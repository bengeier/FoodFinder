{"text":"RA is my favorite place to go for a date night. the crunchy calamari roll and the crazy monkey are so good! the viva Las Vegas roll is good too but it's a little expensive. the fried cinnamon gelato dessert is amazing! the music can be a little loud but the staff is super nice and will move you to a quieter table if you ask. the wait is usually only a few minutes. best sushi place in ahwatukee!!"}
{"text":"We came during happy hour and it was definitely worth it.  The sushi and rolls were about half the regular price. Not sure if we would have come otherwise.  Quality of the sushi was good - don't quite understand all the negative reviews. The Viva Las Vegas roll looked and tasted great.  My husband really liked the tuna.  Salmon was OK, I've had better."}
{"text":"Great location, good hours, and good sushi. Knocked off stars because last time I went, they sat me outside, and there were small black bugs crawling all over the black tabletop. I sat myself somewhere else but told the two receptionists. They said oh, and then went back to talking to each other. During my time eating at the restaurant, no one came to look at the bug situation or clean up the table. The bathroom was also not clean. Makes me wonder what the kitchen is like :/"}
{"text":"I actually love this place. Their happy hour is phenomenal and love the Las Vegas roll. However, yesterday we got the worst service I have ever gotten... The dirty dishes were piled on the table, no one got more water since the first time, my beer took forever to come and food that we order never came in, including soft drinks. Now, based on the service I have revived in the past, I will not judge this place for a one bad time. I will give this place a better rating and review once I visit it again and have the usual service"}
{"text":"This place is tied with Kabuki for the best Sushi in Phoenix, in my opinion.  Atmosphere is a big component of sushi in my book, and RA has nailed it - this is such a comfortable place to relax (we love the bar area). The service is typically great as well.  Our favorite time to go is during reverse happy hour after a movie as it is right next door to AMC."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi Arizona has to offer! Coming from the coast of California I know my good sushi from my bad!  Quite delicious!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate here last night after a much more expensive and less satisfying meal in one of the hotel restaurants.  I had the four fillet mignon medallions with wasabi mashed potatoes.  It was awesome.  She had sushi which was equally good.  The outdoor patio was pleasant.  The whole experience was good.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  We had clients in town and had reserved a space on the patio.  We spoke with the manager 10 minutes before arriving and all was well.  When we arrived, no space was reserved and minimal effort was made to accommodate us.  We stood around the outside bar and waited for an eternity to be served by a bartender who seemed like he'd rather be doing anything else.  Plus, the patio is right next to the trash and grease trap -- nice smell.  The food's OK, the service is among the worst I have encountered."}
{"text":"RA sushi is wonderful. Every waiter/waitress that has ever served me at RA (any of their phoenix metro locations) has been wonderful. They're fantastic at making recommendations on sushi that you might like based on your taste and the drinks there are also great. I have never had anything there that I didn't enjoy. It has a hip and fun atmosphere and it's a great place to go with a group of friends so you can get different flavors of sushi and just split them.  The only thing that bothers me sometimes when I'm there is the volume of the music. It could be a little bit quieter just so conversation is easier, but other than that I have no complaints."}
{"text":"I give this place a 3.5. I went here a bit ago for reverse happy hour. I had gone to RA on Mill Ave once, a looong time ago. I remember thinking it was good before, but I think it's just cause I was not so widely exposed to sushi and plus, the ambience - being on Mill, with friends, during college, and the beginning of a night out - was what made it fun. So, going to this location was all right. The sushi was decent, nothing too special. I did however enjoy the drinks. They had the ingredients available to make my drink, a Geisha Flower. And surprisingly, other sushi joints don't have some ingredients so that's what made, hence the 3.5 and not just a 3."}
{"text":"First off I truly believe that all the other comments are from either employees or drunk tourist whom taste buds must have been burned off. I give this place an A+ for presentation, however for taste all they get is five thumbs down! I would have rather chewed on cock roaches rolled up into seaweed and washed it down wit piss and even that would taste better that what i ate. The service was ok, nothing special though. Prices for the amount of food received was totally not worth it either. Apparently they have a great happy hour for drinks,and because of that I recommend that they remodel their business into a bar, because I've ate better sushi purchased from the grocery store that sat out all day. Save your money if you have working and functional taste buds. If you love the taste of dirt. Then this is the perfect place for you. Oh I visited place Monday Feb 7th around the happy hour time. I'm thinking maybe it's that the chef was drunk from happy hour why my food wasn't the best"}
{"text":"Open during the construction.   Cocktails were excelllent as were the dumplings and katsu chicken."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here all the time......great food!!.....the patio is very fun. Service is great!!!......two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Went to RA last night. Their happy hour has always been one of our favorites. We showed up to find that corporate has decided to butcher the happy hour. Not only were the selections minimal, the quality seemed to suffer greatly as well.  We won't be back, especially with all of the other great happy hours in the area. Nice move corporate! Let's see how that one works out for you."}
{"text":"I like it so much! I ordered Tataki tuna and spicy chicken udon, and that are so good! Come on and try!"}
{"text":"Don't trust a sushi place without a single Japanese person working there.  Sushi was tolerable, but the service was miserable.  Unless you want to wait an hour for your food, don't go."}
{"text":"We have been to different locations if RA Sushi. Dallas and Scottsdale. Although, they weren't anything special, I can say we always got great service and the fish was fresh.   The RA Sushi in Las Vegas was the absolute worst! We didn't go there looking for a 5 star sushi experience, but we went expecting what we get at the other RAs. We had just flown in earlier that day, so we just played dinner by ear. When we got there, it was around 8:30ish. So not busy at all. Plenty of tables. (Should have been a sign) after we were seated it took 10 mins just to get our drink order. We asked our server what kind of tequilas they had. She replied, no one drinks tequila so I don't know. Do you want me to check? We should have left then.   My husband and I settled for water. While we waited for the \"real\" server to come and take our order, my husband and I couldn't even have a conversation because the club music was super loud! Ok, I'm not one of those, no loud music people. If there would have been a lot of people in there to absorb the sound it wouldn't have been so bad, but when our server finally came she couldn't hear us either.   So it was the first part if Feb. and they had just started a Red promotion, with a new roll and a new cocktail. Our server new NOTHING ABOUT IT, even though it was right there in the front of the menu.   So after 30 mins, we got our 2 rolls and tuna tartar. I asked for more wasabi and sarrachi  sauce, never got either. Never got a refill of our waters. We looked around the restaurant and everyone pretty much had the same look of disappointment.   So, it comes time to get our bill and tab out. That took another 30min!  We were so disappointed and annoyed, I wanted to wait to write this review. But I can see, the time passing hasn't changed my opinion or made me soften up on them."}
{"text":"So we usually go to the Old Town location (or Gilbert), but we decided to try the Mill one tonight for happy hour. Super disappointed; we sat outside to enjoy the weather, there were 3 others parties sitting outside. We waited almost 10 min... not one staff member acknowledged us. We left, no service at all. I notified the hostess and [maybe] manager about how they lost our business due to crappy service. Went to Mellow Mushroom and had a great happy hour. Stay away from RA on Mill if you can, Old Town is wayyyy better. RA should be embarrassed by this location."}
{"text":"Had a great time at happy hour! Way busy but that is expected.  Get ready to be seen lots of pretty peeps. Good food, atmosphere and service. Lunch time they are not nearly as busy but happy hour is worth it for the prices you can try many fun dishes...don't forget the vegas rolls theirs is quite nice."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with our service at RA. We went in for happy hour on a weekday. There were very few people in the restaurant. We got a round of drinks and said we needed a minute to decide what we wanted. After waiting for a half hour for her to come back we finally flagged down another waitress and asked for the check. It then took almost 20 minutes to get the check! We were very upset and very hungry. It's the closest sushi place to my house, so I may try going again. I just hope they don't make a habit of completely ignoring their customers."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time with two friends a week ago. We went for their sushi happy hour and it was awesome.  $1 for Sake and half off 22-ounce Kirin.  For appetizers we ordered pineapple cheese wontons, spinach gyoza, shrimp tempura, calamari tempura and vegetable tempura.  These items came out five minutes after we ordered them and the portions were huge, especially the calamari and vegetable!    For sushi we ordered the Crispy Tuna roll, Viva Las Vegas roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, California Roll and Spicy Yellowtail roll.   These rolls arrived at our table right after we got our appetizers.  The Crispy Tuna and Viva Las Vegas rolls were really good! We had all of our food in less than 8 minutes!    For all this food and a couple rounds of drinks we paid under $60!  This is one of the best food bargains on the strip. They also played some great music while we were dining.  I'll definitely be going back on my next visit to vegas!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! Sushi was so fresh and tasty, our server was the sweetest, and the prices were amazing! It was my second time back and even better than I remember! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Netter Service und das Essen ziemlich gut....vorallem Preis-Leistung stimmt, was am Strip eher schwierig zu finden ist...noch was, bis 15:00 gibts ein \"Lunch special\" der wirklch günstig ist."}
{"text":"Disappointing! WAY OVER PRICED for less than average sushi. They try to be too fancy with their roll by smothering them in nuts, fruits, and other things! Some of the combos are just gross! For example, my roll was suppose to have fresh tuna on it but it looked like they had mashed the tuna up and molded it like catnip on top of my roll! Then, our seared tuna was completely covered with huge chunks of cracked pepper and sesame seeds...that's all you could even taste! Nothing was impressive. For a $90 tab, I was hoping for at least average!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere here...  its a little loud at times but that's a sign if a good time!  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  But I may stop in for a drink next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Good sushi overall.  A little pricey for the fancier sushi, but during happy hour you can get pretty good deals.  Nice atmosphere.  Drinks are expensive."}
{"text":"Die Ra Sushi Bar ist ein sehr gutes Japanisches Restaurant in der Fashion Shopping Mall auf dem Strip in Las Vegas. Vor allem mittags lohnt sich ein Besuch. Zu dieser Zeit werden viele günstige Mittagsangebote offeriert. Z.B. die üppigen Bento Boxen mit Steak oder gegrilltem Lachs, Pickles, Salat einem Gyoza und einer Frühlingsrolle für nur $ 8,- (siehe Fotos). Damit wird man gut satt und die Qualität ist super, für den Preis eigentlich unschlagbar.    Sushi und Sashimi sind vergleichsweise recht teuer. Zwei Nigiri kosten um die $ 5,- bis $ 7,-. Diese können alle einzeln bestellt werden, so dass man sich seine gewünschte Platte zusammenstellen kann.    Die Atmosphäre im Restaurant ist sehr nett und gemütlich und Angestellten waren allesamt aufmerksam und freundlich und nicht zu amerikanisch...kann man wirklich weiter empfehlen."}
{"text":"I love meeting friends here. The atmosphere is fun and the sushi is pretty decent. Unfortunately I don't have too much sushi experience to compare it to and I'm sure it's not the best sushi place out there, but I have never been disappointed here.  Mostly my friends and I go for happy hour. They have some great deals on basic sushi and appetizer choices, and can someone say sake bombers? So down some beer and sake, stuff yourself on sushi and just have fun.  I also have been here a couple of times for lunch and I love the bento boxes. The spicy tuna bowl is pretty good too. Pair it with some green tea and it makes for a satisfyingly different lunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Sushi spots in Vegas. Food is always fresh, the music is always an upbeat vibe! The Spicy Miso is my favorite, for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm actaully not a huge fan of sushi, but my friends like to go here. Happy hour here is good, as has been mentioned."}
{"text":"A nice little sushi place. I'm not big on sushi, really, but they do all right here. Their happy hour food specials are why I went, and I wasn't disappointed. I had the spicy shrimp roll and tuna nigiri and they were tasty and fresh; plus, they only costed something like $8 together. The lady had kalbi, and it was okay. Giving them the benefit of the doubt on the kalbi, since I guess this isn't so much of a Korean specialty place.  The restaurant has a nice atmosphere, clean and modern. Our waitress was nice enough."}
{"text":"This place is getting only 2 stars because of its ambience. I got the worst case of food poisoning after I had sushi there. Not sure whether it was Mohito and sushi combination or food just wasn't fresh enough but all the money I spent at the bar literally went down the drain and I feel like I will never eat sushi again...Thanks, manager Collin, but I don't believe it takes 24 hours to feel sick if you ate something bad"}
{"text":"i do not know why this place doesn't have better reviews. I have been here 4 times in the last 2 months and the service and food are exceptional. So good that I don' t even mind the wait. The Viva Las Vegas roll is like no roll I have ever had! must try!!"}
{"text":"Sushi was OK, nothing special. Waitress was good, prompt, etc. Busser chased me away from my table, even though they weren't busy, and there were plenty of other tables. That was no fun (probably did it because i was by myself) and not worth the mediocre sushi. The waitress got a good tip,but i won't be coming here again."}
{"text":"Great food and service! We had several appetizers and sashimi, all was very good! We did not try the sushi, but the faces at the next table were pretty happy ;-)"}
{"text":"What the heck is the vegan doing at a sushi bar? Eating kick ass sushi!   This is my second experience dining at Ra and it was a good one! The veggie rolls are great. Stuffed with avocado and asparagus and super delicious. My only complaint is that our rolls fell apart, a problem that my girlfriend has had in the past here and that we did not encounter at Ra's Old Town Scottsdale location.  I was notified that the vegetable tempura rolls were also vegan, except that they are fried in the same oil as poultry and seafood. There was no noticeable fish and/or chicken taste so it's edible, IMO. This had squash (I think) and eggplant and was served with an eel sauce (V).  It was really loud, being late night on a Friday. But our server was very helpful. It is pricey, though! Each roll we got was $6-7 and when you add a sake bomber you're looking at an expensive night. Looking forward to going back for happy hour some day."}
{"text":"I visited RA for the first time last week after a long day of shopping at Fashion Show and it was fantastic!  Got a whole array of different rolls to split amongst the group.  We kept it pretty simple with spicy tuna rolls, yellowtail and scallion rolls, philadelphia rolls and the crispy tuna rolls.  Delicious and super fresh fish!  Also, the sake bombs were really great here.  The prices were very reasonable and we even convinced the table next to us to join us in the fun.  The decor is clean and modern and the waitstaff is friendly and doesn't rush you to get out (even when's there's a line of people waiting)."}
{"text":"Food is always great! Tootsy Maki is always awesome. The music is always great. But the service... The service could be so much better. I came here with my daugther, sister, and some co-workers. I had surgery that restricted me to a certain type of drink. The waiter said I had to throw my drink away do to health code. I was fine with that so I put my bottle in my purse. I asked for water so I could add my protein powder in the water provided.  I was mid way finished with my drink and instead of her asking could she refill she reached across the table and refilled my protein powdered water with lemon water. WTF? Also the booth we were in smelled funky, like dish water... eeek! I will still come for the Tootsy Makie and Tempura Shrimp but I will make sure I always sit outside."}
{"text":"I used to enjoy coming here for happy hour, but recently they've had the worst management ever. The waitresses are mostly very nice but the managers (besides Dave) are the worst. I'll never come back here again after Joe (?) blatantly insulted my guests last time we were there. This guy needs to go. I'm definitely not coming back until he does."}
{"text":"We still love this place; still come in all the time, still love the food and drink... But as we were sitting at the bar at 11:39, a gentleman came in to order to go food. The bartender told them no, that the kitchen already did last call. If your online webpage and the hours at your door say serves food until midnight... I expect to be served food until midnight. If I got off work, rushed over to put in my to go order 30 minutes before the kitchen was supposed to close, and then was told no... I'd be pissed."}
{"text":"Had a great dining experience at RA Sushi. Our server \"Eden\", I believe was her name, (slim with tattoos on her arms) did a superb job. She was very knowledgeable about the menu items, even recommended some which I ended up selecting. She was very attentive and extremely nice.   Food and drinks were amazing.   Looking forward to dining here from now on whenever I'm in town from California.     (Dined around 7pm on 1/26/16)"}
{"text":"Possible the worst sushi meal I've ever had, and one of the most expensive.  The rice was actually crunchy.  The service wasn't great either.    Please don't go here.  Try Kabuki; they're great."}
{"text":"I come to RA if not once a month, every other month. They have amazing sushi. I haven't tried any other option, but my family enjoys the Teryaki bowl. The best roll is the Viva Las Vegas roll, and their garlic edamame is amazing. They also have a \"happy hour\" from I think its 4p-7pm. Awesome deals on drinks and the sushi. Only sushi place I feel comfortable going to."}
{"text":"Love coming here for lunch - the bartender is friendly and attentive, and the tuna tacos are great.   The music is too loud and sucks, though. Like, offensively bad. They pump out dance tunes you might hear at the Gap - droning thump + auto tuned girl voices - the kind that make you wish you had been aborted."}
{"text":"I have gone to this location a few times before, but will not be returning after my last experience. My group was sat outside near a TV as requested so we could watch the football game, and were eventually attended to by Paige, our waitress. She was rude, distracted, and gave the impression she could not care less about what she was doing. She rarely came to our table and when she did, she was gruff and short with us, and hardly gave us time to say two words. The food was decent, as it always is, but the service ruined the experience. Sushi and drinks for 4 people is not cheap, and I expect good service and a friendly waitress for what we paid. As a fellow server myself, I understand not every day is a good one, but treating your customers poorly is unacceptable and reflects badly on the business. I will not be returning to this location again"}
{"text":"Most overpriced sushi I've had. Only when I'm desperate and stranded on Mill will I suffer this usurious place.   The rolls are small to the point of feeling like you are eating bite size sushi, mind you at a jumbo sized price.   No, no, and no."}
{"text":"I don't know - it just seems like looking at Ra these days is like looking at an aging rock star trying to hang on to better days.  There was a time when I would have given this place 3 or 4 stars but the last few visits have been less than impressive.  Uninspired rolls, at times with stale fish, mediocre service, tired decor.  Maybe it's because there used to be fewer alternatives in the Valley.  Maybe it's because I've been to more really good sushi places since then but something just isn't working for me.  If you're new to sushi or like the more basic rolls (California, anything with 'krab'); if your first consideration is the quality of the happy hour prices; or if you feel it's just not 'in' without heavy house music in the background, by all means give it a shot."}
{"text":"I've been going to Ra Sushi for 20 yrs.  Good place to go for consistent sushi, however it's slowly becoming over priced and sushi is average at best. There are so many better options in Scottsdale and any other city where Ra is located.  Happy hour used to be good, but prices went up and so did their ego because they are so corporate and comfortable with the fact that they are so non-hip anymore.   Bringing in a new washed up DJ won't save them."}
{"text":"Overall pretty good experience. We came in with a party of 20 and they were very quick to get us settled. Sushi was ok. I think they tried to do too much with it. Multiple sauces and extravagant garnish took away from the fish. Get location and atmosphere. With our large group the server was organized and efficient with orders, running food, LOTS of booze, and splitting checks."}
{"text":"Located at the Fashion Show Mall on the strip this place is amazing!   Let me put it this way I went here for lunch with my mother at 1:30 and I came back at 5 with the rest of my family for more.   I had the spicy miso soup which is a very large serving- it can feed like 4 people. IT was flavor full and filled with all the veggies and goodies that I love  I also had the Calamari and omg this calamari was so soft and tender that it felt like you were eating jello. But don't get me wrong the batter was still so crispy that it was so addictive.   I also enjoyed the crispy onion albacore, it was so delicious that the second time we went we order three plates!   The Tropical roll was to die for! So basically it had cucumber, mango and avocado rolled onto some spinach tempura bits. But the thing that made it amazing was the mango salsa that they threw on top of it all that gave it a refreshing and unique flavor.   The Viva Las Vegas is something that you should enjoy...well when you are in Vegas! So so tasty, there is just so much in it and so much going on the flavors are like a punch to the mouth!   For dessert we had something like a banana split roll, it was like a egg roll with a banana in it sliced up like sushi. Then it had strawberries and chocolate drizzled on top. It was the perfect way to end the meal.   Stop by for happy hour because it's well worth the trip!   Happy Eatings! =]"}
{"text":"My wife and I made an early reservation here (at about 4pm) because it was near-ish (is that a word? Lol) to her Dr. appointment. We had seen this place on Yelp once before and decided to bookmark it.   Let me tell you what, from the moment we walked in, it was a very pleasant experience. The staff was inviting and friendly upon our arrival. The place wasn't busy, which I personally was happy about, and it meant a quieter atmosphere. When we sat at the sushi bar there was a very kind chef behind the bar making the rolls from scratch and doing an excellent job. Our server was quick to attend to us and got our appetizers started right away. We had the veggie combo tempura and the salted edamame which was free because it was our first visit.    Choosing what sushi to order was so tough, because everything looked Amazing! We tried a few things and even striked up a conversation with the chef to ask what his favorite thing was, and what he would recommend. We ordered the vegetarian roll, the Viva Las Vegas roll, the yellow tail nigiri style and one of the rolls recommended by the chef. Everything was Amazing! We haven't had sushi that good since we left Oahu a couple of years ago.   We will be returning regurally. I'm still sitting here remembering how excellent the sushi was and the dessert we had was very good as well.  Everyone there who waiting on us, who we talked to, who made the food was great. I can't recommend this place enough. Just go, you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Food took forever. We ordered two rolls they for got one. His reason was they were \"busy\" and they were not. Never came to check up on us. Servers name was Eric."}
{"text":"My Fiancée and I went here to celebrate our engagement. We were so excited and happy until we sat down. The hostess was rude and didn't say anything to us. The waitress was worse. My fiancée and I got the wrong food and when we tried telling her she said that's what you ordered and walked away. We told the rude hostess again, nothing was done. We just paid the bill and left. I will never be back."}
{"text":"I love sushi, but try to avoid the RA sushi restaurants. I was invited to meet friends for happy hour, so I thought I would see if anything has changed since i was here last. NO. Service was mediocre at best, the waiter was inattentive and forget our requests on numerous occasions. The fish, wasn't horrible, but definitely nothing to write home about. I had maguro, unagi. spicy tuna roll, and the vegas roll. Nothing struck me as super fresh, the key ingredient to a great sushi experience. I would never of my own choice go to eat here."}
{"text":"Sushi is amazing and they actually have some great beers for a sushi bar. Great atmosphere and great service."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!! Was on vacation and google sushi, RA sushi came up so my lady and I drove 20+ min and it was absolutely worth the drive.  I will recommend this restaurant to anyone who asks or needs a great sushi place!  Bravo!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and the hottest hostesses in all of Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I would say the reviews are pretty acurate for this place.  If you want a quiet meal this is definitely not your place.  The music was quite loud and it was packed (30 minute wait for a table for 2) so we ate at the sushi bar.  Seaweed salad = good, tasted just like one from our local sushi restaurant in Modesto.  Happy hour drinks = sapporo for $3.  some of the rolls and appetizers are also 1/2 off but did not show up on our bill.  we didn't feel like arguing because the price wasn't extreme and we had already had misscommunications with the waitress when she brought seasoned squid instead of seaweed salad.  Catepillar roll, yellowtail nigiri, and gojira roll were good but nothing spectacular. We ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll because it was 1/2 on happy hour menu.  the pieces were so big I had to cut them in half with my chopstick to fit it in my mouth!  the toasted chip like thing on top of the pieces of roll tasted like a spicy Dorito chip.  Fun place to experience but I don't feel a strong desire to go back if I\"m ever in Scottsdale again."}
{"text":"Great value on the Vegas strip! After enduring some ridiculously overpriced, mediocre meals during our visit to the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas, we were happy to find a place with excellent food and prices more reasonable than back home (suburban Washington DC).   The husband and I started off with a bang with bottles of sake for $4-which is incredibly reasonable- while kids had strawberry lemonade served all fancy with kosher salt on the glass rims.   The special rolls- seasonal, dragon, and Gojira, had standout flavors and were large enough to be a stand-alone meal for some (though not for my teens or husband lol). My chirashi bowl was just right- neatly cut pieces of fish, cucumber, and avocado, and a tasty yet not overpowering sauce, served over perfectly cooked and seasoned rice. It was a very generous portion-equivalent to several large rolls- for only the price of a specialty roll. My only criticism is that the menu stated it was supposed to be served with soup, which it was not. I did not complain however, because as it was I was so full (as was everyone else in my family) I couldn't quite finish the bowl so the soup would have went to waste.  The service was friendly and they frequently refilled our waters and cleared dishes which is a big plus in my book.  Too bad they won't be open tomorrow morning, so we will probably be spending the same amount of money as tonight's dinner on a way-overpriced hotel breakfast."}
{"text":"I was a sushi virgin and based on the reviews this was probably the wrong place to pop my cherry.  But I did and it was simply alright.  I had the california rolls which were edible and I ate the entire thing.  I smothered them in soy sauce and focused on the rice.   The only problem was it was really dark and I thought the dollop of wasabi was a stray slice of avocado so my first bite was an entire mouthful of wasabi which made me nearly double over in mouth-searing agony.  I flailed frantically until I found my beer which I promptly inhaled as a means of quenching the tartar-esque inferno raging in my mouth.   After I quenched it, I managed to choke down the rest of the rice, avocado and partially uncooked fish.  The sum of my experience is the unshakable notion that people don't really like sushi.  It's not as good as real fish and it's dangerous and more than a little creepy.  I think this is one of those foods you pretend to like in order to seem cool.  But, hey, I'm just a burger guy.  The service was great, my waittress pleasant and the vibe pretty cool for a cheesey college scene.  Plus the Sunday happy hour is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Great Sushi, great drinks, great service and most of all -great staff!   After a couple of visits -the staff miraculously remembers what you and your friends ordered to drink or eat!  I was meeting a friend there so I ordered my drink and the service connoisseur asked what my guest would like and I couldn't remember what he drank!  She asked me if he had been there before with me and I said yes -and began to describe him amongst the group that was with us last time --she immediately said \"oh yes, he had a \"drink name here\" and said she would bring him a cold one to be ready for when he arrives\"......amazing -I still can't remember what he drank -but the fact that she remembers you when you come in -and can remember you if you aren't even there yet....that's what I call excellent service and a true connection with your customers!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Left 10 minutes from the time of being seated. Nobody came to our table during that time. It was not busy at all in the restaurant.  We were set to spend good money for my son's birthday.  Ended up at an amazing Sushi place on Scottsdale Rd and and Papago!!!"}
{"text":"I have gluten and soy food allergies and they were willing and able to accommodate me wish sashimi and RA-lipop roll. Didn't wait forever for food. Waitress was awesome!!! Good food :) would recommend."}
{"text":"Mleh.  This is the douchebag, trendy, techno, college, bimbo place to be.  The sushi itself is nothing special.  If you're looking for good sushi, there are many better places to go.  If you're looking for everything most people hate about Scottsdale, you've found it at RA."}
{"text":"I hate to give this place one star, because the staff was friendly, but the food was just really bad.  The sushi and sashimi just had no taste to it all.  Very bland.  As was the salad and the miso soup.  I went there because it had high ratings on Foursquare, and wasn't supposed to be overly expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for.  I was very disappointed, and left still hungry, went somewhere else to get something more to eat."}
{"text":"I love RA's happy hour! Great rolls and appetizers for half price, perfect time to try something new. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My gripe is that when you serve imitation crab meat you MUST let people know.  Seriously, there are a lot of allergy sufferers out here and I am one and I do not like having an allergic reaction to something I should not have one to!  If you are going to serve nasty fly by night imitation food, I really can't eat there.  Sushi is sushi and it should be real and fresh.  Enough said!"}
{"text":"Upon entering the restaurant decor looks great.. a tad to dark for my liking but..we were seated towards the back in a booth.  It smelled like strong urine.. totally gross odor.. thought maybe when I went outside there would be an alley along the outer wall where homeless people lived..so very rank!"}
{"text":"If you're still in Vegas on a Sunday night, RA Sushi is a MUST!! Happy hour prices are available on sunday nights. I'm talking about $2.50-$5.00 a roll!!! One of the best places to have sushi on the strip.The last three times I've been to Vegas, we ordered the entire Happy Hour menu, which is about 15-18 items, all for roughly $45!!!! Be sure you have plenty of people to share it with, I suggest about 4 people! Imagine, $10 per person for an assortment of sushi and other Japanese dishes!! You cannot find good quality food at this price that will leave you satisfied in Vegas anywhere!! My favorites are the Coconut Shrimp Tempura and the Scallop Dynamite!! YUMMM!!!  The party never stops in Vegas,  so expect loud music spun by an in house DJ (of course with a pre-made set), plasma screen tv's and a full bar!! Great atmosphere for the non-stop party animals!!   Happy Hour prices are also available for sake and beer, just $6 for both.   This place can get a bit crowded around 8PM, so anticipate a long wait, or try to come early, or even try to come in late after the ideal dinner time. I believe Happy Hour starts at 6PM and ends at 12AM. Make sure your order is in before 12 to keep happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Decor: 5/5 Drinks: 3.5/5 Food: 1/5 Service: -1/5 Management: 4/5  Never have I complained to a restaurant manager before, but the service my friends and I received here was so sub-par, we had to speak up.  6 of us came here for a late lunch at the recommendation of a friend. It was our last day in Vegas, and we let our server know that we had to be at the airport in about 3 hours. She said it wasn't a problem. And then it all went downhill from there. How so?  - despite telling her our time constraints, it took her over half an hour to come take our food orders (the restaurant was half full) - plus almost an hour and a half for our food to actually reach our table - everyone's food (w/ the exception of my friend who ordered sushi) was overcooked and oversalted and generally not enjoyable  The kicker: - she brought the wrong dish for one of my friends, yet wouldn't apologize or admit to her mistake!!!!! She didn't offer to make it right or anything. When we told her, she said \"oh, okay\" and walked away.  Knowing how long our food took, we didn't have time to send the wrong dish back because we wouldn't get to the airport in time. So my friend just ended up eating whatever the server brought him.  After bringing our food orders, this server avoided our table like the plague. We couldn't find her for drink refills or even the bill when we wanted to leave. I've never had such bad service in my life! Eventually, we had the hostess locate the manager for us so we could make an official complaint. He was apologetic and ended up comping our food for us, which was unexpected but kind of him. If only he had been more on top of his servers from the get go!  Never again. There are too many other restaurants on the Strip to subject myself to this crappy level of service again.  PS Julia S, I think we may have had the same server!"}
{"text":"There is nothing negative to say about the food.  It is delicious; THAT is the only reason I've been back three times.  However, it's not good enough to put up with the terrible service and lack there of.  Not one time have these servers been able to get the order correct.   They continually bring the wrong food that was never ordered. And when you want to have another drink or water glasses refilled, they are nowhere around. When your bill is  presented, there is an extra charge for something you never ordered or received.  It hasn't happened just once, but all three times I've gone there.  Enough is enough!!!!!  I'm sure I can find another restaurant that serves good food, but also cares about their customers.  I was with three other people and we all feel the same way."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy eating at RA Sushi, especially at a prime location such as Las Vegas, but I was quite disappointed with my latest experience. It was a pretty slow night and the service was still unusually slow. Also, we requested ginger but it was never brought to us."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised.    We walked in there at 10:30 on a Friday night, were immediately greeted, seated and waited on.  The service was great.  I had hamachi sashimi, spicy tuna hand-roll, rice & soup.  The fish was fresh, buttery and a fair portion.  The hand-roll was made with a rice wrapper instead of nori.  I can see where this could be an issue because in my vast experience, nori is the default wrap of choice & the rice wrap is normally an option that is asked for.  But it tasted good enough and the amount of tuna it was wrapped around  was generous and it was fresh.  The soup and rice were good.  My friend had your basic spicy tuna roll and another item I don't recall, and he was pleased also.  The price was very reasonable, especially considering the quality of the food and the slick, touristy Old Town location."}
{"text":"Good Happy Hour specials on drinks, sushi and select apps until 7pm.  Service was okay... My fiance who is living out in Scottsdale for two months loves this place, but he likes every sushi place.  We ordered way too much food and it was all just okay.  Liked the shrimp tempura and the spicy tuna rolls but hated the crispy soft shell crab."}
{"text":"Mediocre to almost not worth it sushi, service was the slowest in the world. Rolls were of same caliber I can find at qfc or central market (local grocery stores with sushi islands)...horrible service on top of that....SLOW!"}
{"text":"Nice big location to sit outside and eat. I went on a weekday early afternoon. It was really busy and loud while I was there and other than it taking a long time initially the service was still decently fast throughout my meal, almost to the point of rushing me out - but at least my server was friendly.  Lunch specials are good but the restaurant and menus were really dirty to the point of being kind of gross and almost not wanting to touch them.  I got the sashimi lunch special and the rice it came with was NOT seasoned sushi rice, it was plain steamed white rice - what is with that? Disappointing and really unexpected - you order what is essentially a chirashi bowl and get nasty dry long grain rice.  This was my first time at a Ra and I definitely wouldn't recommend it, at least not this particular location. If you're in Vegas and want casual sushi I'm sure there are much much better places."}
{"text":"Again this a love/hate place. I love it, me and my wife like to go here on a Friday night, we like the atmosphere and the loud music, sushi is good and they have a good happy hour."}
{"text":"The Maki Sushi rolls at RA were slap yo mama good! It tasted like avocado, rice, and crab had a party in my mouth. I have a pretty sophisticated pallet and was a bit skeptical that the quality of the California roll here could surpass that of my local H.E.B. Grocery store... But it did! And I loved it."}
{"text":"Love Sushi...sometimes understaff....Like the live & dj Music..."}
{"text":"Solid chain sushi joint. Everything tasty but nothing out of this world. We came with a party of 6. Ordered tons of food. Tempura come out hot and crispy. Sushi came out quickly and efficiently. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. Service was friendly and and knowledgeable. But when asked for a second sake is took forever to get to our table. Over all. I'd go back."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and ate at RA a couple of years ago with friends. At that time, we loved it so when we came to town this time we made it a point to go back. This time we were extremely disappointed! My husband and I wanted to have a nice dinner after traveling all day but when we walked in the door we were immediately like, \"this isn't what I remember.\" They had LOUD club-like music playing, so loud that you couldn't even hear yourself think. Luckily we got sat outside and the music wasn't as bad out there but come on...at a restaurant you shouldn't have to yell over music to talk to people at your own table. Then comes the food, it was mediocre. The grilled veggies were WAY TOO SALTY, so salty I had to to rinse them with my drinking water to eat them (I really don't like sending food back if I can salvage it bc I hate waste so I made do). The RA-lollipop was really good. The sashimi was just ok and the lettuce wraps were terrible...\"lightly battered tempura shrimp\" my butt, heavily battered and pretty much nothing but batter for everything in the lettuce wrap. I've never had such a disgusting lettuce wrap. They are usually a pretty safe bet. Needless to say, this place really needs to improve their sushi game, we were highly disappointed in the environment and food!!"}
{"text":"The sushi rolls are subpar and the the service has a lot of (bad) attitude (other than the sushi bat guys who are fast and friendly). The staff at the front try hard to make you feel unwelcome and act like they are doing you a favor seating you. They carding policy is ridiculous. I know it's college town and everything but when you are in your 40s and they won't bring you a beer on a Saturday night because one of the two has forgotten their license, it is time to say bye bye. Which we did. Happy hour at the sushi bar is still ok in a pinch."}
{"text":"Why would anyone think that being force-fed BLARING-LOUD electronic music on a Sunday night is a good accompaniment to a nice sit down sushi dinner? I am far from an old fogie; I'm in my early 30s and I live in L.A., so it's not like I haven't had my fair share of nights out, but this was ridiculous. UNCE-UNCE-POW-WAAARRRNNN-UMPH-UMPH for an hour as I shouted at the waiter and screamed at my family in an attempt to make natural conversation. When I reluctantly became \"that guy\" and asked the waiter if they could turn the clearly too loud pounding techno down, he did his best, but I was informed that \"there was a DJ here tonight\" - to be fair they did turn it down to almost-acceptable limits but it crept back up to deafening. Just bad. Who wants a PA speaker dubstep over sushi? I guess the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"I don't understand why the average rating for Ra is 2 1/2 stars!  Ok, so, the food isn't \"the best\" (I've had sushi in San Francisco, Honolulu, Manhattan, Seattle, L.A., San Diego, Miami, Boston, basically anywhere where you expect great fresh sushi)  That being said, it's good for the value.  Really \"great\" sushi is expensive!  Anybody expecting that should not come to Ra, and/or give it a bad review because of that.  People come to Ra for the GREAT Happy Hour and the fun/young/hip atmosphere.  I give all that 4 stars. One of the BEST tofu apps I've EVER had. (if you do try that app, make sure to ask for lots of the little crunchies on top, and extra eel sauce on the side, those are the best parts, and sometimes they put too little) The tofu is cooked firm on the outside and creamy on the inside, so good! The veg tempura is good too, and at about $3 appiece, you CAN'T beat it! Still the BEST Vegas rolls I've had anywhere!  I wouldn't really come here off of Happy Hour, but that is because I am broke.  However I would really like to try some of the menu items I've never had.  (I've had regular menu items, and they were good too)  The patio is nice, especially with the great weather we have here, but I wish they had a smoking patio.   One thing that I've read on other reviews that is absolutely true = you will want to sit on the patio, unless you don't want to hear your friends, since the music is WAY too loud inside. (but it's sometimes loud outside too!) That would be cool for a Fri/Sat late night, but they blast the music even on weekdays starting at the 3 o'clock Happy Hour!  I've read some knocks on the waitresses.  I've never really had a bad experience with them.  Ra does it right like every bar/restaurant should do and hires young attractive women.  They've always been really nice and friendly too."}
{"text":"Awful to go service. Receptionist seemed annoyed the whole time and that I wasn't worth it. While I waited for my order went to the bar for a drink for 5 min and the bartender decided chatting with her staff was more important. I've been coming here for years and not sure I will be returning."}
{"text":"They're quite lucky to have such a great location, and I imagine that explains much of the crowd inside. The sushi was mediocre-ish to bad, and the service was seriously lacking. It's a shame, as it sort of ruined my birthday to eat there..."}
{"text":"I went to RA  for happy hour last Thursday night and had a great time. They have pretty good happy hour specials. RA isn't my favorite sushi place because it's pretty standard, but it's consistent. The pineapple chicken appetizer is a must have. Good people watching, good service."}
{"text":"First time here and will tell u we sat there for 20 min and didn't even have anyone approach us for a drink order! Everyone that came in after us had service and drinks right away! First and last time we will ever go there! Guess there was a reason we were avoiding that crappy service establishment!"}
{"text":"I definitely prefer this location over Old town...parking...enough said. The atmosphere seems a bit more relaxed as well.  The sushi is decent and for the price you can't go wrong. If you're wanting a fun place for happy hour this is good choice. It can get a bit loud."}
{"text":"Disappointed and confused...I just called Ra hoping to place an order for pick up. I realize its late and knew there was a good chance the kitchen may be closed. Here in yelp it says they close in 27 minutes. So I called and in the message it says that in friday and saturday they are open til 1am. But apperantly theyre closed at 12:27am? Am I missing something? So maybe someone from Ra could either post the actual hours of operation. Or hire employees that can keep the restaurant open during the hours of operation.  Sounds like a place to strt right? I have heard good things of Ra, but giving 1 star because I wasnt able to try any of the food or drinks because they closed early on a saturday night. Thanks, I doubt ill make anoher attemot, lots of places are open."}
{"text":"Terrible service! I had a tremendously snotty teenage hostess seat my family and I. From the moment I walked in I could tell she was in a bad mood but that doesn't give her an excuse to throw a fit when I ask to be reseated and throw the menu at me. Later on, her friends came in and she sat them at a better table and was way friendlier. Every time I saw her she had an attitude. Listen sweetie it's easy to pretend to like your job fortunately for me I won't be coming back to see you try."}
{"text":"My friends and I have a standing Friday night sushi date and we have never been disappointed with the service or the flood. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Pro: some of the best sushi I've ever had!  Tempura is very lightly coated, everything very fresh delicious   Cons: order everything the first time through and don't  expect to ever see your waitress again. Not very busy and when we ordered a second dish after the first order it took over 30 minutes to get it. Our green tea never did make it to the table."}
{"text":"Trendy, over priced, typical snotty scottsdale attitudes. The only thing they have that I adore is their iced green tea. It is super yummy, but not worth enduring the price and attitude for."}
{"text":"Great place for fresh sushi!  I do wish they had more of a description on the menus, but the servers are super helpful.  Sign up for their newsletters and you get a $20 half birthday coupon!"}
{"text":"RA Sushi is always grey! This one was no exception. We had a great time and the Service was great. You can always trust that you'll have good food when you come to one of these even if they are a little pricey."}
{"text":"Always great food and drinks. Most of the time great service. Go there about twice a month, only had maybe two slow service encounters. Will keep going here for date night."}
{"text":"Had Sushi here during a Convention at Sands Expo/Venetian.  Had another high-end sushi place earlier in the week and this was just as good, but much better service and prices without the hassle of convention crowds (even though it was right across Las Vegas BLVD and a short walk from the Expo)!!      Cornell was our waiter and I have food allergies and he made sure everything was ordered exactly how I wanted it.  He was prompt, full of energy, making suggestions and made the experience that much more fun!  The patio looking onto the strip was great and I appreciated that I could also watch sports on the nice outdoor TV's.  The inside is definitely very nice and intimate if that is your style.  Marty, the GM, was outstanding too.  We were so impressed with Cornell's performance, we had a good chat with Marty.  Service is about selling and taking care of the customer- Cornell did both as good as it gets!  Thank you!    Will definitely be taking groups back to Ra next time in Vegas!  Outstanding Service and food and a great location right on the top part of the strip!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Went here the other night for late night happy hour and the food was fresh and amazingly tasty. Their cucumber margarita was a thumbs up. The yellowtail sashimi on happy hour was great yet they could lay off the sauce. Other than that, shrimp tempura was lightly fried and delicious, rainbow roll was what I expected and the service was impeccable."}
{"text":"I was tempted to give it 3 stars, but really....why?  I had been here once before and remembered it was ok -- I'd had some fancy pants roll then.  I returned and sought them out for the Happy Hour, and yes -- the prices were pretty good and I may even go back.  I started with tuna nigiri, to test the waters and see how the fish tasted.  It was edible but not great quality so I decided to try some other stuff.  Got some roll called tootsy something that had crab, shrimp, that kind of thing -- it was way too sweet -- I guess the crunchies and the eel sauce were too much for me.  The scallop/mushroom dish was frickin' tasty though, and if I go back for their happy hour I'm totally getting 2 of those and hitting the sake again."}
{"text":"I think the key to eating here is to go during HAPPY HOUR!! Otherwise, yeah, I'd agree with other Yelpers that paying $14 for a 5 piece speciality sushi roll is ridiculous. However, I had no problem eating the same roll for $7.75! ;)  When we first got here the hostess was seating a party of 2 in front of us, which was a very slow process. Then she came back and blankly said, \"How can I help you?\" Umm, how do you think you can help us? What kind of greeting is that? lol. Obviously we want help getting a table for 3. And thanks for being so friendly! Once sat, our server was nice and took good care of us.  Happy hour drink specials are about $2 cheaper than usual so it's not that great of a deal, but again, we saved almost 50% on the food...and it was delicious!  Between the 3 of us, we had edamame (nice and salty), crispy spicy tuna rice balls (4 of them - would be a rip-off normally), pork potstickers, spicy salmon roll, spicy calamari roll (very good), and 2 Viva Las Vegas rolls (fancy looking and mmmmm)!  They brought out the food as it was ready - meaning everything came out at different times (this would be really annoying to most people, but it worked out well for us since we were trying so many things and had a chance to enjoy them one at a time).   I liked the black and red interior too. Bottom line, this place is not as bad as other reviews make it sound. I liked it and would totally come back - but only between 4:00-7:00p.m. If you pay full price, you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a pre movie meal and found the food to be quite good. Was also pleasantly surprised by the service and attention to customer satisfaction."}
{"text":"I have been to this play many times and I am satisfied every single time I go there. The service is great, along with the happy hour menu. Great place to end a day of work!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple of weeks ago and was a little disappointed with the service. We went through 4 different servers within a matter of 10 minutes and had to ask 3 times for the little bowls for our soy sauce. We plan to go back, but hope the service is better than it previously was."}
{"text":"I love RA!! the food anyways. The wait staff is actually pretty rude! Went late morning early afternoon and the place was dead!! It took 10 minutes just for the waitress to come ask what we waited to drink!!! i could understand if it was busy but it wasnt. I havent been back since! Love the food but I wont return for the simple fact of horrible service."}
{"text":"We love sushi and RA is one of our absolute favorite spots. It's a great atmosphere and the green tea is my favorite I've ever had."}
{"text":"I made a reservation through yelp both times I ate here(Friday and Saturday night). Seating was immediately available, the service was quick, the waitresses pleasant, the food came out quick and was delicious. The only thing that annoyed me was the music on Friday night was insanely loud. Great overall though."}
{"text":"A pricy place to grab a bite. The plating of the food is beautiful, but the portions are a little small for the money. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, but I could barely hold a conversation over all the noise. I was taken aback at how loud it was. There was a DJ spinning as well and, to put it nicely, I wasn't a fan of his \"skills\". The noise volume absolutely smothered the meal and destroyed the atmosphere for me."}
{"text":"This was a great stop for happy hour!  The prices were very reasonable and the food was good.  Our drinks were all fantastic as well as the service.  The forgot one of our items, but otherwise it was a wonderful stop along the strip with decent sushi."}
{"text":"Service was poor....did not serve the full lunch combinations but insisted on charging full price. Caution! This location is not ready for early arrivers."}
{"text":"The Vegas Roll is my absolute favorite!!!! I love the ambiance of the restaurant and I'm always in good company. I've never had a bad fish or drink here.... I'm borderline addicted..lol"}
{"text":"When I used to work at Fashion Show mall this was a fav of mine to grab some lunch because they had bento boxes for decent prices, especially for strip prices. I used to get the teriyaki chicken bento box. Their happy hour is also good considering again it is on the strip. Good prices for drinks and food, during happy hour!"}
{"text":"This is 2 be time and last time! Ordered teriyaki plate and it was bland, no flavor whatsoever! Horrible value"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to get inexpensive sushi. It's hot and quick and not pricey. It's always busy though. I ate here during happy hour yesterday and there was a wait. Always good though and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Tuna tartar with wonton chips is delicious and fresh. Sushi is par. They use imitation crab, which is a pet peeve of mine. Place was a little dirty, but service was good."}
{"text":"first time experiencing sushi and was a great experience!! would diffinately come back to aany RA SUSHI place!!"}
{"text":"I think this still has my favorite sushi in the Valley.  Hoping to find one that trumps it but haven't yet.  Great atmosphere and crowd."}
{"text":"The edamame is a little under done. Service is extremely slow, waited for more than 20 mins for a salad and a roll. Feel super thirsty after.   Don't think I'd come back..."}
{"text":"I didn't know Ra was a chain.  The only reason why we stopped in here was because I heard the happy hour specials were awesome.  Well, price-wise I was impressed.  Taste-wise, I can't complain given that it's a chain restaurant.  I will add that we were the only Asians in the restaurant so no Japanese employees.  The fact that they serve the \"beer and sake\" special with the ochoko inside the beer mug is a strong indication of the clientle at this establishment."}
{"text":"It's okay. Between Olive Garden, Denny's, Friendly's and this place I'd rather eat here but the sushi is strictly eh. The atmosphere is hip enough but the music is anti-sushi techno rap. We sat at the bar and split three different kinds of rolls, all house specials. The gorilla makis aren't bad. At least they are helped by the zip of the saracha sauce. Something I HATE to see at sushi bars is the advance making of gobs of tuna rolls for quick slicing and service later. Strictly amateur and while it might be good for cranking volume it slaps the freshness imperative right in the face. Worse, in the hour that we sat there the 30 plus pre-made rolls sat on a cafeteria tray on the TOP of the sushi bar. I doubt the health department would be too thrilled about this, to say nothing of the unwitting customers who ate them later."}
{"text":"Let me start with saying that the service was great (3pm on saturday, pretty empty), we were seated immediately and drinks were constantly refilled promptly. Unfortunately the rolls (Philadelphia, spicy tuna) and the salmon nigiri were horribly sub par. The salmon nigiri was a light pink color (it wasn't yellowfin) with almost no marbling and it was rather small for two pieces for 5 dollars. The rolls on the other hand were absolutely tiny! The amount of cream cheese in the phili roll was about twice the size of the salmon. The spicy tuna was tiny as well, both being poorly rolled as well with a ton of overlapping of the rice. All in all, bland and definitely overpriced. Also, for a heavy Asian ambiance, I did not like loud rock music."}
{"text":"This could have been the WORST dining experience I've ever had. First, the hostess gave away my reservation (I'll admit to be 10 minutes late but I called to inform them). We were sat outside, no eating utensils, table not set. We waited 20 minutes before being acknowledged. 10 minutes later the server took a drink order, and our food order. Appetizers came out after 30 minutes ( at this point I was timing) I ask about our drinks and was told the bar was very backed up ( although the restaurant was only 3/4 full). We had no eating utensils or napkins so I took them off of a neighboring table. 15 minutes later drinks came out, no flavor to them. 25 minutes later food started coming out, it wasn't bad (why I gave the restaurant 2 stars). Visitors and locals beware, this restaurant is terrible."}
{"text":"The food is definitely NOT impressive!!  The funny thing is when I first went here 13 years ago, I was very impressed with this place, (of course I was new to sushi and going out so my best friend and I loved this place).  I am now living near San Francisco and have now gone to quite a few sushi places and thus I can tell this place sucks!    I just visited my best friend this weekend in AZ again and we decided to go back here.  First of all we sat at the sushi bar, thinking we'd get faster service.  Instead, we were disguisted by the dirty display glass, showcasing some old, brown and dirty looking sushi pieces.  We ordered the edamame which you can't really go wrong.  The potsticker soup was very tasteless, bland, and a waste of money.  You'd seriously do better boiling your own frozen potstickers with a few veggies.  The Salmon skin hand roll wasn't bad.  I liked the crunch of the salmon skin, the flavor was not bad.  I also ordered the soft shell crab sushi roll.  It was acceptable, but I've had much better.   Ambiance is not bad.  Service was really slow.  Overall, I would not go back.  I wasn't satisfied and yet the bill for lunch was $54!"}
{"text":"I think Ra is great if you want to go to a tready place and have fruity overpriced drinks and sushi. The food isn't bad and neither is the service but it's not worth what you pay for it. Not to mention the last two times I went to Ra I've had issues with paying. The first time was at the Val Vista location, I paid with a card but left a cash tip but when I got home and checked my bank account the waitress had decided to add her own tip to my card. I left her a 20% tip so it wasn't like I had shorted her. I called them and they refunded my money but never apologized and the girl still works there. The second time was the Mill location, they ran my card through twice and didn't tell me so suddenly I check my account and I'm missing over 100 dollars. Again, they refund my money but don't apologize. I have had good experiences there but this lastest thing with them overcharging me has put me off quite a bit."}
{"text":"Yuck!  I took 2 friends to lunch here today. The hostess was no where to be found. No one would even acknowledge that we were there! Finally got seated and the table was set but DIRTY! I asked the waiter to please clean it... He came back 10 min later. The service was terrible. We each ordered sushi on salads. I thought it tasted odd. It took forever to get the bill. We left and decided to never go back. I called my friends about an hour later and asked how they felt... We ALL had intestinal problems!!! this used to be a great spot!  Gross"}
{"text":"I got a good vibe from this place, good variety of music, a little dark, but overall a good theme. We got in at 3 o'clock so the food got to us quickly and was very fresh. The crunchy shrimp tempura roll was delicious as were the spicy sesame chicken wings. Good food, good people, check them out if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of sushi to the point where I'll eat it several nights a week if available and economical. When I was craving it particularly one night, we checked local sushi places and decided to head down to RA on Mill Ave.  One, the decor is modern chic influenced by classic Japanese reds and blacks. We chose to sit at the sushi bar rather than a table. The seats were comfortable and at the correct height for sitting (unlike some places I've been too), but the ambient temperature was a little chill. Not sure if it was because we were seated at the sushi bar however.  Two, our server was pleasant and accomodating. Although after taking our initial order he all but disappeared for the rest of the meal. I was lucky to flag him down for a refill of water and to ask a question. Our sushi server was very pleasant and available, even while working on someone else's food. He told us a little bit about how he got started in sushi preparation and was conversational, but not to the point of interrupting our personal conversation with each other.  Three, food. Good quality. I had tuna nigiri (my favorite) and he had the tina roll; we shared a side of edamame. The edamame was delicious, prepared just right. My nigiri was good quality tuna, but the size of the portion was a tad on the small size - especially for the price. Most places I'd have expected four for the price I paid. My boyfriend's tuna roll seemed a bit on the small side as well. We both ended up needing to order twice, making the meal more expensive than I had anticipated but not unworth it.  Overall my experience was mediocre. While the quality was good, the expense was not. It was wholly memorable but I wouldn't sneer at going back. If I were in the Mill Ave area and wanted sushi, I would go here since I'm familiar with it. If I were just in Tempe and wanted sushi, I'd probably try some place new.  Decent but nothing to write home about at this time."}
{"text":"Fresh  sushi and the best unfiltered saki I've ever had . It's called créme-de-saki. We ordered sushi roll off of the happy hour menu . Spicy yellowtail, edamame, and tuna tetaki  appetizer.  I liked how they added avocado to tuna tetaki. Nice touch. Laid back atmosphere. Great music and ambience . Great for an inexpensive sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"I would highly recomend ordering a sunami punch from the bar.  I really really hate sushi, but coming here for drinks is well worth it.  Most of my friends like the sushi here, but for me the drinks are top notch."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour today (Monday). The restaurant was pretty quiet yet when we walked in there was no hostess to be found. We stood there for what seemed like 10 minutes before the hostess finally appeared and what a negative nancy she was! Our server, a young blond guy, was much nicer and very attentive.   The food was good we had the tootsy maki roll, and 2 salmon  bento boxes. Bento boxes were a little over priced, it was after 3 so they were no longer on special for $8.75 but instead 11. I recommend the baby umami punch drink during happy hour wouldn't pay full price for it but at 6.75 it's not bad. Could be less ice and more drink though!   Overall experience was ok. My bf and I joked that a requirement to work there must be to be bitch-y because wow most these girls sure were! RA do some customer service training with your people and you'll be golden !"}
{"text":"the food is good.  the outside seating is good.  the service was bad.  it took them for ever for everything.  not that we were in a rush but come on get it together."}
{"text":"Went here on a slow Tuesday evening.  Ordered a glass of wine and some appetizer wontons.  Waiting patiently for the wontons while the bartender was attending to her phone texting away.  The bartender finally finished her messages and then raced to the kitchen to grab the wontons.    I had 1 wonton and it was room temperature at best.   When I looked for the bartender, she was back on her phone texting away.  I finally flagged her down and asked for the bill.   When she returned with the bill, I informed her that the wontons were cold.  She told me that she will tell her manager.   I didn't finish the wontons and threw down the wine and left ($20 with meager tip).    The manager did chase me down outside and apologized.    She then handed me a card for a free appetizer ($8 or less).  When I looked at it closer two days later, I saw that the coupon had already expired the next day.   So I tossed it, and have no reason to return."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is amazing here. $3 Bottles of Warm Sake. That's basically all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and poor service. Went in there today for lunch and the server brought me the wrong drink, and it took him 10 minutes to come back to fix it. He brought me the right order, but nobody offered to refill my drinks or even see how the meal was. Finally, when I asked about dessert, he disappeared for another 10 minutes and told me not to bother because it had freezer burn. I won't be back."}
{"text":"If you know what to expect, don't complain.  OK, it's Americanized sushi. But that's like its own type of cuisine now, so get over it. Don't expect a great sashimi creation, just come and order the rolls that sound like the most fun (a Tootsie Roll? no, it's not from Japan. duh.). Come at happy hour and they're pretty cheap.  It's a fun atmosphere, so expect a hip crowd. Waitresses who use their looks to make up for being bad servers. (Who cares?) A young, fun crowd with good drinks and good Americanized sushi.  The Yelp reviews on this place are pretty mixed. I'm guessing it's just the divide between people who knew what to expect on the one hand, and people who expected something different on the other."}
{"text":"Met up here with a big group of friends who had reserved a table the day before. I think there was 12 of us. They sat us in the back corner of restaurant (which was fine by me) because we had space to move around and didn't feel cramped.   I like the sushi here... The rolls we got were just fine in my book so no complaints there. I think we got the Vegas, spicy tuna and the Shrimp tempura rolls. The Server... Ok the server was awesome! She was able to split the bill per couple, bring the food and drinks in a (can't say timely because it's too close to spendy or pricey) So, She was on it is all I have to say!   Good job on that night. They were busy and things went really well. Exceeded my expectations. Good place to start the night if you are going to hang out in old town."}
{"text":"Ra is a great place to go if you're looking for a party-atmosphere to hang out with friends and have some sake. But be warned, if you're in the mood for authentic and fresh sushi and a relaxing atmosphere, this is not the place.  The patio, during the cooler months, is quieter and more enjoyable (and is a decent place to people-watch on weekend nights). They have a great bar if you're looking to socialize and have a few cocktails during happy hour.   The special rolls are good. I love their Ultimate Shrimp Tempura roll and their Ahi Tuna is good. However, the seafood is not as fresh as it could be. The prices are a bit expensive for only receiving decent sushi.   When you're traveling and don't know any local sushi joints, Ra is a reliable chain to go to."}
{"text":"I visited this location over the weekend.The food was pretty good but prices were a little on the higher side. I give it a 3 star!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is the worst Japanese restaurant that we have ever been to. Food was so crappy......it is not Japanese food at all. I don't know what that was, e.g. the coconut shrimp, I couldn't eat shrimp anymore after that........holy crap!"}
{"text":"The sushi is pretty decent at Ra. It's really loud though. It's a better place to go with a group of friends for drinks and sushi rather than a table for two."}
{"text":"A group of four of us had sushi on the patio. It was phenomenal food and priced right! I would highly recommend this restaurant! Surf and Turf roll was excellent."}
{"text":"The rolls are pretty boring, i had the lobster and shrimp roll and the rice is dry. Maybe next time I'll try something else. I usually go for rolls with raw fish, but i just can't right now because i'm pregnant. The bento box lunch special is good though, for $8, you get miso soup, salad, gyoza dumpling, egg roll, rice and your choice of meat. My server Lauryn is attentive and constantly checks on me, which is good. The sushi guys on the sushi counter are friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Ra is the place to be at night. Start out with sushi and stay for the night life. Nick one of the patio bar tenders is a great guy and always make sure your drinks are filled. I have never had poor service in the restaurant or at either of the bars. If you're around Mill Ave. and want to get your sushi on I suggest heading to RA."}
{"text":"I am 42 years old and have spent 20 years in the food service business and I can say without any hesitation that tonight's meal and the service was by far the worst I have ever experienced.Madriana Who claim to be the manager and Miguel Who was our server we're both incompetent, rude and deceptive. In my 42 years I have never not left the tip but tonight was obligated to do so as a statement of my discontent. Not only was the service substandard and it took over two hours to get eight dishes but then, when I saw an up charge of $3.50 for a martini after being charged $10 which was never disclosed on the menu and I question it I was told that that is their policy and they would reluctantly remove the charge because I should have known that. I have never heard of a restaurant charging $3.50 to shake alcohol with ice and add three olives. It was never disclosed and the managers attitude was nothing more then completely rude and intolerant. I have no idea where she learned customer service skills or the goal of customer satisfaction. Like I said before, this was the worst dining experience I and my dining friends have had and I would never ever set foot in this establishment again if that is representative of the management and service that they call common place!!!!  I wish I could give this review zero stars because one star is an overreaching complement for the her Renda's service we received. Not only was the service bad but we were made to feel like we were unreasonable in our desire to get served on time and to understand the policy that was not documented"}
{"text":"On my recent journey back home to Arizona, I ventured to Ra, on busy Mill Avenue in the heart of Tempe.   We arrived just after happy hour, missing the great deals on sushi and sake. The first round of drinks was a sake bomber, made with high-end sake and a cold Chinese beer, which really hit the spot on a dry, hot Phoenix afternoon.  We sat  in the back patio, complete with a full bar, seating for diners and misters to fend off the brutal Arizona sun. We ordered a couple plates of sushi, which was flavorful and tasty.  Although our bill was pretty high  - $100 - this place is worth a visit if you are in the land of the Arizona State Sundevil."}
{"text":"Modern place with nice outside seating. Very good sushi and strong cocktails! Friendly service."}
{"text":"For as busy as it gets with all the college kids, their service is awesome and those girls work their ass off. sometimes things take a while, but its because its busy and great sushi takes time. I love this place. Their servers are fun and so are their bartenders."}
{"text":"Service was nice but its never good leaving a restaurant still hungry.... overall its over priced for the quailty and quanity of food."}
{"text":"Try Viva Las Vegas roll-!its a winner! Great high-quality alternative for those staying at Wynn if you prefer not to pay $30 for a soup. Great service and happy hour until 7"}
{"text":"Great food, Great service, really nice atmosphere! LOVE IT Would definitely come back here, even though its really far from my apartment"}
{"text":"amazing pineapple shrimp salad and avocado roll. very interested in trying out the banana split maki dessert!"}
{"text":"Umm...welp...I love RA, especially the Ahwatukee location, but since I've moved I had to satisfy my craving and this location was the nearest. The place was PACKED. I mean paaaaacked: people creating their own parking spots packed. We were a party of two so quickly were seated. A Plus. Although our waiter was nice, he didn't give us our complete order. No biggie, he didn't charge us for food that wasn't served. I felt rushed however. There constantly was someone at the table asking \"how are things...can I take the plate?\" While there was still food on them. We ordered  a CA roll, spicy tuna and RA'kin shrimp tacos: one thing came out at a time.... Odd. With some significant time between each drop off. I was soooo craving the tacos and was majorily disappointed! The rice shell stuck to our teeth, they were overloaded with guacamole (?) and I felt cheated out of shrimp. The Ahwatukee sites were 1000% better . I guess if I'm ever in town I'll stop by but I won't be visiting the Val Vista location anymore"}
{"text":"I am not impressed with the sushi. It's not that great. I was very disappointed. I don't believe I will ever try it again. I think a Chinese delivery place would make better sushi."}
{"text":"This place was so fun -  like eating at a club. DJ last weekend was awesome, waitress was super cool, food was good.. great Vegas experience.. can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went to Phoenix for my buddy's Rock and Roll Marathon, and on the day we were heading back to LA we decided to grab some sushi since it seemed to be on everyone's mind. Found that there was a RA sushi bar right near the place we were staying at, and so what I thought was going to be a decent sushi place; since we have one back in CA ended up turning into a horrible experience. To be honest the only good thing I remember about this place was the hot waitress and the green tea...lol...I mean the service took forever (which btw it was around 3 pm and no one was in the restaurant), so either we had some beginner sushi chef learning the ropes or they just decided to take there sweet ass time. If it weren't for the eye candy and the green tea I wouldn't be able to give it any stars, but I decided to be nice and at least give them a star for effort. Have fun for whoever decides to try out this place. Never going back that's for sure. =P"}
{"text":"In town for my son's graduation & we were looking for a place to have lunch, close to our hotel. My son & his gf recommended this place, so we walked over to nearby Fashion Show mall.  From the moment you walk in, the fiery red glow of lanterns overhead & the upbeat music pumping throughout this trendy restaurant, will put you in a head-swingin', appetizing mood for some \"RA\"ckin' great food.  Our friendly & attentive server greeted us & quickly took our drink orders. If you're not sure what's good here, no worries, just look for the red dots on the extensive menu indicating customers' favorites.  Most of us got Lunch Special (11am - 3pm) Bento Boxes (served w/ miso soup, uchi no salad, rice, gyoza & a veggie spring roll) -  Shrimp Tempura $8.50 & Chicken Katsu $8.50. I didn't try any of these, but everyone said they really liked it. The Katsu sauce was served with some spicy mustard swirled in it, different, but still good though. Other Bento Boxes on the menu - Veggie Tempura, Chicken Teriyaki, Beef Teriyaki & Salmon Teriyaki ($7.50-8.50).  My son's gf got one of the Lunch Special Bowls (served w/ miso soup) - Bara Chirashi Bowl (poke-style tuna, salmon, hamachi, shrimp, avocado & cucumber with Asian greens on rice) $10. Again, I didn't have this, but she said it was really good. Other bowls on the menu - Spicy Salmon, Spicy Tuna, Beef Teriyaki & Chicken Teriyaki ($8.25-10).  For starters we got the \"RA\"ckin' Shrimp $10.25. This app was totally \"RA\"ckin'! A dozen crispy (fried-chicken style), super-crunchy seasoned large pieces of shrimp served on greens with an amazing creamy ginger-teriyaki dipping sauce. The rest of the app menu looked just as incredible -  Blue Claw Crab Cakes, Lobster Spring Rolls, Crispy Soft Shell Crab & Scallop Dynamite are just some of the dozen+ apps on the menu ($7.25-10.25).  As for my order? C'mon, we're in Vegas, live a little! So I order, from the signature menu , \"Viva Las Vegas Roll\" $13.25. Five unreal-crab (aka imitation-crab) & cream cheese sushi rolls, tempura battered, crispy fried, topped with a spicy tuna & crab mix then crowned with a crispy fried wafer of lotus root, all on a platter drizzled with a sweet soy sauce. The flavors of the cream cheese, spicy tuna-crab mix & sweet sauce, the creamy & crunchy textures, combined with the Vegas style presentation, make this thing - simply \"RA\"mazing!  All of our orders were brought to our table swiftly, team-effort style & my Sapporo (although took a bit longer) made a dramatic entrance, hand delivered by one of the bar staff - awesome.  In the Fashion Show Mall or nearby & looking for a place to eat? Skip the food court & head to this Strip-level restaurant. No question, this will be on our \"must-eat\" for the next trip. There's something for everyone on the menu, including soups, salads, noodles, a full sushi bar & cocktail bar. Prices are decent, food is great, atmosphere is bumpin' & the service is excellent (as it turns out, our server's a North Shore homegirl) Props to our server \"Raina\" & team RA, br-\"RA\"-ah! You rock!"}
{"text":"One of those loud trendy sushi spots. Was craving sushi for the past few weeks and got lost on the way home from the airport so W and I stopped here for a bite. Almost all of the specialty rolls had cream cheese in them. Why is that?  I understand the Philly roll and maybe one other, but seriously 8 out of 10 had cream cheese. Gross!!    The place was okay, but not serious enough about the food for me. I'm all about fun and trendy, but not at the expense of the quality of food. I prob wouldn't go back, maybe just for drinks if I was in the area again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in on a whim when they didn't seem too busy. Our server, Daniel, was awesome! They were a bit understaffed, but he handled serving all his tables with ease and did a great job! If we lived in this part of Arizona, we'd be regulars - and always ask for Daniel!"}
{"text":"Would have been a 2 star rating but we went during happy hour... $1 sakes, $2 beers, and half price selected appetizer and sushi items. Rolls were average and the crab cakes were worse than the ones you'd find at a Hooters. The pork gyozas, however, were pretty good.  There's too many restaurants in Vegas to waste your time with this one."}
{"text":"great happy hour (especially on sundays 8-11) some of the hottest waitresses you'll ever see music is a bit loud sushi is good not great but when you are paying 3$ per roll, you can't really complain.   good specialty rolls."}
{"text":"RA is my place to get Sushi! Prices are reasonable when it comes to food and drinks. Service is awesome!"}
{"text":"Mainly I order platters from this restaurant, but I've eaten here as well.  Ordering is a breeze. Look up the choices online, place a call at least 24 hours ahead, and schedule a time to pick it up.   I don't like going to the bar to pick up my order. The female bartender there ignored me for a group of sweaty, red faced men grouped at the back of the bar and I mean even AFTER they got their drinks. There was no one else there except for me! When she finally addressed me, she was rather stern and to the point. I tipped the person who walked out with my tray directly. Forget the uptight witch behind the counter...  The sushi on the to-go platter seems to be pretty fresh, but don't expect AYCE sushi quality. It's probably been made early in the morning and is somewhat dry and very firm by the time you pick it up.  If you plan on coming here for a date, you might want to re-think it solely based on the fact that its very LOUD. Like Nightclub loud. If you don't mind eating and yelling at your date, then go right ahead, the food is decent enough.   The spicy miso is nasty. I loooove miso soup, but the spicy miso tastes like regular miso soup with Frank's Red Hot splashed in the broth... and that's it. It takes away from the rich, full, flavor of a good miso soup and replaces it with a cheap vinegar-y taste.  Parking can be horrendous if you plan on parking underneath the mall in the parking garage. It took me over an hour to find parking one summer. Other times I've driven straight to the elevator area and walked right in."}
{"text":"Location: The restaurant is directly at the Las Vegas Strip.   Food: Food was ok but nothing special.   Service:  The waiter was friendly and the service was ok."}
{"text":"The food was okay, but the service was terrible and there was almost no one in the restaurant. I went there with my girlfriend and it took 45 minutes to get our food. I will never go there againif it was possible I would give this place a negative score"}
{"text":"Now I am not a sushi fan...mostly. But Ra is fantastic. First went here in Scottsdale and found this one in Vegas. We were seated quickly the waitress was quick to attend our needs. Food as in the Scottsdale location was phenomenal. Their \"viva\" Las Vegas rolls were great and we had some cheese wontons for an appetizer. Very good. It is a bit pricey but I guess you get what you pay for. I mean of you want cheap sushi go grab it from a gas station and reap the rewards."}
{"text":"1st time visit with hubby! Service was great and the happy hour specials were delicious.   The reason I am giving 3 star is that we were told by our server that our adamame beans were \"on the house\" (since this was our 1st visit).... but at the end, we still got charged for it. We didn't want to make a big fuss over $3.50, so we just paid for it.   Also, our order for seared tuna was forgotten and I had to ask our server (which I understand it can happen). Other than that, we really enjoyed our visit and return again :)"}
{"text":"NOW I GET IT!!!! \"RAw SUSHI!\"  Very clever.  I was in Vegas for tamales in December (Yes, just for tamales. Really.) and tried to find Ra for a mid evening snack, but couldn't. Dunno where it went. Anyhow, last time I was there it was good stuff. It's not the best in Vegas, but it was certainly one of the simplest experiences I had there. It isn't worth cabbing to the Luxor for, but once you're there and you've washed down too many three-foot ra-aritas upstairs, come slide some RAw fish down."}
{"text":"The ambience and servers are awesome but other than the avocado roll I wouldn't recommend going for actual sushi. I love sushi and wasn't expecting an amazing sushi experience from a chain but it really disappointed us.   The miso soup was very salty and fishy. The chile yellowtail dish was just -not okay-, tuna roll-okay, yellow tail nagiri-okay, and the vegetarian roll was really really  rough on the tongue from the green rice paper. We didn't order anything more.   It also takes a really really long time to get any sushi rolls. The miso soup and edamame come out quickly but that's all."}
{"text":"Always great service!! We have never really had any bad food experiences here and love the edamame dip! I hate how loud the music is! My husband and I will go here on date nights and we cannot have a conversation so we make it a priority to eat early. One bad experience, we had to wait some time for our rolls to come out so the manager came up and gave us a card for a complimentary roll next time we came in. When I went to use it, the card was expired and the server would not take it. If you give your guests a complimentary anything due to bad service it should never expire."}
{"text":"Wasn't busy at all, we were sat immediately. We weren't seen by our waitress for almost a half an hour. Took almost an hour to finally get our food. The food was amazing. Thank goodness the food was so good because the service was horrible. I couldn't imagine what it's like on a busy day."}
{"text":"The manager don't let me go in side Im 41 years old and he thinks im younger than 21, I think the babies have to train more and have more idea about if have gray hair is older than 21 and id the person have deep  wrinkles is more than 21. I use to love RA but if u are walking around and don't have you I D just don't stop either you are 50 years old."}
{"text":"Came to Ra last week with my sister, and I've been to Ra several times. Over the past few months I have noticed it is definitely not as full as it used to be. The music was up awkwardly loud for a tuesday night, especially given that there wasn't very many people in the place. Anyhow my sister and I sat down and ordered a yellowtail appetizer and a few drinks, and then she ordered a few rolls while I stuck with the sashimi plate that I usually get.   The appetizer was really good, yellowtail in a garlic/soy sauce of sorts with some green onions shaved on top. When my sashimi arrived, I could tell from the smell of the platter that the sashimi was borderline fresh, and after taking a bite of the salmon I informed the waitress that it wasn't really up to par. After conferring with the chefs, the waitress came back to inform me that the fish was fresh and cut this morning, but that she's happy to take it off of the bill since anything else I order will be taken off the same fish. So instead of offering another option, she walks away and leaves me with a bowl of rice.   Needless to say I wound up walking down the street to another restaurant after my sister finished her roll to eat something."}
{"text":"We tried one of the new rolls the Pacific Roll and the Tunacado!  They were really good, nice presentation, great flavor, of course our 8 yr old is branching out from her California Rolls, so I only got a taste.  We also enjoyed the stand by California roll, rainbow, shrimp tempura and spicy tuna, all as good as the last time."}
{"text":"Food: The sushi and cocktail selection are wonderful.  The happy hour is an especially good deal. Rating: Five stars  Service: The service is very good. Rating: Four stars  Atmosphere: The decor and overall atmosphere are great. Rating: Five stars  Location: The location at Fashion Show Mall is convenient.  There are also options for outdoor seating. Rating: Five stars"}
{"text":"Great food, like most RAs, love the Las Vegas roll and surf and turf role but the chairs are super uncomfortable here. Staff was very friendly!"}
{"text":"I think that this place has the worst service!! We were sitting there for at least 15 minutes without water in AZ it was the worst.  They messed up our orders and then forgot some food!  worst ever"}
{"text":"We've tried the one in Tucson, but this one had a bit of a longer wait.  The food was still delicious though and we keep coming back!  I love the sashimi lunch plate."}
{"text":"Came here hungry and was looking forward to great sushi however the service was terrible!!!! We came in waited five minutes for a table for two when there were five open tables available. After speaking to the manager he blames the fact that they are under staffed? In las vegas? on the strip? really cmon! Very terrible customer service!!!!!!!!!!!! I would not reccomend this sushi place while visiting las vegas! Management was terrible"}
{"text":"We really like this place! The food is consistently good and the service is usually great. They made a mistake of messing up their happy hour a while back but they have brought it back for the most part and we love that!  I recommend the shishito peppers and the zonie roll!"}
{"text":"Placed a to go order and the loopy girl taking it royally messed it up. But the manager brought out my correct order really quickly. Additionally, he let me keep the food that she had erroneously given me. Then he offered to refund the entire meal back onto my credit card. Way to go with great customer service!"}
{"text":"RA is the worst place to go for sushi. They are owned by the Benihana corporation... so that should explain everything. RA is the Samauri Sam's for sushi. Test kitchen prepped with a marketing team to sell food based on quirky names for different rolls.  This RA is located in a shopping complex next to a movie theater. They have a decent bar and a great happy hour drink menu. That's about it. Don't eat there. Their fish doesn't taste very fresh and their rolls... well, they come out looking so fancy. But that's it. Just a pretty face.   Prices are a little steep considering they serve 2nd rate sushi. You can find fresher tastier rolls at Safeways."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of RA sushi restaurants in the valley but this specific location (mill) never seems to be the best location. I was eating my lunch when I over heard the manager getting upset at the customer who was sitting across from me because he was unhappy with the rolls that were served to him. During this process I witnessed the MANAGER become almost irate and say the F word towards the customer. They both ended up out front and as I was walking outside the manager was not handling the situation in any calm way he seemed to almost instigate a fight. I will no longer come to this location due to the experience I encountered today."}
{"text":"One star because I can't give zero.  Or maybe a star for the server - after her initial bitchiness i got the feeling that she felt sorry for my hungry ass.  Why?  Because it took about an hour for me to get my food - and when it came it wasn't worth the wait.  Here's the deal - I walked in alone and asked to be seated outside. The restaurant was crowded and the music really loud.   When I sat down a seemingly nice server came over took my drink order (hot green tea) and brought it over pretty quickly.  I had already decided what to have - I'm a creature of habit when it comes to sushi, so I placed the order, sat back and relaxed to enjoy reading my book.  About 15 minutes later, the server comes over to say that the sushi bar is slammed and that it will take 30 more minutes for my food to prepared.  When I communicated to her that I wasn't really happy about this, she told me that she'd understand if I left.  But where am I going?  By the time I get up and walk over to another restaurant, wait for a table and be served, it would take longer so I decide to stay.   What a mistake.  After half an hour comes and goes, I turn around to look inside and THERES NOBODY SITTING AT THE SUSHI BAR!!!  I was pissed!  Why am I waiting???  Apparently there were two large tables that ordered a lot of food, but WTF???  I'm one person who only ordered a few pieces of sushi for gods sake.  I finally say to the girl  - hey - can they at least send me a portion of my order???  So she comes back with half the order and about 10 minutes later the rest.   I take a bite and am gobsmacked to find the rice practically crunchy.  It was actually hard.   So I picked away most of the rice, ate the fish and asked for the check.  A manager came over and offered me a drink coupon for my next visit.  Did she not notice that I was drinking tea?   I told her that I don't live in the area and asked that she take something off the bill - which she did.  But nothing would inspire me to go to this restaurant again.  I mean, really - it's a large place that seats tons of people.  You'd think that they'd be prepared to feed the amount of people who occupy the place in a somewhat timely manner.  While it was crowded, it wasn't like there was a wait out the door and every seat filled.  Talk about poor management.  Find your sushi elsewhere in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"HAPPY HOUR IS THE TITS. I am new to Vegas as a resident, but not as a visitor. So when i asked my friend where is good happy hour at close to where I was driving, he said Ra Sushi at the Fashion Mall. He hit the nail on the head. Drink n food specials are amazing, and taste great. Also the wait staff is friendly as well. The price is great, me and the wifey were able to sit relax and enjoy a few drink's and have dinner in the outdoor seating area. There is also no lack in service, and quality of the food, even for happy hour specials."}
{"text":"This is the spot where all my friends and I go when we hit mill. Good music and feels very swanky. Love the food and ive never really had anything bad here. Drinks are a bit pricey after happy hour but they are mixed well at least. The staff is great too :)"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of this place and try to go every time I visit Vegas.  I think it is the best sushi place in Vegas.  Try the Viva Las Vegas roll, its to die for yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Happy hour process are where it's at! Garlic yellowtail sashimi was delicate and delicious. Pineapple cheese wontons were light and tasty. Steer clear of the spring rolls - basic and fried tasting. Our waiter was awesome and the ambiance doesn't feel anything like Vegas. The patio is a great place to hang out and get away from Vegas for some good food."}
{"text":"I went to this RA location a few weeks ago for my sisters birthday. I had wanted to go for awhile, even though they got a large amount of negative reviews, but they were mostly about the restaurant and the fish quality, which I don't eat anyway so I figured it would be fun to try the vegetarian rolls.   So we went in on a Sunday about 6pm, and there weren't very many people in here, which surprised me. We wanted to sit on the patio but it was full and we didn't feel like waiting the 20 minutes before a spot would open up. So we got a table next to the sushi bar near the back. There was one table full of drunk people behind us that was kind of obnoxious for 6pm, but they left shortly after we arrived so I can't complain too much about the atmosphere. It wasn't crowded, wasn't loud like most people complain about (I don't know if that has anything to do with the day we chose to come in), so far so good.  My sister and I ordered alcoholic beverages, mine was good, but I wish it had more alcohol, and the glass seemed really small. My husband and mom got the green iced tea. My mom liked it, my husband thought it was had a strange powdery flavor.   We go over the menu and decide what we want. My sister, mom and husband chose a selection of fish type rolls, while I decided on the avocado roll, cucumber rolls, and vegetarian rolls. We also got three appetizers. Edamame, which was ok. A little salty for my taste. Pineapple wontons, which everyone said were good. And then we got the tofu appetizer. It was ok. I expected it to be crispier. The appetizers came out in a strange order. Not one of them came together. They all came separately, about 5-7 minutes apart. Which is weird, but wasn't too bad because there was enough food to keep everyone occupied.   So after we finished our appetizers, the rolls came out and started filling up the table. I think we ended up with 8 kinds of rolls. I enjoyed my vegetarian rolls. They may have been simple, but they tasted good. I especially liked the avocado rolls. I love avocado. Everyone else said their fish rolls tasted really good. My husband especially liked the crispy calamari rolls. His eyes like rolled into the back of his head. Lol. But he is easily amused when it comes to food.   We then decided on two of the deserts, desert sushi and banana rolls. They were both pretty good. I have had better deserts, but they weren't horrible.   I think all in all we were there something over an hour and a half and spent about $120. It seems a little steep for what it was. But I would definitely come back for some take out veggie rolls.   This place deserves a solid 3 stars based on my experience. I would rate it a 3.5 if I could. The food was good, the service was not too bad. There were some points in the meal where we wondered where our waitress went off too but she never disappeared for too long. All in all it was a yummy experience."}
{"text":"We came to Vegas for a fun birthday celebration with 23 friends and family. We love sushi and Japanese food and Yelp directed us to RA Sushi Bar. It was perfect! The environment was clean, and very comfortable. The service staff were total professionals and helped us decider the menu. The food was amazing! So delish! The prices were very good as well. Yummy food that didn't break the bank."}
{"text":"Big pokemon go player and like to sit outside and catch while eating Sushi.  Lobster roll is the best."}
{"text":"We were walking around looking for something to eat and stopped here.   Service is super slow so don't stop here if you're in a hurry.    I have celiacs disease so can't have gluten but try to be understanding that my options are limited.   The waiter was so unhelpful.  I asked him if there was a gluten free menu and he said no.   Then he said \"there's a list here somewhere \" but couldn't find it.    All I needed to know it there was anything on the menu that didn't have gluten and he said \" I don't know what to tell you\"  This is not a way to act when you are in a restaurant is Las Vegas, a city based on tourism.    The manager came out to help and didn't know what gluten was.   Even besides this they forgot a soup, switched out one sushi for a different kind, and generally took their time.   Stay away"}
{"text":"So I've been back to Ra a few times now, and while the food is always acceptable, the service has gotten progressively worse each time. Today my co-worker and I actually waited an unbelievable 50 minutes for our food, which - if your waitress stops by, checks in with you, apologizes, lets you know she knows you've been waiting - wouldn't have been nearly so bad. Still extremely annoying, sure, but forgiveable. Not this waitress - we had to call her over for every thing we needed. Serioulsy, not once did she just stop by to check on us. We had to call her over to place our drink order, ask for sugar for our tea, to place our food order, to get the check, everything. So by the time the food came, I had to scarf down my grilled apple teriyaki salmon brick in 5 minutes to make it back to work on time. That's it, Ra - you've lost another customer."}
{"text":"I have previously had some mediocre experiences here before, but my wife likes this place, so I decided to give it another try--again to my disappointment.  Upon sitting down at the sushi bar, we placed our drink and appetizer orders right away with our server.  After about ten minutes, I made eye contact with our server chatting away at the greeter stand.  When she came over, I reminded her that I still had not received my Asahi and Sake and with wide eyes she told me it was 'coming right out' as if she had not forgotten, but that apparently opening a bottle of beer takes ten minutes.  After I finally got my drinks, we placed our sushi order with the sushi chef.  After another fifteen minutes passed, we received our sushi--an order of two rolls and two orders of nigiri.  The timing of the sushi order was fine, but the chef explained that they had run out of octopus, so he would not be able to make one of my nigiri orders.  We still had not received our appetizers--an order of edamame and an order of pot-stickers.  I again made eye contact with our server (again chatting at the greet stand).  When she came over, I asked about our appetizers--she told us that hot food usually takes longer than the sushi to make.  First of all, we're talking edamame and pot-stickers!  Those should take 5 minutes max.  Secondly, we ordered them as 'appetizers'--you know, those things that come 'before' the meal?  Thirdly, we had now waited 25 minutes for them.  I am a restaurant manager and have 20 years of service industry experience.  I cannot handle when servers begin making excuses for the fact that they forgot our order. Mistakes sometimes happen, excuses should not.  In addition, my beer and sake glasses were both dirty, my sushi was poorly executed, the nigiri not fresh, and our green tea ice cream was freezerburnt.  If you have not dined here, please spare yourself the experience I payed for today.  Go to Stingray, Pearl, or Blue Wasabi.  Do not waste your money here.  I certainly never will again."}
{"text":"Happy Hour- super cheap, good deals.  cheap sake, cheap beers, cheap sushi.  The downside- you get what you pay for.  The Sushi is made in the same process as going to a Subway.  Everything is wrapped in plastic wrap and they just plunk the ingredients onto rice.  White sushi chef re-wraps it a few time, \"I think that will stick\", and walla! Sushi!  Would I recommend the sushi?  No.  But I would recommend the sushi if you want cheap eats. Yes. Its' a little better than going to the grocery store for sushi, but not much."}
{"text":"Use to love this place when I came into town! Not sure if they have a new chef or what the deal is but their sushi has dropped significantly in quality. Super disappointed!!! Never coming back."}
{"text":"We were craving sushi and this place was recommended. We had to wait about 30 mins for a table (not bad for a Saturday night), but we grabbed a drink in the bar area. The food was really good, we had the vegetable tempura, and then a couple of their signature rolls. The \"ra\"ckin roll was really good, very different. The other roll had mango in it, on the lighter side, but very good as well. Service was fairly good, waitress was a little slow to fill up waters, but otherwise not bad. We're not from Scottsdale, but we'd probably come here again if we were in the area."}
{"text":"Amanda was very attentive and made a very warm welcome.. Bar was a bit busy and she held her own and still checked up on me in a timely matter.. I'm starting to like this place for its vibe and customer service.. Food is ok but like the service much more better.."}
{"text":"I make it a point to go here every time I fly to Vegas. Awesome sushi,  strong drinks and a great staff. The rest of the sushi restaurants in Las Vegas should stop by with a pen and pad and take notes on how to do sushi right."}
{"text":"Terrible service, not fresh, music so loud on a week night you couldn't have a conversation with the person next to you."}
{"text":"Have been here many times and have never had a complaint. The sushi is consistent, the service is decent and they have a great happy hour- great prices on sushi and drinks."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good, but not outstanding. I'll stop for a quick lunch or a drink when I'm close by."}
{"text":"So my girlfriend and I came here for a special date while visiting Tempe, and in the past I have always had a great experience at RA which is why I often visit the location in Tucson, We were seated in a booth in the back, and as soon as we sat down could smell something HORRIBLE. The only thing I can seriously compare it to was human URINE that maybe someone had an accident in the booth and never cleaned up. I don't know but I was EXTREMELY grossed out. I had to chase down the server who hadn't yet greeted our table and when I told him very nice what had happened, he made me feel like I was in his way and told me to go back to the other side of the restaurant to the hostess stand and have her seat us again(already 20min since we had entered the restaurant at this point)  we explained to her what happened and she brought us back to a table that was directly next to the urine smell, and told her we didn't want to sit in that stinky area. So we finally just had her sit us at the sushi bar, she said she was sorry and was going to let the manager know. The manager then came out to serve us. We ordered right away and the food took forever to come out, I saw one of our rolls sitting on the counter ready for about 5min and he didn't comp anything or offer anything to make the situation feel like they cared at all. At first I thought the manager took us because he wanted to make sure things got better but I think it was more because they thought we were being a difficult table.  One of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had especially after a long day. Please take care of this situation before more people spread the word."}
{"text":"Best darn SUSHI  Place  in VEGAS....If  want to Try Sushi & never had it or DON'T KNOW What to order-just ASK  the Very Friendly Staff for HELP?  It's the Freshest and BEST Seafood in Vegas and at an affordable Price"}
{"text":"The RA Sushi Restaurant, located directly on the Strip, surprised me with very good food and at it's heart a very nice atmosphere. The appetizer I ordered was very delicious Edamame beans in a divine spicy soy sauce with fresh garlic. As a main, I got the Viva Las Vegas Roll, which blew my mind as an explosion of different flavors, and different textures threw all together, creating one hell of a sushi meal. Our server, Britney, was very insightful and empathic, she brought us the food in time and refilled the drinks, always with a smile. The experience was underlined by the loud technopop playing in the separated area where I sat outside. I would definitely recommend this as a place to go out for your next trip to Sin City."}
{"text":"I've gotta give this place 4 stars because not only does their food taste amazing, their servers/bartenders and atmosphere ROCK!  My friends and I frequent Vegas a lot for Spokesmodel work. Every given trip we hit up RA at least once, if not more. And we have been frequenting this spot for over 5 years!  Tracy at the bar is hands down one of the sweetest, most genuine girls I've ever had the pleasure to meet. She is on top of her game as a server and makes a killer sake-tini!   Their happy hour menu has a variety of awesome rolls, salads, gyoza, skewers and a variety of drinks. Everything from classic cocktails, to beer and wine.   This might sound strange, but the veggie roll is out of this world. I am a seafood lover, however I always order at least one veggie roll. I'll be honest the only reason I even stumbled across this roll was when I was eating with a vegetarian friend. She ordered it and when it came out, it just looked too good.   Spicy yellowtail, and salmon are my all time favs.   I don't usually do the fancy rolls however, my husband loves their Vegas roll.   I can't wait for my next trip back! Thanks for always being so awesome RA. My friends and I always look forward to your wonderful food and service!"}
{"text":"Let's begin with, I am reviewing the Ra restaurant in Kierland Commons, not old town.  I have to admit, I was impressed.  But then again, it really only takes good cocktails and fresh sushi to impress me.  Luckily, we were there when there was NO crowd at all.  I would not have been down for the 20 something scene.  But I had an amazing blueberry vodka something, that was great.  The sushi was very fresh.  I think this is one of their better locations."}
{"text":"Stopped here very quickly for some appetizers: shishito peppers and the garlic citrus yellowtail.  Strawberry lemonade for the drink...service was great and the food exceptionally fresh!  I've been here before this time and will continue to return.  Lots to try on the menu!"}
{"text":"So, I ordered the Pineapple Cheese Wontons & the  Pork Gyoza. Let me first say this We this location first opened up I can once or twice a week for over a year at least and the food was great the food has gone down hill, I Went to the location in Ahwatukee last week the food was great so not sure what they're doing at the location in mesa. Because the last few times I been here have been bad"}
{"text":"Came here before a Giants spring training game on the recommendation of our hotel shuttle driver.  The food was very good and the service was excellent. We decided to eat off the happy hour menu since it was early and left full and happy.  We had the gyoza, seared tuna, shrimp tempura roll and edamame. My friend also had a beer and we got out of there from under $30."}
{"text":"I've read a lot of the previous reviews and I don't understand the people who are surprised that Ra does not serve the best quality sushi.  May I remind all my fellow reviewers that this is a CHAIN restaurant who opens restaurants in strip malls in the hippest urban environments.  Do you go to On the Border and remark at the lack of authentic Mexican Food?  No, it's a chain therefore it cannot truly be authentic.  It's a rule.  As far as chains go Ra isn't the worst I have ever been to.  Granted the comments about the consistency of the sushi are true.  I've had both good and bad experiences here.  Overall it is a unique chain that does a decent job selling americanized sushi rolls.  You won't find the most authentic sushi here, but the calamari roll, the Las Vegas roll, and the Gojira roll are worth trying, as long as you aren't expecting \"authentic\" sushi as some of the previous reviewers were."}
{"text":"Ate here last year and had a terribly inattentive, condescending server and the food was just okay.  We asked for them to omit some spicy tuna from one of their specialty rolls and he gave us so much attitude about it we almost left.  I was back in town again this week and gave RA another try for dinner with a group of 5.  First  of all, it is WAY too loud in there.  The music is turned up so high, we had to scream at each other just to have a conversation.  As soon as we sat down, they turned the lights down so low we could not read the menus.  Luckily, we are A/V techs working in town and we all had our flashlights handy.   You would think seeing a table full of flashlights would clue them in to turn the lights up again, but no such luck.  We had already been waiting quite a while when our waitress came and asked us if we would mind waiting some more so she could finish with another table.  When she finally got our table going, our beers were served warm (it was 110 degrees outside) and we had to ask for glasses for them.  When she took the food order, she couldn't hear one end of the table. After shouting back and forth with bad results, we had to suggest she come around to the other end of the table so she could hear us better.  The worst part came when the entire group had been served, except for one of us.  When we inquired about this she said - and this is verbatim - 'If we waited to bring it out until it was all ready, the fish would go bad'.  We also received our appetizer AFTER we had finished our meal, with no apology or explanation.   If the food was amazing I would say putting up with all this was tolerable, but it just isn't.  The servings are skimpy and there is more rice than anything else in most rolls.  Their specialty rolls are not even served with wasabi or ginger.  The failed mexi-japanese fusion menu is more flash than fish.    I sincerely hope the owners and management have more experience expediting a kitchen than our experience indicated, or that the waitress seemed to be aware of.  I've never heard such a ridiculous excuse for guests not being served at the same time.  Never, ever again."}
{"text":"Went in for happy hour after not trying it for several years... HOLY crap what happened to the prices? The sushi was just so so and the prices were high, even on happy hour. We'll be visiting elsewhere for a sushi fix from now on. boo."}
{"text":"rien de special niveau nourriture. il faut pleurer pour avoir le wasabi ET SURTOUT ATTENTE INTERMINABLE. Passez votre chemin ou alors vous avez du temps a perdre"}
{"text":"Sushi is so so, but their Vegas roll is AWESOME. Service can be ridiculously slow on the weekend and the loud music can be a bit of a buzzkill, but the mixed drinks are unique and don't skimp on the booze, so that makes up for a lot. Going in a group can really drag out how long you're there, so I usually just go with one or two other people."}
{"text":"I decided to venture out and try something new. I had heard great things about the RA sushi bar restaurant, so I decided to give it a try. I went with a couple of friends during happy hour which is the best time to go. They have a excellent variety of sushi and drinks on their happy hour menu for great prices. Right away we were greeted with a warm smile by the hostess and seated. The restaurant is located in a wonderful area.  The decoration and set up of the restaurant is so refreshing and classy. Within minutes of being seated our server came to welcome us. She always had a smile on her face and was attentive to our needs.  She had very good knowledge of the menu and was a great help to us.  I had received great quality service from her. We had ordered the Viva Las Vegas Roll, California Rolls, and Tootsy Maki, which are excellent choices for people trying sushi first time. As for dessert, I ordered the banana split maki which is absolutely mouthwatering. I highly recommend this item on the menu. The overall experience I had at the Ra sushi bar was incredible, I most definitely plan on going again. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"The worst service I have never see until this restaurant. I even wouldn't like to give them the point. There is totally no service in the restaurant. I sit inside more than 10 minutes and no one asks me the drinks. Then, I told their manager about this situation. They do nothing even the apology. Never back again."}
{"text":"I must say, i'm very surprised at the overall rating of this location here. First of all, it's on mill, near ASU, so the location itself is prime--star. Secondly, the atmosphere is hip, urban and casual at the same time. another star. Bar--fully stocked, fully staffed, good drinks....another star Now for the food....  I've never raved about Ra...ever. To be honest, when it comes to eating sushi, i have never, ever recommended it to a single person and frankly tell people to stray from it. However, last night i went for happy hour at the mill location (usually go to the one in Ahwatukee) and had great sushi. Everything was fresh, perfectly portioned and just really good! Plus, it was happy hour so the price was even better.  star, star!  The only reason this is only 4 stars, is because i took one away for the layout of the restaurant...the flow is awful lol. thankfully i sat at the bar (full service) so i wasn't subjected to its awkward flow to the fullest.  Even so, I would definitely go back to that location."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here with 7 other friends. All got our food separately within a 30 minute time frame. We didn't get our drinks until after we were half way thru our meals. Never got my drink at all.  My friends like there food though.   Very friendly waiter, seems new though. He was all over the place and the restaurant was not very busy ."}
{"text":"I haven't reviewed anything in years so here we go...  Flawless customer service at the bar during the end of happy hour on a Friday. Isaac and Gaby were beyond amazing and deserve praise for how epic they were this evening. They were friendly, engaging and were just really good people. I had a great experience all around tonight. Give these guys props!!!"}
{"text":"To be honest, the food was nothing special. The tempura was greasy and soggy, the ribs and wings were flavorless, and the sushi rolls looked and almost tasted like the frozen type that you can buy at lower-end grocery stores. What this place did have going for it was that it has an awesome Happy Hour. For a group of five guys, we got plastered on sake bombs and full on appetizers for around $30 each. If that's what you are after, this place is great. If you are actually wanting to have a decent meal, your money could be spent better somewhere else."}
{"text":"Hadn't been to the Old Town location in years, mostly because of poor experiences at old Kierland location but glad I did.  Stopped in on a Sunday to pick up take out.  The new bartender from Mass was extremely friendly and personable & gave great service while I had a glass of wine and waited for my order.  The sushi itself was great - salmon nigiri & crispy spicy tuna were fresh & enjoyable.  Definitely will return - pleasantly surprised with both food & service."}
{"text":"quality of food here is not as good as Irvine location. Happy hour is a deal but some of sushi we ordered wasn't fresh and was basically all rice."}
{"text":"Do not eat here if you value your civil liberty, or wish to have a meal where sensible decision making takes place.  Went for the Happy Hour and ordered a nice assortment of food and some drinks.  The waiter then asks me and my wife to provide him with identification.  I ask why I need to identify myself to dine here, and he states that it is restaurant policy of identify every person who orders alcohol.  Now I am over 50 and maybe could pass for 45 on a good day, but surely could not be misunderstood to be a 20 year old.  My wife is a bit younger, but also not looking within a decade and a half of a 20 year old.   So, this business cannot make a decision that happens around 5 million times a day elsewhere across America, where someone makes a sensible decision on whether someone is old enough to legally have a drink.  You know, if you choose to be absolutely silly, then I will just take my money elsewhere.  Ended up going to Osaka on Sahara for a wonderful dinner served by Chef Kenji.  Lovely food, and this restaurant does not want to me to identify myself to enjoy their wonderful selection of food and alcohol.  I urge others to try it.   Dear owner of this restaurant....your silly policy does have consequences, and hopefully other Yelp users who value their liberty, or just don't want to give in to your asinine ID policies will take their money and spend it elsewhere"}
{"text":"I typically have 5 star dine in service but I probably will not order take out from this place again. I order the chirashi bowl and it seems like I get less fish when I order take out. This last time it seemed like it was 90% rice 10% fish.  Would recommend dine in, but if your looking for take out then you might find better value elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love going here...usually!  Yesterday was an exception.  I loved the Las Vegas rolls and that is what my 2 stars are for but the overall experience was not the best.  Our food took ages to come.  All three miso soups were cold.  We sent them back...one item was missing from our bento box ...our beer for sake was warm...we had to ask for ginger and soy sauce...not good service at all...and they weren't even busy.  Lunch for the three of us was $105 and it was painful parting with that much for a sub-standard  and very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"If you want sushi, I'm sure the AJ's Market in the same complex will sell you prepackaged sushi at higher quality / low cost.  The good:  At least happy hour prices minimized the wallet-damage  The bad: Slow service.  The ugly:  Was the tuna frozen or something?  See my other review(s) for Japanese food recs in PHX and LA"}
{"text":"Really fresh sushi right on the strip.   Ra was easy to find in the fashion show mall. We dined outside in the desert breezes while sampling quite a variety from the reverse happy hour menu. The Las Vegas roll was a delight. So big you had to bite it but handling was easy and the texture was perfect. Don't miss the garlic sesame sauce edemame. The sauce is amazing!  Even dipped sticky rice balls in it. Yum!  Service was great, price was right, only negative at all was the music. Bar next door and across the street were all audible and quite distracting in the outdoor patio. This would not be a problem inside. Lots of intimate boths in there."}
{"text":"I love coming to RA when I'm in Vegas because of the happy hour specials! I highly recommend the viva Las Vegas roll and the deep fried ice cream desert"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss for me.  Good location, great looking women working there but food is never outstanding.  But if you want to have fun and be seen then this a place to go."}
{"text":"I haven't been into RA in a while, but I was pleasantly surprised this time. They have upped their game with a new foods, happy hour and drinks! We had the pineapple wontons, which I just love. I love that nigiri is on the happy hour menu- most places don't offer this. We also had a rainbow roll, which tasted fresh and was pretty good. We also had the gojira roll- I really enjoyed this also! Service was great too! We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I have dined here with friends and we all agree that we like the Sushi here. They have really great Happy Hour deals here and the people-watching on the patio makes it even more interesting. The sushi is fast, fresh, and delectable! No complaints here!!!"}
{"text":"I planned a birthday happy hour lunch with friends and decided why not Ra for their decent happy hour.  I should have known better than to go to Ra even after reading the Yelp reviews, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Service for drinks were pretty good but for food, below average.  Majority of my friends all received their food in a decent time span except myself the birthday girl and a friend.  His sushi took over 45 minutes even when others at the same table ordered the exact same item. The waitress did admit to forgetting his order which her honesty was appreciated. There was one roll I never received and just told the waitress not to bring it. The sushi was overall good at a decent price along with the drinks. Service not so much especially when there is no sense of urgency to having food brought to a customer. The last thing I want to see with a hungry stomach is wait staff just hanging around the restaurant.  I'm hoping I caught a bad day and maybe I'll Ra out again in the future. Till then, spend your thirsty dollars elsewhere."}
{"text":"It was pretty empty when I was there so the service was good and fast enough. I will say the sushi was really good with a good mix of traditional sushi and rolls along with fun specialty rolls. I am going back again tonight for dinner. It has been my favorite spot on my business trip."}
{"text":"Over all was a BAD SERVICE!!. I will never go back to this place again. First of they took forever to come and get my order, so I finally ordered- the server deliver my food and only to find out my other food was not available after waiting for a long time. Why did she not ask me if I wanted to pick another one from the menu. She never came back to ask me if everything's ok and not even refill my water. So finally Im done eating they gave me the check again Im sitting there forever just waiting for my server to get my check I tried to get the other server attention but they keep ignoring me. The place was not busy and theres a lot of employees standing around but refuse to make eye contact with me because its not theyre table and my server I can see her from my table she was just hanging in the back by the register. So I have to stand up and approach a server which try to pretend he cant see me so I have to come to him right in his face so I can pay my check. It was such an awful experience that I will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I have been here several times for happy hour and I have never been disappointed. Prime location on Las Vegas Blvd, great food & drinks and awesome people watching.  The calamari tempura is my favorite thing on the happy hour menu. Had the spicy tuna, tempura shrimp, rainbow, and  viva las vegas rolls on this visit and they were all good.  Tried the cheese & pineapple wontons also and they were very yummy. All washed down with $2 sake, you can't go wrong!  The decor is great and nice bar area and outdoor seating. The music is probably a little loud for a nice dinner environment but they play such great music it doesn't bother me at all!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a few different RA Sushi locations in AZ and was so happy to see that I had one so close by home.  My daughter and I eat sushi at least once a week and we've found some great sushi places in the las vegas area...........this is NOT one of them.  Our meal was way over priced and I have to say probably some of the worst sushi I've had in awhile.  The service was terrible and I won't go back here.   I knew the prices were high in advance because I have been to RA and had a great time and a great meal but I won't go back to this location based on the food/service we received at this location."}
{"text":"Sushi are small, they sliced the fish so thin has no sushi taste.  Too much fake crab meat in it and music is too loud.  Feel nasty after eaten.  Won't eat again."}
{"text":"I second the comments about a strong trendy vibe, with a letdown on quality. I expected more from desert sushi."}
{"text":"I used to go to this place at least once a week and all the time I went there I got poor service. One day I decided to talk to David, the manager, who was really rude and told me he thinks he has a good service. Another day I called asking for to go food and they said the food would be ready in 15 minutes, that's what took me from my house till there. When I arrived there the bartender informed me the food was almost ready, I waited more 20 minutes for my food. If I wanted to wait I would not had called in advance. RA really needs to improve their service, nobody works happy there and the quality of service is a shame."}
{"text":"Totally redid their menu and now the prices really are outrageous. Decent sushi that used to be worth it during happy hour until they raised their prices. I tried using a coupon the last time I went and the waitress overcharged me by $18 saying it was just how the computer system worked with the coupons. She took 10 minutes to \"fix\" it, and still overcharged me by $14 and some change. Not impressed. If the coupons aren't going to work with your system, then don't send them out."}
{"text":"100% dissatisfied. We made reservations at 7:30.  Right off the bat we weren't being tended to and had to ask the waitress on many occasions to serve us. We ordered around 7:45. We had a party of six and ordered 8 different sushi rolls. The first plate came out around 8:30 (45 minute wait for ONE platter of 8 rolls). And instead of the rest coming out at one time, they brought them out one by one, 5-10 minutes spaced out from each other. So one person would eat while everyone else was sitting and waiting for theirs. We finally got our last plate at 9:00. One hour and fifteen minutes after we had ordered. The manager came out and gave a very insincere apology. It was EXTREMELY over priced and the sushi was nothing to get excited about. If you like waiting, wasting unnecessary money and eating average sushi then eat at RA, otherwise I would suggest to find a better place."}
{"text":"I have been twice, both at lunchtime. Cute (trendy) place, sushi rolls are decent, not spectacular. Loved sitting out on the patio; however, there was a distinct smell of sewage wafting by every once in a while. Not sure where that was coming from.   The hostesses were unfriendly. Waitresses were nice enough, but wow, S L O W service.  I mean, my God. I had nearly polished of a bottle of sake by the time the food got there (which may account for my belief that the sushi was good, lol!). Same embarrassingly slow service in getting our check to leave.  Overpriced for a lunch menu, I thought, and the calamari appetizer was a huge disappointment. It was like ... TGI Fridays or something. Just very ... sportsbar-esque. Huge, rectangular chunks of calamari, heavily battered and deep fried. What happened to light tempura and calamari rings? Isn't this a Japanese restaurant?  All in all, it was okay. I was in good company both times, and had plenty of time to spend, so the slow service was not an issue, but it could be a problem if you have other plans. I will likely go back until I am able to find a comparable or better sushi place - I'm new to Arizona."}
{"text":"I went here to grab some drinks before heading to Scotssdale for the night. Usually when you think of grabbing drinks some place before you go to get drinks some other place, you picture going to a dive bar or doing shots in someone's kitchen. Everywhere on Mill is so classy and pretty upscale for a college town.  The atmosphere at RA was like walking into a well-decorated, posh, cave. They had the Olympics playing, the wait staff was friendly, it was nice and cool inside (hence the cave comment) and their reverse happy hour wasn't bad either. I didn't order any food but someone I was with did and they brought it out on a huge plate so he was very satisfied. The wait was a little long but our waitress came to reassure us it was on its way. I'd go back here on a date."}
{"text":"Ra was one of the first places I visited during my first stay in the lovely Las Vegas and also made a great comeback my second time around. The atmosphere is hip and trendy, along with the place as a whole. Ra introduces a new spin to sushi- not only in the actual food but also in things like the naming of the dishes. It's fun place to enjoy the night.... not to mention hot waitresses. w00t."}
{"text":"I have gone here several times and every time I go the food itself is decent but there customer service sucks!!! Girl wait staff is rude and obviously lazy... I never get my entire order.....EVER!!!! Ill get my food Togo and I always have to drive back to pick something up that they didn't give me. It wouldn't bother me if it only happened a couple times but jeez every time???? Place is clean though and I do love they're happy hour."}
{"text":"Awesome & best sushi place! Our favo is viva las Vegas roll, kaizen saviche in non veg; veg tempura in starter, veg tempura roll in veg-sushi!!! New cherry Bellini rocks too ! We tried sake, pinapple appetizer last time, which was ok, not as great as ones written above. Overall fabulous food, drinks, and amazing service."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dirty and messy with food all over the floor. The staff was lazy. Why is the the music so loud!?.. Left, went somewhere else.."}
{"text":"First off I just want to make sure that its known that my server was great, and all of the front of house people I interacted with were extremely friendly.   However, I ate here on Sunday and ordered the teriyaki chicken. Now I completely understand this is a sushi place and its probably expected that people just eat that, but I don't like sushi at all and I was only there because my roommate wanted to go there. Anyways, my teriyaki comes out and the first few bites are amazing. But after the 3rd or 4th piece I started noticing the chicken was sort of resisting -- kind of like it does when its undercooked. I cook chicken all the time and I know when its undercooked, but I chalked it off to just being in my head and tried to power through it. Big mistake though, about 16 hours later I started vomiting uncontrollably and after seeing a doctor it was pointed out that I contracted salmonella poisoning. Its been one of the worst sicknesses I've ever received from a restaurant (with the only other place I've gotten sick before was jack in the box).  With that said, if you love sushi like most of america go ahead and eat here. But do NOT order the chicken."}
{"text":"this place was horrible. so bad i never even gotten my food. i called and order their poke and the estimated time was about 40 min. so i got there about 30 minutes after and there was no hostess so i took a seat and just wait until one appear. i finally got a hold of the waitress and she said they were busy and it would take about another 30 minute for me to get my order. she must think i'm blind since it was week night and it was pretty empty in the restaurant, i was too tired from work to argue my point so i told her fine i'll wait. Then after 30 minute pass she came and told me that they are all out and isn't serving it that night. i was like are you freakin kidding me. wasted over an hour just to wait around. horrible. i'm never going back to this location. seriously made me wait around til it's almost closing just to tell me i'm not getting my food. i've been to another RA location and the food was great, but with the service and BS i got here it make me never want to step foot in another RA restaurant."}
{"text":"RA's Happy Hour is the best thing about the sushi restaurant... Their Vegas Roll is to die for, but their non-happy hour prices are very expensive. This is not the greatest sushi restaurant in Vegas, but not bad for the Strip. The decor is nice and their service can really be hit or miss."}
{"text":"Great food, good deals, amazing atmosphere, highly recommend. Caitlin & Chris Twilley have amazing customer service etiquette. Enough said!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Somewhat tucked away at the end of the strip."}
{"text":"Was caving sushi on the last night of my Vegas weekend. Me and my girlfriend weren't looking to break the bank to fill our cravings. Got on Yelp and found this cool spot. The Sunday menu is very well priced because there are about 20 items that are half off only on Sundays. Got plenty of sushi for a very reasonable price. The fish was extremely fresh and just melted in your mouth.   The downsides though;  The restaurant, like most of Vegas, had a sort of club like feel to it where as the music was very loud for such a small place. Also, the service is a little slow, it seemed like they were understaffed the night I went. The food is worth the wait if you can get past the club like beats playing throughout the dining room."}
{"text":"Good service, good price, good food, and sexy waitresses. Safe to say ill be back."}
{"text":"I came into the restaurant a few days ago and I was served by a girl named Katie. She had long, black hair and she seemed to hate me. Idk what I did to her but she would scream at me whenever I would try and order anything. One time she bent down to pick up a menu and I saw her ENTIRE asscrack! Talk about bad service. The only reason I would ever come back is because of the sweet blonde hostess girl. Mad props to her."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. !!! Waited almost an hour for our food during lunch with 7 other tables in restaurant. Not quite sure why but as a GM of another restaurant i would be embarrassed"}
{"text":"This place is extremely loud and filled with 18-25 year olds. The waitresses here pretty much ignore you the entire time, and the sushi was unfortunately sub-par. I'll probably hit up another sushi place next time. On the plus side, the decor was nice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend told me that the sushi we had was the best he has ever had there and that we must have hit it on an ON night. We had the avocado suhsi and that INCREDIBLE... the california rolls were just so so. The people there were the most ridiculous part and made me feel as though we should have been heading to a frat party after our \"date\"."}
{"text":"Isaac is the fucking man. One of the best bar tenders around. I'll be back for sure because of him"}
{"text":"2-star for their wonderful food. Dont get me wrong, their sushi is fantastic. Really authentic!But their service is horrible.  I sat there for 5 minutes and no one came to me. It took 4 people to help me order a bottle of sake. The waitress who supposed to serve me brought me a bottle of water 10 minutes later and didn't show up the rest of the time until I asked her for the check.  Another mid age white guy later on sat 2 seats away from me. The waitress showed up immediately and served him really well. Seriously? Even I'm a young single Asian female, but it doesn't mean I will tip you bad. It's actually fine that the response speed is not fast if the restaurant is busy. But it's not."}
{"text":"My wife Bridgette and I love this place. Best Happy Hour for sushi in Vegas. Phenomenal service and great quality sushi. Very reasonable prices. Tracy is a great bartender. Been coming here to see her for happy hour for the past 5 years. That says something in itself."}
{"text":"Food is barely average and going down hill fast. Service is not great but they try. But they might think of asking the waitress to shower once in a while. Gross."}
{"text":"So just ate at Raw sushi for the first time with my new bf.  Everything was great, no complaints, except for the service. The server was overly attentive to the point of annoying. Every three minutes or so he popped up. It made it difficult to maintain the flow of our conversation. I felt rushed through my meal and dining experience. We were one of three couples in the entire restaurant on a Sunday afternoon.  In my opinion, being an overly attentive server is just as bad as being an under attentive one. If only these people can find a happy medium."}
{"text":"It's pretty simple how I came about to dining at RA in Las Vegas! My boyfriend & I in August 2011 came across the fashion mall near wynn hotel! The place looked inviting... plus I LOVE sushi & we both were starving! When entering you get a welcoming invite & a menu full of delicious items. We ordered the tropical roll, Uni nigri, short ribs, plus more...I can say when we make a trip back to Vegas, we will be coming back to enjoy a meal!"}
{"text":"Had the California Roll and Lobster Shrimp Roll. Both were good and I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I use to love the place. However the past few times I've been the sushi just hasn't been normal quality or flavor. They do have a good happy hour. Cool place to stop and grab a drink with and enjoy the atmosphere. I hope they get better."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and ordered two appetizers and two poke bowls everything was very good expat one appetizer the Shishito peppers. Overall good place to eat"}
{"text":"Awesome place to chill out. Lots of eye candy!  Highly recommend you sit outside and dine with the locals. You can also smoke outside. Good sushi (not great). Great ambiance thought. This North Scottsdale location is much better than the downtown location."}
{"text":"The quality of the food is what earned it zero stars in my book. Go to a real sushi place that's not a franchise this is the McDonald's of Sushi"}
{"text":"Had dinner last night at Ra in Scottsdale and was very pleased. Good service, decent drink specials during happy hour, and great sushi!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan. Grad night here in Tempe and Miguel the manager backed up his inexperienced waitress in serving my husband after a night of celebrating his MSIM degree grad night. I'm more intoxicated than he is by volume percentage ratio... Therefore I believe it was an action of discrimination."}
{"text":"We were craving something light and decided to try this place.  I love a good sushi and sashimi plate, and there were plenty of items on the menu to pick from.  We decided to do some of the small share plates and were not dissappointed.  We ordered a total of 6 items, and all were very fresh and tasty.  The sauces we tried were outstanding.  The service was extremely good....very friendly, efficient and sincere.  Definitely would eat here again...."}
{"text":"Will never be going back to RA on Mill Ave.  Came here this last Saturday night with a couple friends and had the worst experience ever.  I ordered the lobster spring rolls as I was not that hungry.  After over an hour and a couple drinks I NEVER EVEN GOT MY FOOD.  No manager came to apologize for the service but they sent out the cook to say he was the only one working and is really backed up.  Why would they send the cook out to talk to us when he was so backed up?  Worst part is after NEVER getting the food I ordered when getting my check they CHARGED me for the food I never received!  After pointing this out to the waitress she took the food off my menu but still did charge me for the one drink I had.   Still dont know where any of the managers where during this.  This is also my first yelp review as I dont like to bash resteraunts but this experience deserved it."}
{"text":"This was 2-star Americanized/Fusionized Japanese food. It is not authentic. Japanese cuisine connisseurs and purists be warned. This restaraunt fills a niche for businesspeople &amp;amp; hipsters with undeveloped palates who obviously don't know any better.  The nabeyaki udon broth tasted like watery soy sauce (no dashi stock used in the soup broth). Awful. The rolls were bathing in a sickly sweet candy sauce reminiscent of salad dressing that overpowered all other flavors.  Like most things in Vegas, this meal was fake. However, if you are there for the racous environment and drinks, you might enjoy the atmosphere and very friendly service (for which I gave a second star). Our server was wonderful. The lounge atmosphere is very fun and cool. I wanted to feel the same way about the food... but meh, I've had way better sushi, even in Nevada."}
{"text":"Was here on X-mas eve and sat outside on the patio looking on to the strip. Great people watching, stellar food and drinks for a crazy good deal, if you are there during happy hour. Citrus garlic yellowtail and salmon carpaccio were standouts. Would love to come back and try some more food."}
{"text":"I love this place, the best service out of any RA I've been to in the valley and the food and drinks are always good!"}
{"text":"If you are going to go here, know this is a biased review. I am reviewing their LAS VEGAS ROLL during happy hour. The only reason I go, I've never tried anything else, and I never pay full price (half off during happy hour) best deal ever. I can never finish more than a roll, making my meal very cheap. I have never had anything else like it. If you are going to stop in, you better not leave without the Las Vegas Roll. YUM!"}
{"text":"I met a friend for dinner here last weekend and the likelihood of me returning is slim to none. For starters, everything on the menu is overpriced- $4 for a miso soup (that tasted like water from the Dead Sea)? I thought this was a sushi restaurant. The similarly priced edamame and pork potstickers which tasted and had the texture of being previously frozen and microwaved (nuked). The handrolls were likewise underwhelming and even in the dim light of the outside terrace/bar area had the appearance of having been just dipped in red dye 40. The 'special roll' that I had the unfortunate opportunity to try was the last piece of the trifecta that sad night. The inside of the roll had so much cream cheese mixed into what I think was fake crabmeat(?). To add insult to injury, the pieces of sashimi that were used to top the piece de la resistance were so thin that I could through them.   On the other hand, the waitstaff were pleasant and there was no wait/ lots and lots of empty tables!"}
{"text":"Okay, I thought AJ's fine foods was a rip-off for sushi, but NO SIR! I forked over $13 for a rainbow roll to go at this place! (This was a to-go order) When they gave me my cash back, they did not even give me my left over change! I though 'For a freakin $13, this better be a good roll!' NOPE! It was the skimpiest roll I've ever seen! Was in a hurry, took off and ate it. Wasn't a good roll and the 'crab mix' was just smothered in lemon juice! It just tasted like lemon! Later I knew why, I GOT MEDUIM-MILD FOOD POISONING FROM THIS!! I've eaten around a few hundred rolls since I was a kid and this is the first food poisoning I've ever had!   RIP OFF, SKIMPY AND LOW-QUALITY SUSHI, FOOD POISONING, what should this tell you?"}
{"text":"The only reason I am not giving this place five stars is because the service could of been better and I know there are a lot more upscale sushi joints in Vegas, but this place was EXCELLENT! My buddies and I didn't care about going out for an expensive sushi dinner but our hotel concierge recommended that we go to RA for the value. It was a good recommendation because the food was awesome and more than half the things we ordered ended up being discounted because of happy hour to our surprise."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and pretty casual, service was fast, but it took some time for the food to come.Came here for lunch around 3, not crowded at all, plenty of space, really great for outings with friends! Ordered \"Holy Shishito Chicken\" and \"Chicken Katsu Bento\". Both of which were very tasty! The shishito chicken being spicy chicken pieces with peppers, bell peppers, and onions, good to share with a friend. The Bento box came with a salad and miso soup, in the bento itself was more salad, katsu chicken with dipping sauce, rice, eggroll and cream cheese dumpling. I completely recommend these two dishes! Other then that, there is good selection from the menu and drinks as well ;)"}
{"text":"Where are the managers????   It took 1 1/2 hours for our meal to come out at 8:15 in the evening.  Items came out at different times so we couldn't all eat at the same time.  The asparagus tempura was inedible because they didn't cut the ends.  Waitress just took it away and did not comp us.  Waitress knew next to nothing about the sushi menu.  She sat and talked with the hostess the entire time instead of waiting on her tables.  Food was WAY over priced, and I couldn't speak to my dinner companions because the music was way to loud.  One of the worst dining experiences in a long time.  Paid $70 for a dinner for 4 and went home hungry.  HORRIBLE!"}
{"text":"My sister and I just love to eat at RA in Las Vegas and watch the tourist walk by the restaurant. The standard sushi is great, but their original sushis are even better. Sushi tacos anyone. Their happy hour is worth going to!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good but the waiter spilt a glass of water on top of my friend's head :( to make up for it they gave us expired coupons. The waiter and manager kept trying to make jokes the rest of the night, however, they didn't take what they did seriously enough because obviously my friend was very upset."}
{"text":"Ra is the best! Great sushi! Fancy environment And great service! Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for happy hour, however the service is next to NEVER up to par at the bar. Counting now, there are 4 other patrons here, both in pairs, and the time it takes to get a beer, the check, or have them pick it up, is unreasonable. The bartender on duty lacks a sense of urgency between taking and fulfilling orders and even when I was able to establish eye contact, she quickly looked away. Hey Ra, are you hiring bartenders with experience and excellent customer service skills? I know a gal."}
{"text":"Overall food was great however the service was poor. Ordered food never received. Sad...  Won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"Matt Rime was excellent server and we look forward to returning to RA and enjoying Sushi.  It's hard to find anywhere that has servers who give equally good care to the children as the adults.  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! sushi is great and sake bomber is awesome! Happy hour is the best!! service is great too...Try it out during happy hour its worth it!"}
{"text":"My g/f love sushi! She made me a connosiuer of it. and I have to be critical. So many college kids \"love\" RA, but it's mediocre at best.  I'll just list a few things that irk me: I went during a happy hour with co-workers. It was PACKED. Good thing, right? WRONG! Extremely poor service. when I went in to meet coworkers who already had a table the hostess told me I have to wait. When I said I have a table, she got in my face. I was tired, long-day and I wanted to chill. I walked past her, found my friends, and she left me alone. The waitress took quite a bit of time to get around to my table, and the sushi servings were OBVIOUSLY LOW! I went to Zen 32, and now my choice is SakeBomber. their happy hour servings are much more than RA, and their prices are BETTER!  Be ready for loud noises, as every one is trying to talk louder than the music, and the person next to them.  Just an overall poor experience. and I tip on service.   Food quality was so-so. Just don't go during a happy hour, which is the only time it's worth it because it's priced so high."}
{"text":"Delicious rolls! Kind of dark inside, but very nice. Service was fantastic and prompt, which was great. It's a nice place close to campus to grab some rolls, although a lot of them are far from your conventional rolls. Their pineapple wontons are just heaven in your mouth. Prices are average and portions are perfect."}
{"text":"Love the SHRIMP TEMPURA! It takes about 4 orders to get me full! Love it with spicy soy sauce and the ginger served with it. Loved going there for lunch happy hour and great coupons they had woth the businesses within the plaza! :) unfurtnately i dont work close by i still come and get my reg sushi! Nice quite calm atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was in the Phoenix area for a few days, and wanted to find something that wasn't just one variation or another on Southwest/TexMex/NewMex/MexiMex cuisine. Although initially pointed towards a nearby steakhouse, the spring training-inflated clientele proved daunting, and as my two colleagues and I all had a need to feed, the shorter wait time at Ra proved compelling. It was a happenstance not to be regretted. I was particularly pleased with a kiwi/scallop dish that had that perfect blend of piquance and meaty scallop flavor, while another at our table polished off the salmon skin with obvious relish. I'm blanking on the roll I had, but it promised spicy and delivered on it. The mixed drink selections were inventive and tasty, and the waiter we had proved quite cooperative in helping make sure I wasn't served any gluten stealthily (as it might be with the soy sauce or on unagi, for example). The only downside to the experience was the overly load speaker planted over our table outside, which along with the competing noise from the street traffic made conversation difficult. Still, this seems very much a see-and-be-seen place, and perhaps conversation is overrated for most of Ra's patrons. Regardless, they'll be eating well, and I know where to go for sushi the next time March rolls around and I find myself in town to catch some spring training baseball."}
{"text":"I had great service from a waitress. Wish I had gotten her name to give her props, but she was very attentive! Sushi is above average, but so are the prices.  Even their happy hour pricing is on the high side."}
{"text":"Sushi here was good and they have a large selection of roll types. The lobster spring rolls are delicious!! I always like shrimp tempura rolls and theirs didn't disappoint. The tropical roll was delicious and didn't have a strong shrimp taste, but let the fruit shine. The ra-lollipop roll has a delicious, soft, and gooey texture to the fish which nicely counter acts the crunchy shell. Overall, this is a good stop while walking about downtown Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Good service and good sushi! My parents and I come here every weekend for happy hour and never really had a complaint. The one thing I don't like is that the music is SO loud I have to yell my order to the server!"}
{"text":"Love Sushi so usually try new places everywhere. Ive been here a few times and always have a good experience. Love their happy hour menu, has a wide variety of optionsand is very reasonable. The drinks are also good. We did chose a ton of things off the happy hour menu and split so we can all try. I think it worked out great for us and was nice to get to try everything. The Red Sojo Sangria ( I think that's what its called) was good. Our service is usually better but this last time we were slightly overlooked as it took our server forever to get to our table, we received our alcoholic drinks after all our food was out and our server didn't seem to have a sense of urgency. However, our food runner was exceptionally great and super attentive so that made  up for everything else and I still plan on coming back. Overall I really like this place and sitting on the patio is always nice when there is a breeze out. So far haven't been to a better sushi place in LV."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi restaurant. I go all the time in LA and definitely stop by for Happy Hour in Vegas. Its on the strip, has amazing drinks and is great for groups.   We just went this weekend for a birthday and had so much food from the happy hour menu. We had no wait at all and the service was great.   Cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Always have a great time here. The drinks and food are good. Everything we've ordered has been tasty. The staff has always been friendly and attentive. The place is clean, comfy, and inviting. The prices are reasonable for the area. We will continue to return when in Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a good place to come to during happy hour. The happy hour menu for food is 7 dollars or less. You can also get hot sake for 2 dollars and a bottle of Kirin for either 7 or 8 dollars. The food is of good quality for the amount that you pay. The restaurant has a red hue lighting to it, which makes it look nice, but it can be a little hard to see your food at times. Other than that the waitress was really nice and helped us in making our orders, and we didn't have to wait too long for the food. The location of the restaurant allows you go shopping before or after you eat, which is really convenient."}
{"text":"Great happy hour on the strip! Good service.  Watch people walking the strip as you eat good sushi that compares to any of the fancy restaurant that would charge three times more.  Best find on the strip!"}
{"text":"I eat in Old Town often because my office is in the area. This is usually a fast place. The atmosphere isn't too stuffy and usually entertaining. Sushi is mediocre, I've been to other  Ra establishments in the valley and this location is probably the dirtiest. The bar staff keeps our glasses full and they are fun to talk to...I dont know a ton about the  sushi industry but I know that the restaurant needs to be clean for the food to even look good lol! Oh, and I thought fresh wasabi was available at all Ra locations? I was so disappointed to know it wasn't available at this one."}
{"text":"Spicy poke bowl was not that great !!! Very mushy and slimy !! It's supposed to be spicy salmon it is not spicy at all !!!! Overrall there sushi is good . I've had better sushi/poke bowls!!"}
{"text":"Once again I come to RA!!!!! I waited 20min for someone to just talk to me! This place needs to step up!! It's not worth the time for over price sushi!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like the Ra! The server was attentive, and the manager and another woman also checked in on us. Nice to be well cared for! Love the decor, also!  I had the pineapple chicken bowl for lunch, and it was great! Convenient location on the Strip."}
{"text":"Thought the happy hour prices were good and the location easy to get to on the strip but... The sake bottle had a nasty old lemon in it, leftover from when ever someone else had shoved it in there AND the sushi roll we got had a big chunk of broken glass in it! Obviously the kitchen staff is careless and sloppy."}
{"text":"We started with the Scallop Dynamite appetizer. It was really good, but it should be served on a bed of rice, as all the yummy juice is wasted without the rice. (We ordered a side of rice and dumped it in the leftover sauce, which was really good.) The Chili Shrimp roll is phenomenal. The Crazy Monkey roll was just ok. The Next time, we will try the Scallop Dynamite roll.  Great location. Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"The food is good and if you go during happy hour pretty reasonably priced as well. They have good cocktails, and I have been there twice and not had a problem with the service.  However... I realize this is Vegas and all, but the night club atmosphere was terrible! Plus, even if by chance you did get drunk enough to want to dance in the middle of a restaurant there would be no where to do that, which is weird because the DJ was playing the music so loud you can't even have a conversation, so you would think they were trying to get you to dance.  Overall, I would go back for happy hour, but try to sit outside to get away from the music."}
{"text":"Fast service. Clean place. Good music. Delicious food. Reasonable priced. Conveniently placed"}
{"text":"I've never had an issue with sushi before but unfortunately I got food poisoning from this location! I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty good \"American sushi\" and cheap happy hour drinks. I would never pay full price for this sushi though."}
{"text":"Everytime I wanna go get some sushi with my friends I hit this spot!"}
{"text":"We go here for happy hour. Off the happy hour menu we love the Vegas and rainbow rolls. I also really like the Gojira roll. It's definitely not the best sushi but the happy hour deals are good."}
{"text":"Good happy hour, but the food is lacking and expensive."}
{"text":"I've wanted to go here for a while now and was finally able to make it for happy hour. The happy hour prices weren't bad. Their drinks are really good and so is the service. The only thing that I didn't care for too much was the sushi. It wasn't bad, but I've had better sushi for less. It would be great if it tasted as good as it looked."}
{"text":"Usually have no problem going here. This time, food took forever to come out. Got 2 rolls. At my first bite, bit down on what seemed to be a little black pebble, took it out and set it on a plate. Continued eating. On my last piece of the other roll, same thing happened. I also took that piece out and set it on the plate. This one was a clear looking pebble. None of the rolls I got were raw. I told my server she didn't seem to really care and took it and showed the cooks. The cooks told her that it was \"peeper\" that some times gets hard. Never seen a piece of pepper that big and be clear? Also these pebbles didn't have any taste so i don't know how it would've been pepper. I asked to speak to a manager and she said that he was on lunch. Nothing got resolved and no one really cared. Won't be coming back here because I don't like rocks in my food."}
{"text":"After a long losing Sunday night in Vegas (what else is new?), we met some friends at Ra Sushi.  Umm...I thought we were having dinner, not going to a club...?? Confused, I walked inside anyways.  The wait for a table of 7 was an hour.  Some of us decided to wait at the bar, and the hostess was nice enough to find me and frequently tell me how much longer the wait would be (which was longer than said hour).  The one thing that saves this review is the TSUNAMI PUNCH.  It comes in a glass that's as big as my head.  It's a 60oz blend of sake, SoCo, Amaretto, vodka, juices....my goodness.  Please believe me when I say that you should share this with a friend or two!"}
{"text":"Just went to RA for date night and had such a fantastic time.  The ambiance is a nice combination of fun and relaxed, the service is always spot on and the food was delicious.  The yellow tail, my favorite, was melt in your mouth good.  We also got the Hot Mess, which my husband loved (it was too spicy for me).  Every time we go we love it.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Was meh. Not great not bad. Affordable prices for Vegas, though not a single Japanese/Asian sushi chef when we went on Friday... if that matters to you."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great and the bartenders rock!! If you're going, find a seat at the bar...best service and a view of the passer-bys on the strip makes for good people watching."}
{"text":"i love this place!! i went to vegas in the beginning of the month for a summer trip. i wanted to go to a new place with a view for my anniversary dinner but instead we went to eat sushi, which is my favorite. :) so i found this place and it was a decent price. the atmosphere is nice and there were a lot of ppl enjoying themselves. it was pretty dark in there but it wasnt a problem. the food was incredible. they have the softest salmon and hamachi ever!! we ordered a lot of dishes but my favorite was the viva las vegas roll. it was deeeelicious!! i will most def go back to this place next year. :)"}
{"text":"What?  LOL, this place is HELL.  Back in my hometown of Chicago, this is where all the My-New-Haircut-Guys would gather to act like they had culture because they were slamming Sake-Bombs and butting chests together.  I had a taste for sushi, it was on my way... I peeked inside and thought to myself, \"This can't be as bad as it looks.\"  Oh, yeah it can.  Note to the owners:  no, you cannot have BOTH a hip little sushi restaurant AND a sports bar.  It's loud, it's crowded, I had vegetable maki and it STILL smelled like old fish.  It's cheap, I'll give them that.  But if I had to deal with this place again, a chop stick would end up going through a baseball cap and into a skull."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi bars. The happy hour is great, the staff is always great. This is the best location in Az. Crazy monkey roll is delicious with mango sauce and cashews. They have a lot of good sushi specials."}
{"text":"I'm not an experience sushi water, I've only had it three times from three different restaurants. The shrimp Tempura Roll was pretty good and the grilled veggies were alright.  My friends get the viva Las Vegas Roll and it was really good.   Now, I gave three starts because the service wasn't good. First off, when we first got there it wasn't busy. Maybe 30 people and as we sat there it got somewhat busier. Our waiter was really friendly, but he forgot our order twice. My friends got their Viva Roll and as we waited for mine, the waiter came by and basically had to ask me what I ordered again. So about 15 min later I got my order finally. My friends then ordered another Roll and we waited 20 plus minutes and he came by and had to re-ask what that order was, Again. Plus my water was never refilled in that 20 minutes either and it was 105 degrees out. GIVE ME SOME WATER! As the manager came and asked how we're doing we told her that we haven't gotten our order and he's forgotten it twice, she tried to give us an excuse that the sushi bar is backed up. We just basically told her to cancel it, but... within 5 minutes we had another Viva Roll and my water was refilled. Plus before we got up from the table, another Viva Roll got to our table (but we told them we already got one).   She ended up giving us the second Viva Roll for free and some coupons. Which was really nice after terrible service."}
{"text":"I've been to RA plenty of times, though I don't eat seafood, I have many friends that do, and I always order the teriyaki skewers with white rice. Well tonight, I was feeling adventurous and decided to try a sushi roll. I ordered the Crispy Shrimp Tempera with the eel sauce and Sirachia on the side. The waitress was very nice and reassured me that that this is a highly recommended roll especially for newbies, and that it is fully cooked. I'll admit, when she brought out my dish, I felt immediate regret. I'm not sure why I don't like seafood, it's just not appealing to me so I never eat it. But recently I've really wanted to get past My seafood phobia, which is what brought on my seafood adventure tonight. So.. It was now or never. I first took a little taste if the eel sauce, it was super sweet like a teriyaki, soy sauce marinara. I liked it, and dribbled some all over my roll. I picked up my first slice, dipped it into a little Sirachia and popped it into my mouth, paused for a moment, then began to chew.... Surprisingly it did not have a hint of that sea taste which I dreaded so much. The shrimp literally tasted like fried chicken. It was soooooo good!!! I'm not sure if I will adventure out to other sushi rolls yet, but I will defiantly be ordering this again very soon!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food great, service great, atmosphere GREAT! The DJ was awesome!!! Better than some of the clubs there."}
{"text":"First off let me start off by saying that im a local and I work on the strip as a waitress . I have become a huge yelp fan only because I feel like people use yelp to just complain about thing's . When in reality I feel like the only reason why I will ever write a review and even bother is to give the place some credit. Im not a big sushi person but my girls are so anytime they want sushi we come here they get sushi and I get miso soup, cucumber kimche and other aps. I absolutely love this place . Everyone is so nice ... the hostesses are always sooo polite . My fav bartender is Francisco he is so much fun. I had a bad waiter once but I asked to get a different server and didn't let him ruin my experience. .. happy hour here is the best !! I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;"}
{"text":"I quite enjoyed Ra. It's important to realize that yes, it is kind of a hipster scene with the decor and loud music you'd expect from such a place, but I had a good time. This isn't your low key, authentic, hole in the wall sushi bar so if that's what you're looking for, it's best to keep moving.  They have a good happy hour menu from 4-7 with really inexpensive rolls, drinks and apps. I really enjoyed the lobster shrimp roll with asian pesto. The pesto really gave it a different flavor that I quite enjoyed. The wasabi mashed potatoes were also to my liking. I didn't actually have any bad food. Some of it was unmemorable, but perfectly acceptable.   The only thing I don't recommend is the Banzai martini. Good lord it was the grossest drink I've ever had. Very, very sweet... sickeningly sweet. Unless you want a drink that seems to have been created by a child prostitute or something, avoid this one. Just not good!"}
{"text":"I would have to give this place 3 stars because the quality and taste was just average. They have happy hour specials but not for all items. Once happy hour is done be careful ordering drinks for it may add up too quickly. Having a place in a location where the rent is probably incredibly expensive (fashion show mall), I could understand why their prices are a bit high and quality is just average. The overhead is too high. That is why you have to go to hole in the wall places. The crowd gets busy here at night at the bar. I come here to try the food, If i wanted to hang out i would go to a real bar."}
{"text":"The sushi wasn't horrible but if you're looking for GOOD real sushi, sushi Roku is the only way to go."}
{"text":"This place was really amazing! There were so many great drinks for us to try. The happy hour has a lot of food and drink items. Our server recommended a lot of great sushi rolls! The rolls were really creative and different. There was also some really good looking kitchen food that we will definitely be back to try! The inside of the restaurant is really nice, the lights were dim so it seemed a little romantic, but the patio was where it's at. I love people-watching! And we could look at the lights from the strip. All of the staff were so friendly and accommodating, they really took care of us. I definitely recommend checking this place out! I know I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Amazing! The service was great and so was the food. The manager also displayed great leadership by being hands on with the customers as well and was apart of the action front of house versus being unseen. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of RA but I decided to give them one last chance tonight, and it will be my last. The service was absolutely terrible and the food was mediocre at best. The waiter was rude and we were halfway done with our meal before he brought out our drinks. This was yet another bad experience at RA sushi and it will be my last."}
{"text":"I went to Ra sushi Restaurant around 2.00pm that atmosphere was nice maybe a little loud for the time of day it was but not bad. The host was very inviting and even went over the menu with us briefly. The server was fast and attentive to our need our food came out at a reasonable time, and was very good. I ordered their chicken teriyaki lunch special. All around the experience was great the price was low i will be going back"}
{"text":"Amazing...and I'm typically very picky with sushi! Fantastic customer service as well. Definitely recommend. The *Crunchy Calamari Roll* is to die for!"}
{"text":"I was very displeased with my service I thought that it was happy hour when really I ordered three minutes before and the staff should have said if you wait three minutes you'll be able to save $20... definitely do not have the customers best interest in mind. Never coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I forgot how slow and unfriendly the services is in tukee.  I walked in although four employees were there no one said a word.  I waited 3 minutes not a word so I left and went to living room next door.  Some one who was working said hello and offered to help us find a seat.   Less than 3 minutes I have a 10 dollar drink.  Worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place just validates my reasons for not spending money at chain \"Sushi\" restaurants.   I work near this restaurant. After a disappointing meal at Stingray I decided to try Ra.     What I ordered:    Pamatini - great    Kirin (in a bottle) - okay... but why no beers on draft? prefer it that way but whatever.    yellowtail sashimi - tasted great, but chomped on cartalige or bone when I was eating two of the pieces. Maybe train the sushi chefs a little better?    Lobster Roll - okay, but for the $14 price, not nearly as good as smaller restaurant's versions of lobster rolls,    Ra Chips n Salsa - THE WORST. for a signature dish, this sucked. overall it was slimy (see my comment below) and worse yet the tuna had the consistency and texture of old tuna that had been run through a blender. I read \"tuna tartar\" in the description and expected marinated chunks of tuna in this \"salsa\". Instead the tuna was used as a pureed binding agent to hold the over-ripe avocado, and cucumber chunks together. DISGUSTING, tried to eat it until I saw the \"slime\" then got nauseous and decided I couldn't stomach it.   I've worked in the restaurant industry as a server, bartender and prep-cook for 5 years. I'm telling you, this salsa was made several days prior to me eating it, as the ingredients had begun to meld together into a lumpy of slimy atrocity.     Service - Fast. However, my server, Katrina, asked me if I needed a box for the \"chips and salsa\" I had ordered. I said \"no, it was slimy\". Her reply: \"okay\" and took the plate away with out any further investigation.... no \"I'm sorry\" or \"what was wrong with the dish? why was it slimy?\"   A  gain, if I was a server for a long time. I know crappy food isn't a servers fault, hence the 20% tip. But if any of my costumers were unhappy with a dish, I FIXED it, whether its getting them something different, taking it off the bill (especially if it is not eaten) or getting a manager or chef involved to make sure it doesn't happen again. None of this happened. All I was looking for was a dialogue about the matter. I still paid for the dish and tipped 20% on top of it, I'm not looking for a free meal, especially since I didn't eat the majority of the dish, but take your job seriously and do SOMETHING no matter how menial it is... but since nothing was done, i will never return.

{"text":"I've been going to RA in Las Vegas and in Scottsdale for several years and it gets better all the time.  They offer one of the best Happy Hours around.  From 3-7pm and 10 pm-Midnight you get excellent drink and food specials.  Try the cold Kirin (22 oz) and hot sake (6 oz) for $7.  Then move on to many many food choices between $3-7.  Their Calamari Tempura (planks - not rings and tentacles) are the best I've had anywhere.  I also recommend the Crispy Spicy Tuna and Seared Tuna."}

Best of all try to get Tracy as your server and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best happy hour sushi.  Most consistent sushi in town.  Always a fun place to eat. I love the Vegas roll."}
{"text":"I actually liked this place. I thought the sushi was pretty good, I'm definitely not a \"sushi snob\" as they say but it tasted pretty damn good to me. The Vegas Rolls were AMAZING, oh my. The Blackened Chicken was delicious. I had fun drinking some Sake and Cosmos (During happy hour Saki is $1, and Cosmopolitans are $4) The service was a tad slow but that was definitely expected since the place was PACKED on a Friday night. I had a good experience here with friends celebrating there birthday. But the whole inside was very trendy, but it looked cute and it was working. The staff was ok it could of been better, but it also could of been worse. Our server didn't say hi or ask us if we wanted anything until we had to get her attention ourselves. But I'm not too sure if she hadn't noticed my boyfriend and I had joined the table or not since we came in later then our friends had. This location is a tad too far from me, so I won't be back to this one unless I'm over in that area."}
{"text":"Had lunch yesterday here and experienced a bit of a hiccup but wanted to review to compliment the management. I ordered the shrimp tempura bento box, which comes with miso soup, rice, spring roll, a pork wonton, and a salad. I was kinda picking at the salad, and ended up finding a feather in it. Lord knows how it got there, but hey, random stuff happens.  The waitress was visibly very grossed out, as she wouldn't even touch said feather with her hands. The manager came over, profusely apologized, and let me know that they had taken care of the meal. I hadn't expected that, just asked for a different salad from a new batch. I felt he dealt with the issue very professionally without making me feel like I had created a huge deal.  We were too early for HH specials, but I have enjoyed them before. While this isn't my favorite sushi joint, I would go back for HH again despite my experience. I was overall impressed with how the manager dealt with what was obviously just an unfortunate mishap."}
{"text":"I received an email from RA with a $20 coupon to use for my half birthday today, so we made our way to the old town location for happy hour this evening. If you haven't already, join their mailing list. They send amazing deals all year long and while the coupon can't be combined with the food on the happy hour menu, it can be combined with the drinks and our server was very willing and able to help us use the coupon to it's best benefit (which says a lot to me).  I ordered a lemon drop and it was super good. My husband ordered an old fashioned and it was pretty good, not the best, but what can I expect from a sushi bar. Our service was wonderful at the sushi bar and we enjoyed talking with the guy behind the bar. We ordered the shrimp tempura roll, the yellow monkey roll, and the viva Las Vegas roll. Hands down, the Vegas roll stole the show - it had great sweet, spicy and salty elements to create a delectable bite. We'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"RA! RAH! RAH! If I was writing about the Arizona locations, I probably would have rated it a three-star, if that, but this location situated on the plaza at the Fashion Show Mall has always been a favorite of mine.  The lunch Bento boxes are a bargain -- good on quality, great on quantity. What really wowed me was the Dengaku Tofu - Crispy like tempura but not greasy fried tofu served with tempura sauce with a red miso ginger glaze. Absolutely delicious! The Hamachi nigiri was very good, but if you want sushi, there are better places.  Service was pleasant and attentive. The only negative -- sitting on the outside patio listening to competing music with the restaurant next door as well as the ambiant noise from the center itself and Las Vegas Boulevard."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite place to eat. I love the atmosphere, the amazing sushi, and the drinks are delicious as well. I've personally always had good service every time I have eaten here as well."}
{"text":"Make sure you get there for happy hour or the shishito peppers go up an entire quarter. I guess they have redefined the term \"reverse happy hour\" where the business gets the deal. All the appetizers seamed skimpy. If trendy is the most important thing to you then this is the place. Average food, decent small serving size portions  = low value."}
{"text":"Food is 5 stars. The food is amazing and they have a pretty decent happy hour selection. The service is hit or miss. Find a good server and then request them. It's great when they're working but a crap shoot if they're not. If they could improve the service to be consistently decent (not even asking for good) and turn down the music volume then this would be a 5."}
{"text":"Service was amazing. Food was excellent. I wish the music was slightly lower, but that is because I am tired from an amazing Vegas trip :)"}
{"text":"Ra is Arizona sushi staple. Pretty great happy hour as well as a late night happy hour. Their menu selection is a little creative and not terrible for her those who don't eat seafood. The vibes are modern and trendy and the cocktail menu has a lot of flair. Sometimes the service can be hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been dining at this (the very first) Ra ever since it opened over 10 years ago.  Their Happy Hour is great and very reasonable."}
{"text":"I was visiting AZ from California yesterday and a colleague recommended this sushi place.  It was terrible.  The service was slow. I even told our waiter we were in a hurry and we still waited 40 minutes for one of the rolls only to find out the chef dropped the roll and had to remake it.  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. Over priced, mediocre and bland sushi. Not even worth the happy hour"}
{"text":"Loved RA for over 10 years ...went there twice a month with friends and family on Saturday evenings. Excellent music and good food. Corporate recently decided to stop their happy hour on Saturdays. This was always a great incentive to visit!  RA has over 75 restaurants in a 4 mile radius, many with Sat happy hours.  Its a ghost town in the lounge now...I hope Corporate reconsiders!!"}
{"text":"This place has really continued to go downhill over the past few years. Unfortunately my most recent experience ensures that I will not be again. My friends and I popped by to enjoy the reverse happy hour a couple evenings ago. Now again, the service here is typically subpar, so my expectations are never too high. The bartender delivers a martini I had ordered, and I go to take a sip. Immediately I felt like I had just sliced my lip open. When I looked at the glass, there was a huge shard sticking out where it had been broken. When the manager, Danny Hutchinson (I demanded his card) came over, he was so dismissive, even though my mouth had been cut, and I had only taken one sip of the drink. He said \"I suppose I can replace that drink you had. You know, this happens all the time\". I said what in the world!!! I would have imagined that the manager would have been a bit more concerned as and maybe offered a round of drinks for the table for our inconvenience, but he said look I can't just be buying drinks for every table..... I was appauled. He actually had the nerve to get an attitude with me. Like I said, never again!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, especially for the price. They have happy hour almost every day, which makes it affordable. The Vegas roll is a must/try. I like to sit at a table outside, there's a nice atmosphere. Staff's friendly. Plus parking is free."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went in there on Tuesday to celebrate our anniversary. The bartender made us feel well celebrated with not only providing us with happy hour prices for 2 of our sushis even though it was 7pm but also telling us what items he used for my Half Birthday certificate. It was his first time making the Watermelon and blueberry martini which was great. Once we told him it was our anniversary he presented us with an ice cream dessert which was great.   The only negative I could think of was we waited a few minutes for the Hostess to make an appearance but other than that it was a great time."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi place in the West Coast , no doubt , we are from California and we are here for the SFGiants Spring Training , and after a long day at the game today , and we just have the taste for some sushi, so we asked around and heard that this is the closest sushi place to our hotel , so we decided to give it a try and we were amazed , they use real crabs,for their rolls and the fish was as fresh as just like off the boat ...what an amazing place and believe me we love sushi but this place is top them all"}
{"text":"I love RA! We come here every Sunday to hear the great music from the DJ! However, this Sunday we came and there's no DJ! The vibe is just not the same anymore. Don't give me wrong the happy hour is good and the customer service is great! But it changes the whole vibe without the DJ on Sundays! :("}
{"text":"Love it here, Matt is awesome!!! But CSI on the TV's for 2 hours? Really? Open your eyes managers!!!!!"}
{"text":"We go to RA all the time- and it has been progressively getting worse.  For this review- I'll write only about my experience last night on the patio: I get there around 5:30 and the service is fine... fast forward 45 minutes and our waitress is no where to be found.The table next to us had a server come up after over 30 minutes and ask if they had been served- they said no.   We had to remind our server multiple times... \"we asked for a side of eel sauce\" \"We asked for another round of drinks\"  Besides the ridiculously slow service I HAD A HAIR ON MY VEGAS ROLL. The second the waitress set my plate down I pointed it out: and then had to wait another THIRTY minutes to get another vegas roll with no hair.   It wouldn't be a big deal but she passed the hair situation and crappy service off like it was nothing and didn't even mention in when the checks came around. I was in awe."}
{"text":"While it is a chain restaurant, I really enjoy the sushi here, and they have quite an extensive selection of it.  The tofu dish is a must try, we order it every time we dine here.  Also, the best music selection of any restaurant I've ever been to.   Make sure you check out their happy hour where many of their sushi are half priced.  *doesn't serve coke products"}
{"text":"Sat on patio, tables and chairs way to close. Wait stuff was good but sushi was inconsistent, ie pieces not same size. Rice wasn't wrapped all the way around rolls. Salmon seemed old."}
{"text":"Really cool ambiance if you are looking for a trendy spot. Food is good and pretty consistent."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed!!! I went to this restaurant for a friends birthday party, I'm pregnant and one of the cooks there I knew and his girlfriend served us. Well knowing I'm pregnant I knew there was nothing I could eat there besides two different things and a dessert. So I got dessert ... well! Come to find out this cook I knew PURPOSELY CROSS CONTAMINATED MY FOOD WITH RAW SHELLFISH! CAUSE HE BRAGGED ABOUT IT WND HIS GIRLFRIEND WHO WAS OUR SERVER KNEW CAUSE WELL HOW ELSE WOULD HE KNOW WHICH PLATE WAS MINE?! soo anyhow it was reported to the managers & cause they don't have \"video proof\" nothing will be done about it!! Even though MULTIPLE EMPLOYEES CAME FORWARD AND SAID HE DID IT!! But it's just all considered he said she said. If nothing's done I will be taking action. I know it's not the restaurants fault but them knowing it did happen and not taking action I'm very very upset and frustrated & super disappointed. By this happening they lost about 30 customers alone cause majority of my family and friends come here and won't be back.  So if you enjoy having a risky cook on the line this is the place to eat!"}
{"text":"This is a decent happy hour spot.  I go here occasionally with a group of my girlfriends (ages 20s and 30s) and we reserve one of the big corner booths.  Sushi is good, drinks are excellent.  Bill is usually around $30.  Service is decent."}
{"text":"I am an avid sushi lover and I especially love fried calamari. That being said when I visited RA the sushi I had there was not the best. The calamari was kinda soggy, and the soy sauce was extremely bland. I will not be visiting RA anymore."}
{"text":"My friend and I hadn't had sushi in a while and we were on Mill, so why not go to Ra?  I think the question should have been, \"Why go to Ra?\"    First of all, I walk in and there's three 15 year old girls standing at the host stand busily texting on their phones.  They all look up, but only one of them stops texting.  She looked visibly upset that I had interrupted her conversation and doesn't even really greet me.  I then say \"Table for two\" and she says \"Why don't you guys go sit over there, I'll get a waiter.\"  Not pointing in any general direction mind you.  Come to find out, it's the table right by the door (who wants to sit right by the door.... ever????)   So we sit there and can't see anything cuz it's super dark and the lights are mind numbing red.  I struggle to read the menu while I realize how thirsty I'm getting.  So we sit there, and sit there.  15 mintues went by before Random Server Girl walked up and took our drink order.  I made sure to order our edimame before she walked away.  Never introduced herself the whole time.  She didnt' have time to bring our drinks until the appitizer came (10 mins later) but she had plenty of time to go and chit chat with the 15 year olds at the host stand.  Grr!  Our drinks come and app come, she takes our food order.  I am a notorious soda chugger.  At least the first one, but we never see her again until our food comes.  She gets me a refill after I've drunk all the spit in my mouth from the salty edimame. Grr    Finally food and driks are there and I'm happy but careful not to finish my soda.  We never see her again and then she brings the check.  I actually was gonna order some sake for after my dinner but since she decided that we were done, I guess we were done.  Grr.    I paid andstill tipped her more than she deserved.  Moral of the story:  Service at Ra is terrible and the servers are magical, they just disappear right before your eyes!"}
{"text":"Only reason for a 2nd star was because the food was still good.  But definitely a zero star on the service   I have been here multiple times for lunch and the service is just HORRIBLE. SO incredibly slow. Even the initial greet was well over 5 minutes. Not to mention getting waters, the girl who filled water and such was sweet when she checked in on us. But getting the check and running the cards was SOOO slow. 8 minutes slow to be exact. That's a lot of time when people are on a lunch break. 8 minutes is the max it should take for food to come out of the kitchen, check should only be 2 min.  Now we are late back to work.   Don't recommend this as a lunch spot."}
{"text":"This was a fun little place that's connected to the mall! Great service - Adam was a hoot!  The scallop dynamite roll was delicious!!! Adam helped us pick out a roll because their list is pretty extensive. When the title says dynamite, it really means dynamite. It was a spicy roll but damn good. Tons of flavor! The Mochi ice cream dessert was also delicious. It's a semi acquired taste, but I tried the dessert in Hawaii for the first time about 2 years ago and haven't forgotten about it since! I think it's an amazing dessert that everyone should try. I wasn't a huge fan of the cinnamon tempura ice cream dessert. I expected more of a flash fried ice cream and got more of a doughy type fried ice cream on the outside."}
{"text":"I've only ordered the viva las vegas roll and the tootsie maki because i get full and they never fail to disappoint. Honestly I haven't even bothered to try anywhere else because it is so good."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for service after being seated.  We came in about 2:40, so we guessed it was because of shift change.  After staring at menu for 20 minutes was informed it was the wrong menu.  My other menu had like old teriyaki chicken on it, it was pretty disgusting.  We ordered a good amount of stuff, it all came out in a timely manner but was completely lackluster and remarkable in that I remarked about how dull and flavorless things were.  Pineapple cream cheese wontons were burnt, not black but daaaark brown and dry.  Potstickers were undercooked.  Tempura was super greasy.  The rolls we had were delicious, no complaints there.  Not enough to get me to come back though.  Booooo. Also, waitress asked if I needed change, which is a no no I think."}
{"text":"A bit pricey but completely worth it ! Especially if you go to their happy hour or reverse happy hour at night !!! Speciality drinks are delicious , service is really good even when super busy, and sushi is always fresh tasting ! Go on certain days and you'll run into the incredibly hot and super sweet bartender who is very knowledgable on everything in the kitchen as well as all drinks at the bar. Super patient every time I go with my difficult friends."}
{"text":"My wife wanted try Ra for a while. We had dinner before catching a movie. The server Alicia was prompt, courteous, very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. We told her it was our first visit and the manager, James came over to welcome us.   The food was great from the pineapple wontons, to the Viva Las Vegas roll. My wife doesn't eat sushi and had the vegetable roll.  Her words...AHMAZING!! We came back for dessert after our movie. Cinnamon Tempura Gelato...yeah...get that. We will be back for another impromptu date night!"}
{"text":"Worst service at any sushi or Las Vegas restaurant I've ever been to. Appetizers arrived with dinner, two people in our party didn't get food u til everyone else was finished eating and they had only order spring rolls and chicken teriyaki. Waitress kept complaining about kitchen."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had and I'm a big sushi snob. Great happy hour specials too. Try the viva Las Vegas roll.  The waiter was awful but the food is great."}
{"text":"Sushi was great the place was not. We were one of the first ones in for lunch and the place was still dirty from the night before. The seat we were sat at smelt heavy of vinegar, I could only assume someone had spilt a bottle of saki the night before. I would be very afraid if they had the lights on in there, the place just felt like it was going down hill and no one cared, the table wobbled, the bathroom was dirty etc. But sushi was good..."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service!!!!!!!!! Me and my friends went there after work for the happy hour.  We asked Jessica how things were, but she couldn't give a straight answer about if the fish was fresh. Then we put our drink order in and she decided to send about 10 to 15 minutes talking to the hostess the sushi chef was nice and found the female manger working and she brought our drinks to use and said that she would talk to Jessica. Food came the it was soo soo. My friend order the fried tofu it was soggy. Jessica did manage to make here happy and take off the her bill. My bill was a different story. It was happy hour and I guess that Jessica flunked out of basic math. She over charge my meal not once, not twice, but three times. They gave me happy hour prices for drinks but not for my food. If I had not would of been over charged over $10. My company sends people here for training I am going to tell all my co workers to pass the place up or just don't tip the horrible waitress Jessica with the bad red hair."}
{"text":"The sushi was OK. The service was horrible. Our waitress was too busy talking with the hostess to bring our drinks. She was reminded to bring us our drinks after the manger brought them out. On top of the HORRIBLE service, she got tried to overcharge us. Watch the happy hour pricing they try to make sure that your are all liquored up then try to pull a bait and switch on customers. If it was for the pure fact that I was looking at my bill they would of over charged me by at least $10. If you want to get sushi in Scottsdale downtown area, I suggest that you go some whee else or if you get Jessica with the red hair demand a different waitress!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurants beauty & ambience is ruined by music so loud I had to have my wife repeat what she was saying while sitting next to me."}
{"text":"I honestly only come to RA Sushi for the happy hour sake drinks with my friends and maybe a few appetizers. I ordered the Vegas roll and that was delicious! Every sunday was when my friends would go on a local night because there was DJ that played good music! sooo sake + music = good times!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite sushi in Vegas and anywhere else for that matter!  I come for the happy hour specials, you can't beat them!  And the sushi is delicious!      Great atmosphere, service, presentation, location and price!"}
{"text":"The garlic edamame was really good. We ordered the Philadelphia, dragon, rainbow, Vegas and crazy monkey rolls! They were all really good I really liked the dragon roll. We also ordered the dynamite scallops and they were good would of been better if they were bigger, they were tiny ones.  The service wasn't bad she did a good job. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the lighting, I couldn't see the menu barley Bc it was just red lights."}
{"text":"Did you know that RA had a lunch special menu? Well, my sister and I most definitely didn't. There is a deal with bento boxes for about $7 - $9. Which is a nice deal because the portions are so big for lunch and it fills you up. They are not that busy during the lunch hours. I had the Shrimp tempura Bento and my sister had the Vegetable tempura bento. It comes with two salads, rice, entree, and a couple of sauces.  On the regular menu during regular times, the sushi and other entrees are wonderful, too. They are big portions and great place to share a cocktail with your girlfriends."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the service. Most RA locations I've been to have snotty service but here they really are friendly. Sushi was delicious a lot better than my last RA experience at another location. Came in during Sunday happy which I would recommend."}
{"text":"RA is a good sushi place.  I didn't say great... but certainly not bad!  Being a chain, you get what you get.  If I was looking for sushi to knock my socks off, I'd probably find a smaller, family-owned restaurant.  However, RA does boast some good happy hour deals (and a new, Sunday-Funday menu) that will fill you up without breaking the bank.  And a $20 coupon on your half-birthday!    The Viva Las Vegas roll is quite popular, tasty, and a good \"beginner\" sushi roll.  When I have friends who aren't totally on board with eating raw fish, this crab-based, tempura-battered roll is a nice segue.  The other rolls are right around average.  I have no complaints, but it's nothing to write home (or Yelp) about.  The garlic edamame is pretty fabulous, and I can't let a piece go uneaten.  Definitely get those.  Service is good, and as quick as sushi can be.  If you go on a Friday or Saturday night, be prepared for more of a wait.  The atmosphere is a classy, Americanized Japanese decor.  It's a nice relaxed, slow meal."}
{"text":"Ra isn't a bad place at all. I've been to the ra in chino hills, and the one in Vegas. On the strip, at the shopping center. Prices are very reasonable. Food has always been fresh. And their happy hour is fair. I love their las Vegas roll. Not to mention their wide variety of beers and sake. The decor is nice. Dim, sheik, and colorful at the ra in chino hills. I was sat in the outside patio at the vegas ra. Which has a cool view of the strip. The waitresses here have always been up to par. I can't say any bad bad about this place. It would be nice if they had more locations. But oh well. All in all not a bad place for dinner."}
{"text":"Went here on 5/5. We waited and waited and waited. OMG. and waited.... IT was the theme of the night. On top of awful dishes. It took 20 minutes for water, 20 minutes for drinks, 20 minutes before she took our order. dishes came out sporatically and some took 45 minutes to get. Below are the dishes I personally ordered and tasted.    We ordered  Chilli Ponzu yellow tail roll - the sauce was awful, it was literally just hot sauce no intricate flavors.  Hot Mess - the rice was over cooked to the point it felt like you were chewing on a rock. And they did not use King crab more like Fake KING KRAB.  Pork Gyoza - Normally my daughter and I can't stop eating these, but these had no flavor we left half on the plate.  Ra chips and salsa - I have no idea what they were thinking. They covered the sushi with a overly sweet and sticky sauce that destroyed the fish flavor. I took 3 bites trying to like them but left the rest.  Garlic Edamame was the only decent edible food.  Then I ordered a teriyaki chicken for my daughter because she flat out refused to eat her favorite Gyoza. Asked them to please omit the teriyaki sauce just bring the cooked chicken. What we got was disgusting. It was covered in oil and all I can assume is black flakes all over it, reminiscent of grease leavings in an oil fryer. I have no clue I don't even care, at this point I was done with this place.    And the cherry on top..... my husband got food poisoning and was sick for days.   It's pretty safe to say we will be telling all our friends to avoid this place at all costs. We really should have known better considering the place only had 4 tables and every other restaurant by it was packed with a 2 hour wait time."}
{"text":"Take advantage of happy hour to get a good, reasonably priced sample of the rolls and other appetizers that RA offers.  They have good drink specials too.  I dropped in for a late dinner last night.  My only complaint was that the music was loud for my tastes,  I didn't know they had a dj spin on Sunday nights.  If you're into that, by all means, it's worth the trip."}
{"text":"We stopped here after walking down the strip. It is located within the Fashion Show Mall across from the Wynn. Friendly staff, extremely fresh and flavorful sushi, and good prices (at least for lunch). We got the rainbow roll and the spicy lobster roll for about $9 each, which also included miso soup. You can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Exceptional service.  I have unique vegetarian sushi requests and they not only accommodate, but one waitress came up with great custom roll ideas.  Always a clean pleasant experience."}
{"text":"WHY THE HELL DOES THIS PLACE ALWAYS SMELL LIKE A DIRTY WET RAG!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!       and the service SUXX."}
{"text":"I have to admit Im not that adventurous as I usually order the cheap lunch (Bento Box) with a friend but soon to change that and Im not really into raw fish that much. I still like this place its a young vibe-decor and clientele. I usually like the music -most of the time, but please hold the rap. The service is usually on top of things at lunchtime but last time got a waitress that must have been new and not really erm 'all there'.  Oh well, there doesnt seem to be that many sushi places in Gilbert. If the weather is nice I prefer eating outdoors (though the noise from Val Vista and nearby freeway can be distracting ). Most of my experiences with this place have been positive."}
{"text":"I love Ra, everything on their menu is soo good. Went there on 8/10, again, great food. I have to say tho the waiter was a little pushy and or not the greatest, I always wonder if you get service like that when you don't drink. One of the Dinner's encouraged sharing (just like sushi is sharing) so my Fiance and Mom shared a plate (After asking if it was a good amount, assumed) and the plate was real small and not for sharing. Thank god we had some extra sushi and my Fiance had some of that. Out for a family dinner, we don't drink but we got appetizers and a lot of stuff. Usually the service is really great on top of the food but the service was minimal, 4 stars for great food tho."}
{"text":"Disappointed to have my temp license turned down from Utah. I even brought my expired DL as backup, but apparently this place has a policy of not accepting out of state IDs.   Guess I won't be celebrating my birthday here ever again."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of RA and chain type places, but I find that their sashimi assortment (lunch menu) is delicious. The fish is very buttery and fresh. Lunch is served quickly and I visit it ~2 times a month during my lunch break."}
{"text":"They literally sit all colored people in the back of the restaurant where you can't be seen! I usually don't notice things like this but they couldn't make it anymore obvious and it literally pissed me off!  All white people were at the front of the store and all blacks and Hispanic where sat in the back next to me. This is fkn bullshit! They told me I would have to wait 15 min to be seated even though there was a lot of empty tables. Never felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant before!"}
{"text":"I didn't know Ra was homophobic. After the ball dropped on new years a gay couple was escorted out after making out in a bar full of people making out. The female bartender who escorted them away said they were too drunk in a room full of drunk people."}
{"text":"The non-sushi items were pretty impressive! I had a white fish taco that was absolutely delicious! The decor is pretty and the mood is very nice. I would like RA to bring down their happy hour prices-they are rather steep, and I don't appreciate the fact that they have 75 cents tagged on each price...it seems like an advertisement ploy to get you to think you're only paying $2, but in reality, you're almost paying $3. The sushi was not impressive-in the past, I heard that the cuts at RA were much bigger, but the sushi I had today was thin-more rice than tuna. The California roll fell short on size, flavor, and plating, and I had to go and ask for wasabi and ginger because none was given to us with our sushi. The ginger was also quite potent-more than the wasabi as far as heat. I wish it was pickled just a little longer. Please fix it RA! You're a pretty cool place!"}
{"text":"Good sushi in the middle of the desert. A bit pricey but hey, it's Vegas! Staff is flexible and will take custom made orders."}
{"text":"This place is complete TRASH. I never used yelp to leave comments. I made an account just for RA SUSHI. First of all, the white tall server with the tattoo sleeve looked like he was on drugs.  He quite didn't understand what my company was talking about and I didn't know where he was looking at when he was talking to me. Also, the whole place smelled like someone pissed on the floor. This is just the beginning, there is a lot more about the food. I always order Salmon (Sake) Nigiri whenever I go to a sushi bar. I've never tasted the Salmon that smelled so bad when I put it in my mouth. Don't even know how to explain it. It definately tasted like it went bad. We also ordered Uni sushi but they were out of it. We also ordered Sweet Shrimp with head and just the Shrimp (Ebi) Nigiri came out. The drugged server kept on arguing it was the Sweet Shrimp with head. The head wasn't even in the plate! Terrible experience. Doesn't even deserve 1 star. Im OUT."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here for our date night today and it was absolutely amazing!!! The prices were very reasonable for the portions that they give and their happy hour drinks were divine. I am sushi obsessed and I was very pleased with what I ordered. The viva Las Vegas roll is a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Good place to go grab some not so expensive sushi.  Service is usually extremely spotty though and the sushi takes forever.  At least it is somewhat fresh.  I can't remember the names of the sushis and sashimis and suzukis and spimonis I have eaten there.  But they are usually tasty.    Biggest downfall of this place is the terrible DJ music dance club crap that is playing way way too loud every time I have been there.  Near impossible to even hear the person next to you.  Solid 3 stars"}
{"text":"Great food and service every time. Our waitress was exceptional and offered garlic edamame instead of regular (didn't even know that was an option!) and we thanked her multiple times because it was so delicious!! Would definitely recommend for friends and family.  Also, this is a rock and roll sushi bar people! I see reviews on here of people upset because it's not kid friendly.. well guess what? There's not a kids menu and there's loud music and a full bar, so get over it and go to another restaurant, or suck it up. The restaurant isn't going to change its entire concept to please you with your two year old."}
{"text":"Went here whilst on vacation for some good ol Angel's spring training.  We went here with a hankering for some good sushi.  Our sushi chef, um, I don't remember his name, was awesome.  Instead of ordering off some menu, we had him serve his specialties.  I didn't ask what they were or what was in them, but they were great, from what I remember.  I am going to have to defer all other questions to Ash who went with me, she can answer better than I can.  The service was good, my hunny's Kirin and my Asahi's were cold and the lily sake or something like that, does the trick.  Boy oh boy does it.  One bad thing, the sushi chefs aren't allowed to drink with you.  Ni modos, it was still a great time.  I enjoyed it very mucho."}
{"text":"The food was just OK. The miso super super spicy, like noserunning spicy.   Service wasn't great. The table slightly smelled like a dirty cleaning cloth.  And the WORST of all they had a DJ with super loud music. AYFKM? Who wants a DJ in a sushi bar/restaurant? It was just annoying."}
{"text":"This was my first time here; & our server was so rude (Rob) that I don't think I'll be returning! There were six of us at the table for HH. The rolls were OK, nothing spectacular, albeit the HH prices are amazing! My girlfriend told Rob in the very beginning that we need separate checks. When the check came, it was lumped into one check. When we told him (politely) to please separate the checks, Rob literally said \"whatever!\" Horrible service!!"}
{"text":"RA, your food is dependably consistent...most of the time, but why oh why do you provide such slow service. Seriously, of the 15 to 20 times I have eaten here, the servers always disappear...for like 20 minutes. Are they all addicted to cigarettes? Are there company meetings between customers when I visit? Is staff on staff flirting the best use of company time since they don't seem to care about their tips? You may be asking yourself, why do I eat here if the service is so awful? Answer: 1. This is the better Japanese food near my work, 2. the prices are reasonable, 3.hmmm now you have me wondering why...  If you are here for some food and not to get wasted, you're on your hour lunch break, or you actually want to have a nice meal with people you enjoy I would not recommend going to the RA on Mill. Service is unexpected. I have gone in when there are only two or three tables, ordered regular food (not even sushi), then waited for no one since my waiter was nowhere to be found then had to get to go boxes before I could even start eating because it took sooooo long.  If you can make it to another location however, I do like the lunch Bento boxes, great deal for the money. You get Miso (which I don't eat since they use fish) ((*Tip for other vegetarians: their Tempura sauce also contains fish)), uchi no salad (good when made right, I'll even order the full size as my entrée sometimes), rice, a spinach gyoza, a vegetable spring roll, and your entrée. When I ate meat I liked the Chicken Katsu or the Chicken Teriyaki (the sauce is very very light, almost too light though). I also like the Veggie Tempura (I just use a tiny bit of soy for the sauce). They have pineapple cheese wontons which are pretty tasty but I wouldn't order them outside of their happy hour prices. Their spicy chicken teriyaki udon packs a punch and is nose sniffing hot. Make sure to add in the extra red sauce from around the bowl to get the full experience. When I'm in the mood for some sushi I will order cucumber avocado rolls. They actually have a very good dessert...it's tempura fried ice cream (it's big so make sure you have someone to share it with), it's sliced into four pieces and served with a berry sauce."}
{"text":"Ra-tarded is more like it. Let's just say I came to this particular Ra last year with my former roommate who was visiting from Manhattan. I wanted to impress her with some kickass sushi before she flew back.   But who was I kidding? What I impressed her with was a flighty, vapid, and giggly waitress, folks all around us falling off their stools after 10 too many sake bombs, mediocre fish, and Nickelback grinding our eardrums to little, stubby nubs.  Nickelback, people.   In a sushi bar.   Enough said.  2 stars."}
{"text":"Such a great experience this was. We shared some ahi tuna, vegas rolls, garlic snap peas, and had fried ice cream for dessert.   The Sushi was made perfectly!   One thing I would say about their green ice tea... DON'T GET IT!! It seriously tastes like someone took a diaper and rung it out in the tea.   The Garlic snap peas are my new favorite thing. Fried ice cream was amazing, it has a touch of cinnamon, which made it that much better!! I 'm craving more of it.   RA Sushi.... I will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Went for a late night snack just before closing time. Good service, good food. Had the Viva Las Vegas roll and some salmon sushi. Everything was good but I didn't realize the Viva Las Vegas roll was fried. Would have ordered something different if that had been clear."}
{"text":"Not first time here , usually is better but this time took more than 40 min until we decided to cancel our order. And we didn't ordered some fantastic  dishes, just one soup and some sushi . Not even busy enough to justify the delay.  I was pissed off yesterday when happened,  but isn't fair to give them 2 stars,  after all every time we've been here everything was really good . Still ,  they need to work on  kitchen ."}
{"text":"This location doesn't live up to the RA name.  Some of the bulbs are burned out or flickering off and on.  They gave us the wrong dish and charged us for it.  The cream cheese in the sushi rolls was so cold it was almost frozen... and in square chunks.  Our server dropped our credit card under the booth and I had to reach under there and get it because he didn't offer... OMG you do NOT want to know what was under there.  It was a painful dinner."}
{"text":"We had a great time here. The wife and I sat down on the patio on a Sunday afternoon and left three hours later. Sampled a bunch of different rolls. The 22 oz beers went down easy and the waiter was totally awesome. No pressure, no rush. Giants game on the tube. Couldn't have had a better day. Oh ya, the food was killer as were their prices. Will return!!"}
{"text":"The happy hour here is fantastic. The sushi too!  Our waitress was very attentive and gave good suggestions. The Viva Las Vegas roll is a must.  Looking forward to going back!!  $2 and $3 beers too!"}
{"text":"Overrated is probably the best way to rate this place. Any sushi place that requires a \"sushi 101\" menu is not worth going to IMO. My sister and I can typically get three rolls and get full before we can finish. The rolls here were WAY over priced and very small. They weren't interesting or even really delicious. They were all sort of bland. We had a Rainbow, Dragon and some shrimp thing that I didn't even taste the shrimp in. It ended up costing us $20 a person and we left totally unsatisfied. There has to be better and more reasonably priced sushi on the strip!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch.  They have nice specials which include: Miso soup, salad and sashimi with rice.  Staff is very friendly.  Here's the thing: Miso was great. Salad was wilted and with bell peppers?  Never had Asian salad with Bell peppers..chilis yes, but bell peppers? Yuck.  The rice did not come out with my meal.  I had 4 people come over all confused about who was doing what. They had the right heart, but..service was disorganized, but friendly.  When asked if everything was okay..I made the statement about the salad..it was old and wilted and... I wasn't offered a replacement.  When the rice finally got to me it was a HUGH softball size and so dry and nasty and tasteless that  I didn't eat it.  The Tuna sashimi though...was EXCELLENT,  the wasabi was powerful and they serve white ginger, but it was dry.  So...they need improvement--period. It was a $12 lunch plus tip."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food for a chain sushi restaurant! Enjoy the sake bombs and every role has a unique flavor of its own! Go to the ray rd location for a good time and a movie afterwards!"}
{"text":"On Sunday the 5th of may. A couple of buddies and I were craving some sushi. I recommend RA since it was close but one of my friends is a huge yelper. Won't go to any restaurant that has less that 3.5 stars. This RA on mill had 2.5..anyway I talked him into goin. They ordered a couple sushi rolls and I ordered the teriyaki bowl. My first bite was super crunchy. I immediately spit it out in and ended up spitting out shattered GLASS. There was broken GLASS all in my entree. Personally, I couldn't believe I didn't cut my mouth or swallow any of the glass. The bartender removed the plate immediately.. the manager came and said sorry asked if I was okay. He said I could get anything I wanted and they would take care of it. I was so shocked that I had GLASS in my food I lost my appetite. The manager took care of my drinks which were 2 margaritas. But my friends each had to pay for there sushi that they didn't even end up eating because they lost there appetite as well. I don't know how the manager didnt take care of the whole bill. They are lucky I didn't hurt myself while I was chewing on glass. No wonder it has 2.5 stars I will never eat at a RA restaurant after the poor experience I had while dining there."}
{"text":"Like several others have said, Ra is the Sushi Bar for people who don't love(or even like) Sushi. I had their Spicy Yellowtail roll which was indeed very good, but compared to many other Sushi places a bit expensive.  The atmosphere is overly trendy with music so loud you can barely even have a conversation. I also found the photo lab lighting to be kind of creepy. Why in the world would you use that type of lighting for a restaurant?  Also, although I did like what I had, there are many neighborhood/off-the-radar sushi places which are of far better quality. The Sushi at Ra is really nothing special. The happy hour deal is pretty good though, so look into that if you want to get a little more for your money."}
{"text":"Been going to RA for many years ,Favorites are the Crunchy Calimari Roll and the Seared Tuna.  Great service"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Especially when I frequently visit RA Sushi in Scottsdale AZ. First off the menus they gave us were disgusting - grimy and dirty and it was only 5pm which makes me think they were dirty from the previous evening. The table wasn't clean either.   When our waitress came over she had an attitude. I immediately wanted to walk out but my friends insisted we stay because I had told them about the one in Scottsdale.   The sushi was 'ok'. Presentation was sloppy except for the Vegas role. We ordered mostly sashimi. We wasted 80.00 on crappy service and sub-par sushi.   Additional, our waitress was eating a sushi roll that was left on the sushi bar which I assumed she had ordered while she was taking care of customers. She should have just taken a break. I won't be returning and won't be recommending this chain again."}
{"text":"Went to dinner tonight and got horrible service, nothing worse than serving you a semi-warm overpriced beer in a warm glass. Food was ok way overpriced."}
{"text":"I typically enjoy the sushi at Ra.  The Las Vegas roll is delicious as is the scallop dynamite.  The scallop dynamite is a roll that is served hot from the broiler and is amazing.  However, last time I was there, it came out on a nasty brown dish, sitting in brown grease with black pieces of charred food floating in it.  Now , I assume hat they normally re-plate after they cook it? Because it has never been presented to me like this before.  Very unappetizing.  It tasted okay, but was overly greasy .   And don't join their mailing list- they send way too much junk email."}
{"text":"Great for Sushi on a Friday night, since it's next to everything.  Seated very quickly, which is pretty awesome for a college area on a Friday night.  Even though i was a big pain in the a$$ that night, my waitress was really nice.  I was disappointed in their lack of soft shelled crab on the sushi menu.  My favorite is the spider roll and the one choice they had was NOTHING like it, and really pricey."}
{"text":"Overall, very average. I've eaten here twice, both times the service was terrible, rolls small, & other than happy hour, very expensive. Unless you are just looking to eat in the \"vegas\" sushi spot, which I would save for late in the evening b/c that's when it kinda turns into a \"club\", I would get more, better tasting sushi, for less money a few miles away @ the local spot, sushi twister!"}
{"text":"Sushi was surprisingly fresh even though we're inland. For starters, I really loved the authentic flavor of the green tea. Alex, my server, was nice enough to serve it over ice for me since it's so hot outside! Alex provided 5 star service and was very attentive.   I had the Sashimi salad and nigiri yellowtail, salmon, and mackerel. The ponzu dressing on the salad was a bit salty. I should have asked for it on the side as I don't like a lot of dressing on my salad. On the other hand, the nigiri was excellent especially the salmon.  I also gave one less star because they ran out of uni which was going to be the highlight of my dinner; nevertheless I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been going to Ra for years and lately I have not been a fan....I'm not sure if the restaurant is getting worse or that my taste in sushi has improved since my college days....but either way it is not good.   It is always too loud in there to where you can barely have a conversation at your table...and their food is sub-par.  If you want great sushi...I suggest going else-where....  Not to mention....I got food poisoning there in June of 09 that required a trip to the ER.  When I later called the manager to notify them of the situation....he seemed pretty unconcerned.  He didn't offer me anything...not even to pay for my dinner that later landed me a $200 ER bill!!!"}
{"text":"I'll keep this short, sweet, and to the point.  A few of the rolls I had were excellent.  My favorite were the Rakin shrimp, and the other shrimp roll which is similar but spicy with jalapenos.  My criticism of RA is that imo they use cream cheese in most of their rolls.  It added a great flavor to some of them but it became redundant after a while and I would like to see more avocado mixed in.  If you like cream cheese in your sushi you will love their rolls.  For me it was a 4/5 because it was a bit much on the cream cheese."}
{"text":"Long wait...  When I have to wait 40 minutes for a bento box, something is seriously gone wrong. Food is pretty pedestrian, location is a plus."}
{"text":"I've been to the Scottsdale restaurant in the past, and visited the Vegas location last night. This is pretty much my type of restaurant..... sexy, fun environment, upbeat modern music, and of course great food. They have great happy hours, and on Sunday the HH is 3pm-close. Awesome food and drink specials during that time, with a variety of rolls to choose from for under $10. For those prices, I kind of expected the quality to suffer, but the sushi is very fresh and all of the food is delicious and presented nicely. I only wish they would open a location or two in the Bay Area, I would practically live there."}
{"text":"Outside of a random trip here several years ago for a $12 martini, this was the first time I'd actually eaten at Ra.  It was packed and it was the night that all proceeds went to the fallen firefighters, so big props to Ra for doing that! We ended up scoring an outside seat and happy hour goodies. Inside was ridiculously loud music-wise, not quite sure how anyone hears anything in there? Outside was great, the music was good, and at a reasonable level.  Ordered the basics: a california roll ($4) and an avocado roll ($3). California roll wasn't good and made me sick when I got home. Avocado roll was very tasty and packed with avocado. Best part of the meal was my drink--the bellini ($5)! A frozen mix of deliciousness, where peaches and strawberries abound!  Our server, Heidi, was great. She was friendly and on top of things, despite how busy it was. She's also the one who recommended the bellini.  Prices for happy hour range from $2 (hot sake) to $7 for drinks and $3-$7 for food. This is probably the only time I'd eat here. They have an email club you can sign up for, where they'll send you a $20 certificate for your half-birthday month and something for your birthday month.  So, to summarize, 4 stars for the drinks, atmosphere, and service, but an unimpressed 2 stars for the food. Will compromise and go with 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is my go to place everytime my friends and I are hungry late at night and need a sake fix. Best place for late night and bar crawl from there. Tonight was awesome coz there was a little error On our bill and mighty man Todd came to the rescue to correct the issue,while  our  awesome waiter was busy. Over all,  service was good and food was amazing as always. Cheers ra!"}
{"text":"The food was alright, as was service. However, there was a table near us quite literally yelling and cursing and the staff did nothing to calm the situation. Very poor experience as a result."}
{"text":"This RA is pretty big. With a lot of sitting inside and outside. Service was normal. Prices were normal. There was plenty of parking. I would go back."}
{"text":"Server was great but food is sub par for the location and price. After happy hour it was a ghost town. Sushi is OK but rest of foods SUCKS. Wasted my Friday night dinner. Worse calamari in the city!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience yesterday.  One of the worst experiences I've had at a restaurant.  In fact leaving this review is what urged me to finally sign up on Yelp.    I work on Mill.  I went there with 7 friends from work Friday for lunch.  The place was only 1/3 full. So really not that busy. We were seated quickly, but then the following series of events occurred:   - 10 minutes later our waitress took our drink order -  15 minutes later food order  - 40 minutes into our experience 2 of us got our food -  10 minutes later 3 more of us got our food  - 10 min later,  the waitress came over and asked us if we're missing anything. YES! 2 of us still don't have food and we've been here for an hour.  The waitress asked \"do you want me to go check on that?\".  Come on! Right?  No, we'll just hang out for another hour and see what happens ; ) - 5 minutes later, she brings one of my friend's dishes over, he asks that it be put in a box as we have to get back to work now. - 15 minutes later his boxed up food isn't there yet. We have to ask. 5 more minutes it comes and it's a chicken bowl, he ordered beef. HA! - My other friend who still never got his food cancels his order - We get our check and it was incorrect. We had free appetizer coupons. And the 2 free appetizers were not free on our checks. Waited for that to be corrected too  It was absolutely ridiculous. Thank goodness I was there with friends. We were laughing at the situation the whole time. If I was there by myself, I probably would have shot myself in the face."}
{"text":"Food was BOMB. So yummy and such good happy hour prices! Would have gotten five stars if it weren't for our server who was borderline comatose.  We ordered food, drinks and appetizers all at once (hey we were hot and hungry!) Waitress bumbles around for like 5 minutes carrying our food before she sees us again. No, we haven't moved, still right here.  She drops off our appetizers and asks us if there's anything we need. Um... drinks? Waters? Please? Oh... sure, sorry. She goes over to the bar and picks them up where they have evidently been sitting for a while.  We start happily noshing and the food is so good, just what we needed after a long day at a pool party :) We ask our waitress for soy sauce because there's none on our table. Instead of grabbing one from another table, she randomly wanders off for 5 minutes only to return empty handed again. SOY SAUCE PLEASE. It's sushi! You need soy sauce! Oh, right. She gets some from the sushi bar.  Anything else? We politely ask for some glasses, she delivered our sake bottle with no glasses and there are 4 of us.  Glasses? she asks. Yes. For the sake. Oh... you mean like... oh. Ok just a minute. We literally just stared at each other in disbelief. Maybe before Ra hires people they should make them actually eat a sushi dinner first, so that the servers are aware of what normally accompanies such a meal (soy sauce, drinks, glasses, chop sticks).  haha I know I'm being bitchy, it was probably her first day or something, but jeez. Food was so good tho, def will come back!"}
{"text":"Nice place to unwind on a weekend.  Very consistent food, service.   Nice people and atmosphere.   Not usually crowded."}
{"text":"This place is excellent! Saki bombs are kudos! Customer service is on point. It's off the strip and conveniently located in Scottsdale, Az."}
{"text":"When you first walk into this restaurant, the ambiance is club like. Except the music is not as loud as the clubs. The ladies in the front are very friendly and the waitress was very attentive. We went during happy hour and LOVED the variety especially the prices. Since I am pregnant, my selection was very limited.  They get a 3 star is because they charged me for items that I did not get. I dont know if the waitress was not paying attention because we did have to ask her for some of the items. I should've checked the receipt before we left."}
{"text":"We should have learned. Tonight was our third attempt at dinning at this RA location & as before it was absolutely disappointing. We decided last time that we would not be back, but we decided to go once again for the company of our friends. The service was extremely slow & the server used the same excuse as was used upon our last visit, \"Sorry, we have 2 kitchens.\" This response is not acceptable! Please inform your patrons upon arriving it will take 30-45 minutes to receive your sushi. Also, there is no excuse for why it took 20-25 minutes for 2 cocktails, 2 beers & 1 glass of wine to be delivered to our table."}
{"text":"This ended up being a perfect find for our bachelor party of 17 buddies. We even ended up right next to a bachelorette with just as many. Pretty fun. The food was awesome. More creative rolls and sushi than I have seen in a long time. Super tasty. I got a spicy chirashi bowl too which nailed it. We drowned ourselves in sake and beer. So much so that we all just about had our own bottle to hit the strip with.   And the best part...The meal cost us $32 each. We were more than full and plenty liquored up by the end. No group of 17 dudes can get out of a meal for that type of price. Especially raw fish!  Dive in."}
{"text":"I'm not usually the biggest fan of Ra to begin with but we go there every now and then for Happy hour for sushi.  We decided to go to the Awhatukee location this time instead of Tempe.  Parking is usually crazy because they share it with a movie theater and other businesses.   We were seated and ordered our drinks and all was well.  We ordered our food and we ordered 3 rolls.  It took them 45 minutes to bring out our rolls when we were starving.  They never take that long and it was just unacceptable.  Every time we asked our server to bring us something we knew it was going to take him 10 minutes to come back with it.  Our daughter was waiting for her cheater chopsticks so she could eat with us, and that took forever. Same with our bill etc. It was a pain in the ass.  Their rolls are pretty mediocre anyway.  They are never rolled tightly and they are tiny.  I don't think we will be visiting a chain like this in a while.  We will stick to a mom and pop sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a long time !! Went with some co-workers had a great meal &dessert . The lighting is a bit dark but over good atmosphere. Our waiter was really friendly and informative ,also came back to check on us alot. Will defiantly be coming back for some more sushi:)"}
{"text":"Eh, it's okay.  Wanted to grab some dinner before heading out into the night scene. They have a variety of rolls as well as other japanese inspired dishes. Our table decided to get mostly sushi rolls.  I got some hamachi and the gojira roll. Hamachi was cut pretty thin and was just okay.  Gojira roll was good and came with like a spicy mayo and sriracha sauce on the side. Gave it a good kick. One of my buddies got like some lobster roll and I couldn't quite put my finger on it but it didn't taste right. There was a really odd aftertaste that was unpleasant. My buddies were trying to get everyone to try a piece just so they could get rid of it. Ended up not finishing those rolls.  Everything was just pretty mediocre and the rolls aren't that big."}
{"text":"I always enjoy the food and drinks here. The place has a nice decor and good outdoor seating on the strip. I've waited to review until I've been here more then twice, lastnight was my third. Everytime I have no complaints with the food, all delicious. But everytime service seems slow, they are actually lucky I came back after my first time here. But the food and atmosphere seemed like it deserved a second chance. My first time we waited 20 minutes just to get our drinks! We had to wave our hand in the air for then to notice! Other times I've visited not nearly as extreme but the waitress seemed a little stressed and confused. Would come back to the table and re ask what it is we ordered. Food amazing, drinks good. Service questionable."}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere at the scottsdale location is not up to par for what I know RA has to offer. The back room smells like peed by the bathrooms and it's not clean. The hostesses were not professional and the servers were even worse! I would not go back to this location!!!!"}
{"text":"I am not an educated, sushi guru by any means. But I do LOVE the Viva Las Vegas roll! It's a little overpriced, and really only worth it if you go during happy hour. My husband had never had sushi before, so when we sat at the sushi bar the man making our sushi was very friendly and informative. The beer prices needed to come down another $1/ea to get a 5 star rating from me. We will most likely go back."}
{"text":"I sat there for 18 minutes and never was served, not a menu, not a glass of water, not a glance in my direction even though the loud table next to me was served twice in that 18 minutes. I just left. I do not think the sushi chefs inspired with confidence in their sushi making technique either as I walked past on my way to the street. Once outside I had a choice of a pizza joint, a crab shack type place, and  a CVS. CVS, that was the place, recommended over RA Sushi, definitely."}
{"text":"I was a little concerned by the decor and vibe that my toddler and infant wouldn't have as good of a time... but I really wanted some sushi, and I'm a gambler. ;)  The sushi was great! Loved the mango lobster roll, loved the rainbow rolls, and loved the coconut créme brulee.   The staff was really friendly and helpful. Even though they don't have traditional kids stuff, my little guy enjoyed a snowball looking bowl of white rice, edamame and sushi.   It was a good experience, and we will be returning soon, but probably for a date night next time."}
{"text":"Had a bug in my sake and they did not even care! Saryah was our waitress and although attentive not friendly nor apologetic about the visitor in my drink.... will I go back probably not....2 stars cause the food was good...too bad the service was NOT"}
{"text":"I love this place. I came in alone after work and sat the the bar. There were a two bartenders working and both were very pleasant. I agree with everyone else that the food is overpriced but happy hour and reserve happy hour are the only times to go. I got a free edamame for checking in on four square which was nice and delicious. The sushi was fresh and the presentation was gorgeous."}
{"text":"This is a place you come when you don't know better. Swung by with some friends for happy hour. Fun atmosphere, lively located outside of Fashion Show Mall, but the food is just ok.  I would stop here if I'm hungry with no other options. But if you don't know the difference between good sushi and bad you may have a different opinion."}
{"text":"The service here is laughably bad. After 3 times having consistently bad service, I don't think I'll be back. The sushi at this location is very hit or miss and the edemame is usually falling apart. I just don't think it's that hard to fake a good attitude and give good service. I guess it's my fault for giving it so many chances."}
{"text":"Great happy hour prices! Service was good and the place is nice. Try the Las Vegas roll, its super good. A little far from where we were staying so we took an Uber, but its worth the extra time!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience but the sushi rolls were the worse I have ever had. The tempura on the shrimp was virtually non-existent and the sushi rolls weren't wrapped properly (very loose). My friend and I were really hungry after walking all the way from ballys to the mall where the restaurant was located and to finally sit down and taste this nonsense was a big disappointment. I ordered a gingerale and instead of the server informing me that they don't have gingerale he took the liberty of mixing a sprite with a Coke and served me what he referred to as a \"bootleg gingerale\". This place needs to not only invest in a better sushi chef but needs to re-train their staff on full disclosure and not to have a \"make your own rules mentality\"."}
{"text":"I will come to Ra sushi forever it's a classic that never gets old. It's so good. Just need to update the menu off of Postmates!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The sushi is to die for! I really wish they would open one is Los Angeles. If you go try their Viva Las Vegas Roll and the Gojira Roll. They are out of this world good. The mushroom miso was a little weird because it was really not miso-ey (if that makes any sense).   Also, if you go on a Sunday they have a DJ and their happy hour is amazing. I love happy hour and this is by far one of my favorites in Vegas. If you are staying at the Wynn it is directly across the street. So make sure you give it a try. I would definitely  recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Mango lobster spring rolls to die for. Edamame had just the right saltiness. And all sushi is delicious. I also got some salmon that literally melted in my mouth. Came during happy hour and still payed $100. Maybe a little overpriced but the food quality is great. Coming back again!!"}
{"text":"I do love ra. In all of its corporate glory. That being said this isn't my favorite location...Mesa or Huntington Beach win that battle every time. But the service is always good (once you get sat...we've had some lengthy waits at the door when the hostess was MIA) and the food is always delicious. They have changed the menu since I was last in (not that long ago)...new prices on some things (I'm lookin at you happy hour menu) but it's not enough to turn me away.   Love or hate corporate sushi, sometimes you just need a Ra Vegas roll (VIVA!!!)"}
{"text":"RA has fast-food quality sushi. It used to be a little better years back, but the quality keeps slipping. Still, their happy hour has some value. Yet, my one star has nothing to do with the food (which still is only a 2 in its own right). On my last visit, our table of seven requested to have one of the two TVs turned to a sporting event of our choosing. Yet, it was readily apparent that the manager was far too interested in a certain football game to change the channel. (It was also apparent that no one else was watching TV in the joint - the place was empty.) Upon a second request, the manager changed the channel of the second TV which was farther away from our table and obstructed. I am perfectly fine with not getting a TV changed if another customer requested something else before me. Yet, when it is an employee - let alone a manager - who prefers something else, they are probably in the wrong profession. Add to all of this that there were seven of us in an otherwise dead restaurant. Simply pathetic."}
{"text":"I have liked this place since my boyfriend and our friends would go here on Sunday nights in college!  We would go after 8 pm because they have great sushi, appetizer and drink specials.  Our favorite are the qyoza, chicken wings, tootsie rolls, and the Viva Las Vegas rolls!  It was always so much fun and the staff was always so friendly.  The atmosphere is cool and swanky lol...my boyfriend loved to do the saki bombs and i would love to get their martinis...they play good music and it gets pretty crowded...make sure you have a table otherwise you will not be able to sit down!  Fun place!"}
{"text":"I loves me some sushi, and this is the best that I have ever had. I pride myself on being able to taste and recreate dishes, and this one was so complex and well balanced that I couldn't figure it out. If you go try the \"Hot Mess\" roll, it's the bomb. When we were there it had a really great atmosphere, the music was really pumping. My wife claimed it was so loud she couldn't taste her food....what a nut."}
{"text":"It's unfortunate because we had been there the week before on a Monday and sat at the bar, wonder service and experience but yesterday not so much...  Went to Ra yesterday (Sunday night around 9pm) and there wasn't very many people in the whole place but music was blasting from the bar area. Little obnoxious (just because it's louder doesn't make it better, this isn't Tao). There was no hostess around and finally a waiter took us to the dining area. We asked for a booth and out of the entire dining area, there was one other party and of course we were seated directly behind them and next to the kitchen entrance non the less (lazy seating if you ask me, people don't like to sit next to other people... like in a movie theater). It stunk and the booth seats looked greasy and bits of food left over from the previous party (is this the only booth they use?). We asked to move to a table and we were moved to near the walkway (again, kind of lazy) and there was food all over the floor yet again. So weird because they weren't busy whatsoever. We decided to go elsewhere and on the way out saw the hostess sitting on the counter as she mumbled \"goodnight\" to us. Maybe she could have vacuumed the place since it was so slow and seemed to be doing nothing else but \"stealing a paycheck\".  Also the bathroom smelt like a bathroom... not good.   Ra always has good food, I just wish they out more effort into their appearance."}
{"text":"Decent place in Tempe. The happy hour is the way to go here if you want to save money for above average sushi. We started out with the edamame. It was extra salty and I scraped off almost every piece I touched. For our meal we ordered the viva las vegas roll, spicy yellowtail roll, spicy salmon, and the shrimp tempura roll. All of them were delicious but definitely not as fresh tasting as the Scottsdale location. Maybe my tastebuds are off.. Our service was about an 8/10"}
{"text":"The first time I visited RA sushi was with my brother in 2010. I remember it being pretty great and wanting to visit in the future due to a very special drink they had, Ginger Strawberry Lemonade.   Fast forward to 2012 and I finally get the chance to go back to RA. The service was about the same and so was the food. Unfortunately, they discontinued the Ginger Strawberry Lemonade, but everything was just like I remembered it so I was satisfied and planned to come back.   Now, in 2015, I won't go back to RA. The service has become AWFUL. I've had to wait over 30 minutes for my waiter to take my drink order. Their staff isn't attentive at all and their food has dipped in quality too. Don't get me wrong, their speciality item, the Las Vegas Roll, is freakin' delcious, but the cons of this place spoil the sacredness of that special, little menu item.   It's unfortunate but true. RA, please get your act together! You were once a great place and I miss being a regular. I'd love to grace you with my money once more, but until you can get your staff some training, I can't come back. I'm sorry."}
{"text":"Went here on a date last night, we love this place! Great sushi, decent prices (especially during happy hour) and awesome service. the RA membership program is worth signing up, I got a $20 gift certificate for my bday! Made the whole night special."}
{"text":"On the Strip, at the entrance of the Fashion Show Mall.  Very nice inside, came here for a late lunch, ordered a steak bento box meal, wife had some sushi (I dont remember which ones), my box meal was a little skimpy, sushi was alright.....Great selections of martinis, I usually go down the list and try most of them until I find a favorite.  Our waitress was nice and attentive, a Hawaiian implant  :)... I hear happy hour is pretty good."}
{"text":"The sushi is average, not very good seating, The service seems to be the same. It's extremely dark inside so if you are not looking to really see the person you are with its perfect. The happy hour drinks are the best part"}
{"text":"I'm torn what rating to give RA Sushi. I've been here a few times already and don't have too much to complain about. I live in Vegas so really the only time I come out to RA is when I get unbeatable \"hook up\" emails. Other than that, I stick to the local joints. Anyways! Back on topic. Decided to have dinner tonight with the husband (of course had an awesome coupon). We were seated very quickly...Although it took about 15mins to get even a drink order in. We didnt even get acknowledged for the longest time by anyone. No, it wasnt busy at all, even on a Friday night. Finally we get our drinks and order right away. Holy cow. Took about 20mins to just get the edamame then 10mins later comes out the 4 rolls. We had to ask for refills since our waitress rarely came to check on us. She was really nice when she did actually come around, but the overall timing experience was ridiculous.  Check time! Took about 20mins for the check. I felt like our waitress Annemarie was more attentive when I was looking at yelp reviews and when we were laying money down for the bill. Again, I will only come down here if I have awesome coupons or e-deals. I'll stick to my local favorites."}
{"text":"Service not great , they had no idea if we had to order from sushi bar or waitress. We sat at the sushi bar and I ordered a spicy salmon roll and they brought and old one that was refrigerated even though we sat at the sushi bar to get fresh rolls. No wadabi i or ginger served , we had to ask and they reluctantly brought it   Not a happy dinner"}
{"text":"I really like the RA in Tempe and always feel their service is good. I went to a friend and stood at the hostess table for 5-10 minutes and were ignored by all the wait staff. I was a server and if I saw two people waiting to be seated I would always say something at a minimum. I am writing this review because I found this to be unacceptable because my friend and I left because we didn't think we would be sat."}
{"text":"I like the Mesa and Tempe locations better, but this place suffices if I'm in Old Town Scottsdale and need a sushi fixin'. Service can be slow at times, but it's not all that bad. It's hard to get a table though, especially on weekends - even if you call ahead of time.  As for the sushi itself, like I've said with the other locations... it's not fantastic, but it's not horrible either. If that's not your thing, go with the teppanyaki, especially during happy hour (again, if you can get a table)."}
{"text":"Just went last night...Great! We sat at the sushi bar where you can watch the guys slicin' n' dicin'. I ordered the Udon noodles and chicken. SO good. Just the right amount of spice, but not too hot that it takes away from the flavor. Everyone was very nice and helpful... we got the lady up front to help us get a cab."}
{"text":"NOT impressed. So even though I ordered a mix of sushi I apparently didn't look like a good patron to them and was treated like crap. I've tried this place a couple of times now just to give them the benefit of the doubt and this last time was the last straw."}
{"text":"Been here once only but that was one of the best dining/drinking experiences of my life.  Well, I did come here for their Service Industry Night on a Sunday evening so that especially was kick ass.  I doubt I will come here on any other night cause I'm afraid any other night would just get me disappointed and I certainly don't want to ruin my expectations from this spot.    Not sure if the items below or prices are still accurate but it is what it was when I went about a year ago.  And it was KICK ASS!!!  Honestly, I would come to Vegas just for this.  But only available on Sundays so if you are in just for the weekend, maybe stay an extra day or two so you can try Ra on Sunday Nights....    Alot of Variety.  Most places only give a couple items for specials but Ra definitely hooks it up....  So their Specials for Sunday Nights are as follows:  Food Specials from 8p - 12 midnight: Edamame $1.50 Flying Fish Eggs $2.50 Flying Fish Roll $5.00 Salmon Nigiri $2.50 California Roll $3.00 Cali Roll w/ Masago $3.50 Spicy Tuna Roll $3.50 Tootsy Maki $3.75 Shrimp Tempura Roll $4.25 Chicken Yakatori $3.50 Scallop Dynamite $3.25 Pork Gyoza $2.75 Coconut Shrimp Tempura $3.75  Drink Specials from 8p - 2a: Warm Sake $1.00 Bud Light $2.25 Well & Call Drinks $3.50 Cold Sake (Hakutsuru) $3.25 Kirin $5.00 Kirin w/ Warm Sake $6.00 Duck Pond Chardonnay $4.50 Duck Pond Merlot $4.50"}
{"text":"Awesome food,  Sushi chef Angel is amazing,  ask him for one of his special creations,  you won't be sorry,  Lauren our waitress was great as well"}
{"text":"The walk over to RA from the Palazzo is painful. Why can't they just build a bridge that cuts diagonal over Las Vegas Blvd? They force you to walk over to the Wynn, then go over another bridge only to finally end up at Fasion Mall -- aka the spaceship. The Apple iPod is heavily advertised here and if you walk from the Palazzo to the mall, you'll hear their theme song about 200 times. \"I tried to do headstands for you...\"  The food at RA never wows me. I ordered the New Zealand Roll and it was interesting! Cream Cheese, Tuna, Scallops, Kiwi, Mangoes, or something like that. It was definitely interesting. The bf didn't enjoy this too much because it was too weird for him but I did! I like weird things.  The red lights in RA make me feel REALLY sleepy so definitely ask for their tea to keep you awake. Our server was pretty attentive to us and nice. She also told us that their green tea was heavily caffeinated and after having said that, we all wanted some to keep us awake."}
{"text":"Great food, love their Banana Maki dessert, little pricey but the quality of food is great. Their service is hit and miss, there have been times when our server has been time efficient and there are times, one might be waiting for 20-30 minutes to get their food whether the restaurant is packed or not. So, hopefully you will be visiting when they are quick with their orders ;)"}
{"text":"Alright, I really don't like to leave negative reviews, but tonight leaves me no choice. Really, there were 2-3 things that were really \"wrong\", but for us, they were biggies....   1. The menus were REALLY DIRTY. I understand that people touch them with dirty hands, but please, wipe them down. It is one of the first things we touch, and it doesn't give us a warm fuzzy feeling about the cleanliness of the rest of the meal/place if the first thing we experience is someone else's food /grime... Yuck.  2.  When our sushi items began to arrive, we realized that we didn't have individual plates to eat from, so we waited for our waiter to return and asked for plates to which he replied \"we are running low on those right now, I will try to bring some out when we get some out of the dishwasher\".... Ummm... This is a restaurant... How do you run out of plates??? I accept that it was a Friday night at 7:00, but there was no wait outside, and plenty of open tables inside the restaurant... This one confuses me... P.S... We NEVER got plates.  3. I won't say our waiter was terrible, but... He was certainly not great.. our glasses ran EMPTY a few times (more than once) and he was just lacking any measure of desire to be there at all.   We are longstanding Ahwatukee residents (20+ Years) and have visited this restaurant many times. Service had always been average, but tonight... The No Plate thing just really stuck with me.  Just because you are one of the few Sushi games locally doesn't mean that if you slack, people will continue to come back.   Just saying..."}
{"text":"The good: Restaurant was clean.  The bad: The sushi was just okay. Not great and didn't seem fresh at all.  The ugly: The management plays Eminem music (rap) over the loudspeaker and the songs are XXX rated with the \"F\" bomb flying every other word and the typically demeaning words about women. We complained about how offensive the music was and the manager simply shrugged his shoulders and stated: \"The corporate office picks our music for us and we don't control it.\"   Well they may not be able to \"change the channel\" but mister we sure can! Sake Bombers is a much better restaurant and always has fresh sushi. My only regret is that we took a chance eating here on our Valentine's evening. Regrettable but not repeatable. We saw several families eating there and they were visibly offended by the poor taste in music that this establishment forces upon its patrons.   Follow my advice: Go eat at Sake Bombers and leave the Stale Sushi Sexist Rappers to fend for themselves!   Peace out!"}
{"text":"Marcella mirrelles is the shit give her a lot of tip $$$ she works hard and super deserves it."}
{"text":"Frat-Boy Sushi house.  Bland, Annoying, Rude."}
{"text":"Not sure about the negative reviews here. Great prices, awesome toro. Happy hour is a complete steal by any standards. I've gotten out of this place before and felt like I had just pulled off a heist. The chefs prepare the Negiri and rolls to perfection. The bartenders pour generously and are pretty quick unless the place is packed. Even so, they're always around to wave down for that next round of Saki Bombers. Oh.. and try the peach or flavored Saki. Not too bad with a Kirin Light."}
{"text":"With Ra being the only sushi restaurant near our hotel, this was definitely a place we wanted to check out when we were suddenly bit by the sushi bug. Once we walked in, I immediately loved the atmosphere. All the hanging red orbs brightened up the otherwise dark room.  The hostess was very inviting and made us feel right at home. My girlfriend and I ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll, which is alright. I wasn't much of a fan of the crispy piece on top due to that fact that it got stuck on in my teeth and didn't add any flavor. On the other hand, we also ordered the crispy onion albacore which was delicious. I also really like how they plate their food. The presentation was beautiful and makes me not want to eat it and instead, frame it on my wall. The happy hour wasn't that great and prices for some rolls were pretty up there, especially for the Viva Las Vegas roll which didn't do anything for me.  Sadly for my friend, he was duped by the server that took care of us. When asking what we good, the server insisted that the Asian crispy tacos were amazing and would highly recommend it. Keep in mind my friend eats anything and everything...even cheap Uni from Kula sushi.  When he got his order, he absolutely hated it. I'm not sure if it was just him but for a recommendation, I would expect the server to offer an item to appeal to everyone.  Presentation, hostess, and atmosphere was definitely a plus. Server recommendation, sushi, and the price is a hit and miss."}
{"text":"This place has really amazing sushi. We came here twice during our visit for the 10 PM happy hour where everything is much cheaper for the rolls."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and decided to visit this location after work with some coworkers after a little apprehension...I mean c'mon...fresh seafood in Arizona where there isn't any real bodies of water around...  did someone say bubble guts?!? O.x  The food itself was only food only ...ok....in the sense that nothing special but not horribly done wrong.  We came during the happy hour which was a major +1 for the spot!  The ceviche and short ribs were decent, ok portion and flavor, not overly fatty cuts of ribs.  The rolls here are wack...but then again any avid sushiya patron doesn't order \"rolls\" to begin with. Kinda on the small side and lacked any special flavor and only reason they were order was because the happy hour deal and I needed something to soak up the draaaanks!   Overall the saving grace was the happy hour + hot waitresses working (Thus 4 stars...if not so hot  waitresses feel free to subtract .5-1 stars)  oh and for those who happen to give a fuark they honor 4square check ins free edamame or miso soup. another +1"}
{"text":"This location is my favorite - and not necessarily for the food, but for the atmosphere. Of all the Ra's I've been to in the Valley, this place has the nicest servers.   Now, as a California native, I've had not just good, but great sushi - and although Ra isn't up there, it's pretty darn decent for Arizona. Reverse happy hour is the best time to go because you can get a lot for a little. The only complaint I have about Ra in general is that you're not allowed to do tradtional sake bombs - you know, with the chopsticks - yet other Japanese restaurants let you. Oh well, can't win 'em all!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the Valley for about 5 years now, and when this location opened, I was quite excited since it's closer to my home. The service is pretty good, and the sushi isn't bad, but I personally prefer the Ra on Mill Ave. Definitely come in for reverse happy hour - you can get a lot at really good prices.  And as others have stated... it's Arizona, you're not going to find sushi as great as other places. But for what it's worth, especially here in AZ, it's really not that bad,"}
{"text":"Pineapple cream cheese wontons!!! Love the Las Vegas rolls, edamame, and rock shrimp :)  Who doesn't love saki with Kirin light?"}
{"text":"4 stars am I crazy? Well maybe but that has nothing to do with it. I would almost give this place 5 stars but it didn't blow my mind with amazing food that was the best I have ever eaten. But I am tempted. The other reason I don't give it 5 stars is it would invalidate all of my other 5 star reviews. Yes is it a chain. Boo. But it is good. I have never been to RA before. I have seen them everywhere of course and heard people rank on them but feel it is slightly unjustified. My girlfriend had a $20 half Birthday gift certificate that you get when you sign up for their club and it is halfway to your Birthday. That is cool. A nice treat 6 months away from your Birthday and you are not trying to run to 10 different places on your Birthday trying to get free stuff. When we got there the restaurant is very nice. Nice décor. Which I'm sure is corporate mandated and in every restaurant but still nice. There were a few other people most sitting outside because of the nice weather. We picked inside and were immediately seated at a nice booth. The hostess was very nice and so was the server. Our drinks were always full and she checked on us regularly. The service was very good. The food came out fairly quickly too. We ordered some pork Gyoza (pot sticker). I love them I could eat at ton of them. They do have great Happy Hour specials and I definitely recommend coming during Happy Hour which is from 3pm to 7pm Monday thru Saturday. Plenty of time to come in after work and fill up on some great food. Then we ordered 3 rolls. Vegas, Philly and Caterpillar. Everything tasted very fresh and was prepared very well. We decided to order one more roll a Dagon roll. It was also very good and came out pretty quick. Now was this the best sushi I have ever had no but it was very fresh and tasted excellent. Every roll was very good plus the service was excellent as well. When you have to flag down someone to get something or wait a long time for someone to check on you or bring you a check it is a nice change when you get good service even if it is at a chain. So all of that combined is why this place gets 4 stars from me. Almost 5 if I wanted piss everyone off and rip a hole in the space-time continuum. We will definitely be back especially during Happy Hour and when they send out coupons. After it was all said and done even without the discount the bill was only about $10 more then we spend at an all you can eat place. I will gladly spend the extra $10 to get quality food and great service and we had all we could eat too."}
{"text":"Worst customer service experience, the place is dirty and very dark. The bathroom smelled bad and the bus boys (at least I think it was the bus boy) was walking around with the silverware's in his back pocket. Had a very quiet server who took about 20 mins bringing our drinks and when she got to our table she spilt them all over me. Though I don't think it was her fault because like I said the place is super dark. It took a few mins for anyone to come clean up our table and finally the manager came out. When the bill came, they charged us full price not even a hook up on the ice tea that spilled all over my pants! Worst place ever, not worth it. I will never come back here. Food was okay, so you all get 1 star, I wish there was an option for no stars!"}
{"text":"Good sushi restaurant.   +1 for sushi happy hour.   Pretty much stuffed for 23 bucks. Needs a larger variety on the happy hour menu. I had to keep ordering the same thing over to get full, but at a great deal. I would go back again for a Dunch (dinner-lunch) during happy hour."}
{"text":"Happy about having Saturday happy hour! Rolls are great. Haven't had a bad meal. Been to this location a few times, service could improve with speed (bringing the check) but overall good and I'll be back for happy hour, as regular drink prices are high."}
{"text":"RA is the bomb for Happy Hour! So reasonable. Their food is amazing and their presentation fantastic. They have Vegetarian options as well. Only caveat is it is always packed then, so you'll need to go early to get a table or two seats! They also have Reverse Happy Hour 10 pm - Midnight, Mon - Sat :)"}
{"text":"We all know this place is a franchise. I don't want to be one, but it is.   That brings it way down in my eyes, but besides that I can't find anything wrong with this place.. in fact the food is good, the place looks good, and their Happy Hour menu is great. If not Happy Hour, this place becomes a fairly standard sushi place, from a price perspective - but on happy hour they have good food for fairly cheap. And anyone that knows my thrifty self knows that I enjoy a good Happy Hour deal.   The service was good. The waitress hovered a little too much for my liking, and in despite of this excessive hovering showed a little low attention to detail. Good thing the food quality is good. We tried a little of everything from their Happy Hour Menu and taste-wise it was delicious and enjoyed by everybody in our party.   I haven't been to any other RA franchise partner locations, but this one is big and nice. I mean I really was surprised in a pleasant way. I wouldn't call this place intimate - but it still has many redeeming features."}
{"text":"I'm not a sushi snob - in fact, being a pretty strict vegetarian for the past four years, I'd never tried sushi except for the California and avocado rolls.  Real sushi is quite a different experience.    The ambience was pretty mod - I liked the colored glass ball lights hanging from the ceiling.  The waitstaff was friendly but (and?) I felt like I'd walked into a modeling agency by mistake.    We went to Ra on a Friday or Saturday night, on the earlier side, and there were less than half a dozen tables occupied.  We sat at the sushi bar and had the following: - yellowfin tuna -shrimp  -California roll -New Zealand roll -sake Sangria  Overall, it was a fun and tasty experience.  The sake Sangria went really well with the food.  The yellowfin tuna was okay, the shrimp was yummy, but the New Zealand rolls took the cake - smoked salmon and cream cheese (which I know makes sushi freaks cringe) on the inside, pine nuts, slices of fresh kiwi (!), and an eel-mango drizzle over the top.  WHOA!  Pretty cool.  I'm not saying it's authentic sushi (I honestly have no idea), but it sure was good (and fresh).  I would go back but would check out other sushi places first."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Our waiter Sara was a total angel. We were bummed out because we love the Shrimp Pineapple salad but today they ran out of Nuts. My mom was upset and she totally took care of us. The service here is the BEST in Las Vegas. Sara went above and beyond to assist us, and I cannot begin to tell you how amazing  the manager Ortal was. RA Sushi is a must everytime in Vegas"}
{"text":"This is just another good sushi place in Vegas. I would've given it 5 stars but there isn't anything really special about this place. Sushi is sushi when it's fresh. Service was a little slow and it wasn't even packed. It's a convenient place to eat though after shopping so that's pretty much the only reason why I go."}
{"text":"Very unique rolls and flavors.  I was there for lunch so I did a bento box and split a roll with my dining partner.  The bento box was okay.  Terriaki chicken, and there wasn't enogh terriaki sauce, but still had good flavor.  The service was friendly and the outdoor seating was covered so it was a comfortable temperature and good people watching.  I would probably go off the strip for sushi in the future, but this hit the spot for our stop at Fashion show."}
{"text":"The food was only okay (not great, one of the rolls fell apart) but the service was horrible.  The bartender had zero personality or service skills but he liked to touch his beard a lot (hello health dept!). I had to ask for ginger and wasabi.....then I had to ask for the little bowls you mix it in. Didn't bring us water, brought the bill before we received all our food."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here with about 5min left to spare of their happy hour. I ordered their spicy salmon roll which turned out to be decent enough. My friend ordered 3 other rolls, she was satisfied. Our waiter was nice and also a cutie. He hooked it up with free soup. We also ordered teriyaki chicken, vegetables were yummy but the chicken was dry."}
{"text":"I love this place for happy hour. I have come here a few times. It's a hit or miss. Just depends on the day and the waiter. I have had some experiences that could be a 10/10 and some that were a 1/10. Overall, not bad. Cheap prices. And the Vegas Rolls are always on point."}
{"text":"Shishito Peppers is a MUST! These little bites of heaven were so flavorful with just the right amount of heat. The spicy shrimp soup was also very good. It had a kick to it for sure."}
{"text":"Hipster vibe like a dance club which is expected in Vegas.  The sushi however is mediocre and very thinly sliced so you don't get that much sushi.  The rolls were not memorable.  The miso soup didn't have seaweed or tofu which I thought was weird.  I wasn't there for happy hour, maybe the lower prices would have made the food taste better given the other great reviews?"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in rush or I have friends visitng in Vegas, I take them here. Their service is great, the food is fresh and innovative, the staff is friendly and quick, the venue is clean and decorated like a sportsbar on one side, and fine dining on the other. They have two happy hours, one in the day from 3-7pm and a late night happy hour. I always order the RA'ckin Shrimp and Viva Las Vegas Roll. Sunday nights is when the venue gets exciting."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best. Almost every \"specialty\" roll is crab mix and cream cheese based, so there is almost no variation whatsoever. If you're looking for serious and unique speciality rolls, this is not the spot for you. However, if you're looking for basic American sushi (or California rolls) with a slight Mexican twist, this is a good place try."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a trendy place with loud music and good people watching, this is a great place to go. The sushi bar is enormous, the decor is cool, the music is rockin'.    But if you're looking for great sushi, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Im in contest prep at the moment for my bodybuilding show. I felt bad when the steamed broccoli came out in soy sauce because I can only eat it plain. The waitress was sweet enough to bring it back and get me a plain order. The inside is dimly lit, but it is a comfortable environment."}
{"text":"I like to consider myself a bit of a sushi connoisseur and let me tell you RA is one of my favorite places. Although their service is not always up to par but they do have a fantastic happy hour and a new deal on Wednesday's that let's you pick 4 items for $30 dollars. What a steal! Especially for their regular prices on their sushi which usually range in the pricey zone."}
{"text":"We seriously LOVE this place.  We'll pick this place almost over any other restaraunt in the valley.  For one the suishi is excellent and prices are amazing! Suishi is better than Kona Grill and price is way better! Gotta try the raw quail eggs!  Music is a bit loud FYI"}
{"text":"First off, i live and die for sushi! i love it! i try different sushi places all the time! But RA falls short in my eyes! I do not feel like there is anything special with RA, it was just in the middle for me! it wasn't good! And it wasn't bad! it was just whatever! However the service when we went was awful! We went during the happy hour on a Monday night and it was packed! It took about an hour to get our food! An another 20 minutes to get our Check after we had already given our server our credit card! It was just too slow and my drink did not get refilled one time! After that last experience i am not sure if i will ever go back!"}
{"text":"Limited menu is only the start of their problems.. The rice was under seasoned and hard.. Sushi chef skills resemble a third grade craft project. The fish cuts where off and pressed till all all moisture was sucked from the fish...just bad and stay away!"}
{"text":"Great food and great environment. My girlfriend and I have been to this place about 10 times and it has been great each time. Tonight we had the shittiest server. Some bald head guy that thought he was bad ass. He walked away while I was trying to give a order, and he also passed by us like we weren't even there. This guy was the worst server I've ever had. He made us feel like we did something wrong for asking for extra sauce or some water. This guy sucks!"}
{"text":"This sushi bar is awesome! We sat outside in the patio area and It's right by the mall across the street from The Wynn hotel and casino. Their sashimi is very good and my favorite! Everything was so fresh! The employees were very attentive considering how busy they were. We're definitely going back."}
{"text":"I love this place, and they're open pretty late for those late night sushi cravings :)"}
{"text":"6pm on a Saturday night..not crowded at all.  Sat at the bar and watched the NHL playoffs.  The spicy edamame was excellent, and all sashimi was fresh.  Nice presentation!"}
{"text":"Having been a server for years and having come from Oklahoma and Texas, I'm normally disappointed by the quality of many restaurants' service. However, I'm currently being served at Ra sushi by Madison -a classy, considerate,  polite, and articulate bartender who has a degree in journalism. Come here and give her a big tip!"}
{"text":"Never again... if they had a 0 star I would give it. I am from California and I love sushi. This place didn't even have the happy greeting you get when you enter a REAL sushi bar.  Over priced sushi, small  rolls, slow service and we went on a Sunday  in the late afternoon  and it was pretty dead.   Good for: Nothing"}
{"text":"Great spot to go to for some sushi in Tempe, AZ. You're right on Mill Avenue and what better than a few sake bombs and sushi before your night begins. Lots of nice looking college people around and great place to meet some people. RA sushi is the West Coast sushi chain and   Service: Great staff. Everyone here is super friendly and mostly accomodating. We got the only guy server there out of 4 and jokingly said, \"Can we have her serve us?\" and the guy said, \"Sure thing\" without any offense. We told him we were joking and he just laughed and took our order. That's how chillaxed people are here.  Food: I usually come here with a few people and always order a bit too much. But hey, you have to try a little of everything. So what the heck. I can't complain one bit about the food. Its all good and probably the best in AZ considering you're in the middle of the desert and eating raw fish.   Drinks: Sapporo and/or Asahi + sake = SAKE BOMB! Get it!   Overall:  Probably the best spot for sushi in AZ. Great place with a great atmosphere. What more do you want?"}
{"text":"Great sushi for every taste. The patio is a great place to sit and we enjoyed the happy hour immensely."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best way to go for RA. crazy good prices make you forget about all the other faults of this restaurant. the music is too loud, I am all for loud music but it becomes obnoxious.  they have ok service, only have had a bad experience once but ive never been blown away by the service at RA.  Seriously though, hit RA up for happy hour."}
{"text":"these guys know what's up, too. I love this place's waitresses."}
{"text":"We came here because we were excited about their extensive yet reasonably priced happy hour menu. Unfortunately, after eating here, that's the only positive I can think of.   The two of us ordered quite a bit: salmon nigiri, pineapple cheese wonton, short ribs, sweet onion salmon, crispy onion albacore, and kaisen ceviche. The waitress accidentally got us one instead of three nigiri so it came out in two orders. The salmon quality was mediocre, but each order didn't even look like it came from the same restaurant. Different cut, different portion, one with wasabi, one without. Just very concerning sign of quality. Both the sweet onion salmon & crispy onion albacore were sliced so small you could barely see the fish in the marinade. The short ribs and pineapple cheese wonton were nothing special, but also very small. The kaisen ceviche was the best dish, but it was clearly not real ceviche as the seafood was so well done it was obvious it was cooked beforehand instead of made with raw seafood. The portions were so modest we ended up ordering dessert as well, which was pretty mediocre as well.   I generally don't like to write about service, but it was just so blatantly bad here. We were seated at a table with place settings yet wasn't even cleaned. They were confused about which server was ours. Waitress confused our order. She spilled beer on our table, laughed it off and didn't even apologized. Later she would clear our dishes while putting other customers drinks on our table. And the restroom looked and smelled like it wasn't cleaned all day.   Summary: very disappointed after spending nearly $60 for 2 while getting mediocre food with skimpy portions and subpar service."}
{"text":"This place outlasted my marriage and for good reasons. The location is great, the service and food are consistently awesome and the prices are pretty stellar for being smack in the middle of tourist traffic.   Sweet prices on drinks for happy hour (that goes from 3p-6p most days). My only issue is the new happy hour food menu is limited from what it once was and doesn't have many vegetarian/vegan options.   Nice sake selection, many you'll want to sip cold. And bonus...patio seating."}
{"text":"Went to RA Sushi today for lunch. The place was empty but clean and the service was good that's why this review has two stars... As for the sushi rolls I've had better tasting sushi from my grocery store.  We ordered two california rolls, Rainbow Roll, a salmon and lobster roll and a supreme tempura roll (may be called something different). No matter what they are called when you order sushi from a place like this at the prices you are paying at this place you expect them to be rolled fresh when you order them. All of the rolls were previously rolled and refrigerated. The rice was cold and hard and the taste was very bland. The Wasabi was very bland and was not spicy at all and almost brown in color. For almost $100 including tax and tip I'd rather eat somewhere else. Will I return? No"}
{"text":"This place has a decent Happy Hour but that is really all its good for.  Get there early so you and friends can actually sit together and put back whatever liquor and sushi you can before 7pm and prepare yourself to get going to the next hot spot.  Not a big fan of the lighting in there either as they dim it so much it almost makes you pass out when its still early.  The specials during HH are what really make this place any good, there does seem to be a lot of DB's floating around there as well.  I will continue to still hit this place up for HH occasionally but you won't see me there any other time."}
{"text":"I usually only go to one sushi restaurant but my friend and I were shopping and wanted to try something new. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked this place! We went during happy hour and they had some great deals. The chicken wings were delicious and the shrimp tempura roll wasn't bad. (I'm very picky)   I was shocked that they were so dead around 5pm on the strip. There were only a couple other people in the restaurant while we were there. The service was fast and the decor was very cute! I would definitely go back for their happy hour! You really can't beat the prices!"}
{"text":"Okay, going here for dinner was the best choice I made our entire Vegas trip. We had been craving sushi and decided it was definitely going to be on our agenda. We were staying at the Wynn/Encore and one of the restaurants there literally charged $28 for a rainbow roll. No thanks! So we took the short walk across the street to RA and it blew our expectations out of the water. - Service was amazing! Everyone was so nice, food came out super fast! The greatest experience ever. - They have a killer happy hour! Rolls, appetizers and food are on there. Don't sleep on the viva Las Vegas roll. - The ambience was great! Super trendy and comfortable place. I was happy with our choice before our food even came out. - Everything we had tasted amazing. Can't beat that And here's my favorite part.. we had 2 sakes, a beer, an appetizer, and 3 rolls for a grand total of $48! You cannot beat that.   This will be a regular stop on all of our Vegas trips. Also, this restaurant is located right on the outside of the fashion show mall so that's a plus for shoppers :)"}
{"text":"Server wasn't good. Dropped a sushi plate and didn't refill our water.  But the sushi was good.  Get the ultimate shrimp tempura and ask for the tuna raw instead of seared.  By far the best one we ordered between 8 rolls and everyone agreed."}
{"text":"Love this place. I started going to RA when I was in college in Tempe, Arizona. Each RA has a unique vibe to it, but same quality sushi.   ...and, I know what you are thinking...sushi, in the desert? Trust and believe, it is worth a stop. It's inexpensive, really good, inventive, and fast. I bring people [co-workers and friends] here every time we go to Vegas, and no one has been disappointed. My co-workers and I even turned the dining room into a dance floor the last time we were there.   If it is a cool enough night, get some friends together, sit on the patio [which overlooks The Strip], get some saki bombers, sushi, and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Their service is extremely slow and Vegas roll was horrible .. No tuna inside the roll ,and not good as they usually do in other RA locations. Manager didn't even come to our table to ask how was our service . I'm not coming back here!!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday where they had happy hour from 8pm-11pm  ordered: crunchy calamari roll 3/5 rainbow roll 4/5 \"Ra\"kin shrimp 5/5 pork gyoza 3/5 spicy salmon roll 4/5 total bill was $28.11(tip excluded)  Service was good, our waitress Jackie did a good job at giving my bf and I ample time to choose what we wanted and making sure our drinks were full. The place was a bit too dark for my liking.  Do come here for their happy hour, it'll save you $$$ and this is a legit place to grab some sushi."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for my friend Renee's birthday.  Got there around 5:45pm and it was already packed.  Left my name with the Host up front and took a number, waited for over 30 minutes for a table, but it was totally worth it.  Our server (Robyn) was great, she was very knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  The prices were okay, since I went during Happy Hour time, it was cheaper.  Make sure you plan your trip early if you decide to go there next time.  The best time to go if during lunch-time (12pm - 3pm) if you don't care about the costs."}
{"text":"We were a party of 5 - came in around happy hour/early dinner. Getting a table (in a half empty restaurant) took forever, no one wanted to seat us?? Anyways, we ordered SEVERAL items; vegetable tempura - soggy, 2 California rolls - sloppiness doesn't even begin to cover it, 2 Tempura prawn roll - pretty good but showed up AFTER all our other food was gone and plates cleared. We also ordered 2 weird chicken kebab appetizers - really really bad, chicken tasted so bland and watery, yuck. The \"crazy monkey\" roll was actually very tasty and by far the best prepared item we ordered. Anyhow, the only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars instead of 2 is because after being seated our waitress was prompt and friendly - even though I think SHE forgot to put in our 2 orders of tempura prawn rolls and then blamed the kitchen. We won't be back - definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Had a quick dinner here one night well on the strip. The menu is a bit confusing. Out of the 3 things I ordered, only 1 actually was a roll, I thought all 3 were. The drinks were pretty yummy. The bartender was super friendly. Next time I am going to make sure that I ask about the items on the menu instead of just assuming."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow service,  quality of food not good. Couldn't even get our drink order right,  water with lemon. Waitress freaked out when I asked about changing a roll by one ingredient. Seriously worried about the quality of the of my food. Never coming back.  Update good arrived an hour later. No good. Disgusting... definitely never coming back . Poooooor service"}
{"text":"Nothing to brag about. I have had better sushi at a hole in the wall. The price by no mean comes close to the quality. I use to go here for lunch when I lived in Vegas but it was mostly out of convenience than the food. The service for my one dinner here was terrible and it wasn't the company I was with it was the horribly slow movement of the kitchen and the wait staff. Forty-Five minutes for an order of salmon sushi, really? How about the 20 minutes after that when I got my main dish, dear god I spent more time waiting than eating. This chain needs to rethink their employment strategy for this location."}
{"text":"Definitely not my favorite Sushi in the valley but the Happy Hour is way way worth it if you need a Sushi fix and your pockets are dead.  The Gyoza is delish.  The Rolls and Nigiri on the Happy Hour menu suffice and do the trick.  Sake/Beer specials put the cap on.  Even though it was packed there is plenty of seating available.  People watching rivals the zoo.    My favorite spot is at the bar in the cocktail area.  Best and quickest service assured.  Then again, I sit at the bar everywhere.    Happy Hour, yes.  Un-Happy Hour, no."}
{"text":"Great place to get awesome quality sushi down on mill. A little pricey for a college student but if you wanna splurge on a great California roll this the place to do it!"}
{"text":"RA Sushi is seriously mediocre. You pay the prices for the meal but it doesn't even come out looking that appetizing. My boyfriend found some hairs in his Viva Las Vegas rolls that was awkward. Out waitress was nice but she couldn't detect when we were don't eating. Out plates were finished and she asked multiple times if she could fill up our waters. Like check pls. I have to say, the pineapple cream cheese wonton chips are my favorite dish here. But everything has such a small portion. Originally $8 the just 4 little wontons. Should be At Least 6 I would say. I would only come again if I couldn't afford to dine at another better sushi restaurant"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the viva Las Vegas dish, Gyoza, and spicy yellowish roll. Loved all of it but the roll. Bartender was super sweet and friendly! Great happy hour!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and it's always after work so I am always hungry.  I've tried:  - the Gojira roll - TOTALLY LOVE THE PINEAPPLE CHEESE WONTONS!!!! (Surprised there is no review from anybody about these, I always get two when I go, everytime and the slaw it's served on is to die for too) - I had a Lobster roll topped with Mango (I believe it was 9.50) which was one of the best rolls I've had. - Chicken Yakatori (Yummmmm!!) - Pork Goyza (Yummm!!)  The Sea Monkey is a pretty good drink too. (My only complaint is that the Blue Fin drink listed on the website http://www.rasushi.com/ Is not on the menu in the Las Vegas location and it's not like I'm not gonna remember what's in it so they can make it for me!)  Go on SIN Sunday!! Totally save you a ton of money and the prices aren't bad considering it's on the strip.  This place is up there with Tiger Sushi (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tiger-sushi-las-vegas #1 in town!) and Ichiza."}
{"text":"Ra is the place to come for happy hour.  The options are delicious, prices are reasonable, and you will not go away hungry.  Best part is sitting outside and people watching on the strip.  They will customize any sushi you order (leaving out any ingredients you might not want), and the waitress even came and told me that the chef had asked if I had a food allergy because I did not want sesame seeds on my sushi, and the salad I had ordered had sesame oil as an ingredient.  That is great customer service.  I have been coming here for happy hour/dinner for years. My favorite is the pork potstickers but everything I have tried is top notch."}
{"text":"Great food! A bit pricey but worth every penny  The service is laid back so make sure you have the time to wait and be patient the servers and host are very young. They try"}
{"text":"This place was decent... not for the sushi because that was mediocre. But for the atmosphere and the drinks, great for a dinner date. I used to work in South Scottsdale not to far from here, so it was easy to meet up with my BF here and have a few drinks and some sushi... nice casual vibe..."}
{"text":"Bummed... we really love this place & the food but we recently went to dinner as a family and I went to change my 4 month old son and there is no changing table in the restroom.  Probably won't be coming back to eat bc it's such an inconvenience to have to take him to the car to change him or elsewhere. Makes me feel like it's not very family friendly."}
{"text":"Happy hour is great! Food is good. We shared the calamari tempura and a few rolls. The server was very attentive. The hostess was friendly. I recommend this place anytime. It's somewhat pricey when not on happy hour but definitely good."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Ra in years. I have no excuse other than I simply forgot about it, but I'm glad I rediscovered their happy hour! My friend KJ and I were looking for a place for late night eats, which is much easier said than done in Gilbert. I also had some dog-mom guilt for leaving my lab puppy at home all day, so I was also on the hunt for a dog friendly patio. For the record, dogs aren't actually allowed on the patio at Ra, but they do have some tables flush against the gate and you can have your pup hang out right next to your table. Fair warning though, the space between the bars is pretty wide; enough for my 60 pound dog to sneak through. They were even sweet enough to bring him some water without me asking.   The happy hour menu is awesome. There are at least two dozen food items and a dozen drinks. I had a gin + ginger beer, the seared tuna, and garlic ponzu yellowtail - all for under $20. The fish tasted fresh and there were six good sized pieces of each. I don't know what sauce comes with the tuna, but it was so good I could've licked the plate. I'll definitely be back to try some of the rolls!"}
{"text":"We came to Ra at Fashion Show Mall for reverse happy hour on a Wednesday night. It was pretty slow, and we were able to snag a two top on the patio for some prime people watching. Our server was prompt and friendly without being overbearing. Even though it was slow, our sushi order took about 20-30 minutes to come out. We had a few drinks and didn't really mind the wait, but our server brought us some free edamame anyways. I've been to a few different Ra restaurants in the Phoenix area, but this was by far the best experience.   Reverse happy hour runs from 10-close during the week. There were dozens of drinks and food options on the menu, ranging from $2.75-7.75 per item. We had some pretty standard rolls (spicy salmon, shrimp, yellowtail). They weren't anything mind blowing, but hit the spot and were decently priced. The yakitori chicken came with three skewers; the teriyaki sauce was bland, and the meat was a little tough. Same for the seared ahi tapas.  Bottom line: our bill came to just under $50 on 5 items, two vodka drinks and two bud lights. Not the place for sushi connoisseurs, but a good inexpensive alternative to pricey restaurants on the strip. The people watching is superb."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from a chain sushi restaurant but the food was surprisingly good. I love sashimi and only ordered a small amount because of my trepidation. I wish I'd ordered more because it was very fresh and tasty. The rolls I sampled were the Tootsy Maki, Spicy Tuna, and Vegas roll. Spicy tuna was my favorite but the Tootsy maki was also really good. I love anything with eel sauce. My husband loved the Vegas maki but there was just too much going on in it. I did love the fried lotus chips on top. Seriously, why don't they sell those things by the bag? The cocktails were just okay. Go for the happy hour because the prices are ridiculous afterward. $8.50 for a California roll? I think not! The service was extremely fast. Our sushi came out with our drinks. The wait staff were very friendly and answered all of my questions thoroughly. And, I enjoyed sitting out on the patio even though the view was of a parking lot. I'll definitely go back for more...but only before 7pm!"}
{"text":"was here in the middle of March '10. moderate prices for moderate sushi. i've been to the one in Scottsdale a couple years back. that one had really good sushi and a lively ambiance. probably better off heading up to that one instead."}
{"text":"I really should have left a review prior to now. Don't be mad at me.  RA at Fashion Show mall has been a staple happy hour spot for me since 2010! Happy hour pricing is from 3pm-7pm and then again late night. The happy hour prices are so cheap and our group consumes an insane amount of food for a really reasonable tab.   We usually order the following from the happy hour menu:  -sake -beer (Kirin Light) -wine -RAckin shrimp -seaweed salad -cucumber salad -edamame -salmon nigiri (at least 5 orders) -spicy yellowtail roll -Las Vegas roll -vegetable tempura -sesame chicken wings -short ribs -tempura fried ice cream (not on happy hour menu, but so amazing with chocolate and cinnamon you have to order it anyway)  Regular time (non-happy hour) pricing is comparable to the rest of the sushi places found on the strip, but the happy hour here cannot be beat. Granted, service can be slow at times but as long as you're not in a rush, RA at Fashion Show is definitely enjoyable."}
{"text":"Good service and ambiance during lunch. Had quite a few signature rolls which were not impressive and looked more like a regular roll. I would not return."}
{"text":"Horrible non-Japanese sushi, over-priced, with ear-splitting ghetto rap music. If you're 21 years old, and love crap food, this place is for you. Otherwise, head to Kyoto up the street...Japanese owned, and great prices."}
{"text":"Geo(George) was wonderful with my daughter. I rate a server first by how they treat my kids and by how they treat me. I don't want a server that talks down to, around, or above my but one who treats my kids like a respected customer who happens to be nine years old. We also got to see Geo treat two other much younger and much more out going girls very respectfully, as well, so it was Geo that was exceptional - not *just* my kid"}
{"text":"I'm giving it four stars solely on the sushi and the drinks.   The women's bathroom smelled like pure pee and really dirty . My boyfriend told me the men's was just as bad. Our waiter was very odd. He asked us if we were ready to order right when we just got the menus. Then when we said we needed a minute to look at the menu he gave us 25 minutes...   the Japanese Moscow Mule was excellent nice and strong. The rolls were great. Love the happy hour pricing (3p-7p) even on a Saturday. Highly recommend the Viva La Vegas roll as well as the rainbow roll. The spicy tuna was okay.  I'd come back and give them another chance.   We also waited about 20 minutes after eating for our check and then another 20 for him to pick up the card to pay for the meal and the restaurant wasn't even that busy. I'm just glad the food and drinks were good."}
{"text":"I've been here once. Couldn't justify coming back. The sushi dishes are rather small and dry and not very fresh. The prices are alright, should be lower for the quality that they are. The atmosphere is crazy loud, definitely not family oriented."}
{"text":"The drinks are mah-velous!!! And the sushi is fresh, never \"fishy\" smelling or tasting. The new California Dream Roll was awesome. It was a tempura style California roll, nice and warm, with a cool crab salad in the middle. And, with reverse Happy Hour starting at 10pm, the prices were very reasonable.  The service was pleasant, prompt and accurate.   Overall, the experience was very nice and worth revisiting."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of huge chain restaurants. I will readily admit that.  In fact, I think this may be the first one I've reviewed. I've been to Olive Garden, Chili's, etc., but I've never given enough of a crap about my experiences there--good OR bad--to write about it. I'm only reviewing this one because it popped up on my list of places I'd been when I checked in on Yelp today, and I did have a pretty irritating experience there last month. So here we are.  We came to the Scottsdale Ra a couple of years ago when I was in town for my cousin's wedding. The experience wasn't bad, as I recall, but it also wasn't great. Overall, pretty forgettable. My sister and her husband seemed to really like it, though, so when we found out we'd be back in the area this spring, they wanted to be sure we ate here for lunch one day.  The vegetarian selections here are slim. And that's me being nice. There's edamame and a tofu appetizer, but those aren't really substantial enough to be considered a meal. The one \"vegetarian\" roll I saw came covered in eel sauce. I mentioned to the server that I was a veg and asked if the eel sauce actually contained real eel. His response?  \"Yeah, but it's only like 4% eel. The rest is water and sugar. It's really good.\"  Well, thank goodness I'm only a 96% vegetarian, right? After explaining that ANY fish would be a nonstarter for me, I asked if the eel sauce could be left off.  \"Do you just want it, like, on the side?\"  No, person who clearly doesn't understand the concept of vegetarianism. I don't want any. At all. Ever. We finally got things figured out and he marked me down for a veggie tempura roll, minus the offending liquid fishparts.  So when the food came out covered in brown sauce, I was kinda surprised. I thought we'd covered that. The food runner, of course, had no idea, but as soon as the server saw it he realized the mistake and took it back. Which is to his credit, because at least he noticed. However, I did have to wait an extra fifteen minutes for my roll to come out while my travel companions started in on theirs.  When it did finally arrive--without sauce this time--my server also brought me a coupon for a free appetizer at any Ra location. There's one in our area here in Kansas, so I was at least vaguely interested in using it. However, upon closer inspection, I realized it was expired by about a month. Points for trying, I suppose.  I think next time I'll definitely suggest finding a local place to try, since having the resources of a large chain obviously doesn't mean the experience or the food will be anything to write home about."}
{"text":"Came in for mine and my sister's half birthday certificate... 40 worth of free food... But I'm afraid we got almost free type of food... Maybe its just me because my sister and man enjoyed it.  A lot of the sushi we ordered were pretty and fullof sauces... I would probably liked it better with plain or less saucy sushi.  Our server was very nice tho :)  The atmosphere is like the dark romatic feelbut when we got to our table it smelled like old carpet or old rag that was probably used to clean the table -.- ( faded away after sitting there for a while tho)  FYI if you have Half birthday certificates... They def won't let you use it for HH prices but you can get the specialty rolls you normally wouldn't get coz they're too pricey.   Anyways... It wasn't a horrible experience or anything. Super grateful for my $20 certificate :)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at how good the sushi was here. We enjoyed it so much we came here twice during our 3 day trip to Vegas. What was really tasty was the uni. Good texture and tasted really fresh. We ordered a ton of other rolls and nigiri, everything was really good. The prices were much cheaper than anything you could hope to find in any of the casinos.  One thing you need to know is that they don't give you wasabi unless you request it. I thought this was really strange but wasn't an issue. Good find in Vegas for our sushi fix. Oh they're also open late night post clubbing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I are from Memphis, TN. We are here on business and absolutely love sushi. We were told this is the best place here so we tried it out. We loved it! We had a few \"specialty\" drinks and just sushi. We tried the hot mess, rackin shrimp and Philadelphia roll. The Philly we could of passed in(much better at home) but the others were absolutely delicious. Would definitely come back but I think they are very much overpriced."}
{"text":"The A-Ok that comes up when you hit three stars just about sums it up. I am a little spoiled having lived in Miami where sushi is really reasonable and amazing. For AZ... Ra is about average. I really only think about going there when they send me an email deal. Last night they had 15% off the entire check because it was their anniversary. The sushi is good. The appetizers are unique and probably my favorite part. I love their pineapple wontons. What I can't seem to get past here is the sticker shock. I always get the bill and wonder how I spend $50. They are really generous with their \"half birthday\" deal. They email you a $20 certificate when it is halfway to your birthday which is way more than most restaurants give.   So I will continue to go about 3 times a year. I always really enjoy it and I love the atmosphere. I just can't really afford a $50 meal all the time. I miss Miami where the same meal would have been half the price! The cost of living in the desert and loving sushi!"}
{"text":"I absolutely could not say it better than Alicia B.  \"I'm only concerned with the fish.\"  Check out her review for the most succinct bottom line on Ra.  I can't say it as well or in so few words - so I will just tell you what happened to me.  Seriously - I went there for the sushi and trust me, I was alone in that endeavor.  Everyone else was there for the scene.  What has been said here is true.  It is loud music, loud people, over the top decor.  We sat at the sushi counter, not because they were busy, but mostly because we couldn't get the host's attention.  The \"chef\" (and I use that term generously here) who was in front of us had completely no idea what he was doing.  Granted he said he was new there, but he took our order sheet and handed it off to the next guy because he said he couldn't handle it.  I can understand \"I'm still learning the ropes.\" so I cut him some slack and tried to make conversation.  \"So, do you like to make sushi at home.\"  \"No, I've never made sushi before, but I like to eat it.\"  You do not get to stand in front of customers, profess you know nothing, and cut cream cheese for a 1/2 hour.  Yuck!  We ordered: toro sashimi, hamachi sashimi, saba oshi sushi, uni sashimi, some crispy-spicy tuna thing, and some veggie tempura.    The saba oshi sushi completely threw them.  Why even have a special order line if you can only make the 7 or 8 standard items you have on the menu?  So the \"experienced chef\" to whom the menu was handed said, \"you want saba sushi\"?  I wanted to be clear so I said, \"Mackerel OSHI sushi, you know, box pressed Mackerel.\"  I got the \"Oh, ok\" but I was skeptical.  Then he kept asking me crazy questions, \"You want that with rice? Are you sure you just want Mackerel? No other fish with that?\"  I offered to just let him give us Saba Nigiri, much simpler.  If you don't have the box or you can't do oshi sushi, no problem - I gave him every out.  We basically ended up with Saba Don - nothing like what I ordered and no willingness to admit none of them had any idea what they were doing.  And it was way sub par saba at that.  So, they were out of the toro.  No apologies, just \"We don't have that.\" We tried to order the scallop dish as a substitute, but that never came.  In the end, all the better I figure.  The crispy-spicy tuna thing was almost ok.  Except the spicy was mostly jalapeno and just totally wrong for the dish and the crispy stuck to my teeth.  The tempura was the only thing that was close to good.  It was too thickly battered though and didn't come close to tempura at its finest.  The uni was gross.  I took one bite and left it there.  It was slimy and not fresh at all.  I didn't realize when I walked in, but I really shouldn't have ordered it.  This is not the place anyone who cares about fresh fish really eats.  The uni was never going to be a big seller or any good at a place like this.  This is where people go to drink silly fru fru drinks, eat exorbitant rolls that don't even resemble sushi, and to have their conversation drown out by loud music so they don't even have to think.  OK on top of it being a horrible experience, the fish just sucked.  Really, terrible quality, terrible selection.    I came here on a recommendation, but can not believe I didn't check Yelp first.  Shame on me.  I will not be fooled again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Sushi Spot by far. I love the Vegas rolls. No other Sushi Spot out the straw for their Vegas rolls and I love the Wednesday special the customer service here is great but I really love sitting at the sushi bar I'm not sure what his name is but he is definitely one of my favorite Sushi chefs. He tells me about all of the different roles he's making even if they're not for me and then he also lets me sample here and there which I love he personally invited me and my friend to their anniversary and we sure did show up and showed out I am definitely a regular at rawe and I need to start checking in more oh and not to mention they have the best reverse happy hour hands down"}
{"text":"Great lunch. I went here with a friend from work because of a BOGO coupon he had. The lunch was fantastic. I had a rice bowl with raw fish on top with mixed seeweed and mushrooms mixed in. The flavor was just right with enough savory sauce and sticky sweet rice. The fish on top was perfectly cut into cubes and plenty of it. I liked it a lot."}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been here several times. One time, the service was terrible. The rest of the times, though, have been great.  If you sign up on their email list they'll send you lots and lots of deals.  The sushi is tasty.  I'm a huge fan of their specialty rolls. They also have great happy hour specials: Mon-Fri, 3pm-7pm Mon-Sat, 10pm-Close Sun, 8pm-Close  Finally, I really like how you can call ahead to put your name on the list, as it tends to get pretty busy.    Overall, if you're looking for some good sushi, I'd say give RA Sushi a try! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting in another sushi restaurant right now. Do you want to know why?  My wife and I went to RA. We were greeted and sat promptly by the hostess.  It took a few minutes for our waiter to take our drink order. It seemed a little peculiar, because the lunch rush had already passed. There were only four tables to attend to, and I saw that there were at least 3 servers on the floor.  After waiting 10 minutes for our hot tea and iced tea, I told myself that I would get up and leave of he doesn't arrive with our drinks after two minutes. Sure enough, he didn't return within that time. (Which I think is pretty unacceptable.) Who knows how long it would have taken to get our drinks?  I didn't even want to imagine how long it would have taken to get our actual food.   So here I am, at a sushi restaurant a couple of miles away. I received my drink order two minutes after being seated. They're is easily 3X the amount of patrons here, and their service is still better."}
{"text":"Reverse sushi happy hour was pretty delicious. Best sushi in town? No. But for the happy hour prices the food and service were most agreeable. There was also pretty good people watching and a DJ, who was a tad bit intrusive with his volume. Overall a good place to go on a Sunday night to help you forget that it's a school night."}

{"text":"SO disappointing! The service was horrible; it took forever to get anything. The server brought us out food....finally, without chop sticks or a bowl for the soy sauce. 2 of the four rolls we got were pretty good; the other 2 tasted fishy. I would definitely NOT recommend it!"}
{"text":"I live right by here and have been going here for many years now. Its great to go for girls night, date night, or just a group of friends. I've never been disappointed by service or food here! Drinks are always on point. If you have enough room for it order the ice cream cinnamon tempura. Thank me later!"}
{"text":"This is really nice but I think that everyone would enjoy this restaurant it is wonderful and great views it's in the heart of Vegas"}
{"text":"I stopped in to get a quick bite of Sushi here at RA and found the food to be pretty good.  My server, John was a bit busy but he made sure to keep my drink full.  I would recommend RA Sushi to anyone looking for a good Sushi restaurant at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I've always liked ra sushi, their food is amazing, however, when I came to this location with my wife, I was truly disappointed of their service, this was a few months back though, as I walked in, the manager didn't even bother greeting us in (the bald guy), I had to look for a table myself, one of the waitresses saw us and didn't even say \"hi\" or \"I will be right with you guys\" horrible, we stood up and walked out obviously, on the way out, I encountered a waitress and told her about it and she did not apologize or anything, terrible service, specially from the so called \"manager\"."}
{"text":"Today's visit to RA Sushi was wonderful! The happy hour specials are great, and the service staff is very friendly. The atmosphere is relaxing yet modern. The restrooms are well designed yet the men's restroom needed some serious attention. Dark lighting shouldn't be used to keep appearance.    Cynthia was our waitress and had amazing guest service technique. GREAT JOB CYNTHIA!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The decor is unsavory, the chefs are a joke, the portions are laughable, the food is terrible, It must be hard for people who aren't use to good sushi and rolls to understand, well it must be easy to fool their clientele. Bored housewives the spoiled teenagers the loud jocks and the obnoxious college students. I also can make terrible food give it to someone starving and call it first class cuisine. But I will not charge you an arm and a leg to eat my disasters. The chefs sneering at customization of anything they make, while management flirts with the younger waitresses and customers what a disgusting display. If your from the coast and your visiting your friends here in the valley and they offer this place up as a choice, politely pass unless you want to have bad visit."}
{"text":"One of many trips to RA Sushi but a first in Las Vegas. Was pleasantly surprised that RA was right across from where we were staying at the Palazzo. Came here during happy hour with my best friend and her mom who is Korean and is very picky about her sushi. We had the gyoza, spicy chicken wings, edemame, the Viva Las Vegas roll and more i just don't remember cause I was already drunk and then we ordered large beers with hot sake. I was DONE-ZO. I love RA and this particular location is one of the best next to downtown San Diego. I will keep coming back to you RA. Muah."}
{"text":"I have experienced good and bad here.  Sometimes I feel like the fish is not fresh and it scares me.  I like to go out to unwind with friends, have a few cocktails, something to eat and want to talk.  That is why people go out to get together and talk.  However, you cannot do this here.  The music is so loud you cannot hear yourself think.  Why do they need it so loud?  If I am going dancing, maybe...but to converse!!! Wow, horrific  you have to scream at the waitresses and bartenders not good for me."}
{"text":"I make an effort to come here every time I'm in town.  It is so worth it the HH menu has really good portions of food for the price.  I recommend the calamari and the sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Food is good but service is lacking. Can find a waitress for the life of me to pay the bill and get out of this place."}
{"text":"I have been to this location a couple of times now and it is just not that good. The sushi is pretty expensive and twice I have receive pieces that didn't look quite right. I never eat \"ify\" sushi. The rainbow roll was pretty good but the sashimi was questionable. The Miso is awesome and so are soy beans. Over all the service is always pretty good, however I did have one crappy waitress. She was rude and slightly condescending. I was not dressed to impress.... had a impromptu lunch date with a girlfriend and apparently I did not belong there. FYI I'm not ugly or a slob, but my hair was in a pony tail and I wasn't wearing makeup! So shoot me! Point is, she was rude and I didn't feel welcome. The hostess was very nice though. I think I am going to avoid this Ra location from now on."}
{"text":"The sushi was good (I only tried 2 rolls). The wine selection was GREAT! The service was good, and the price was a bit high. Over all I enjoyed my experience at RA. The only 2 negatives were, the women's bathroom was being remodeled so I had to used the men's....eeeewh, and it was FREEZING! For some reason the AC was on at 8 pm at night and it was cold outside. We asked them to turn it off because it was blowing right on our table and no one ever did. Since I was literally shivering I did not get to enjoy my experience as much as I would have liked. I really just wanted to go relax and chat with my friends after work, but I think I burned just as many calories sitting there freezing my ars off as I would have if I had gone to the gym. I'll go back when it is hot outside again."}
{"text":"I'm from LA and I've tried the one in Marina del Rey all the time. Last night I was pleased to know that all their dishes are the same and taste amazing :) . Service was also a plus. Friendly hostess as well as our server. One thing I didn't like is that our server seem to be busy and we would see him rare but he did check up on us when he could so is understandable. Thank you for the experience."}
{"text":"I've been to RA in the past & haven't been highly impressed with it but we thought we would check out this location. We asked for a table for two & were taken to the back of the restaurant. After stepping to that side, I immediately got a strong stench of something disgusting. It was so bad that we got a seat back up in the front area.  We had gone in for happy hour & yes, the prices are really high. I ended up ordering the RA'kin Shrimp & the Pineapple Cream Cheese Wontons. I was ok with the wontons but saw that the shrimp were not deveined. Considering the price (especially at almost $12 at regular price) I think that they should've taken the time to devein them. I spent a little bit less than $20 for just those two items with tax and tip.  Worth it? Definitely not. Will we return? Nope."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh fish. soft like butter, nice happy hour offer-sake $2. Fast service and that during CES!"}
{"text":"Part 2 of the business trip.  Dinner with the sales team.  We always have fun when out on the road and this was no exception.   The need for sushi is somtimes primal.  This was one of those nights.    Starting off with happy hour prices that were awesome we easily knocked down three bottles of Sake while deciding what treats to order.  We ordered a tableful of great sushi- alot of variety and had a great time.  The one disappointment was that the sushi just didn't have enough spice.  Not nearly enough heat.  The staff was excellent and very helpful.    I would recommend Ra.  The atmosphere alone- great music and fun staff is a good reason to go."}
{"text":"The bartender snubbed me and I sat waiting to place a drink order for 15 minutes while he described everything on the menu and made drinks for two guys that walked in after me. First off that was rude. Secondly, I work in the industry so I am patient, but I have no patience for a bartender that won't even acknowledge me. The girl bartenders are always attentive and I'm here all the time. Guess I won't be coming for a weekday happy hour ever again. I'm at saltys now and had a drink and food within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Average sushi for the average joe.  Haven't had bad food here, it just doesn't strike me as particularly memorable.  I've liked the wasabi mashed potatoes and the tootsie roll.  It is a chain and feels and tastes as such.  Service is spotty at times, and there always seems to be a wait.    As the only sushi joint in the ASU area - I think it does well because of the monopoly.  I don't think it would do as well if there were other choices in the area.  Will go back if I'm in the area.  But with the Scottsdale sushi bars (Kyoto and Sakana in particular) just a few miles away - why bother?"}
{"text":"We loved this place!!!!  It was our first time going to Las Vegas last week and on the first night there we were craving something Asian so we yelped that and up popped this awesome sushi bar. It's a mix of regular Japanese rolls and some Asian Fusion appetizers/side dishes. It was the best decision ever! So good, in fact, that we decided to go there twice in our three day stay in Vegas. Located right on The Strip at the Fashion Show Mall, it was so easy to find. The greatest thing about this place was its happy hour is from 3-7pm, perfect for dinner time. From $2 side dishes, to $4 regular rolls and $7 dollar special rolls, $30 was enough to fill our tummies with delicious yummy-ness. I also personally loved the atmosphere, its red lights and tasteful decorations plus top 40 music playing in the background, complements the Vegas style perfectly. I just can't express enough how awesome this place was, when I go back with my friends in the summer, I am definitely bringing them there!!  Some must tries at this restaurant are: shishito peppers, Viva Las Vegas Roll, spicy tuna roll, garlic sugar snow pea, tootsi roll, and scallop dynamite, 5/6 of them were on the wonderful happy hour menu!"}
{"text":"Fun place to go unwind for happy hour with coworkers, family, and friends. I've been going here for over 5 years and it's been a steady great experience.  Some happy hours can get loud, but nothing that is unbearable. The staff that works there is fun, professional, and get you what you need fast.  I'd really recommend this to anyone looking to get out or is from out of town, and is looking for some great sushi. Keep up the great sushi RA, as well as the fun customer service and I'll see you all again."}
{"text":"Great Maki sushi, the rolls are very tasty and the portions are generous.  Some place you have to get 3 rolls to fill up, here I would say just 2.  Miso is decent, and the atmosphere is energetic.  I am not a huge fan of Sashimi so I am not sure of their selection in that area.  Happy Hour is a good deal here."}
{"text":"Yeah, Ra is a chain, but it's consistent quality of food, drinks and service keeps me coming back.   It's right across the street from work, and the happy hour (4p-7p) here is ridiculous. You get a Sake Bomber for $7. Two of those and you'll be in great shape to hit up the clubs that are within walking distance. A perfect spot to pre-game.  They have several appetizers on the menu during HH, in addition to some of the sushi rolls.  It's not the best sushi ever, but it does the job.  I've only been here on Friday nights, but around 6PM, they have an in-house DJ that isn't afraid to play some dub step, house and whatnot.  This is THE spot for happy hour if you are in the area.  If you want a great breakdown of the HH, check out my buddy Elnino's review. He has it mapped out."}
{"text":"I am extremely pleased with this place. I am a sushi junkie and I LOVE LOVE LOVE some good sushi. First time going here was about a little over a month ago as a date night. I remember the waiter being super nice and attentive, he made sure to get out orders in before happy hour and checked on us before happy hour ended. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE if you ask me.   Tonight I went alone, I sat at the sushi bar and the waitress said she would be right with me and a minute goes by and the chef behind the counter immediately notices me and asks if I've been helped, I said well the waitress said she would be right back, then he grabbed what appeared to be a manager and he takes my order and I told him please don't get her in trouble it was just a few minutes and I was fine with waiting. She comes back right as I finish my order. No big deal but I just loved that right away, one person saw I wasn't helped and said something, regardless of what was exchanged between the waitress and I. That's GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!   Not only did I notice their service but I too noticed that they have amazing fresh sushi, this would probably be the only place I feel more comfortable with trying new rolls or different fish, because I know I am getting quality and fresh! Exactly what sushi is all about. This place isn't too bad on costs I mean if you want good sushi, it's not always going to be super cheap but they are reasonable. And their happy hour, is great! Get in before 6 and you're golden, not too harsh on your wallet.   I just moved up the street and this place will in fact be my sushi place when I crave some, I just became a regular!"}
{"text":"This is the all time worst place to eat sushi.  No matter where I go to consume some sushi, the most common thing we sushi loves complain about is RA.  The waitstaff is rude there, the music is \"THUMPING\", the clientelle is stuck up and irritating.  The food is not good either.  They commonly even mess up the Sake.  I always like my food spicy.  The last time I was there, I advised them to make my tuna roll spicy and instructed them on how to do it.  The guy just looked at me and laughed and walked away to talk to some girls who were hostesses or something.  The food finally arrived and it was gross.  I had to kill the taste with a beer and the server took forever to notice me.  I can't even finish this review I am getting so irritated!!"}
{"text":"I've never really cared much for this place at all, but they've got a great happy hour and the food is mostly decent. I've never gotten sick here or anything, which is a plus, considering I was always freaked out by getting sushi in a landlocked state. The service is mostly horrible, but the space is sorta nice and there's never a wait for a table. I rounded up to 3 stars because of good date nights with the boy here, but I wouldn't go out of my way to pay this place a visit. The rolls are below average, so if you're a true sushi fan, keep it simple with nigiri and simple rolls."}
{"text":"I always get the shaft at sushi joints as I don't eat fish. Not at RA! My most recent discovery is the vegetable tempura roll. It is the best sushi roll I have ever had in my entire existence. With lots of vegetables tempura fried to perfection accompanied by a light sauce and doused in wasabi by yours truly. Delicious and still relatively light for fried vegetables. The other rolls look creative and are always satisfactory to my fellow diners.   The happy hour is a must. Specially priced apps ranging from $2-$6 with a variety of options. Sake AND a large beer for $5. Even at regular price of $7 the sake and 22 oz Japanese brew is a good value. They also have martinis and mixed drinks on special. I recently went for lunch and invested $7 for a Bento box of main dish (selection variety), salad, soup and a potsticker. No substitutions so I donated the meat potsticker to my lunch date. Fast, cheap lunch without losing quality.   Service is always friendly. The place is constantly busy so make reservations or be prepared to wait. It can be loud but great for large groups or a spot for two at the bar.    Lunch, happy hour or dinner. RA is great!"}
{"text":"What can I say about the sushi bar. It was extremely delicious the servers were always there for you and the food was delicious.  when I go to Las Vegas I will definitely return to the sushi place. The prices are good and the drinks are amazing."}
{"text":"I am writing another review because not only was the experience we had at the restaurant absolutely unacceptable but the experience since then has been the WORST! They write a response on my review asking me to email them, so I do. Haven't heard a single thing back. I have called the corporate office multiple times and have never been able to speak to anyone and have not had a single call back. I am blown away at this company's actions and how they handle their customers. If you want to show me how much you care and want to hope to regain my business, then don't act like this, don't ignore my calls and emails."}
{"text":"We love Sushi, so we frequent various local RA and Stingray establishments, regularly.  The RA Ahwatukee location is convenient to us and good for Happy Hour cocktails and food specials.  I find that while the bar staff seems cordial enough, they are not the most outgoing or friendliest we've experienced in other comparable spots.  However, the food here is the absolute standard of what a traditional RA establishment provides - Good.  Our favorite thing to order is the 'Tunacado'...This dish features perfectly seared Ahi Tuna surrounded by delicious slices of avocado & a side of the most amazing creamy Ponzu sauce under the sun!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi restaurant on the strip that's not over priced! Loved their specialty rolls.  Very fresh and unique combinations. Service was good as well.  It's a trendy atmosphere, but the only downside was the music was too loud like I was in a night club.  I could hardly carry a conversation.  Music was good, just too loud.    Definetly a place to go that's not over priced like others on the strip."}
{"text":"My parents and I made a visit to this place at the Fashion Show Mall on the Las Vegas Strip because I had wanted to go to the Disney store they had there.   Service: The service was great, we had a girl named Ashley who was a sweetheart and seemed very knowledgeable about the menu, answering the questions we had about the menu.   Food: I had the nutty grilled chicken salad, which I really enjoyed! It had edamame in it which I really like in my salads. My dad had the sushi dinner platter, which I had some of as well. It definitely wasn't the best sushi we've had, but it was okay. My mom is not a fan of sushi, so she had the teriyaki chicken bowl and she also ordered vegetable tempura, which was not overly battered and oily, so that was great! To drink, I decided to try the iced green tea but had to have it taken back because it was intolerable. It tasted like seaweed, honestly. That's what my dad said, I thought it was hilarious, and I agreed.  Atmosphere: The atmosphere is quite  trendy, it's pretty dark inside too. The one thing that stands out the most about this place is that it's super LOUD. Don't come here if you want to chat with whoever you're with.   Overall, it was an okay experience, and I'd give it another shot if presented with the opportunity next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Their happy hour does have some great deals but it's really because there really is nothing special about their sushi.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I would have been even more disappointed if I had paid regular price for some of these rolls.    I'm gonna give you the food highlight of the night and major food pitfall on the night.  Starting with the positive, they had a very good tempura fried ice cream (green tea I think) that was cut nicely into 4 equal sections for the table to share.  On the other end, we orderd a toro dish that was the worst toro I've had.  We got 5 pieces for like $20 and to top that, the one in the middle looks as it had been thawed and sitting out for about half a day.  It was completely dark colored and unappetizing compared to the rest of the pieces and none were particularly good to begin with.  Go elsewhere if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Tonight I had wonderful service from my bartender Isaac! He always goes above and beyond, ra is my favorite place to finish off a hard days work with a sake bomb and sushi! Thank you Isaac for making my experience great and appetizing. I'll be back..."}
{"text":"Came here for a double date once and it was awful. Both the date and the food. Service was slow and inattentive, the food was sub-par, and the sushi was luke-warmish which is just wrong when it comes to raw fish. The place was loud and obnoxious. Way too much like the other crap along Mill Avenue. I tried the neighboring location just up Scottsdale Road and it was definitely much better. If you hate yourself and want to get sick, go here. If not, keep walking."}
{"text":"Ordered Vegas rolls, rainbow roll, and garlic citrus yellowtail. A mix of good and not so good. I've been to Ra sushi several times in the past but the Vegas rolls this time around wasn't a winner. The sliced lotus root chip at the top of the rolls were stale and unbreakable. If you like, you're more than welcome to break a tooth or two trying to bite into the chip. Try playing it at the casino! House wins on that.   On the flip, rainbow roll is always good. And, even better, the garlic citrus yellowtail was a new one for me and made up for those stale chips! :)  Service was decent because the waitress didn't fill one of our cup of waters when it was clearly empty. We live in AZ so I think a refill on water would be nice!   Overall, some good and some bad. We will call it even!! ;)"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick sushi roll the other night. Very disappointing. Sat at the sushi bar, service was nice, sushi chef was nice, hostess was nice; Sushi however was very disappointing. Ordered a rainbow roll and the lobster roll. The rainbow roll had little tiny pieces of fish on top of it and the roll itself was skinny.  Not even sure if the lobster roll had actual Lobster in it and again topped with tiny pieces of shrimp. The rolls were dry and tasteless. The sushi bar itself was kind of dirty, not having been wiped off properly, you could literally see the streaks of the dirty rag that was used to wipe the space."}
{"text":"Good basic sushi.  This location is less dark/hip/annoyingly loud than the one on Mill in Tempe.  I like it and I'd go back."}
{"text":"The service and atmosphere was great, however, the sushi rolls were not as fresh as I thought it would be. I got the salmon skin roll and the salmon seemed very soggy to me. Not the best, just OKAY."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, it was dead but service was on point. My only problem, small case if food poisoning. This had to have come from the tuna toro bc it was the only thing my guest and I shared.. Other than that, it was great experience! I'm not mean enough to slam them for it, I was eating raw food and maybe the fish ate poison itself.. Poor thing :/"}
{"text":"I like the Ra.  Trendy.  Good modern music.  Cool big red ball lights.  It feels good in there.  Huge sushi bar with good dude sushi chefs.  I sat down at the sushi bar and, as per my standard, told the sushi chef to make me what he likes.  It's best this way.  You don't know if the Ahi is fresh, hopefully he does.  And wow, I was a little surprised.  Usually \"cool\" sushi places don't have the greatest fish.  Sure, good looking rolls, but avoid the pieces.  Ra didn't just not disappoint, it impressed.  Great food.  I think the best the chef came up with was a yellow tail sashimi.  Second was a roll that got dipped in a \"pesto-ish\" sauce.  Good times all around."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating Sushi and I really enjoyed it!  Now i've got to try more!"}
{"text":"Came here on my last trip to Vegas, the rolls are pretty good, tasted pretty fresh.   Our server was great too, we ordered a roll and she told us we could get it but in her opinion it was not that good, and she suggested another roll that had a lot of the same ingredients on it, and she was right it was really good. We asked her for one more suggestion a little later and that was good too. It felt like she really cared and was not just working for a tip.     The location is great too, it's at the Fashion Show Mall, which is right next to Treasure Island."}
{"text":"Our first night and place in Vegas for our trip and we hit a home run!  RA Sushi was highly recommended to my wife as a great place to eat and they did not disappoint.  Although we had reservations we decided to sit at the bar and got a couple different rolls.  Each one was amazing especially the Scallop and Shrimp roll I had all to myself.    Not much to say here except the atmosphere was great, the service was fantastic, and we even got a free roll because it was my Birthday and free Edamame because we check in our Foursquare!  If I was a frequent Vegas visitor I would go get Sushi here in a heartbeat!   Bravo!"}
{"text":"When you come to RA at this location you know you are going to get good, top quality Sushi and great service. The young lady that helped us provided us with good suggestions and timely service.  As for the food, what can I say, after I finished the last piece or sushi, I still wanted more. Our appetizer was great also. I would suggest the miso soup paired with the tempura vegetables.   The sushi was the next best thing. I was fresh, well prepared, and the gave us generous portions. We had basic sushi, (cucumber roll, California roll, and the Philly roll), yet they were as yummy as can be.  Lastly our dessert! My wife enjoyed the green tea ice cream, while I devoured a banana split concoction with fresh fruits, ice cream, and tasty glazes.  I would recommend you try this place. Indeed the price was good too."}
{"text":"Went there on a Tue night, it was fairly full but not crazy busy. Ordered the dynamite roll and 2 different nigiris, together with a sake. The server warned me that the sushi bar was backed up and my order might take a while. Fair enough, I wasn't in a hurry. The dynamite roll arrived within 5 minutes, awesomely quick, and it was delicious. By the time I was finished with my dynamite roll I still haven't received water or my sake. I flagged down the server, who finally brought me some water. After about 30 minutes the first 2 pieces of nigiri (salmon) arrived, but without wasabi. The salmon was not the freshest. After about another 10 minutes, the second order of nigiri arrived (eel) and by that time I also got my sake. The eel was good. Summary: - service was unsatisfactory. It wasn't the long wait for my food, but the fact that I repeatedly had to flag down my server to get my stuff - raw fish was not fresh - cooked items were good - prices are good I probably won't be back but give some other sushi bars in Las Vegas a try."}
{"text":"For those of you who like RA, my apologies up front. We keep thinking that the food will get better or the quality will improve....sad to say not.  Pork dumplings have an overload of spices and more in the sauce.  Not a good pick for kiddos.  (Never seen it anywhere else).  Edamame was good....just perfectly salted.  (Why the 2 stars).  Sushi was: Tuna: I guess u have to ask for wasabi to be placed between rice and fish.  I thought it normally has some.  My bad!  But the tuna was so fatty we could not chew it.  Next! Salmon: stinky and way oily.  Not sure what happened here?!? Crab: it's imitation but it doesn't need to be the loser of a race between a lobster and an airplane!  (See pics!)  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Gilbert location is nicely decorated.  I like to sit outside on the patio during the nice weather because it's too loud inside.  The hostess was terrible - not inviting at all! - but our waitress was awesome.  The food is so-so.  It's hard to screw up miso soup, edamame and veggie rolls.  But the veggie tempura was terrible!  Dripping in oil and the dipping sauce was tasteless - or maybe overpowered by the taste of the oil.  There are DEFINITELY better sushi places but the prices are reasonable.  It's chain, keep your expectations low."}
{"text":"Ever had that friend that you haven't seen in years,  but when you get together it's like no time has passed? That's Ra sushi to me.  Back in the day (like 10 years ago) when I worked at the mall,  my girls and I would frequent this joint and get wasted on mango hot sake and viva Las Vegas rolls.  Fast forward to now,  in a sushi reunion,  I'm back on the Ra bandwagon! Not much has changed,  except for some great menu additions,  and less of a Club vibe (no more dj both).   What you get at Ra that you can't get at the 1000 other amazing sushi places in town is a super cool vibe,  sexy lounge like restaurant atmosphere,  a full bar with innovative cocktails and full beer list, and really good sushi for a great price.  It's like the best mix of local meets strip.  Perfect for date night.  Perfect for meeting the girls.  Just perfect.    It's located on the outside of Fashionshow Mall on the Las Vegas Blvd side in between kona grill and el Segundo. They're open late and also do an amazing lunch special.  I love coming here for lunch and getting a bento box,  or for happy hour cocktails and some sushi dinner.    The staff is amazing.  The bartender Adam is funny and great at slangin' drinks.  My server Jorge was so attentive and made our experience great! The GM of the restaurant Ken even came out and checked on our table.  Such a good time and amazing food.    So get your butts away from Chinatown and all-you-can-eat sushi for like one second and reintroduce yourself to Ra."}
{"text":"THE best happy hour that I have found! (Weekdays 4-7pm) The food is really good and the drinks better! $10 for a huge Tsunami punch (think Voodoo's What The Witch Dr ordered drink - in Size, but better tasting) $1 Warm Sake, 3.50 well drinks, 2.75 Bud Light, etc Nice!  The decor is dark and cool, you can also sit outside if you like but nothing beats the inside decor, IMHO."}
{"text":"Good for lunch. They were quick. Food was usual quality for a Japanese fusion place. Server accommodated splitting the check for a party of (4), and the prices for lunch bento box were very good.   Quick for lunch in a pinch"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great.... lovely design and decor, and airy!  The service was excellent....attentive and efficient!  Enjoyed a happy hour there and tried quite a variety of sushi and rolls, as well as a few regular menu items, but nothing really stood out in taste, and it bordered on \"just average\".  Worth giving it another try for all of the other positives!"}
{"text":"Amazing vegetarian sushi! They have a few delicious different options. Also the service there is really great and the prices are really decent, which is surprising since its on the strip! Happy hour is great for cocktails as well."}
{"text":"I think this place needs a dance floor. It is in a nice area, nice shopping center, and it is a very nice looking restaurant. You would think the atmosphere would cater to the typical patron for the neighborhood. However, I felt like I should have been ready for a night out at the club. The music is loud, thumping and just not what I want to hear when trying to enjoy my meal. I have only been to this location 3 times in the last 5 years because of this and the quality of the food.  The sushi is average, not great or noteworthy. I can eat it if someone really wants to dine here, but it is not my first choice. I haven't tried the sashimi, but to be honest, I won't if I think their sushi is mediocre. Most of the time it takes a while to get my sushi and it comes a little more towards room-temperature than I like. It should be chilled.  The service is average as well. You have to yell at your server because the music is loud. Last time I visited was a couple of weeks ago for a birthday. There was 7 of us. One of them ordered a California roll and it was the last thing served. By last thing, I mean the rest of us were almost halfway done with our meals by the time he received his roll. This should have been first out considering the basic prep for this roll.  I honestly don't know how this place stays in business. If you see the same complaints from a large number of (former) patrons, why not change the way you do business? If you have a slew of complaints about the music, turn it down! It's a restaurant, not a club. I don't dine here unless I am with someone who chose it and is adamant about it."}
{"text":"We had the Viva Las Vegas roll which I HIGHLY recommend, as well as the spicy lobster roll and mango roll. All 3 rolls were great, but the waitress failed to tell us there would be a $1 extra charge for each roll for added cream cheese I requested AND another $1 for the roll to be deep fried. So that was a surprise when we got our bill. The service wasn't too friendly, but the sushi was great. I also had the Blushing Geisha drink which was a lemonade, but I do not recommend it for $8."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this place has gone downhill...  The quality of the fish wasn't great across the board and the only roll that was decent was the Viva Las Vegas roll which is fried so a lot of the flavor is covered up. The chicken skewers were undercooked which can lead to food poisoning and everything we ordered was on the bland side. As the happy hour prices go up the food quality goes down.   I used to frequent this location several times a week when I worked at the Wynn and enjoyed it for many years. Tonight's dinner doesn't inspire me to come back.   Service was nice but a tad awkward as our server doesn't like sushi. He kept recommending cooked items and I had to say to him that we are here for the sushi too & this place is called RA Sushi so it's interesting to have hired someone who isn't into raw fish. But my review doesn't reflect this at all. The food wasn't great."}
{"text":"It's alright for my lunch break if it lands during the happy hour.  The atmosphere is nice.  I've yet to be amazed there yet and there is much better sushi joints in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm over this place. Suggestions to gain back previous customers that often frequented but eventually got sick of crappy service and food:  Bring back the paper to write down your orders. No one trusts your waitstaff to get it correct. I'm sure the sushi chefs agree...  Properly train your servers. Make sure they know the menu. For the love of GOD- Hire intelligent people! It's not that difficult to memorize the menu...hell, provide flash cards or something to help them out.   Either always serve wasabi and ginger with all sushi dishes or make sure your waitstaff ALWAYS asks their customers. There is nothing worse than getting sushi without it, and having your waitress walk away without asking if we need anything else. It then takes 5 minutes to flag someone down and that's super annoying.  STOP raising your prices and lowering your quality. No one wants to pay $16.00 for shitty sushi. I'm now opting for simple rolls, not because I'm cheap, but because I don't trust that I'm really getting anything worth more than $5 bucks.   Your specials are atrocious. Who the hell really wants some fruity lemon melon drink with a splash of old cucumber? It's a smack in the face. Either leave it off the menu or provide an enticing drink special.  Perhaps you can take this constructive criticism and make some solid, much needed changes. I've provided too many excuses for this place and enough is enough."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant, they had a great happy hour. We were most impressed with the server Rob. He was very efficient and competent, and when I asked him if I could pay the check, he was very sneaky and slid it to my side so nobody else could get to it. It was awesome. He was rad and made the dining experience Excellent!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi fan and I had no idea where to go because there were so many to choose from . Me , my mom and sister had came to the fashion show mall and happened to walk outside to see what else they had to eat and saw RA. I seen this place before in Cali where I live so we checked out the menu and like what we saw . My mom isn't really a sushi fan like me and my sister but she said she was willing to try it too. We came in , it was pretty crowded on the patio but empty inside so we were seated quickly. Our waiter was great and the food was awesome . One of the rolls I got off happy hour was called a Vegas roll and the other one was a shrimp and chili roll . They both were super good and I def will be back for happy hour to the one near me. But I was sad to find out that you don't get any complimentary edamames like all the other sushi places I been too :("}
{"text":"First and foremost, I don't come here for the Sushi. I come here for the Happy Hour which starts at 4:30pm. Domestic beers are cheap $3 for Bud Light, $5 for imports like Kirin, and Hot Sake is only $2! And when I get really drunk then I will venture into the menu and order the Americanized fusion sushi that always usually contains cream cheese. Why the hell does all the sushi contain cream cheese? RA sushi is to Japanese food as Taco Bell is to Mexican...far from what it's supposed to be.   Get your pre party on here for cheap and get a Las Vegas Roll when you're drunk enough to wanna eat the sushi here. The waitresses were very nice and there was a DJ when I was there.   This place is conveniently located in the Fashion Mall, so you can walk off  the gratuitous amounts of food and alcohol in an A/C filled ambience!"}
{"text":"My first impression of this restaurants was that it looked nice however once we stepped in the building I got an odor that was similar to rats!! It was a disgusting smell that was around the carpet . So we moved to the bar where it stanked less  We ordered a rainbow roll, spicy tempura shrimp roll, and edamame from the happy hour menu. I thought it was going to be great but the Rolls were super small and tasteless and Adding spicy mayo barely helped because the taste was pure mustardy like. The edamame had tons of salt.  Try at your own risk..."}
{"text":"I even do not want give this restaurant one star. There was a terrible smell in the restaurant and I waited for the service for a long time, more than 15 minutes, but no one asked me anything. When I went out of this restaurant, the waiter was rude. I will never introduce anyone go to this restaurant. So bad experience."}
{"text":"Great service! It was our last night of the trip and after the La Reve show, we needed something to eat and heard from a local that she like Bento box here and thought we would give it a try! We were in a sushi kick! We wanted something light as it was later than usual dinner time for us. We ordered the best of the best udon in the whole world--CLAM UDON! Let me tell you, I was in heaven! The broth was creamy and bisque-like and Clams were not from the can! The broth was on a salty side, but I love the saltiness of it! I cleaned the bowl! Sushi were great, we ordered Toro, Sake, Hamachi and the Citrus miso Hamachi was good, but not outstanding, I like the pure form of fish better."}
{"text":"The sushi at this location is so much better than at the other Ra Sushi Bar Restaurants I've been to. I ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll and an assortment of Nigiri. It was all very enjoyable, although the roll is difficult to eat because of how big it is. Regardless, the sushi is tasty. My issue is the fact that the sushi is overpriced for what you receive and the service is not that great. The server must have thought he was running a race today he kept flying by me so quickly and the restaurant was half empty \"everything good?great. okay.\" I didn't even get to order a new drink. He did come back with a new drink at some point later on, in two parts- ice in one glass, tea in the other, so I could put it together myself. Nice. If part of what you are paying for in this place is service you are definitely being gouged. The food I like, but definitely overpriced."}
{"text":"Went to Ra for my son's 18th birthday because he remembered loving it when he was younger. We should have gone somewhere else. It was the biggest waste of money we've spent in a long time.  This place is all about the looks and a hip vibe. NOT about the food and service. My salad was not fresh and my Chicken Yakisoba was drowning is so much sauce it was horrible to eat. My Sea Monkey was good, but then this place is all about the drinks. The rolls were ok but this is not real Sushi. The rice fell apart in the soy sauce - the mark of truly great Sushi is not only the fish, but the rice you put it on top of. Even our old favorite tempura fried ice cream was completely cold (I know it's ice cream but in the past its been warm with a little melting around the edges). This looked and tasted like it was pre-made and thrown in the microwave.   The service was horrendous! Our waitress was attentive at first but then it got busy. She asked me if I had gotten a fork with my salad. I told her no and she said she'd bring one - it never came. She picked up my son's glass from his Virgin Mojito and said she would come right back and clear the plates. She put his glass back down on the table and off she went never coming back to clear our dishes. Another one of the wait staff did. We ordered a second roll and it took 20 minutes to come out. Then she told us she'd put the ice cream in and that it shouldn't be too much longer. At that point she left our check and it took another 15 minutes for dessert to come out.   My husband is furious because we paid $110 for a meal that wasn't worth $20. My son was disappointed and we are NEVER going back. In fact we are so upset we are going to do a redo so he doesn't remember his 18th birthday like this.  All looks and no heart!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent!!! Visited their locations in Atlanta and Vegas; consistently great food, service, and ambiance."}
{"text":"RA Sushi maximizes what Phoenix is capable of doing when it comes to sushi. It picks a specific set of dishes upon which it perfects the craft of. Each piece of sushi ordered stays intact, and, while the fish isn't as fresh as it would be in other cities like Los Angeles or Seattle, it accomplishes what it originally set out to do.  I ordered the Rainbow Roll and then backed it up with a Sapporo. It was a good combination. Sushi has to be defined in terms of its form, notably if it can stay together in one piece when you pick it up with chopsticks. It stayed in one piece, each and every one.  The Sapporo was good too, it's what you expect out of a Japanese standard beer.   As far as the ambiance, the bar is situated on the right as soon as you walk in, and the main dining room is on the left side which is situated with the sushi bar. The windows are full body and give you a view of the shopping center parking lot. Not too glamorous, but in the desert, your options to view things isn't too diverse anyway.  Service was good, they were attentive and mindful of the tone set at our table, so that was good.   Would return, but I don't live in Ahwatukee and only came to meet a friend to discuss business matters. So we'll see."}
{"text":"There are other places in town that are less expensive with better sushi choices, and not as loud, but I had an experience today that inspired me to write here this evening.   I go to Ra (Scottsdale Rd) somewhat frequently for their lunch special which is a good deal: miso soup, yummy salad with addictive ginger dressing, a california roll and four pieces of nigiri. Good stuff. I usually upgrade to a rainbow roll and just pay the difference.   A few months ago I went to a different sushi place in Tempe. I paid with cash and when my change was returned, the server had \"rounded up\" and treated himself to a presumptuous tip (he didn't return my coins). I called the manager over, went home and wrote a bad review on Yelp, tell people not to go to that restaurant and won't return to eat there again.  This afternoon I sat at the sushi bar, had excellent service, good happy hour eats, and good discussion with the young sushi chef. I paid with cash and my Ra server gave me back my change ... minus coins. I immediately got tense and thought \"great, here we go again.\" I called her over to explain. She said that she had rounded-up - in my favor. I counted my bills and saw that she had indeed given me back my change plus a little extra. She said that she didn't have coins, so she just gave me the difference.   I thought that was very cool. I thanked her, and left a big tip. Now I'm writing about my good experience at Ra Sushi on Scottsdale Road and will definitely keep going there.   It's amazing how one little gesture will have such ripples."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and tasty - the calamari was cooked to perfection, the rackin fried shrimp was okay - somewhat over cooked, the garlic edamame was good, had a few of their specialty rolls (Las Vegas, Gojira, Rali Pop) also Philadelphia, California, Dragon, Eel - all were good. The dragon roll was the best tasting, I thought. Also had the mochi ice cream, it's basically what you would buy in the freezer section at the grocery store served on a plate, the serving size was small for the price. The server was very good- attentive and helpful with the recommendations. Only four stars due to the over cooked shrimp and small mochi serving."}
{"text":"Place is cute and servers are nice.  But sushi doesn't taste fresh.  And they skimp on sushli pieces.  So if you aren't a sushi nut like me - you may like it.  For me it's a pass"}
{"text":"My friends and I needed a quick place to eat. We decided to eat at RA because it was right across the street from our hotel. It was almost 3PM. Perfect because Happy Hour was from 3-7.  The drink and sushi specials were relatively under $10 each. I ordered the spicy yellowtail roll and deep fried spicy tuna appetizer. $5 each! I also ordered the salmon nigiri for $2.75. Soo GOOD. Mmm. Drink wise, I got the white wine sake! It was a little on the sour side but it was tolerable.  I liked everything except the rude girl at the front who seated us to our table. Asian girl with the long hair, I SEE YOU."}
{"text":"RA has a great happy hour!  You can eat and drink for an unbeatable price.  There sushi is pretty good. The vibe and service is just okay."}
{"text":"I've been to RA multiple times but never have we received as great as service as we did tonight. Christy our waitress and she was awesome. Great service and had a spunky personality. When you have a server that is personable and attentive, it always makes your dining experience that much better. Way to go Christy! RA, you have a great server on your hands."}
{"text":"Ra has never disappointed me, their happy hour deals are incredible, and their ingredients are always fresh.  The menu is very creative for sushi, especially the dynamite plate."}
{"text":"Stopped in RA after the Super Bowl. After all other sushi locations were closed I decided to come here with friends and I'm glad I did! The ambiance is amazing,the food was amazing and the service from the server with the red hair was excellent! Definitely did not expect to find a place so Modern,clean, and tasty on Mill Ave."}
{"text":"For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go.  RA feels more like a fusion restaurant than anything traditional. In addition to sushi that most people are familiar with, RA also adds twists to many of their rolls. Their famous Viva Las Vegas Roll is great, plated very well, and is part of the Happy Hour menu! The menu is quite unique, and you will not be able to find most of the items on their menu anywhere else (sans the traditional rolls).  Happy Hour is half off select appetizers and rolls, while certain drinks are marked at a set lower price. This is one of the best selling points, but I noticed that it is also one of their caveats. While I was not disappointed during regular hours, I ordered the same roll during Happy Hour, and the roll just didn't seem up to par as during regular hours. I guess they have to meet up with increased demand? Regardless, this doesn't bother me, as the quality is still far above anything else I have tried.  Food: Best place to get sushi on the Strip Drinks: Plentiful, even better during Happy Hour Service: Great If it's busy, you can always walk around the shopping center to kill time. You can't lose by going to RA!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, not a bad place to eat in the MALL the service was good and the happy hour Menu had some nice selections."}
{"text":"I love sushi and sashimi so the happenstance that I had sushi two days in a row was no problem. It gave me a chance to compare the two. Ra is a commercial chain (the other is Echo in Phoenix near Anthem and is not a chain) and I usually go into chain knowing not to expect as much as I do from sole owners. I was pleasantly surprised. Ra has a solid and varied menu, friendly service and quality offerings. Their drink offerings do not measure up and their prices are on the slightly high side but it is a good place to go. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I visited this location a couple weeks ago with some friends, since I had heard good things about RA. My initial impression of the place was pretty good. I liked the decor of the restaurant, and the loud atmosphere is what I was looking for (I mean, Mill Ave on a Friday night...seriously).   As far as the service goes, it was decent. I wasn't impressed with the waiter, but I wasn't thrown into a fit of rage either. So, you know, props. With how busy it was, I wasn't expecting the world's best wait staff anyway.  And then there's the food. One friend and I had various pieces of sushi, which were extremely average. Like, if you could grade this sushi with a C, it would be the largest possible C you could give. And for the high price point, this is really a turn off. My other friend had some kind of mushroom-based soup that was pretty fantastic, though. I regret not buying cauldrons full of the soup."}
{"text":"All in all, it was an ok dinner. I liked the atmosphere, even though it was a bit loud. We started with edamame, which was fresh and hot. A good start.   The sushi roll menu had too many items with crab mix... I think it's their attempt to keep prices down and profits up. There wasn't anything very inventive on the menu, but we found a couple of rolls and some tuna and salmon nigiri to order. The nigiri was ultra fresh and tasty, just not very big. The shrimp tempura roll was ok, and of course came with crab mix. Odd. The beef tenderloin roll sounded better than it was. It lacked flavor and pow.   But, the drinks were good and reasonable. Three stars for the drinks and nigiri."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere.  Yummy mixed drinks, which a lot of sushi/japanese places don't have. I don't do beer or sake, so this was great for me. Decent rolls and the tuna and avocado salad was deeeelisshhh."}
{"text":"NOT SINGLES FRIENDLY! Went here to get a bite before I start work. I ordered 5 servings of nigiri sushi, and one specialty roll. I received ALL of my sushi before I got my warm bottle of Asahi Black or even a glass of water. Which was 28 minutes from when I gave the sushi preparer my order. The sushi preparer was fine but he gave me a bad piece of Surf Clam (it was half disintegrating/rotting. I told him my problem and he gave me two orders of something else. I had no one to complain my service to so I just asked for my check from a busser since I still don't know who my server was.  The check said my server was Carlos but the guy who was taking my order was some white dude. Overall horrible service and what you'd expect from a typical tourist sushi bar. Never again. And telling everyone I know this place is just pure ass.  All the girls that work here are pretty but have zero intelligence and do not bother stepping up when someone is trying to flag them down for an order or help it anything.  Happy valentines day...  Pros: Sushi guy is good prepares them Japanese style (small rice mostly protein) Fixes mistakes on the fly  Cons: Service Service Service Warm beer SERVICE  Overall Unless you look like money, or have some pretty blonde with you, you're better off eating at Stripburger next door or the food court directly above. AVOID THIS PLACE PLEASE"}
{"text":"My overall impression was that this place is average. We got seated right away for dinner and got a table outside. The floor was covered in trash and the plates on the table were a little dirty like they weren't washed well. It wasn't until we were about halfway through our visit that someone came to clean up the trash.   I give them three stars and not less is because our waitress was nice and the sushi itself was pretty good. The price is good for what you get and the drinks we had were very good. They poured them strong and were a good bang for your buck (happy hour). If I were to go back I might choose to sit inside and see if what the ambiance is like in there."}
{"text":"Ate here tonight with some family. Had a party of 8. Service was lacking. Our food took quite a bit of time and even though the restaurant was not packed. Sushi was okay but for the price I would have rather ate somewhere else.   They have no customer service. Basically we ordered and they delivered our food. No one checked to see how we were doing or to even refill our drinks except for the 3 waters at the table. We only ordered a couple rolls & were going to order more if someone ever came back to take our order...they didn't...I also ordered sea weed salad when they had first brought our food to us... That never came.   Go to another sushi restaurant in town. You'll get your food faster and will have better service."}
{"text":"The shrimp tempura and Vegas roll are outstanding and the servers, hostesses and bartenders etc. are typically 8 or 9s at least. All the haters either don't know good sushi, are jealous chicks or perhaps gay."}
{"text":"The sushi is good. However, when I placed the order over the phone, the kind lady told me it will be ready in ten minutes. I live about 15 mins away so I hop in my car as soon as I got off the phone. As I got there, no one greeted me. The workers walked in and out of the restaurant onto their patios to talk to other customers. But did not acknowledge me at all. I waited for about 10-15mins to be noticed. Finally, a worker came up and asked if I needed something. I told her that I placed an order for pick up. And she went to the back to check. Once she returned (5more mins had already passed), she said my order will be ready in 10-15mins. Seriously?! I was told that when I first placed the order over the phone at 11:55pm. So, as I waited my 10-15more mins, I see a cockroach crawl by me! So disgusting! It is 12:35am. I finally have my food. That was the longest \"10 minutes\" ever! I did also look at my food and hardly any steamed vegetables are there! Three sticks of asparagus one slice of squash, 4 rings of bell peppers and a ring of an onion. That's pretty expensive for so little veggies!"}
{"text":"i had dinner their after eating buffet for several days. sushi are pretty good. Didn't find any type of \"very special\" food there."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken teriyaki bowl on lunch special. It was a good cut of meat but the flavor was just okay. I never had green tea before and wont ever get it again. The miso soup did not mesh well at all with my taste buds. If you are a person who likes fluffy odd raw food and interesting flavors this is your place. If your like me and like red meat, grease, and dairy products this IS NOT YOUR PLACE.   My buddy got a bunch of items from the sushi bar and he liked them.   The service was really good and efficient.  You can easily get a better, cheaper, chicken teriyaki bowl from many other places. Don't go here for that!"}
{"text":"Sorry to say but they have the worst sushi I've ever had. Atmosphere is hip mostly for younger crowds.  Way over price!"}
{"text":"First time I have eaten here. Seemed like the waitress was a bit scrabbled. There was five people on a four person table so two people had to sit very close. The service was all over the place. We all got our meal 10 mins apart. Drinks were not filled until we asked for then. We asked for more silverware more happy hour menu more soy sauce more plates... Just begging and begging. The food was good but the service was lacking a lot."}
{"text":"We got there at a very busy time but there was no excuse for getting two of our plates to us real fast and or other place which we ask for twice and were told it was getting prepared was never given to us. We decided we didn't want it because it was a half an hour later and decided to leave. When we got our bill they had charged us twice for something we never even got. Good thing we always check our tab. They took the $23 off of the bill and as we were getting ready to go a waiter came up and gave us our food and we declined it. The manager came and gave us a free appetizer card and told us they compensated us on our check but in reality they just took off the food that we never received."}
{"text":"Solid sushi, innovative Japanese dishes, cool vibe, great people watching, and fresh fresh fish!  Yum!  And for the boys: the waitresses are cuties!"}
{"text":"RA is a very popular sushi restaurant and has a high customer base. The atmosphere is very trendy and fun.     This restaurant is more like a bar and a cool place to have drinks and get together with friends. Unfortunately it is not a very good place to get quality sushi.    The rolls and cuts are small and don't have the quality that some of the more dedicated sushi joints do. Also for what you get the prices are too high.     Fortunately the service is usually pretty good because of it's \"chain-based\" origin and are usually nice.     Also, I like the fact they have a nice patio area for those who want to eat outside and enjoy the weather. The patio still receives good service generally.    Overall I would recommend this place for a fun outing with your friends, but not for a night of good sushi."}
{"text":"The Viva Las Vegas roll was was harder and less flavorful than similar rolls from other sushi restaurants. We weren't served any ginger or wasabi with our sushi. After asking, we still waited several minutes (until all of one roll was gone) to receive a little dab for two rolls.  We dined during happy hour. For the portion and quality of food, it was definitely overpriced. I would be extremely unhappy paying the full price (which I estimate would be $75 for 2 people). Also, I think of happy hour pricing as being better than $1 off $8 drinks.  The spicy shrimp roll was good. The overall size of the rolls seemed a little smaller than usual. Not a lot, like maybe 15-20% smaller. The fried banana with Kahlua is affordable ($5.75) and decent tasting, but it honestly was about 1/3 of a banana.   The aesthetics were pleasing, but it was Very loud. They were playing \"club\" music, which seemed weird for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This was on my list for a while but it let me down. BUT to be fair I didn't order sushi. So I will still give it a second chance.   I went for lunch and got the veggie tempura bento box. It comes with salad, soup, gyoza and whatever entree you order. The soup wasn't super hot (which is always my favorite part about getting soup at these places is how piping hot it always is). The salad was overdressed and soggy, and the tempura was bland. But the gyoza was good!   On top of that service was subpar. Maybe they were just short staffed?   Everything was *fine* but there are too many options out there to go somewhere just *fine* for food."}
{"text":"Oh yum! I wasn't fortunate enough to make any of the happy hours but the Viva Las Vegas roll did not disappoint. We also had a roll that I think was called Crunch Roll.  My friends and I also really enjoyed the music selections. Perhaps the most entertaining part of our dinner though, was just sitting outside. It was such a nice thing to be away from the cold of San Francisco and sitting outside at night wearing a tank top.  It's true the place was a little pricey but not anymore than any good sushi place I have known. And every now and then you just have to splurge. I didn't think it was that bad if you're splitting it with friends as I was. We each paid around $40 each for several rolls, saki, and drinks."}
{"text":"We came here for a few drinks, so I cant speak for the food. Also, im not much of a sushi eater.  The drinks tasted great, so good that I would have thought it was alcohol free if I hadnt known, definitely on the weak side.  My fiance and her friend had the \"60 oz\" fishbowl which in reality looked no larger than 40 oz and also seemed to be a virigin drink honestly.  Also, the waitress wasnt too attentive and the music was so loud I could hardly speak across the table.  Right above the place is \"school of rock\" and the bass from the speakers at that venue were enough to be clearly heard inside of this restaurant and even vibrate the walls. Will I be back? Probably, but only because of the free $20 gift card.....free lunch!"}
{"text":"Great sushi. We always sit at the preparer bar location to watch as our sushi is made. Our server was excellent and talking to the sushi preparer was very interesting. We experimented with a few different dishes and each was delicious."}
{"text":"Why did I come here? I was visiting my friends in AZ, and we were trying to decide on a place to eat. I didn't have much of a preference and wanted to make it easy for my friends who have a 1 yr old. They decided on this place, so I went with it! Next time I'll speak up and share my yelp knowledge...  Don't come here if you want good sushi. This place is mediocre at best. Maybe they don't have great sushi in AZ given the lack of ports?? I am always weary of eating sushi far from the coast. Anyway, I got a rainbow roll and spicy tuna roll. My husband also got some nigiri and dumplings. The nigiri and rainbow roll was just ok. Nothing really amazing in terms of presentation. My rainbow roll wasn't rolled very tightly and was kind of falling apart. The fish wasn't the most flavorful. The spicy tuna roll was just bad. It wasn't real spicy tuna!! They just took regular tuna and mixed it with sriracha/mayo...wtf?! I can't comment on the dumplings as I have to eat gluten free (Celiac). My husband said they weren't bad. Everything else I mentioned was safe for me to eat.   We also went here during happy hour. I felt like the happy hour was just ok...they had a big selection to choose from (drinks and food), but the discount wasn't that much. I feel like they could have offered more discount or deals. The service was fine, and they have giant booths to accommodate large parties. However, I won't be back. I also feel like I need to go eat really good sushi now to make up for this bad experience."}
{"text":"Decent lunch menu.  Great spicy shrimp roll & vegetarian roll.  Very attentive service.  However, for a quiet Sunday lunch with few patrons the preparation was slow.  Perhaps they were short a chef? Close to theater so maybe a post movie restaurant.  If you dine prior to the show you might be late."}
{"text":"The service was prompt and the sushi was very good---fresh and delicately made, with nicely cooked rice. The garlic edamame starter was also tasty (although everything arrived quickly and at the same time, so things could be paced a little better). The ginger blossom cocktail was refreshing. All in all, a very good experience. This is a great place to recharge after checking out Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"I felt the sushi was very good and fresh. Outdoor atmosphere was nice and the food came out quickly.  The best deal to be had is during the happy hour. I would return again to this business."}
{"text":"The horror... the horror... the horror. This is anything but Japanese food. The food here is about as authentic Japanese as Mexican General Pancho Villa was an authentic Soviet astronaut.   Making great sushi is indeed an art, so it would seem like a no-brainer to make something like a chicken teriyaki. That is until you come to RA. Not only was the chicken dry, the rice was soggy - yes, SOGGY - the bok choi was overcooked, the mushrooms were undercooked, and the \"sauce\" was watery. It was horrible. I couldn't even finish half of this dish.   And if it was just my dish that was bad, then I'd be forgiving. But it wasn't. My girlfriend's dish was terrible, too. She didn't finish hers either. The best thing on her chicken salad was the avacado, and that was good only because all they had to do was slice it and put it on the plate. She also had some sushi, and complained that it wasn't very good.  Service was terrible. The hostess was friendly enough, but the wait staff was awfully slow. We waited for almost 10 minutes while they \"cleared\" a table that was already clear... couldn't she have helped the wait staff out, or was it really that important for her to change the candles on the decor in the lobby at 3pm in the afternoon? When the bill came, our waitress didn't even bother coming back to the table to get my card - we had to take the bill to the hostess. Not the waitress, the hostess. That's terrible service. They got no tip.  Anybody that thinks this is good food is obviously out of their mind, and has absolutely no comparison to good, authentic Japanese food. It's just crap here. The decor is nice, the location is nice, the people watching is nice. But if it doesn't come in a sealed bottle, don't order it, because it's going to be crap.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"Came in a Friday night with a very large group. This place is great for saki bombers. I had a seaweed salad and grilled vegetables consisting of asparagus, broccoli, eggplant with a sweet sauce."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Ra for the last 8 years but I haven't been in the last 6 months.  Today I decided to indulge.  I walked in and did not get the usual friendly greeting at the door...very disappointing.  I sat down while waiting for a friend and just felt the worst vibe from the waitress and the bartender who acknowledged my presence with a mere glance. When I asked for a glass of water with the lemons on the side the waitress placed the lemons on a napkin instead of a dish.  Needless to say, I was annoyed so when my friend called to say she was pulling up, I decided to head over to the sandbar instead."}
{"text":"I love RA! Not for their sushi, but for their bento boxes! They do not cheat you! The bento boxes are only available during lunch time. I got the salmon teriyaki bento box and it was scrumptious! $9.35 and packed with food. Sign up for their email and get a $20.00 certificate for your \"half-birthday\" via email. Seriously!"}
{"text":"Shared the spicy chicken teriyaki udon which was pretty good, but the noodles overwhelmed the chicken and veggies by a lot. It filled us up pretty quickly.  Also shared the pineapple chicken and loved it. After seeing the dish, ordered white rice to go with it and that could have been a meal in itself.  Service was good, but brisk nearing the side of rude.  Don't even ask about getting a Bento Box after 3pm. (Rules are rules, and 3:03pm means no Bento Box!).  Overall, okay for a hangover meal in Vegas. (At 3:03 in the afternoon no less...really, I'm not that much of a baller)."}
{"text":"Stumbled on RA while waling in Scottsdale on Sunday evening. The place was pretty full and we decided to try it. We requested a seat outside and were seated immediately. Had an amazing server - Mikayla (purposely remembered her name so i can include it in my review), who made our experience great! She recommended a great cocktail based on my description of what I like and she also suggested what rolls and sashimi to order. The sushi was good, though the rice was not the best (hence 4 stars and not 5), and the fish appeared fresh. If i am ever in Phoenix again, i will be sure to go back to RA."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for Mediocre sushi.  You come for the atmosphere not the genius food.  That said, I had a lovely time before my movie drinking the Kizakura Pure sake - light, floral, delicious.  My bartender Kat was attentive and knew her stuff.  The music was not at 1000 decibels which I appreciated.  Overall nice experience and will come back every few months!"}
{"text":"The restaurant looks classy on the inside, but we sat outside because it was a gorgeous day! Great service and great food! We got there just in time for happy hour as well!"}
{"text":"The service was HORRIBLE. Everything took forever to arrive and some of it didn't even arrive. I had to remind my server again and even ask a server assistant for something and it still didn't arrive. RIDICULOUS.   The food was great. The restaurant was clean. I like the setup and the location is pretty neat being in Old Town Scottsdale.  Later on, a new server came in the picture to help out the other one and she was GREAT. She remembered everything and was very nice. Good job, lady!  I am not sure if I will return or not."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is for the location & the mule I ordered was pretty good. We were seated on the patio by the host & was told that he'd find us a waiter.  At least 10 mins later, after trying to make eye contact with an employee, a manager came over asking if we needed something. We explained our situation & he said he would grab a paper & take our order. He did this & comped our pork gyoza which was a nice gesture but truly didn't cause me to want to come back. The veggie egg rolls were soggy in the middle which usually I only experience at a cheapy asian restaurant. The gyoza wasn't great either. We ordered everything at the same time yet one of rolls didn't come until we were done with our appetizers & other 2 rolls.  We had actually forgot that we ordered this item, it arrived that late. We also ordered as a main course, an udon, chicken, veggie dish. Upon it's arrival I was very happy since we were still hungry. Unfortunately we left 95% of it...that is how bad it was. The noodles were thick & slimy, more than we both would've liked, thr chicken was overcooked (dry) & veggies were closer to raw than al dente."}
{"text":"I'd usually give RA a 4 or 5 star because I never have bad sushi there but this location is not the typical RA that other locations hold its standards to. It reeked of bleach when we walked in, it's nice they try to keep the place clean but it's a nauseating smell. The place was pretty run down and could really use some repairs. It reminded me of the sketchy hole in the wall asian or sushi bars to be honest. Not the usual upscale dining experience other RA locations have offered in the past. The booth we sat at had a gaping hole in the middle of the bench so I was forced to sit all the way next to the wall or almost falling out of the booth. This should really be fixed! The sushi was delicious and the lunch prices weren't bad but I wouldn't consider paying the expensive prices here on a night out for the atmosphere when I could pay the same amount some where else with a much more upscale vibe. If they could just fix the place up a bit it would be so much nicer!"}
{"text":"There are RA sushi locations in Houston, I don't care for them.  Bad service for overpriced, undeserved food.  Well, I had a to spend the night in Phoenix and hungry.  There were only two restaurants opened, Applebee's and RA.  Hmm...which to choose...I don't like either.  My friend suggested RA since he likes it in Houston.  Wow!  It was fun!!  The inexpensive sake bombs and yummy sushi.  When you haven't eaten all day and your first meal starts at 11 pm...it was heavenly!!  The bartender was super awesome!!"}
{"text":"I've been to RA sushi in San Diego, and now i randomly got to try the location in Las Vegas.  I really like the ambiance and feel of the restaurant. Dark lighting inside with lots of cool hanging red orbs.  They had a live dj. The music was really good and on point.   They had plentiful of seating inside and outside. The outdoor seating has light water spraying everywhere to keep you cool. But I was thinking.... wouldn't the water get all over the food and drinks? We got a table inside anyways and it was nice.  Some of the sushi rolls are good, and most of them are just ok. The sushi rolls range from $10-$17.  Here are all the sushi rolls we ordered with the prices: Lobster Salmon Roll $13.45 RA Lollipop 15.25 Crazy Monkey Roll 10.25 Scallop Dynamite Roll 13 Mango Lobster Roll 11.25 RA'cking Roll 13.25 Soft Shell Crab Roll 12.25  My number one favorites were the scallop dynamite roll, RA'cking roll and the crazy monkey roll!!! Their Garlic Edamame ($5.30) was amazing too.  I also really enjoyed the Umami punch bowl for $18. It wasn't that strong though, just more fruity. but still delicious.  And since it was my birthday, I received a complimentary mochi ice cream plate with strawberries, kiwi, and whipped cream which was nice.  Overall service was good, food was okay."}
{"text":"Weee doggy!! Every time I strut into RA, I'm greeted by the sweetest hostess, Morgan! What a bell!! What a doll!  Sitting down is an adventure, the sushi chefs always give me a winkle that makes me tinkle.  And thanks to my server, George.. I'm leaving feeling like a million bucks that just got thrown out a car window!! Done a great job those servers. Snaps for you all in a z-formation."}
{"text":"This place was okay, you can go somewhere else with better sushi. I think Ra has more Amercanized sushi than Japanese sushi since I come from a place with lots of authentic sushi restaurants. Most of the sushi on the menu doesn't contain raw fish, which is surprising since its called \"Ra.\" My sister ordered the \"Ra\" llipop roll and I got the crunchy shrimp tempura roll. She did not like the roll, but my crunchy shrimp was fine. I have to say that their beef teriyaki bento box was really good. The meat had a really good sauce. They also had good service, which always makes things better."}
{"text":"I'm not the biggest sushi fan, but I have to say that RA in old town is probably my favorite sushi place in the area.  The happy hour is great.  So many food items on it and you can't beat the sake bombs.  Ra'cklin shrimp is my fav appetizer.  I'm not too adventerous with my sushi but their shrimp tempura roll is my favorite out of all the sushi places I've been to.  Like it Like it Like it."}
{"text":"I had forgotten, I hate this place. The sushi is just so average. Everything about this place is average. To many other amazing places to waste time with this one. I'd eat next door at Strip Burger or Cafe Ba Ba Re any day."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place zero stars. We waited for half an hour just to get our edamame. After another half an hour our spicy tuna roll came with spoiled cucumbers. The sushi from the grocery store taste better than these. The service was horrible too. Do not come here."}
{"text":"Allow me to say \"Yum\" with a capital Yummy! I always enjoy this place. Great happy hour specials and great views of patio seating and strip!   Bartenders are sweet as pie, attentive and very helpful with menu questions.  Nice music, not to loud, not to soft!"}
{"text":"My friend and I come here often! Ra is really good and the waiters and waitresses have been really nice and friendly. I love getting the Chirashi bowl, but the sushi is really good too! The Vegas roll is pretty cool and I haven't seen any other sushi place do it like that and have it taste as good as it is. I would recommend this place to others. My suggestion is to go during happy hour because that's when you'll get the best for your bucks!"}
{"text":"Much better RA. This was the way you used to be 10 years ago. I had stopped coming due to poor food quality ie bad flavors cold when should be hot and vice versa, bit this time really good warm crispy rice bed on crispy spicy tuna, great pot sticker sauce this time,  fried calamari cooked perfectly.  Even the Las Vegas roll was warm bottom and cold top with fresh taro chip. Keep it up an we will be back more regularly- you must have had some serious shake up in kitchen and management."}
{"text":"Went into RA to grab a drink with a few friends. It took the bartender 15 minutes to determine if my ID was real, along with my friends ID. I understand that the laws are very strict here and I appreciate the bartender being careful but 15+ minutes to get my drink and NO apology from anyone!!! WHAT THE...probably won't be back."}
{"text":"After seeing the other reviews on here, I was a little worried. After a plethora of strange and slightly difficult dining experiences in Vegas, we weren't sure we had another one in us.  We went ahead and made a reservation for RA one night because it was close to our hotel. We were greeted by several hostesses and by the manager when we walked in. A little before 7, it wasn't crowded at all which was great. Our server was super friendly and engaging.   The food was really good. Highly recommend the Viva Las Vegas roll like other users have. We also had a Rainbow Roll and some Yellowtail Sashimi...all of which were great. RA is a moderately upscale sushi chain so their prices aren't too high but they're also not as low as your local neighborhood sushi place might be.  It's not really place I would recommend going to if you want to sit down and catch up with people. At the risk of aging myself...the music is pretty loud and it's hard to hear. It has a very cool, modern vibe though. It would be a great place to sit in the bar and have a few drinks and rolls at, and they do have happy hour!  Definitely recommend making a reservation (you can use OpenTable) if you're going on a weekend or during the holidays like we did. By the time we left (around 8), the place was totally full, so it definitely gets busy."}
{"text":"The sushi was good.  The service was ok.  We couldn't keep track of who was serving us...there were so many coming and going.  We didn't like that different rolls we ordered were all coming at different times, instead of all at once.  We stayed at the Wynn so it was right across the street and we gave it a shot."}
{"text":"I give this location no love.  We went to this one rather than the one uptown on a Saturday night with a voucher from another location from a bad sushi upchuck experience.  Going late at night with a mostly empty restaurant, we still ended up waiting 10 minutes to be sat, then SHOVED and I mean shoved in next to the only other table in the place - the hostess snickered at me when I kindly asked to move a single table down (really sick of bitchy hostesses in Scottsdale by the way - your job is not that hard so shut up and color for christs sake)  Our waitress took another 10 minutes just to greet us, sushi took forever, and if you can believe it the fun hadnt even begun yet.   When paying the bill, we present the voucher to the waitress, who says she cant take it.  The manager came over with a bitchy look, basically trying to call it bull shyt and continued to give us the 5th degree about it for the next few minutes - certainly NOT appreciated.  She takes it to the point where she calls the other location where we got it (taking ANOTHER 10 minutes) and finally gives us our bill back - only taking off our 2 rolls and 2 nigiri.  This created one pissed off yelper instantaneously.  Don't bother with this location - you could find bomb shrapnel in your soup and they still wouldnt give a damn.    And for the sake of all that is holy - STOP WITH THE CRAZY I'M-TOO-SEXY-FOR-MYSELF SCENE!  YOU'RE NOT THAT COOL!"}
{"text":"RA ahwatukee is at it again...  friends wanted to come here for dinner, I vowed never to return after poor service earlier this year, but when your friends want to go, you deal.  We asked for a booth if possible, our hostess walks us around the dining room and we pass an empty booth, it was NOT reserved, it was cleared off, it was wide open...we told her \"miss, there is a booth right there.\" Her response? \"Oh that table is like dirty, it can take 5 to 10 minutes to get it ready\"  It takes 10 minutes to grab a busser's towel and wipe the table off? It takes 10 seconds, I used to be a busser in high school..the hostess staff is so lazy and pathetic here it's a joke.  This is what RA has come to, just terrible service and lazy out of touch 18 year olds who don't understand life outside of their cell phone...Ra, you disappoint."}
{"text":"It's a lively place for happy hour and it's loud by 7pm on a Friday and crowded.  The food is okay. I tried 4 different items but was most impressed with the tempura shrimp.  I don't frequent sushi bars but I love Japanese food otherwise. I tried their sushi a crab roll it was no biggie, Neither was the short ribs or the spicy sesame wings. The plate presentation for the dishes were nice, I'll give them that."}
{"text":"Service is okay, but it seems there's miscommunication with the staff. They gave us the wrong food.   The sushi is expensive and something you would get for a lot cheaper in another sushi place. I should've known since I've been to Ra Sushi in San Diego; same comment for the sushi there. I thought Vegas would be different.   My boyfriend got an Asahi; he feels cheated because for the price he paid for should've gotten him a big bottle.   But I will pay $10 for the DRUNKEN CLAMS (5 out of 5)!!! It was delicious!!!   Am I gonna be back? I don't know. There's a lot of good food in Vegas to consider this one, especially for overpriced sushi. Maybe if a friend will want to meet there again. But I'll suggest another place."}
{"text":"I was in Tempe on business and was craving sushi- this place doesn't disappoint, though from the exterior I momentarily thought it was closed! Don't let the blackout curtains in the front windows fool you. Once your eyes adjust inside, it's got a very cool vibe.  The happy hour specials are solid and the salmon nigiri was great, very fresh, among the best nigiri I've had! The spicy yellowtail roll was also good, but not really all that spicy, and the service was fine but nothing to write home about... Solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Sushi rolls and sashimi were good.  Service was good.  Warning: Hot miso soup is freakin hot; temp and spicy."}
{"text":"Never go for the food.  It's not that it's not good, it's just that it's okay.  Always go for the drinks and company.  My friend and I visited during happy hour and got out the cheapest ever.  Our service was good, not stellar, but good.  I think that if they had happy hour all day, it would be awesome."}
{"text":"Joanne Y. and I were walking on the strip looking for a place to stop by for dinner. We stumbled upon RA and we were pretty excited since we'd been eating Earl's, pizza and Chipotle all weekend. (Yes! Finally a sit-down meal with healthier food so we don't feel like whales.)  They have a really extensive menu and we were pretty surprised to see that everything was reasonably priced. I ordered the Dinner Sashimi Assortment which had four pieces of tuna, salmon, yellowtail and whitefish; served with a bowl of rice and Miso soup. It was under 20 dollars which is definitely worth it.   However, one of the pieces of whitefish had a small bone in it which took me by surprise. You don't expect to bite on something hard when eating something with melt-in-yo-mouth texture. I wasn't going to say anything about it but later on in the meal, I discovered two much bigger bones, one in a yellowtail and another in the whitefish. I eat sushi a lot and have never encountered bones in my sashimi before.  2 stars because management was nice enough to discount my meal."}
{"text":"Sushi was really tasty, fresh, we ordered the Vegas roll it was delicious! If you like sushi and want it for a fair price this is the spot, also if your lucky enough to get Charlie as your server you will be rating this Sushi restaurant 5 stars too!"}
{"text":"I came here on my birthday last year and I would have given it like a 10 stars if I could... It was so fun and things got pretty crazy   I went today for dinner again and I think it wa alike us and like maybe 5 other tables...  The food was average and it was sort of dead and quiet.."}
{"text":"Great bar selection, fun atmosphere. Their green apple martinis are a little on the sweet side, but really good overall. If you're going on a weekend evening plan on making a reservation or waiting for a bit, it can get a little crowded due to a small space."}
{"text":"This restaurant was good, and the prices weren't too bad. I thought it would be more pricy giving the fact that it was in front of the strip. If you sit outside, then you can see what goes on at the strip, because the strip is right there. The service was good; my server had a really nice smile on her face. The food was good as well, I wouldn't say excellent though, but it was still good.  If you are in Vegas, and you are craving for some Japanese food, and if you don't want to spend too much, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Some things never change.. unfortunately, RA on Mill Ave. is one of them.   I went the other night for a Graphic Design networking event which involved drink tickets and my god, the bartenders could not have been more pissed that I ordered anything other than beer with them. If I would have known a Long Beach Ice Tea was such a pain in the ass I would have stuck with $1 Happy Hour Sake & Sopporo, but whatever. Sushi there is mediocre, I had a few different rolls, and nothing seemed very fresh. I cant say it was bad, but i've had much better in the valley. I think the appeal of this place is the happy hour specials they offer.. they do have good deals but overall I think RA cares more about image than good service & quality food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we just had to walk out of RA. We were seated and then ignored for 20 minutes. I went to the hostess and informed her that we hadn't been seen yet. She went to talk to someone and still nothing happened. Due to our two kids being small, we don't go out to eat often. On dates we usually end up at RA because it's a favorite of ours. I'm extremely disappointed with how my experience went this evening."}
{"text":"RA is a great happy hour spot and is pretty happening on a Friday night!  The music is always great and even when it's chilly outside, the heaters keep the temperature perfect.  The service is okay, pretty friendly, just busy.  I tried the Mango Margarita last time and it was delicious.  With so many items on the sushi happy hour menu now, it is hard to pick sometimes, so I just got my usual of the Spicy Tuna Roll and the Salmon Nigiri, and of course, always edamame!  The side of grilled veggies is also one of my favorites, a little on the spicy side, just the way I like them!  Go on your birthday and enjoy a full size Tempura Ice Cream dessert!  Plenty for the whole table to share!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing AC for a 109 day lol  Their happy hour is chill  The blushing geisha is fantastic and so is their rainbow roll!!  Seared tuna is thin with a sauce that's better asked for on the side. My 4 y.o. loved their teriyaki chicken and rice plate.  I'm a mojito connoisseur but I did not love theirs. I felt bad sending it back after I already sent the sangria back for tasting bitter. I would come back and recommend this spot - I just know what to get now :)  Eric (our server) was amazing so be sure to ask for him."}
{"text":"I love this place! I haven't been their since I been married, but my buddies and I would go during spring training! Great food, great service and the eye candy coming in you couldn't beat. One day I'll take the wife to see what excellent sushi is all about!"}
{"text":"Don't let the construction deter you, they are open and it's great. When I found out that their was a Ra within walking distance from where I was I had to go. We got their and all we wanted were rolls, they were fantastic. The only issues I had was that our server took a while to get anything done. Nice girl  but service was a bit horrible. It took 10 minutes to get our order in, only got our water refilled once, when I looked to see it seemed like she was hanging out with her friends tat came in to eat. Nonetheless I give them three stars in this location because I like the brand and the food. Fix the service for your other two stars!"}
{"text":"yeah, this is the place where pseudo sushi afficienandos go to feel like their really exotic food experts. if it's got cream cheese in it, it ain't sushi, and this place has cc is just about every roll.  happy hour is LOUD in the bar. not fun loud, but \"let's crank the bad early 90s alt rock and top 40 emo rock as loud as possible\" seemingly as catch all for the only demographics who will like this place- early 20s and late 40s and 50s who want to seem like they still know how to get down with the younger generation.  because it's ahwatukee (a \"sleepy bedroom\" community that is pretty affluent all in all and likes to be reminded), the crowd can be obnoxious, even more than this bar already is.  again, i recommend it as a place to go and be rowdy, not to eat great sushi."}
{"text":"this isn't necessarily the place you go for great sushi. especially becuase of its location on Mill with all the college crowds, its where you go to feel like you're enjoying the trendy sushi thing.  on a monday its (during school times) its packed and loud inside, on weekends, it pack and really loud inside and out. the drink specials are ok. i wouldn't recommend it for a date unless your a college freshman and you want to be in your element. but its fun with a group of friends and youre feeling rowdy and want some sushi snacks."}
{"text":"....Speechless.....I mean really...I don't understand how anyone could call THAT sushi.  I usually don't flat out say horrible...but this place, it is horrible.  I understand that there are people who have not been exposed to anything but this so called sushi place.  If you are one, please please do not think this is it.  If you want good sushi in Arizona, try Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  Yes, it is more expensive but at least you are eating SUSHI.    *Decor = trying very hard to be \"hip\" *Atmosphere = loud with drunk people all over *Food = SUCKS...really, they truly suck *Service = slow"}
{"text":"Had the best experience for lunch a couple weeks ago!  Devon was hands down the best server we've ever had. Anticipated every need and went above and beyond. Also loved that he didn't give me a hard time when I asked for no rice lol. We've had some bad service experiences there in the past but Devon is RA's saving grace! More servers like him please!"}
{"text":"No stars actually.    We get to Ra to check out the happy hour and waited at the front for a while to get seated.  Then I said to my husband \"it's happy hour, we should just go to the bar area\" so we did, found a small table with nothing on it.  Sat down - I was sort of annoyed that there was no hostess.    15 mins later a server comes over and asks if we were seated by the hostess - we said no and that we waited at the front for a while then decided to just sit down, and she said it wasn't a problem, she would get us menus and would be over in a min to get our order.  Sweet we think.   Next the bitch of a hostess comes over with her stank attitude and literally threw my menu at me, to the point where my water almost knocked over, didn't apologize and barked at us \"you're not supposed to sit yourselves down, you're supposed to wait for me to seat you.\"  Do I look like I cared?  Come on, you work at a sushi place in the mall, not some 5-star Gary Denko joint.  Get over yourself.   I was really annoyed.  Thank god our waitress was helpful and really nice, we left her a fat tip, hopefully she got it.  I don't think I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Loved the ambience friday night. Sat outside patio area our waitress was very helpful.  To start I had the Miso Hot soup, which took awhile to get and when it arrived it wasn't even that soup. So when I finally did get the soup it was delicious & spicy. Grabbed Two signature rolls Ra'ckin roll & Viva las vegas roll, I still crave it. Overall food took long but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"If you know and like real Japanese sushi, you will hate this place. They take numerous liberties with sushi and don't bother to inform you that they have. Their hand rolls are not nori but \"soy paper\" whatever that is. I grew up in Tokyo and have never heard of it.  Their rolls are covered in textures that are way closer to Mexican food. There are much better sushi bars in Vegas. Pass on this one."}
{"text":"I don't understand how this place only has 3 stars.  I went for the first time last night and it was delicious.  Plus the atmosphere is very cool and trendy.  The specialty rolls are really unique and tasty.  The only thing I could complain about is that some rolls only have 4 pieces.  I'll definitely go back here again.  Get the Viva Las Vegas Roll.  It's amazing!"}
{"text":"The happy hour prices are great, but you do get what you pay for. The cocktails were pretty bad. The sushi rolls were eh (no stand-outs, no great flavors). The service was nice, but slow and spotty (all the staff definitely seemed overwhelmed). The place itself is not so bad (much larger than your typical sushi place) - I recommend sitting at the sushi bar. Overall, though, as much as I wanted to really like it, I have to go with 2 stars. It was just wasn't good."}
{"text":"Painfully slow service.  Ordered a negroni, got a drink missing the gin.  Half the table finished before the food finished arriving."}
{"text":"RA seemed like a legit sushi restaurant while we were sitting in our hotel room, craving sushi. We opted to wait a bit and head over to catch their reverse happy hour (10 pm-close). The interior is nicely dimmed and has a cozy feeling. There was a good vibe in there and thank god it was not noisy and hectic. Getting away from the crazy loud Vegas life to enjoy a meal was refreshing.  Ordered off the happy hour menu. Wasn't too impressed with what I saw on there so I figured I'll go with what I know and keep it decent. From what I saw around my table, rolls were slightly small, my rainbow roll was just okay. The albacore was probably the best dish I sampled. Honestly, nothing was too memorable for me and same goes for my friends.  On  a good note... service was phenomenal, even hooked me up with a sake on the house. BUT, their idea of a large sake, is weaaaaaakkk. That's a small ass bottle my friend. A quiet, chill, not too stuffed but sorta buzzed evening gives my experience at RA a solid 3 stars."}
{"text":"Good sushi, but the music is a bit loud. And don't even get me started with that \"if it's too loud your too old\" bullcrap. It's just not a pleasant place to have a great conversation. The patio is nice though, and the service has always been good. I recommend the tootsie roll and the Las Vegas roll. Both are better then average."}
{"text":"My significant other and I were hungry after a symposium at The Yard last night and decided to mosey over to Mill Avenue. Loving sushi the way I do, I conned him into sushi at 11 pm. I was worried the RA servers would be irritated since it was pretty late but we were greeted by security and an adorable girl up front, seated in Gaby's section in back as it was pretty busy.   First off, this girl was great. I couldn't figure out what I wanted but decided on a Kirin Light and some appetizers, gyoza. Then of course two rolls of sushi, which my boyfriend doesn't eat (don't ask me why, he's crazy) so he ordered a Pepper Steak. Gaby was great to let us know that there would be a time difference as the steak takes longer than the sushi.  Our gyoza also came out with our sushi which was totally fine but she was great to make sure that was okay with us, keep our waters filled and humor me while I talked about my dog, we exchanged stories while she attended to other tables and she was great.   When I asked for the check she even gave us a discount card to come back for some appetizers and helped me understand what happened with the businesses moving next door (Correlones, etc) and the massive amount of people with odd church picket signs outside.  The experience totally made my night and I will be back, and asking for her section.   Thanks Gaby for making some post college kids feel welcome on Mill on a Friday night and for the great service!"}
{"text":"Blah.  This might be a good place to go if you're drunk and don't care about the quality of sushi you're eating but if you're sober and is somewhat coherent about what you're putting in your mouth then don't come here.  I ordered the sashimi plate and what came out were these poorly cut tiny pieces of fish on top of giant mounds of shredded daikon.  Sashimi is all about the way the fish is cut and whoever cut these pieces were either highly untrained in sushi making or wanted to save the restaurant some money by using the end pieces of the available fish.  Terrible.  Oh and the red lighting of the place gave me a headache."}
{"text":"Traveled all over the word and this place has the only sushi i can eat. The food is absolutely amazing but the service is terrible. It ruins ur experience and you just think twice every time you go there."}
{"text":"RA Sushi. Get it? It's a pun. Raw/Ra. Not to be confused with \"Rah Rah,\" a cheer which this place does not deserve. The food was perfectly fine. You feel like you're in a club though. That's not a bad thing, if you're in the mood. But you should know that I took a close look at the DJ and his turntables were definitely \"compact disc\" turntables rather than vinyl.  I enjoyed watching the patrons of the classier restaurant next door try to ignore the Brooke Hogan remix that was quite obviously blasting their faces off from the other side of the railing. The food was fine, but the service went to hell as I was never able to get my hands on a glass of water and they didn't have my beer after promising they would have it and it took close to 15 minutes to get the bill."}
{"text":"I LOVE Ra Sushi.   This location and VIBE is amazing. I love the waitresses and its always a great time going there. In the evenings and on weekends sometimes they have these amazing DJs making your happy hour even happier! I think their vegetable roll is really great since I don't eat fish. It has a great mix of Veg. Overall the food is WAY better than Jimmy Woo's just north on Scottsdale Rd. The atmosphere is awesome, and there is just some great ENERGY that you feel. I go ALL the time but I did have a bad experience once on Good Friday when all the cute waitresses were taking the day off, they were short handed and a gentlemen took care of us and was not attentive enough. But that is out of 15 times, and I understand there are off-nights. That still is not enought to keep me away, I will be going to RA for as long as they are open.   PS. They have bento boxes at lunch that are a great deal & super fun. Their house Pinot Gris is BOMB, hits ya' strong."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not worth the price you pay.  I love sushi, but I love good sushi with good service, and I will pay so if it is worth it.  Ra was SO not worth it.  We went on New Year's Eve before heading to Tangerine.  For NYE at 6:15, the place was fairly dead.  We had a party of 7.  We filled out our sushi paper.  The waitress lost it and brought us back another one and asked us if it was ours, and when it wasn't, told us to fill it out again.  It took her forever to bring out drinks.  If it was busy, then this would have been more understandable, but the place wasn't busy at all!   Plus, my friend wanted warm saki, and we were informed they weren't doing warm saki that night.  WTF!  Then, when we get the check, gratuity it added in -- it was one of those cases when she just didn't give a shit.  As for the food, it was average sushi.  The alaskan king crab nigiri didn't taste very good at all, which was very disappointing.  I was suprised at the fried calamari maki, which was a house speciality and it was good.  Edamame came gratis, which was nice since we were waiting forever for our drinks.  Overall, when I am at a nice restaurant, paying Las Vegas strip prices at a chain restaurant, I expect something better than I get at the budget Chicago Boystown sushi joint.  That is why Ra at the Fashion Show gets 3 Stars."}
{"text":"Sushi is good and there are a ton of different rolls! Drinks are fun and atmosphere is neat."}
{"text":"Ra Ra Sis Boom Blah.. Ive tried so many times to eat here and like it since there aren't  really any other sushi restaurants nearby.  Its just not happening. Sure they have a great happy hour prices, but I don't think I should have to fish lemon seeds out of my sake bottle, or have little nats swimming around in my soy sauce. The sushi wasn't very fresh at all. This would be a great place to go if you've never eaten sushi before, so then you'd have nothing to compare it to."}
{"text":"This isn't a bad sushi place, but it isn't the greatest either. The food here is average and some of the dishes seemed Americanized (in my opinion).  The service here, on the other hand, was awesome! Our server, who I nicknamed Magic Mike, was amazing! The staff that brought out our food were very friendly and funny as well. I wouldn't mind eating here again if I worked up an appetite from shopping and was craving sushi. I otherwise wouldn't go out of my way to dine here."}
{"text":"Nice place and location but the food was not very good. We were the firsts ones in and took 40 mins for our food. For the price go to sushisamba."}
{"text":"Decent tasting sushi.  The decor is pretty; very fitting for the Vegas scene.  Sushi pieces were a bit small, but the presentation was nice.  This place is in the outdoor area right in front of Fashion Show Mall.  The location is great, right across of our hotel.  The lunch specials are great; you get a lot of food for $6-8 bento boxes."}
{"text":"This is not my first time to RA, but probably my last. Hands down the worst dinner experience of my week long trip to Scottsdale. The food itself was okay. About what you'd expect for sushi in the middle of the desert. I admit that this is the first sushi establishment that I've been to that served lettuce in their \"premium rolls.\"  What sucks here is the service. We arrived on a night when half the building was emptied and they asked if we had a reservation. When the response was no, we waited....and waited. It was amazing to see three employees at the host table not helping any customers (other than the one on the phone). One poor young lady just wanted her phone ordered food for which she paid for and....you guessed it! Waited. With half an empty facility, what was everyone waiting for???  Once we finally got a table, the waitress was nice. Didn't change the fact that she seldom checked on us, which was too bad. We were ready to order more cocktails. In the end, we just wanted out! It's not often I question how much tip to leave, but this was the exception..."}
{"text":"the service is slow, but the happy hour prices are great. the music inside is generally deafening, so i like that they have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Great location at Fashion Square and we sat outside but still under the mall cover. Service was prompt and courteous. Good selection on menu from sashimi to sushi rolls and appetizers. Everything we ordered was good and we all left full. Happy hour prices aren't that much of a discount but saved a couple bucks. Total bill, including drinks and tip was $150 for 4, so not bad. Was a better option than other higher priced sushi restaurants farther down on the strip. Fashion Square is far enough off the main strip that it didn't have a big crowd and was a good stop for dinner before catching an early show"}
{"text":"Classy, reasonably priced. Outside seating to people watch on the strip. Servers all super friendly great energy very accommodating. Sushi is some of freshest I've ever had. Very accommodating if you like special made rolls the chefs don't look at you like they want to kill you for asking for something extra or a special made roll. This is one of the best sushi places around the Wynn and on the strip IMO."}
{"text":"Located outside of Fashion Mall across from The Wynn, this place is the best kept secret on the strip! They have a Sunday night Happy Hour that I would frequent if I lived in Vegas. We went in not even knowing it was Happy Hour and were more than pleased when we saw how cheap it was. We got 5 dishes for what the cost one 1 would have been had we eaten in the casino. We ordered a bunch of rolls and appetizers and were extremely satisfied with each dish. It's not the best sushi I ever had, but for the price, it was worth it. The atmosphere was very lively, and our server treated us like we were the most important people in the world."}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times for their happy hour sushi and appetizer menu! It's a very cool environment inside, the restrooms are cool but a little dark inside, and the little round lamps make it very aesthetically pleasing. The service is pretty quick and not the kind of bothersome service. It's a sign of attentiveness and great service in my book!  The Happy Hour menu-- 3/5 3 stars for what it is! It's good but not super memorable. It's the kind of food that you eat to sustain life but with a hint to enjoy it's texture. I will mention that the Las Vegas Roll is very good! The calamari is really good as well. The others are just semi-noteworthy and I'll let you be the judge of them :)  Service/Waiting-- 3/5 There is hardly a wait for happy hour which is always a plus! You can basically walk off the street and ask the hostess for a table. Ask for the patio if the weather is fair and enjoy people watching coming from the Wynn of shopping at the Fashion Show Mall. The waitresses has always been on point each time I've gone there. They seem to remember us each time we've gone there and that's always a \"+\" in my book.  Overall experiences there has been pretty average and has yet to impress the regulars going there. I hear they have cool Sunday night happy hours but I guess I'll have to go and try to find out."}
{"text":"This is the BEST meal we had while staying for the weekend. The service was excellent -- we sat in Zach's section -- and the food and drinks were amazing.  Definitely try the Lobster Spring Rolls and the Viva Las Vegas! specialty roll. We also really enjoyed the the soft shell crab roll and the spicy yellowtail.  Honestly, we were surprised and felt like we got a deal! For 6 drinks, 2 apps, 6 sushi rolls, and a beef teriyaki entree, it was just over $150.00 for a great dinner. I can't say enough good things about this swanky fun spot!"}
{"text":"I love the wings here and was really disappointed to find out they were 86'ed tonight. Ordered the short ribs instead and was disappointed immensely. They showed up in a bowl with raw white onions on top and when I asked if that was normal I was told they were \"lightly sauteed\". They were raw, they had a nice flavor but were very dry. Just a bad combination all over. The Vegas roll is by far my favorite roll. It comes with little deep friend wagon wheels that remind my husband of Mexican snacks. The sesame garlic wings really are a great combination of flavor and crunch and a really good deal. Tonight they just weren't on their game and our experience wasn't great. Disappointing because it was a meet up event for my travel group."}
{"text":"Sushi!. Yum so good. Drinks excellent. Service nice and cordial. Definitely recommend the Asian Chicken wings. Sesame garlic. Delicious. Out of the roll selection my favorites. Caterpillar roll and Las Vegas.  Drinks in general are good. Although I am specially partial to Sake!."}
{"text":"Over priced vs Quality.  Service is hit and miss, depending on time of day."}
{"text":"We sat right on the strip. Great for people watching. Could not have been a better spot. Food was fantastic. Got recommendations from the waitress during happy hour 4-7pm. Many sushi rolls & drinks to choses from $5-$7. Liked all of it. Wish we would have found it sooner!"}
{"text":"RA is great...we really only go for happy hour but the menu suits us just fine. We enjoy the cream cheese/pineapple wontons and the veggie rolls!"}
{"text":"As a chef, I expect to be disappointed often and this was not the case. The hostess was on her game, the wait staff was attentive and knowledgeable. Music was good. We started with the RAkin' Shrimp appetizer which was a delicious and unusual way to fry shrimp with a creamy sauce so good we poured it over the green underneath and ate it as a salad. I had the teriyaki salmon bento box and the salmon was cooked to perfection with just a hint of pink, moist and not over-sauced. The veg was tender yet had texture, the white sushi rice was also perfectly cooked and so tasty it needed no seasoning. My husband had the Rainbow roll which was also very good and lovely to look at. We had drinks and this meal for right at $50!! What a find!! Yup, happy hour made me happy! Chef Jill"}
{"text":"This was mine and my boyfriends first time coming to RA thinking this was going to be a wonderful dining experience, little did we know.    Service took forever, our server seemed to disappear for periods of time. Not only did our service take forever but just to get our food seemed to take a crazy amount of time for being 1 of ten tables for an appetizer. It's pretty unfortunate that we had such a miserable dining experience because the food was just descent ordinary sushi.     Unfortunately we won't be returning."}
{"text":"The California roll sushi is outstanding! Come for lunch or dinner and bring your friends. RA is a fun place for a drink and sushi. I came for my birthday and had a fabulous time!"}
{"text":"Fun bar. Gets PACKED during happy hour, and on weekends after 9pm. Sometimes the music is a little too loud to hold a dinner conversation. But hey maybe I'm just getting old.  The sushi is CONSISTENTLY good, above average good. Yes, as other reviewers noted, you can find better. But no other sushi place I've been to in Arizona can consistently serve up good fish every time I come in."}
{"text":"Stopped off here today for lunch it is a Monday downtown Scottsdale. it's nice and sunny and hot the restaurant had maybe six tables and 7 people sitting at the sushi bar. I have been waiting for 9 minutes. I have not received the glass of water yet. the waiter has walked by 4 times my menu is sitting at the edge of the table waiting to order my food. There are several Sushi chefs just to my left less than 6 feet away. Nobody has come by to say hello other than the lady who seated me when I first walked in. I made eye contact with the server indicating I was ready to order I nodded and tapped on the menu another three minutes passed by. I got up to head to the door the hostess was standing there and she said thank you for coming by. don't you remember seating me less than 15 minutes ago. I said to her I haven't had anybody drop off any water or asked me if I wanted anything to drink let alone take my order. She just looked at me like I had 3 heads.  I just walked out. I hate to write bad reviews I much rather write a review about how wonderful a place was but this place fails to get my recommendation."}
{"text":"Las Vegas roll is yummy and great people watching"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this restaurant twice and both times I have left thinking this place is overpriced and the sushi quality is horrible. The sushi is equal to convenient store sushi. The spicy tuna roll is complete mush, the vegas roll is below average quality, and crunchy shrimp roll is completely tasteless and dry. I've grown up eating sushi and I've eaten at many sushi restaurants and this is by far the worse one I've been to. If that's not bad enough, there was a maggot or some kind of worm in the edamame I ordered this last time I visited the restaurant! I completely lost my appetite! I usually don't write Yelp reviews but my experience at this restaurant was so bad I felt like I needed to vent!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Chirashi bowl for lunch to go... this was all I got. I barely got any seaweed. Barely any fish. And this cost almost $12? I'm so disappointed in the serving portion when I can go elsewhere and get double the size for almost the same price. Do NOT come here expecting much portion. It's way overpriced and not worth it. There are a lot of places nearby that can offer better sushi for half the price."}
{"text":"Wow! The Sushi here Kicks Ass!! Next time I'm in Old Town, I'm definitely coming back!! Spicy Lobster roll was Awesome. But even more amazing than that, order the Tempura Calamari...whoa, Get Back Loretta!!   Service: our waitress was friendly, helpful and did great Job!!"}
{"text":"Horrible, inexcusable service every single time I have gone. Staff is ignorant of its customers, slow and never seem like they care. I knew that had bad service, but I have never been so infuriated at a restaurant than the staff made me the other night. I called in an order for pick up, it was a Thursday night. The woman taking my order told me 45 minutes. 45 minutes?! For a Cali roll and a spicy tuna roll?! Whatever.   I waited an hour before leaving to pick it up, just to be safe.  When I got there, the hostess took one look at me, grabbed her purse and proceeded to leave. I asked about my order and she simply said, \"They'll help you\", and walked out. RUDE. I waited at the hostess station for 15 minutes. No one came to help me. I was ignored by the bartenders and other staff members. After the 15 minutes I walked back to the sushi bar and asked one of the cooks about my order. He spoke very broken english, and told me he didn't know about my order and to ask the bar.   So, I walked over to the bar, stood right up next to it and waited to be helped. Nothing. For another 15 minutes at least!!! It was completely ridiculous- they weren't even busy! I finally got  the attention of one of the 2 bartenders by waving my arm over the counter. He came over and I told him I had a to-go order. He said okay and took my card to ring it up. 10 minutes later my order was FINALLY given to me. I think the manager on duty was the one who gave it to me, and he just handed it to me and walked away.   So after over AN HOUR AND FORTY-FIVE MINUTES I finally received my food. What a joke.  This place doesn't even deserve 1 star. The service here is so terrible that everyone should be fired, and there are people out there who would actually be grateful to have a job here and could give way better service. This is only one of the many horrid experiences I've had at this location. Something needs to be done."}
{"text":"Great place for happy hour. I'm a huge fan of the location, in the heart of Mill Avenue in Tempe, around all the cool spots. I particularly enjoy going there to grab a quick bite and a few beers after work during the week.  Staff has always been friendly and they have a great outdoor patio in the back for the months when it's not too hot.  Only reason why i'm not giving it the full 5 stars is because I feel like they're a bit understaffed when they're full and it can take for ever to get food or a drink at the bar. The other night the bar outside was full and they only had one guy covering the bar. He was trying his best, I can't blame him!  Other than that, awesome place, great food, great location. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Nice and large portions, however, there were too much cheese and too chewy for my taste."}
{"text":"\"Like oh my god, I will totally get that roll over to you.\"    \"like oh my god, I'm so sorry I forget your drinks.\"  I felt like I was in the valley, not sure which valley, but definately a valley.  I thought our semihot waitresses head was going to explode!    4 stars though for cheap Sake Bombs!  Sake Bombs!  Man my favorite. I think this is the same place as the one in Vegas and my review would pretty much be the same.  As a San Franciscan who has about 10 million sushi options, this one out here in Vegas wasn't too bad for an out of towner."}
{"text":"RA is great because it doesn't have those weird sushi bar hours. It's literally always open. One thing that annoys me is that when you order they bring your food/drinks in an irritating order.  For example. You sit down order drinks/apps expecting them to come out first. Then you get your appetizer(no drink yet) place your order then bam it's out and followed by your drink.  This has happened on multiple occasions that my friends and I joke about it.  With that being said it's a chain restaurant so sushi is good / dinner menu but nothing too great."}
{"text":"Ate here twice already on our Vegas trip. Great service, yummy food and the price is more than reasonable.  Will miss this place"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good...the roll with the crab meat on top was amazing.  Also, the sake sangria was delightful!  I was very pleased with everything, although it was on the high end for not the best sushi ever.  I liked it, but c'mon, you're not getting the freshest fish in Vegas.  I was happy though, and the service was good.  I would go back."}
{"text":"Great food, the Crunchy Calamari roll is my fav! Other good ones are the Dragon, Viva Las Vegas and Caterpillar rolls!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the better sushi restaurant in Scottsdale. Love the fact that they have happy hour until seven daily. The food is a little pricey but the food is very good overall. Ordered the crazy monkey roll and spicy tuna roll. A good spot for a date."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in RA is a bit pretentious, fake and noisy. But I actually like the place. I enjoy sitting on the patio, having a few happy hour asahi's and maybe having a sake bomber or two. I only do this when the weather is nice, and try to avoid friday's or saturday's.   As far as the food, I have eaten at several sushi places throughout the country and they all taste a bit fishy to me. When I get sushi I actually like it to be a bit bland. I sampled some of the more exotic stuff, and it wasn't for me.  So, for not being a sushi aficionado, by avoiding the crowded times and coming to RA's during happy hour times (7-10 i think?) I actually enjoy it!"}
{"text":"This place is Hit or Miss, every time I have come here I have asked to rush the food because they are always so slow! I've only have had one fast experience when it was completely empty. Their food is very average unless you want to spend $15 for a quality roll that doesn't fill you up at all. The only thing positive would be the reverse happy hour from 10-close. If you are looking for quality sushi at a decent price I would travel somewhere else.  Also make sure you make a reservation ahead of time because they tend to take 10 minutes to \"set up a table\" for you in the back when it's not even busy!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere and decor very pleasing. Hostesses were very nice and genuinely welcoming. My date and I sat decided to sit at the bar. Drinks were great and food was absolutely delicious. Perfect bite size California rolls.  My downfall was the tiny little Asian female bartender. No eye contact with me. All her attention was on my date. Either she was trying to be flirtatious or keeping attention on him since he might be paying the tip. He even noticed her demeanor and was annoyed by her."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour. Very inventive drinks and wonderful choices on HH food specials. We love specialty rolls. The Viva Las Vegas roll, lobster salmon roll, and the monkey roll were all favorites of ours.  Service was great, food preparation was super fast, and the waitress was attentive. Great Sushi experience!!!!"}
{"text":"Service was a little off, not as fast and she kept forgetting things, but luckily they have food runners so someone else brought our food out, which was awesome! we had the catipillar roll, philladelphia, and the ra'kin shrimp appetizer. AMAZINGGG definitely going back. ;D"}
{"text":"Amazing food. RA Sushi in Vegas is one of the best. Carla was very professional and helped me celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday there. Thank you for a great service."}
{"text":"Very good quality sushi at an affordable price. Above average sake selection. Definitley the best sushi value on the strip."}
{"text":"As a vegas native, RA Sushi is a staple for my friends and I.  We have been going here for years because of their awesome decor, food, bar, and music (they have a dj on some nights).  When living in vegas we seriously went at least once a week.  Some of the sushi here is unlike any you get anywhere else.  Like some mentioned, quite a few have cream cheese in them and I have came to love it, while others are as traditional as it gets.  I always suggest this place to any friends that are going to vegas for the weekend and if you are a hip adult you should really like it.  *Try the Vegas Roll"}
{"text":"Yeah, it is a national chain sushi restaurant, but each location I have been to around the country delivers on atmosphere, presentation/selection and taste! We ordered a bit of everything which is always the case, like a self-proclaimed tasting menu. Starters: the Kimchi salads. The spicy pickled cabbage was sweet, crisp, light, and refreshing - the perfect appetizer. Of the variety of sushi on the table, the hands-down favorite were the hand rolled scallops. These are rich, sweet and more filling. One was fine with everything else we had going on at the table. We ate earlier than usual (7:00pm) and had no problems making a reservation earlier that day. Great crowd. Short cab ride from our hotel. Nice experience."}
{"text":"Ra Sushi, you are so BLAH to me. We came to Tempe for training and it is a town abundant in bars and restaurants, none of which are spectacularly amazing. And Ra Sushi is at the bottom of that list.  First of...you pay for the ambiance. Not the food. Not the Service. You may want to take a date here but be prepared to wait 30 minutes for your food. We came on a Tuesday night where it was relatively calm and quiet...it was almost empty. We ordered a few basic rows like the California and the Eel, but it took them 30 minutes to get our food out. Why? I don't know why, except that I saw the waiter constantly peering over at us to see if we noticed as he catered to the older customers. Maybe it's because we looked fresh out of college or it could have been something else...but the service is straightup terrible.  I do not recommend going to Ra Sushi...there's another sushi place down the block which is a lot better and it's cheaper.  Bye Ra."}
{"text":"I would give this place a higher rating but the fact that out of 10 x we order they always screw up 9 x is so ridiculous. My work orders from here at least 5 days out of the week because A the food is good and B the lunch menu selection and prices are really good. At first we would be missing some sauce here, a miso soup there but now it's gotten to the point where we have to double check our order and bag EVERY SINGLE TIME when we go pick up because they can't be trusted, and sure enough there's mistakes. Today we placed an order and of course when we got there it wasn't ready and then a side order was forgotten so we had to wait another 15 minutes and then the miso soups were missing so another 5 there. In total we waited 40 minutes over the promised time. The real kicker was when we got back to eat, our salmon teriyaki bowl and our chicken teriyaki bento box had NO SAUCE on it and was super dry. It's almost comical now and we're really confused as to how they always get it wrong. They weren't even busy! Anyways, long review short, we want to boycott but we can't because it's good sushi for normal prices on the Strip so our hands are tied hahaha"}
{"text":"The food is amazing but that was expected. That garlic ponzu sauce... I would bathe in it. The reason for this review though is there amazing customer service. Recent went for lunch with my girlfriend and we had a very minor issue with the food. We ate everything we were served and it was delicious and simply brought our concern to the server's attention. She apologized immediately and shortly after the manager came by and told us he had taken care of our entire meal. Since we had been able to eat our entire meal minus one bite, I didn't expect for anything to be comped. They went above and beyond customer service and just gained a customer for life. Won't be eating sushi anywhere else."}
{"text":"i was actually really pleasantly surprised by this place and I'm not sure why it doesn't have a better rating. its located near the fashion show mall and across from the wynn hotel. you have a view of the strip if you sit outside and if you sit inside you're surrounded by nice dimmed lighting with red accents from the lamps. it's really nice. ordered the lobster spring rolls and omg, TO DIE FOR. so gooood. but i only wish they gave you more than just four. especially since they're around $11. we also ordered a crazy monkey roll (VERY good), a smokey salmon roll which was good too & a spicy tuna roll. all were yummy and an excellent price for it being vegas AND on the strip.  every other sushi place on the strip has been $20 + for one roll. here they were about $10 - $13. i would recommend.    *** blushing geisha drink is amazing. tastes like a sweet tart or something!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here for a few years, and the last time, I remember thinking, \"eh, it is okay.\"  My sentiment remains the same. Everything is just... fine. The food is okay, somewhat overpriced, but being on the Strip, I guess I can understand that. We got the spicy shrimp roll, the tempura calimari, the peppers, and the chicken teriaki noodles.  The sauce for the peppers was really good, just a little too salty, and everything else was pretty average.  My main complaint was the service. Slow and lackluster, from the moment we walked in. We waited quite awhile to be seated, and our server \"forgot\" to bring us things we'd requested many times, from a fork to drinks we'd ordered.   I'd only return if someone else really wanted to go, or if I just was starving for sushi at Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"This would be a three-star if not for the crab nigiri. I don't know where they get their supply from, but all other sushi restaurants in town need to figure it out. Everything else is just a little too loud, a little too trendy, and a little too American-style for my tastes. It's a good place, just not my first choice for sushi. Unless, again, I've got a really craving for crab nigiri."}
{"text":"Great drinks. I love sitting at sushi bar here. Party crowd. I recommend spicy miso soup, sooooo yummy!!"}
{"text":"Met three of my siblings here after work on a Thursday. We were all coming from different parts of the valley, and this was centrally located. I sat in traffic coming from North Scottsdale for almost an hour and was the last to arrive. I was shocked that RA would not seat the rest of our \"party\" until I arrived. It was bad enough that I was late and stuck sitting in traffic, but also my siblings were stuck standing at the front of the restaurant waiting for me. Note: it was NOT busy -- at all. It was only around 5 pm and there were many open tables. I can't imagine why they wouldn't seat THREE people of a four person party.  Service was acceptable. My sister was having a hard time deciding what she wanted to drink (to the point of being a little annoying, I will admit) and you could tell the waitress was a little peeved. It was a mutually awkward situation, but I thought she could have handled it with a little more poise and professionalism. Other than that, food came out quick and fresh, drinks were refilled, etc. The food was good, and the restaurant clean (which I cannot say for all of the RA's I have been to). We got a few appetizers off of the Happy Hour Menu to share, a few maki rolls and a few drinks. Happy Hour prices are reasonable, and we enjoyed the atmosphere out on the patio."}
{"text":"After eating at the Wynn 's sushi bar and paying 300 bucks for 2 people,  I have to give RA 5 stars for a perfectly acceptable Nigiri and sashimi meal for 2 people for 80 bucks including drinks.  Fish was fresh, tasted well, and portions are enormous.  Lunch is an unbelievable deal here.   Well done, RA.  Keep up the quality!"}
{"text":"So I want to start out by saying that I love the food here as evidenced by me being a regular repeat customer.  The food is excellent and the sushi chefs are great.    First off the sushi bar service is on point.  However, the table service here is absolutely awful.  Every single time that I've come here and have sat at a table the wait is exorbitantly long compared to the other locations.  My order is the same every time:  nigiri, sashimi, and a poke bowl.  Nothing too complicated.  When I sit at the sushi bar the wait is ~5-10 minutes.  In contrast when I sit at a table the wait is more like ~30 minutes and sometimes longer and this is during times that are not very busy.  I'm not sure what's going on with their system but this is a recurring thing that seems to be getting worse.  I apologize to the staff that I interact with regularly for having to read this but I've been holding back for 6 months and being that I'm a regular customer i would like to see this improve so that I don't eventually start driving an extra 5 miles to go to the North Scottsdale location.  I live down the street from here and would very much like to continue enjoying the delicious food.  The table service just needs a serious makeover.  I'm not sure where the misstep is occurring but I do hope you identify and correct it!"}
{"text":"Unique and delicious rolls!  I've been making this place part of my Vegas trips for the past couple years.  The place is super cute inside, love the red and black theme.  Fresh fish, nice presentation, fast service are all part of what makes this place so good.    The green tea here is different.  I don't like it. :(  I also usually love lotus root and the one here is a disappointment.  But, both I can live without since I come for the sushi.   It's located in the fashion show mall, so great shopping break."}
{"text":"Ok, so this isn't the best sushi ever. Everyone knows that. But they have a great happy hour!   We came here and ordered 2 sushi rolls, 2 other apps (shrimp tempura and chicken yakitori) and 2 beers and spent just over $20 and we were stuffed. Sunday nights (right around 8 when happy hour starts) is a great time to come because the bar isn't too crowded. You have to get out before the DJ starts though because the music can be too loud. They have a nice patio which unfortunately faces the parking lot and busy Val Vista. Service was better than the other locations I've been too (Tempe, Ahwatukee, and Old Town). Plates were promptly cleared which a must when you're sitting at a small high top. This place is also very open. Some of the Ra's I feel almost claustrophobic in when I'm sitting inside.   This place is fairly close to home and the customers here are a little older, and the vibe here is more relaxed so I'll definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 different times twice earlier in the day during happy hour and once later in the evening. Every single time I've gone the service has been awful. It takes them forever to get your drinks, orders, etc. and whenever i have gone i have had unfriendly and uncaring servers.  I have also encountered the portions of food being noticeably smaller than the other restaurants. I remember ordering the tempura ice cream and was amazed at how small the servings were. I am use to those suckers being quite a decent size and I have had it enough times to notice that food portion is smaller than usual.  This is by far the worst RA I've been to and I do agree it does reek like wet rag. I'd recommend the RA in Ahwatukee or on Val Vista and the 60."}
{"text":"This is a good sushi place. I can't complain about any of the options at all. I got the shrimp tempura roll and loved it. I got the whole soft shell crab roll and did not like it, but that's my fault for being adventurous.  Cons: The menu is overwhelming and it is hard to nail down exactly what you want in a short amount of time.  The happy hour drink specials are still kind of expensive ($7 wine/$5 beer)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and we were not impressed. I work in the industry so I'm very understanding, but today's experience was disappointing. The sushi chef Ivan was super nice, he greeted us when we walked in. It was quiet, it wasn't busy, but our server Griffin, wasn't attentive & didn't really have much personality. My daughters drink never got refilled, and we would've asked but he didn't really come around to us.  We love Ra, we go all the time & have been to most in Phoenix area, and this one was disappointing. We still tipped him over 20%. Overall, the food is great, but not satisfied with customer service from our waiter."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is well worth it. It's a great place to have a few drinks and grab a quick bite. However of you are running short on time I suggest you find another Sushi Spot. The amount of time to enjoy your food and drinks will take them about 2 hours to serve. We usually stop by here during our lunch break but almost 90% of the time we run info issues. They delivery the wrong order. Please have gotten served before us, our food order has taken over a hour to arrive to the table.   I really think the only reason why we continue to go here is because we don't want to drive out for lunch. Working in the mall you run out of options so this tends to be the place for lunch. I mean the happy hour menu and their food overall isn't bad. It's the service and time! Never will you leave this place fully satisfied.   But hey if your willing to wait I suggest the Viva Las Vegas Roll and the RA ckin Shrimp."}
{"text":"Been coming to this place it has fell off big rim. I'm from San Diego and the one they had closed. The one in Vegas does alright we stopped by while in town. Service slow very slow. Than we ordered or food and two of our rolls came wrong annoying hungry but ate them our shrimp tempura roll was missing asparagus which we confirmed the roll came with! Annoying. They try to upscale you they had no kids menu and wanted my son a one year old a $17 chicken teriyaki plate lol. We ordered 6 rolls of sushi. Haha anyways. We asked for the check 10 minutes pass it's bedtime for our one year old I get up walk around with him like he should be back soon. No we ask him two more times for the check almost 30 minutes later we asked someone else they finally brought us the check and the box we asked for! When the server rushed and put the food we were going to box with dirty stuff from the table. Maybe it's because I'm military but attention to detail people. Upset about my experience."}
{"text":"Late night Happy Hour is great. I think we were forgotten about sitting outside a few times but overall we enjoyed our drinks and sushi."}
{"text":"4-7 Happy Hour!!  It was 6 and we were tired from shopping, and RA just happened to be there waiting for us!  Drinks range from $1 (sake) to $5.  Well drinks are $3, specialty drinks $4.  There's a happy hour menu which has some rolls and some other appetizers that are all half off.    For food, we shared a crispy spicy tuna roll, a viva las vegas roll, the scallop dynamite (appetizer, not roll), and crab cakes.  This came out to $20 which is quite a deal if I don't say so myself!  The crab cakes were great - there's 3 so it was good for sharing.  Crispy Spicy Tuna is sort of strange; it comes on these sesame rice balls that are quite glutinous.  The scallop dynamite is this baked, sizzling hot plate with some mushrooms and creamy sauce.  Good!      Nigiri is also half off (maybe only some kinds), so we tried the salmon and tuna ones.  Two pieces of nigiri for 2.50, not bad.  I had the Pamatini which was kinda pomegranate-ish with other stuff.  It was tasty =)   All in all, a good place to go for happy hour!"}
{"text":"You know when you see someone and they look really good and you think they are cool and want to hang out with them and halfway through your first conversation with them you realize that they really don't have a character and they are really nothing but looks? This is exactly what RA is for sushi. Lots of fanfare and no essence."}
{"text":"Love outdoor dinning. Fresh air. Making new friends. Staff very nice. Really feel welcomed here. Clean restrooms. Lots of space.lots of parking space."}
{"text":"Classic Sushi . Gotta love it . Staff very nice and helpfull  .  Easy to make friends ."}
{"text":"No parking.  Street only.  Pay meter.   Still the best sushi.   Very friendly.  Clean. Lots of fun."}
{"text":"My husband & I & some friends visited this place on a Monday nite about 6. Good timing! We ordered all our food & drinks  at happy hour prices. We had great food & good service but music was a bit loud. We would go again."}
{"text":"Decent prices for decent sushi and decent prices for decent drinks.  The service was excellent. If you are in tempe or near mill during happy hour go to RA. The shrimp tempura is tasty."}
{"text":"In the shadows of \"the cloud\" as it is known you will find RA a ultra hip, quasi-urban sushi spot.  For those that may not know \"the cloud\" is a massive (120'x480') structure that provides a shaded patio to the Fashion Show mall on the Strip.    This patio area remains quite cool even in the summer and provides an amazing opportunity for people watching.  The view from the patio seating at RA looks directly across the Strip at Wynn.  The music is a bit of a mystery, as RA is located directly beside a mexican restaurant that plays appropriate to theme music that competes with the fresh sounds provided by RA.  The staff was a mediocre.  They are knowledgeable about their menu, but they aren't exactly going to go out of their way to make sure that you do.  If you are lucky you might get someone to smile in your general direction.  The food is good, the menu selections vary quite dramatically.  If you are on the Strip, somewhere near Wynn and you want to take down some rolls or chugs a sake-bomb or three, RA might just be the spot for you."}
{"text":"I can't remember the exact name of the plates we ordered at RA Sushi, but there was definitely tuna, salmon, and hamachi sashimi.  I skipped tuna, but the latter two were very fresh.  I think this places is popular because of its look and feel.  It's very vibrant with colors, decor, music, and even the presentation of the food.  If you're looking for a lively, fun, and trendy spot then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"We had a very good lunch.  The service was good once we sat down.  we were ignored when we entered and waited to be seated.  We actually had to approach a server to be seated.  The sushi rolls were good.  A little pricey for lunch.  I would go back, but I would probably try other places first."}
{"text":"Had a great time. Waitress was pleasant and  helpful . Sashimi was outstanding. Fun atmosphere. All around good time"}
{"text":"Okay sooo, my sisters and I spent 12 days in Vegas this past December, and we ended up eating here twice because it was just that good.  The happy hour is unbeatable, and the drinks (although a little weak) are pretty tasty.  The only problem I had was that it was kept really cold inside, and the waitress during our second visit was a complete B word (use your imagination). I really couldn't care less about how poor her attitude was though bc we all got our fill on yummy soups, rolls , seaweed salad, and hot tea.  I was treating my sisters for our last night in town the second time around and I only paid 45$ for all three of us. Not bad."}
{"text":"Rolls are little small for the price but RA never lets me down on taste, plus they have rainbow rolls on happy hour and I've never been to a sushi place in town with that option!  Their giant fish bowl drink is pretty tasty too and fun to share with a friend... or not, if you're looking to get trashed."}
{"text":"We got an assortment of sushi, rolls, sashimi, etc.  The fish was fresh but the rolls weren't very impressive.  They were almost over the top and trying to hard.    The atmosphere is more of club than a suhsi bar.  The prices are also relatively high.  But if you want to be seen somewhere, how can you put a price on that."}
{"text":"Decent place to eat especially for the happy hour. Ra-ckin shrimp is probably my favorite thing on the menu hands down. Service is always good never too busy. A nice little place to stop in and grab a quick bite meanwhile shopping."}
{"text":"I should explain I don't like sushi.  I have tried to like sushi.  I dated a guy many years ago who was really into sushi and he would take me to the best Omaha has to offer and show me how to use the chopsticks and mix the wasabi, the whole 9 yards.  I gave it the good ol' college try, and I just can't do it.  My stomach rolls over after a couple of pieces.  Well, I think that, combined with the fact that when he purchased his new 7 Series, I didn't writhe all over it like Tawny Kitaen,  made me less appealing.  Such is life.  Now I'm married to a man who doesn't like sushi either.    What was I saying?  Oh yeah!  We had a great lunch at RA between movies.  We each had the shrimp tempura bento box, which came with 4 shrimps, a spring roll, a potsticker, a salad, miso soup, and some fluffy white rice for $8.95.  Everything was delicious.  We also tried their seaweed salad which was nice and fresh.  The service  was great too.   We  had a few of their cocktails which if memory serves, were very tasty, but we got a little loaded and then went to see Gravity in 3D, so my memory is a little hazy.   It was one of THOSE afternoons.    I thought the lunch was definitely a great deal and would go back for that anytime."}
{"text":"Probably the worst dining experience I can remember.  The food was average at best and the service was essentially non existent.  The couple next to us sat for 10 minutes waiting for their check.  The waitress never brought the beer we ordered but still tried to charge us for it.  Average sushi and bad service.  There are plenty of other good sushi places in Vegas so don't waste your time at Ra."}
{"text":"I am definitely a huge fan of Ra. They hands down have the best happy hour for sushi. There's plenty of options to choose from and also a good selection of drinks to pick. Depending on the day of the week they have specials that offer half off bottles of wine. Some recommendations I can say as far as sushi, is the crunchy calamari roll and spicy tuna. There are multiple locations, but I always opt for the old town location. Great spot, service, and great eats!"}
{"text":"Sushi on the strip..what do you expect?  We headed over to Ra after a show at the Wynn after reading the reviews....we were dressed well and had money to spend and were hoping for an amazing sushi experience.....which we didn't get.  Expensive?  Sure...but to be expected  Service?  I expected a lot more.  We sat at the sushi bar like we do every time we eat sushi because we like to interact with the chefs.....it's part of the experience...unless it's at Ra where the chefs don't even look up from what they're doing to say hi or a hearty \" irasshaimase!!!\"...or anything.    The rolls come out dry...or at least the 4 we ordered did.  No sauce at all....which is not my cup of tea since I now have to figure out their version of sauces (i.e. how spicy is their spicy mayo?).  Giving it 3 stars as there wasn't anything bad that happened....just nothing good or great."}
{"text":"No one here at 330 on a Saturday  and the service is HORRIBLE......  That's a joke I expect good service for expensive food"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about my experience here tonight. My family of 5 came to RA sushi for dinner after hearing good reviews about this place. We arrived at 10:05 PM tonight and were seated. Then, we saw that happy hour was from 10PM onwards on the weekdays. We ordered a Rainbow Roll from the HH menu (8.99 instead of 11.95), and two other rolls from the regular menu.  We were served by ROB. At first he seemed Ok. We were honestly just making small talk and joking with him throughout. Our order took 30 mins to arrive, which was fine despite it being a slow night with little customers. Sushi was ok as well; it was on the salty side.   When the bill came out, we were charged full price for the Rainbow Roll. We placed our credit card to pay; and asked a woman (bartender?) working there to let our waiter know to adjust our rainbow roll to the HH price.  He came out with the bill having charged us 11.95. No questions asked. I came up to talk to him, let him know the situation. I asked him why he charged us full price when it was HH? He responded, \"I don't know why you're doubting/questioning me *insert him scoffing*. I can't do anything about it now.  I can get my manager but it'll take a while cus he's busy.\" I'm 1000% sure it was HH when I arrived because I SPECIFICALLY looked at the HH menu, and then at my watch to show 10:05 before exclaiming to my cousin that it is HH. I then challenged him if there were security cameras so we can check the time stamp. I was fuming at the point because 1. No ownership of your mistakes 2. No empathy or even care that your customer is upset/ don't even bother to have DIALOGUE to discuss problem, just point fingers as if I'm wrong. And then just charging us the full price instead of honoring your HH.   I need to make a disclaimer here: I am someone who believes is tipping and I will almost ALWAYS leave 20% regardless of how the food turns out, IF there is ANY customer service. ROB is incredible in that he DGAF.  It's upsetting that a place as fancy and nice as this sushi restaurant lacks so much in their customer service. What a bummer to this Vegas trip. Maybe it was a bad night, but I wouldn't take my chances here with the long wait, salty sushi, and price overcharge/shadiness in NOT HONORING YOUR HH."}
{"text":"The happy hour here is pretty sweet. Sake and Kirin is $6 during happy hour as well as a plethora of sushi and appetizers for half off. I got gyoza, shrimp tempura roll, california roll, and their wings and didn't spend more than $15. Everything tasted good and the service was pretty good. We were lucky to find parking right out front but it looked like it could be an issue on a busy night. Sit outside. You can people watch and enjoy the beauty of Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Slow service, food subpar, friendly staff though and great location if you're outdoors and watch the choice boys and girls walk by on the strip. There is a fairly diverse menu though, it's not just sushi ^..^  Transfriendly- yea def, you'll be ok. they thrive on tourists so all types of folk."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was great, with beautiful bar tenders and servers however the management has a lot to be desired.   We had four and one of us order beef teriyaki and the rest of us rolls and sushi.   The beef teriyaki came out 10 minutes before the rolls and the rolls came out 10 minutes before the sushi.  It was very uncomfortable when the only non sushi eater finished his meal before the rest of us started.   I spoke to the server who brought the manager.   The manager explained that they had been in business 14 years and their customers had learned to live with it.   Plus if they tried to coordinate the sushi bar and kitchen it would slow the sushi down 45 minutes, which made no sense to me. Anyway I wouldn't recommend going there if you have a non-sushi eater at your table."}
{"text":"So I dont really go to main stream restaurants in Vegas since there are so many unique, only one type spots but today was an exception. We were going to shop at fashion show, felt like sushi so viola!  We arrived and it was pretty empty so we were seates right away. Greeted by our server fairly quickly he took our drink and app order. We tried a few things but the ahi poke tarts stood out. Imagine a small fruit tart but with poke, avocado and ponzu sauce. Yum!!!  We had ordered a few rolls which came out pretty quick. I ordered a sashimi salad which took quite awhile to come out, which was odd BC it was just sashimi, lettuce and ponzu sauce, a bit too much sauce.   Our server was attentive to a point."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best gyoza I've had.  Exceptional taste and a little crisp to it.  Only wish they had some chili oil and soy sauce.  I also tried the chicken katsu.  It wasn't the best but wasn't bad.  The reason for the four stars is the waitress was a wreck.  She spilled soy sauce all over the table when she first came to the table. Didn't clean it up just left a trail on the table.  It got all over the menu, table, glasses, everything.  I think half the container spilled out.  She only had two tables but seemed to give the impression she had 15.  Had to ask for rice with my chicken.  Thought that was a little  weird.  Never got a refill on my drink and she didn't ask my wife if she wanted anything.  Had to stop her before she left the table to give her her order.  Is that asking too much?  Give it a try for the food just be careful of who is serving you."}
{"text":"I wouldn't pick it but I like it.   They have these wasabi mashed potatoes that are awesome. and these sesame ginger hot wings that are awesome. Their tempura veggies are pretty great. I am so that girl who picks all of the random happy hour menu items and eats it as a meal.   I don't really like seafood so I struggle with sushi. I like it when it's covered in wasabi and drenched in soy sauce- to the point where you can't taste it.   in fact, i once said 'I am a pussy eater' while dining at RA. In my mind that translated to 'i can only handle wimpy sushi like california rolls so please stop asking me to try your octopus salad' but that is NOT what it translated to everyone else, and i am sure i will never hear the end of it.   I only go during happy hour because it's freakin expensive! and i don't even like it enough to eat an entire roll so i'm usually starving within a few hours."}
{"text":"Service was great, and on top of that the hot mess I ordered was a must have! As for the sushi the rolls were a nice size & not too full of sauce I had the Vegas & we also had the tempura calamari, however I wasn't a huge fan of it even though it was delicious just wasn't my favorite! Oh it's always a plus to be seated fast at a sushi place it was a very pleasant left me wanting to come again soon experience!"}
{"text":"Food was sensational for happy hour, great deals too. But my boyfriend and I had a hipster Ryan Gosling doppelgänger waiter with a lot of attitude. HE got our drink orders wrong and then I was immediately able to visualize him rolling his eyes and shaking his head at our request. Massively unprofessional.  Also, I don't entirely appreciate restaurants assessing that we are a young couple and think we're willing to sit at the most undesirable tables. We were out right at the entrance, by a window, with invasive foot traffic that took away from our conversation."}
{"text":"RA is my mine and my boyfriends favorite place to eat. We always have AMAZING servers and they always take the time to chat with us and make sure we are having a pleasant experience. Also a plus that it's right next to the movie theater so we can have a full date night!"}
{"text":"WHHHHHHY am I a glutton for punishment?! After going to the movies, we thought we'd go enjoy some sushi. RA was the walking distance option. After walking into the loud club-like atmosphere, we chose to sit at the bar for the experience with the Sushi Chef. After watching some children left unattended playing at the sushi bar; a server walked up and asked for our drink order. He then explained that since the Sushi Chef's get too much attention and \"step on our (servers) toes we now order through us\". (Typically if you eat at the bar, you order with the Sushi Chef and bypass the server). After ordering three sushi rolls, we sat and tried to have a conversation. The music was so loud and distracting that it took away from the enjoyment that could have occurred. All throughout our meal, we were interrupted by our server chatting it up about his personal preferences while reaching across us for the plates. I'm assuming that the manager didn't explain to the server how to clean up and not physically put your body on top of the customer repeatedly.  Overall, the food was bland and UNDERwhelming, typically priced and will not be tasted again by us. Thanks RA for reminding me that true quality is not something you shoot for."}
{"text":"The sushi is great... never had a problem. Food is always good and out quickly.   Glad they have Stella Artois here to wash down my food ;)"}
{"text":"So embarrassing. I showed up without my wallet and was freaking out. Already ordered beer and edamame. We've been there many times and the manager could sense my anguish. He said don't worry about it, come back tomorrow and pay, \"just enjoy your night\". Holy crap that took me by surprise. Great manager.. Name is Robert."}
{"text":"Food isn't especially good, but I love their HH. I think they recently raised the price on their HH, but still good.  Usually go for some sake bombs and I think it is called the Vegas Roll... with the lobster and lotus root on it. Delicious.  Good place to hang out after work and just chill. Kinda loud and busy place, but a fun environment with outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Oh wow, late night food as I didn't have time for dinner earlier. Amazing sushi! Octopus and unagi is on point!"}
{"text":"I've been to RA about a dozen times and I can't believe I have never written a review!  The best thing about RA (and only reason to go in my opinion) is their Happy hour.  From 3-7, just about all their appetizers and a good portion of their sushi is  1/2 price.  Now being a vegetarian, it's hard to get excited about a veggie roll, but they also have some great appetizers:  pineapple cream cheese wontons, veggie tempura, and my favorite which is their Dengaku Tofu.  It's a huge tray of tofu which is prepared  a little crispy and is drizzled with a sweet and tangy sauce that I just love.   Their drink specials are also a steal... I tend to go with either $2 hot sake, a $5 cosmo, or some combination of the two when I'm feeling frisky!"}
{"text":"RA, while a chain that we could have gone to in Chicago, has great late night happy hour specials, yummy tempura and solid sushi. None of that rolls falling apart crap that makes it hard to eat. I most drank, it being my last night in Vegas and me being broke. My wine was good and cheap, and my friends got vodka sevens for 5 bucks.   Just wait, after 10 pm they host a late night happy hour, and offer superb drink specials, like a pint sized Tsunami for only $4. You don't need more than three of those to get more than a buzz.   The bartender was great - very nice and willing to take our picture and even take a picture with us. He didn't speak the best of English and was still so accommodating.   I don't normally like going to chains when I'm on vacation, but RA was a good choice."}
{"text":"I can't remember the last time I was here. It must have been years ago! RA brings back such great memories of my first Sake Bomb, or should I say my first 12 sake bombs!!    The strip is a little out of my way but I was at the Fashion Show mall and decided to give their happy hour another try. I was a little disappointed to see that it wasn't the same HH menu and that the prices weren't that different from the original prices. Honestly, it almost made me change my mind to get up and walk to Kona instead.   However, their spicy tuna was calling my name and boy was it tasty! I'm glad I stayed. Our server, Bethany was also really nice and sweet too! She recommended some really great rolls and was super patient as we stared at the menu deciding on why to get.   The atmosphere is very chill and relaxing. I recommend sitting outside. It's great!"}
{"text":"2016  Rocking shrimp appetizer- 9 different than a dynamite but very good.  spicy lobster roll- 7+ yummy but very small crazy monkey roll- 4 I didn't like Thai one   ice tea- lightly infused (not like the 10's but great)"}
{"text":"I always like to find sushi restaurants when I travel, and based on Yelp reviews and the location of RA on the Strip, I decided to eat here.  I was disappointed, both by the staff and by the food.  The happy hour menu offers some lower prices before 7pm every day, so my wife and I got to the restaurant at around 6:15pm to make sure we ordered off the happy hour menu.  Most of the regular menu prices are just too high to justify ordering.   Some of the food items were discounted more than others, but I was very disappointed that there are NO sushi rolls with ahi tuna on the happy hour menu.  The only tuna roll on the happy hour menu is the Pacific Roll, which has albacore tuna.  We ordered the Pacific Roll, along with a spicy salmon roll, some salmon sashimi, and a spicy tuna-crispy rice appetizer.  The salmon sashimi was the best of all the menu items we tried, and the only item that we would absolutely order again (it's also the one that's based most on the fish and least on the quality of the chefs).  The spicy salmon roll and spicy tuna appetizers were average.  The Pacific roll, on the other hand, was terrible.  The albacore tuna tasted like it came from a can, and I could not finish the roll. Our waiter was also pretty bad.  He started off by sitting on the table next to us while taking our order, not just leaning against the table, but actually sitting on the eating surface.  I almost felt like telling the people who sat there after he got up, and I wondered if he also sat on our table.  Once our server took our order, he disappeared into the back or just chatted with other employees the whole time.  When we were done eating, I had to flag down a buss-boy to ask for our check, and when the server brought it to us, he disappeared again for over 10 minutes before he picked up the credit card.  He then went to go chat and joke with some other employees for about ten minutes BEFORE he even ran my card through the machine.   With the combination of high prices, lack of selection on the happy hour menu, bad tasting rolls, and bad service, I will not be back here again."}
{"text":"We came here on a thursday night and the place was pretty dead.  Got seating on the patio right away.  The service seemed a little shoddy but we were quite pleased with our meal.  For our 2nd round of drinks the waitress doubled the size of the glasses which was a nice bonus.  A pint of mojito is always a good way to go.  The tootsy roll is a must try, i love tempura crumbs and eel sauce.  I wish i had tried the lobster spring rolls but we have a Ra in Chicago so i guess if I felt really compelled I could go there to try them."}
{"text":"Happy hour review: top notch deals.  No, the sushi is not special.  Did you expect it to be in a mall in Las Vegas?  Really pleasantly surprised by the HH: I had spicy chicken wings, 2 decent, if forgettable,  rolls & a beer for $15.  I actually ordered a Miller Lite in keeping with the spirit of maximizing the deal.  When in Rome...  Many of the appetizers on the menu sounded like friend bites of asian bar food goodness I'd like to try.  The (very sweet!) waitress was trying to sell the 'most popular' apps, something involving lobster fritters or wontons or whatnot.  All sounded like artery clogging goodness.  I am always in the market for a reasonable meal in LV & think this would be a really fun place to wile away an afternoon with friends that doesn't involve gambling."}
{"text":"Quick service, pretty place and great sushi"}
{"text":"This is a great find. Good sushi at a reasonable price. Especially for Vegas strip. And the service is amazing!  My server, Tammy, was outstanding both with recommendations and service. I always try to visit when I'm in town. Make sure to visit them during Happy Hour as well. Good drink and sushi specials."}
{"text":"This location is right on Mill ave., which as plenty of restaurants to pick from but we wanting something a bit different. Had been to Ra in Tucson, so wanted to give this a try. Stopped in here early on a Friday night. Pretty empty, but quickly filled up. Went out back to the bar area, which has a small out door seating for table service. Bar tender was great ( he gets a four star rating), efficient, and attentive without being overly so. Sushi was fresh and reasonable (happy hour pricing). The inside was bit dark for my taste so eating outside was preferred. Only draw back was outdoors they allow smoking. Tempe needs to ban smoking in any bar and restaurant. The bar staff is very professional and inviting."}
{"text":"I always have great service here. Their happy hour is banging, and the employees are nice to look at. I've never had a bad experience here.  The bathrooms are a little creepy though. You have to go through a separate door in the back, but besides that everything here is delicious and filling.  Also, if you check in on Foursquare, they will give you free edamame or miso soup. So don't forget to show it to your waiter!"}
{"text":"Greatly enjoyed dinner a few nights ago at RA!!! The sushi and sides were great and who doesn't enjoy washing down dinner with a fish bowl sized cocktail? Service was attentive and outdoor seating very comfortable for a hot desert night."}
{"text":"My now husband and I held our wedding reception (we had a Japanese theme) at this RA sushi location. Everything was absolutely magical. Richard, the manager, was infinitely generous, helpful, and patient with our catering. We were able to rope off part of the restaurant for our celebration. There was a designated staff of 2 or 3 servers and we could even decorate as we pleased. All of our 45 guests couldn't stop talking about how awesome the food was and how beautiful the decor was! Delicious and unique appetizers such as the pineapple cheese wontons and yakitori skewers and the delicious iced tea really won everyone over. Thank you so much RA staff for making my wedding day so special! You're \"RA\"-some! We will never forget it. :)"}
{"text":"Date night on a Friday evening we came from CG and I said lets just get off on Ray Rd and eat some where random. Sushi was the pick. The atmosphere was awesome and our waitress Samantha was very attentive and helpful. We enjoyed 2 appetizers a cucumber salad & edamame wontons & Viva Las Vegas Roll & Tootsy Maki Roll a margarita for me and all under $50. We definitely will be going on. Sushi was great"}
{"text":"I am SO glad i didn't listen to my friends and booked a dinner at Rushi Roku as well while I was in town.  My friends are Phoenix/Scottsadle locals and told me that Ra is the place to be, but after we had a girls lunch here, I am so glad I didn't have dinner here as well.  The decor is standard but the food is pretty average.  However, the prices are very reasonable for lunch.  They have this huge fruity alcoholic that's fun to share.  The food was pretty average - I had some unagi sushi, shared the skewer appetizers, and had a sushi/sashimi box for lunch.  I was disappointed since our friends were raving about this place, but then again, they're not really sushi eaters (more of the California roll types).  For people who like sushi/sashimi, I would go elsewhere if you're looking for more unique fishes like yellowtail, etc... - you will get better quality elsewhere."}
{"text":"I got the worst food poisoning of my life from eating the sushi here. I almost had to go to the hospital. This was three days ago and I'm still woozy writing this."}
{"text":"Horrible service we waited over 10 mins to be assisted and waited over 40 minutes for our food. Half the order was wrong and the other half was not even submitted. We also were never checked on to see how things are going. This was around a non peak time."}
{"text":"Pretty good but took a very long time. presentation was simple and clean. I enjoyed it, but the wait was ridiculous. I can't imagine how long it would take if it was lunch hour."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and a lot cheaper than other food on the strip!  Lots of great $6 options, perfect if you're trying to save money and want to avoid fast food!"}
{"text":"Wish I had one of these where I live.  Stopped in for some sushi and was happy to see they had a happy hour menu.  Katie was our server (awesome, by the way) and she suggested some items on the menu.  We wound up having the potstickers, seaweed salad, tootsy maki rool, rainbow roll and the viva las vegas roll.  All of them were amazing.  Plus, the beers were on the cheap, too.  Great environment, quality sushi and super service.  I'd definitely go back!  It was too hot to sit outside, but it looked like it would be fun in the cooler months.  Parking was decent on a Saturday night at 5 pm.  Pros=great quality, fun atmosphere, everyone's pretty Cons=none really... just that there's no Ra's in Arkansas"}
{"text":"Overpriced Sushi, and not so good. Just a popular hangout but without much merit for food or comfort."}
{"text":"food was just okay but our bartender/server Miguel was super.  He was very attentive and he asked if our drinks were strong enough.  He was willing give us extra liquor."}
{"text":"The music was so loud the waitress couldn't even hear the order. My aunt gave the waitress a card which listed her allergies and even explained what she's allergic to. The waitress did not take the card to the chef and came back with a dish that contained crab and when my aunt became extremely sick the waitress nor the restaurant took any action to fix the situation."}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to go here because I always heard from a friend that she loved this place.   1.i ordered 4 sushi rolls for nearly $50. I ordered a Vegas roll, crunch roll, and the other 2 I don't remember but I didn't like them. 2. I waited a long time. 3. The Vegas rolls were very good but the other rolls weren't very fresh."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 4 star because of location and convinces. It located at Fashion Show Mall, which is right next to Treasure Island. I wanted sushi on my last trip to Vegas, but didn't want to leave the strip. I ask a friend if there was any good sushi place on the strip and she suggested this place, but she said it kind of pricey. Lucky for me we came on a Sunday during Happy Hour and the prices were actually good.   I give the food 3 Star. It was good, but nothing special. Lucky I came during happy hour cause I wouldn't think it worth the full price. However there presentation is worth 4 stars it nice and very elegant. We order most of the things on the Happy hour menu and they were all good. I wouldn't order the Sashimi because it wasn't worth the price we paid since it wasn't on the Happy Hour menu, but I like Sashimi, but what we got wasn't good.   The place look very nice and hip. It a good place for a group of friends to hang out at. We had a table and later ask to be moved to the booth because the rest of our group hadn't show up yet and a booth was free. They moved us quickly and didn't have a problem with it. Services was good and everyone was nice. There was a DJ and if you wanted it to be less noisy you can sit out in the patio area where it more quited.   I give there drinks a 4 Stars it was good and Strong and they have a lot of selection in drinks,  they are a little costly, but it is Vegas."}
{"text":"Super. Great on all aspects. Come and try!  Came here on Christmas Day and food was delicious. Incredible tacos, sushi and sashimi fresh and tasty. A superb experience."}
{"text":"We went for a lunch there and scared by one of the reviewers from citysearch who said that fish tasted fishy, ordered only a couple of sushi pieces (salmon + tuna), pork goyza and shrimp tempura roll. Fortunately sushi were pretty good (fresh thin-cut fish, properly sized pieces, rice was not too sticky & not too heavy); unfortunately, the service was pretty slow (we saw only 1 cook at the counter who was giving preference to people sitting at the bar), so we didn't end up ordering more as we couldn't wait 30 minutes more for our order to arrive. After all, it was a lunch time. Shrimp tempura roll was also good w a unique touch - asparagus instead of avocado, but they gave only 6 small pieces and the last piece was half size.  Atmosphere is not romantic at all, loud music is blasting and you will see lots of ASU students. I would give this place a try but I think it's a little bit overpriced (e.g. around $5 for 2 pieces of tuna), so if you have a good sushi place next to your home, you won't find anything special at RA bar. I would rather go to Sapporo in Scottsdale (also loud music ;)) instead of this RA bar in Tempe, but if I'm around the area, I will have dinner/lunch. Btw no lunch special at this place, at least none was offered by our cute waitress ;)   P.S. We went there in August 2006"}
{"text":"First off, it Isn't closed during construction! Don't miss this gem on the strip. Amazing prices whether it's happy hour or not, but particularly awesome during happy hour. I arrived at 6:40 on Wednesday after booking it from the flamingo to make it in time for happy hour, only to find that happy hour is extended on Wednesdays- SCORE!   Jenny was my waitress and I can't say enough positive things about her- patient, kind, and altogether a nice gal. I got a dragon bite to drink...for 7 bucks, it definitely didn't disappoint- tasty and stout!   I had the tootsy maki, Las Vegas roll, and seaweed salad for dinner. Extremely fast and very tasty. I also had a hot sake- a steal at 3.75 and not too bad. Too bad I didn't have room for dessert. After a quick stroll around fashion show shops, I returned for another sake before my show. Much to my surprise it was covered by the manager since I mentioned I was back for more! The bartender, Jamie, was so friendly and helpful. I will be back again at least once during my five night stay, and will definitely return again if I return to Vegas. Great job, Ra! This spot is a can't miss when trying to dine on a budget while still enjoying fresh, tasty food."}
{"text":"Two words: Happy Hour. I dunno when it starts but it ends at 7pm.  This was my second time at RA at this location. Consistently we've had a great experience. Service was quick; I swear everyone had something to eat about 10 minutes after we ordered. Surprisingly, we didn't drink this time so I can't really say much about the alcohol, but the two dishes I ordered, the Dengaku (sp?) tofu and the short ribs, were both tasty and a great value for the money. I think I spent a grand total of $12 and I couldn't even finish all my food. The tofu might have been a little salty for some palettes but I didn't mind it.  One strange thing though: miso soup wasn't on the happy hour menu and therefore was $4 a cup. huh? EXCEPT turns out that if you check in with your smartphone you can get it for free. We figured this out too late and never got our soup haha, oh well. Learn from our mistake yelpers!"}
{"text":"Hmmmm I'm big on customer service. I was seated ready to rate RA with one star because the hostess was so horrible and made us feel unwelcomed. Maybe she had a bad day but I just didn't appreciate her attitude. BUT then luckily we were seated in Jared's section. I had to ask his name because he was the best server I had my entire trip. He's truly awesome. WHY?... well of course my friends and I were really indecisive and he left and actually came back to check on us instead of us having to flag him down. Then the menu had no pictures and a friend of mine wanted a roll with \"red stuff\" on top of it. He was awesome enough to grab the book from the back that had pictures and descriptions to find the exact roll she was talking about.  The food was good. Especially the avocado rolls. Some of the other rolls were too spicy, my friend's loved them.  So to sum it up. Food was good and don't let the hostess scare u away."}
{"text":"I came with the family for a last-night dinner, the sushi was great!  We sat outside which I didn't prefer, but the music inside was so loud that I couldn't imagine even having a conversation, I don't think that the \"Zen\" of eating sushi blends well with suburbia-type loud music.  The service was nice and non-intrusive, they have a nicely decorated interior, but if you want to actually talk to your family you better sit outside and watch the cars drive by!"}
{"text":"I feel the more I explore with sushi restaurants, ra is the one that is always disappointing . The sushi is mediocre. I enjoy going there only for sake bombing. I wish they would use better quality for the sushi"}
{"text":"This place was great super fast service. Patrick our waiter was fast, friendly and best server ever. Great food we got the Cali roll, rainbow roll, some others and all were good and were affordable."}
{"text":"My son picked us up a couple of bento boxes today for lunch. It was supposed to come with a serving of rice, which was not included in either. The tempura shrimp were the size of a very small thin French Fry and everything tasted like it was fried in old ,old frying oil.  I am really, really dissatisfied.  Then to add insult to injury, we called to tell them about not receiving rice. We were told they would provide a credit for one bento box."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, horrible service, followed by half our table not getting their food until an hour later, then complete lack of service, then full plate of apathy, and to complete the dinner, some lame excuses for the kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and all of my experiences have been very similar.   First, the food: 4 Stars. Everything I've tasted is good! I'm a sucker for the Gojira roll and Boyfriend gets the Viva Las Vegas roll. The appetizers are tasty and the nigiri doesn't seem to disappoint. The tempura-fried ice cream is one of my all-time favorite desserts. However, I'd like a bit more bang for my buck. We know to come here when we're not super hungry, since we can't afford to stuff ourselves here. It's a nice date-night treat though.   Second, the service: 3 Stars. It definitely leaves something to be desired. It's not that the waitresses are unfriendly; it's more an issue with the timing of the meal. It's not at all uncommon for one diner to have finished their roll before another diner receives theirs. Given that, in my case, all the food is ordered (and should be put into the kitchen) at the same time, it should all come out together. Even a delay of a couple of minutes is fine, but 15-20 minutes? Not acceptable.  *For those of you doing the math and wondering why RA gets 1 star, not the 3.5 star average you'd assume based on the above, read on:  There is one thing that RA could do to turn this 1 star review into a 4 star one. It's incredibly simple and won't cost them a dime. For the love of all things holy, TURN THE MUSIC DOWN! It's so loud that you have to yell in order to be heard by the person sitting next to you. It's obnoxious and serves no purpose. Loud music is great, but not when you're trying to have a nice dinner and, you know, speak to your dining buddy.  All in all, despite actually wanting to go back (as I said, date-night treat!), we won't be returning until the music is turned down. It really, really kills what would otherwise be a perfectly wonderful dining experience. RA, please fix!!!"}
{"text":"average white american sushi, service was average. Music is definitely a genre that I have on my dmp but DAMN Loud. The waitress couldn't hear me as I answered her question. I get trying to be on the front line but quite a joke."}
{"text":"Too bad there is not an option for NO stars...Meeting clients for lunch, my associate and I were seated in the back, on the left in one of the middle booths. First red flag should have been that the back of the booth upholstered back and seat cushion had at least a 1\" gap, exposing the wood frame its built on. We both sit down on one side, facing the back door. Waitress and trainee were very nice and got us water. After sitting for about 5 minutes, something catches my eye, I look down and in my lap is a COCKROACH!!!! I kid you not! I hit it out of my lap onto floor, and managed not to scream which is a miracle. I immediately got up and told my associate and waitress, quietly. Had to stay because we were meeting clients, moved to front table to white knuckle it through this meeting! I will never, ever go back."}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was poor.   I had miso soup, great flavor just excessive green onions. The side salad had tasty dressing, however the lettuce could have been more fresh. We had the veggie tempura, it was all very greasy. The veggies were well cooked and the dipping sauce was tasty. The caterpillar roll was beautifully made, the seaweed element was a little chewy. I didn't have a cocktail, my friends said they enjoyed theirs.   The service was slow. We asked for things but the server was in such a hurry he didn't hear. It makes no sense to get one person's order and not ask the entire table if anyone needs anything else. It took an exceptional amount of time for my friends to get their cocktails. And it took too long to get the check, even after we asked a hostess walking by if we could get it quickly since we were headed to a movie. The server was a very friendly person.   I would go back for the food and because it's close to the theater. If I sat in dining again I would lower my expectations of prompt service."}
{"text":"Holy crap, people actually eat here?  The last several times I've been to this RA, I can gauge my level of intoxication between pretty buzzed to blackout-absolutely wasted.  As you can tell, neither I nor any of my compatriots make it a point to actually dine here, mainly drink.  That's right, awesome happy hour and on Sunday night it's Service Industry Night (aka happy hour on Sunday night).  The happy hour menu is pretty extensive with appetizers ranging from the standard california roll to gyoza, seafood dynamite, and coconut shrimp skewer things.  However, where RA truly shines is it's specials on alcohol.  Food may be ordered when the hunger arises concurrently with inebriation, but at that point it doesn't matter if it's just so-so or even sub-par (it's like having beer goggles, but for food, not chicks).  However, I can't give this place a complete crap rating because of all the wonderful drunken memories I've had here (the few times I actually remembered the outings/the first half of the outing)."}
{"text":"Good sushi place, had some unique creations. The \"Ra\"ckin roll was delicious. Service was decent, atmosphere was pretty happening. We aren't from the area, but we would come back if we were in town again."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, good sushi, and great sake bombs! Oh...and I love the music!"}
{"text":"Aha so its a chain....took me a while to find the one I ate at.   Little Sissa introduced me to this popotrendy sushi place that plays the great hits of U2 and other rock bands overhead in a dimly lit setting, which I suppose enhances the sensual consumption of weak Saki sangria and standard sushi selections.   Pretty great deal for the price: only 30$ for two.  After a modest meal of salty rice covered thingies (I have no idea what I'm eating at these places) I was shamed to order the Cinnamon fried ice cream ball which was big enough to feed a family of 3 alone.  Isn't that a Mexican dish?  I'm confused.  Crowded and I'm sure fantastic for the college crowd."}
{"text":"I really only go here during happy hour.  I like the Tsunami Punch, vegetable tempura, calamari, pot stickers, Saki Bombers, California Roll, Tootsie Maki.  It's impossible to have a conversation with someone due to the loud music."}
{"text":"I have always heard bad things about Ra so I never wanted to make it a place to dine for sushi... I do think that most negative comments were referring to the location in Scottsdale if that makes any difference.  So what brought me to Ra was a team dinner with my coworkers.  The drinks I had were a little sweet than I usually like, but still good.  We were sat right away and the service was attentive... everything I had sushi wise was very good.  I enjoyed this much more than what I had at Kobe Japanese Steakhouse & Tepan & Sushi.  I would agree with other reviewers that the music is really loud and kind of out of place for a sushi restaurant.  In fact when we first arrived the music was at a normal level and then at some point they really cranked it up so then you kind of had to shout at the people in your party.  Other than that I really enjoyed the sushi and would come back for lunch since my office is close."}
{"text":"FOOD I ordered the assorted vegetable tempura appetizer (came with asparagus, sweet potato, green beans) and the chili ponzu yellowtail roll. The vegetable tempura appetizer was pretty good and they were very generous with the number of pieces they served. The chili ponzu yellowtail roll contained spicy yellowtail, cucumber, avocado, jalapeno, cilantro, and garlic and was served with a chili ponzu sauce. I wasn't really a fan of the sauce, but they do serve it on the side! The roll itself was pretty standard in taste.  My friend ordered the Dinner Sashimi Assortment; which I believe came with tuna, salmon, yellowtail, and another type of fish along with rice and miso soup! I was so sad that find out that she had found bones in her some pieces of her fish. I know that my friend does enjoy eating sashimi, so I felt super bad that she had to experience those bones while eating. It would totally take away from my dining experience.     PRICING To be completely honest, I was pretty surprised when my friend and I sat down and looked at the menu. I expected their dishes to cost a lot more as expected on the Strip. However, the prices were pretty average for a sushi place! I believe the vegetable tempura appetizer was about $6 and the yellowtail roll was about $12.     SERVICE The service here was really attentive. Our server came to check in on us and asked if we needed anything as he passed by our seating area. I am also really glad that the manager gave my friend a discount on her sashimi plate as she had found bones in her fish."}
{"text":"We gave it two stars cause the food is still on point.  Tried the Gojira Roll and it lived up to our expectations.  Very Yummy.  That said, this restaurant needs help cosmetically.  We sat in a booth towards the back that straight up smelled like urine.  The vinyl on the bench was also torn up so every time they must have wiped the seat, moisture was getting down into the padding.  Needless to say, I sat in something wet and it was gross and it was on top of the pee smell.  Add sticky tables and a general emptiness on a Saturday night and I would have decided to go anywhere else at all."}
{"text":"The food was not fresh.  A platter of sushi/sashimi came out and it was very cold to the touch, we wiped frozen water slivers around the food.   The yummy looking seared tuna was heavily dipped in peanut dressing, topped with an old piece of leafy greens.  Drinks - any sweet cocktail is available   Pricy & not worth your buck."}
{"text":"We were headed out of town and looking to get a great dinner before hitting the road. Grimaldi's and Bandera both had an hour wait so we decided to stop into RA. They had no wait (now I know why). Their sushi was mediocre.. at best, and quite pricey. It didn't taste as fresh as I would have liked, and the flavors didn't seem to stand out as much as they should have. The miso soup was my favorite part of the meal. I will not be back to this location. I like the one in Vegas for happy hour, but I'll pass on the food."}
{"text":"I've been here twice! I absolutely love the Crispy Spicy Tuna - can't get enough of it! I would recommend sitting outside on a nice day. Definitely one of my local favorites."}
{"text":"I would give this review 5 stars but the food got me and my friend sick. Earlier today, we went to RA to enjoy the happy hour. The server was great and prompt and we otherwise had a good time. My friend and I ordered the Garlic Ponzu Yellowtail, which tasted delicious and we were the only two that ordered it. Soon after my meal was done I immediately had to use the bathroom as my food did not agree with me and I had a bout of diarrhea. My friend later had diarrhea ( an hour later) as it affected us at different times.This our first night in Vegas and so it took us out for a few hours. I just woke up and my friend did too as we feel out of it. We are positive that was the culprit in our demise of a mini food poisoning case as we were the only two that bought that dish and it was our first real meal since we just got here. I recommend they check that dish out or the fish as something in it made us feel pretty terrible."}
{"text":"The four stars are primarily for the dark, cool, comforting ambiance and the consistently outstanding job done by the serving staff. The sushi is also commendable, better than most of the local sushi places which are mediocre at best. I just wish they would stop using those bland white papers to wrap the hand rolls instead of seaweed.  Update: they now give you a choice of soy paper or seaweed for the hand roll wraps. Yay! Plus their sushi has been pushing five stars lately."}
{"text":"I almost didn't try this place because of the mediocre reviews...however, I'm very glad we decided to have dinner here recently. The atmosphere is fun and lively without being too loud to have a conversation, and we really enjoyed sitting at the sushi bar and watching the chefs make sushi.  Service was quick, the drinks were good, and the food was delicious. We enjoyed the spicy salmon roll and the viva las vegas roll. Their menu offers many enticing and creative special rolls, which is what I enjoy most. The crispy whitefish asian tacos were unique and amazing. The happy hour and reverse happy hour deals are amazing...best value I've found in Scottsdale for such an enjoyable sushi dinner & drinks."}
{"text":"This place hasn't changed in the years since I went to ASU, but why change a good thing? It's still packed to the gills and doing the same things it's always done. Pretty good service and food, and an incredible viewing area for hip, good-looking or wannabe hot people. It's fun if the only person you care to communicate with is your date, otherwise it's cruddy. The music is ok though! Just don't plan any romantic dinners here, at least not on the weekend!  Go to see and be seen, and have a roll or two- they aren't bad at all."}
{"text":"After reading through some of the other reviews, I've learned that if I am going to open up a business with average food, I better not have below average service. Here's the thing, either you need to have excellent customer service or excellent food because that way people can rationalize, \"well, their service is bad, but they have amazing food \" or vice versa. It's unfortunate that this sushi restaurant which is in a great location has neither.  I had sushi for lunch today at Four Seasons - small place in Gilbert...and then I had sushi again for dinner at RA. And I couldn't tell the different in tastes. I do prefer the RA ambiance - mood lighting with plenty of seating, but it's not a place I would suggest meeting up a bunch of friends to watch the game or even a birthday party.   Happy hour pricing is what drives me in and I'm sure the majority of it's patrons as well. The waitress was attentive when it came to ordering our food, but after the fod came out she never stopped by to refill my water. And I never got my California Roll. However, she was nice enough to wrap up a complimentary cali roll for me to take home - so I will say that was the main reason why I upgraded this review to 2 stars. Its never too late to start caring about your customer and I actually do appreciate that she made the effort at the very end. My friends and I were very surprised when she did this because the service up to that point had been subpar.  Anyways, average food at an average price *during happy hour* with subpar to average customer service. 3 stars sounds about right."}
{"text":"Had dinner there last night, first experience was decent, sat us in the far back where there were NO people whatsoever.  That was okay because the music that night was so loud that we loved the break.  Anyways, the sushi chefs are nice, and mean well, its the waitresses that need an attitude adjustment.   Customer service needs help."}
{"text":"We went for Valentine's Day a day late to avoid the crowds and were delighted to enjoy a very tame atmosphere. Apparently on Sunday there is a pick 4 sushi rolls for two people to share for $25 special. Out of the four we picked, only one was WOW awesome. The other three were average. Server was VERY attentive and we didnt lament for anything while we were there. Kinda annoying to have to put up with those people who insist on bringing their ratdogs to dinner with them yapping away, but at Dana Park its just the type of clientele they get."}
{"text":"I was introduced to RA Sushi by my friend Rich at the iStore. He offered up lunch and who am I to refuse! :)  They have a very broad selection for the hard core sushi fan and the mildly experimental sushi boy (or girl).  The service was great. Food was also terrific. If you're not a sushi fan, no worries. The menu is very accommodating and you'll find something on there you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp miso which was described on the menu as containing veggies amongst other things. I asked to replace the tofu with mushrooms, but when the soup was delivered it was essentially a ridiculously spicy broth (coming from a New Orleans born spice lover) with tofu and no mushrooms or any other vegetables for that matter.   I would be embarrassed if I was the owner of this restaurant. The menu is definitely a smoking mirror for what actually is delivered. Never ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Im building my happy hour list and I cant have a happy hour list without RA or Kona! :)   RA is delicious...I will say it is expensive if outside of happy hour....but during happy hour the value is great.  A large selection of drinks (Sake bomb is usually the most popular) and a large selection of discounted items including their famous Vegas roll which is my favorite.  I also recommend the crunchy spicy tuna roll....its a ball of deepfried rice with a tuna tartar ontop....very good stuff.  I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good sushi happy hour."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times because my friend who works nearby likes to come here late-night.  Everytime we came late, provided it was still open, the food was pretty good.  My most recent visit, which was last week during happy hour, was pretty bad.  I will start with the bad.  The happy hour menu was cheap enough, but only had about 10 things to choose from.  The sushi we ordered was fine, nothing special, but anything that came out of the fryer was terrible.  The crab cakes were absolute crabp.  The fried spicy tuna roll was not edible.  At the end of the day, I would have rather paid full price for food I could eat than half price for food I cannot.  Even at full price, I recommend paying a bit more and eating at a top-notch sushi spot, which Vegas has a lot of.  Again, the past visits were not bad, just not great.  I would have given 3 stars until my most recent visit.  The location is on the frontage of the Fashion Show Mall, just across from Wynn.  They have indoor and outdoor seating.  No reservations are needed and they don't seem to have a dress code.  Park at Fashion Show in self-park or valet, or walk from your hotel."}
{"text":"Good sushi, garlic edamame was amazing.  I still think Ra is overrated.   Not the best, not the worst"}
{"text":"I have been here numerous times and the food is fresh, good, and tasty. The staff is always polite and helpful. I also think I have never waited long than 10 minutes for a table. The happy hour and lunch specials are great and they are always willing to work the menu a bit for our 8 year old son. Cost is incredibly reasonable as well."}
{"text":"I literally have not been here for years but my cousin is in town and she wanted a California Roll. LOL. SO I thought of RA because I knew it wouldn't be overly expensive and Hunnie Bunnie was rollin with us. We got there before happy hour was over, and we were sat in the dining room. I ordered the White Sake Sangria was was very tasty. Angie had her California roll which she seemed to love and we shared some Shishito Peppers and Spicy Sesame Chicken Wings and Edamame. Everything was great! Hunnie Bunnie had some Miso Soup and a big ass bowl of Udon Noodles. The only things is, if the Udon Noodles had BROTH in it, it would have been a little better I think but otherwise, no complaints!  I used to come here ALL THE WAY waaaaaaaaaaaay back for happy hour - it's a great spot on the strip for some cheap, GOOD eats, and the service was good as well. NIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICE LIKE IIIIIIIIIIIIIICE!!!"}
{"text":"Good sushi not great. Be ready to break the bank a little, especially if you get an alcoholic drink. For the \"good sushi\" you get I don't think it is worth the bill. With the location right on Mill Ave, I guess you'd be hard pressed to go somewhere else if you're really craving sushi."}
{"text":"I've been dining at and take away at this location for years. The service has always been great. The vibes in the restaurant have always been chill and relaxed; and this is definitely a fresh and trendy sushi bar to impress a first date, gents.  The food is great! The sushi has always been fresh. The appetizers are great, and the venue and service just tie everything together! 8/10"}
{"text":"For being a chain restaurant its actually pretty good and for as busy as this place gets its impressive to see how these sushi chef's can crank out as many rolls as they do in such little time. Overall I wanted to dislike this place but was pretty impressed. Rolls were spot on, prices were fair, service was good, and specialty drinks were decently priced. Overall pretty solid place."}
{"text":"One day in the not-so-distant past, I had a craving for sushi for lunch. (Which, granted, is not unlike most days.) No one at work wanted to join, so I hit RA solo, no problem. I'd been there before a dozen times, and the food was always good, if not a little expensive. And I had hoped the service wouldn't be as slow as it had been in the past for me, but I was oh so wrong.  Case in point:  On this particular visit, I ended up waiting *forever* for my food. I did ask, once, and someone told me it would be \"right out.\" Finally, a server came by, noticed me twiddling my thumbs ...  Server: \"Oh my gosh, you look like such a lonely girl, with no food and just waiting to eat all by yourself! I'll go check on your food!\"  Anyway, I paraphrased, but that was the gist. Who says that?! Now, I've never been a server before, but aren't you NOT supposed to call attention to the fact that some patrons may be dining alone? She did apologize later, but between that and the wait, it kind of ruined the whole experience for me. I'll try RA again, I might just wait a while."}
{"text":"Service can be a hit or an inexcusable miss. Mom and I went several times, with okay service most of the time, and we are NOT fussy customers. Be friendly and attentive-that's all we need. But our final visit featured mediocre, slow service-with our host paying much more attention to a table he felt would provide a bigger tip.  Will not be returning."}
{"text":"As far as sushi franchises go, I would say this was slightly above average. The rolls I had were good, but nothing truly memorable.  In fact I don't really remember the names of the rolls we had!  I have had worse, but I have also had much better.  Sushi-wise,  This is more like a bar that serves sushi and not necessarily a sushi restaurant in the strictest sense.  We had lunch there, but you could tell at night this place turns into some swank club at nighttime.  I have been told this was the place to be during happy hour due to their drink specials and super cheap rolls.  I would venture to come back during a happy hour and give it another try."}
{"text":"The Fish Bowl drink is a must try.  It's a fun place and really affordable sushi during their late night specials.  We had so much food leftover, so the portions are pretty good.  This is definitely a good place to chill at if you're on the strip and craving sushi."}
{"text":"The fish was super fresh, which surprised me as it's in the middle of a desert. The staff was attentive without being too attentive. The patio was lovely and had heaters to keep the night chill away."}
{"text":"Kristine at the Sushi bar gave my daughter and I amazing service this Saturday night. Between her service and knowledge and kind suggestions she still couldn't be overshadowed by her very generous Manager Chris. They both went way over board to correct a small mistake in service that occurred in the beginning of our visit. I am leaving here amazed at this staffs commitment to service. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch. Food was average along with the service. Spotted a roach running around in the dining area. Needless to say we will not be returning"}
{"text":"The best! Its hard to find a good sushi place and RA Sushi Bar doesnt disappoint."}
{"text":"I am addicted to the miso hot soup with shrimp!!! So glad I gave this place another try."}
{"text":"Uhhhhhhh so Happy Hour is from 4-7 p.m., Monday - Friday (yeah - no weekend Happy Hour, like wtf?) I went with my best friend and we ordered two margaritas ($6), four sangrias ($7), and four plates of sushi (varied). Honestly, now that I'm typing it out I'm not surprised that our bill came out to $83 LOL. But I feel like you'll get more bang for your buck going to Happy Hour at Kona Grill.  The sushi here wasn't that great. I only took one photo because it was nothing too spectacular for me. The rice was hard on some dishes and on the crunchy tuna dish, the rice was actually so hard I hurt my tooth biting into it. The dishes that are supposed to be spicy, aren't. The drinks were okay - a little too strong for me. Again, you'll get better quality at Kona Grill.  My BIGGEST pet peeve was the waitress. She was attentive but right off the bat said that she had no idea what was on the menu and \"didn't know much.\" Now, if you're new or the restaurant just changed the menu I get it, but fake it til you make it honey. Or at the very least apologize and explain - don't just make yourself seem clueless. Again, she was attentive and checked on us a few times but the second thing I disliked is she brought the bill out before we asked for it and that made us feel rushed. It's a personal pet-peeve, I know, but I feel like I'm being asked to hurry up and there were PLENTY of open tables. Finally, what set me off was that she circled the tip area for us as, what?, a reminder to tip her? Don't do that. Please don't do that LOL. I will tip what I feel is appropriate but for her to circle the 20% tip area is like her telling me what I need to tip and that's just bad service.  I think it's safe to say I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Had lunch today, 5/11. Used a gift card given to me by the restaurant for a bad service experience. Sad to say things have not gotten better. Appetizer and one entree came out, but we waited for the second entree. While the food was good the service was bad. We won't be going back here."}
{"text":"I happen to LOVE me some sushi - Ra is a chain restaurant and so you're going to expect somewhat average food - but I have no complaints.  I live across the street from this location so we go there a lot and the service is great, I love the way they decorated it and the bar is indoor and outdoor, so it's a fun place to chill. On the weekends they have a DJ and at other times they still play fun music. You can totally go with friends on a weekend night and bar it up OR take the kids (I have 3 and they love sushi) earlier on and enjoy lunch or an early dinner."}
{"text":"Crystal was such a great server! Had a blast during happy hour. She made my time and my guests time great!"}
{"text":"Sushi is OK. Kabuki is better, they just are. Go try it. I'm trying to keep this short but I'm not writing out a long enough review, maybe if I just say a bunch of nonsense it'll post."}
{"text":"Stopped in for Happy Hour and had GREAT service and yummy sushi appetizes ...we had several appetizers for all of us to share...they were all great but the  Tootsy Maki - gets a special mention here  two thumbs up...yum - great happy hour selection that will leave your pocket book with gambling money & the drinks were good too...yep I will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Dorian our waiter was the worst! He forgot to put my husband's order in, kept forgetting to bring us things we asked for that are essential for eating sushi, gave us somebody elses bill that was already paid,  didn't offer to discount our meal when he screwed up our service. How is he still working? At least the food was decent."}
{"text":"I was here with my son last Sunday night as we were preparing to tour the ASU campus the following day. The service was excellent with frequent checks to make sure that everything was ok and water refills were done regularly. The sushi was decent although the rice seemed a little hard at times but still tasty.   I wish they offered AYCE on the sushi but that was not an option. The menu had a wide selection of mixed drink offerings which looked good but I didn't have a chance to try them because I stuck to my beer. We have one of these places near us in Corona, CA and will have to try it out and see how it compares to the Tempe, AZ location."}
{"text":"True, this place is often crowded, a bit loud, and getting your sushi takes a little while.  Anyway, the sushi is very good and the price is reasonable.  This is the place to go for a few rolls and bombers.  Their happy hour is also very good."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend of ours who lives in Vegas so we tried it out.  The restaurant is clean and eclectic, like their bathrooms, but the restaurant is really dark.  The Sushi was decent, between 4 of us we ordered almost 250 dollars worth, and it was average.  The presentation was good, but like someone else stated, it took a while and we were not told as to why or told when it would be out.  When we got the sushi, some of it seemed soft not firm as you would expect from sushi grade fish.  After the fact, I don't know if it was the sushi or the drinks while playing craps at the Wynn but I started to feel not so well.  I can't fault RA, as I drank a fair share, but I never had a reaction like that on any other night.  But this year when we go back to Vegas, we are going to skip RA and try Kabuki's or Sushi Roku."}
{"text":"I can't really comment on the food here because I didn't eat here, but the drinks weren't the greatest. I have to say, our bartender was nice enough but the place was so sadly empty for a thursday nite. I actually enjoyed the music there (both variety and volume.)"}
{"text":"Food remains tasty, service was far from satisfactory. Then we had to argue that the most expensive third of my husband's order never showed up. I was done with my meal before he received his first plate.   May come again, but forget weekends."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this RA cause it's close to home! The waiters/waitresses are always so nice! Our most recent visit we had Rebecca! She was wonderful! The atmosphere is always enjoyable with dim lighting for a slightly romantic, more intimate feel. We typically just get sushi and it's never failed us! We tried the spring rolls this last time and they are just perfect!"}
{"text":"For the most part, RA is not my scene. It was so loud I couldn't hear my dinner companions, everything was way over priced (more than $3 for a small bowl of miso? Seriously?), and the college kids banging the tables with their sake bombs were incredibly annoying.  That said, the food WAS good.  My dinner mates loved the variety of fish sushi they got, and I myself was really impressed with the yellow monkey roll. Why? Not many sushi places have fun or fancy rolls that are vegetarian; I usually get stuck with cucumber or avocado rolls, or veggie if I'm lucky.  However, this roll with the mango on top and wasabi sauce was absolutely to die for.  I wish they'd have more vegetarian rolls, because that might tempt me to come back and brave the ridiculous atmosphere.  Otherwise, I'm not 100% sure it is worth it.  But god, that yellow monkey roll was good. It just might be worth it."}
{"text":"A hidden gem on the strip, this is a great value for the quality of the food.    I love the sushi here, it's very fresh and not over priced.  Don't stay away from the rest of the menu though, there is tons of great food here for everybody.  If your not a Sushi fan, there is a full hot menu that you will find plenty to enjoy."}
{"text":"Not Bad sushi...very cool decor, a little too air conditioned...Definately a young good looking college crowd...and then us late 20 and 30 somethings..  A group of 12 of us went in tonight, a Tuesday, (we are all out of towners just here for work) and we got a table and served relatively quickly.   We ordered the Tuna Tar Tar, Spicy Tuna Roll, Rainbow Roll and some Nigiri...all I like is the Maguro combo's and they were great, nothing special, but tasty. At the other end of the table they got these deep fried rolls with cream cheese and all that I don't consider real sushi, they were probably good but I didn't try them.  The prices are ok, the 3 of us with all our sushi and $3.25 Miso soups and a few beers was only $77, maybe I'm just used to paying more in the San Fran area that I live...   The best part was the T-shirts all the waitresses wear..they say  \"Will you still _____ me in the morning.\" ....I guess you fill in the blank."}
{"text":"My first visit was good... I had the Hot Miso Soup which was delicious and filling. I also had the Ra'ckin Roll. The shrimp that topped it was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The customer service was okay, nothing wowed me about it. The atmosphere was nice too. Overall a good first impression, I'll be back again."}
{"text":"I pretty much only come here as they are one of the few places in the valley with a Saturday daytime happy hour. I usually sit in the outside bar and Brandon is always our bartender and he is awesome, great service and a lot of fun to talk to, definitely treats you well if you do likewise. Food is \"O.K\" you get what you pay for, but it's a great place to go for a few early drinks and a late cheap lunch. You can leave glassy eyed and full for a few bucks."}
{"text":"Friendly, efficient and great service from Tay.  A group of seven ordered several different tools, edamame and salads.  All were great and everything came out very quickly. The Viva Las Vegas roll was amazing!  Also thoroughly enjoyed the signature bourbon and strawberry cocktail The Samurai Smash.  We were dining before a concert and all seven of us were well fed and had a great time in about an hour.  Would definitely recommend and return if we're back in Vegas."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a 4 star review because I do go here really often, but after a first time at the happy hour last week, I have to say, my opinion has taken a real dive down into the almost a three/more like a 2.5 arena.  The good: -The decor is nice, it's hip, the place (excepting the women's room) is always very clean. -The fish is fresh. -The location is great because it is on the Strip but being on the outskirts of Fashion Show Mall it is not that difficult to navigate to get there without setting foot (or car) on the Strip. -They have a nice foursquare check-in that gives you either an order of edamame or a miso soup.  Pretty cool. -The Ra'chin Shrimp (appetizer shrimp) that is available during the happy hour is really good.  The sauce doesn't really complement the dish, but the shrimp are nice without it. -The Viva Las Vegas Roll and the seared tuna are really good.  They are more of a fusion but it totally works.  I order them each time I am there.  The consistent: -The servers have bigger attitudes than any other restaurant I have ever been to, consistently.  Once you understand that they aren't being personally rude, that they're just being kind of vapid because they don't care.... Last week my boyfriend sent back chicken wings because they tasted \"off\" (he did have indigestion later), our server said, \"Well, I always liked them,\" and walked away.  She took them off the check and the table, but she was kind of a dismissive jerk about it.  We have come to just expect that from the service, like you're inconveniencing them by being there. -The music is so so loud.  The bar portion of RA is fun, yes, but when you are over in the table portion, you don't want to hear the pounding music over your conversation.  This consistency is why I avoid being there after 9pm.  The bad:  -My luck must be placing me in the women's room when there is either a line or no toilet paper.  It's always one or the other, especially when one of the two stalls was out of commission. -They pride themselves on a great sake list but they often have 86'ed whichever I am ordering.  Boo.  I guess I should have placed that in consistencies as well. -Happy hour for drinks is good.  But I was shocked to see how skinny the rolls because during happy hour.  It was almost comical.  I won't be going to dine there again under the guise of a deal.  All and all, if you don't mind dismissive service but need to get something without the drama of heading into the heart of the Strip, it's good, but don't go in with high high hopes."}
{"text":"I remember when this place had excellent sushi. 2nd time in a row that we've been really disappointed. I'm leaving half of both smelly rolls I ordered and my wife is about to leave half of her chicken bowl. The chicken was almost decent.  Rice isn't cooked.  tiny rainbow roll that they chose to dress with salad to make it fill a small plate.  Lol.  Reminds me of gas station sushi.   Dammit. Should have tried across the walkway this time."}
{"text":"For those who understand some Japanese, \"RA\" is also spelled in hiragana to sound like \"raw,\" which is a somewhat clever name for a sushi restaurant. Too bad this place is more like \"ME,\" as in \"meh.\" (sorry, apparently the hiragana can't show up on yelp).  The decor is nice and fancy, but there's an obsession with the color red once you step inside that is really overbearing. The lights are so red it puts such a strain on your eyes that it was painful just to read the menu. Seriously, I felt like I was trapped inside a Nintendo Virtual Boy machine or something. And when the food came out, it didn't even look that appetizing because you can't even tell what you're eating unless you take a picture with flash - then you can appreciate the colors and effort they put into the food's presentation.  I ordered the Viva Las Vegas Roll and Crazy Monkey Roll. The VLV was primarily a crab & cream cheese concoction, with a nice fried lotus root which added a nice crunch. This was good, but after a few pieces, you kind of lose track of the flavor of the seafood which gets overtaken by the other ingredients (a common trait in Americanized sushi). The Crazy Monkey Roll was sweet with the teriyaki sauce glaze and cashews - the sweet and shiny look made it seem like fish baklava. Kinda good, but strangely gross too if you think about it. As for my friends, most had worse luck. Two ordered the same Lobster Shrimp Roll, but one got the short stick as his lobster tasted off ~ it seemed old. Yuck.  As for the service, it was a mixed bag. Attentive waiters readily refreshing my glass, but the chefs were slow: my CMR came almost 20 minutes after I received my VLV.  Overall, if you like Americanized sushi and a flashy modern settings, then RA might be the place for you. But if you like your eyeballs and actually want to taste your seafood in your sushi, you probably have much better options elsewhere in Vegas for your sushi fix."}
{"text":"very good sushi over at Ra on Mill. The food is why i went and that is what i am basically rating right now. Sat at the bar, it was a nice evening all in all. But the service was a strong C-. I really hope they improve over time because they would pull better ratings in no time. I will not give up just yet. i will go back there in a while to give them another chance.  Have fun be safe and good luck."}
{"text":"By far our favorite sushi place to date. We always like to try new places for sushi, but always come back to RA! Always super friendly staff as well! We love Happy Hour!  So happy this one opened up just down the road from us a few years back! Customers for life!"}
{"text":"The server was friendly and attentive. My husband and I went because I got a $20 certificate off my meal for my half birthday. I had the best lunch. Of course, I ordered more food than i needed. The food was so fresh that we finished it all."}
{"text":"Prior to heading Marquee for the night, our party of 10 ppl had made reservations at RA sushi for dinner. Last minute there were more people added to our party and the hostess was accommodating. Though it took some convincing and i believe it was due to them not being busy that night. We started our dinner with a round of drinks and some peppers. Their peppers were undercooked and the worst of all places i had ordered the same type of peppers.   We also ordered ceviche as an appetizer which was served with unrippened avocados, one type of fish, and maybe a few shrimp. Though it was the best of all items ordered, it was definitely not considered \"good.\" Once our drinks came out, we were all enjoying our time and placed our entree orders with the server. Our roll took the longest to arrive and it was not even the correct order. We continued to just eat the unsatisfactory appetizers to suppress our hunger and continued asking the server when our roll would be out. As everyones food finished they brought out our roll and another appetizer that they had forgotten to originally deliver.  We felts as though for a place like Las Vegas, we would have had more attentive servers and much better customer service. We had to wait around 20 minutes for them to bring out our bill, which we asked numerous times for. The bill had a lot of incorrect orders on it and we had to have them adjust again which required another 15 minutes of our time.  Overall the dinner experience was mediocre at best. I understand that we were a large party and it is more difficult to accommodate everyones needs, but the lack of attentiveness we received was not acceptable. However, they did have good fried rolls, which is what a few of the other members in our party had ordered. But if you like real sushi and quality fish RA is definitely not a place to consider."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, order the Viva Las Vegas Rolls. Sunday nights they have a dj, great entertainment."}
{"text":"They send out great coupons when you join their email club.  $20 on your half birthday and the occasional $10 off $20.  I like being able to sit outside on the patio at this location.  Happy hour specials aren't that great of a deal.  Lychee martini was just okay, though it was strong.  Pineapple wontons I didn't care for.  Avocado roll is okay... just what you would expect.  I really like the vegetable tempura."}
{"text":"I have eaten here countless times over the years and somehow this is my first review.  So many reviews and so little time I guess.  Anyway, I can't understand why this particular location has more than a few crappy reviews.  Ra as a chain provides some of the better sushi around and this location is no different.  At some other sushi places you never really know what you are going to get.  This sometimes can be a good thing, but if you want consistently good/fresh tasting sushi at a reasonable price, then Ra is your place.  I honestly have no complaints about Ra's Mill location.  I always get great service and great sushi.  I do agree with a lot of the reviews on here that the music is too loud though.  I really hate having to yell to my table-mates and struggle to hear what they are saying.  I dunno...maybe I'm just getting old.  The decor/bathrooms have pretty much remained unchanged for years and years and could use an update as well.  That's pretty much it for my complaints.  I went here last night at about 8:30ish with a party of 6.  It took a while to get seated but it wasn't too bad.  The place does tend to get crowded so be prepared.  Our waitress was excellent and was quick to refill my diet coke.  We ordered several rolls and some other stuff that I can't remember but it was all fresh and excellent as always.  We spoke to the new general manager (Blake) and he is awesome.  It was nice that he came to our table to make sure everything was ok and offered some excellent recommendations.  He also talked about how he is trying to turn the place around and has replaced some staff and is expecting a total remodel this summer which should be interesting.  Anyway, with or without the changes I will continue to dine here often."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food although the wait was a bit long for just what i ordered, but i was satisfied."}
{"text":"A great sushi joint located on the first floor of the Fashion Mall in Las Vegas.  Especially great during happy hour M-Sat 3-7.  Ambience- A great place to hang out.  Has a dining room area with a sushi bar.  It also has a seperate partitioned bar area where you can just drink and share a couple appetizers.    Food- Everything was very tasty, especially the lobster spring rolls.  The presentation of the food also felt chic.  We got 3 different sushi rolls, lobster spring rolls, vegetable tempura (yum), and beer for under $30 including tip during happy hour!    Service- It wasn't very busy when we went, but the service was still kind of slow.  But when we did manage to track down our server, she was helpful, friendly, and professional."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location several times before, and have never had an issue. However, yesterday a friend and I stopped in to eat and the service we received was terrible. My friend literally had to get out of his seat several times to find our server. Also, there seems to be some sort of bug problem. There were these little flies flying around us the entire time we were eating, one even fell into our drink! It was so gross. I don't think I'll be back here."}
{"text":"Very basic and overpriced .....$60 on happy hour for 2 and what is pictured all we ordered nothing was flavorful very bland . The Ambiance was good and our server was nice but never again even on happy hour more like dissatisfied for some real sushi go somewhere else ...We left our left over on the table for literally 1minute came back the server said they threw it away ...In 1 minute seriously:/"}
{"text":"This place has really good sushi and teriyaki chicken I highly recommend it to sushi and teriyaki chicken likers"}
{"text":"Great sushi! Good friendly staff. Quality that can be counted on. Take out quality & taste just as good!"}
{"text":"Service-  Above and beyond.  My glass of water was always filled, my sake always poured, and the food came out within a few minutes of each order.  It was during HH on Sunday, so they were busy, but not packed.  Overall, outstanding service.   App-  The shishito peppers were spicy and delish.  Came with a wonderful chili garlic sauce.   Fish-  I had salmon and yellowtail negiri.  Wonderfully fresh.    Chili ponzu roll:  Spicy and Fresh yellowtail.  So tasty!!!  For the happy hour prices, you can't beat it.  So much better than RA San Diego.    Really excellent food and service for a great price.  Thanks for the great experience!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour Mon-Sat 3-7pm & 10pm-Close, Sun 3pm to Close  Came in for late night Happy Hour with Ambi D.  They have tons of Happy Hour food and drink specials.  Everything is under $10 with most being in the $5-$8 range.  We sat at the bar and started with a Fuzzy Momo Bellini and Milk & Cookies Cocktail.  For food we ordered Lobster Spring Rolls, Pineapple Cheese Wontons, Scallop Dynamite Roll, Kaarage Chicken and Shrimp Lettuce Wraps.  Food was excellent.  The Lobster Spring Rolls and Pineapple Cheese Wontons tasted almost identical.  Both have cream cheese and fruit (mango and pineapple) so while they were good I wouldn't order them together again.  We had a great bartender who made sure we were taken care of.  Drinks were super strong, to strong for me to be honest.  I'm not a quitter so I finished them, but it was a struggle."}
{"text":"\"Don't worry, it's only across the street.\" I think I've said that same line to about fifteen different people as we're walking \"one block\" across Las Vegas Blvd from the Palazzo to Fashion Show Mall. It does look close, what they don't realize is that with all the causeways and walkways and the fact it's 115 degrees outside and that we need to keep stopping to light cigarettes, finish our mojitos, and check our cell phones that are blowing up, that it will take 15 minutes to walk there.  RA Sushi is on the Wynn side corner of Fashion Show Mall, totally Vegas style, you've pretty much got a lot of what you want in there, and also a lot of what you don't. On the darker side in regards to lighting (note: beneficial information, darker means cooler temperature, bonus) the restaurant has a large sushi bar and wonderful glowing red orb light fixtures throughout giving it a modern yet Asian feel. There's always ample seating, my servers are gracious and usually totally hot (note for men: hot sexy waitresses serving sushi, not bad) and their outside area is where you'll find me and my crew.  Veggie gyoza potstickers with spicy sauce, super tasty miso soup (yes, sometimes there IS a difference), and beef skewers that just hit the spot. There's even a happy hour where drinks and sushi/appetizers are extremely inexpensive so we stock up before we hit the tables once again. The sake list is good, so you can get your drink on, and the mixed drinks aren't half bad at all. My sushi comes quickly and is always fresh. The fish is good and light, and the rolls creative and most on the larger side. You don't have to drop dollars and make it rain to eat like a rockstar here which is good, especially if you hit up Sushi Roku the night before and your 400 dollar bill isn't exactly what you were looking for to spend for lunch with your roll dawgs.   My waitress hooked me and my girl up last time like superstars, and she's always taken care of me there. We tip well, they take care of us. Plus afterwards if you've gotten your buzz on as appropriate in Vegas, you can go shopping galore inside, walk back across the street (for the high rollers) and hit the Wynn, or do as we do: Plan ahead, wear our bikinis to go to the pool, desperately try to make it everyday, and instead end up sitting at the tables, playing like it's going out of style."}
{"text":"This place has awesome happy hour sushi specials. I love eating outside the they have  a fun cool decor going on. The service was awesome my drinks were never empty and they had great suggestions on what to order. The sushi was fresh. The only negatives I have were one it was very salty for sushi and the California roll was loaded with mayonnaise. A true California roll should not have any mayo. Other that that the food was great."}
{"text":"Ended up coming here with my brother and my mom before his graduation for a quick dinner. Wasn't too bad and the food came out pretty fast and they have different options on the menu for everyone. Ended up getting several different rolls and a chicken dinner plate as well. We didn't have anything left on our plates! Would suggest trying out this place."}
{"text":"Always love coming here!  This time Patrick was our server. Very personable and friendly. The food was amazing. Thanks and will be back again."}
{"text":"For starters, I have enjoyed Ra Sushi in the past, so there was a certain expectancy of quality, and the AZ location represented ok. Our server Jesse, as funny, helpful and on her game. I deducted a star for one simple fact, they served everything at once, 3 cut rolls, edamame appetizers and 4 orders of nigiri . I normally deplore slow service, this was hyper service....some where in between is that other star. The prices were a little higher than I'm used too for such conservative servings...but this is Az, right. I probably will try the other local options before spending $150 to feed 3 people with limited adult beverages ."}
{"text":"Fab happy hour.... make dinner out of it! 4 rolls , 2 salads & a lobster wonton app with a divine sauce to go with... all about $40... including a couple drinks..  Yellow tail roll was my least fav.. just had a weird taste.. and I cant do sushi with a taste that isnt fresh... umm sorry not worth it.. but everything else was right on...so I didnt send back...  Waiter kind of complacent.. I hate my salads to come seconds before my other choices..  Decor I adore!"}
{"text":"Despite having an amazing time with great people, the food here especially the sushi rolls were passable and small.  My friend ordered a steak and rice dish and there were barely any steak in there.  Right William?  The drinks are cheap and I hear the happy hour is pretty decent.  Unfortunately I missed the happy hour.  The staff was very accommodating, but it did seem like that would change from day to day depending on mood.  Would not come here again.  Also parking is horrendous, so if you are planning to come here, you might consider taking a cab."}
{"text":"I was really bummed out about the 2 steak dishes we ordered from the entree section of the dinner menu. I was feeling fancy fresh so the thought of a $18 steak sounded like a great idea at the time. The more cash money the item on the menu is, means the food is better, amirite? Well I was wrong!    $18 for peppered steak and it was salt bombed with salt bombs beyond repair. I was seriously dehydrated like a mofo after the first bite. RATED: 2/5   $18 for crazy tough Teriyaki beef. I wasn't about to let my digestive system work overtime. The meat was insanley gristly. My teeth couldn't process it and had to spit it out. RATED: 2/5   I was not expecting this much of a mouth work out for dinner. It was an unfortunate execution of simple dishes.   The service is also questionable. Tell me, when is it appropriate to pull up a chair, snag the leg on my pants and plop down to take my order? That was mortifying! I will never ever understand that approach.  The common denominator here is that they are basic and overpriced. Don't fall victim to their loveless food!"}
{"text":"Sushi? Where? Ra? NO! Ok this is not the place to get sushi. Ra has had a few problems in the past and has earned a bad rap. I never thought I would ever step foot inside until Khamis H. told me about the happy hour. Now I can't stay away! I don't know about you, but $5 sakebombs make me really happy. As in, one of those 22oz kirins and a carafe of sake. Cheap wells too. And discounted apps like pineapple cheese wontons. Sound gross, taste good.   Yeah, there's the cheapo rolls too, but from what I've seen...pretty sad. Who doesn't put cream cheese in a veggie roll or even offer just a regular avocado roll? I'd recommend sticking to alchie here.  Oh and do not go to the Old Town Scottsdale location because they don't \"do\" happy hour.   P.S. the children working there need help doing their job so make sure you bully them just enough so they don't forget to put in your appetizer and you get it 40 minutes later.   P.P.S. sit at the sushi bar because that's where the cool kids sit and you can snag an extra roll or two from the guy behind the counter and your server probably won't notice. Everybody's happy."}
{"text":"this is a fun laid back place. I come here regularly. my favorite waitress is Jayme. she is so nice and always on top of it. highly recommend."}
{"text":"So yummy and great service! They have a great happy hour as well that really can't be beat for a shush I place, especially on the strip. It's located in fashion show so you can grab some drinks, sushi, and get some shopping in... Not much better than that!"}
{"text":"Oh I get here then they say hey round eyes we close at 1 so you go now"}
{"text":"The food is very good and they have a good selection of rolls and sashimi however the service was really bad. They kept coming to our table with food for other tables and we ran out of water a few times. Once you get the waiters attention they do bring what you need, but the service is slow. Also the music is extremely loud making it hard to converse."}
{"text":"Super dissapointed. I've never been to Ra before this and being A Hostess at a Japanese Restaraunt, I know a lil something about quality Japanese food. The sushi was luke warm and old tasting like it's been sitting out. The appetizer was alright but the server was slow and overall the food quality was a real let down."}
{"text":"RA is a mini-chain sushi restaurant with a few different locations around Phoenix. It has a unique blend of sushi-fusion dishes and everything I've tried tastes great.  For an appetizer, I recommend the Shishito peppers. They are fresh and grilled whole. On the side, is a very spicy red sauce and in the center of the bowl is a savory sauce with chopped garlic. The peppers can be quite spicy themselves, but this is my favorite dish at RA.  The sashimi is very fresh and has the melt-in-your-mouth texture that sound sushi should. The Tunacado (ahi Tuna appetizer), miso soup, and Sencha tea are all good sides.  The service is acceptable, but not exceptional. The food prices are a little high, but the food quality and portion sizes are also very good.  RA is one of the best sushi restaurants that I have found in the Phoenix area and it worth visiting for anyone who likes sushi."}
{"text":"Sucky, sucky service lunch service!!  No ice in iced tea, no wasabi, check took forever... waitress was never around.  Crappy.  Food was decent but nothing great... Mediocre sushi.  Glasses looked spotty/dirty.  Not everyone is in Vegas to hang out all day and do shots on a Monday!"}
{"text":"Fantastic dining experience! Food is delicious, service is friendly/fast/accurate (ask for Christie!). Big variety, so if sushi's not your thing, there's options."}
{"text":"Like the food, and ambiance - prices are not too bad either, the Tempura Veggies are a great app"}
{"text":"We have been to RA sushi almost every time we visit Vegas. The sushi is different than your average place. We love the variety of Rolls they make. They also have an awesome drink selection! Recently we had a birthday party there and needed a reservation for 27. They accommodated us without charging ridiculous minimums and service charges as do most other Vegas Restaurants. He management team was amazing. We wanted a DJ present at our dinner and they very easily made this happen. They made us feel so welcome. Our servers were amazing and on top of things and management was right there with them making sure everyone was happy. Definitely recommend, not only is the food and drink awesome but so is the service they provide."}
{"text":"Got the sashimi salad. Barely any sashimi all salad. Compared to old town, the give next to nothing. I was also hungry too and was looking forward to a nice dinner. How disappointing."}
{"text":"I LOVE HAPPY HOUR! lol but who doesn't. =)  I love this place because it has happy hour on a weekend. Its located at the mall so you can shop while you wait for happy hour or walk it off after. They have a nice patio area so you can see the action on the strip. Great place for yummy cocktails and cheap rolls! The rolls are a little on the small side but I loved it because it wasn't all rice which is what you get from most big rolls anyway. I was able to try so much more on their happy hour menu and even some off their regular menu. They send me emails occasionally that make me long for this place and a return to vegas. :)"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised at their happy hour and service.Bethanie was great and on top of her game. The only reason not five stars is because the happy hour menu could have been more discounted for \"Happy hour\" but I have no complaints and enjoyed the experience and food overall. Try the seared tuna- it's beyond amazing!!"}
{"text":"Place was great food was also very good the waitress staff was very nice and greet you with a smile and checked up on just enough to make sure al was good"}
{"text":"Went here for drinks last night and was definitely the oldest in the place - lots of college kids hanging out doing sake bombs!  The music was clubby and the atmosphere was cool.  Maybe I'll try again after school has let out."}
{"text":"I have been to RA a few times and 2-3 have been at this location. My most recent meal here was incredible.  The shishito peppers are a must-have. The ponzu sauce had us tipping the empty bowl over to lick, drink, and pour on our remaining rice. It was that good.  We tried the Pacific Roll, which is essentially the experience of eating fresh mango salsa. It's not what I would call sushi, but it was tasty and refreshing. The sashimi is solid as well. The lunch combo is ~$10 and they will mix and match any 7 pieces of tuna/salmon/yellowtail you want.  This location, located in downtown Tempe on Mill Ave, is a bit more of a club/bar style than the others I've seen. They play lots of upbeat club/remix/techno music at all times of day. The service was friendly and decent."}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars because of the service. Food was your standard sushi restaurant joint. My sister and 2 cousins came in around 3PM on a Saturday. It was dead there. On their website it said that happy hour started at 3PM but when we got there, they told us happy hour didn't start until 4PM. We were hungry and I didn't care, I was willing to overlook. I guess everything on the menu was an additional $3 since we were straddling lunch / happy hour/ dinner.   The waitress was like half helping us half flirting with some other customers and dicking around in the back. This totally pissed me off. Just because they worked at the hotels and you were trying to get into some club for tonight or whatever it is - you still have other customers you should attend to! Additionally, It looked like most of the wait staff was on lunch break and they were eating pizza in front or hiding in the back. We got an appetizer and no utensils. We had to ask the busboy to get us some. All the tables around us had cloth napkins but we ended up getting bar napkins and some forks. Wait, he threw in chopsticks for good measure too...  The icing on the top was when we got the bill. She wrote a big \"THANK YOU! =)\" on the receipt AND circled the \"suggested tip\" section. WHAT THE FUCK? Just because i look young doesn't' mean I'm going to tip you $2. I was APPALLED. How fucking rude of you. Since I didn't want to be a bitch, I tipped my usual 18% and left.  Never again. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Had an awesome lunch with my son's today...love the seasonal menu and the shrimp.mango tempura roll.  Everything was so fresh!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went on Friday night for a girls night out so we decided to start our night here. The place was on a short wait and it was packed! Almost to a point where it was not enjoyable, so keep that in mind if you want a place for conversation. We had sake bombers, which were great as always and a, what we thought was complimentary (four square check in) edamame appetizer and then ordered the calamari. The calamari was amazing! Then we had sushi with these fried shrimps on top and they were amazing! There was some confusion on our other sushi order and it came out wrong. When we asked the snobby server to fix it, we got the \"eye roll\" but she took it back to fix it. The check came and it was about $85 for both of us, the server still charged us for the edamame and the service pretty much stunk as we saw her about 3 times. I hate tipping less than 20% so I didn't, but the server didn't deserve the $18 tip I felt compelled to leave. I would come back, but maybe at a different time because it was so loud and crowded. I personally enjoy more of a quiet dining experience."}
{"text":"The sushi was great and the edamame was also amazing however our waitress \"Timmer\" customer service was piss poor. Gave me a dirty cup and gave attitude when I asked for a to go cup.Seemed extremely uninterested in our table, took long time to check on our table but was frequently visiting the other tables around us. And to out the cherry on top, there was hair in my chicken and salad . Our waitress said \"wow im that sucks\" the manager then came over and did damage control and seemed sincere"}
{"text":"Wow,what a fun place for great deals on Happy Hour food and drinks The bartender Andrew is top notch, never missing a beat in seeing our drinks refilled and questions answered. We are newbies with sushi and it showed. He was patient and helpful yet still tending to a slammed restaurant and full bar. The Tempura Shrimp was tender and delicious. Our California Roll was great and the edamame was tasty. We love the music pounding, hearing a lot of our recent and older faves. The patrons all looked happy and relaxed. Could have been all the Sake bombers goin' around! All in all, we'll be back! Our tab was so cheap we can go twice a week!"}
{"text":"Sushi is so good here! So much better then some of the other locations. Seems like everything is more fresh and also the Vegas roll is so perfect! The chip on top of the Vegas roll is so perfectly deep fried and crispy. Makes the ra at Dana park in Mesa a one star.. I will never eat at the Dana park one again. Their are amazing at this location!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a bad meal or service here over all the years I've visited. I went today and tried some items from their new menu. The new Red Seabream Carpaccio, Langostino Strawberry Salad, Tuna California Roll and Red Seabream Nigiri were all delicious. We also tried to Peach Basil Sour and it was very tasty. Great service! Will definitely be back soon for HAPPY HOUR!"}
{"text":"Too full to take pictures. Every time I'm in Las Vegas,NV I have to have my fill @ RA Sushi. Every visit I have appreciated the wonderful customer service and satisfaction from the staff - especially the cooks. :)   They also have a great happy hour selection of beverages and food.  Another plus - they stay open until 1ish I believe - and is a great people watching spot. It is connected to the Fashion Show Mall - so do some shopping and then have a bite to eat!  Everyone that I have experienced this venue with has enjoyed it as much as myself if not more!"}
{"text":"Why is the service always so bad here? I come here pretty often and the service is never good. Slow, inattentive and very lax. The food is always good and the drinks are not bad but the service is bad enough to stop returning. Managers should stop focusing on hiring hungry women with too much make up and start hiring experienced servers. I won't be returning here again."}
{"text":"Amazing food and atmosphere , prices are decent .. Customer service is 5-star. Drinks are great. I'll be back here asap!"}
{"text":"We were there about nine on a Saturday night in early January.  It wasn't very busy. The service wasn't very good. The waiter took my water glass from the table to refill it and didn't come back for almost ten minutes as an example. Not sure he really knows how to wait a table. Their signature cocktail was so sweet it was hard to finish. The short rib appetizers were bland and very fatty. The vegetable roll was very bland as well.  Bad drinks, bad food, bad service.  We won't be going back soon."}
{"text":"It looks more upscale on the inside than the facade. I like the atmosphere and loved the sushi. The spicy lobster roll was so good, I had to order a second!"}
{"text":"Nothing like techno music pumping when you are trying to enjoy dinner, too loud to talk without yelling and place was not even close to being full. Grossly overpriced for what we received and service was mediocre at best. Nothing like white rice and a flattened piece of chicken for $16, no veggies, no sides, no nothing, the breading was the only thing I cared for. The sushi roll was falling apart and was not cut to an appropriate size, we had to cut the pieces smaller with a fork and knife. The lobster spring rolls were good but not good enough to go back. Better bang for your buck elsewhere, with better food, better service and better music that is not meant for 12 year old girls."}
{"text":"Favorite spot on a Sunday night. Get your orders in before midnight (it might have changed) to enjoy the happy hour prices. $1 sake! A couple more dollars and you can get the chilled flavored sakes (melon)  It use to be a hiphop crowd on sunday nites. There's still a DJ, but more like a video DJ. I miss having the actual DJ and  his music. The last time I was there it was mostly a lot of rap videos.   They've added more to their reverse happy hour list, which is so much better.  A great place to get a group of friends to chill and drink. Mix crowd on sundays, but more on the younger crowd. Not no family and kids place. Can't wait to round up some friends and hopefully go back."}
{"text":"Ok so this is a sushi bar right? the salads and the regular menu was bigger than their sushi menu.  There was regular basic rolls and sashimi but very few specialty rolls.  I had the spicy tuna and one of their must have rolls, the Tootsy Maki.  The spicy tuna really lacked any kick as I like spicy, and the tootsy maki was supposed to have sauce on it and it was skimpy at best.  The kids got crab and cream cheese and it all fell apart and was just average.  The other child got sashimi and it came with radish noodles which was a nice dish.  Then the other mother got the tuna salad and it was nice but didn't seem anything special as limited tuna in it and a basic salad with tuna on top.   The service was average as we had to ask for drink refills but she did check twice to see if we needed anything. I did have to ask for more ginger twice as well and we had to ask for chopstix helpers for the kids when most places offer if they have them.  The waitress was good answering questions though when she took our order but she hadn't tried and couldn't recommend the dishes we were asking about.   The place was convenient as we were in the mall for the new Disney store but it wouldn't be my first pick for sushi where i would crave going back. I try to do sushi once a week but with sushi in the title of the restaurant i felt let down by their selection and the experience, especially for the price. Gave two stars as convenient if at fashion show, good view if sit outside and the food wasn't bad just not anything to stand out"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the place. Staff were not very knowledgeable about the gluten friendly options. I placed my order and the waitress repeated it back to me and wrote it down. Then she brought me the wrong thing. My gluten friendly salad arrived topped with wonton strips. There was so much confusion by the staff. I had to return the salad and the meal. They didn't bring me the miso soup because they said it has soy (which they thought had gluten). Lots of educational moments. Sadly I still got \"glutened\" in spite of being super careful and making them aware of my issue. I know they are not gluten free and can't guarantee anything but I found a wonton strip in my salad after I returned the first one. It was small and I didn't realize until I was already chewing. The damage was already done at that point and I didn't want to return anything else. With all the confusion and hassle I would think they would comp part of my meal or at least not charge me for the soup. Nope! I paid full price for a meal that has now made me sick. So much room for improvement. On a positive note, the food was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I've ever been here when it was NOT Happy Hour. Still, RA has a great HH, and you should check it out.  Almost all of the appetizers are delicious and discounted. I think RA has some of the best Tempura dishes around. Their wings are tasty too.  Good drink specials...although their beer selection isn't stellar. There's always music playing in the background--different volumes depending on which day of the week it is and what area of the establishment you're located. It can be either dance-floor thumpin' or just background noise. Move to a different part of the restaurant accordingly.  Service is decent. Barely friendly (but enough), and frequently slow.  Overall, solid choice for an occasional Happy Hour. This isn't a regular stop though."}
{"text":"Eh. Is all I have to say. I have come to this location multiple times now for lunches, happy hour and dinners. I normally have a good experience eating just some good sushi in the Phoenix/Tempe area.  This time I felt like our server took forever to introduce herself to us and get our drinks. We were starving at this point!  Speaking of drinks, I'm not sure what it is but the water there is disgusting! You absolutely need a lemon or it is impossible to drink. Our rolls and miso soups came out next, which were pretty good. Just remember Vegas Roll. Order it.... Next she brings 2 of the 5 lunch meals and does not bring the remaining for another 5 minutes. RUDE. Bring everything out at once! I got the chicken teriyaki bento box and the chicken was dry, will not order that again. Not pleased"}
{"text":"I tried this place a couple months back. We got sat immediately but it literally took 25 minutes for a waiter to come and get our drink orders. They all saw us there but for some reason didn't think to come take our order or anything. The food is decent but it definitely can't make up for the horrible service. One of the people I was with ordered a green tea and we all tried it and thought it was disgusting. When we tried to tell our waitress about it, she refused to do anything about it and then my friend ended up getting charged for an extra drink on top of the tea that she hated and didn't even want to drink. They seriously need to work on their customer service!!"}
{"text":"I had great experience! The guy behind the bar ( I think his name is Ivan) was really nice , fast and friendly!food was great! Totally be back when I am in town :)"}
{"text":"Just leaving this place and management tonight needs to be fired.  Sushi has no color, no flavor and just not fresh.  The floors are dirty and all the soy sauce containers were empty. Now, this place wasn't busy today at 6:00 pm so everything should be ready to go.  I took my daughter to the restroom and it was disgusting.  Smelled horrible.  I can't believe this place is still open in Ahwatukee.   Seriously, the experience was disgusting and gross. I will never come back again.  Horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Always consistent, very good and affordable Sushi.  While not too exotic, it's something perfect for easy-going sushi-lovers.  Their happy hour rocks!"}
{"text":"Zach (manager) really made our experience at Ra amazing. He took great care of our table. Super nice guy, great food and atmosphere. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Heard about happy hour so we checked it out.  1.  Substantial wait for all HH customers (40-60minutes) 2.  Our wait was longer than quoted 3.  By the time we were FINALLY seated, they wouldn't honor HH prices even though we had checked in a full hour before HH was to end but got stuck waiting for a table for an hour. 4. It was too loud 5. Our server forgot two orders We won't be back."}
{"text":"A better Ra than in Torrance. Definitely a good stop for sushi in Las Vegas. That said, I have limited sushi experiences in Vegas. Its decent. We had a fatty salmon and it was pretty fulfilling. Its about average, thus the three stars."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed with the improvement of service and quality of food with this restaurant. I literally come here especially for the Zonie and Gojira roll. Oh my gosh it's a party in your mouth!! And the hostesses and waitresses are so friendly! Will be coming here regularly :)"}
{"text":"RA's sushi is definitely as good as most of the other places around here.  My only complaint is that while it's as good, it is also definitely more expensive. But the ambiance and service definitely make up for that. The servers have always been friendly and they are usually pretty quick to get food out."}
{"text":"The flavor was good but the price wasn't as advertised. I ordered the spicy tuna and rainbow roll but when the bill came they charged me dinner prices. When I ask d what happened to the lunch price they said \"sorry, we didn't know that's what you wanted.\" Five dollars more for the same meal."}
{"text":"Very good sushi at good prices. Sake was inexpensive at $3 - $3.50 for a 180ml pot.  Waitress was really on top of things. Fun atmosphere. Next time I'm in town, I'll be stopping in. READ ON!  EDIT: The waiter or waitress can make or break a place. We went back the next night. Food was still good, but service SUCKED. It took the waiter over 50 minutes to check back with us after taking the order, which was all sorts of screwed up. Ran out of drinks, out of water, out of everything. WTH?  We wanted to make another order of sushi, but he never came back around.   When I finally flagged him down and confronted him about it, he said, \"Well yeah, we're really busy.\" It was less busy than it was the night prior when we were there, and the waiter was selectively ignoring or tending to other tables (mostly ignoring them). I pointed out the screwed up orders, and he offered to fix it. We told him not to worry about it, and that we just wanted the check, as we had to go. He didn't listen to that either, and instead we were brought the correct order by the manager. We sent him away and again asked for the check, explaining to him the problems we experienced.   Management knew about the issues and did nothing. Were I this manager, dealing with customers with legitimate issues of this magnitude, the check would have been comp'd."}
{"text":"The last time I came here was when I had family from out-of-town visiting, before the Jets-Cardinals game in October 2016. Since I had finished up with an appointment in another part of Tempe, I decided to use a Half-birthday certificate I had from the Hook-Up email club. It was in the early afternoon, so the crowd was understandably light. I was able to get my order fairly quick, which was pretty tasty. Not too much to cause a food coma, but certainly enough to satisfy until later in the day. Getting the check was a little slow, but otherwise, I still have yet to be disappointed with RA Sushi!"}
{"text":"GREAT sushi place! Have passed here multiple times but never tried until my most recent trip to Scottsdale due to a recommendation of a client.  The waitress was super helpful in helping me pick something a little of the box but still comfortable with. Ended up with a caterpillar roll which I highly recommend if you like avocado! Tried a few other rolls as well with my table and some specialty cocktails.  Sat on the patio, which was loud at times since it is on a busy road, but a great place to do happy hour, and a seek out next time I am in town!"}
{"text":"Consistent, decent sushi.  I am never WOW'd here, but also never disappointed. Service is always good."}
{"text":"RA gets 3 stars because for the same prices, the sushi is much better than what you get in Philly. But Philly generally has terrible sushi unless you're paying top dollar, so this was a worthwhile visit. My party received immediate and friendly service, even though we oscillated between sitting outside, at a table, or at the bar (we opted for the bar because it was the quietest place inside).  My party would have loved to have had a table-like conversation, but the music was too loud. That's okay. We enjoyed our affordable drinks and cheap sushi. Unfortunately, the music was exactly what I might have heard at a club. Are all RA venues like this? My ears were pounding after I left."}
{"text":"This was my second time at RA. I decided to give it one more try after my first not so impressive lunch. I am surprised at how different my experience was now! My husband and I ordered 5 different rolls, all of which were fresh and delicious! The rolls came out in no time; we were sitting at the bar and every thin was prepared on the spot. The service was great the whole time we were there. I am so glad I decided to go again and try other types of rolls. Will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Last night I had such an amazing dinner with my husband at RA. We have been to this location once last year on Halloween and then never had the chance to return back all this time unfortunately.   We arrived at 7pm and the restaurant was pretty full. We had to wait for a few min for a table and were seated soon after that. Our hostess asked us if we had a special occasion and we didn't so she just thanked us for dining with them for the night, something I thought was nice. She also handed us the menus.   Our server came to our table shortly after that. She asked us for our drink orders and asked if we had any questions regarding the menu and I did actually and she explained the difference between two choices I had in mind and then gave us a few more minutes to look at the menu while she went to get our drinks. Our drinks were served and we then placed our order of 5 different sushi rolls. Yesterday I decided to break my dairy free diet and just enjoy the sushi with cream cheese since I know from a previous time that a couple of rolls we tried and loved had cream cheese in them. We basically ordered 4 of the signature rolls and the chili ponzu roll (which was our server's recommendation when my husband asked her to recommend our 5th roll).  Even though the restaurant was full, our sushi rolls came out very quickly. The scallop dynamite roll (which is a bomb!!) followed a little later because it's cooked. We dug in and... OmG!!! we were in sushi heaven! The Viva Las Vegas, the crazy monkey, the ponzu, rack in roll were all just absolutely delicious and then scallop dynamite, my oh my, it was to die for!   Our server checked on us a few times during our dinner and made sure we had refills. She was exceptionally good and attentive and was very sweet and had a smile on her face the whole time. I wish I remembered her name to mention her here! I will be sure to update this review with her name the next time we're there.   We enjoyed our food soooo much yesterday I was super glad we ended up going there, especially since we we had 3 other choices in mind for dinner last night! I also was glad I didn't check out the recent reviews of the restaurant (not sure what happened there) until we were already seated and ordering otherwise I would have missed out on such a great experience!   Thank you RA! You made our evening yesterday spectacular!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery near closing time. Miso soup was literally only broth, not a single piece of seaweed, tofu or onion. Tuna bowl tasted OK but did not receive any of the sauces mentioned on the menu and the rice was a portion for a 5 year old (seriously why skimp on white rice?). Grilled vegetables tasted like rubber. Smh feels like I got scammed."}
{"text":"Accept the prices this place have the best sushi  We got there on Saturday night for a late night food  The service was really good , very out going person  The food got there fast , big portion . We asked for a lot of spicy mayo and we got it :)   ( normally they are very cheap on the mayo)  Th sushi is always fresh and taste good  We finished the dinner full and happy  They do need to drop prices for late night menu"}
{"text":"Missed the lunch special by a few minutes... Which in Las Vegas means it is happy hour. Great waitress, well versed in the menu. So good -- had spicy shrimp, edamame and a few other things, everyone was happy and it's cheap. I don't mean cheap by comparison - I mean CHEAP"}
{"text":"RA sushi is just all hype with no substance. Sushi rolls are not fresh or innovative, tastes are so sub par but their price does NOT reflect this standard. They should be ashamed for overcharging poor Vegas tourists who wants some decent sushi. We only went there because it's right across from the Wynn and we wanted to walk a around a bit afterwards. total Disgust! NEVER again! extremely loud music, come'on it's not a night club, it's just a sushi bar, a very poor one indeed. The overall cleanness is hard to tell due to how dark the dinning room is with red lights. Seriously trying to kill your eyesight with those disturbing lights. Service is a joke if you're in for sushi and no cocktails, slow and a bunch of ignorant snubby servers. Ok, Check please!"}
{"text":"Another favorite of mine.  They have excellent food and service.  When I was in Vegas and we were looking for Sushi, we only had a few places that we would go to and this one was always good.  They are right near the strip so its not hard to find and they are right in the middle of everything.  All the big hotels are right across the strip and the mall is right next door.    The lighting is a little dark but the food is amazing.  I love the spicy appetizers and the spicy rolls."}
{"text":"Great service (immediately), great food, definitely get the HOT MESS! It's delish. Good happy hour too! And good people watching outside!!"}
{"text":"It was okay. Our rolls came out before our salads and miso because it wasn't \"hot yet\". I had to ask 3 different people who was not our server for service. We didn't get soy sauce dishes at the beginning which is no biggie. When our miso soup was brought out, it was the shallowest bowl of soup it wasn't even a full serving and it still wasn't hot. I sent it back for a hot bowl, the manager was pleasant when he brought it out. All in all our server was okay at best and the food wasn't anything special I may comeback just because it's in the mall and in a convenient location."}
{"text":"Our server Kalani was more then amazing! She was friendly, attentive, an more. Food was delicious. I highly recommend the garlic edamame and the pineapple cheese wontons their both my favorite!"}
{"text":"From all the sushi places in AZ we ever try , they have really good selection  Sweet , sour, big , small  Name it they have it  I think I visited in more then 50 different ones and I didn't think you can really make bad sushi bc the idea is rice and fish but I found out it's not that easy  Long story short they have the best sushi here in AZ area  Nice service clean  A little bit slow ( only problem )"}
{"text":"I generally like their food just fine,but it's super loud in there and my to-go order took hour instead of the advertised 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Came here with the Bachelorette party for some appetizers to tide us over since dinner was not till 7:30. Managed to come right as happy hour was beginning (3pm to 7pm). Had a couple of drinks (mango margarita was amazing), calamari, Vegas roll, and rainbow roll which we split. Everything was terrific. The calamari was sooo tender and I loved the batter on it. SInce we came for happy hour, everything was cheap and it was a great start to our night out."}
{"text":"Left after being seated for 10 minutes and no server even acknowledged me sitting at the sushi bar. Not sorry I left, dirty. Sticky counter and menus. The person preparing sushi did not have gloves, and did not seem to be washing his hands at all."}
{"text":"I love the variety of sushi rolls.  Everything is fresh and unique.  One downfall, the service has always sucked.  I've been there multiple times and each time the service was horrible."}
{"text":"Ra has an EXCELLENT happy hour, and reverse happy hour on Sundays.  They offer  a lot of sushi rolls, and appetizers half off, along with great drink specials.  My personal favorite rolls on happy hour are the Tootsy Maki and the Las Vegas roll, but they offer several other choices so there's something for everyone!  They have great specials for Sake bombs, and the Blushing Geisha is the tastiest drink they serve (think, raspberry lemonade, spiked).  It's a great environment to go with friends, especially on a Sunday night when they have a DJ spinnin.  Not to mention, the food is delicious.  If you have not tried the Viva Las Vegas roll, you MUST!!  It is incredible!  It has a really laid back ambience about it, and great food.... why wouldn't you check it out? :-)"}
{"text":"Happy hour was awesome!! Can't beat the hot saki they have and the \"ra'ckin roll\" was freaking amazing!!!! Definitely go here for amazing sushi in Vegas! Not badly priced and great food selection."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by this place. We were staying across the street at the Wynn and got tired of the super fancy dinners every night. We decided to go across the street to RA for a little more of a casual experience. I would definitely recommend coming here. I will be back, next time I'm in Vegas.  -atmosphere- classy casual, on the darker side with red lighting and accents.  -drinks- I was drinking beer and sake so kinda hard to screw that one up. My wife enjoyed the variety of cocktails on the menu. She really enjoyed the blackberry cocktail on the menu. Not too sweet and plenty of alcohol.  -food- We started off ordering an albacore roll to share, just feeling the place out. The roll turned out to be really good! That lead us into ordering the sashimi salad which was great. They went a little heavy on the sauce, but it still turned out good. We also ordered the toro nigiri, and another roll. All of our food was great and we didn't have to spend an arm and a leg."}
{"text":"As a server/bartender, I NEVER write Yelp reviews and usually doubt negative reviews most places get and chalk it up to pissy customers. This however, was one of the most unethical things I have ever seen!   During the month of July, Ra is running a 4 for $30 promo with select menu items after 3pm every Wednesday. I receive email notifications from Ra (as a FORMER SERVER FOR RA!) and thought this was a fantastic deal! Hubby and I went for dinner tonight around 8pm and noticed immediately that they did not give us the promo menu along with our reg menus. Thinking it was just a mistake of the host, possibly, I mentioned the promo to the server and she said they were no longer offering the promo. Again. giving them the benefit of the doubt, I say \"are you sure? I received an email about it....and its on the website....\" she then says \"well, it might be other locations, but not this one. are you ready to order?\"  Flabbergasted, I pull up the Fashion Show ad showing the promo advertised, and she continues to insist they are not offering it. We order anyway and I go find a manager. He apologizes, hands me two promo menus and says he will send the server back over to get our corrected order.   I can honestly say that in all my years working in restaurants (and eating in them of course), I have NEVER seen a server blatantly LIE and insist on continuing the LIE even in the face of proof! WTF? Trust me, I get it. I understand that you may think you'll get a lesser tip bc the bill is lower blah blah blah, but still. Have some morals! Its one thing to \"not mention\" the promo, its entirely a different (not to mention unethical) thing to completely deny its existence and refuse to even \"make sure\"! Gotta wonder how many other people have been fed this line of BS and believed it! Now I dont know if this was solely the action of a rogue server, or if it were something they were directed to do by management, but I am more than sure corporate wouldn't be happy to hear this news!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. I came into the restraunt on my work break and my server had absolutely no education on the menu and the items that may or may not contain gluten. Matter if fact he was very wrongly informative about what he \"thought\" he knew. And did but waste my precious time for lunch. Very disappointing. Will not return"}
{"text":"I used to love going here. My husband and I went here today to have a very late lunch. The guy in blue (I think he is one of the managers) said that we could sit anywhere since it's open sitting. It was a pretty slow day, alot of the tables were empty since it was late in the afternoon. We sat there for 15 to 20 minutes and nobody approached us. My husband needed to call the attention of one of the servers before we were given a menu. I tried to put a smile on my face thou I am really pissed because I was really hungry. We ordered a vegas roll and some other types of sushi. We used to love the vegas roll in here but today, it seems to be lacking something. It looks like it's smaller and not fresh. The other types of sushi was ok, not great but just an ok. The chicken yakitori was small. I don't think I will order that again next time. And my husband ordered a beer that was under the craft beer section, but we were both shocked when the server handed him a can and a glass. So maybe we just didn't see the disclaimer with that beer but, I don't know what else to say.    We used to love it in here, maybe we will eat here again but not anytime soon, maybe in a few months or maybe not."}
{"text":"RA is definately one of my favorite Sushi restaurants in AZ. They have great sushi rolls, drinks, and appetizers for non sushi lovers. My favorite rolls are: beef tataki roll (No fish for the non sushi person), lobster mango roll, shrimp tempura roll, and the rainbow roll. Make sure you get the creamy wasabi sauce (comes with the beef tataki roll) or the creamy ponzu sauce (make sure you tell them it comes with the tunacado roll so they get the right sauce) to go with your sushi. These two sauces are amazing! For appetizers, their lobster spring rolls are pretty legit as are their gyoza and calamari. The calamari is always cooked perfect and the mango dipping sauce for the spring rolls is awesome! Ive also tried their pineapple cream cheese wontons and their crab cakes and they were ok though nothing special. For drinks, they have many flavored saki's and specialty drinks that are very good. My fav drinks at RA are the mango margarita, blushing geisha, and the cosmopolitan that are all on their regular happy hour menu and the \"sheso naughty\" which is on  their Wednesday night hump day happy hour menu. Yes on Wednesday, if you go after 8, there are certain appetizers, drinks and sushi rolls that are half off as well. So if you go for regular happy hour, then hold off on ordering anything from 7-8, then you get double happy hour! Regular happy hour is during 3-7 pm every day (including weekends) and its half off certain appetizers, rolls, and drinks. Its a great value! Ive walked away after having 3 drinks, appetizer, and roll for less than 30.00! If you have room, try the tempura ice cream. It is cinnamon ice cream with tempura batter and deep fried, with raspberry sauce drizzled over it. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. MmMm... one of my all time favorite sushi restaurants! I have to eat here when I'm in Vegas. I  like the decor and ambiance of the restaurant too. Happy hour is great. $1 pineapple saki.... you just can't go wrong with that! When my friends and I order, it always seems like we're going overboard, but we just know what we like and we like it all. =) I can't remember everything we order.. but one of my favs is the scallop dynamite."}
{"text":"I went there twice while I was in Vegas.  The first time I tried two rolls -- the vegas roll and another one I forgot the name of.  They looked nice and they were really creative (especially the vegas roll), they tasted okay.  Pretty good, but not great -- it didn't seem like the freshest quality and the texture of the rice was a bit off, like a bit hard maybe?  I do love their menu and the fact that they have such unique rolls, extensive and creative appetizers as well.  The only appetizer I got to try was their calamari, which was thick and yummy, since they were out of their cream cheese pineapple pot stickers.  What I really love about this restaurant is the bar!  I definitely recommend going during happy hour and getting drinks and maybe a roll or appetizers.  They have an extensive cocktail menu with plenty of fruity and sweet drinks, martinis, frozen drinks, sake, and even about a dozen flavored bombers. I loved the red white and blue bomb and the lychee saketini.  The unami punch is pretty good but insanely strong! I enjoyed a few other drinks there but I forgot the names!  I'll definitely give this place a 3rd chance next time I'm in LV."}
{"text":"Order sushi to go. Got home and found that there is   no ginger or wasabi. Not coming again."}
{"text":"I would have named it sushihana but I guess that is why I am not in marketing.  I have been here many times and treated well, Friday night was no exception . When we had arrived it was crowded but the MOD Blake was able to accommodate our group and ensured our first round of drinks made it out in short order.  Their happy hour is pretty good, in addition to many rolls on special they have a few other great items like a seaweed salad. The texture of this salad is quite unique, it is flavored with a sesame ginger dressing.  I was also surprised at the speed that the sushi came considering how busy it was.  They also have many drinks specials including sake bombers for the guys and a Tsunami bowl for the girls.  Overall good deals and great staff like Blake make it one of my favorites on mill to eat or drink at."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Ra since they opened their 1st location in Tempe 15ish years ago, and I am so sorry that the recession seems to have turned this place into the Taco Bell of sushi. My husband and I went for happy hour Sunday night. The best part of the meal was the diet Pepsi. The chicken fried rice patties were like cardboard and had zero flavor. Following suit, the pineapple cream cheese wontons tasted like the cream cheese was way past its expiration date. We also ordered several Las Vegas rolls, which we have always enjoyed. The rolls had a funny taste, a weird consistency and we just decided to pay our bill and leave.  They were grossly understaffed that night as well. 2 waitresses, so they had the hostesses waiting tables too. It was a flustercuck. The super loud music prevented any conversation and also means that we cannot bring our son, who has Sensory Processing Integration Dysfunction because loud and him don't mix. It was sad to see what used to be a great place go to the dumps because they expanded too fast and cut corners on quality. Goodbye Ra."}
{"text":"RA is OK. I like Happy hour mainly for the cheap food and Saki/beer. The sushi on the other hand is just meh! It's good but its not what I consider real sushi or quality sushi. It's Arizona Sushi! Coming from LA and San Diego, this would be pathetic sushi! But some it is OK and I can tolerate it at HH due to the prices. I would not go here during regular hours and regular prices."}
{"text":"Great service - great food - awesome portion size - if your in tow for a convention this place is great for the whole team and very accompanying"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place and had amazing service! The sushi is good, not overly expensive, and they have a really extensive menu with great happy hour that goes late.   Some food highlights: spicy yellowtail roll, spicy tuna on crispy rice, yellowtail sashimi, and spring rolls.   I like to stay at encore in Vegas, and this location is right across the street in the mall. It's a good location and a great option for a nice dinner that won't break the bank!"}
{"text":"Very Americanized sushi Is the feeling k get once I open the menu here. They of course have great flavors and great menu items though! Came in as first timers and tried a few tolls! Forgot the names of them but the fish wasn't as fresh as I usually want to get when I want sushi. Sushi is very easy to cover up with sauces and I feel like for at least the rolls I ordered were full of sauce and just couldn't get the fish to come out of any of the bites I got. Service was great, friendly staff from beggining to end of the visit . Best of all is atmosphere and how nice inside the place is. The decor really gets you going and hits you with high expectation. Unfortunately the prices are very high and of course when you want sushi you expect to pay more than average meals. For their quality fish and such disappointment in how they put so much sauces on their rolls is a disappointment. Not feeling this one unfortunately."}
{"text":"Omg good  This place is to die for! Everything is spectacular! The king crab roll was just ok, but the lobster rolls, the rakin shrimp and shrimp tempura were phenomenal"}
{"text":"Not very good.... the place smelled like a dirty bathroom when you first walk in,  but still wanted to give it a chance, BUT the sushi did not taste fresh at all,  I felt sick to my stomach on the way home. The server was kind and we did tip her but I would not recommend this location for sushi."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi place. My server was Ethan and he was one of the best servers I ever had. He kept me updated on our meals and came to check on us in a timely manner."}
{"text":"RA isn't my choice for *great* sushi, but it's got one of the best happy hours in existence. I went there on a date and got stuffed on sushi and wine for about $15 bucks (me + a date).   I don't recommend it for a \"sushi MEAL\", but as a late night/happy hour destination, it cannot be beat in terms of value. Go for it."}
{"text":"RA is still my favorite sushi place. This is my first time at the Scottsdale location. I usually go to the one on Mill and this one is a lot nicer. There are windows so it makes it lighter inside. The one in mill feels like your eating in a dungeon but I guess that's good for dates. This location also has a patio! Winning!!! The sushi was great like usual! We had appetizers, meals, drinks, and desserts and they were all good! No complaints! Posted a few pics of things we are. The Spring mule is a must try! Very refreshing for the summer!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! Delicious and decent priced. Service was so slow though. Went on a Thursday night and waited forever for the check and drinks to be delivered to the table."}
{"text":"RUDEST WORST RESTURANT EVER!!!! my friend ran into the patio window because they are crystal clear and got a bloody nose not only did the employees not offer any towels or ice they simply asked if she was ok once and walked away I WILL NEVER GO BACK!! All employees are rude not helpful!!! We didn't stay and will NEVER go back DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! NOT WORTH IT"}
{"text":"It had been a while since we had dined at RA, but it was good to see nothing had changed.  Happened in during Happy Hour so we took advantage.  I don't recall the proper name of my drink but it was a frozen bellini basically, date had the Japanese Mule - both were good.  Started with the Ra-ckin Shrimp - that was a meal by itself, shrimp were plump and properly coated.  Date ordered the spicy shrimp soup - that served 3, truth be told - plump shrimp with just enough heat to cause the nose to run.  We took advantage to the happy hour pricing to order a few rolls - crunchy calamari, Tootsy Maki,  and one roll that was not in the HH specials, lobster shrimp.  All of them were tasty - very fresh and extremely filling.  Completed the meal with the coconut creme brulee.  I am not a cb fan but I could eat this entire plate, it's that good. We were early enough that service was not rushed.  Our server gave us plenty of time to enjoy our meal without rushing us out."}
{"text":"Given the price and wait for most sushi places on the strip, this place is a steal. Was seated in minutes on a Saturday night. Chirashi bowl chock full of salmon and sushi sashimi for $12? I couldn't believe it til I laid eyes on it. We also ordered rolls and sashimi; everything was delicious. Minus one star b/c it took a long time for the dishes to come out, and only one ginger/wasabi plate per table (which subsequently made me feel bad for asking for refills multiple times). This is not going to be everyone's cup of tea; if you came to Vegas for quality upscale dining you probably won't find it here. But if you're looking for a filling meal on a budget that's a step up from fast food, this is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This was actually my first Ra that I've been too, and it sure didn't disappoint. We hit the 5pm happy hour after work, and though the place was packed, there was still room and no waiting. But to start, let's talk about the parking; it's Old Town Scottsdale, so you have to expect parking to be crazy, especially on a Friday evening. Fortunately, Ra is located at the end of a street with a massive parking garage. So a short walk and you're there!  The service was great, and even during the busy rush of happy hour, the waitress was prompt when we asked for something. The coolest part of the whole night was actually when we checked in on FourSquare. After checking in, we got a special promo of free edamame and miso soup, all we had to do is show our phones to the waitress. Awesome!  When we ordered, most of us got the Vegas Roll, and what a beautiful dish! The size was smaller than other places (like Koi & Sushi Brokers, they have much bigger portions), but it tasted delicious. At half off because of happy hour, we couldn't argue with a $7 bill for each of us. Outside of happy hour, I wouldn't go, but only because of the size of the rolls. As tasty as they were, it's not worth $14. Sushi Brokers totally has larger servings, and at the same (or less) price."}
{"text":"Incredible service at lunch time. Waitress was on the ball. Finished one plate, they brought me the second. Saki Bomb is great. The itamae was wonderful and very attentive. I made sure to give my compliments. I am forever hooked."}
{"text":"Came by for happy hour on a Wednesday afternoon around 3 pm. Had a good selection of happy hour apples and drinks. Cocktails were well done. Dragon cocktail was tasty. Las Vegas roll was a lot of rice. The seared tuna was worth it. They got our order wrong for one item but they changed it on request. Service was attentive. Overall decent place to grab a quick bite for happy hour on Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, half empty and service was attentive.  Can't complain like some of the other reviews. BUT food is really mediocre.  Ordered their signature and expensive Gojira roll. Thought with a name like that the roll must be huge and stuffed with fish.  WRONG!  Roll was tiny and literally had a smear of spicy tuna.  Really stinky small roll totally not worth the price.  The maguro sashimi seemed fresh, but all the rest of our lunch was really mediocre.  Disappointed overall and would not suggest it unless you absolutely have no other choice."}
{"text":"This was our first dining experience at RA, we were greeted by a very friendly hostess and sat right away. The garlic edamame was to die for, perfectly seasoned and plenty to share. I had the holy shishito chicken, yum!! My husband ordered Tuna Rolls and was very happy. Atmosphere was pleasant, you can sit at the bar, out on the patio, at the sushi bar, or take the traditional table route. Music was good, just loud enough but still able to converse easily. Waitress, I think her name was Caitlin, was super! Very friendly and professional. The manager , Preston, was out on the floor helping and greeting all the patrons. In all a very satisfying experience. We will be returning very soon."}
{"text":"This is the dirtiest place I've come to in a long time. The place is understaffed big time. When we got there we were seated and waited about 15 mins when finally someone came up and asked if we been served yet, we said no and she looked annoyed at the people in the front. Finally when we got to order our drinks it took about 10 mins for her to bring out water and tea, to which she spilled all over the table and my gf. The manger tried to charge us full price with hardly an apology like we're inconveniencing him. Worst manger I've ever had to talk to. Don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"Happy hour rocks, the service is superb and it's in the heart of downtown!  My friends and I meet once a week for happy hour and are staying away from fatty foods, so we've been trying to find healthier options for happy hour.  The happy hour menu has a good selection of sushi rolls, nigiris, appetizers and $5 cocktails.  The HH sushi is decent and worth the savings."}
{"text":"We went to RA last night, having been there before we knew what to expect, but this time, it was a lot worse. The service was terrible, and it wasn't that busy. The Happy hour, have good prices on it, but all of the appetizers are deep fried, and there aren't too many choices for sushi."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp soup, tuna roll and Chilli Ponzu wings. The food here is normally good, and today was no huge exception, except for a hiccup in the food and a serious attitude problem with the waiter (Mark). The soup came without ANY shrimp, not even one. When I asked the waiter, Mark about it, he dismissed it and said he would inquire about it. After an unusually long while, the manager shows up at the table, apologized and took the food away. Mind you, this restaurant is nearly empty, so no one should have been as busy as it took for them to respond. It took Mark forever to check in on us, and when he did he totally ignored me unless I said something directly to him. I don't know of he felt like I ate the shrimp out of the bowl or what, be he obviously had some sort of issue with me. I'm thinking this was a \"one-off\" situation with a server who was having a bad day, but the food was decent so it is what it is."}
{"text":"good reasonably priced sushi place on the strip.  outdoor seating."}
{"text":"I came here again with my boyfriend. It was pretty spur of the moment, I don't even remember what compelled us to come here to be honest. Maybe because we were hungry, right next to the Fashion Show Mall, and it was right around Ra Sushi happy hour time.   When we arrived, the place was pretty empty and the music was pretty low. Besides the lighting, the atmosphere was the complete opposite of the first time I came here when it was jam packed and extremely noisy.   We were seated right away in a comfy booth. The waitress explained the menu and brought out water right away. We decided to order sesame chicken wings, tootsi maki roll, shrimp tempura roll, edemame, and dengaku tofu.   The food came one at a time and we devoured each plate. My favorite dish was probably the chicken wings. They were just so flavorful and perfectly marinated. I also really loved the tofu. My boyfriend didn't enjoy it that much, so I pretty much got it all to myself, which was a nice treat.   All in all, I was surprised at my experience since I wasn't all that fond of this place the first time around. I think it's best to come here sometime in the middle of the week when the place isn't so crazy and you can actually hear the person you're with. If you happen to come at a time like this, it's actually a decent experience. The food was actually pretty good and the service was fast as well."}
{"text":"I love RA and their sushi, but this place can never get my order right. I just tried to get takeout AGAIN tonight and the crunchy shrimp tempura roll didn't have the red bits on it. I'm not a huge sushi fan, so a huge part of what I like about that roll is the crunch because it takes away the cold rice/slimes taste of the seaweed. Other than the guy manager and the one brunette girl that works the host stand (she rocks) the rest of the staff is rude. I want to come here more since I live in Tempe, but the service needs to change."}
{"text":"Great sushi, great drinks, placed an order to go and it wasn't filled correctly but the friendly staff took care of it promptly. Atmosphere is really nice."}
{"text":"Tonight was the first time I came to this restaurant. The whole staff seemed kind of down. The waitress we had was not attentive at all. The first drink I ordered was a pomegranate Mohito. When I got my drink I did not taste any pomegranate. all I tasted was squeezed lime. So when I finally saw my waitress seven minutes later I asked change my drink which they did with no problem. For the money we spent there I expected better service. The sushi was really good. I recommend the mango crab roll that was one of my favorites. If it wasn't for the bad service I would probably go back."}
{"text":"Great sushi here and the happy hour is awesome.   If you order The spicy rolls, ask for extra spicy since they aren't that spicy"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday night. Upon walking in was greeted by the friendly host, as soon as we sat down our sever Shay, a tall stallion-like looking gentlemen provided excellent service and went over the top for our party that night. I've never come across a server like him and we are all truly pleased with how he tended to every need with how busy the establishment was."}
{"text":"We came in last night where it was pretty slow. Aaron was our waiter. Took our order and served the food. He checked on us 2 minutes the food was served. After 10-15 minutes on finishing up the plates, we were looking for Aaron to get a refill of Water. We didn't get a refill of water until we asked for the check.   For a restaurant who doesn't accept Credit Cards with the Chip, Aaron informed us that they only SWIPE and not use the Chip Insert for the Card. This was humiliating to get denied in front of friends and family. I'm curious to see how many customers you tell that to."}
{"text":"Went there for a quick lunch before heading back to LA, the service was a bit disorganized cause they were understaffed. But they tried their best to provide better services, and they were very friendly and polite!   This restaurant is very beautiful, modern yet still classic, the booth was so comfy and relaxing. Hubby was hungover much, he just wanted some extra hot soup, I was hungry, so I ordered quite a few things for myself.   Our lunch: extra hot spicy soup, with side of udon noodles, mackerel sashimi, salmon roe sushi, spicy tuna hand roll and appetizer hot mess.   The spicy soup was so good, did they put this on the menu just for hangover people? Lots of veggies and shrimps in it, the broth was very flavorful and comforting!   Raw things were fresh and tasty, the appetizer hot mess was spicy king crab on crispy rice, it was delicious but just a little too creamy for me, and it was a big plate for myself, left out all the crispy rice, shame on me!   Overall we liked the food so much! They couldn't make a Bloody Mary for me at the moment cause the bartender stepped out for a good 10 minutes, when she came back in she found out they just ran out of Bloody Mary mix... well, I ordered a mimosa instead, it was tasty.    A decent sushi restaurant at fashion show mall, good spot for lunch, they have TVs in the patio, good for summer nights, and they open till late everyday!"}
{"text":"Good food, happy hour, and drinks!  Its a little pricey but less than most places on the strip."}
{"text":"We decided to sit outside because the night was so nice. The \"patio\" was along side the road and speakers filled the night with really, really loud music. It was so loud it was kind of funny. We couldn't hear the waitress or each other sometimes. A nice touch but a little over done.   We had the crispy soft shell crab as a starter. I took one bite and the wife took about six. The rest stayed on the plate. Don't order this.   The Ultimate Shrimp Tempura arrived next. It was pretty good, something I would order again. It would have been better with a little tobiko but I suppose I am not really a sushi chef...   We had the Tunacado as well. The only thing wrong with this was that it wasn't double the size. The Tuna was fresh and so was the avocado. The sauce in the middle was really good.   The next thing to try was the Tuna Tataki. Being that the Tunacado was so good. For some reason it wasn't quite as good as the Tunacado. Must have been the sauce or something. It was still nice but the Tunacado is better.   We also ordered the Zonie roll. Spicy Salmon (which we substituted Ahi for), cucumber, cilantro, jalapeno and topped with avocado and sriracha. After I ordered it I decided to Google sriracha. Turns out its Thai hot sauce. The Thai know how to do hot. I enjoyed it but it only came with a dab on each piece of the roll and any more would have been overpowering. I really liked the fact that we could substitute the salmon out and the Ahi was great.  Maybe I am a sushi chef after all..."}
{"text":"Had so much sushi and it was all really good. Don't even remember what exactly I got but I will say the last Vegas roll was awesome"}
{"text":"i was sooooo excited that this was right across the street from my hotel when i went! i love this place and their food is delicious! great ambiance even though it is super dark. the food is DELICIOUS the service is AWESOME efficient and friendly host and servers the bar is great. awesome selection great menu!"}
{"text":"After passing this up for other sushi places in the area a few friends and I stopped in one night, we drank and ate surprisingly the food was fantastic and well priced, the music was good and the gals were hot.. The atmosphere was fun and the staff treats you well.  Being from California I have ate at many sushi bars but I must say I was pleasantly surprised and will defiantly be eating there more often."}
{"text":"pricy, and kind of unclean. I ordered a las vegas roll and some other shit, he reached in the fridge, right in front of me..pulled out a premade roll, dolloped some shit on it and handed it to me. I've waited longer for a fucking hamburger at mcdonalds..The seared tuna I ordered was also seared in advance. I asked the guy about it, and he said: \"We make like 500 a day.\" I replied \"how many do you think they make in japan?\"..disappointing, lazy, and super gamey tasting shit. Oh, and ask me like ten more times if I want to join your fucking birthday club."}
{"text":"Good sushi and best deals at lunch and happy hour! My favorites are the yummy tuna tacos and Vegas roll are to die for. The chirashi bowl is tasty lunch."}
{"text":"My go to lunch spot on the strip. They offer a great deal on drinks but you have to check the chalkboard out front for the specials because they vary. Usually its $5 for a beer and sake. The lunch specials are perfect and priced well. I like to get the Sashimi combo, and it comes with 4 meaty slices of tuna,yellowtail,salmon & tuna for $14 also comes with miso/salad/rice. They also take care of their industry people and give a discount, so let them know where you work! Shout out to Sarah and Akilah who are bartenders there in the afternoon, theyre always working hard and prepping, while still maintaining conversation at the bar top and being alert to other guests and orders. Super attentive, great service."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout. Totally got my order wrong. The guy that took down my order obviously did not know the menu and was not familiar with the Japanese names. That being said the food was decent but nothing special."}
{"text":"Always have a great time here. Service is always on point and gorgeous. The atmosphere is always hi energy and musics great. This is a great place to pre-game at before a night on Old Town.

{"text":"Good service, poor food. I went for happy hour before departing Vegas. Happy hour prices for food & drink are reasonable. Nice waitress too.  The food. Soggy sweet cucumber sunimono salad. Tuna sushi - not fresh tasting. Yellow tail sushi tasting rice not seasoned well. Spicy yellow tail roll - pretty good. \"Crab\"/eel roll - sweet and poor quality. Not all real crab and just a bad marriage of flavors. Saki - not hot. Nice location, good people watching, crummy sushi."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what happened to this place...their sushi used to be phenomenal and service was always amazing regardless of location. After my most recent visit and the visit before that I can now say I will never go back..their food is mediocre and their service is even worse! After my roll was set down at our table without any chopsticks, soy spice, wasabi or ginger I had asked for some and the manager completely walked away from me and we did not see anyone for a hotbed 15 minutes...after finally receiving the rest of my food I asked if I could get a water refill that never came. They incorrectly made one of my rolls and I sent it back, only to find it on my check. Took her another 10 minutes to fix the check. Done with RA....very sad"}
{"text":"Pretty decent sushi for when I'm craving some. Love their bara chirashi bowl \"most of the time\" and garlic edamame. Service is a hit and miss. Sometimes you're just standing around waiting to be seated because nobody is in the front.    The boyfriend and I came in to grab something to eat right after the movies. He ordered the beef teriyaki bowl and I ordered the bara chirashi bowl. I wasn't given a fork so I had to request one. The one that our waitress gave me was dirty. She was looking at the fork and handed it to me anyways like I'm not going to notice it and walked away. Seriously?! She must of been deaf or something because I kept saying excuse me but she ignored me like she couldn't hear me calling her. I had to flag down another waitress to get a new clean one. To say the least I was annoyed.   On to the food. The boyfriend said his teriyaki bowl was alright. It was mostly all rice and hardly any meat. He only ate the meat and veggies leaving most of the rice in the bowl. As for my bara chirashi bowl, it wasn't as good as before but it was fulfilling and decent. Well...at least our water is on point every time we come to RA."}
{"text":"Never had a bad experience at this place, the service is amazing. I would recommend the tempura rolls, California and Vegas rolls. Also a really nice vibe on weekend nights!"}
{"text":"Everyone is so friendly at this location. My husband and I come here only when there is a movie in theaters that we are looking to see but the bartenders always remember us and our order. We feel like regulars even though we are only here about once a quarter."}
{"text":"Overall, more of a 3.5. Been here more than 3 times so it's review time! Food is definitely 3 stars for me. Nothing really has me craving to go back here and I can already think of a handful of places that I'd rather go to but the location and lower pricing for what's expected of a sushi joint on the strip gives it an extra half star. Everyone is always friendly and the seating inside has a nice date night feel. The go-tos when I come are:  Garlic Edamame: I could drink the garlic sauce. Super flavorful and comes with a good amount of perfectly cooked edamame. I even dip sushi pieces into the leftover sauce lol bomb. $5.30  Mango Lobster Roll: lobster mix, avocado & cucumber rolled with mango on top served with mango & kiwi. Their \"lobster mix\" is basically imitation crab, I never taste any lobster at all but I love the mango and kiwi sauce. $11.25  Viva Las Vegas Roll: crab and cream rolled inside, light tempura deep fried and topped with spicy tuna, crab mix and light lotus root finished with eel sauce and shrimp tempura pieces. Pretty good and always a hit with the relatives visiting from out of town. $13.25  They also have lunch specials daily from 11am-3pm.  Overall a nice addition to fashion show mall. A good option after a day of shopping if you're craving something lighter and lower priced however I wouldn't come here out of my way, only if I was already at fashion show. 3.5/5"}
{"text":"I'm typically a big fan of RA sushi. This was my first time at this location since my gym is around the corner and it was convenient at the time. It took about 6 minutes for a bar tender to introduce the self and ask for drink orders, another 10 minutes to receive the waters we asked for and by then we knew what we wanted to order so we went ahead and ordered the food. Literally... 25 minutes for my buddy to get his 1st roll... and it then took 40 minutes (from order) for my poke bowl which was not what I expected- much smaller and not that delicious) and his teriyaki bowl to arrive. Once we finished... I had to ask the bartender if he put in the order for my Rainbow roll that I ordered with the other items- to which I asked to cance and close out since I was still overwhelmingly hungry and dissatisfied thus far. He gave me a voucher for $8 to use on my next visit since he felt bad. He was cool, but the place was so crowded that it affected our visit, our order, our drinks (which were refilled once in the time we were there), etc. not a pleasant experience and more of a let down than anything"}
{"text":"I don't know why so many of you are hating on this place. Great atmosphere, not bad staff, reasonable sushi - all in all a great place for Sushi located on the vibrant Mill Ave area near ASU."}
{"text":"Love this place! The Spicy miso soup is my absolute favorite! The happy hour is great! Five star, I recommend :-)"}
{"text":"They have flavored Sake! I had the peach and it's smooth like candy! Awesome atmosphere friendly staff the food was delicious definitely can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Shaymus our waiter made our experience exceptional. Food was great however avocado roll had a few brown spots but loved the rest of the food and service!"}
{"text":"I am no sushi pro, but I can taste the difference in raw fish when its high quality and fresh.  Why this place has any reviews under 3 stars is shocking to me. If the parking situation and prices were lower it would be an easy 5. So basically if this spot wasn't on the strip it would be ideal to me. Although I did enjoy the outdoor seating which included plenty of good people watching. (Fun times at the fashion show mall on Christmas eve) But overall, I had a wonderful experience.  To start, we (my sister and I) decided to check out the all day happy hour they offered on the holiday. They did this both Black Friday and Christmas eve, so I am guessing this is a normal holiday or shopping day thing for Ra. Our other halves don't do sushi, so we enjoy exploring new places. The menu pricing seemed high, so all day happy hour was the perfect opportunity.  We began our meal with a garlic sesame style edamame. No doubt about it I will order this every single time I come. Why places have not been doing this forever is the real question! We went with a couple classics like a philly roll and shrimp tempura. The tempura roll came with asparagus, Total win to me. I also ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll. A mix of many things topped with spicy crab and a crunchy wheel. I can't even explain it. Just trust that this is the roll you DO NOT want to miss! It started to get cold after the sun wasn't in view anymore so I ordered a Miso HOT! soup. It came out in a rod iron steel type bowl and had shrimp and green beans in it. I will come back for this alone. (well and that amazing edamame!)  I really wanted to try the hot mess balls as well. A spicy tuna, jalapeno, deep fried ball type thing. Not too sure what it is, but I will be finding out soon!  Also the white sangria was super sweet, and the Cucumber Collins was a perfect afternoon. refreshing, nice buzz but not too strong type of drink. Although they didn't give us the happy hour discount on the sangria. We didn't complain because the difference was only $1.75. The real happy hour specials are the rolls. Also, if you're not into sushi they had many shrimp options, and even a couple beef and chicken dishes. I would suggest trying it during one of their many happy hours!"}
{"text":"We went to RA on Saturday for date night.  Wow, were we surprised at out visit.  We have eaten there before and were not disappointed, but this time was not a treat.  We arrived at 6:30 and they were about half full.  We thought they would be packed for a Saturday night.  The music that was playing was so loud that it made you flinch.  We sat at a 2 top and had to yell across the table the entire time.  Not fun.  When our server did finally arrive, she was pleasant.  However, she could not answers our questions and had to keep going to the kitchen for information.  I am not talking about crazy questions either, I just wanted to know if their green tea had caffeine or not.    We eat sushi often so we are always eager to try something new.  We ordered 4 items.  The first one we received was something we didn't order.  We didn't realize it until the correct one came next.  No worries, not a big deal.  Every plate was brought to us by a different person, which I appreciate the teamwork and making sure our food gets to us freshly made.  The sushi was warm, room temp at best.  The flavors were bland, even the on with jalapenos in it.    We couldn't even tell anyone that we were not please with our food because no on came back to check on us.  When our server finally did come back to drop the check, she asked us how everything was and we told her it was not delicious and we would have rather told her that 30 minutes earlier but she was MIA.  She looked embarrassed and offered us a dessert.  I told her that if we didn't like the dinner, why would we even want to try a dessert.  She spun around, flipped her long hair and walked off into the sunset.  There are far too many great local restaurants to eat at and support to waste your time and money on mediocre.  So now we look for another great sushi restaurant that would like our business."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of sushi and my family and I got in to vegas pretty late. We were staying at Trump hotel and walked over to Ra Sushi. Lucky for us, they had their happy hour menu starting at 10 PM. We ordered a drink, and had a few dishes from their regular menu/ hh menu. All of the dishes were served very well, and our server was very attentive. Definitely a sushi spot worth checking out. I'd assume on the weekeds it would get more crowded, so it be best to make that reservation. ;) ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I give them three stars for being within walking distance, and having a pretty good happy hour food menu. I wouldn't consider trying anything exotic here However, for 2$ salmon nigiri, Ra does a good enough job. The drinks are still pretty expensive, even during happy hour The crowd is full of d-bags, but I usually just ignore them and sit on the patio in my own happy little world :)"}
{"text":"Ra is a sushi bar located on Mill Ave so it is usually busy and packed with college students. The atmosphere is trendy and loud so if you're looking for a quiet meal go somewhere else. My boyfriend and I ate here last night because they have a reverse happy hour every Sunday night from 8pm to 11pm. We sat at the bar and ordered some pineapple wontons. You get four wontons, they are filled with onions and cream cheese, and it comes with pineapple sauce. They were okay but nothing to brag about. We also ordered a yellowtail roll and crispy spicy tuna. The roll was good and the crispy spicy tuna was amazing! Overall I was pleasantly surprised the food was so good and the service was great as well."}
{"text":"Great sushi, big portions. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"RA, ha ha ha ha ok enough laughing lets talk about the restaurant this location was terrible. Upon approaching the restaurant I noticed that there was hardly anyone inside. Came up to the front door and I noticed like hundreds of greasy finger prints on there glass doors, oh well so they dont like to clean there glass windows, no biggy.   We got seated pretty quickly being that there were very little people there that night. Ordered viva las Vegas and spicy tuna and a California roll, all were pretty terrible. We also ordered garlic lemon edamame and it was pretty good but there is a pit where all the juice and chili garlic all falls into and then you're forced to fish them out with some chopsticks.   The service was ok, the waitress really never came back after she took our order. Some other girl brought out our sushi instead and that was about it, the next time we seen our waitress was when she brought us our check. Would I come back? heck no, this place sucked all around reason for the laughter, oh well at least I got a good laugh out of it."}
{"text":"It'd actually been a while since I'd been to a Ra that wasn't for drinks on a Sunday happy hour.   I was in the area with my boyfriend and we always go to this shopping center for the yogurt and we always pass Ra. I guess I couldn't remember just WHY I block Ra out of my mind until it slipped and I decided to give it another shot.  Bad idea.  It was a very very slow lunch, so when we walked in we were surprised to see no one at the host stand. We waited for a few minutes and finally a manager appeared to seat us. Our server appeared shortly after we were sat. I don't even remember her name, but she wasn't bad at all. She was probably the best thing about the whole experience - but that's not saying much.  Anyway, my boyfriend ordered the beef teriyaki lunch but he wasn't a huge fan. I didn't try it so I can't say much else about it. I ordered freshwater eel nigiri - hard to mess up, spicy tuna roll - also hard to mess up, but it was also nothing special - and a softshell crab roll. I was definitely not a fan. The roll had too many other things in it that contradicted the crab - I ended up taking out the carrots and asparagus - too hard to put in a sushi roll! I was so put off by the roll that I didn't even finish it. It was a pretty expensive roll that should have just been kept simple like all other sushi places.   For dessert, we ordered the banana maki. Again, it was nothing too special. Overall, I wasn't impressed and was reminded why I stayed away from Ra. I think they try too hard to make different and unique rolls that it ruins the flavor of it. I'll only go back to Ra MAYBE for the Sunday happy hours, if ever."}
{"text":"It was a lot better than what I have expected. The service was great and the ambiance was cool too. My girlfriend and I ordered the LV roll which was okay, but the better dish we ordered was the spicy salmon bowl. 4/5!"}
{"text":"I have been to RA in AZ and NV, they never disappoint, great food and sushi, and happy hour until 7 pm.   The only problem is that is not all you can eat so instead of spending $25 for AYCE, you end up spending $60-$80 for the same portions.  The staff at this location was outstanding, and kept coming back to us during happy hour to let us take advantage of the lower pricing.  It is on the strip and can get crowded, but it is my 2nd favorite sushi place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Calamari was to die for, beer & saki was excellent! Miguel was a perfect and most helpful waiter."}
{"text":"I think I'm a pretty easy guy to please, at least after reading a lot of reviews on Yelp.  I have had such few poor experiences at pretty much any business that I would have to rack my brain to think of one.  This is one of them.  Note: I went here two years ago.  I was new to Arizona, and wanted to try out the sushi locales.  I walk into this business to see the ditzy blonde hostess standing there, looking bored.  Me: \"I'd like a seat, please.\" DBH rolls her eyes.  \"Just you?\" Me: \"...  Yes.\"  I am then seated in the corner by the restrooms, with the rest of the restaurant being empty.  I wait 20 minutes for my food, which tastes fine to me.  All the while, I am ignored by the wait staff.  This continues as I run out of water, and as I finish my food and wait awhile for my check.  I leave a tip of 10 cents and walk out, stunned by the experience.  I had taken it personally until I read the reviews of all the other people on here.  I guess I should feel better that it wasn't just me that Ra Sushi seemed to dislike so intently."}
{"text":"Stopped in whie in town for spring training this weekend. Atmosphere is cool, sushi was great, and had a great server. Anthony helped us out and since we had never been we asked his opinion on what to order. He offered great suggestions on rolls and sake. Went on a Saturday night and only had to wait 10 minutes for a seat. Overall, very satisfied with RA."}
{"text":"I went here on what was possibly the worst date I have ever had in my life. However, Ra and their staff get five stars for treating me with kindness and dealing with the drunk that I was with. Oh yeah...and the Viva Las Vegas Roll was awesome! I'll be back with a sober date or one of my girlfriends to have more sushi."}
{"text":"Food was really good.. service sort of disappeared after dropping off our food.. so we went without drinks until I eventually went in and refilled myself! But again.. the food was really good!!"}
{"text":"I'm nearly ashamed to admit I've eaten here.  Twice.  The first time, I didn't pay for it (thank christ). I remember the bill clearly. Server took the docket, looked inside (it was like, $20 more than the bill - way over 20%) and rudely inquired, \"Do you need change?\" My dining partner, clearly taken aback and never intending to give the twit a 30% tip, uttered a reluctant, \"Uh...no. I guess not.\"  The second, I couldn't even talk to my friend. It was too frickin' loud. Stupid loud. Like a club. But you sit down here and overpay for food. I ordered a few items. Waitress moron (different idiot this time) had the gall to correct my pronunciation. I speak Japanese. She did not. But clearly, she was 20 and a waitress at Ra which therefore trumped my language legitimacy.  The  service  here  is  really  bad.  Again, it pains me to have to say it, but this \"restaurant\" is another that does not know what Japanese food is. Yes they have the hiragana \"ra\" character accurately depicted in their decor. Yes, red and black is used to create that dark, moody, hip, trendy, \"exotic\"  feeling or somesuch. Yes, there is some raw fish behind a glass bar. But this alone does not make a Japanese restaurant.   Ra thinks so, however. I beg to differ. The rolls look like something a kid that ate alot  of crayons threw up all over. Mango, lime, red - WTF?!?! There's nothing balanced, pleasurable, or memorable about their taste. The apps are so unimpressive. You can get half of what they offer in the freezer section of any Asian market. Sake? Some of the cheapest out there with a ridiculous markup. Fish is not fresh or cut correctly for sushi, from what I could see. Nigiri? I wouldn't even dare. That's Japanese for the sushi rice with a small slice of fish on top. But what would I know? Let me check with my waitress. Since she peddles here for the dinner shift, she must be automatically fluent."}
{"text":"Kind of expensive, since its on the strip.  The best part of this place, and it ain't the sushi....  They have a very large bar with a variety of drinks and sake bombs...for a sushi joint there bar is bigger than there sushi bar.  Franchize place, focus on white-anglo-saxson western  clientale  The only good part of this place is the service and the atmosphere, its kind of loud."}
{"text":"I come to this little sushi spot in the mall every single time i come to Vegas. The location is convenient, the hours open are good for Vegas late night bites, and the decor is cute. I also like that they have an indoor and outdoor eating area. I should preface this review by saying I don't eat sushi at all. The reason I come here is i like the atmosphere, I like the drinks, and I LOVE the spicy chicken udon noodle dish. I have had other snacks and appetizers here too, all good. I always get wonderful service from the wait staff and host stand. I have brought friends with me here that ordered sushi and I have heard no complaints. I will keep coming back here every time I go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for lunch and it never wow's me. the service is always eh and the food is just alright. I do enjoy their soups and i know with them you def get your money's worth but there is nothing that makes it stand out in my mind when I am deciding on a place to eat. The prices are typical strip menu prices so I'd def stick to their lunch specials. The miso hot soup is something I'm always drawn to though when I find myself there. for $7 dollars I leave full and warm. the service needs some help though."}
{"text":"Really yummy sushi for good prices. I've been coming here for years. Love the location and the staff. My favorite roll is the viva las Vegas roll."}
{"text":"Ra never disappoints. I have yet to get a roll that I didn't like; even the most basic roll (California roll) is amazing, we get this every time we come even though I don't like to get it anywhere else. The \"RA\" kin' roll is a little pricey but one of my all time favorites. Don't forget the 4-7 happy hour menu at the back. Only downfall here is the volume, not terrible though."}
{"text":"i usually love music, but this place is obnoxious. can't carry a conversation, and yelling on top of my lungs while eating makes me frustrated enough to leave w. an aciddy stomach. bad miso, so-so food.   ugh."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and cheap drinks? No complaints from me here :)  I went twice last week--once in the daytime and then at night. At night it has more of a club-like vibe with mainstream hip hop being played here.  It's a good spot to stop at if you're hungry but don't want something too heavy on your stomach (my girl and I were going to a pool party, so we didn't want the bloated stomach look haha).  If you like tempura, definitely try the tropical roll. It has mango in it and is just sooo yummy!  If you're a tourist from the DMV like us, and you really like RA, they have a location up in Baltimore."}
{"text":"I wasn't that impressed with this restaurant when we are there a month ago, food was mediocre and tables were dirty. I just read that they were featured in Dirty Dining this week for for 38 demerits.  http://www.jrn.com/ktnv/news/dirty-dining/Dirty-Dining-Asian-Buffet-and-Ra-Sushi-269299381.html?lc=Smart"}
{"text":"If you've ever planned a bachelorette party for a large group of girls, you'll know that it's not a simple or easy feat.  I had the honor of throwing one for my best friend this weekend and Ra was a large part of why it was successful.  if you've never heard of it, they have this thing called \"Fling Before the Ring\" where you can do a pre-fixe menu with appetizers, sushi, dessert, and one cocktail.  It is the perfect amount of food, the perfect price, and the service is impeccable.  Although I was too intoxicated to remember everything about the meal, I do remember the cream cheese egg rolls and they are to die for.  Our server was equally awesome, she was really helpful when I knocked my bright red drink all over my bright yellow shirt."}
{"text":"I totally love this place.  They have an interesting selection of rolls that are actually reasonably priced! The Pacific Roll was the table's favorite, jalapenos, tuna, avocado, yum. We also really loved the Dynamite Scallop roll, lots of meat in the rolls.  I actually prefer this place to Nobu. There. I said it."}
{"text":"Disappointed that I lived here a year before discovering this place. Was nervous about some of the reviews and feel the bad reviews got it wrong. Very cool vibe, great service. Had a Rainbow and Shrimp Tempura Roll and Sake. Very enjoyable Mill Experience."}
{"text":"Good sushi, had a number of different but the spicy tuna is always great. A bit pricy given a relatively simple interior and it \"only\" being sushi. Tastewise the food is good and a nice alternative to all the mexican and us food in the area"}
{"text":"Good food but of course it's pricey.  What is difficult about ordering at Ra is that you are not always sure about the portion sizes of the menu items.  I wish there were more pictures of the item or maybe the staff should be better about letting you know that you ordered the equivalent of an appetizer for your entree.  My husband had to ask for the menu to order additional food because he was still hungry after eating the 2 things he had ordered.  So make sure you know what you are ordering.  I do give the waitress props for asking me if I liked my alcoholic drink she made for me!  She said it wasn't mixed right or if I didn't like it then she would get another one made for me.  This was great customer service.    We also ordered dessert for the first time here and it was amazing!  We ordered the cinnamon tempura gelato which is a battered cinnamon-swirl gelato, flash fried & finished with a chocolate-raspberry glaze.  It come out in 4 pieces so it's great for sharing!  Although it's so good you might not want to share.   One thing I always dislike about this place is that it is way too loud to have a conversation.  Maybe it's me and I'm just getting old but I don't know many young hip kids that can afford to eat at Ra so I wish they would re-examine their clientele and adjust the volume accordingly."}
{"text":"(+) -chicken katsu bento box was alright  (-) -crappy waitress -sauce for chicken katsu  Randomly decided to eat here while we were at the mall. Got here at just the right time to catch the end of lunch priced bento boxes and the beginning of happy hour deals. The waitress took forever to come and take our orders and the food took forever to come out even though it didnt seem all that busy. Not only that, she forgot to put in my friends soda order and then forgot to put in her sushi order. say bye bye to your tip lady!  I got the chicken katsu bento box which didn't look like much, chicken katsu seemed lacking but it definitely filled me up. Everything was acceptable except for the sauce that came with it in a separate little dish which I really disliked and didn't use at all.  Mediocre experience, service really turned me off. They do have some good happy hour deals that Id wanna come back and check out but 2 stars for this particular experience."}
{"text":"The menu is exactly the same as the one in Kierland but I like the other restaurant better. It's always fun to be in old town and RA sushi is probably the best sushi I know of in Phoenix area but this restaurant in much smaller and also far less crowded.  I wouldn't say not to go here but a few miles up the road is a better RA."}
{"text":"RA is a sushi place for rookies.  Not that thats a bad thing, my first sushi experience, like so many other midwest transplants, was here, with the oh-so-daring California roll.  Now, I'd like to think of myself as a much more knowledgeable sushi fan, graduated long ago from the ranks of RA.  Thats not to say that I dont still like to pop in for happy hour from time to time (although their happy hour menu isnt too impressive...the only rolls being spicy tuna and the cali roll) or better yet, reverse happy hour on Sunday nights.  The greater Old Town population has been to RHH at RA at least a handful of times and will continue to go back regardless of how skinny the rolls are.  Why?  Because everyones doing it.  And because of the cheap saki bombs.  And because of the hot wait staff.  Hey, I call a spade a spade.    Ge there early to avoid a hellacious wait or to grab a seat at the bar and watch the rookies roll in.  No pun intended."}
{"text":"Waitress was slow we almost walked out.  Sushi was decent.  I would rave but we ordered basic rolls which IMHO a decent sushi place should never screw up (nigiri sake, hamachi, maguro, and a rainbow roll. The bento box was basic as well as the miso."}
{"text":"It's very expensive, and far from authentic, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't some awesome sushi all the same.   Viva Las Vegas roll is one of their signatures, and so is the Scallop Dynamite. As someone that likes cream cheese in sushi rolls, these two were definitely right up my alley.   However, 12 bucks a roll is craaaaaazy.   Still good though! I'm sure it's not the most expensive sushi on the strip either."}
{"text":"I love the concept of Ra. The crowd and scene work nicely. However, the sushi is consistently warm. YUK! I have tried to go back several times and to different locations to determine if it was just a bad night, but no such luck. Plus, I have heard this from several other people who won't go back.   My hope in writing this is that someone from Ra reads it and amps up their sushi attention."}
{"text":"Ra is a chain sushi restaurant so you know what you are going to get. Not the best, but certainly not the worst.   Happy hour is the perfect time to visit. You can get great HH specials both drinks and snacks, but don't expect the freshest or best sushi you have ever had."}
{"text":"Not the best, not horrible. Waitress not being able to make a recommendation or knowing what anything is, pretty lame. This place is very overrated."}
{"text":"I have been to Ra many times and it's usually very consistent with a great atmosphere.  When I visited this location everything was pretty much okay although the tables could've been a little bit more cleaner, smudging and spreading the food on the table does not really make it cleaner! The food is great as usual BUT the reason why they got the two stars and disturbed me the most was when we left I saw one of the sushi chefs working with no gloves!!! He served sushi, cut veggies, handling the ginger and the food with HIS BARE HANDS!!! Non of the managers/ staff or waitresses didn't say anything or just didn't care!! I still love Ra and will probably go back no question about it but not to this location!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why Ra get's such a bad rap.  The sushi is pretty good -- not outstanding, but middle of the road.  There are many other places to go for better sushi, but this place is still solid.  Plus there are many non-sushi appetizers that are quite good.  The \"scene\" may be a little too distracting for some.  So if you want to enjoy your food in some peace and hear the conversation of your companions, this bar is not the place to do it."}
{"text":"I really love the atmosphere here. Really good spot for groups or first dates! Bar like vibe (there is a bar attached), you also have the option of sitting at a booth, sushi bar, or outside. Whatever tickles your fancy! Food is pretty good, I wouldn't say the best but this isn't the kind of sushi place you go to for amazing sushi, it is after all a chain. I really enjoy coming here and love the feel! You can hop on over to the bar next door for a prolonged evening or the opposite side to go see a movie, great location too."}
{"text":"RA is amazing! We got the surf and turf roll and the Rackin Roll! They were amazing! Atmosphere is upbeat and fun for a date night!"}
{"text":"Ok food was amazing! Chile ponzu yellow tail role was amazing. Best role I've ever had. Our waiter was Channah and she was amazing, so sweet and perfect service. Unfortunately this drink, the grape cosmo, was terrible. Bartenders approved her serving us the drink, which was only meant for the bar area. The drink was awful, tasted like cough medicine, and the bartender was giving her a hard time about making us a new drink. Overall, bartenders made a crappy drink and blamed the situation on our server who treated us incredibly well. Cheers to Channah!"}
{"text":"I visit this spot for the Happy Hour.   3-7pm.    The Viva Las Vegas Roll is pretty delicious & fancy if made right.  Sometimes, I've had it look like a disaster during Happy Hour.  Other times, it looks like a work of art.  it depends how busy they are.   But always tastes decent.  The music in the restaurant is uncomfortably loud & dark.  On permanent night club setting.  Whenever I see little kids eating here, I question their parents' decisions.  Even during Happy hour, their drinks are expensive.  I always go home disappointed by their cocktails... even with the discount... because they're just not good.  Stick with beer.  All in all, mehh... if you're really hard up for somewhere to go, it's an experience."}
{"text":"I have been to RA a handful of times for happy hour, and was always annoyed by the loud music and crowd.    However, this time I went here for happy hour as a first stop for a Bachelorette party and I had a great time. The upbeat social atmosphere was great for getting the night started. The group ordered a ton of appetizers and rolls, and even a drink each, and we walked out at about $30 a piece. The elderberry mixed drink was especially good.  Normally, I do not pick this place for sushi happy hour because I don't like their quality of sushi and like quieter placed to relax with a friend or two. But if your going for a fun group atmosphere, this place is perfect. But only during happy hour, otherwise it is definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"SLOW! These people move like snails. Ordered 2 sushi dishes and a round of drinks. Sushi took 40 minutes to come out and the drinks took 15 minutes. The place wasn't that busy, it was steady. They even had 5 sushi chefs working. The food at this RA is nothing spectacular. If you want great service go to RA in Ray road 1000x better. I would fire management at this RA."}
{"text":"Johnna at the bar is one of the best she is great with everyone she is funny and knowledgeable of the menu she is a joy beautiful personality"}
{"text":"For years I have been hearing about this place and just hadn't had the stars align to allow for a taste until a few weeks ago. Meh...  Nothing special. All the pretentiousness of a scottsdale bar with all the work ethic you'd expect from ASU student waitresses.   There are SOOOOO many other places to go for sushi...this place won't make my list of choices again."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant was great! Really good sushi and the prices were more reasonable being at the north end of the strip in the mall. I had a sashimi mixed plate that was only $18 and it came w soup and salad."}
{"text":"Love this place especially at lunch.  Atmosphere is terrific, and lunch specials are very well priced.  Today was made even better by our server, bartender, Samantha.  She greeted us with a warm smile remembering who we are and what we normally order.  She is a delight and we plan to come back again to see her."}
{"text":"Moses hates his life:( he needs to love it bc it made for horrible service. Food was good except the veggie roll. It's rice wrapped around lettuce. Thank god for the sake. Yolo"}
{"text":"Late night sushi cravings led us to this joint. I will say that I am a fan and will return. The food was pretty darn good, but when you've had Nobu (Malibu), it kinda of hard to be impressed with something basic. I was not expecting a high-end dining experience, so we were satisfied. Everything was pretty fresh for late night.  The vegetable tempura roll was one of the best I've had. The avocado roll was creamy and delicious. The service was friendly and helpful. The prices were cool and satisfactory. Great date spot.....and lots of cool shopping nearby."}
{"text":"I saw the rating for this Ra and thought, \"it can't be that bad\"... but I was wrong.  The miso soup came out cold, it took forever to place our order, receive it and receive the check, the chips & salsa app came out after the entrees (???) and nothing was nearly as good taste wise as the one at La Encantada in Tucson. Sad."}
{"text":"AWFUL experience at RA SUSHI Bar! I really hate giving out ONE star reviews but talk about a complete shit show. So I have been to a couple of the other locations in different cities including Atlanta where I use to live and I have never received the type of service that was exhibited today! For starters let's talk about how excited I was to actually eat here and how that excitement quickly turned into a \"sorry I even bothered situation\"  I had some girlfriends visiting from out of town and they were in the mood for drinks and sushi and suggested that since we were already meeting at Fashion Show Mall to of course try RA! Upon being seated I was greeted by a friendly waiter and had our tables order taken shortly after that. Turns out it was happy hour and we didn't even know it so we all ordered a round of drinks! 1 strawberry patron margarita..1 cucumber and lastly my traditional! After one sip I literally gagged because I said to myself \"there's no way in hell this is a patron margarita\" my friend said the same about hers.. Completely watered down and just not how that particular drink should taste! Here's the thing as a drinker that has a drink of some sort on the regular your taste buds know how it should be.. Today that wasn't the case.. Asked for a new drink and I kid you NOT it took a whole 15-20 for my newly made drink and at this point I was beyond livid that my food hadn't even came but yet my friends were more than halfway done with theirs and I'm sitting there flabbergasted! Really? Like our waiter had nothing to say other than he was sorry.. The bartender had to be new or was just that awful on not only her pour on the drinks but just in general. My problem is that they weren't even busy.. Not that that would make a difference but I'm trying to give the benefit of doubt..   While we were wrapping up the manager Dave comes by to ask how everything was. Hmm of course I explained everything to him that I just typed above and let him know that this was completely out of the standards that I had for RA! He simply responded with \"well I'm sorry but that's illegal to water the drinks down and I'm sorry you had the experience..here is a free appetizer card for the next visit..bye\" like really? Oh and then they thought that just taking $4 off those late ass margaritas they served us was going to be a peace offering? No thanks! I will never go out of my way to be back and take a chance on being bamboozled again.. Super disappointed with the lack of professionalism and just the approach that he took as a manager. What ever happened to looking the part? He strolled up in some jeans an oversized flannel shirt with his monotone nonchalant tone. Yeah I can't...and I won't..."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Did some shopping in the fashion mall and saw the sign for sushi and walked in. Greeted with a smile and had some really good sushi and sashimi. Nice big pieces and a lot of sashimi per serving( I'm used to the tiny sushi portions in NY so this was a good find. Highly recommended for sushi."}
{"text":"Ate here last night.   After having a fabulous dinner at Ra in San Diego, my wife and I took our daughter here for what we expected to be a terrific dining experience.  Our server took our order for appetizers and drinks and that was the last good or tmely action.  The calamari tempura appetizer was tasty and enough to share.  My daughter ordered edamame but got miso soup (we finally did get the edamame).  We ordered some sashimi (salmon and yellowtail).  Our server said the salmon was super fresh.  Neither appetizer looked or tasted fresh.  The yellowtail was mushy and swimming in wasabi sauce (again, out server told us it was not very spicy when we ordered).  The salmon was likewise, soft and mushy.  We had a lobster and shrimp roll that was mediocre and saturated in what seemed to be mayonnaise....yech!  We ordered a second round of drinks (one beer and two wines) which didn't come until we had finished the meal.  One order of sashimi never came and our server had to be reminded...he finally brought it when we were ready for our check.  During the evening, we had a difficult time finding our server....we finally asked another server to locate him.  This happened three times during the 90 minutes we were there.  My beer was served in the bottle with the label still partially wrapped around the neck (Stella Artois) instead of offering me a glass.  This was NOT the Ra experience we had in San Diego and we heartily recommend that you find a different sushi/sashimi restaurant when you're in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Happy Hour.....the best 3 hrs of the day!! RA's is great!! The Sushi is awesome!! The Viva Las Vegas Roll is my fav. that is Kani Kam and cream cheese that is tempura battered and topped with spicy tuna, crab and finished with spinach and a kick ass eel sauce!! Sit at the bar during happy hour and you can't help but be happy!! A ton of sushi and sake specials plus the bartenders are very cool! Try the seasme chicken wings too!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many RA locations and finally I found one that didn't make their drinks undrinkable strong.  I had something called a blushing geisha I believe and it was really good.  My friend Diana got the drink and I wanted to taste it too which I'm happy I tried it.  The food was also a little bit better, still a little bland but there was something about it that had more flavor.  I don't know if it was more spices, sauce, or what compared to their other locations but I liked this one the most out of the 3 locations I've been to."}
{"text":"I go to this location a lot because my friend Javi is a huge fan of this place.  He's obsessed with their food and drinks but I simply think they are just okay.  Sushi is one of my favorite foods and I've honestly had stuff better that popped in my mouth from Fry's grocery store.  At Ra it's just kind of boring and plain and their drinks are often strong.  I like strong cause it saves on money but not so strong I can barely drink it.  Plus there is way too many college students for my taste.  Drunken morons crawl around the place, loud and annoying.  I guess if I was still 21 that would be great and in fact when I was 21 it was.  But being older I'm just not into that seen and I try to get my friends to travel to other Ra locations if they really want to eat their food."}
{"text":"Ok the sushi here is really good. The edamame here was exquisite as well. Actually the entire experience was pretty fantastic although there was a little bit of a wait about 5 minutes or so but it wasn't a big deal. The hot sake was terrific, I would definitely suggest that if you're going to stop by. Everything was great about this place except for the lady server wasn't very timely tonight so she didn't get much of a tip. I had my guy hand the chef $20 cash when we were walking out. The food here is really worth trying if you're feeling patient..."}
{"text":"Back again! Calamari viva las Vegas roll, crunch I calamari roll and so much more. 4 of us sharing a meal after a long day. Service is great."}
{"text":"i LOVE this restaurant. i wish there was one in nebraska. lol try the BARA CHIRASHI BOWL. its to die for.. i loved how this restaurant is half outside. the only drawback..is its kind of expensive..id def go again tho"}
{"text":"Sushi is good but I don't feel it is worth the price. It seems to be more hype than worth. Happy hour items are limited and still expensive. Music is VERY loud. Even in the middle of the day. (Maybe I'm just old or I never cared to not be able to talk to my Friend while eating.) The food does taste good though. So, if you are looking for a place to think you're cool and eat over priced sushi, this place is for you."}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has this low rating. I come here every time I'm in town. Incredible!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Ate here twice in 1 trip to Vegas. Every roll we tried, we loved. Very cheap, and VERY good!"}
{"text":"We've been to RA Sushi in Vegas and California.  They have great sushi and other nice dishes.  It's a fun place to hang out and have dinner.  If you want some help ordering, go for the guest faves!  They even make yummy green beans and we also like the degaku tofu. I like the cucumber \"kimchee\".  It's not like real Korean kimchee but if you like cucumbers it's a nice refreshing side dish.  My family loves the chicken wings and the tacos in addition to their sushi and rolls."}
{"text":"Yellow Monkey Rolls = yum. I like to go for lunch just before I pick my kids up from school , mom's treat time."}
{"text":"The fish was of so-so quality, the rolls were on the smaller side and doused excessively with mayo based sauces. Great service and nice outdoor seating, nonetheless. Acceptable for a quick bite just don't expect a spectacular meal."}
{"text":"So I haven't been to a Ra in years, just because typically I have to drive 8 to 10 miles to get to one, when I have other options much closer. But for xmas this year I got several gift cards and said OK, so this Saturday around 10pm myself and my gf finally went.   The pluses:  We got Spring Rolls, Ra Ckin Shrimp, Seaweed Salad, California Roll, Rainbow Roll, Chili Ponzu Yellowtail Roll, Tootsie Maki Roll and a couple of Ice teas.   The food all came out fairly fast, there was not much of a wait, and everything was great tasting, I mean the food was pretty good, but I wouldn't say it was great, nothing to write  home about.   Our server Chelsea was great.  She was on top of our drinks and was very informative about any questions we had regarding rolls and making suggestions.   The minus:  The hostess, was a little rude, when I walked in she didn't even say hello, she just stared blankly at the screen in front of her, and then just bent down and handed me the little buzzer thing  and told me they would page me when something was available, I asked looking inside that there were quite a few seats and tables available. When I asked her about them, she said other people were waiting to be seated at those spots. I then asked about our wait time and she said maybe 10 to 15 minutes. I would have like to have been acknowledged when I arrived.   Ok...so we walked outside and went down the street to get a few samples of frozen yogurts. Before they could even finish making my espresso our buzzer went off. So we walked back in, less then 2 minutes wait, kind of upset that it took allot shorter then what we were told, I would of rather just stood and waited, then walking down the street and then coming back.   Once back inside the other seats I pointed at earlier were still empty in fact they remained empty our whole visit, we were seated in the back, next to a kitchen entrance, where I must of gotten bumped into about 5 or 6 times by staff members coming in and out of the kitchen. I did not make for a pleasurable dining experience. And between this and the hostess which is why this place only got three stars.   Overall, this was OK, but I have experienced allot better. Probably wont go back unless someone gives me another gift card, still prefer Zen/delux, Sushi brokers and Stingray over Ra."}
{"text":"Would have to say this location was a better experience then the location in old town, the hostess was attentive and nice, there was no wait and our server Taylor was polite and on point with drink refills and information.  Got the happy hour menu and the soft shell crab roll and a few other items and was please with almost everything at this location, it's also cleaner and the layout is set up significantly better in my opinion compared to the one in old-town."}
{"text":"This is a very nice bar and restaurant. We wanted to seat outside. It was very loud. Noices was coming all around the bar. We ordered a dark bear with chocolate. We really liked it. Also order some Tuna rolls. It is great."}
{"text":"I know its RA, and we've all been to at least one of their locations, but this location is pretty darned good. The staff is nice, the place is always tidy, drinks are mixed well, food comes out properly... the music is a TAD loud, but that's a RA thing. They tend to be pretty busy most days for happy hour, but we've always been able to at least get seats at the bar.  I think the service at the bar might be some of the best! I recommend the spicy yellowtail maki, shrimp tempura maki roll and red sangria sake ... Love that drink!"}
{"text":"Oh Ra..  You made us wait for just short of an hour for a table, but Ra, I still love you.    You asked us if we wanted to sit outside with rain covered tables and chairs and made a point to tell us if it started raining harder you would not be responsible for our food or drinks, but Ra, I still love you.    Our waiter just wasn't into our party, but Ra, I still love you.  I know I should just get out of the abusive relationship with Ra but the Food was tasty, beer was cold, sake was hot. What can I say, I am a sucker for love....."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. Great atmosphere but the sushi fell short especially con the prices. Most important part of sushi is freshness but that didn't happen."}
{"text":"First, we made reservations and arrived about 10 minutes early. They wouldn't seat us until our reserved time due to \"being busy\". I counted no less than 9 empty tables and about 15 seats at the bar. Read: not busy.  Second, we waited 20 minutes just for water. 45 minutes into our experience, we finally got the drinks we ordered 20 minutes ago. Mine is wrong.   Wish us luck, have to be at Gammage in 30 minutes!"}
{"text":"We couldn't get into Ocean Club, so we ended up at RA Sushi.  A very cool & chic ambiance.  Menu was good and looks like it's a fun place. However, I was very annoyed at the level of service.  We ordered 3 things...  and she forgot one of them.  I mean really?  I didn't make a big deal of it as we weren't in a hurry.  Would we go back?  Only if we couldn't get a table at the Ocean Club."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I may be a bit biased since my friends and I met one of the bartenders who invited us to visit.  RA is definitely more of a fusion style sushi bar with it's hybrid rolls.  As a result you most definitely have to try the Viva Las Vegas Roll.  It's ingredients may sound peculiar, but again whoever invented this roll has pulled it off!  Our new found friend was quick to recommend numerous drinks but the sake sangria she prepared was absolutely delightful on a hot Vegas day.  The atmosphere is nice and airy and is great for just relaxing at the bar and people watching.  As with anything else on the strip, it's all within stumbling distance of where ever you may be staying."}
{"text":"Pretty standard. Not bad. Not remarkable. Great service though. I did have a Monkey Roll and was pretty impressed.  It had mango on it and a tangy sauce on the side.  Pretty much unlike any sushi I've had before. So they get points for originality there. But what's odd is they were charging $4 for a small bowl of miso."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here at Ra on Ray 2/18/13 with a co worker. The place was not that busy at all (I can see why) We were not greeted by a server for at least 15 minutes. Then a bus boy walks by and we asked him if we had a server (it was supposed to be Nichole)  Then a manager comes by and sees us looking at our watches and all around for \"Nichole\" I see a blonde servers back to us a few times (Nichole) never even looks over at us. The manager takes our food order back to the kitchen. Nichole makes an appearance and before I can ask for a drink she swirls away. We ask the server from another area if we can order our beverages from her, so she takes our drink order. Finally my salmon carpaccio comes, luke warm, and the sauce is NOT the correct taste too much wasabi-mayo.... not even close to Mesa or Scottsdales carpaccio... my co worker gets her miso soup and is not even finished when \"Nichole\" walks up grabs the bowl and says \"are you finished?\" my friend doesn't like people touching her food while she is still eating... so she tells her to go ahead and take it. It has been 35 minutes now... NO drinks, and the rest of our lunch nowhere to be found.... So we just walked out... LOUSY food LOUSY service or rather \"NO\" service unbelievable   I was so shocked because I have never had a bad experience at the other Ra's     PS.... the portions were so small they might as well use smaller plates now :("}
{"text":"RA's the place you visit if you're going out in Old Town and want to have dinner and drinks at a sceney place before you do. RA's the place you visit if you want a good deal on happy hour. RA is pretty consistent in everything they produce. Nothing is spectacular, but everything is decent.   Whenever I visit RA, it's crowded with people and the scene is lively. Between the sushi and the other food, everything is pretty run of the mill good here. I've had the chicken teriyaki which has a nice zing to it and is a nice meal option if I don't feel like sushi. The sushi here is pretty spot-on as well. They make the sushi fresh at the sushi counter and I've never had a bad roll here. They have everything from Caterpillar and Las Vegas rolls, to California and shrimp tempura rolls.   RAs happy hour is great. The drinks and food are very reasonably priced and their Sunday happy hour is awesome too.   The location is nice since it's right in the heart of Old Town and like I said, it's a great spot to get some food in the system before the night gets started."}
{"text":"Went here on a recommendation from a good friend while on a business trip. I was having a hard time deciding what to get so I turned to the bartender(Johanna) for advice. After hearing what kind of food I was thinking about, she recommended getting the ceviche and she could get it put on a bed of lettuce so it made a big salad. It was AMAZING! So fresh and great flavor! Only needed the lime wedges that came with it as dressing(as Johanna recommended). Paired with a Kim Crawford Sauv Blanc, it was a great meal. Atmosphere in here was fun too. Great service, great food, great ambiance. I will definitely be coming back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place. We come at least 3/4 times a week to eat or dinner here.  Their food is amazing and all the people that work in here are polite and really nice.  They are really fast at serving your food and always looking if you need something else.  We just love this location that's why we come to this one even if it's far from our house.  The atmosphere is perfect . Our service dog loves all the waitresses here coz they are nice and bring him water.   We recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"This place puts out some good eats! I was a little skeptical having sushi in Arizona, but apparently fresh fish makes the plane daily.   The Line Up:  -Lobster Spring Rolls: AMAZING appetizer! If I had any room left, I would have ordered these for dessert too! I liked the sauce it came with.  -Rainbow Roll with all Salmon: Yum! Surprisingly fresh.  -Tropical Roll: This is what summer tastes like! Very fresh, sweet and delicious.  -Viva Las Vegas Roll (x2): Winner, Winner!! We ordered one and had to immediately order another. This rolls stole the show. We have a RA Sushi in San Diego and I plan on dining there specifically for this roll!! And the Lobster Spring Roll.   I was pleasantly surprised with Zonie Sushi. Coming from the coast, I tent to be a snob when it comes to freshness, but this place delivers.   My only gripe was the value. The bill was high for what we got. The rolls were small, I was expecting the check to match. The sushi was fresh and tasty though... and service was on point!"}
{"text":"i can't possibly give this place more than three stars simply on principle.  sure i'm a non-fish-eating-vegetarian, but still, serving raw fish in the desert? ick.  the happy hour deals are great, so great they left me with little memory of the food i'd ordered. the bits and pieces i do remember are average veggie tempura, and a super tasty beef-roll-made-vegetarian recommended by the waitress. i'd likely return for the casual happy hour, though avoid drowning myself in cheap sake."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food very attentive servers. Music is great.  The location is right off the freeway and in dana park. Come over and enjoy"}
{"text":"Decided to head to RA instead of our normal sushi spot only because we didn't want to get another Uber to Old Town. While the food is ok, it just lacks what RA use to represent....It really feels like a chain sushi spot now as in the past it didn't. Seems like the past few years it has lost it's spark. While my sushi was good the portions have really shrunk in size. My boyfriend had the Crazy Monkey Roll and I had a Spicy Salmon Handroll and Sweet Shrimp w/heads. The handroll was two bites so I was very disappointed to say the least. Usually while this is a perfect amount for me I left still hungry.   As you see I don't give a ton of 2 star reviews but I just couldn't give it 3 or higher as it's just lost the connection to people/guests and the food had slipped. Kinda sad as it use to be one of my favorite sushi spots to head to and I just don't see myself going there anytime in the near future."}
{"text":"Always a go to sushi spot on Mill for a good sushi lunch. They have pretty good lunch specials and the food is always consistant whenever I go. I had the veggie tempura lunch special this time (I usually always get the sashimi special) and then a new hand roll that they have now. Very good and I always get to much food!   Service was good, fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We met some friends from out of town at RA. It was recommended by the concierge at their hotel and was our first time. The dining room was nicely decorated. Our server was friendly and helpful. Service was on point and the wait time was acceptable. We were there during happy hour and a number of food and drink specials are available.  The following items were ordered to share among four people. All items were tasty and the portions plentiful. Shishito Peppers, Garlic Citrus Yellowtail, Crispy Onion Albacore, Viva Las Vegas Roll and Chicken Katsu. The Chicken Katsu was an exceptionally large portion."}
{"text":"Nice elegant place. They make it pretty dark inside like a lounge. They have DJs also. Happy hour is good. $1 sakes! Sushi is good, some other plates they have aren't as great. Still a good deal"}
{"text":"Always good for reverse Happy Hour, good prices and good atmosphere. I usually get the Zonie Roll and Las Vegas rolls."}
{"text":"Sat for 15 minutes and nobody came to ever get drinks or anything nobody ever acknowledged us. Sick service, If you want to waste your time come here."}
{"text":"Wow!  My wife has gone here  a few times with her girlfriends and I started to get jealous about how they talked about the sushi.  Now I see why!  We decided to take advantage of the happy hour during our anniversary and we were not disappointed!  Here is what we ordered for appetizers:  - Grilled Short Ribs - Kaisen Ceviche  For sushi we ordered: - Viva Las Vegas Roll - Crunchy Calamari Roll - Crazy Monkey Roll - \"RA\"ckin' Roll  The \"RA\"ckin' Roll and Crunchy Calamari are my absolute favorites!  I will do anything to come back and eat those again.  The Grilled Short Ribs quenched my dark passenger's need for seared cow meat.  Delicious!  Even though it was happy hour, service was great and the ambiance was fine.  Dark, intimate and comfortable.  They were playing 80's music as well... AWESOME!  I haven't seen this at many other restaurants, but if ANY server notices that your drink is low, they go ahead and fill it.  Even if you don't belong to them. A+ Service here. I am definitely going to come back here."}
{"text":"It's your typical chain sushi restaurant. You know what to expect and the standard of service.  I usually will inky come during happy hour... bc, why not? I enjoy what's on the menu and the prices are good. We can clean up between $60-70 on drinks, 4 rolls, potstickers, and 2 orders of the chicken skewers. That's a lot of food!! I also love their shashido peppers. They're SO good!!!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite sushi joint by any means but it sure is conveniently located (Fashion Show Mall).  It is a bit over-priced and the quality could be better... but I do enjoy the happy hour specials.  In fact, it's probably the only time I would visit.  Had the standard rolls (Spicy Tuna/ Shrimp) and hot sake - mediocre really but I guess that's what you get w/ cheap sake ($3ish).    Sat at the bar and could barely hear myself think.  I wouldn't recommend sitting at the bar unless you're ok with lots of yelling."}
{"text":"first happy hour since we arrived back to scottsdale and this place still has one of the best. the sushi and sake are well priced, but still....what's up with the freaking music!!! it's like a club in there, so loud. and when did the waitresses start dressing like skanky school girls? they're nice to look at, but it gives the place a kind of, i don't know, colleg-ish bar feel?"}
{"text":"I loved Ra. Happy hour is cheap and the servers are nice. I even brought my manager and coworkers here twice. They loved the food. I loved the food. We were happy to pay our +$$ bill.  Why did I give this place two stars?  Ra over serves alcohol to its customers at the bar area. They should put a warning on the door. \"If you're a girl, drunk ---holes will make your stay extremely uncomfortable.\" If you're on a date, just avoid the bar/outside area at night.  I brought a lady friend to this restaurant because we wanted sushi around midnight. The dining area was closed so we had to sit in the bar. That's fine. The weather was really nice that night. We sit down and luckily the three guys next to us were tipsy/drunk. And one guy touched my friend's shoulder as a prank. Ughhh. He was making faces at her the entire time during our stay.  He was clearly not sober. The bartender should have kicked him out. Even a child can tell that something was wrong with this guy. Unfortunately, Ra values alcohol profits and tips over safety.  When we were walking back to our car, someone puked sushi+alcohol in the elevator of the parking garage. Thank you Ra for the best night ever."}
{"text":"I am a delivery driver.  Today I thought I would post this review since the restaurant is very dead, less than half full and I have been waiting here for 15 minutes and my two sushi orders have not been made yet.  This is horrible, and I go through this every time I try to pick up from this location.  Not even an apology from the staff or manager.  Never picking up an order from here again on all platforms I deliver on.  I would suggest not ordering from here either unless you want your food 3 hours late."}
{"text":"Food was delicious! Restroom was horrible! Smelled like an animal died in there. I ordered extra food but after going to restroom not sure I can eat it after my restroom experience."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than $15 each (including a 20% tip) for 5 cheap women! We ate tapas style...several appetizers and sushi's...and were happy with everything we ordered. Portions were on the smaller side (except for the tempura), so we ended up getting an add'l item, but everything was tasty. Service was good. The place definitely feels a tad chainy, but I'd go back..."}
{"text":"Come if you feel like you want to Dine in the middle of a night club!  The Music was LOUD, but it was cool music and that made it okay.  The happy hour specials were great both for drinks and food. I really liked that they had both raw sushi items and cooked bar food items on the happy hour specials.  We ordered the Sashimi plate for dinner and it was a great size, 16 pieces, with good quality fish.  Our server messed up a few times on our order, he was very cool/hip while he corrected his messes. So if your order doesn't arrive quickly, make sure to double check they got it. As I said it was LOUD in there.  Party On!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit and watch the magic happen with the rolls. Tried all the fruity drinks. Great! The place doesn't get a 5 star  because of its lack of attention to detail. Chairs a little sticky and lopsided. I noticed some residue on the glasses and sent back a plate that was smeared with something. They try hard but seems like they could be lacking on some experienced management."}
{"text":"The service I had from Adam was amazing yesterday. We were greeted 7 minutes after being sat. A tad long but Adams personality made me forget about that. He started with suggesting items and drinks for us. I told him I don't eat meat and the options came spewing out of his mouth. Man was he knowledgeable.  I ended up getting an avocado roll, cucumber roll and some pineapple and cheese wontons. Really hard to believe those are made in house. The wontons were so crispy it broke when I ate it and had barely any cheese inside. The sauce was fantastic. Sucks when you have an amazing sauce but nothing good to dip in it.  The avocado rolls and cucumber rolls were as you expect. Avocado and rice and cucumbers with rice. Nothing memorable but nothing bad. It was just...good. When I go to places on the strip I expected to be wowed. I have been wowed with sushi before so it's possible.  This place is good for happy hour but I wouldn't come back for anything else. I also fear they don't have other servers like Adam. So chances of me getting a server that blows me away....not looking hot. That speaks volumes for his service.  Passion fruit margarita was good. A 9$ margarita made with patron silver (I believe) doesn't really seem like a happy hour steal but still a very well crafted margarita. I literally couldn't drink it through a straw because the chunks of passion fruit kept clogging the straw so I just drank it without one even though that's not my favorite way of drinking my margarita.  Thanks Adam for great service and thank you bartender for the good margarita!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this place and it had been a few years since my last visit. My husband and I decided to come for happy hour and sit on the patio with a sushi roll, glass of wine and people watch. We ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll- not my favorite. The Tootsy Maki was my favorite- glad the waitress recommended it. We also ordered a fried rice ball with raw fish on top- no thank you- skip that and order a roll instead.  We were both a little disappointed in our experience this time. It wasn't as good as we remembered it. They do have a great patio in the Fashion show mall and it's still a nice place to come order a drink - they have a good wine list:)"}
{"text":"Been coming to this spot for years and have generally had decent experiences. This Ra location in particular has had its ups and downs throughout the years, but nothing ever so bad that I didn't want to go back. But what happened to my husband and I on Saturday was terrible and we won't be back. I had a sushi snack craving and so ordered one roll through Yelp/GrubHub for pickup and paid at the time of ordering. The order was confirmed and the estimated pickup time was 45-55 minutes, which is nuts, but ok. Eventually, the pickup time was changed to a specific time. My husband arrived at that time, only to find that the order was not ready and the hostess had no idea what he was talking about. So, my husband gave her my order number and showed her the email confirmation. She said their GrubHub tablet wasn't working and my husband asked to speak to a manager. The manager came out and said something along the lines of, \"Oh, just one roll? That'll take like 10 minutes.\" (Cue eye roll.) The manager then suggested that my husband call GrubHub. And he leaves. As my husband is on the phone, the hostess comes back to tell him that the order finally went through. When my husband gets the roll 10 minutes after that, he asks to speak to the manager again. The manager comes back, smelling like cigarette smoke, and my husband explains the entire situation. The manager said it was their Yelp tablets that weren't working but once they rebooted them the order went through. But no apologies for the delay. No questions about how they could make it up to us. No acceptance of responsibility for the delay. One hour and twenty minutes after ordering, my husband got that one roll. And the roll wasn't the quality we have had in the past; definitely not worth the wait and frustration."}
{"text":"The lunch specials here are tremendous.  I had a salmon bowl full of delicious fish that came with miso soup and only cost $8.50.  I can't emphasize how much salmon was in this bowl.  My wife had a delicious shrimp tempura bento box for the same amount.  The dinner prices were certainly higher, but for lunch (11-3) this place is a great choice."}
{"text":"Daughter and I went here one night last week while in town for spring break/spring training, for a \"girls' night\".  Friends of ours staying at the same hotel had told us about Ra's happy hour, with fabulous prices on food and drinks from 3-7pm weekdays. We got there at about 6:15, and it was packed with a wait, but we were seated within 5 minutes or so. Not bad at all!  The food was delicious! Loved the Las Vegas roll and the Rainbow roll the best of what we tried. Didn't like the spicy salmon roll so much - would have preferred the spicy tuna roll but it wasn't on happy hour special... should have just gotten it anyway- great prices!  Also loud, fun, hip atmosphere.  We will go back on our next trip for sure!!"}
{"text":"I am a big sushi fan but very picky.  I ordered take out sashimi & sushi.  The sushi bar was very clean.  The sashimi was so fresh it melted in my mouth.  The Rainbow roll was outstanding.  While waiting for my order I had a drink at the bar.  Bartender was very friendly.  Price was right for both food & drinks.  I wish I lived closer (I live in San Diego) because if I did, this would be a regular place for me."}
{"text":"Good service, fun selection of sushi. Always a decent late night crowd despite the sleepy Mesa/Gilbert location. There's a large menu and we always try something new."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere! Great happy hour menu! The vibe in here is very cool, and very entertaining. I brought a few friends here for happy hour. They all had a blast! Very likely we will be visiting this place again in the near future!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, aaron genuinely cared about my food allergies and was a pleasure. The sush was killer"}
{"text":"I'm still here in the restaurant to write this review. This place SUCKS service is lacking and food I've had better. My serve Kalani forgot everything maybe it's time for a Career change."}
{"text":"In terms of sushi, this place gets a solid \"meh\". Their lunch specials are decent and won't break the bank, but the quality of the actual food left me underwhelmed. Service and ambiance get most of the points here - plus their happy hour specials are pretty damn good.  I've given this place several tries too - and honestly I'll probably continue to keep coming back considering the lack of sushi joints within the Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place. It has become a tradition to come here on a Saturday every time we are in Vegas. The Happy Hour is great and is really hard to miss as it runs from 3-7pm. We always leave this place full (happy hour menu) and drunk (sake is only $2). I recommend you try it and let me know."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had in my entire life. We got the pork gyoza, viva Las Vegas roll, gojira roll & shrimp chile roll (not sure on the last one). It was amazing. The service was so friendly and kept us with everything we needed."}
{"text":"Shaunte is the BEST server. Food was fresh. She kept the food coming and the drinks pouring!!! Request her when you come to eat here! Great place !'n"}
{"text":"The sushi is alright. Service was terrible and annoying and the music is to loud. I was trying to count the number of douche bags and annoying chicks but I legitimately can not count that high. You will wait forever to be seated and ignored if you do not buy alcohol. There are 10 other places I will go to before i go to any Ra resturant."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a business lunch, ordering my usual sashimi combo that assures me of a basic meal that I can use to judge between venues.  Since Ra appears more as a trendy place rather than traditional, I had my reservations.  But the sashimi was excellent-fresh, decently portioned and well presented.  Along with the slightly bland miso soup, I was happy with the meal.  But when I got to the desert menu, I found a surprise: Coconut Creme Brûlée.  It was amazing!  Creamy, rich, delicious, I could have had more, but knowing how many eggs are used to make creme brûlée, I held off.  A solid 3 stars for the meal, but the extra star is for the desert.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ra isn't the biz. Everything is all hyped up and overdone. And nothing stands to par. We had a couple of the items in the happy hour special. I'm glad they were half price cause had I had to pay full price for any of it I would've been maaad. I eat a lot of sushi, maybe I should start writting more reviews because all the places I've been to deserve way more cred than this place is getting. The portions were small, the service was bad. I asked for things like three times, cups for the beer, they gave us two cups for the sake when we clearly had a party of three, sauces were missing, etc. Our waiter seemed to be occupied with a thousand things at once and every time we waved him down he'd give us like half a glance. Yeah I wish I could say the sake special made it all worth it but that would be a lie as well. The sake container was so tiny it gave us roughly two full cups per serving at $2 a pop. Not a great value. It was passable food, but with the portion sizes and the bad service I'd advice anyone to skip Ra and hit up the Mikey D's down the block 50 piece McNugget for 10 dorrah say whaaaa..."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good sushi and a perfect way to kick off an evening on the town.  Ra is fun with groups, big or small.  Also, a good date spot if you don't mind how loud it is, even with the attractive waitstaff.  Worth a short wait, just grab a drink and check out all of the new colagen and botox.  It can be quite entertaining."}
{"text":"Always a must stop for me whenever we're in Vegas.  The best time to come is during Happy Hour.  Food and drinks range from $2-$10.  They also have a lunch special.  It was some kind of sushi bowl, I forgot the name but it's BOMB.COM! =D  I really love their ceviche here, I always get it.  Did I mention the $2 Sake?"}
{"text":"Love the layout and the location.  Happy hour was great, service was great.  We will definitely return.  Clean restaurant and sushi was delicious!"}
{"text":"This place has awful service.  Awful, horrible, terrible service.  Every. Single. Time. We sit at a table or booth it takes 15-45 minutes between plates.  We still go because it's cheap and pretty good when you do get your order. We have found that sitting at the sushi bar  helps in getting your order all together."}
{"text":"I'm a happy hour troll... I never go there otherwise but get a bunch of rolls half off and some beers.. can't complain a bit."}
{"text":"Me and hubby had lunch here today.  There was 1 waitress running the bar and half the restaurant which decreased her attentiveness to us. I understand being short staffed on days so this could have been why.  My biggest complaint and most important of all in any restaurant was the food quality. We ordered The lobster sushi roll and the ultimate shrimp tempura roll and the beef terriyaki lunch. This also came with salads and miso soup. Everything we had tasted old, pre-made and just not fresh at all. Our salads looked and tasted pre-made, the lettuce was wilted on all three. Our sushi rolls were below par. Like I said nothing seemed fresh! It all looked and tasted like it was pre-made or made from cheap ingredients to save the restaurant money. Even my \"seared\" ahi tuna looked like the seared part was either done the day before and just thrown in a container for the sushi chefs to use or seared in the microwave. Our \"beef\" was just nasty completely.. This has to be frozen meat they buy in bulk, just awful. My hubby and I do have a favorite sushi place that we visit 3-4 times a month. The reason why it's our favorite isn't because of fast service or a pleasant waitress... It's because of the top quality FRESH always perfect food. That's what keeps customers coming back... Make them dream of your food!!! Hopefully RA can grasp how crucial this is for their restaurant."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is great 1/2 off of appetizers and rolls.  Had lunch here the other day, sat at the Sushi Bar and Moon the sushi chef was really cool.  Made great sushi and great recommendations.  He warned me about certain things not having real crab meat and that was great.  I prefer real crab meat on certain things.  The Vegas Roll and Hamachi was Excellent, the amaebi was very fresh.  Can't go wrong with Ra Sushi.  The service is great and has a great view of the strip if you sit outside."}
{"text":"The music is too loud, the sushi overpriced, and of uninspiring quality.  I'm not sure what the draw is here.  I could understand if it was the best option for sushi, but it's not.  If you are happy with spending money on \"okay\", then come here.    ...This is the vaguest review I've written.  I can't think of anything concrete to say about Ra - good or bad.  It is \"meh\" in every sense."}
{"text":"This is a great sushi place to go to if you are in the area. The staff were very friendly. I wouldn't say the sushi was the best I've ever had in my life, but it was still pretty darn good. I could tell that my salmon nigiri was made from the fatty part of the salmon. It's not a big deal, but it makes a difference to a sushi lover like me. Overall I enjoyed this resturant and I would go back again if I was hungering sushi in vegas!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. We ordered 5 different rolls and tempura shrimp. Great loud atmosphere in the restaurant and would come back if we had a different server. We had a guy named Tyler and the service was horrible. He is the only reason for the 2 stars. He got our order wrong, didn't bring soy sauce to the table, (had to ask twice) and didn't clear the table as we finished each item leaving a total mess. My advice...sit at the bar."}
{"text":"Not a place to go if you enjoy and expect good sushi. All of our rolls were 95% rice with the smallest amount of mediocre fish. They rename basic rolls to seem like \"speciality\" rolls and charge 3X the amount they should be. Example - their Tootsy Maki roll is crab, cucumber and shrimp with a sweet sauce on top (basically a California roll substituting avocado with an unnoticeable amount of shrimp and throwing some teriyaki sauce on top) and they charge $8.7 for it... double the price of a typical Cali roll. Their Las Vegas roll was a rice roll with spicy imitation crab mix on top for $14. This is the same for several of their rolls. We were so disappointed. Don't ignore the 3-star yelp rating they have.... it's for a reason."}
{"text":"We are visiting from Los Angeles. The food was a bit spicy for me and the manager Isaac was incredibly accommodating. He Changed my meal and then comped it.. He even comped me a birthday dessert! The over all service was excellent. Had a nice birthday lunch."}
{"text":"I like Ra for their Happy Hour. It has a fun atmosphere and is a good place to go with a group. Almost all sushi, appetizers  and drinks are 50% off so you can eat a and drink for a reasonable price. I loved their Blushing Geisha cocktail! It's tart and sweet and goes down oh so easy. We started out with the tootsy maki , shrimp tempura, and Las Vegas roll. The shrimp tempura and tootsy maki were very yummy. Everyone at my table raved about the Las Vegas roll, which was okay, but I preferred the tootsy maki. We also ordered the lobster spring rolls which I didn't care for. They were pretty bland and I wouldn't have guessed it was lobster if lobster wasn't in the name. Overall, I would recommend Ra to people looking for a fun Happy Hour at a great price."}
{"text":"We were here for reverse happy hour and had a pretty good time.  We got a round of sake-bombers and a couple of rolls, the service was friendly and the bartender was beautiful.  I ended up having to apologize for my friend, a number of times, so we left before we wanted to for fear of getting kicked out.  I'd go back and try a real meal there at some point, but only during regular or reverse HH due to the drink prices.  It's tough for me, when it comes to sushi, as I'm a transplant here from Seattle - and it just doesn't get much fresher than that.  Three stars for adequate ambiance and tasty sake."}
{"text":"What a slow place. I came here for lunch with my friends and it too them more then 45 mins for the food. I eventually had to take it to-go. If you are on a clock don't even bother getting here! Didn't taste the food but my friends told the sushi is made of frozen food. So stale food, slow place. Never coming here again!!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun.  I know a lot of people complain about how the music is so loud and stuff but i think that's what makes it feel like a night out/dinner.  I love going here with my girlfriends before we go out or eve on a Monday night when we just need to grab a bite and a beer.  As far as consistency goes it gets and A+...even for take out.  I've called and made numerous takeout orders and i'm never disappointed (i'm not gonna say it's as good as eating there-cuz i don't think you can say that about anywhere, but for sushi-it's as good as it gets). Overall this place is great for meeting up with friends, ordering some unique sushi creations and having a drink."}
{"text":"Would give 6 stars if possible! Great service, friendly staff, and AMAZING SUSHI!!!! Came here with the wife for her birthday. Desert comp'd. Will come here again and again. We finally found our AZ sushi heaven."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The service is horrible. The hostess this evening (Feb 11) was horrible: rude and detached. The Manager was worse. Do not patronize this restaurant unless you have money to burn and time to kill."}
{"text":"Couldn't get an answer on where the salmon was from and if it was sustainably harvested. Otherwise what I had was good."}
{"text":"This is absolutely one of my favorite places to go! Their happy hour has great choices! I love their rolls and dessert. Their cinnamon tempura is amazing. Their service is awesome. Waiters were very friendly and always recommended the most tasting appetizers, course meals, and desserts. The place itself is beautiful and different. Also, signing up for them is a good idea. You get special offers and birthday gifts from them! The manager, I don't know his name, but he is very kind and sweet to his customers. Always making them feel welcome!"}
{"text":"Poor service! I ordered a vegetable gyoza to start and it took a good 20 minutes to get it. I made sure to emphasize I want the vegetable gyoza NOT the pork gyoza since I'm a vegetarian. She said ok. After the long wait she brought it out and it was a pork gyoza. I tried to get the attention of the staff. I waved, called out, and several just looked at me and walked by. I had to almost yell at a waitress passing by for them to finally acknowledge me. I explained the gyoza is wrong. She said this is not her table and was going to leave, I stopped her and said to please get my server then. She said ok and we kept waiting for another 10 minutes and no one showed up. I got the attention of a manager and finally my server came over. She said to me: you can eat that one and she can order another vegetable gyoza. What part of vegetarian don't you get?! At the end my friend and I all finished our sushi rolls, but still no gyoza. I called the manager over, and he said they are working on it. We didn't want to wait anymore and canceled the order. Never even apologized for brining me the wrong food! The rolls are good though."}
{"text":"Woo RA!  I'm starting to get a good feel for sushi lately.  I like this RA; always busy and makes me feel like I'm somebody important when I get a seat.  This was actually the first RA Sushi I attended when I first appeared into the scene.  I appreciate their consistancy here - it is what it is....Service - they seem to always be on top of it.  Granted maybe it's the alcohol talking - everythings moving a little quicker than me :)  The appearance hasn't changed much, but I can't complain; red balls hanging from the ceiling makes me want more sushi ... right? Or should I try to kick it?  Drink specials are a must here so attend happy hour when possible and enjoy my friends!"}
{"text":"I. Love. It. Here. Absolute favorite place. Good cocktails, fresh sushi, great service. What more can you ask for"}
{"text":"This was the only shitty part of my otherwise excellent trip to Vegas. It was a rather cold night, and there was close to a 45 minute wait for a table inside, so my friend and I elected to sit outside on the heated patio.  It took 20 minutes (no exaggerating) before someone even came and took our order. She apologized and said the waiters were getting slammed and she came over to help out (we later found out that she was the bartender, and when she saw us not getting served, came out). She was the one bright spot in this shitty shitty experience.  Our actual waiter came out 5 minutes later (25 minutes on the game clock for those following) to take our order. Too late, buddy! A third waiter then brought us water.  Another 20 minutes went by (45 minutes now) and all of my sushi had come out, but my friend's chicken teriyaki hadn't arrived yet. I flagged down the lazy waiter and rather sternly asked him to track the dish down. It came out another 10 minutes later (55 min) without so much as an apology.   The menu itself has more rolls with cream cheese on it than any self-respecting sushi place would allow. I got two of the few that didn't and a couple pieces of nigiri, totaling about $40. I ate $40 worth of grocery store grade sushi. And not a good, Asian grocery store, I'm talking about sushi from Ralph's or Safeway. It was terrible.  We ended up not tipping the rest of the wait staff at all for their shitty service, but gave the bartender a fat wad of cash and told her not to share."}
{"text":"Okay...I'm gonna keep saying this until you get it in your head!  You looking for sushi?  Why are you coming here??  Yes, I know it says RA \"Sushi\" - it also says \"Bar\" -- come for the drinks and atmosphere.  Really the sushi is not gonna blow any minds anytime soon.  Their reverse happy hour is always a delight since prices drop and the drinks keep flowing :)  Stay thirsty my friends!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of this Ra location, the one in Old Town Scottsdale is infinitely better.  I've only been here twice but on our last visit there were several things that sucked.  First, we sat at the bar and it took literally 15 minutes for the bartender to ask if we'd like to order something.  The place was hardly full, she was just too engrossed in a conversation with her coworkers to notice us pointedly staring at her.    When the food arrived, I was again disappointed as the sushi on top of my rainbow roll was all lukewarm.  Sorry but that's just disgusting.  My friend had it worse though, she had to send her spicy tuna roll back as there was a hair in it.  Not my hair, or her hair, another person's hair.  To their credit, they did bring out another roll, but by that point we were done with the experience.  It was so bad, I didn't even order a 2nd drink - and it was happy hour!"}
{"text":"We had a terrible experience recently at RA.  Our mistake was dining on a Friday evening because the music was blasting so loudly we couldn't even talk to each other, so we asked to move outside.  It was 100 degrees and hot but more than that we had terrible service.  I don't understand the music being so loud that you can even speak to one another at your table?  We weren't the only table outside but it sure felt like it, as we were largely forgotten.  Our drinks were rarely refilled, we both ordered raspberry or strawberry lemonades and never received a refill!  Not one.  Our water was only filled twice.  We had to ask twice for silverware!  My husbands steak dish was over cooked and he wanted to order rice but the server never checked on us after that point, and we also ordered 3 sushi rolls but never received wasabi or soy sauce and the PONZU YELLOWTAIL ROLL was missing the chili sauce.  I asked for sauce and it never came.  Our server was defensive and dismissive.  A manager did come by to ask how our meal was and when we started to tell him he apologized and gave us a free appetizer for our next visit.  I honestly don't think a measly free appetizer will entice us to come back after we spent over $70.00 on a poorly prepared meal and had terrible service."}
{"text":"No, thank you, but no. Here's the short of it: the sushi took FOREVER and it came out mushy, falling apart and zero flavor.   We sat at the bar hoping to just grab a couple of rolls and a drink before heading out for the night. It was definitely crowded so we were lucky to find two seats together. This is the hang out for the young Elite Scottsdale douche and his girl, so lots of 30,000 dollar millionaires.   He ordered a safe Captain and Coke and I made the mistake of ordering a dirty Absolut martini. It was awful, it was weird tasting, I can't even accurately describe it. I drank it so it would go away. I obviously did not have another.  So our food finally comes out. We ordered a shrimp tempura roll and a spicy tuna roll. They were HUGE. I hate that, how the hell am I supposed to eat this? The chop sticks could hardly even hold the weight and size of the thing. So I pick it up... it falls apart. So that answers the \"how do I eat this thing\" question. The answer is: AWKWARDLY.   Blah blah, I could say more but in the end, it's just not worth it to come here. The food sucks, the drinks suck, the atmosphere sucks."}
{"text":"This place completely underwhelms me.   At first glance, the decor seems cool, but then you sit down in a booth and sink four inches in the impression made from the hundreds of other asses that sat there. Not a pleasant thought. After that, you look around and realize that it's just an Asian version of Applebees or some other chain.   The service comes from a totally mediocre cute college girl with the personality of a tea cup. Adequate and boring, never really there but nothing you can truly fault her for.  The menu is absurd. It's huge and broken down into what seems like six unintelligible sections. Some of the sushi rolls are explained on the back, and inexplicably, some aren't. A lot of them have cream cheese, which in my opinion, is nasty.      Ive been here twice and both times I said I wouldn't come back, and yet I keep returning. I guess because it's easy and it's there. Between the dining area and the bar, definitely sit at the bar. At least the bartenders are fun to watch while they tweak out on whatever uppers they're on."}
{"text":"I show up on a Thursday night around 10:15pm for reverse happy hour and I'm very excited to use my $20 half birthday certificate. This isn't my first visit to Ra Sushi, but it is my first time at the Tempe location on Mill Ave. The place is busy, and the music is loud. The pretty hostess quickly seated me at the Sushi bar, as per my request, and said my server (Monique) would be with me shortly. The man behind the sushi bar was very friendly and asked me if I needed a paper order menu. I asked for one and he told another staff member walking away if he wouldn't mind bringing one for me while I wait. The order menu never came, but Monique eventually did. She informed me that my $20 certificate was not valid on happy hour prices (since when?) and that I would pay full price (so much for waiting for reverse happy hour). I was ok with that considering the restaurant doesn't have to do anything for me and I am still very grateful for the certificate. I order 1 Viva Las Vegas Roll, 1 Crunchy Calamari Roll, and 1 Smoked Salmon Nigiri with a water. About 10 minutes go by and the sushi chef hands me my order over the counter. The Las Vegas roll was phenomenal, absolutely delicious and very filling; I highly recommend. My crunchy calamari roll was very good, and the sweet eel sauce is a nice touch. The calamari prawns on the last two pieces were huge, and very tasty. Now onto the nigiri, a personal favorite. I saved this dish for last because I want a clean palette, lots of wasabi, and two nigiri pieces to finish with. Boy was I disappointed! The Salmon was super salty, even without Soy sauce. These two small pieces of fish alone go for almost half the price of a regular roll, so I was expecting great things. I ate both, as not to waste, but dang it was saltier than Lay's potato chips and I'm not exaggerating. I don't know where my server went during this entire time, but I'm in need of another glass of water and Monique is nowhere to be found. I've eaten two rolls, and some nigiri on one glass of water! Not once did she come over to check on refills, ask if the food was good, offer to sell me more, etc. She was totally focused on other parties and because I was alone and already started eating, I got thrown on the backburner. After sitting at the sushi bar for sometime waiting for my bill, and a refill, another staff member walks by and offers to refill my glass. I thank her, and start to wonder where MY server went. Another 10 min. go by and I still need my bill. It's a little after 11pm and I want to leave. Finally my server brings my bill after flagging her down and she clears the dirty dishes I've had to stare at for some time. I still left a 15% tip on what the bill WOULD have cost if my certificate was not applied. I've worked in the food industry and I didn't like it and my heart goes out to those who work it so I cut her a break considering she never actually waited me. On my way out I ask for a toothpick- they don't have any. I said ok, how about a piece of candy for my fish breath? Nothing. I left full, but empty handed. Oh well."}
{"text":"I went there for the 1/2 price happy hour, and becamse satisfied after my 5th order of rolls. Their portions were so small, and the ambiance was pretty cool... a little too Americanized cool for my taste though. I am the type of person that doesn't go out much for sushi because my dad makes it at home at a much better quality and freshness. So for me to go to a sushi bar means either (1) I am REALLY craving sushi, (2) other people around me are craving it, or (3) the ambiance is really hot.   Well... I think 2 out of 3 apply in this case, however I can't say the sushi was by any means high quality. The rice wasn't made well and it is just about a little better than your typical buffett made sushi.   Well... since the happy hour prices were awesome, I can't complain much (the party of 8 frat boy gringos next to my table certainly seemed to love their \"cultured\" sushi experience)  okay... let me break it down my take on the restaurant....  Sushi Quality: 2 stars Ambiance: 4 stars, if you are looking for a posh thing. But if you want traditional, 2 stars is more like it.  Service: 3 stars Price: 4 stars (you get what you pay for) Authenticity: 2 stars (only because they had asian looking ppl making sushi and we got chopsticks)  Total grade: 2.83 stars."}
{"text":"Ok. First of all I like sushi. I learned to make sushi from a sushi chef while living in Japan. I'm picky about sushi.  Love this restaurant.  As you may know, I rate food based on how close it is to a Raw vegan diet. That said, #Ra is raw, the food is fresh. There is very little that is unhealthy, so they get a 4 star from me for healthy fresh food! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ok so right off the bat i took off 3 stars for the exceptionally slow and unfair service and -1 for food, I would do 0 stars if possible. We had just gotten off the plane and checked in so we were starving. It was a rather slow Friday night and there were only a couple of other tables there. We were there with a party of 5 and ordered with our exceptionally slow and blonde server. We then proceed to wait for an additional 25 minutes. Then a group of about 6 people walk in and are seated. About 10 minutes later, mind you it has been about 35 minutes for us, our shit for brains waitress comes out carrying a plate or two of food and we thought finally food is here! No guess not, she walks over to the table she just seated next to us and said something like this \"oh the kitchen messed up *stupid giggle* and they made all this extra food you guys can have it since you've waited so long *annoying giggle*\", I wanted to get up and slap the ho! She got a $1 tip for being an asshole. Other than that, the food was a trendy and some what a not successful attempt to be creative with Japanese food. I love traditional Japanese food too but I do appreciate new twists on things. Some things on their menu worked while some I just looked at the description and cringed. I enjoyed the food since we were so hungry. If the waitress was not such a dick I think I would have enjoyed myself alot more."}
{"text":"Let's just say I've never been disappointed with RA!  This is the first time I've been to this location so I wasn't sure if the quality of their sushi would differ.  They offer a very good deal with four rolls for $25.  We had three people so we decided to order another roll!  Their calamari/sushi roll was the only roll that was less than amazing!  I will definitely return and just know not to order this roll   $25 for four rolls is a heck of a deal, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Our server was nice. Nothing special. This seems more like a girls night for drinks which is usually why I go but I went there for date night with my fiancée and wasn't super crazy about it. I think its because the food is not good. Which I expect for a place like this. Drinks and calamari are the only 2 things for me there. Sushi rice always fails without a doubt. Meh- just a cool place for drinks overall"}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour. Sorry but I was not happy. I ordered a rainbow roll and it was quite dry. The avocado was dark and mushy. I ordered this one thing that was their specialty. I don't even remember it wasn't that good. Our waitress kept us waiting for long periods of time . I wanted my soda refilled and she never came back I had to get another waitress attention for the bill and yes we waited again. Next time I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Reverse happy hour.   That's all you need to know!  No really, this is a great place to go later in the evening (like 10:30 or 11) for a drink special or a light appetizer.  I've never been here during normal dinner hours, so I can't speak about the dining experience, but I love hanging out here at night with a friend."}
{"text":"I'm in love -- with a sushi restaurant.  Wanted to try a new place and new menu items, so wandered into Ra during happy hour.  Even though I was sitting at the sushi bar, the service was excellent, from the friendly chef making the sushi right in front of me to the server who answered all of my questions to the guy who kept picking up my empty plates.    My appetizer was perfectly crisp wontons filled with cream cheese and served with a pineapple dipping sauce.  Next was a beautifully crafted and presented garlic yellowtail chili ponzu roll.  As I finished, I asked the guy seated two chairs down what he ordered, since his roll had artistic thin wheels of something sticking out of it.  He offered me a piece, and I graciously (and greedily) accepted.  Deliciousness!  It was the Las Vegas roll, a combination of crab and cream cheese, spicy tuna and lotus root, topped with eel sauce and crunchy tempura.    I was contemplating whether I had room for another roll, when the waitress asked if I wanted dessert.  I asked what kind of dessert.  And she said . . . well, I ended up with dessert.  There are several choices, and I went with the mochi ice cream that comes with three flavors, circled around a scoop of whipped cream drizzled with chocolate sauce.    All so good.  Reasonable prices.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Having been to 3 other sushi places in the same week, you just realize how the sushi here is so mediocre. It's not terrible but it's below average. The happy hour prizes make it better but then... it's still kind of expensive in my opinion when compared to the taste and quality of the other sushi restaurants I went to in the area. Unless you are stuck on Mill ave., save yourself the trouble and go to a place that is better quality and better prices."}
{"text":"Great sushi, lousy service. Have eaten here several times and always had great service. This time took 20+ minutes for each order that we put in.  Manager said that our waitress was new. He gave us a coupon for a free roll on our next visit. Fish is top notch but service was not this time around."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today.. Food was good. Server wasn't. Placed order for our food. Got most of it. Asked our server for the last thing we ordered and responded with if I made sure it went through. I don't work there! You do. Totally forgot about our food and when it did arrive wasn't even hungry anymore. 2 star for the food/drinks we did have. Going to go elsewhere next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Love the outdoor seating on the back patio away from smokers and street people. Great mellow ambiance.   Went for lunch and staff was friendly, not pushy, helpful and prompt .   The rolls were ok; I've had better to be honest. For the price, I would definitely go during happy hour, because for a sushi spot near the university- your driving your market away. I'm wondering however, if they make most of their money on drinks as their cocktail menu was pretty long, and the sake menu was pretty standard, but had some good choices.  Would love to go back for happy hour for the ambiance, location and sake.   PS: get a bike rack for the back patio."}
{"text":"Not horrible but the worst sushi I've ever had. The spicy tuna roll was mushy like they put it through a food processor. I did not like the texture and have never seen that before. Rice for sushi was seasoned ok but the rice was a little undercooked. I got the vegetable sushi which was wrapped in some weird product that was not tasty at all. The dragon roll came with a sweet teriyaki sauce on top which would've been better if it was less sweet and had more ginger or sesame or savory flavor. The service was fine. The restaurant is kind of dirty and run down looking, very dark, obnoxious music. Won't return. I like supermarket sushi better."}
{"text":"Meh. Not the best sushi in town that's for sure. Let's start with the ambience, it's clean, very Americanized. One star. Now the staff, sure they look nice but do they act nice? Now that's another story. They were busy but there were a couple of girls plus a hostess then a guy staff just came in, surely they couldve been more warmer or made some effort or gave more time on serving us, but no. My friend was about to ask something and the hostess immediately turned her back at her. Maybe it isn't her job to serve us, I get that. But an \"I'll get your server for you in a moment\" wouldn't hurt.  I am extremely picky on service because I serve as well. Oh well. The food was definitely eye candy.. Very attractive. Another Star for that. They were all pretty and clean and looked scrumptious, the taste however was disappointing. We ordered the wrong things maybe? But with 5 dishes, just one was okay,. And it wasn't even like okay that i will come back for, it was just okay. Will I visit this joint soon? Probably if I had no choice and I'm seriously craving for some Japanese Food and there's absolutely no other place open. But I doubt that that'll happen. Oh well."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for lunch. Inside, it has the traditional Japanese decor, with the option to sit at a table or at the sushi bar to watch the chefs. You can also sit on the patio if the weather is nice. The wait staff is above average, but they sometimes are a little slow in refilling water, taking orders, etc.  For lunch, they have a great special. You get a salad, miso soup, a California roll, and a few pieces of nigiri. The sushi rolls are very fresh, and the seafood is of very high quality. They also give you a good amount of seafood for your money. The flavors are also very good on most of the sauces and seasonings."}
{"text":"Patrick was on point. Came in for st Pattys Day and he guided us through the menu was very attentive and exceptional .. he is five star !! I am a local been in the business 20 years and he nailed it !! Way to go. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Sushi was not anything special.  Viva Las Vegas roll and Rainbow roll seemed skimpy.  Wings were soggy.  Happy Hour Drinks pricing was good, frozen drink of the day was very good.  Next time out for sushi will choose another place."}
{"text":"Located near Treasure Island, just off the main strip, this place was exactly what my husband and I were craving.  The price was surprisingly affordable, according to Vegas standards, and the seafood was super fresh.  We were starving and parched and this place was a wonderful surprise!  The look is very trendy and would be a neat place to be in the evening.  We were there at the beginning of lunch time and were seated almost immediately.  The waitstaff were professional and friendly, no complaints on their customer service whatsoever.   For appetizer we had the Crispy Spicy Tuna.  The raw tuna mixture is served on top of crispy rice with a pepper soy sauce with fresh jalapeno on top. It tasted super fresh and the heat from the jalapeno was exactly what I would want.  If you don't enjoy spice, this is probably not the appetizer for you.  Because the pepper is fresh, not pickled, it can pack a little punch.  For our meal my husband and I shared the: Scallop Dynamite, Spicy Lobster, Ra'ckin Roll, and Viva Las Vegas rolls.  All were beautifully served and tasted amazing.  The Scallop Dynamite roll is served warm, which was a nice change of pace, since most sushi rolls are cold when served.  We would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I came here on Friday night for Happy Hour and dinner. I had a great experience and the staff were friendly as always. I highly recommend getting the Viva Las Vegas roll here."}
{"text":"Good: the eye candy is delicious, and the udon is decent.  Neutral/Bad: pretty much everything else. I couldn't hear but maybe 20% of what my dinner companions were saying over the blaring music, even when they were sitting right next to me. Overabundance of loud, obnoxious Guidos and douchebags with the obligatory popped collars and fauxhawks. I'm a sushi n00b, but even I could tell the bland, limp things my companions ordered were not right - if it's supposed to be tuna, shouldn't it be at least marginally tuna-flavored? The green tea tastes like coarsely-ground tree bark and looks like antifreeze. Finally, being in Old Town, parking is non-existent unless you're willing to walk from one of the public lots.  I'm not going back, not even on a bet. There's plenty of better sushi places in the Valley."}
{"text":"Quick service. Friendly and helpful staff. Server very knowledgable about menu was able to make suggestions. Sushi selection very good. Sushi quality excellent. Nutty chicken salad very good and refreshing. Miso soup one of the best. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I've given RA 3 solid try's. Disappointed each time. I've had fresher suishi from Safeway. Each time it tasted like the sushi was made that morning (at best), then kept in a refrigerator. The ginger is even rotten. It's overpriced, and just not good. At this location the servers don't care about anything really. They poured water into my soda at the end (first refill) then still charged me for it. Never refilling the soda. Maybe it was a long day for her, but don't make the customer suffer for it. I can't step foot in another RA. Anytime someone has recommended this place, I've never trusted their judgment again..."}
{"text":"All of the tables are dirty. The manager was rude about it when we told him how we were disappointed with it. They put new place settings like they thought it was clean, even though it was clearly not. Every table is dirty. Every chair has food on them. The sushi chef was very polite and our server was nice also. The manager cut us off while we were talking and told us he would get it taken care of. While we were eating, the manager was acting like he was vacuuming and giving us a dirty look, trying to get us to notice him. Extremely rude."}
{"text":"After finding numerous on-resort restaurants that were underwhelming and overpriced, we were thrilled to find Ra Sushi. Reasonably priced, fast and very fresh. Plus all-day happy hour specials on food and drinks weren't bad, either! Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Always fantastic sushi!  Came here today during lunch...wasn't busy. We decided to sit out on the patio due to the beautiful weather. It took a long time waiting to order. But once our waitress- Chelsea- arrived she was friendly and accommodating!  Ordered the spicy salmon bowl on my previous visit, and although last time it was a bit on the spicy side, I thought I would give it a try again. I requested light on the spicyiness. The bowl was light on the heat. Although I do recall a bit of seaweed on my last bowl, this one was delicious mingling with the cucumber and asparagus.  Would I come here again for lunch? Absolutely!  Thank you Ra!!"}
{"text":"Checked out RA Friday evening before going to see Le' Reve across the street at the Wynn.  Arrived during Happy Hour.  The specials were awesome!!  We ordered several of the specials and also the spring seasonal drink, Pineapple Express.  Everything was very flavorful including the sushi.  My favorite roll was the Pacific Roll.  We had a waitress who catered to our every need and never was out of a \"beverage.\"  I totally recommend Tracy...she is very attentive and a great personality.  RA will definitely be on my food menu next time I am in town."}
{"text":"I am sooooo torn between 2 and 3 stars. Problem is, I will go back for the happy hour special. I tried it because the pineapple cream cheese scallion appetizer sounded yummy. Plus, the cucumber margarita sounded delicious too. So, drink came first and it was DELISH!!!!! Absolutely DELISH! Next, came high anticipated appetizer. HUGE let down! Greasy with zero flavor. I ordered another drink and got the tempura bento box. I think the temperature on the food could be hotter, as I would have enjoyed more if it was. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either. 2 stars for the food. Wasn't impressed. 5 stars for the cucumber margarita. Service Ok, prices....well, it's the strip, it's exactly what you'd expect. I'll let you know how it is during happy hour!"}
{"text":"Viva Las Vegas Roll (5 stars) Crispy Spicy Tuna Roll Chicken Wings (Of course) 2 Sake  5 Stars because this place is special to me :)"}
{"text":"We went during the night happy hour.  We arrived pretty late, but they were still very accommodating, well, at first.  So, honestly, that's the only reason I gave 4 instead of 5.  The food was terrific, but service was slow as all get out... no wasabi or ginger brought out... we waited and waited... finally got it from another waitress.  But, we go every time we go to Vegas and I'm certain we'll go again.  I just hope the service is better."}
{"text":"This place could be a lot better, being in the heart of Scottsdale. Every time I go there the service is not too good. The staff members seem to be a bit snooty, and not very knowledgeable or helpful. I have never been uncomfortable asking my server to refill my drink because they forgot or to simply grab their attention to ask a question.   The sushi itself is tasty, although not super authentic. I guess that's what you get when you go to a chain.   I do have to applaud them on their VIVA LAS VEGAS ROLLS, still by FAR the best vegas roll I've tried in all Scottsdale! Super delicious! Their happy hour (drink-wise) is also excellent, and the place inside is stunning. I love the dim, red lighting in the inside!  Their customer service definitely needs a boost, and the servers are very good-looking but need not be so snooty and focus that energy on aiding guests with their questions on the menu."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and the service was great.  The food was lacking.  The rice in the rolls had the wrong consistency,  it was like some of the rice was still crunchy.  The rainbow roll eas ok, but not great.  If you want quick Sushi in the area, it's not bad.  If you want great sushi,  go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I was an ASU student, for birthdays, after school happy hour-you name it!  The sushi was always prepared well although a bit overpriced for the area.  The staff was always obliging and the location was pretty prime.  You could start out here and visit the remainder of the shops on mill for Happy Hour and end the night at Cue for the full Mill Ave experience.  Or you could stop here before an ASU game if you aren't the tailgating type.  All in all, pretty standard sushi restaurant with great locational benefits."}
{"text":"first time going here and it was very good sushi and rolls !!! the waitress was great and actually helped us decide what we were going to order... definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Decent prices for decent sushi.  Sake for $1 during happy hour almost made me gave this place 4 stars but not quite.  Our waitress was such a biatch and gave us so much attitude for  no forgivable reason!  She kept rolling her eyes, screwed up on our orders, and overcharged us when we got the bill!  Grrrr... gets me all worked up just reliving it.  *breathe in... breathe out... $1 sake... okay, I'll stick to 3 stars for RA."}
{"text":"Ok. Well, bar tender Chris was amazing. Attentive and encouraging to try new things.  If it wasn't for him I'd give it a 2 start rating. Sushi was alright, saki was great. Try the saki flight!!  Make sure u sit at the bar for a great experience."}
{"text":"This restaurant is hands down the best place to get sushi. Aside from the great atmosphere, the sushi is divine. It is packed tightly and is always fresh, This is the go to restaurant for me and my girlfriend, and it was one of our earliest date locations. I'm never disappointed when I visit Ra and if I could afford to go more often, I would be a very frequent customer."}
{"text":"This review is only for the happy hour. I cannot imagine there being a better happy hour in Vegas than the one at Ra. The quality of sushi they are serving for the prices is unbelievable. Given the high prices of everything in Vegas especially on the strip we were thrilled to come across this place. We went right when the happy hour started and stayed a good 2 hours. The Umami punch for $14 was the best drink deal we encountered on our trip. We sat right at the sushi bar so service was great.  We sampled a bunch of different items from their happy hour menu and did not have anything that I disliked. Below is what we tried:  Pineapple Cheese Wontons 5/5 Cucumber Sunomono 4/5 California Roll 4/5 Spicy Sesame Chicken Wings 4/5 Garlic Citrus Yellowtail 5/5 Tootsy Maki 4/5 Vegetarian Roll 4/5 Cinnamon Tempura Gelato 5/5  If you are looking for a good meal and to have a few drinks I highly recommend coming here for happy hour. We had a great time, had a nice buzz, full tummy and really enjoyed our experience at this location."}
{"text":"Tay and David were so great tonight. She took care of our large group we were there for the entire happy hour and Tay made sure we knew what was best to drink and eat. She kept the drinks flowing and even stayed after our shift because yep... We were there the entire time. And the food was great too. Will def come back next time we are in Vegas. Best dinning experience we had the entire weekend."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour ... The peach sangria is really good but the sushi rolls weren't that good.. Happy hour was still kinda pricey, although I will come back for the coconut creme brulee it was amazinggggg! I feel like kona grill (next door) has better prices & sushi for HH..."}
{"text":"Great location, located on the Las Vegas strip at the Fashion Show mall.  Great outdoor seating!  I found it on the pricier side, but again it is on the strip in Vegas.  I order out here often as I work very nearby.  They do not, however give a mall discount for carry out :(  Happy hour prices are pretty good if you eat in!  The 'viva las Vegas' roll is a favorite (crab, cream cheese lightly battered topped off with Lotus root) it's different, great sauce.  Also a must try is the 'Toosy Maki', crab and shrimp with sweet eel sauce.   Location: 4 stars  Atmosphere: 3 1/2 stars (who doesn't love looking at the las Vegas strip) Food: 3 stars Service: 3 Price: 2 Stars (however dinning in during happy hour I give the price 4 stars)  If you want a trendy, Vegas strip basic sushi experience then this is a must stop at.  The location is great, tasty drinks and good happy hour specials.  I've had better but it's clean, funky and has a great vibe!"}
{"text":"Went in a couple of days ago with my girlfriend and I have to say..... it was probably one of the best restaurant experiences I had!!!! Our waitress Audra was supper nice and even had us try one of her favorite sauces and we were in love!! She did a great job on checking in with us every few minutes and made sure we were good with our meal. She was awesome! Can't wait to go back in so I can order the Creamy Tataki Sauce! Fire!!! Great service!"}
{"text":"The food is so good, I gave it a 4. Service could definitely use a boost, although they are usually pretty nice. Maybe just a busy Saturday evening and lots to do. Waiter wasn't so attentive and girl at the front desk looked irritated when I interrupted her conversation so I could be seated. Maybe they just need one or two more wait staff.  I had the Bari chirashi bowl. To die for. It's like a sashimi, cucumber and avocado poke over rice. Soooooo flavorful! They also have really good tempura. Never greasy.  Cocktails are always on point. This place really is a must visit while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I've been to this one a few times now and I enjoy it! Happy Hour is the best because the Viva La Vegas Roll is half price! Good staff, but I can't say that I've tried anything more than the Vegas Roll, still a newbie!"}
{"text":"So I do not like sushi...the thought of it makes me cringe...so when my friend wanted sushi I immediately asked if they had other stuff besides sushi...she said yes so I went...I had the spicy teriyaki Udon noodles with chicken...it was really good!!!! The edamame was also good...both were cooked perfectly...my fries had 2 kinds of sushi and also liked it..."}
{"text":"I've been to Ra numerous times, and I think it's pretty consistent.  If you're not into loud music or a Scottsdale 'scene,' stay away.  However, if you want decent sushi in a trendy atmosphere, Ra will deliver.  Sunday night is 'industry night' and after 8:30 there are lots of specials to choose from.  I went with a group tonight and we shared edamame and a variety of rolls, including california, yellowtail, spicy tuna, tootsy maki, salmon nigiri, and more.  I also enjoy the seaweed salad and miso soup at Ra... there is something for everyone from sushi connoisseurs to those that won't touch anything raw.  This location will allow you to bring your dog as long as it's outside of the fence.  Great patio overlooking the Kierland parking lot ;) In summary, I think it's above average sushi for a chain restaurant - don't go in with the highest expectations and you'll be satisfied!  Thanks to our server, Sara, for putting up with our group - we had a few obnoxious guys with us tonight :)"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place on a whim. It has a nice atmosphere and service was great. I ordered salmon sashimi and it was very fresh. They also had fresh wasabi - a must with good sushi. The rest of my order was blah. Spicy lobster roll was bland and I couldn't even tell there was lobster in it. The spicy salmon tacos tasted fishy and had very little sushi and too much guacamole. The ra chips and salsa was way too sweet and just not good. I ate at the sushi bar which has crumbs and drips from prior customers. It wasn't all bad, but I won't come back."}
{"text":"I like Ra, but their specialty drinks have never been very good. The food isn't bad or too expensive, but for some reason I just don't love this place. You can't smoke on the patio (might be some sort of law that isn't their fault), which is a main reason we usually choose sandbar for drinks instead of Ra. We come here for sake once in a while because it is so close to home, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat or have drinks here."}
{"text":"The online menu had a different price than the actual menu. We came for the online happy hour prices and when we asked a manager to honor the online price he refused."}
{"text":"Wow! Been to the San Diego gaslamp location tons of times before it closed. Glad I came across this one in AZ! I knew RA had other locations, and I was very disappointed when the San Diego one closed. It was my go-to place. I was Here in Arizona in business, I saw this one while walking around Scottsdale and couldn't believe it. The chili shrimp roll is a must! As well as the Las Vegas roll. I had to..  Btw.... we had our suitcases with us since I was on my way to the airport when I stopped here. They let me and my dad store them while we were here. Thank you."}
{"text":"I've been a fan of RA Sushi's tasty cuisine for a while because I'm from San Diego and I loved going to the Happy Hour at RA Sushi there. Although I have to admit that I like the decor and service at RA Sushi in Downtown SD better then the one here in Vegas the food didn't disappoint. My favorite dishes are the Seared Ahi and the Yellowtail Sashimi appetizers! I seriously get like 2 of each at a time... And I don't share lol. If you go get a drink from Mary at the Bar and request Jordan or Jackie as your server... Your welcome ;)"}
{"text":"Slow service, fried shrimp was cooked in old oil and tasted burnt.   Our table was not wiped down and dishes/glassware was not clean.    California roll was good."}
{"text":"Yes it's hip and cool. Go there to be seen not eat.   The texture of tuna sashimi was soft and limp. It seems like it was thawed out and definitely not fresh.  The seared tuna was disappointing also. The combined flavors didn't taste right. The cucumber salad was acidic.    At least the sushi rolls were somewhat decent."}
{"text":"It's just ok, not bad, not great, but decent and convenient if you are going to the movies. Our server, Katie, was pleasant and attentive.   We ordered:  Viva Las Vegas Roll - pretty good Gojira Roll - yummy Pacific Roll - (I thought it was just ok, but the man really liked it) Spicy Yellowtail - usually my favorite, but there was no \"spicy\" to it :( Philadelphia Roll - (I usually don't like this one, but it was very tasty) Shrimp Tempura Roll - (I would recommend this one, but the tempura needs...some oomph!)  All in all, it was a nice visit and the prices weren't too bad."}
{"text":"Had lunch here on 5-15-15 and it was great. Sushi was very good and the teriyaki chicken bowl was great!"}
{"text":"Great location, great food, great price, HORRIBLE service. Already complained to the manager about the service and he still think they have the best service in Vegas. Called and requested some food to go, they said in 30 minutes would be ready. Got there 30 min later and the food wasn't ready. Waited more 20 min. If I wanted to wait I wouldn't have call."}
{"text":"Date visited: 2008-07-04  When in Vegas, I normally do not eat at restaurants... It's always buffets.  However, figuring it was a Friday night and July 4th, we thought it would be best to eat at a restaurant instead of facing the long buffet dinner lines.  I chose this place because the Yelp reviews said it was decently priced with decent food and it was close to our hotel.  We sat down with about 20 minutes left before the end of Happy Hour so my brother and I ordered 5 items - 4 food items and 1 huge Tsunami punch (which I neglected to read from the reviews that it is a drink to share).  Highlights- -The drink was yummy. My mom liked it a lot. I think she drank more than I did! -I ordered my usual soft shell crab which they cooked with a harder-than-I-am-used-to batter and covered it with sesame seeds - it took away from the flavor the crab.  -I did not like the texture of the agedashi tofu.  -Nice selection on the sashimi combo - I ate my dad's tako sashimi. Yum! Chewy without giving my jaw too much of a workout.  -The rolls we ordered were only okay. I did not taste all the flavors I remembered reading on the menu when I ordered them.  I would go back just for Happy Hour or their Late Night Menu."}
{"text":"Always amazing! I frequent this restaurant in Chicago and in Las Vegas and the experience is consistently amazing. The umami punch bowl is a delicious creeper. The viva Las Vegas roll is a favorite! I also love the yellow ponzu yellowtail and the shishito peppers as an appetizer. Add on the image and the sashimi dinner to share and boom! Your all set! Never fails to satisfy my sushi needs!"}
{"text":"Amazing happy hour!!  We stopped here on vacation on advice from someone we met at a ballgame.  Very glad we went.  The HH deals they have are pretty awesome.  Our total bill was $30 and we had 3 sushi rolls, cucumber salad and 2 beers.  Not bad at all.  The sushi was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"BACKGROUND  My friend, Eva, LOVES getting happy hour at this particular location, hence, we've been here countless times, and we've ALWAYS had a great time here.  I've also been here on date nights, and solo, and it's a solid place to get sushi  RA SUSHI BAR RESTAURANT  Interestingly, Benihana Inc owns/franchises the RA SUSHI brand, along with 116 Japanese cuisine restaurants around the world, including Benihana Teppanyaki brand, and Haru, and was founded in 1964, by Hiroaki \"Rocky\" Aoki, in NYC.  Now that there are five Phoenix area locations, including, Ahwatukee, North Scottsdale, Mesa, Old Town Scottsdale, and Tempe, it's safe to say the RA SUSHI franchise is going strong in Arizona.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  My last experience at this establishment was last week after my dentist extravaganza. After 3 hours of dentistry, I thought I deserved a little sushi treat.  At this location, I usually like sitting at the bar, although at my last visit, I sat at the sushi bar and chatted with the very charming sushi chef.  Of course, I asked for my FAVORITE drink, the Fuzzy Momo Bellini, and sadly, their frozen ice machine was broken.   Ughhhh, that drink is my highlight. Oh well, I tried the Pretty in Pink, and it was alright, but not a Fuzzy Momo Bellini.  Since the Pretty in Pink didn't hit the spot, I got a Sapporo light. I also ordered the quail egg shooter, which came with sake, which was VERY DELICIOUS.  One of my mainstay, must-haves, is the tuna sashimi, as the tuna is always EXCELLENT here. Then, I like to venture out and try some fancy rolls.  My sushi chef recommend the caterpillar roll and the rainbow roll, and I picked the mango lobster roll, which were all OMG YUMMY; like melt in your mouth fantastic flavors.   The servers are always very pleasant, this time I was lucky to have Bryana. Even when you sit at the sushi bar, the servers take the drink orders and bring out the items from the kitchen that don't involve the sushi bar.  CONCLUSION  RA SUSHI has a soft spot in my heart, since I've had so many great experiences here, so I admit a little bit of a bias.   Honestly, this particular location is nice, and mostly 4 Star, although parts of the experience were 3-3.5 Star, mostly the décor. It's a competitive market out there with all of the new high end spots, so I need to be honest.  For the non-aficionado, this Ahwatukee location of RA SUSHI BAR RESTAURANT is a solid place to get sushi.  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Plenty of parking out front.  *For more information: rasushi.com"}
{"text":"BACKGROUND  First of all, I have to admit a slight crush on this particular location of RA.  When I first moved up to Phoenix, Arizona, as a freshman, to go to ASU, I lived at Hayden Square, which is right across the street from RA.  Me and my friends spent so much time here, so I have a lot of fond memories here.  RA SUSHI BAR RESTAURANT  Interestingly, Benihana Inc owns/franchises the RA SUSHI brand, along with 116 Japanese cuisine restaurants around the world, including Benihana Teppanyaki brand, and Haru, and was founded in 1964, by Hiroaki \"Rocky\" Aoki, in NYC.  Now that there are five Phoenix area locations, including, Ahwatukee, North Scottsdale, Mesa, Old Town Scottsdale, and Tempe, it's safe to say the RA SUSHI franchise is going strong in Arizona.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  As I mentioned, I've been here countless times, even times before Yelp even existed.  The last time, I went with my mom, after checking out the Desert Botanical Garden.  I love the sexy vibe and den-like atmosphere at this location, and the hostesses are always STUNNING and very professional.  I like sitting at the sushi bar and chatting with the sushi chef.  My mom and I like to get several items and share.  The last time we got a couple specialty rolls and some sashimi. A couple of my mainstay, must-haves, are the tuna roll and tuna sashimi, as the tuna is always EXCELLENT here. Then, I like to venture out and try some fancy rolls.  I also love their girly frozen specialty drink menu. My absolute favorite is the Fuzzy Momo Bellini, although the Blushing Geisha is super tasty too. But so is their sake and a Sapporo always hits the spot.  The servers are always very pleasant. Even when you sit at the sushi bar, they take the drink orders and bring out the items from the kitchen that don't involve the sushi bar.  The biggest downfall, is the parking. This location is right on the historic Mill Avenue, and if you're not lucky enough to get the metered parking out front, then good luck.  CONCLUSION  What can I say, I'm a fan. Although there are definitely more advanced sushi options in the Phoenix area, RA SUSHI BAR RESTAURANT in Tempe is definitely a fantastic choice.  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Metered parking out front.  *For more information: rasushi.com"}
{"text":"First things first, I came to this place with an open mind for a friend's birthday dinner. The menu is rather short so don't expect a lot of options.   I ordered the vegetable gyoza as an appetizer and they were pretty good! I'd definitely recommend them in the future. However, the sushi was beyond pathetic.   I've had different spicy tuna rolls before but what I got here was nothing short of tasteless fish mush.  The rolls looked pretty enough, but they fell apart almost immediately. Even worse was how there was nothing spicy about them! If you're going to serve a spicy fish mush roll at least put some spicy mayo or something on top of it to make it seem like you tried.   The overall experience was pretty bad. Service was fine, gyoza was fantastic, but the sushi was awful. Thankfully there was plenty of ginger nearby to get the taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"Im giving RA Sushi's happy hour 4 stars based on price.  The price of sushi was really really good.  I believe $3.25 for a few rolls we got.  Now, on a regular price menu, I would be erked to pay 6.50.  The rolls were really LOOSE! Everytime I used my chop sticks to pick them up, I about squeezed all the way through the roll.  Although the rolls did have a good taste, and they were fresh (what i mean by that is they're cool, not warm or room temp). The atmosphere is great, as well as the ambiance.  If you want some cheap sushi this is definitely the spot, just do the happy hour before you decide on doing dinner to see if it meets your standards.  I would be ticked to get that sushi at full price"}
{"text":"This is some of the best sushi that I have ever had, and ironically it is in the desert! Every time we have eaten here the sushi is so fresh. We can always count on a fresh, reasonably priced meal at Ra. On top of that, we have observed that the servers are exceptional! They are so kind, friendly, patient and attentive. Thank you for always giving us a great meal and experience."}
{"text":"Came for happy hour for a late lunch on a Thursday around 4pm. It was moderately busy in the bar facing the front of the Fashion Show mall.  I was seated inside at a table and it was very quiet but the server was very nice and helpful.  I had the yellowtail sushi and a shrimp tempura roll - both were very fresh and enjoyable. The happy hour prices were very reasonable, and a more affordable alternative to the upscale casino sushi restaurants nearby.  There wasn't any sauce on the side of the roll I had ordered, but I was fine with the soy sauce/wasabi instead. I'd come back again for a moderately priced sushi fix in this area."}
{"text":"I'm a huge sushi fan, theirs was only ok, nothing special.  Atmosphere was great but way too loud for a date, we sat on the patio in the misters and was really nice.  Service was great."}
{"text":"2nd visit more fantastic than the first - the spicy Miso was so good it made me wanna steal the recipe so I could make it at home every day. Great rolls and delicious sake. Man, I wanna make sure I visit this place every time I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"Our Sunday night plans turned out lamer than expected, and RA's reverse happy hour saved the evening! All dressed up on a Sunday evening with nowhere special to go? Ra will do!  Sunday nights they 'transform' the bar in to the 'Flying Fish Lounge.' A DJ sets up right around 8pm in the corner of the bar and the beats stay bumping til close. Though the beats are nothing out of this world, it just spice up the bar area, but doesn't cause too much commotion in the restaurant area...  Drinks & food at RA are overpriced regularly, but as mentioned, for HH, you can't complain. The prices range from $2-$7 for both drinks & sushi specials. Big rolls like the amazing Las Vegas Roll & probably the shrimp tempura are $7, basic rolls like spicy tuna are $4, & I think the nigri is $3.. Hot sake - $1, Big Kirin beers are only like $3, & their mix drinks range, but are never that impressive.  That night I ordered two rolls (the toosty maki is always a winner if you like eel sauce) & some yummy Albacore appetizer and my tab was $19. My girlfriend ordered dessert, and it looked amazing! An asian spin on the banana split, it was served like a tempura sushi roll, but instead was fried ice cream smothered in chocolate sauce, whipped cream, strawberries, etc. looked amazing!  Oh Ra, you may be a chain but I'm glad to have you close."}
{"text":"Last weekend I went to the Bevvy Uptown on 7th street and didn't have anyone ask me for a drink after being there for 10-15 minutes.  Just now I went to RA Sushi Bar located at Dana Park and was greeted quickly by the bartender and was asked what I would like to drink.  Drink was provided in a quick manner.....but then could not order any food!  I was sitting there waiting and waiting, but the bartender proceeded to get the drink order of the couple who sat down next to me after I already had my drink and was waiting for several minutes, she made their drinks and brought it to them, but didn't check to see if I would like to order food.  Then after waiting longer, the bartender checked on the two gentlemen sitting to my left and took more drink orders for them as they already had food and drinks and didn't check if I wanted to order food - brought their drinks and then did not check if I wanted anything to eat.  Waited too long to be able to just place a food order at the bar!  You can say it was busy, but I've been to numerous restaurants and bars where the service is clearly much better than this! either the Bartender cannot handle it or need to hire more employees to work the bar! which actually Happy Hour was coming to an end, so maybe holding off for higher tickets for the server, which means higher tips."}
{"text":"Sushi was good enough, though the wait time was ridiculous! My main complaint is that the soy sauce on the table is the regular, sodium drenched soy sauce. Having dined at many other sushi restaurants in Las Vegas and around the globe, I've become accustomed to having low sodium soy sauce on the table,, always when there is only one choice!  Today, after realizing it was super salty, I asked if this was low sodium. \"No,\" the server replied, \"I can get you some, if you'd like.\"  Get with the times RA, it's a competitive world out there!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ, we decided to go get some sushi and picked RA. Sat down and it took a little bit for someone to come talk with us. Come to find out our waiter Sam was just making sure to talk with a customer who talked a lot. (Good service in my book) Sam was great for the entire time! He made fantastic recommendation on one of the beers RA offers, he recommended a club to visit tonight and even poured the rest of my beer for me when he noticed my glass was low! Great sushi, BEYOND great customer service from Sam and definitely will be back after my buzz goes away :) lots of things I'd like to try on the menu"}
{"text":"Gabby is awesome! The two times I've come here she always greets me with a smile and is so attentive. It's staff like her that will keep me coming back. I love that there's a variety of options on their happy hour menu and delicious specialty cooked rolls. Great customer service goes a long way. Guinevere was awesome too! This is my go to sushi spot whenever I'm in town. Great convenient location downtown by the light rail. Keep up the great work ladies!! You rock!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat. Better than other sushi places I've been to in Tempe. The look of the restaurant is dark and their main colors are black and red which looked really nice. Their service was good, nothing to complain about. Best part? If you park in the mission palm parking lot (and pay) this restaurant will give you the money back! Free parking to eat here. Pretty cool right?  Any ways, I really enjoyed my Ra'cking Roll -- fried shrimp was delicious! Also ordered the baked scallop rolls and monkey roll. I really liked the baked scallop, not so much the monkey roll. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Didn't have so much sushi as 1/2 off appetizers and sake, but that's more than enough for 4 stars.  My gf and I had total hunger pangs, finally, a few hours after our hotel buffet.  But when that hunger hit, it was severe.  Maybe that was why we had so much trouble finding the place (it's right under Maggiano's, you shouldn't be able to miss it--um, but maybe we were hungover).  Sake and RA chips and salsa: YUM."}
{"text":"Food is always consistent. Lobster spring rolls are a delicious appetizer. Favorite sushi roll is the Viva las Vegas. Pomegranate green tea is yummy. Not too pricey. Nice atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"Not alot to say but the service from i think hayden was amazing he was so nice and helped us with whatever we needed."}
{"text":"Great late night eats spot!  I ordered green tea because I was the designated driver and they freshly brewed and strained it right in front of me!! It was so cool.   You have to try the spicy garlic edamame. It is delicious :)"}
{"text":"Back again and once again Heidi takes total control of the situation. Drinks on point, food flying in. Seriously, this place would suck if it weren't for people like her. Great staff brings return customers which bring great reviews. Keep up the good work..."}
{"text":"RA sushi is so-so for sushi. It's not spectacular, but usually not terrible either. A group of us (7) came on a Saturday night and while we expected a wait for food and such because it was a weekend night, the service was much too slow. We had to remind our server to refill our drinks when they stood empty for 10+ minutes because we didn't know where our server went. A few of us ordered the same alcoholic drinks, but they were prepared differently. I don't know what was going at the bar. The food must have taken 30-45 minutes to come out. Overall, a so-so experience."}
{"text":"You must try the Calamari!  It is the best I've had.  I also had a sushi roll that was really good.  I was happy and will definitely be going back.  What they could change is the volume on the music.  It was incredibly loud.  Then while we were eating they actually turned it up and I had to request that they turn it back down.  It really was at a ridiculous level where we couldn't hear each other across a table without yelling.  When I left I had to take a couple of Excedrin."}
{"text":"This was a great lunch visit. Sashimi salad was perfectly prepared. Good was fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Really good happy hour and the service was awesome!! Our server was Cory and he was great very knowledgeable about the different Rolls and all the specials?. Thanks again for making it special!!"}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer at RA Sushi in Huntington Beach, California, love the food and environment there. On vacation in Arizona and decided to try RA Sushi in Scottsdale after driving over half an hour to make it to our 7:45 pm reservation. Front of house staff were friendly but need help with their customer service skills. Tried to order drinks but was then informed we weren't allowed to due to our 'vertical' California IDs. Fish was as fresh as you would expect desert sushi to be and the management staff was the least bit courteous. Overall, extremely disappointed with this establishment and most likely won't be returning to any RA Sushi establishments, take your business elsewhere"}
{"text":"They made up for the wrongs of the waitress. Food is excellent and management is kind and genuine. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is the first time at this location and while the food was great the service is horrible. Our waitress was forgetful and took forever. It wasn't busy at all. Also the music is so loud that you can't hold a conversation with the person next to you.   The food was great and came out quick. If you just want the food, then this is the place. If you want great service, go someplace else."}
{"text":"Save your money and go somewhere else. We ate outside and it was dusty and dirty. You would think that they would swap out the dishes since it's in the middle of the desert. It was overpriced like everything else in Vegas but definitely not worth it. The tuna tartare was over seasoned. And they were dousing mayo on all of the other dishes to season. Pass on the sodium overload."}
{"text":"Ra would receive 4 stars but service is inconsistent. The popular happy hour is the best part of Ra. Their \"reverse happy hour\" is clever - 10PM to midnight."}
{"text":"Can be pricey...like most places on the strip.  But if you go for happy hour its pretty reasonable.  Best pacific roll I've had."}
{"text":"Considering this place is a chain, the sushi isn't that bad. It's definitely not top of my list of best sushi spots in the valley, but it's a safe bet if you're in an area of town where you aren't sure of a good spot to grab some decent sushi."}
{"text":"I like Ra only during happy hour because its more affordable then.  I love me some sashimi and Viva Las Vegas rolls, I have yet to try more of the other RA creations but the prices for them are a little ridiculous to me to be completely honest.  I have gone to this location more than twice but not more than a handful of times. I think this past Saturday was another reminder of why I hate going to RA. Regardless of how busy it may be. I would have given the girl a break but it wasn't THAT busy!!  The things I normally ask for with my sushi I did not bother asking because our waitress was too busy gossiping with the hostess' and flirting with the guys sitting a table over.  I haven't had this bad of service in a long time, It makes you really appreciate those that are good at what they do. I cannot expect too much its the Scottsdale location i kind of saw it coming but at the same time the fact that I didn't really want to ask the waitress for the essential things I usually ask for that isn't hard to handle at all is pretty bad. Because I knew in the back of my head that the broad would take a million years to come back because she had to tell her life story to every one on the way.    I am not one to bash a restaurant or business on the regular but it just seems like every where besides ATL wings in chandler I have been not only been getting the worst service ever out with friends but not so great of food either. After this visit I highly doubt I will ever return to any ra location out of my own pure choice, and would most likely frown upon someone having the idea to go unless its for happy hour on sake. That's the only way I would go back and if someone pulled my leg to go."}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice, prompt, and fast with the drink refills. I don't even like miso soup but their's is fantastic. The vegetable tempura was awesome and was perfectly cooked. But the nutty chicken salad - literally the best salad I have ever had. It was flavorful, the chicken was tender, and it was just the right amount. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I was starving after a workout so I ordered some takeout. I got the Asian chicken salad and veggie rolls. The salad is just rough cut cabbage and super spicy cubes breaded chicken w straight soy sauce as the dressing. It's horrible. The veggie rolls are basically all lettuce and some rice. Definitely do not order these items. Sick. Way too hot to eat."}
{"text":"We have a Ra in San Diego, but the mediocre reviews never compelled me to risk it when I have my trusty old sushi standy-bys. But on a recent visit to Phoenix, my host suggested his local Ra.  I had just driven 6 hours, hadn't eaten in 10 and was so hungry I probably would have agreed to going to Petsmart and eating goldfish out of the tanks.  So, needless to say, I didn't argue.   The place was nearly empty and we were seated on the back patio. We had no problems with service - our waitress was attentive and friendly. The Happy Hour deals were good, especially for drinks. We ordered a couple of appetizers and rolls.  While I am fairly picky about my sushi preferences, I'm not a sushi purist, but if you are, this isn't the place for you. Nothing tasted bad and the fish seemed as fresh as you could expect for the price point, but they have a lot of non-traditional (read: dumbed-down for the general public) dishes.    The pineapple-cheese wonton appetizer was much more boring than it sounded like it was going to be. The sweet onion salmon sashimi would make a sushi traditionalist have a seizure, but I enjoyed the preparation of sweet onion dressing and micro greens over the fish. The crispy spicy tuna roll was also \"different\" - tempura-battered rice blocks with a mound of spicy tuna on top .Our rolls were well-rolled, had a good amount of spice and overall were nothing to complain about, but the fact remains, this is a chain basically meant to be Sushi for Dummies. If you're starving and like your sushi basic, you can get by here. If you want the real deal, go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I give this a 3 star because of service. We had to look for our waitress several times to ask for water...soy sauce...and the check place. The last one took forever. The service wasn't the best. I give the food 3 stars too. Lots of the sushi and rolls that are in the menu have cream cheese and mayonnaise in them. Not That sort of taste that i look for a good sushi and roll."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for my takeout order of sushi. The food was bad. Completely tasteless, poorly prepared, and had a bad texture. Wasabi was also missing, which made the whole situation worse, even after I confirmed with them that wasabi was definitely in the bag. Don't go here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and started off with the ribs for appetizer! They were amazing! Sushi was great. Not amazing. Also, they dont bring out ginger unless you ask them. We had to ask twice because they were stingy with it. Waitress was a bit pushy."}
{"text":"Ok, so first let us make it clear that you should not expect good sushi from many places, but this place is beyond not good. We ate there last night around 7 pm. Service was slow and not that great. BUT most concerning was the food. Room temperature rice and fish for sushi. Yes, room temperature. Fish selection itself is very limited. And given that it was room temperature made it very difficult to eat. I am actually going to email the health department as well. This is a dangerous place!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch experience because of Britney. The restaurant was slow so she was really able to take care of us and the choices we made in sushi roll were fantastic recommendations. my friend was not understanding the menu because of a language barrier so she really helped to explain all the dishes. Tasty eel and cucumber roll was my favorite"}
{"text":"Ra.......what happened?   You are well over do for a face lift. The restaurants are old and tired.  I think the bathroom at kierland is haunted. I have never been to bathroom so smelly dank dark and loud. Why is a major speaker, turned up way too loud in this pitch blapNasty bathroom?   On to the food,  I used to love happy hour.  Your prices have gone up and your customers have disappeared.  There are so many sushi bars you really cannot afford to let your guard down.  May I suggest a total redo of both restaurants? Get rid of horrid lava wall in Kierland and add really comfy out door seating. Have a true happy hour. Cheap drinks 5-7.  You have excellent locations. Time to remodel and re think you purpose of existing. Stagnation or growth.   i Update. Jan 10.  The food was very good. Not one complaint. The bathroom was soggy dark and dank but it has improved over last visit.  I was happy to see a pretty good crowd but I know the potential is for much more.   The outdoor dining is still stark and dated. With a great patio (with fans and banquets ) this place would go back to being a true hot spot.....instead of a dinosaur holding on to the past."}
{"text":"Ra Sushi is a good place for quick but good sashimi, and sushi. The bento box's are great"}
{"text":"Fish is not fresh, too much rice, rice of poor quality and too cold.  This is worse than the RA in Scottsdale that I only eat at when I stay at the hotel it's in.  Decent atmosphere here but that's where the good ends."}
{"text":"Food is super tasty. However the customer service is a bit lacking. I always seem to annoy them when I order and unfortunately they're very slow. They told me to take 20 minutes. 40 minutes later I got my to go food."}
{"text":"Service was decent because it wasn't busy but food wasn't great. Sashimi of toro was ok but wasn't the best. The udon broth was flavorless. I know these places are known for sushi but I've never ran into a place to where their udon was so bland. Will not be coming here again."}
{"text":"The atmosphere in this place is really fun and trendy.  Excellent lighting and decor.  Now...let's talk about the food.  If you are looking for an \"authentic\" Japanese restaurant, this ain't it.  This is more of a Japanese fusion type place, if you're into that.  Unfortunately, I am not.  I like my sushi to be authentic and traditional, not cream cheese mixed with fish.  I also ordered Chicken Terriyaki.  Presentation was beautiful, but my chicken was bland and dry.  Seriously, if you own a Japanese restaurant and you can't make decent Chicken Terriyaki, you should be shot.  This place is not cheap either.  So be prepared to spend a good chunk of change on lousy sushi.  To end on a positive note, the house sake was pretty good."}
{"text":"After doing a little browsing in Old Town Scottsdale, we were feeling hungry, and my friend, who has not had Japanese food in years, wanted some. So I had my first sushi in the desert.   Ra is the place in Old Town, so in we went. They have cheap specials on the lunch menu, along with a full complement of jive ass rolls, sashimi, sushi etc. I ordered beef teriyaki, my companion shrimp tempura, and as appys, I asked for a spicy scallop roll, fried soft shell crabs and seaweed salad.  The crabs came out, 2 actually, for $9.75. Now that's a bargain! They were overly breaded, too thick a batter, which dampened the crab flavor, but it still tasted quite good. The seawed salad was abundant; I love seaweed, it seems such a direct and powerful way of communion with the ocean, a meaty plant. The spicy scallop hand roll was weak, the rice overcooked and the seaweed wrap, nori, rubbery, though the actual flavor of the scallop was good.  As we waited for the main course, I looked around the room. It's quite a nice design, the sushi bar a large square in the center of the big room, the walls a mixture of stone and brightly red panels, with large red globe lamps hanging from the ceilings, bamboo also a prominent motif. The bar is at the entrance, and they seem to have an abundance of Happy Hour specials.  Our friendly waitress brought us our bento box, and I was surprised at the size and variety of side items. Coles slaw, spring roll, potstickers, stir fry veggies and a salad to go along with a decent amount of beef teryiaki,  tender slices of beef with a good, warm slightly sweet flavor. The stir fry was overcooked, unfortunately, and the postsickers and spring roll were pretty conventional, and a little out of place. But a very cheap lunch at $7.75.  This is a place that is about \"asian fusion\" for the American palate, apparently a chain with outlets in several states, so one accepts the concept, albeit reluctantly. It's not terrible, just homogenized, but I don't get how an \"asian\" restaurant can overcook veggies and turn out such a subpar hand roll. Rubbery nori? That's inexcusable.  2.5 stars see pix posted"}
{"text":"I feel like Jim Carey in Liar Liar cuz - I've had better. Atmosphere is good, waiters & waitresses are super good. It's just the sushi, this place is the McDonalds of its industry."}
{"text":"OK, so here's the thing.  I love the sushi here. I really do. I've gone to this location many times and I really love the rolls. Notable favorites: Vegas Roll, Dragon Roll, Tootsy Maki, and Spicy Tuna. Also, they have garlic edamame here and it's AMAZING.   Is there a fun, great variety? No. Is the sushi \"best in the world\" quality? No. Is the music pretty loud? Yes. They DO have reverse happy hour, which is of course great. However, the first time my friend and I came late at night, there was no problem; the second, we were told that unless we were of age to drink, we couldn't come in. It didn't make sense. We were not trying to drink or sit at the bar, and it's not like RA becomes some sort of nightclub after 10. Still, the waiter refused to seat us. So that was kind of, well, off-putting. It's the main reason for 3 stars rather than 4.  Otherwise, it's fine, but there are better sushi places out there."}
{"text":"I came here on business trip with a co-worker.    Good vibe, good waitresses, beautiful women, okay food.    Based on strictly food, this place was just okay.  Being from the bay area and trying sushi in Hawaii, the sushi here is just alright.  The sushi wasn't very fresh at all.  I checked in to Foursquare and got a FREE miso soup.  I was really excited for this miso soup, and right when I tasted it, I was not impressed at all.  It was just super watered down.  As far as service, it was great.  The hostess was absolutely beautiful, but what sucked is after my coworker and I tried talking to her, she told us she was only 17...so be aware.  The waitresses were also just gorgeous, this place much hire only good looking people.  Back to service...the service was great.  They brought out the food in a timely manner, but she was not very knowledgeable about he food so she couldn't provide any good recommendations.    Price - 2 rolls, large sake - $34 bucks (including tip).  About normal for any sushi place.  This was not during happy hour times either.  Would I go here again?  Possibly. It wasn't bad and I've heard its the best sushi place in town.  It was alright food and sake makes almost everything taste better.  If I'm craving sushi, then yeah, I'll come back, but I may want to explore other foods the next time I visit the area."}
{"text":"MMMM, miso!! and the tunacado - what?!?! so good!!! It's a bit spendier than other places, but always delicious and good happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"We actually barely ate while we were at RA. We went for a SpyOnVegas event for unlimited Sapporo from 6-9 pm. Well they ran out of Sapporo at 8 but that didn't matter because we were already tipsy from slamming Sapporos. There were 7 of us and we decided to get a table to do a little more drinking and eating. I stuck to sake and Sapporo but from the looks of everyone's food and smiling faces, I took it that they were happy. We were being loud and obnoxious and our waitress looked a little irked at first but then became really nice after a little while. She probably realized that the more drinking we did equaled a bigger bill which in turn equaled a bigger tip for her.  I'd go back to try the food so I can post a proper review of the food next time :)"}
{"text":"Been there many times. Really love the food and the atmosphere. Always great customer service which is most important to me overall. I hope it continues and not lose it. It would be great to maybe open up one on the west valley =)"}
{"text":"Good for drinks only, food tasted horrible.  How can you mess up on teriyaki chicken?! It tasted like plastic, and they the staff didnt even do anything about it when asked to change it. Horrible."}
{"text":"Worst sushi place we have ever been too. Sushi was frozen. There was no wasabi or ginger unless asked many times.  The rolls were fishy. They did not clear plates. Hoping we don't get sick."}
{"text":"The sushi was pretty decent here and we tried multiple different rolls that they had. The Hot Miso Soup is definitely different and I think next time we will stick with the regular Miso Soup. The SeaWeed Salad was great and fairly good sized. The only issue we had with this place and why I gave it such a low star rating is how loud the music is. I read that it was loud in there on other reviews, but people really aren't kidding. My wife and I were sitting right next to one another and still felt we had to yell to speak to one another. If you are looking for a nicer, quiter setting then I would go with Stingray Sushi in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Not very impressed by this place. I came here to meet a friend for happy hour (drinks and dinner). The prices were not what I expected for happy hour, very pricey! We felt rushed by the server even though we were continuously ordering food and drinks. Might try it out again since it is a fun restaurant with a nice outdoor area."}
{"text":"This place is very consistent, guaranteed to suck every single time!  Service is horrible, drinks not refilled even after asking several times, tons of mistakes with our order, waitresses seriously need some hearing aids. Food is consistently disgusting! Not a single item we ordered was eatable.   -VOMIT-"}
{"text":"Ra'ckin shrimp are just that.  The sauce is super duper ginger heaven.  Sushi was also very good and happy hour prices were a welcome change from the typical Vegas prices."}
{"text":"On the last night of our Vegas trip, my boyfriend and I was relieved to finally go to a REAL sushi restaurant (away from the buffets and fusion restaurants!). The place was dimly lit and reminded me of a trendy sushi place we have in Fresno, CA. Since we came during the last hour of business, the service was great and the food came out promptly. There was a fairly big party there as well, but seemed like everybody's orders were unaffected by them.   If I remembered correctly, our bill came out to about $70 - average price of sushi for a couple with big appetites. I would probably go here again if I'm craving sushi!!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for happy hour!  A lot of options, not to mention the new shrimp lettuce wraps that are just absolutely delicious. The flavours are unexpected for a sushi placebut work very well together. Hoping they keep them as it was on the seasonal menu!"}
{"text":"We had dinner last night and I need to confirm that this venue still suffers with a lack of good service and appears to have a revolving door of managers which have little concern for patrons.  The once small chain which was the very best has lost it's vision!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  One meal was delivered at least 15 minutes after the other 4 and then the manager (? -some random guy who stopped by) wanted to argue about time stamps on the order and such.  Also put his hand on my shoulder while instructing me.  Very unprofessional."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time and never had bad service until today. The hostess was less than friendly and so was our server. I took my sister there for her birthday and we were disappointed in the way our sever didn't pay attention to us or do anything for her birthday. My roll was also cut awkwardly.. So bummed out"}
{"text":"Overall good experience. I had sake and another table mate had sake sangria, both were tasty. We ordered tapas style, shared and chatted about everything. We ordered nigiri, and all was fresh tasting. They carry tamari which is great for me and my gf needs. Ordered edamame, great starter. Our tapas consisted of: hand rolled sushi, seaweed salad, nigiri, edamame, and Spring rolls. Our waitress was helpful, but it was really busy.   Will come again."}
{"text":"I usually love coming to the Dana Park Ra location. But unfortunately tonight may have been my last time coming here. Upon recieving our food order, a cook walked behind the bar to clock out and proceeded to tell the patrons seated at the bar, \"F*** you guys.\" while flipping us off and ranting about his long work week. I was not the only patron visibly upset and taken back by his actions and remarks."}
{"text":"Warm beer. Weird tasting  green tea Brown salmon, still  connected,  maybe cut with a butter knife,  and  veins! Gross Overly pepper short ribs.  I get one date  with my husband every 6 months these days,  thanks for an awful time, RA.  The Rolls are good, but all your healthier options were awful.  Truly. Didn't tell our server bc  she was nice and didn't want to damper her night."}
{"text":"Close to work so I walked over for lunch.  Got the salmon bento box.  Also tried a signature sushi dish.    Bento box was American size portions of slaw salad, lettuce salad, white rice and salmon in bed of green onions, carrots bell pepper and sauce.  Except for the rice this is a very diabetic friendly meal.  Much more quantity than I needed.  But I ate it all.    Sushi was fried crab roll with avocado and fried shrimp on top.  Sushi and some miso soup would have been plenty for lunch.    I will be adding Ra to my regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"Not so much. I had been looking forward to going to this sushi spot forever and it was a disappointment. I didn't care for the service or ambiance at all. It's 11am on a Friday--do we really need to blast Calvin Harris at nightclub-level volumes?  I exaggerate, but it was loud for a place that had no business yet. The server was a woman around my age who knew that my table of females, ranging in age from 23-65, wasn't going to flirt with her to give her extra money. Water glasses sat empty, portions of the order were forgotten, and we weren't told about specials. Finally, it took around 30 minutes after we were done eating to get our check. Our server would ask a question, and before we would have time to answer, she would already be stepping away.   We ordered a few rolls to share and vegetable tempura. The asparagus in the tempura was excellent, as was the avocado mini-roll, but everything else (coupled with the less-than-stellar service) was just meh.   We left without much of an inkling to go back. Sorry, Ra, you failed to win me over!"}
{"text":"Love this place, sushi has always been delicious, love the Las Vegas roll. Always order some the pineapple cream cheese wontons, they're yummy! Had an awesome waiter on Sunday night, was funny and always had out drinks filled, even when he accidentally dropped our plate he managed to make light of the situation, which is a nice change from Waiters that will usually get mad. Bathrooms were clean, and the music was loud but it was fun music so we didn't mind it at all, overall I love this place:)"}
{"text":"The sushi is good here but the people watching is the real reason to make a stop here.  It is a mandatory stop for me and my friends every year when we are in town to see the Giants in spring training.  It's right in the middle of Old Town Scottsdale and walking distance to surrounding bars and clubs."}
{"text":"We were looking for some good food before leaving town and had wanted to try Ra on the previous trip. Mid afternoon on a Monday and the service was still slow, really slow. No deafening music though. The sushi was overpriced but it was still tasty Mexican sushi. It is \"Good for Kids\" in the day time, minus the slutty looking hostess."}
{"text":"RA is to sushi what date rape is to romance."}
{"text":"I've been to this Ra about 10 times and they've been mostly good (3.5 star) experiences. This last visit a friend and I went on a Sunday at 6:30 thinking it was happy hour but were informed it didn't start until 8.   It was pretty dead, but we were stuck in a back corner nonetheless, probably because we were two dudes on a man date rather than two women (who presumably must be on a lesbian date).  We ordered a bunch of nigiri, but it took 40 minutes to arrive (we were told  there was a big group somewhere, but I didn't see them). Also, the pieces were much smaller than I ever remember seeing, both narrower and not as thick as respectable nigiri. There was less rice to make it less obvious how dinky each fish piece was. After scarfing my portion down, I was still hungry and had to order potstickers to stave off my hunger (anything else would have taken 20 minutes.)  By the time we were finally done it was approaching 8 and it was starting to fill up with all the young Scottsdale beautiful people. Too bad I was too hungry to wait until 8pm to get half-off on small pieces of sushi."}
{"text":"I ONLY GET SUSHI HERE!  Never tried anything else.  My expierence have been okay. Sometimes I'll get a good waiter/waitress  So its kinda a hit or miss on good quality service. The sushi that is made here is delicious. I recommend going during happy hour. Not worth the prices other than that."}
{"text":"20 mins after being seated at table hostess had to bring us waters and apologize for no service. Finally waitress showed up with bad attitude. Placed order since we could have memorized menu in the time we waited with zero acknowledgement. Took order, came back 8 mins later and said drinks will be coming but bartender is slammed. Meanwhile 5 people at bar and bartender standing taking to guest not making drink. She asked what do we want to do?  That was it. Amazing how poor her service was. Than asked if we wanted manager as she asked how we got our waters. We said hostess has been the only one to give us service. Than as she's asked again if we wanted to wait for drinks and food we ordered rudely, we said forget it we will go next door and she had zero concern.  Go elsewhere. You will opt regret giving ra your money."}
{"text":"Delicious sushi! My favorite place to go and awesome staff! Little expensive for 2 we played $75 for 4 rolls edamame and 2 Misos.... little pricey but still one of my favorite sushi spots! We had an awesome server who kept us laughing!"}
{"text":"Great Place!  I'm from NY so I was skeptical about the sushi in AZ.  It was great...very great.  Yellowtail with ponzu sauce and chili or something like that was amazing.  Good sushi selection too, I recommend one of the Nigori's.  Bartender was very friendly and helpful and made eating at the bare much more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I called to make a reservation to celebrate my bestie's birthday here for happy hour. They don't take reservations. I also learned that no one could sit down until 75% of our party was there. We were expecting 10-12 people so we were able to sit down after the first 7 people arrived (after 20 minutes). It was really crowded. The music was way too loud! We had to shout across the table to talk to each other. The service and food were both good. I'll be back, but in a much smaller group so we don't have to shout to each other."}
{"text":"I'm really not much of a Sushi person. But I have had some OK experiences here in the company of true Sushi lovers.   The staples: Nice atmosphere, exceptional service and concern for your RA experience, Mid-range tasty food.  Like I said, sushi is not my Forte (or my Fiddy), so imma stay in my lane. And, ya know, Darcie doesn't even like seafood... I know, but I love her. So what do we get?   Spicy Shrimp Soup and/or Miso Soup. Both are pretty tasty. RA, however, is very fast and loose with the word spicy (read on).  Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Udon. It's ok, though nothing like you could get in Seattle where there's a Yaki joint on every corner and the competition leads to explosively awesome flavor. Yeah, it's not that. But it's pretty good for the non-Sushi goer. The thing to be aware of with this dish is the Spicy declaration is pure BS. The dish itself is far from spicy, like vanilla-ice-cream-far. The spicy component is actually a decoration on the edge of the bowl lip. If you actually want spicy you have to tell them to make their \"spicy\" dish SPICY. Ridiculous, and makes me want to pay my bill in Monopoly Money in protest to the false advertising. BUT! Now I know. And now you know. I still think it's stupid and it pisses me off to even think about it.   HOWEVER! When I say there is \"exceptional service and concern for your RA experience\", it's over this Ain't-spicy situation. I spoke to the manager about my very non-spicy \"Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Udon\". He explained their design of the dish with its artful perimeter sinusoidal fancification of my bowl lip with \"spicy\" sauce. Sigh. I countered with: \"that Sine wave of red stuff ain't spicy either, and the whole Kit & Caboodle is a misrepresentation of the signature description of the dish.\" I could see he'd been through this customer frustration before. Dude's not evil. He didn't design the menu. He offered to take the order off my bill. And he advised me how to order it in the future to suit my preference and get the desired result from the kitchen. I appreciated his approach to my concerns and waived off his offer to pay for the dish. I count the whole experience as a positive outcome. I wish I could remember the manager's name. Dude knows customer service. We liked him.  I also get Crunchy Shrimp Tempura Roll. That's actual quite tasty.  End of story.  Oh, if you have even been seated on the RA patio and an Explorer or Camry has rolled very slowly by with the driver yelling, \"RrrrrrrrRAAAAAAH!\" at the top of his lungs... Yeah, that's me. Usually with my daughter following club basketball practice. Been doing it at least 5 years. Is it mature? Of course not. Does it give me joy? Hell yeah. Will I stop? Of course not. But the frequency has slowed as my daughter is off in college. But spring break is comin' baby and Imma tunin' up my voice for a truly prodigeous \"RrrrrrrrRAAAAAAH!\" Think I might add some additional r's, R's, and an extra H or three."}
{"text":"Had a ditch day with my daughter and took her here as she has been wanting to try it for a while! Our waitress was super adorable and super attentive! I'm sorry I didn't get her name. The food was amazing the only reason I didn't give it a five-star is the portions are smaller and it is a little bit more on the expensive side."}
{"text":"We went during their Mother's Day happy hour/Sunday happy hour so this might be a little biased when it comes to pricing... But it was probably one of the best sushi places I've ever been to and I have been to A LOT. Definitely great service and great location on the strip. The sesame chicken wings and the rainbow rolls were among our favorites so I'd definitely recommend trying them. Definitely will come back on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm probably banned from life here after trying the sake bombers... enter AngrySakeBarbie.   Scottsdale Ra doesn't really impress me. With so many other sushi choices, it's not a destination of choice. Sushi is bland and not anything to write home about. Service here is average if you can get it.    Happy hour prices are pretty decent if you can get a table and keep the servers from ditching you.  We had a group of six and waited 45 minutes for sushi orders. Empty glasses and no follow up on WTF happened to our order. The sake bombers only made my last season Prada-stomping feet go into overdrive.   Enter at your own Happy Hour risk."}
{"text":"Happy hour with my really, really girlfriend. Shiso Naughty but I'm so good :) I decided to go outside my realm and try a Samurai Cowby. After one, I needed a good ride out of there!  Happy hour specials are really decent for your money's worth (STAR). It starts early (STAR) and has a good selection of sushi, apps and tapas to choose from (prices $2-$7). Get bang for your buck here, yelpers!  Service was okay but borderline mediocre. I guess since they have cheap happy hour, they figure cheap tips are in order. Quelle dommage. I tip well for empty plates being cleared and a consistent glass full of alcohol people :)   They've got a great patio for those months when Arizona is known for its wonderful weather. However, the freeway noise can drowned out conversation as its proximity is mere steps from an exit ramp (THUS THE LACK OF ADDITIONAL STARS)."}
{"text":"RA to me is what Dorsia is to Patrick Bateman. The sushi is \"meh.\" and people go because it's trendy as fleck. I spent most of my experience at the bar, so It's halfway decent as in \"Another Sapporo? Duh.\" (hence the 2 stars). That classic line \"it is what it is\" reeks.. To shed some light, it's a good spot to meet friends before you head to venue #2. I think the only authentic Japanese item in this place was my watch. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"Music is just slightly too loud. Service was good, but not excellent. Prices are fair, especially with the promos. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Good food, but so loud! If you're looking for a bar with food, 4 stars. Looking for a restaurant?  2 stars. Also, they do not accept reservations unless you call 24 hours ahead. Even when they aren't busy. I am 9 months pregnant and don't want to wait a long time once I get there. I asked if we could have reservations for 3 at 6:40 and she said no. I asked if they could make an exception since I am so pregnant, and she said no but there shouldn't be a long wait. If there isn't going to be a long wait, why not just let me make a reservation?"}
{"text":"If you want a great happy hour and great ambiance, come here. If you are in the mood for real sushi, not the cream cheese version served at ra, go to geisha in old town. Geisha has a better happy hour, $1 Sake, and authentic sushi."}
{"text":"I love Ra's happy hour and usually go during those hours (3-7). My favorite roll is the tootsy maki and every now and then I get the pork gyoza. Usually service is pretty fast but nights and weekends are slower. If you check in with foursquare (and maybe other apps) you get a complimentary miso soup or edamame. I would consider this the best sushi place in the ASU area."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I've tried but not the worst either. It's right on the strip by the fashion mall. I like that they have a lot of vegetarian options, they use imitation crab so that's good too (if you're vegetarian). I was very surprised about the prices. For being on the strip and for being sushi I was expecting this place to be overpriced for sure, but NO it's super cheap! I got an appetizer, two rolls, and miso soup and the price was only 30 something dollars! Can you believe that! The inside is dark and decorated nicely. I liked the outside seating better because I could be nosey and people watch. Random fact but the restrooms are really cool. I took like a million selfies in there because it looked so rad. Try this place out."}
{"text":"Went here for nye and finally writing a review the food is so delicious and I couldn't stop ordering the different sushi dishes. The bartender serving us was so nice and did a good job considering how busy it was. I love this place! Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my visit to RA Sushi. I was catching a red eye flight from PHX to DCA, so my friend and I were searching for somewhere to grab dinner before she dropped me off at the airport, and we wandered into RA.  Overall, the sushi was excellent. Fresh, beautifully prepared, and we were excited to find that we had walked in during their Sunday evening happy hour, so the prices were reasonable.  The tuna tataki was AMAZING!! The onion soy vinaigrette was delectable, and the tuna was incredibly fresh and PERFECTLY seared. For real. I could eat their tuna tataki three meals a day, it was that good.  Would have given them 5 stars if it weren't for the service. All the employees were friendly and helpful, but towards the end of our meal, we were in a bit of a rush to leave for the airport, and it seemed like it took 30 minutes just to pay our check.  Overall, though, I'll definitely return. And when I do, I will likely get 5 orders of the tuna tataki!!"}
{"text":"First off, I am going to start this post by stating that RA needs to open a location in Denver.  I don't understand why there are multiple locations throughout Tucson, AZ, but none in the whole state of Colorado.  With that being said, I absolutely love RA.  It is in my top 5 favorite sushi restaurants of all time. They have excellent service, great happy hour prices and amazing sushi.  I have taken someone who didn't even like sushi to try RA,and they became a fan. Literally. Open one in Denver!!!  I always rant and rave about this place. I don't think I can say enough great things.  This time, we stopped in to the Vegas location across from the Wynn Hotel. This location is a bit tough to get to, but well worth the trek. We ordered off the happy hour menu and really couldn't decide, so we actually ordered entirely way too much food. We started with the calamari, which I had never had there.  It was lightly battered in tempura batter.  I would suggest getting this if you are sharing for a table of 4 or more.  The dish was a pretty large portion. It was good, but I am not sure if we would order it again based on the size. It is usually just my fiance and I.  Then we added the shishito peppers, which is one of my all time favs. We have ordered these at other restaurants and no one can replicate these to be anywhere near as great as RA. We then got the egg rolls and the gyoza. Both equally as tasty, just a ton of food. By that time, we should have stopped ordering, but, we needed to get some sushi.  Bring on the yellowtail! Yellowtail is my favorite fish and RA does it right. Soaking in ponzu sauce and topped with jalapenos, this dish will surely make your taste buds tingle. Top it off with more yellowtail and I was set for the day. I seriously just wish that they would open a location in Colorado.  The state will be very happy if they did."}
{"text":"This is definitely a place you go to when you're short on cash, craving for sushi, want to meet up with some friends, and not expecting too much in regards to quality or service.  It's a pretty trendy place with a dj and cool atmosphere during happy hour on Sunday nights.  But if you're looking for good, quality sushi I would not recommend this place.  If you're looking to just satisfy a sushi craving for low bucks during happy hour, this place is for you!  Great place for people-watching and the drinks are pretty good.  Oh, and if it's your birthday, they'll bring you a tempura ice cream dish for free..enough for 4 or more! :)"}
{"text":"Terrible service and come here often...always empty drink and wait 20 min was there only lunch and they should have more help or focus more"}
{"text":"White Peach Sangria is delicious!!! Bartender is phenomenal, definitely recommend for happy hour drinks. However I wouldn't recommend for happy hour sushi, it's very basic. The RArripop is my favorite item on the menu. The Las Vegas roll is decent, however I'm not a fan of fried food. I had the rainbow roll on happy hour, and it's a basic rainbow roll. Great place to get some dinner before headed out for the night."}
{"text":"RA's happy hour = awesome! CHEAP and it satisfied my sushi cravings.   Don't do the Kirin + sake unless you WANT a bad headache. LOL  Great location. They need more TVs though."}
{"text":"Great service sushi came out quickly all very tasty my favorite was the scallop dynamite roll. The garlic edamame was very good as was the tempura vegetables. Vegas roll was on point as was the tuna tataki."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this RA.  I have eaten many times at the RA downtown San Diego and a few times in Scottsdale.  This location I have tried 3 times.  The rolls are good but pricy. The last time i was there the roll was super fishy smelling and not good.  Today I had a bento box lunch special and the chicken teriyaki was so freezer burned and dry it was practically un-edible.  I had two pieces and quit.  The rest of the box wasn't fresh.  The salad was rusted and bruised and the potsticker was old and dried out.  I give them a solid \"F\" on this box.  Atmosphere is nice, the service is good and attentive.  Overall, for the price, I will go someplace else."}
{"text":"My brother and his girlfriend had told me this place was good and that I would really like it. So, for dinner one of the nights I was in Vegas this past weekend we decided to eat here. Between me and one other person we shared the pineapple cream cheese wontons appetizer which was really good. We then ordered 5 items to share. Yellowtail Ceviche with jalapeno, tiny tempura bits, cilantro, and a really yummy chili ponzu garlic sauce. Sliced Ahi Tuna with avocado and a dipping sauce for that too. Tootsie Maki roll, beef tataki roll, and the new zealand roll. All of them were really good. Even the New Zealand roll which was made with smoked salmon (I'm not a fan of salmon). Not cheap but not extremely expensive. I would definitely come back here again for sushi if I was in Vegas. Also, they have this really good dessert. Fried tempura coated Cinnamon ice cream with chocolate and raspberry sauce. Yum!!!  As for the service, our server was great. The food came out really quick and since we were a party of 11, she got everything right even for the picky ones in the group."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Cold beer. Fantastic service. The bartender did not shake my margarita. Not cool. My server was fantastic. Took care of my needs and was patient too!  Lobster shrimp  roll and shrimp calami tempura roll were the best."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant, good food, SLOW SLOW SLOW Service.  Went there with a group, and the food was all good but the service wasn't great. I ordered Chicken Katsu before the rest of the group ordered tons of Sushi...the Sushi came out slow, but no one cared. And then I realized we had been there 2.5 hours and I still didn't have my Chicken Katsu - I asked the waiter about it and he had totally forgot. I eventually got my food but everyone else was done eating - he was apologetic and we got a free dessert but it just sucked for me since I don't eat sushi..."}
{"text":"Let's be honest. You don't come to RA sushi bar to get fresh sushi or sashimi. You come here for the insane happy hour... and the atmosphere. They really have one of the best happy hour deals on appetizers, small plates, and drinks. Plus it always seems to be the hopping place to be!"}
{"text":"The hostesses are rude and consistently provide miserable service.  Their wait staff isn't much better, but after dealing with the hostesses your service expectations are pretty low.  Their food is usually pretty good and it seems like a good place for novice sushi-goers to ease in to the world of raw fish.  My least favorite thing on the menu is the Crispy Spicy Tuna.  Only had this once, but it was pretty much a rock hard ball of fried rice with spicy tuna piled on top.  Pretty odd and not so tasty.  With that said, their other specialty rolls are delicious.  Bottom line: Their convenient location and happy hour menu keeps me coming back, but I would love to see the management improve their service standards."}
{"text":"The chirashi bowl is good and at a very good price. I usually eat 5 or 6 rolls, but the chirashi bowl and one roll is usually enough to fill me up.  Nice having tvs in the bar to watch football."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful for sushi and at a decent price as well. Their happy hour is awesome. Half-off a lot of their appetizer and sushi as well. Their Vegas and Shrimp rolls are delicious. I literally could eat my weight in that. Their service is amazing too and she seemed knowledgeable in anything related to sushi so we followed up to her recommendation as well and loved all of it. Their desert is wonderful as well. Definitely will come here a lot more often."}
{"text":"Spent the week in Las Vegas for work and had a few hours to kill before my wife had to go back home we found them using Yelp and WOW this is definitely a place we will return to next trip. The ra'ckin salsa is outstanding and the service was great. We plan on going back with family next trip and we will be stopping here."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to Ra Sushi for the first time. Our waitress informed us that she was training a waiter and that he would be over to take our order. The waiter was very nice and helpful and advised that we try there dynamite scallop roll. We ordered a dynamite roll, a chili shrimp roll and some sort of sushi bowl. My husband's sushi bowl came out first and 30 minutes later the manager brought us a dynamite scallop appetizer. We informed him that we ordered the dynamite scallop roll. Instead of apologizing he took the plate and briskly walked off. My husband and I both thought that his reaction was rude. We waited another 15 minutes and no sign of either roll. It doesn't take steak that long to cook, why would we wait that long for sushi? We tried to get the attention of our waitress but she was too busy chatting with someone at the bar. Our baby was getting tired/fussy so we asked the hostess for the check. We saw her inform our waitress and she didn't come out until the hostess asked her again 10 minutes later. She came out with our sushi to go and said that we would not be charged for the sushi. She stated that she wasn't sure that the waiter entered our order however, if you're \"training\" someone aren't you supposed to monitor them/help them to ensure that they are doing things correctly? We paid for our sushi bowl and wine and left, not one appearance from said manager to apologize for their mistake. Either way, we won't be back."}
{"text":"So I could be crucified for this review by true sushi enthusiasts, but I can't help it, I just liked this place.  Went here with my sister when she was in town, and it was great.  Its just a great place to go for those ridiculous rolls with a million ingredients.  I know that isn't \"authentic\" or it would be considered \"Americanized,\" but, hey, if you like Americanized sushi, you won't be disappointed at Ra Sushi.  They master some great flavor combinations, beautiful presentation, and yum fish."}
{"text":"The food here is decent. And I would come here again. The downsides are that they made us wait outside for our group of  8 and when we went inside it was completely empty so they didn't need to make us wait.   The up sides are that the food is pretty tasty. I like that each peice of a roll would easily fit in your mouth. The catch is that you have to order more food to feel satisfied.   The tempura fried ice cream was yummy. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"love this bartenders and happy hours. must stop when you sick paying too expensive drink at vegas!"}
{"text":"I don't understand what's to complain about with this place, ahem, previous reviewers!  Well, maybe because I went during Ra's Happy Hour Specials time, but I have to say, I was thoroughly impressed by their cheap appetizers and drinks!  My coworkers and I sat at the bar, amused by the waitress' t-shirts and the free condom \"matchbooks\" sitting in a huge fish bowl.  My tastebuds were immediately interested in the crispy spicy tuna roll.  This roll was effin fantastic.  I mean, literally, a mouth orgasm happened in front of my coworkers.  I mean, just because of this roll, I have to give this place four stars.  I also had the lobster spring rolls, which weren't as amazing as the crispy spicy tuna roll, but not horrible either.  Drinks were fabulous and my overall bill for two appetizers and two drinks was only $19.  Not too shabby, compared to other sushi places!  I wish this place existed in the Bay Area."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness , the baked scallop dynamite wowwwwwww !!!! Amazing , fresh , delicious !!! The server Brittany is just fantastic !! Super adorable , friendly , attentive , very knowledgable of the menu and we never needed a refill!!! This restaurant is soooooo cute and classy right on the strip and it's not always too busy to get in and out !!! Get and ask for Brittany !"}
{"text":"I've been to this RA before I was a yelper..and every time around this place never disappoints me.  This joint is our  must come for a quick fix type of place for us because we just love the tasty treats here.  It's the same as the one in Tustin on redhill location, but  dining in RA vegas, just seems alittle more fun.  I'm a little guilty for enjoying the non-vegan dishes this time...but like I said it's hard being vegan at vegas especially trying to be fair about the places and choices of food to eat with your partner.    So I will just make this quick.  Very nice setting as usual...I love munching in the low dim glow of red lights all over, it's very intimate and makes the time more enjoyable.  Our waitress was very pretty by the way...I was drawn to her natural beauty...something we hardly see in vegas/employees.   We got the chicken yakisoba which was mediocre. Only got it because of the veggies and noodles in it.  I love rolls...so we had over 5 different orders of rolls, and to me they all taste the same everywhere..cheap or expensive it taste the same.  The appetizers, this is a must order; the lobster spring roll. That was my favorite of all dishes.  It's lobster rolled up in fried thinly crisped wonton paper mixed with mango, cream cheese, & mild peppers.  It's the tastiest lobster roll I've ever had so I savored every morsel of it. lol because it was that good!  Comes in about 4 or 5 pieces so order more than 1 plate. The racklin shrimp was also a delight.  It's a crispy crumby type of shrimp that is placed on top of green lettuces that you dip into ginger teriyaki sauce.  Very very tasty.  I enjoyed it muchos.   Cinnamon tempura ice cream was such an indulgence for my sweet tooth.  The green tea ice cream was okay.  I don't really drink alcohol so I tried their strawberry ginger lemonade.  It taste like strawberry sprite. So it's a nay for me. One of the items we got was in a happy hour menu so we got about $5 off our bill.  If you're wondering, I did finish everything in my giant size stomach.  My partner and I finished everything.  Let's just say we had to walk it off for the remainder of the night.  Total: you're absolutely full & everything was worth every penny."}
{"text":"This place has sort of redeemed itself, but only because of the awesome bartender.  It's been about a year since I was last at Ra, and they sent me a $20 half birthday coupon.  Can could I turn down free food?  Stopped by to grab a couple rolls and notice they remodeled their place.  It's definitely better, as I can now actually read my menu at the bar unlike before (it was too dark).  Hands down, I caught a good day as Lauryn the bartender only works one day a week.  She is awesome.  Friendly but doesn't take her job too seriously, and was witty enough to ask me if my sushi was \"uninventive\" after I quoted my own Yelp review 10 minutes earlier.  One nice addition is reasonably priced craft beers.  I had a Lagunitas Little Sumpin' for $5.50, which was definitely unexpected.  The two rolls I had were the Spicy Lobster Roll and the Zonie Roll.  The sushi was still just OK, but pretty unmemorable.  I'm still going to stick to my local AYCE spots for the same price as 2 1/2 rolls."}
{"text":"I don't know what's more annoying the loud music that they play here or the girl I used to go here with.  Sushi is good yet over-priced. Also had a negative experience here when watching the world cup and told bar tender I didn't want the USA to win and that I'd rather see Brazil win. Didn't understand that episode.  Wouldn't return (but if you join their email list they send you a $20 gift certificate on your half birthday so Yeah I'm still on their email list and would return to another location)"}
{"text":"Ra Rocks.. the food is great and the atmosphere is really laid back, relaxed, trendy.  A great place that is not in a casino. I go to LV a lot for work and we go there every time we are there.  The waitresses are always really cool and chatty which is a plus.  The Sake Sangria Rocks.  The only downside if any is that the music is sort of blaring....sometimes thats goo for a fun atmosphere but at times we found it annoying because it clashed with the Mexican place next to it"}
{"text":"Viva Las Vegas roll is the best ! And the strawberry lemonade is bomb .. Best place to go for happy hour. Can't beat the price, especially on the strip."}
{"text":"Had a reservation for 7:15 and it took over 45 minutes to get seated. Once seated, it took an additional 30 minutes to get cocktails and water.   When we ordered appetizers, all three of them came out at separate times and it was so slow. Our server was really nice about it, but the kitchen was way too busy. We then ordered 6 rolls which took about an hour to come out. After receiving the rolls, it took another 40 minutes to receive the very last roll.  Overall, the food was average, but we spent 3 1/2 hours at the restaurant. I would never come back to this restaurant, it is by far the worst service I have ever had in my life."}
{"text":"First thing FIRST, I'm from Chicago; I love RA. BUT I've been on vacation here in Arizona since June. Visited here many times. The few times I've come to RA during my visit, Chanelle was my server. I love her to DEATH! But when I came back, she was no longer here! WHY!? I don't understand because my server this time was terrible. Smh. I wish you guys would hire her again. Your food is ALWAYS good. So that makes it comes down to the customer service. Chanelle was the best you guys had. Big mistake. But nonetheless, the edamame and the sake bombs were perfection as always. 2 stars for good food. But -3 for not having Chanelle and the terrible server! If you don't care about service, come to this loco... Otherwise :((((("}
{"text":"Yiikes. Unless you've never tried sushi before in your life, and this is the only place that serves it within a 100 mile radius, then be my guest. Ra definitely serves up a trendy atmosphere and great service, but those factors alone are not enough to mask their below par food. This is definitely an Americanized sushi place where rolls take the stage, but were quite disappointing. We ordered 4 different rolls, and the rainbow roll looked like something my 4 year old cousin could make. The chicken yakitori was incredibly dry, and the yellowtail sashimi was just decent. The most memorable item was the edamame...yes. it was just. that. bad."}
{"text":"RA is normally pretty good but damn this place is a terrible.. Sushi is dry and over cooked. It seems like it was prep the day before and depending what you order they throw it on top...never coming back. Service is good on the upside"}
{"text":"Was in town for spring training and stopped by for an early dinner.  I was not impressed with the cut roll choices; seriously, do ALL rolls have to have cream cheese in them???  Seemed like 8 out of 10 did.  We opted instead for some pot stickers, which I admit were very good, the crab cakes, which were solid but nothing to get in a tizzy about, a roll which I can't remember now because it was that forgettable, and some yellowtail sashimi that was decent.  Overall as a dining experience I guess it was OK, I was just looking for more of a sushi experience.  Agree with others that have said it's ridiculously loud in there, turn the friggin music down!  This a night club or a restaurant?  Eh.  I'll try someplace else next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Ok fine.  I'm gonna admit it.  I haven't eaten the sushi here.  Sure it looks decent, but looks can be deceiving and besides if I wanted Sushi in the area I'd go to Sushi 101 or drive to Tanked Fish.  The real gem here, is that if you order a Sake bomber, they give you a chilled pint glass, a vile (er.. vial) of warm, not overly impressive sake, a sake cup and a gigantic Japanese beer.  You can get about 4 shots out of a seven dollar drink which is probably the best deal going on Mill.  This was right after the U of A / ASU game so it was packed.  Some guys who worked sales for some company I've never heard of in Scottsdale were nice enough to let us share their table outside.  Mr. T, JC and myself stuck to Sake Bombers.  B is apparently too delicate a flower to wipe beer foam off her chin so she settled in with an Appletini which looked pretty and which she said was decent.    During the two rounds we spent here, some guy was acting the fool over by the Mission Palms hotel behind the joint and we were all treated to some splendid pepper spray aroma therapy courtesy of Tempe's Finest.  If you're looking to get swervy without spending it like a Sultan down on Mill, Ra's sake bombers will get you there and that alone is worth 3 stars."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour and ordered a fantastic strawberry seasonal cocktail. Awesome service from our lady bartender who recommended the pineapple wontons, they were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This is one of times I wish i read reviews. The service was terrible. ANd here's why. We got a long with our server and he was attentive at first, but when I still didn't get my seared Tuna he disappeared. Finally flagged down management who said they were gonna check on it.  I hate complaining, i just wanted food. When I got it, they told me it was comp'd. :) So I ordered a plethora of Sake and my night, was instantly better ( the hot sake was 2 dollars but man, you don't get much for it)  The place is sexy no doubt. I just wished I didn't have to watch everyone else get their food before me, even though I had been there longer. :("}
{"text":"The food is decent, (but far from the best around) the service is good, but I should not need to shout to a person 18\" from my face at a sit down dinner. There is absolutely no reason for a place that is not a dance club to have music so intolerably loud. It made the whole experience a great deal worse."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!! All of the bartenders are really friendly and personable. One of the bartenders made us some amazing shots! Clean, fun atmosphere. Great for hanging out with friends or a date night."}
{"text":"Delirious from hunger and unable to think straight I let my daughter talk me into the worst decision I've made in quite sometime.   We ordered a Tempura & California Roll Lunch Combo plus a tootsy maki and a tuna avocado roll rolled in toasted sesame seeds.   The tempura arrived, everything was barely crisp, a tad greasy but otherwise somewhat edible.   When we got our sushi rolls it was apparent with one look that they were total crap, however, starving as we were we decided to carry on and eat.   Tootsy Maki= DooDoo Kaki!   Don't be fooled by the long wait, they are not making these fresh to order.  This was definitely a roll that was prepped and pre-rolled last night!  The seaweed was chewy and slimy, the dried up rice almost broke my tooth and the crab mixture was like eating mayo that sat out over night.   My Tuna and Avocado roll which I asked specifically to be rolled in TOASTED SESAME SEEDS, was no better with it's also chewy seaweed and RAW Sesame Seeds, I didn't order a  damn big mac. WTF!   The California roll that arrived lastly with the salad was the same kind of pre-rolled crap. We ended up leaving it.   Unfortunately I had to pay for this shit, but made sure to thank the sushi guys for the worst sushi I've ever eaten and let them know that I knew they  had served us pre-rolled crap, and of course they had nothing to say but \"have a nice day\"!   *vomits*"}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie. When my best friend brought me here and I saw there was no AYCE and peculiar menu items with ingredients I'm not really into, I made her walk me to Segundo next door but they were closed.  Alas we went back into RA Sushi and I gave the menus another hopeful glance. Despite the large number of items I would never order without somehow deviating, such as the inclusion of mango in an otherwise delightful sounding tempura roll, I miraculously found two dishes that will for sure bring me back:  The edamame dip, for starters. I'm a classic edamame lover and when I saw this, I knew I had to give it a try. The chips they provided with it looked a little too few at first so I majorly dipped my first handful and the dip itself was amazing. If you like tart spinach dip with a little bit of a sweet pickle flavour, then I definitely recommend this appetizer. And it turned out I should have been less generous with my first chips because I had chips left over as I was practically scraping the bowl clean!  Next was the calamari tempura roll. When you see it's rotating red and green colouring a from I assume the tempura crumbs, it looks like Christmas! It tasted pretty good, a little bland in flavour just because of the calamari and the cream cheese was a little overwhelming at the same time. It was OK.  I saved Lobster Shrimp Roll for last because it is simply the best. I don't believe I've ever had lobster in my sushi before but the combination of it with shrimp, avocado, crab mix, and rice was AMAZING. I was so impressed by it that I ordered it a second time, I just couldn't help myself!  I did spend a hefty $50 but granted it was a late Friday night with no happy hour but my taste buds justified it so it was well worth it. The service was okay, our server was very nice and polite but didn't bring wasabi for my friends Philadelphia roll and somehow forgot my iced tea would require sugar so we had to flag him down two separate times. Overall, nice atmosphere GREAT food and I wouldn't mind my next trip being soon but cheaper!!"}
{"text":"I'm in town for work and staying at the Tempe mission. On my last night, I thought I'd give this restaurant a try since I'm craving for Japanese food. I called and placed my ordered  for pick up and they said it'll be ready in 20mins. I decided to walk over a little early to check out the place. As soon as you walk in, you will see the bar and few tables- very nice decor, modern and hip. Unfortunately I didn't get any drinks, maybe next time. But the food was so good! I ordered pork gyoza, miso soup, black pepper sirloin with asparagus and rice. My favorite dish was the asparagus, that was amazeballs! Definitely recommend this place and hope I get to visit Tempe again- this will be the place I'll be having dinner and drinks!"}
{"text":"Overpriced, even during happy hour. All rolls taste the same. Great atmosphere, but I'd rather pay less and have better tasting sushi at an all you can eat place."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay, drinks tasted horrible. Server was fantastic! The sushi chefs were very friendly."}
{"text":"Ra Sushi is just your basic average sushi joint. Nothing really special about this place. The sushi here is mediocre at best. We came around 930pm on a Sunday, and the place wasn't that crowded. Their service is very poor and slow. We had to ask many times for water refills, and they even forgot to bring out the wasbi and ginger for our sashimi and rolls. Let's start with the good stuff. Yellowtail sashimi was the only best dish of the nite. The cuts were perfect and thick. It's wasn't the best,but it pass. Viva Vegas Roll how can they like this. The roll barely had any spicy tuna mostly imitation crab,and it was to sweet for my taste buds. Crispy Onion Albacore was a mess on the plate. The albacore looked like it was cut by a dull knife. Plus they drowned it with so much ponzi sauce were you couldn't taste the fish anymore. Tropical Roll was ok. It was something different. Great presentation but no Wow factor there. The only reason it made it to 3 star instead of 2 is because of the yellowtail sashimi was good.Other than that there's better places to get your sushi fix."}
{"text":"Sushi was good, however, the waitstaff spent most of the the time gossiping and doing hair.  Service was ok, but hostess was patronizing and not happy to be in the service industry."}
{"text":"I was highly disappointed. My friend and I were staying at a hotel down the street and wanted a dessert at 11:15pm. We checked Ra's website and it said they were still serving food until Midnight so we wandered down and got there a little before 11:30pm.   First, there was music blasting so loud that I could barely hear the hostess at the door, and it was bad rap/techno blends. Then the hostess tells us that they will be closing the food soon so to go to the bar area. So my friend and I wander over to the bar which was right next to the DJ, and the bar was completely full so we sat down at a table about 5 feet away. There was people with menus and food at tables either side of us, so we thought no big deal.   10 minutes go by, of waiters and waitresses, 3 of them for 2 tables, ordering and cleaning up the rest. We finally snagged one, and asked if we could order. She just rolled her eyes and said they were closing down, and walked away. Finally the Hostess came over, got our orders for 2 creme brulees, so easy to do, and brought us waters. The next 20 minutes, we sat there, totally ignored by the wait staff, even as they walked right by us, until my friend went to talk to the hostess again, who found our creme brulees and brought them to us. The only time the wait staff willing interacted with us was when it was time to pay and my friend got up with the bill fold to pay at the bar with it.   Needless to say, we didn't leave a tip.   The only reason I am giving them 2 stars at all, is the Hostess did her best to make sure we got our dessert, and coconut vanilla creme brulee was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Located in the Fashion Show Mall with a great view of the Strip.  Head here for happy hour before you start the club rounds.  It's a great place to hang out for some half price sushi & sake after shopping in the mall for a great dress to wear out to Pure or XS.  Plenty of indoor & outdoor seating, friendly servers & low lighting to set the mood for your crazy night ahead."}
{"text":"Fashion Mall is not exactly the first place one would look for a place to eat, but while looking for a not too expensive place where to eat sushi in Vegas we found RA.... and we ended up eating there twice in 6 days.  Choice is good and there are some interesting rolls which I never expected to find in a sushi restaurant. For everyone going there do not miss the Viva Las Vegas roll!  A place where you can fill up on good sushi without spending a fortune."}
{"text":"Very nice sushi place I mean it looks great, its good but nothing special about it. I mean u can find this type of food and taste anywhere... nothing to get crazy about. Services was ok Food was good Price was  ok"}
{"text":"Love sushi but I cannot claim to be an expert.  I like this place.  Like it dont love it.  Sometimes the sushi is simply amazing. sometimes it just insnt.  They always refill my drink quick which is cool.    This place is kind of pretentious and it really shouldnt be. Yes it is upscale and overpriced but it is in Ahwatukee on the border of Tempe.  Not N. Scottsdale.  Its fun though. I really enjoy myself when I go and it is not bad for meeting some people of all kinds at and around the bar.  Staff is filled with hot chicks but the bartender who is the manager also can turn the music up WAY too loud.  She kind of gives the tough shit look to the custies.  Good social spot, ok food."}
{"text":"I came here March 26 because I love Sushi. I was very disappointed in the service. We had a blonde woman server, Jenny, and she hardly came to our table. Soup was cold and I had to reach over to the next empty table to get soy sauce. Food was good, just hope you don't get Jenny."}
{"text":"Love this place beautiful food presentation,  wonderful service well executed dishes great ambiance, followed up with a great bar;-D"}
{"text":"RA has a great happy hour beverage selection. Their sparkling white peach sangaria is VERY good. For food we ordered the spring rolls, a bit greasy but the mustard dipping sauce adds a lot of flavor. For sushi we got the crunchy calamari roll (ONLY recommend if you like cream cheese in your sushi, lots of it), the las vegas roll (delicious), and the spicy tuna. Las vegas had the best flavor and we look forward to returning to try additional rolls!   If you are going on a Friday for happy hour, try to get there before 6 if your schedule allows it or you will be waiting a bit for a table."}
{"text":"I would like to give this restaurant 5 stars because the sushi and drinks are so good. However, I had a bad waitress who obvi couldn't handle having a big table. She kept forgetting drinks and only got half the tables orders before leaving and then would disappear for 20 minutes. I would still love to come back here again tho because it's so affordable, great ambience, awesome food (esp their garlic herb edamame and different sushi rolls)."}
{"text":"I ordered from Postmates 2 California Rolls and when I received my order they were not California Rolls, some other kind of sushi. I called the restaurant directly and they apologized multiple times and was extremely nice. I drove down to the location to pick up the correct order and they completely refunded my $50 order. Gave me 3 California Rolls instead of 2, a free Peanut Butter Brownie, and was able to keep the wrong order. Oh.. my.. gosh! I haven't had this kind of awesome service EVER. Also, to top it off.. BEST CALIFORNIA ROLLS   definitely ordering from RA Sushi Bar Restaurant on Val Vista again! :)"}
{"text":"I wish I could give no star for this place !  I are there today with my mom we had the salmon smoky roll It had a BONE in it that my mom choke on it, I called the manger and had to wait for the lady.. I got up and show that bone to the sushi guy told him\" my mom could choke to death from it.. he was mumbling \" could day\" and was laughing!! If I wasn't there with my three-month-old daughter I was punching this guy in the face!!!  Shush I place can not get any worse then that! A shame!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it's because this location is on Mill Avenue, but I've had better. The sushi is average, the prices are higher than normal, and the service is poor.  We called ahead to schedule a larger group and the hostess told us she \"didn't accept reservations\" but that she'd consider it. Ummmm, okay? When we arrived, we still had to wait 20+ minutes for them to prepare the table. Drinks were slow to arrive and poor lighting outside made it awkward to order.  When the food arrived, it was simply lacking. For an upscale sushi joint, I expected to be blown away -- I was far from impressed.  When we were ready to leave, it took 25 minutes for the waiter to bring our check. TWENTY FIVE! A man in our party finally had to hunt him down in order for us to pay and leave.  All in all, I won't return."}
{"text":"Walking along the strip and saw this place and decided to give it a try. Not disappointed! The happy hour menu was extensive and priced nicely. The regular menu was pretty large too. The service was on point and we walked out of there happy and full. Will be going back again!"}
{"text":"Ahi ahi ahi poke. This is where I get my sushi fix. Their Seared Ahi Tuna is very good, its like the NY steak of fish, and here they serve it with avocado and an amazing sauce. The Cali rolls and avocado rolls are good too."}
{"text":"My wife, mom, and two daughters and I had dinner here last night after getting their Halloween costumes at the new Disney store in the Fashion Show Mall.  This was not our first choice, but we all had a good time.  The food was great.  The kids enjoyed chicken katsu and rice, and the table shared miso soup, terryiaki chicken, wantons with pineapple/cream cheese, Gyoza, baked scallops, vegas roll, lobster/shrimp roll, and shrimp tempura rolls.  The food was good.  The problem with this place is the music.  Way to LOUD.  In fact, I think they are an OSHA violation away from being closed down; their employees could file a complaint.  When we arrived, the music was so loud I could not talk to the person sitting next to me without shouting.  I guarantee the music is over the decibels allowed by law.  Not kid friendly, but kid doable."}
{"text":"I've been coming to RA for years and the foods pretty good. It's a great spot for happy hour and a night out with friends. This location in particular gets really loud on weekend nights which is why I gave 4 stars. I know nothing can be done about it, it's old town. If you're looking for a nice dinner where you can hear the other person talking this is NOT the spot on weekends. But if you're looking for a spot with friends to grab drinks and have something light to eat it's pretty good for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible. I should've known better then to go here as i tried the one in Chicago on State St once and I never went back.  If you truly know your sushi, go elsewhere. This is a pathetic chain with low/poor quality sushi."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best appetizers! Eating here always puts a huge smile on my face! Their shareables and sushis are absolutely delicious, and their service is always great! I love coming here and ordering their garlic edamame! I love it so much that I actually tried making it at home a couple times. Every time I leave here I feel extremely satisfied and full! The prices are a bit high but definitely worth it! The bartenders Jastine and Adam were also awesome and entertaining! This restaurant never disappoints!!"}
{"text":"Not a resident of AZ went to RA to have fun purchased shots for multiple  patrons around us, sat outside and was having a wonderful time with my husband to be. I was told we need to calm down despite my $120+  tab. I have been in the service industry for years and it was disrespectful. We were the only \"dark\" couple on the patio and I will never visit another RA in my life. If you can't laugh and have a good time maybe the word BAR should be taken out of the name"}
{"text":"I used to live in Las Vegas, and during that time I used to frequent RA.  As a visitor, I dine in once in a while.  However, I can't really say it's as good as it used to be.   Rolls were good. Favorites were the spicy crispy tuna and the viva las Vegas roll.   I came to RA a day before my birthday, and luckily they still gave me a complimentary dessert: deep fried tempura ice cream. It was a huge portion enough to share with 4 people.   The cocktails are delicious. Snake bite was yummy. I'd definitely recommend this sweet, strong drink.    Waitresses were awesome, attentive and friendly - that's a plus.     Location was convenient - The Fashion Show Mall!   Ambiance is black, red and dark. Very normal of hip Japanese trendy spots."}
{"text":"Here for happy hour, it's mediocre at best. The cocktails are way to sweet.  The shrimp tempura roll was cold and soggy.  The gyoza were okay but only luke warm.  The pacific roll was good and the service was friendly."}
{"text":"I would like to have eaten here but they didn't seem to want to serve us.  It was a Monday evening and the restaurant was only 1/3 full.  We were seated for 15+ minutes without anyone acknowledging us.  We even tried to flag down the hostess to find out where our waiter was and she kept walking by.   The music was a little too loud  and the interior was predictable.  I am giving 2 stars b/c I have been to another Ra location and liked their sushi."}
{"text":"Food here is always great! Usually sit at the bar, but I met someone last night at the sushi bar and the service was pretty awful. I believe our server's name was Jessica? I didn't realize who I met sat themselves there so she kindly asked if we had been helped but didn't apologize for no one realizing we hadn't been, she just said there's a host up front and that's the reason we didn't have a server. She then took 10-15 minutes to grab us waters and only asked us if we \"wanted to get some rolls or something\" when she came back and when we said not yet she walked away and didn't even give us a chance to order our drinks. Then, when we did order, she asked if we wanted ginger and wasabi with our sushi but didn't bring it until we had our food for about another 10-15 minutes. It was busy when we first arrived but towards the end of the night there wasn't really any excuses for the delay in service, being a server myself. Oh, and I don't think I saw her smile once while talking to us."}
{"text":"I used to love coming here but ever since Christmas the service is horrible and they don't care for the food. The last time I went there was straw INSIDE MY ROLL I refuse to go to this location go to mill ave location WAY better"}
{"text":"I love RA. Normally I wouldn't choose to go to a chain sushi place but RA is awesome. The Lobster Spring Rolls are amazing.. they used to be on HH back in the day, now they're around $11/12, ouch. But they come with 4 & great for the table. I am a pretty simple person when it comes to sushi - love the Philly roll (also not on HH) & the Tootsy Maki (is on HH). The HH is really good, and until 7 PM!  We came on a Saturday night around 8PM and it was pretty crowded. They told us 30 minutes so we went to the bar to get a drink but it really only ended up being like 10 minutes.  Our waiter (didn't catch his name) was super attentive & nice!  Love the patio!"}
{"text":"Brought in an Email coupon for $20 off.  I gave it to the server before ordering.  Since it was Happy Hour we ordered off the Happy Hour menu.  When the bill came they took off only $10 instead of the $20 printed on the coupon.  The coupons didn't say anything about not using it on Happy Hour items.   This kind of coupon hijinks leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Tell me the rules up front and I am totally willing to follow them, but you can't make new rules after I consume the food.  The food was sub-par.  I don't know if I will ever be back.  It is what it is."}
{"text":"I have been to RA twice now. Was there once for my sister's bday dinner. We were a large group and they were helpful to accomodate the groups needs. I had a great time but somehow I was shocked when the check came out for $80 and I was still hungry-oops.  Second time I went there with some co-workers for the bogo lunch on a tuesday and had a good experience and a much smaller check.  The lunch menu is definitely worth it but I don't think I will go back for dinner again."}
{"text":"Ra Sushi is a good restaurant for people that don't love sushi. I love sushi, but my husband won't eat it. Ra Sushi is one of the few places I can talk him into going to because they have dishes that he will actually enjoy, not just tolerate so that I can gorge on some raw fish...  Usually when I go to Ra it is for lunch. I typically get the sashimi combo for $11... it is 4 pieces each of tuna, salmon and yellowtail and comes with a bowl of rice and miso soup. He always gets the chicken bento box for $8... it comes with miso soup, rice, salad, gyoza and a spring roll. $20 and we both leave full and happy...   I had dinner with Dawn C. last night at Ra Sushi, we had:   Pineapple Cheese Wontons - In a word, amazing.  Grilled Short Ribs - Tasty but I thought they a bit skimpy on the meat, however they are served with wasabi mashed potatoes, very tasty Seared Tuna - Served with a tasty soy based sauce Viva Las Vegas Roll - One of the specialties at Ra   No drinks, and the total was just under $40. Not bad for a dinner on the Strip.   Ra is beautifully decorated and service is usually good, although like most places the busier it gets the slower service becomes. When I come in at lunch, I rarely have to wait very long for service, which I appreciate. They certainly seem a bit slower in the evenings."}
{"text":"It's very easy to do sushi wrong but this place does it right. My wife and I love their seared tuna. Full bar and delicious food. It can get a little loud in the evenings on the weekends so sometimes its not the best place for conversation. Prices are reasonable and they have an awesome happy hour schedule."}
{"text":"Ordered a spicy salmon roll.  It smelled very, fishy and the color was brownish.  I took a picture to show how weird looking the cuts of fish were, I don't even know what part of the fish that's from. I hope I don't get sick from this."}
{"text":"Their happy hour is good. Sushi isn't the best but I figured it wouldn't be.  Sit outside so you can enjoy the sites on the strip and the interesting people that walk by you. Order a Tsunami Punch... they are YUMMY! Its like jungle juice made with Saki. Oh, and share it with another person. Actually, I take that back, order one for yourself and take the rest to go!!!  Oh how I love Vegas..."}
{"text":"Decent lunch special on the Strip if you're in the area and I'm finna go back off of convenience alone. =)  The location is outside the Fashion Mall, facing the Wynn Hotel.Daily   Daily Lunch special hours: 11 am to 3 pm  Service: 4/5  From my frequent visits with the work crew, our favorite is Kalani.  Very sweet and attentive every time she was assigned to us.  We never had any issues with the other servers as well.  Host or Hostess at the door always gets us seated quickly with a smile.  Food: 3/5 I usually hit up one of the Bento Box lunch specials and for me the best one is the Sashimi Bento (2 piece of tuna, yellowtail and salmon) with Teriyaki.  Sashimi is decent for a franchised Asian restaurant but the Teriyaki Chicken has been disappointing on numerous occasions.  Very bland and dry.  Shishito Peppers have always been tasty on my visits.  Value 4/5: Lunch special bento boxes, bowls and Shogun Bento Boxes is good value for the price and quality.  I can't comment on evening dishes at this time. (see pics)  Ambiance: 3.5/4 Love the red lantern, neo-tokyo decor art throughout the restaurant.  Music is playing rather loud, right before the point of being too loud.  If someone is hard of hearing, conversation might be an issue.  Summary: Location, location, location, lunch menu value and the friendly staff is what makes this place one of my strip location \"Go 2s\". The Happy Hour Menu looks promising and seems to review well so I'm looking forward to checking that out sooner vs. later.  Keep your expectations reasonable for a high volume franchised Sushi restaurant at lunch time, and you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"The Best Happy Hour on the face of planet! Seriously, they don't skimp at all when it comes to happy hour!! So many good appetizers and sushi rolls at half price! Large Kirin @$5/bottle!   My mom and I were in Vegas and we were craving sushi. I had heard about their HH before, so I suggested we go there. We got a TON of food and booze, and it was around $80. What a deal on the Strip!!!   I'm sick of hearing people complaining about sushi not being authentic enough at those American sushi places. I mean, what the hell do you expect??? Take a look at the menu before you go, and if all you see is Viva Las Vegas roll, Gojira roll, and Crazy monkey roll, do you really think they'd be serving you authentic Japanese sushi?? Come on... seriously. I don't think it's fair to rate a place unfavorably because of unreasonable expectations!  My favorites were Tootsy maki and Crispy spicy tuna. I also liked RAckin' shrimp. Crab cakes were a little too greasy. Spicy miso soup was actually pretty spicy, so if you don't like spicy food, don't get it.   Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. I think the food came out pretty fast, even though it was pretty crowded. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Patrick was amazing that spicy shrimp soup is to die for I highly recommend it my first time eating here but I will definitely be back as I just moved here and got a condo"}
{"text":"Came here on Friday night, I called the restaurant on our way and she/ the staff said waiting time was 10-15 minutes but when we got there at 6:30pm the place was half empty.  She/the staff tried to put us way in the back, cmon I'm an Asian eating at the Japanese restaurant and she tried to hide me??? She shouldn't do this to anyone, period!   Finally we sat at the sushi bar and waited for awhile for the waitress to take our drink order, at the meanwhile we ordered our food with the sushi chef instead, ( he is from Mexico and we had a nice chat).  I would give 3 stars for the food, I wish the staffs were nicer and more professional."}
{"text":"Came here for early dinner around 5:30 one night before we went for a show at ASU Gammage, the restaurant was still empty only few customers at the bar.  We sat at the sushi bar and we mostly order from the bar and it took so long for my Poke bowl to arrive???? The food was good but oh my my the service was sooo slow.  I gave 3 stars for the food and complimentary mochi ice cream ( it was my bday) and thank you for that, but next time better service please!"}
{"text":"Sub par sushi.   Ra was the first place I had ever tried sushi and I really enjoyed it. However, after broadening my horizons and dining at other sushi establishments (Hiro, etc.), I discovered that there are much better options all over the valley.   If you go, I would recommend the Las Vegas roll (not sure what's in it) and calamari roll (fried calamari, cream cheese, white rice, and topped with eel sauce and tempura flakes). Both are decent and are much better tasting than their other rolls.  They have good happy hour deals. Rolls are definitely much smaller here than anywhere else I've been."}
{"text":"If you have to feel like you're looking cool when you eat your sushi, this must be your place. I say that because it's always crowded and I fail to see the allure.  If you want sushi, there are better places nearby. If you want to go out and party, there are better places nearby. If you want to go out and party while eating sushi, you come here!   The sushi menu is incredibly gimmicky. Be prepared to hunt for their \"dictionary\" so you can see what you're ordering. The happy hour deals are decent- I like both the Viva Las Vegas and Tootsy Maki rolls, but they just barely resemble sushi. Aside from the sushi, my fiance always orders the Chicken Katsu and enjoys it (particularly the wasabi mashed potatoes), but that's the only thing he orders at any Japanese restaurant.   There's always loud music blaring and after about 5, drunk girls in the bathroom. I can tolerate this place when someone else wants to go, but see no reason to eat here on my own accord."}
{"text":"Never disappointed by this RA location! The service is always great and there are always customers. The wait time can be long at times but it is worth it. Their happy hour is from 5-7 and they have discounted sushi and drinks. We ordered a lot of sushi and a drink and only spent about $50 which is a great price. We usually spend close to $100. My favorite roll is the crunchy calamari roll and the viva Vegas roll. The sake is also a favorite."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants for lunch at work, dinner/ happy hour in the strip. The employees and management go out of their way to make you meal memorable.... and so good!"}
{"text":"I used to come here lots but their prices seem to have been going up. I used to really get a good variety of sushi from the happy hour menu and not spend more than $30 for two people but now just seems a little over priced. Nice patio and quick fix of sushi if you need it."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at this particular Ra. I left the restaurant thinking about how horrible the service was, but giving it the usual \"but maybe it was just a bad night there\". But, from reading the other reviews, I'd have to say it's a bad night there every night.   We went on a Friday night at 6pm, so I expected it to be busy... but it actually wasn't too bad. There were about 5 empty tables indoors, and we sat at one of the 3 empty tables on the back patio. It took the server about 15 minutes to acknowledge our existence, and only after we went to the bartender to ask for drinks. I have to give the guy credit though, he was pleasant the whole time.   As we were getting to the end of our meal, the patio was getting more and more crowded, which means that there were more and more people standing (very close to our table, which makes me a little uncomfortable).   We had saki bombers, edemame, shrimp tempura, and california rolls. The edemame was good- my first attempt at this appetizer. California rolls, which are usually my favorite, were rolled very loosely which made each one fall apart when picked up with the chop sticks. Bummer."}
{"text":"I've heard of the Ra restaurants in Cali, but figured since we were in Vegas we should try it out. I mean the restaurants are supposed to considered even better out here right??  Um no. I was seriously disappointed, the sushi was nothing special. And to top it off, my group couldn't talk. There were six of us, and we could not hear each other because the music was SO LOUD! I mean eating in silence is one thing, but silence surrounded by earblowing music is a whole other awkward ordeal."}
{"text":"The sushi is not good, the only thing good is the happy hour prices.  Service is OK, not stellar.  You have to hope that your waiter/waitress doesn't have friends at the bar or is friends with the hostess or you'll never see him/her."}
{"text":"Utterly unremarkable sushi chain restaurant that sells itself as more than it really is with young servers who nod their heads enthusiastically and agree with whatever view you might throw out, rubbish generic electronic music, trendy names for bland, unbalanced sushi creations and a natural gas fire feature on the outside deck.  Frequented by empty-headed chasers of the latest fashionable thing to wear which nearly always comes off as dreadfully forced and manufactured.  Avoid as much as humanly possible.  Not even remotely inspired or interesting cuisine."}
{"text":"I have been to several RA locations and, in my opinion, this one is the best.  Probably have ate / drank here 40 or 50 times in the last 7 years.  I hands down love this place.  Don't know how anybody could not give it 5 stars.    The sushi has always been great.  We have never had a bad piece of sushi here - in fact my sake bomber and I consider it to be kind of the standard by which we measure other places that serve sushi.    Yes, the Kirin sake bombers are always on special, but I like Asahi better than Kirin and they have both, so I'm in good shape.    Additionally, the female employees are generally pretty attractive at this place, which makes it easier to sit and hang out for extended periods of time.  And there are usually a couple of dude bartenders that my wife can stare at a little, so she's placated.    The crowd is usally pretty good Thursday, Friday & Saturday nights, the club music type atmosphere is current, relevant and helps keep you in high spirits.  Finally, since the theater is right next door, you can people watch from the patio pretty easily.    Pricing is what you would expect for a place of this caliber and atmosphere.    Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Im really surprised at some of these negative reviews! Ive never had anything but terrific service/ food here. Whether its at the inside bar, restaurant, sushi bar, or outside bar and tables.  One of my fave things to do is sit at the back bar w/ friends and have just a drink on the way to another bar, or a full dinner. Its place I always check for seats 1st."}
{"text":"Continuing my food tour of Phoenix/Scottsdale, we went to RA for sushi.  Keep in mind that I come from L.A. where there is some damn fresh sushi to be had nearly everywhere so I was pretty reluctant to go in but our hotel was nearby and we ended up going to the Kierland shopping center all the time.    When I first walked in,  I thought the restaurant smelled fishy in a BAD way. I decided to order cooked stuff. I didn't trust the look of the tuna which looked mushy and old. But I do have to say the green iced tea was really good- it had that smoky flavor usually lost with green tea from a powder mix. Actually, all the iced tea I had the entire week was really good.   I was happy the food tasted better than the smell in the air. My unagi bowl was good- the sauce wasn't too heavy and I liked the ring of shredded cucumber surrounding the unagi (although sliced a little bit too thin). My Arizona roll (okay, so I go for fun party rolls occasionally) was bland and devoid of any spicyness or flavor. It was supposed to be a spicy salmon flavored with jalepeno. Even the avocado was tasteless.   I liked the calamari roll, spicy yellowtail and spicy tuna rolls better my friends had ordered. The best part was probably discovering our drinks weren't charged. I suppose it was part of their lunch special.   I do have to note the bar smelled strange as well as the ladies' room. The restroom had that liver of sulfur smell and the bar just plain smelled bad. If you don't have a sense of smell, this might be a good sushi place for you."}
{"text":"Pro: *Tasty Food *I ordered off of the \"Nicky's Week\" menu so my money went to a good cause.   Con: *I lost out on time at work because my 60 min lunch took 80 mins here even though it was empty. *My tiny bowl of Miso Soup cost $4.10"}
{"text":"RA Sushi is a great Japanese restaurant with a lot of unique dishes that are often not found in most Japanese restaurant. I had not noticed this the first time I went there until after we ordered the food.   This trip, we took the time to look over the menu. I highly recommend their Shishito Peppers and Tunacado for appetizers. Both dishes are very simple and served with sauces that are full of flavor. The Shishito Peppers can be very spicy so make sure your glass is full of water!  For those who loves sashimi but would also like to get a dish that is more filling, I highly recommend their Bara Chirashi bowl. It is a balanced dish with a combination of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, shrimp and vegetables, served with rice. The sauce is a little on the sweet side but definitely tasty.   I highly recommend this place to sushi and sashimi lovers who looks for something different."}
{"text":"We come here at least once a month. Today's service was the worst we have ever had. Madison was our server. I had to asked 2 other servers to get what we needed. Our food was dropped and she never came to do a check back. We were out of water and my husband just got up and got his own. I asked for the manager and Alberto came to speak with us. There was an apology offered and I thank you Alberto we will only be back because of the way you handled this situation. Thank you Alberto!"}
{"text":"Good for a small stop and satisfy sushi craving. Try the monkey collections as they have a good blend of flavors. The good thing is their happy hour, I been there twice now, only at this time."}
{"text":"Excellent. Get there between 4-7pm for a great happy hour. High quality sushi for CHEAP! We try to make it once a week because its so reasonable. But remember, when stuff is half off, YOU TIP A PERCENTAGE OF WHAT THE TOTAL WOULD HAVE BEEN, not the total after 50% off. No I don't work there, just a friendly reminder."}
{"text":"I must have a been here at least a hundred times that I remember and hundred more that I have completely lost due to alcohol induced amnesia. But every time I went the service was great and the food was good. Yes it's your basic Japanese cuisine but one thing that always brings me back is the Crazy Monkey. Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to other locations, while the Tempe location was pretty good it did not feel as clean as the Atlanta location.  Our server was pleasant and helpful.  I went with two co-workers and we feasted! We ordered a ton of food a good mix of sashimi and rolls.  The sashimi was fresh and tasty! The sushi rolls were ok, good not great! The drinks were a tad on the weak side especially for the cost!  Overall I would go back but would hope for better rolls next time."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of time now and must say the place rocks.  Prices are reasonable and the staff is somewhat attentive.  If you like to try different types of sushi rolls this place is for you.  Sashimi is good too  Located by the Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"Ra is definitely worth hitting up for Happy Hour.  I will admit that when my girlfriends and I ate there, we slid in about 6:45 (15 minutes to closing) and just a tad inebriated!  Our waiter was pretty awesome and let us get our order in immediately so we could take advantage of the fleeting happy hour prices.    We ordered two Las Vegas rolls, tuna sashimi, a Ra-ckin Shrimp, and a round of Sake bombs.  By the end of the meal we were giddy, full, and more than willing to pay full price for dessert.  We ordered the coconut creme brulee and it was delicious, although it could have used a bit more coconut flavor.  It looked and tasted very much like a traditional creme brulee.  Our bill ended up being $100, but we all drank and ate pretty well.  We weren't overly stuffed, but just right.    Located by the fashion mall, Ra Sushi is a must if you are looking for delicious sushi on a budget and are staying anywhere within walking distance; for us it was from the Venetian.  Happy  Hour goes til 7, and make sure you order the Las Vegas roll and Ra-ckin shrimp!! They won't disappoint!!!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 4:00 on a Saturday and chose to sit in the bar so my bf could watch one of the baseball games on TV. The bartender explained that it was happy hour and offered the happy hour menu in addition to the regular menu. The happy hour prices didn't seem veery happy. $5 well drinks and $6-$8 specialty drinks. Food choices were also on \"special\" but comparing them to the regular price on the menu we found most were only discounted less than a dollar. In once instance, it was a 23 cent discount. The seaweed salad was pretty tasty but the rest was just average. The bartender waiting on us was more focused on two regulars or friends that sat on the other side of the bar than the other four patrons that she was supposed to be taking care of. When she would come around she was nice enough but definitely not attentive. Empty drinks, empty plates, long waits for food etc. there was a bottle of Japanese whisky that caught my eye that I asked about. She said that she heard good things about it. When I asked the price she said $8.50. I had her get me some on the rocks. I didn't really care for it, it tasted more like a scotch than a regular whisky but that wasn't her fault but I was a little taken back when she brought the check out and informed us that the drink was actually $11.50 (oops). With so many other sushi places in the valley, I don't think we'll be coming back to Ra. Oh well, live and learn."}
{"text":"I just want to say thank you to our server, Miranda! Our son has special needs and she treated him so kindly! She made sure to let us know how the dishes we ordered him were prepared and asked him if he was having a good dinner. He is completely non verbal and she didn't let that stop her from treating him like any other guest! Thank you RA and Miranda for making the start of my sons 11th birthday very special!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but I can't understand why everyone is so hard on this place. It is a bit pricey, but the sushi here is actually of really good quality (you think it's bad, try some of the stuff here in London ...THAT'S bad!)  This place holds a special place in my heart as the first restaurant I visited in Arizona, and was really quite impressed with the decor and the lunchtime menu. I had the unagi bowl (teriyaki eel over rice) and OMG, loved it.   Obviously, I'd watch it if it wasn't lunchtime/happy hour as the bill adds up QUICK but it's a good place when you're craving sushi!"}
{"text":"I like this place enough.. and would go if I had a hunger for something Japanese-like or even some Sushi that passed as fresh. .. If I were at that shopping area already or nearby... not sure if I would necessarily go out of my way to go there.   Things is, I am not a really big on the service @ RA.. Never anything spectacular, and I guess I am not really looking for spectacular.. just good. Lunch is my favorite time to go to RA as there are good lunch specials like the \"spicy tuna bowl\" for about $5 .. and the price allows me to forget that the service isn't so great. Thanks!"}
{"text":"We were hungry.. walking the strip because we were tired of eating at the same old places.  We walked over to the Fashion Show and scoped out the restaurants there.  We went downstairs toward the thumping loud music coming from the sushi restaurant.  At first we were hesitant to eat here, because the music was seriously loud.  I mean, club level loud.  But we decided to eat here because they had an interesting sounding sushi roll on their menu.. the \"Crazy Monkey\" .  We had to have a crazy monkey.. because monkey is just our thing!  (no, not monkey meat silly people!)  You have to try this roll!  It was seriously YUMMY!  It was pretty much a philly roll, with avocado on top too.  But the unique this was their mango sauce they drizzle on it.  It was sooooo goooood!  We had already had our fill of drinks for the night, but we also saw someone order a Tsunami Punch... 60 oz of mixture of sake and other hard liquors that I can't remember.  The thing was huge!  for $10!  The table next to us ordered 1 and they had 3 people working on this thing.  Next time, I'm going to have one of these!  ***** Update Sept 2007****  We went back, and I tried the Tsunami Punch.  Sooooo goood!  We shared it between 3 people.  I'd say its more of a 2 person drink."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The happy hour specials are great! We got there around 930pm but happy hour didnt start till 10 so we ordered water and some Edamame and told our waitress we wanted to wait till 10 to order the rest of our food. She was very nice and polite. We ordered the Vegas Rolls of course and the peppers which were amazing!! The peppers had a little spice to them but not overwhelming. The Vegas Roll was perfect!  For drinks we ordered the blushing geisha and a baby umami.  The blushing geisha was a good concept but it was way to sour and gave my instant heartburn.  Once our food arrived we wanted to move outside because it did get a little chilly inside. Surprisingly. Haha. Once we moved outside it was great. I wish they would add some misters. Theu have heaters for winter..but no misters haha definitely a must have. Would make it so much more enjoyable to be outside. They have two different patios one in the front and one on the back side. We ordered the coconut creme brulee for dessert it was amazing. Overall i would come back here but probably only for happy hour because it can get pricey if not on happy hour.  Thanks RA  Their wasabi is great!!  ** another not enjoyable part was once we were outside there was a group of about 5 people drinking heavily and cussing up a storm, it was not very enjoyable to hear the whole time outside**"}
{"text":"Went to late night happy hour last night - 5 stars for the calamari - best thing on their menu - perfect tempura - will be back for more! Rainbow roll was small, expensive and did not look the photo."}
{"text":"The food, the company surrounding me, and a birthday to celebrate; I was happy to be here. Had a party of 12 and immediately felt this pre-planned reservation was \"inconvenient\" for the hostess & server."}
{"text":"Marcella is an absolutely amazing server! So attentive and pleasant. Came with a decent group tonight. Had some sushi-virgins, and she was more than courteous and helpful in navigating some rather \"tricky\" waters. All with a smile on her face. Rolls were fast, fresh and exceptionally presented. Never a dissatisfying moment."}
{"text":"I have been to this location two times now. The sushi has been good and the service so so. The happy hour prices are good and the Ra'kin shrimp is amazing. Our waitress disappeared for about fifteen minutes at one point but overall my experience here has been pretty good. The spicy lobster roll is great as well as the las Vegas roll. For Arizona \"desert\" sushi this place is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"I visited this location of RA recently on a Friday night and had an okay experience. I say just okay because that's all it really was. It was about 6pm when my friend and I arrived. It was moderately busy but we were seated right away. We were promptly greeted by our waiter which was nice and I figured that it was a good start. We filled out our sushi order sheet and our waiter took it back within five minutes of being seated.   We got an order on the Ra'kin Shrimp which arrived within a few minutes of order which was great. We had also ordered a Las Vegas roll and a spicy lobster roll and and order of edamame. After we had received the Ra'kin Shrimp everything else seemed very behind. After twenty minutes had passed and our waiter was no where to be found we were a little annoyed. A few minutes later our Las Vegas roll finally arrived but the spicy lobster roll and edamame had not come out with the Las Vegas roll. Still our waiter was no where to be found. After we had eaten the rest of our shrimp and LV roll we decided to just flag someone down and cancel the order for our other items since no one had bothered to visit our table again and tell us that we would be in for a wait (which would have been fine if we would have been informed of this.)  The manager came over and then comped the rest of our meal which I appreciated as far as customer service goes. We waited in total 40 minutes and only received half of what we ordered. I understand that it was a Friday night on Mill Ave but we should have at least been informed of this delay in our food prep. The manager did take care of it and I think that was great move on his part. I might give this location another shot and I enjoy the food at RA. The service could use a little improvement at this location but hopefully they are headed in the right direction."}
{"text":"Stopped in one evening while staying in Scottsdale for business with a few colleagues and left with a smile. Being from somewhere where we take great pride in fresh seafood, I was a little leery about ordering fresh seafood in Arizona. I was quite surprised and my opinion drastically changed.    We all were seated promptly and had amazing service from our server. Drinks came quick and orders taken just as quick. I ended up getting, if i remember right, the Gojira Roll which was fantastic. After finishing my roll and a bottle of sake, which was recommended by our server, I was extremely pleased with my experience.   Next time I'm in the area and I have a hankering for some sushi I will most likely stop in again!"}
{"text":"Let me start off with saying I love this restaurant.  I have never had bad sushi here... Until last night. The sushi was just off.  We ordered 3 different rolls.  Viva Las Vegas,  Philadelphia,  and Shrimp Tempura.  The portions were unusually small.  The Shrimp Tempura was poorly wrapped...as in practically falling apart.  It was so loose the chopsticks couldn't pick it up.  Taste wise it was pretty good... But difficult to eat and we only got 4 pieces.  The Viva Las Vegas was delicious as always.  The Philadelphia was not good.  It was the biggest of the rolls but it tasted like bad salmon."}
{"text":"4 stars only for their Scallop Dynamite roll. That thing was absolutely delish.  Also had the Crazy Monkey and Crunchy Calamari rolls with a chicken teriyaki bento box. All 3 were blah. The Crazy Monkey was too sweet due to the mango sauce and the Crunchy Calamari shouldn't have had cream cheese in it. My chicken teriyaki was bland. I made my fiance finish it cuz I didn't want it.  Being pregnant, this was the only place that had a variety of cooked sushi on the strip cuz obviously, I can't eat raw food. But why did every roll have to have cream cheese?   Service was pretty good as our glasses were always refilled and we got our sushi and bento boxes rather quickly. We were in and out in about an hour or less.  4 stars only for their Scallop Dynamite roll. Okay, and for the good service we received and cleanliness of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"We came here for my brother in laws birthday dinner before a night out on the town. It was surprisingly empty but it was around 7-8pm so maybe we missed the dinner rush.  It's a very cute restaurant, super dark inside though. It makes for a nice ambiance but hard to see what your food really looks like.  Our waiter was great and very attentive.  The menu is simple. A good amount of options but not much variety. I ordered a crunchy shrimp tempura roll and seaweed salad and my husband ordered the black pepper steak.  The crunchy shrimp tempura roll was okay. My husbands black pepper steak was good, very tender and cooked perfect. The veggies (mushrooms and asparagus) were very salty though, even for him and he usually likes his food pretty salted.  Overall it seems like a great place for small bites and drinks with friends, the food came out very quickly which is great, especially if you're short on time."}
{"text":"The service here is atrocious; specifically at the bar,  where service is better in literally every other restaurant ever... on more than one visit, not only did they forget to place our order, but they also placed it incorrectly and brought the wrong item. AND THEN there isn't even an apology. Dude, you're not busy... there is no excuse. Only perk is the late night hours but that's hardly a perk when it's breakfast by the time you bring the water I asked for 2 hours ago. It's cool, Ra. I tip appropriately."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Loved the sushi. Service and sushi were excellent. Had a great time and they sell awesome drinks. I will be back. Located close to the Fashion Mall and across street from THE WYNN."}
{"text":"Came for the Happy Hour menu (5-7pm) and although the place was packed, we were seated immediately at the sushi bar. Calamari app was perfect - light, crispy, and dry - not dripping with oil like at the Scottsdale location! Three rolls, two sushi and a couple of beer/sakes later and we were stuffed and only $36 in! All the food was super-fresh. Yellowtail was a little too cold, actually, had to let it sit for a few minutes. Had to wait a little longer than I'd like to pay the check, but that's because our server clearly had too many tables to handle - when the place is packed like that, they should schedule more servers to come in."}
{"text":"I see a lot of mixed and not-so-hot reviews on this board but I gotta say I haven't had a questionable experience here yet, and I've been here at least five times. I personally have always had quick seating, fresh fish, fast service, and attentive servers. It's never smelled funny whenever I have eaten here and I would recommend this place for both bar and table seating (you know how you get screwed when you order sushi at the table at almost any other Japanese restaurant). Has never happened to me! Just luckie, I guess."}
{"text":"Good Sushi, great happy hour prices.   Well, most of the time good sushi. Try to get to know one of the chefs, your sushi gets a lot better! The other fare is not as good as the sushi.  One of my favorite parts of sushi is Saki and they do have a good Saki menu. Bombers aside, and they have bombers, they have good Saki. Although not always enough knowledge of Saki, or sushi for that matter. It is obvious that the management is well aware that they have a golden location and are not really that worried about the staff being impressive in their knowledge of what they are serving.   Pretty sweet music most times!"}
{"text":"This review is a couple of weeks old, but I wanted to thank Ra Sushi for a great dining experience. Although we came here on a Saturday night, the service was exceptional. Our server was very attentive and did not keep us waiting for anything we ordered. A couple of our friends had severe food allergies, and the manager personally came to address how they will try to accommodate us to the best of their ability. Additionally, the manager was walking by when he saw I needed hot water for my baby, and he helped me out right away. The rolls are average size, but they were all great as well. Ra was very accommodating and I hope to be back when we are in town. Thank you!"}
{"text":"RA is a flashy sushi place that thrives on the novelty of sushi rather than the art of it. But, whatever, because they have some good food and a ridiculously amazing happy hour. I try not to go there after 6 or 7pm, since I value my hearing. It sounds like you are inside a stereo woofer! If you do go later it would be a great place to go if you don't like to talk much. The staff is generally pleasant."}
{"text":"Went here for an early business dinner.  It was good, not amazing, but definitely one of the Top 3 sushi restaurants in Scottsdale/Phoenix.  Enjoyed the Miso Soup, Seaweed Salad, Salmon Sashimi and Vegas Roll, but wasn't blown away with anything unfortunately.  This place is just enough for a fourth star in my book, but barely."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  Especially the sushi.  The waitress was the greatest.  I would come back here anytime when I am in Phoenix . Good happy hour.  Food and drinks"}
{"text":"Ok. Let me be clear. This is typically our choice for sushi. Not because it's the greatest sushi in the world but because we like the service and atmosphere and can't go wrong  with happy hour menu. Tonight, we called ahead for party of 6. I spoke to Rachel who told me they did not usually take phone reservations but that she would oblige me because there was only one party on list in front of us. We arrived five minutes afterward-I was told we would be texted when table was ready and that they  would text when table available. We watched EVERY SINGLE PARTY be seated ahead of us and FINALLY received text one hour and 49 minutes after talking to Rachel. Sadly for RA, we already were at Ginban enjoying drinks and appetizers because we grew tired of watching walk in parties be seated before us.  Also sad for RA:  my boyfriend and I used to regularly choose this for late night, dinner, and happy hour. Now, I will NEVER spend my $$ there.  Not when I can choose from places with food and drink that compete and that pretend to value my patronage like Stingray, mido, or Ginban. Btw. If you drive two miles southwest into awhatukee, you will find a sushi restaurant that is just as good or better and where the staff value your patronage. Thanks Ginban. FU RA. You guys won't get a cent of my business EVER AGAIN. If I could give .0135 stars- I totally would. You guys suck. Your sushi is average and your hostesses don't know how to anticipate a mid size party. You pissed me off beyond repair tonight."}
{"text":"Good sushi and hot appetizers. Excellent happy hour! Pretty good service. Atmosphere is loud!"}
{"text":"Service sucked!!!    All I wanted was a refill for my iced tea .....i had to ask for it after I tried  to make eye contact with servers.  Sushi is over priced and average in taste.  Soba noodles tasted like Cup O Noodles.....they make the place look sophisticated by turning down the lights.  What a dump!!"}
{"text":"This was our third time here. We come in from across the country looking forward to eating here. The food was great tonight, as usual, which is why I gave it two stars but the service was absolutely terrible!!!! We ordered appetizers that the waitress never bothered to tell us they were out of until we asked where they were!! They forgot half our food, coming to the table asking if we had everything and then when told no her response was \"oh it's in the window waiting\". We had to ask the staff running food for refills. The waitress asked if we wanted dessert but only asked half the table so the other half tried to flag her down 3 times before finally one of the runners took our order!! We were asked what the waitress' name was but no one knew since we hardly saw her!!! Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"For a slow Tuesday night, I didn't expect to get as bad of service as what was received. My friend and I went for a quick bite and even just the greet from Berlin wasn't very friendly. Our service was some of the worst I've received for such an easy table. By the time me and my friend finished our drinks and 75% of our spring rolls, my friends miso finally came out. When Berlin came to refill our drinks, we said thank you and she responded with a \"uh huh\". I was very surprised with the service we received because Ra's service steps in training are gone over extensively. I only know this because I've previously worked with the company. There was no 2 bite check backs, no filling drinks before 1/2 empty, along with miso is supposed to be brought out before food. I was under the impression she forgot to make it, due to it not coming out till we were almost done with our appetizer. When paying for our tab, she came and asked if we were ready when we were obviously still looking at the tab and upon putting the check book up, we definitely waited for more than 3-5 minutes and finally decided to just pay with cash. Me and my friend are both still in the industry and I hate to complain, but c'mon, look over the server steps. It shouldn't be that hard to serve a 2 top with an iced tea, water, miso, egg rolls, uchi no salad, and a side of udon noodles. I will of course go back because I love the food, but I hope next time visiting this location, will be better.   On the bright side, last time we came to this location, on Sunday, August 20th during the night shift, we had a male server at our 3 top, and he was phenomenal! I really wish I remembered his name. He was friendly, outgoing, and more than pleased to serve us. Would love to have him again!"}
{"text":"Boy oh boy was the service slow....miserably slow, especially considering the place was empty on a Saturday for lunch and our waitress seemed to have only 3 tables to attend to.  Granted my friend and I were hungover and time was moving quite slowly, but wowww things were slow.   We started off with waters to help with the hangovers and put in a few orders for apps to hold us over until some other friends joined us - turned out they were too hungover to move and never managed to make it, but thats another story.   The apps took a long time to come out, but eventually we were munching away and somewhat happy.   Then we placed our entree orders.  We both went with a lunch special which was nicely priced and probably the only good thing I have to say about RA.   Then my friend fell asleep... that's literally how long it took them to get our miso soups out (aren't these already made and just need to be heated up??) and then fell asleep again before our entrees came out - and these were not complex entrees!    Geez, imagine if I had to come here for lunch on my lunch break from work - I'd probably be fired by the time I got back to work!   Anyways - food was ok, and at this point our waters had long run dry.... I pretty much had to beg for a refill.     All in all, the price was cheap and that left my wallet happy, although personally I left annoyed and swearing off any other RA location!"}
{"text":"The Happy Hour at RA is ridiculous.  Great sushi.   Great beer.  Great prices.  TIP - Get the lobster shrimp roll...  trust."}
{"text":"The ambiance here definitely is a good touch to the restaurant. Love the different sitting options. They have an amazing happy hour choice as well on Wednesdays. I have been here about 3 times or so now and will remain a regular."}
{"text":"First night of the trip and we decide to try some sushi. Best decision! Sam was the.best.waiter.EVER! We told him to pick our sushi rolls for us and he totally knocked it out of the park with his choices. Described everything well and was SO personable!! SamSamSam Bomb Bomb BOMB!!! Thanks for all the great suggestions and wonderful service!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Las Vegas (which is about 5-6 times a year) I HAVE to eat here. If I could give them more than 5 stars I would. I've had sushi from San Francisco all the way to Brooklyn and all the places in between, not a single place can hold a candle to Ra Sushi. The sushi is fresh and made in a speedy fashion. I love the the Ami Ebi. The unagi is fresh and has a great taste to it. The crunchy shrimp tempura roll is delicious. The main reason I go every time is the mango lobster rolls, you wont find these any where else but here. Also, if you are not a big fan of seaweed I believe they give you the option of using rice/soy paper instead. It worked out perfectly for my sister.in.law, a first time sushi eater."}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience. I have never had a restaurant try to take advantage of a customer the way this RA location did today. I do not recommend going to this location. Complete ripoff and service was terrible. Nothing but a bunch of lazy employees that would rather over change and take full advantage of their customers. TERRIBLE."}
{"text":"I give this place two stars for my meal and one star for the service. I wasn't too impressed with my visit here. It started with a visit to the restroom to wash my hands. There was a homeless guy inside washing up. What amazed me was that the place was dead and they had two big guys performing security duties. Really? How did this guy get past these two goons.  We requested to be seated outside and they accomodated our group. Our server was cool. She was very attentive. My girl ordered some spicy sushi plate. I can't even remember the name of it. That's how boring it was. I personally ordered the Dynamite something something. That was delicious and it was considered an appetizer. Three of us shared it. Truly the highlight of our meal here.  I had a bottle of Sapporo and Kirin Light. For some good sushi go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Happy hour deal is good otherwise not worth the prices they charge. Drinks are awful, can't taste the alcohol at all."}
{"text":"Come ONLY during Happy Hour: 3-7 PM if you want the best deal on sushi and appetizers.  My personal favourites: Viva Las Vegas Roll, Crispy Soft Shell Crab, Lobster Spring Rolls, and of course the Miso Soup.  Appetizers are 1/2 off during happy hour and decreased prices on sushi. You can't get a better deal than this on the Las Vegas strip! The restaurant itself has a great modern ambiance. During my early college years, this was the spot on Sunday nights with a DJ by the bar.  Fun place to eat and hang with your friends! I rated it a 4. It would've been a 5 if regular prices would be a little cheaper.  Love the RA!"}
{"text":"Came to this RA (I frequent the mill location) and ordered a few rolls to go for lunch. When I bit into my avocado roll it was rock hard. The avocados were so ripe that it was inedible. And same with the cucumbers in the tootsie maki roll. I'm hungry and disappointed.   The staff seemed nice though."}
{"text":"Yay for Happy Hour on Saturdays! Half off apps and rolls and good drink specials. Try the Las Vegas roll and the spicy tuna."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I love RA and this is my first visit to this particular location. A friend and I met about 1:15 for lunch and the place was pretty empty. Service was slow and the waitress was very nice but it took a while for our food to come out. We started off with a garlic edamame appetizer, so delicious! The sauce was so good I saved it for the sushi. They had some new items on their menu and we ordered the chili shrimp roll and the shrimp calamari roll, both were great. Also got the ultimate shrimp tempura roll from their regular menu. I had room for dessert and my friend hadn't tried their banana split maki, so we got that and it was good but not as good as I remember. Great food overall but the service was a bit lacking as it took the waitress 10 minutes just to pick up our checks to process the payment."}
{"text":"Happy hour has an awesome selection of sushi and drinks. I love coming here for date night, the servers are always attentive and quick. I highly recommend trying the strawberry mojito and the crunchy spicy tuna roll!"}
{"text":"I had a great time and enjoyed the food. My favorite was the  Shishito peppers!!! The vegetable roll was so-so I'd go with a avocado roll rather next time. Great Sunday deals 12-5!   Service was great at the sushi bar. I saw they have a bit of out door seating too for summer!"}
{"text":"Have been back a few more times now since the happy hour deals are so great and I always go on a weeknight now. Service is much better than on the weekends, deals are great and food is good. Join their email club too, they are always sending out discounts."}
{"text":"I used to go to RA Scottsdale all the time when I lived in PHX and I loved it, and everytime that I have gone back since, I have enjoyed it just as much. I ended up at the Chandler RA less than enthused during my last trip to Phoenix because I had been there before, and it's just not the same..   Yeah, its the same sushi and the same prices - but it just feels more like a chain than the Scottsdale one does.. or at least, did.. I haven't been there in a couple years.   Happy Hour is pretty solid and we had a bunch of sushi and saki for a good price, so it's worth it during those times. After that, I'm not sure.. I wouldn't go out of my way.. like I used to do for RA in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Looking for sushi? Ehhh, this place has lots of choices but i think their other food items are better than their sushi. There are other places with much better sushi. Keep in mind this is a bar. Also, pretty spendy, even at happy hour alot of items are half price, but it's still expensive. Had two drinks, one roll and edamame and my bill was $35!"}
{"text":"Where to start with this place...well it waaaaaay overpriced. People at just about all the locations I have been to are really poor servers and can never answer any questions about the sushi served at RA. The chicken dishes are good, drinks are alright but nothing to get excited about.  That's about all I can say to sum it up!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch about a month ago on a Saturday.  Everything was really good.  The lunch specials were great...even on the weekend.  My daughter and I both ordered the spicy tuna roll and the Mr ordered the California roll.  Everything was fairly priced and included soup and salad.  We definitely left satisfied. The service was also very quick and friendly.    We stopped in again this past weekend and just had drinks at the bar.  Again, service was great."}
{"text":"Got sent here from Social House at TI... this place is allegedly open for food until midnight and until 2am for drinks on Monday nights, but we got here at 1am and it was muy cerrado. The staff closing up did send us on to legs four and five of our quest for late night Vegas sushi: Hamada and Kaizen.    Would like to come back to RA... it does have a reasonably cool location looking out onto the orgy of marketing that is the Fashion Show Mall pedestrian plaza."}
{"text":"The ginger dressing salad was the best thing there. All the other stuff is just ok and seemed kinda cheap. After trying the appetizers, I chose to skip the sushi. The staff really tries but I think that there is not much to get excited about at this place. It's dark in there and probably brings them down. Not going back. Much better places in vegas."}
{"text":"I shouldn't even really be writing about this place, as I've only been here once, for lunch, and I didn't order sushi...I had one of the lunch special bowls. But THAT's why I'm bothering to write this! For around $8-10 you get a giant bowl of rice topped with veggies, avocado, spicy tuna, salmon, or teriyaki chicken. Plus you get a bowl of miso soup. A bangin' deal, considering you're on the Strip, at an upscale mall, no less. The food quality was great and the atmo was sort of trendy but not annoyingly so. I might actually come here again sometime!"}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of their happy hour. Can't go wrong with their drink specials! I'm a huge fan of their pork gyoza and edamame. Great for lunch too! Ironic, since I hate all sea food, this is one of my favorite places."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Fast service, good music.  Just wish the prices were a little better/cheaper."}
{"text":"One of my favorite happy hour spots.  The happy hour food menu is strong and there are drink options for everyone.  The best deal would be the $7 Sake and large Kirin.   The sushi itself, while definitely not the best in town, is decent.  I've never had anything bad or regretful here.  The atmosphere is always enjoyable and if the weather permits the patio is a great group spot (or just for general people watching).    You have a lot of choices in this area so I wouldn't go here every week but I definitely would keep it in my rotation."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Very consistent chain! I was by myself so I sat at the bar next to a potty mouth and his friends. I had the Viva Las Vegas rolls, of course. Gabrielle the bartender was super nice.  This is a smaller location. They always have their music too loud. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Omg this place has gone downhill!!!!   This WAS one of my favorite happy hour spots in town. Not so much anymore.   My friend and I were in the area and decided on this spot to meet up for drinks. We walked in, waited about 5 mins for a table and sat down. TWENTY minutes pass and still no service. My friend finally got up to the hostess to ask where out server was. The only saving grace of this place was our server. I completely forgot her name but she was so bubbly and nice. Not the fake nice, but the genuine nice.   Anyway, prices for HH went up about 75 cents. Food quality went downhill with smaller portions. I ordered this one frozen lemonade Bellini concoction and it was awful. Only reason I drank it was because I didn't want to waste alcohol.   Anyway, I had a good time with my friend but I don't think I'll be returning here nor would I recommend anyone to this place ever!!"}
{"text":"Always consistent with food and service! The hot mess is by far the best item on the menu!"}
{"text":"RA Sushi is not a bad stop if you're near the mall and looking for cheap eats.   RA is located on the first floor of the Fashion Mall and with a good view of Encore/Wynn and the street.  It has a patio area to people watch which is pretty fun.  Coming in at lunch on a Sunday was pretty quiet and they do have some nice lunch specials like $10 bento boxes and a few other meal plans.  The bento box itself wasn't too bad in terms of value.  You get miso soup, rice, the bento box entree you chose (I got chicken teriyaki) and a small salad.  I also got the sake samplers which was $9 for three different sake tastings which were pretty good.  The miso soup wasn't too shabby.  The rice was just rice - nothing special.  The chicken teriyaki was a bit salty but was cooked all right.  And the salad was not bad.  Service was solid and helpful.     They also have a happy hour (about 4-7PM if I remember correctly) with some good sushi/drink deals.     Don't expect too much from RA in terms of the best food in the area.  However, if you're coming at the right moments (whether it's happy hour or lunch), the people watching is fun and the deal isn't too shabby either."}
{"text":"I give RA 4 stars mainly because I had a great time there.  I was with a fairly big group, most of whom hadn't seen each other in a few.  You could tell that most of the girls in the place were only there because they think eating sushi is \"trendy\".  You're stupid.    Anyway, the sushi was better than that of the RA in Chicago, so I was pleased.  My martini would have probably been a little too strong for most, but those that know me know that \"too strong\" is not in my vocabulary when it comes to alcohol, so I didn't mind.  Overall, it was a pleasant experience and if I lived in the area, I would go back again, however, on my next trip out there, I would like to try another sushi establishment."}
{"text":"Yeah, you're trendy, but I like ya.  Yeah, you're a chain, but I still like ya. Yeah, you're named after the bad guy in Stargate, I still like ya.   Although, this place can be hit or miss.  Pretty decent rolls and good lunch specials.  Sometimes service is good sometimes not so much.  I like their more creative rolls, like the Viva Las Vegas roll and the Tootsie Maki Roll.  Pretty good overall; there are better and there are worse.  That's all I got to say about that."}
{"text":"Bomb food as always.  Got a vegas roll,  tootsie maki roll and 2 sake boomers for 2 people all for $24 on happy hour! Service is always great here and the bartender we had was really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"I visited this venue twice and I loved every bit of it. You cannot go wrong with edamame appetizers and some speciality rolls especially the scallop dynamite rolls.. Super delicious .. For drinks go with their signature blushing geisha. Not super strong but a good twist at the end !"}
{"text":"After doing some damage with our credit cards in the mall, we decided to grab a moderately priced lunch. Considering it was the weekend after NYE, it was pretty empty inside. They were able to seat all 9 of us within 5-10 minutes after our entire party arrived.  If I remember correctly, 7 out of 9 of us ordered the Bara Chirashi Bowl. It. Was. So. Good. So much flavor from the poke sauce and it was perfectly filling. I couldn't finish all the rice, but it definitely held me over for our late dinner later that day.  Not sure, if I would come here for the sushi because it seemed more trendy than quality, but the bowl was pretty good."}
{"text":"Good sushi at reasonable prices.  The happy hour menu is good,and has a variety of selections.  The service was good.  they used multiple food runners to get the dishes out quickly.  The server was friendly, and recommended several option for a sushi-phobic friend.  I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I have nothing else than just positive to say about Ra Sushi. Thank you so much for amazing atmosphere, excellent service and delicious food.... Ra Sushi is from my own perspective combination of more than 2 cuisines. Of course Japanese is the main , but they have very interesting ideas to combinate sushi rolls with different cultures,  witch is so amazing.. Thank you Ra Sushi for everything you gave us....  Me and my Wife had such great time and was loving it ...  Thank you so much again...    We love Ta Sushi"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for brunch yesterday. The moment we walked in we got greeted and we got sat down right away. Our server was Lauren (very sweet girl) very attentive the whole time. I'm giving the service 5 stars. The food and alcohol beverages was great as well. Thanks Lauren for your wonderful service."}
{"text":"This location is by far my favorite RA location. The service is always excellent, the food is great, and the atmosphere is always good, even on their busiest days. They also know how to make a killer Tito's Martini also. If you haven't checked out this location, make sure to do so."}
{"text":"Absolute best Martini in town!! Extra dirty, extra olives- our bartender (the good looking Mexican kid with the gages)- created a great drink and an amazing experience!! Such a great time. Awesome sushi too!"}
{"text":"I now know why this place and probably why ALL Ra-Sushi' will never elevate over three stars and these are three lucky stars, as this one in particular doesn't deserve two.   I've been to the Ra-Sushi in South Miami and that one I thought had the worse service, the most despotic malaise. But I didn't walk out. Here, they take the cake they I actually think that they're doing you a favor. Their presence is so much higher than yours. I thought I was amongst queens and kings.    I sat at the bar, a bar where four people were sitting and the lone bartender was just in reverse. I wouldn't mind if I even got the proverbial \"I'll be with you in a second\", five minutes waiting just seemed like an eternity. I got my beer, and then the real weight continue as I saw the bartender just disappear.   I was destined not to order, I know if you put the five minute wait time for a beer in the five minute wait time to place an order would say that doesn't seem so bad on this when you're hungry. And what's worse is attitudinal check you get when you enter ra-sushi. This is something that must be taught at all ra- sushi' , as that's what really perturbing for the South Miami restaurant.  I thought everybody was kind in Scottsdale, and everybody was polite apparently this franchise or this chain just brings out the worst in their employees. Firstly I knew I shouldn't eat here I had such a bad experience at the first ra-sushi, secondly I knew I should've ate we're going to the bar I should've gone to the sushi bar, but the hostess advised me that there was no direct seating at the sushi bar even though it was empty.  As I left I told her I was leaving because the service was so pathetic, she advised me OK have a nice day. What kind of responses was that. Thank you, yeah good bye!!!"}
{"text":"i love authentic japanese and its a good walk from the office! very fresh sashimi and true japanese food! will be back for more!  service is super fast too!"}
{"text":"Love the Las Vegas roll here and the sushi roll wrapped in cucumber. I don't remember what it was called, but it was awesome. I like the setup here too. I would recommend coming here on a weekend (evening) though when the sushi is fresh. Their bathrooms are cool and I liked the granite countertops..."}
{"text":"Out of a lot of fish especially for a Sunday lunch .... The sushi after we received it, was subpar it kind of tasted old and had a sticky residue on it .... The only Good thing I had was the goji roll which was fried shrimp sirracha and other yummy things .... I eat sushi all the time  and coming here made me feel like I knew more Han the Mexican making it..."}
{"text":"I admit it. I used to tell everyone this is the worst restaurant in town. I went here a year ago and had OLD raw fish. I've been to the one in Tucson, which was always top-notch, and I was just really disappointed with this one.  ALL THAT SAID, I went recently and they may have done a 180. I ordered the spicy chicken udon to be safe, which was delicious, but I noticed my friends' sushi rolls actually looked decent.  So, I may give RA another chance."}
{"text":"There are not many restaurants that I have tried in Phoenix that make me roll my eyes at the mention of their name. Ra is one of them. This is sushi for yuppies and wannabes.   Why one star at all? The sushi is slightly more interesting than what you can purchase at a grocery store. Occasionally a very friendly waiter will offer you an experimental off-the-menu roll, but this has happened to me three times, so I suspect it's a ploy similar to how Trader Joe's cashiers talk about how one of your items is their FAVORITE EVER, OMG! The drinks are decent and the business offers lots of perks (I joined their customer club as a favor to a friend...who has bad taste in sushi).  Now the bad stuff. The ambiance is cheaply over-sexed, and not in a clever burlesque way. More like a high school boy-who-fantacizes-about-Laura-Croft way. The menu tries too hard to be cute and sexy. Most of the the wait staff could easily sub at Starbucks or Applebee's. For a place that specializes in sushi, there really is no good excuse for why it's so mediocre. They don't even offer real Japanese wasabi. Half of the time I've ordered, ginger was omitted from my plate. And of course, the miso is that generic brownish stuff that you find in every Japanese-ish place that doesn't care about miso.  Every time I walk near Ra on Mill, I am reminded that I haven't had sushi in a while. Then I glance at it again, and keep walking."}
{"text":"Happy Father's Day!  I got to pick today (it is always a joint decision anyway ;-) and selected this location because it was close to a theatre we were going to.  Upon entering, the first thing you notice is the striking multiple red globes hanging from the ceiling--a very modernistically decorated and beautiful surprise in a restaurant that is part of a strip mall (although a very classy strip mall.)  Our server Chris was young and attentive, and made a few recommendations for us.  We both ordered a starter for a change.  My wife got the edamame wontons (I looked up the correct pronunciation, as a former Japanese language student, and FYI it is ed-AH-mah-may, accent on the second syllable--not ed-ah-MAH-may as Chris and others have prounounced.)  These were five fried won tons wrapped around a mixture of edamame beans, cheese and onions, and they were very different and we were glad we tried them.  I ordered the lobster spring rolls as a huge lobster fan, and there were four of these and they were very tasty as well.  For our entrees we shared the king crab roll, which was very fresh and delicious, and the lobster shrimp roll, which was also very good.  Both were accompanied by a wasabi sauce but I was disappointed that there was not a lot of heat to it.  They were two of the more expensive items on the menu, but the price justified the content.  The meal was made perfect with each of us having a 22 oz. Kirin Ichiban beer to wash it all down.  Manager Mike came by and even offered us free ice cream (reason for the fifth star!), but we were just too stuffed and needed to get to our matinee.  This is a good choice for a rather upscale sushi experience."}
{"text":"I'm never really been a big fan of this place, I just don't define loud music and dimmed out lights a good way to eat my sushi comfortably.  Every time I enter this place I feel like I'm about to pass out by the crowded atmosphere, even though it's not crowded LOL. I just feel overwhelmed with their ambiance, and it's not a great feeling.    Now on their food section, their prices for happy hour isn't too bad.  It ranges from $5 to $7, for sushi and desserts.  I've experienced better sushi, but I didn't mind eating it for the price.  But it's nothing to brag about.  I did like their dessert though, both their fried banana wrapped thing and their Cinnamon Tempura Ice Cream was really good.  I thought the waiter was a not the business though, considering she didn't bother to refill our drinks or take our order within the 15mins we sat down.    If you're looking for a place that has the club like feel while eating a boat load of sushi, then this is your place."}
{"text":"Would be in the negative if I could. Although food was amazing for my 1st time trying sushi. Service was horrible and I mean beyond horrible. Drinks tasted bad waitress didnt even ask if I would have like another. I had to ask her if she wasnt busy if she wouldnt mind grabbing me a drink. Completely ignored by our server I would not go back to this place at all."}
{"text":"Ra was perfect for dinner with the girls. The music was loud so be prepared for a DJ blaring music that you must talk over. We each only bought one roll each which was enough for us as they were bigger rolls. The waitstaff we had was perfect with his timing and the correct level of talking/friendliness without distracting from our own conversations. The manager also checked in to make sure all was well. Great experience!  There is currently construction just outside Ra, but don't let that discourage you from visiting."}
{"text":"I should of checked out their B rating before walking into this sushi place.   First of all, the service was bad. The place was near empty.  We each ordered a roll and such. Took awhile to bring out the water.  Took awhile to bring the beer.[surprisingly cheap...$5 for asahi...not bad: they also have asahi light for $5. And an asahi + sake for 6.50 light and regular]  All of a sudden my sisters bf gets his food[scallop dynamite roll: Amazing. So much flavor]   .....20 minutes later my little brother gets his plate [chicken yakisoba: pretty tasty good portion to share...but the little bro is greedy and ate the entire plate].  Almost an hour after they both get their food....My sister and I get our sushi roll. By that time we were over the entire experience. We had the \"viva las vegas roll\": we had had this before and.....this time it tasted horrible. We also had some \"crispy spicy tuna\" something that tasted like a rice crispy with tuna [gross].   The waitress was treating others much better than us. Racist? HA.Sexist? HA! Jk...       Who knows. Maybe she was taught backwards. Aren't women supposed to be first? Well Missy....get some manners.. If you are working in the field of \"serving me...\" get educated... Some people really should apply at a prison or something. I do not like attitudes. So... yes... Smile and serve me. I'm paying to eat. That includes good service. Thanks to you...I am not coming back."}
{"text":"I was in mood for some Sushi and since I was staying opposite at Wynn, this place was my quickest bet. I went at the bar, and told the bartender I want a quick bite and ordered Dill Salmon sushi roll. Waited 30mins to get a sushi roll but their extremely poor service could not server it still. I had to get up and leave. Pathetic customer service. The manager is tonight 02/15/2016 is useless too. I left the restaurant hungry. They have no regards for the customers so if you have slightest morals you won't go here.  P.S: their avg rating on yelp half truth as many pissed customers don't take the pain to write, due to which these guys are in business still. They should be rated 1star."}
{"text":"Countless great nights/weekends have started here.  Their afternoon happy hour is a great way to kick things off, I believe its from 4:30-7:00 Mon-Thurs.  Tons of great food and drink specials.  Sunday night they have a late night happy hour that starts around 9/10.  Food here is good, drink, HH is amazing and its on the strip!  What more could you ask for."}
{"text":"This place is so disappointing. No napkins, no wasabi and ginger, no water refills, dirty soy dishes, old fish. Seriously, get it together- it used to be a privilege to serve people and to be a part of creating a good experience for your guests. Not here."}
{"text":"Amazing food! the worst service I have ever had. Food takes forever, and never felt made special. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Decided I wanted something different for lunch and what that entails for me is basically driving around until I see something that looks good and on this particular day, Ra caught my attention.  Luckily I was getting a late lunch that day so I knew sushi happy hour was going on!  The place had a decent crowd for 3:30pm on a weekday afternoon but I guess that's probably all due to happy hour, anyway I was able to be seated at the bar right away.  The bartender came over pretty quickly to see what I wanted to drink (water unfortunately as I had to go back to work afterwards) and let me peruse the menu a little bit.  The selection is pretty good, several different options to choose from that our discounted.  I ordered the spicy tuna which is always a safe bet and a couple different nigiri but I can't remember which ones right now.  Everything was good, your typical chain restaurant sushi but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"George the bartender is sick as heck. So is Sam, but George let my lady and I sit down last minute to grab drinks and a couple quick rolls. Love this place and the care they all take of us. Will always come back !"}
{"text":"We decided to branch out of our South Mill lunch routine and hit up RA for specifically for their lunch specials and previous speedy service...and walked into one of the most baffling service experiences ever.  Some of us ordered sushi - which came out quite fast, others ordered other lunch specials that took anywhere between 30 - 50 minutes to come out - if at all.  When 80 percent of our group had their food (40 minutes into our trip), the server asked \"Are you missing anything?\" looking at the two gentlemen who did not receive their food yet and she asked \"What did you order again?\" when they told her she replied with \"Would you like me to go check on that?!\"  at which point most of us were done and ready for the checks - so one decided to for go eating altogether figuring it would take another 30 minutes and the other requested that his food, which was on its way out, be boxed up to go.  The checking out process continued to take quite some time due to tickets needing to be corrected, and the to-go food wasn't up yet.  Finally - 20 minutes later, the food (that had been delivered to the table) was now boxed up and ready - so we headed out.  When we arrived back at the office, the boxed up lunch was in fact incorrect.  All in all, the food was good - the quality for the price of the lunch was good - but the service was ridiculous....."}
{"text":"Went during happy hour with recommendation from my friends. Happy hour menu was decent. It went on from 8PM-12AM. Ordered a lot and bill came out to only $40. Must try the RaKrazy. Especially the Crunchy Calamari Roll for the price it's worth it. I would recommend it and go back definitely."}
{"text":"I've only been to this Ra once or twice, but I think the price is overestimated here.  Maybe people are having too much Sake.  The service is decent, ambiance is very faux Japanese-American deal.  Sushi is pretty good and if you go during happy hour it's a steal.  Sake and Kirin is like 3 or 4 bucks and you can get a thing of Sake for $1.  They have a nice patio sitting area to people watch. Great place if you want to catch a friend for lunch or do dinner and a movie."}
{"text":"I always come here once a week great food but servers need to step up the service they would check on a table & go back to the computer station. Usually places they check up on all the tables. But other than that great looking females good for business making guys coming to eat with the ladies."}
{"text":"I went here twice over the weekend, once in Scottsdale and once here in Chandler on ray. I must say I think the service is indeed better at the one on Ray, food taste more as it should here too. I had their vegas roll, totally delicious! I love the happy hour here more than anything! Ill be returning again and again...  I'm glad I finally found a sushi place that almost can hold it's own against the ones I frequented in CA."}
{"text":"I did not think Ra was that great the past few times I've been.  It has that \"trendy\" vibe to it, which I think is way overrated.  Being a food whore, I care more about my food than my ambiance.  Ra appears to cater to people who are looking for Americanized Japanese food.  The food is not great, but neither is it truly terrible.  The atmosphere is cutesy, but I like more chill and unpretentious restaurants.  I'm pretty sure that Scottsdale has to have better sushi than what can be found at Ra."}
{"text":"Its a dump. Mind you - a very nicely decorated dump. If you wish to hang out and yell over music with out much care what goes in your mouth then this place is for you. If you care about your food you should get in your car and go elsewhere, as this is not a place for Sushi/Rolls lovers. Its mediocre at the very best. Bleah.   \"I dunt like\" Eugene"}
{"text":"I'm so torn on RA. (I know. I'm a brave person, getting up and going to work everyday and functioning with such a heavy load on my shoulders.)  Really though...I feel like I should have outgrown RA by now, but I haven't. I initially went to the Tempe location back in the day when I was 18 and hated sushi (forgive me, I was young and stupid. Mostly stupid) and ate noodles every time I was forced to go there by my ex or my friends. Now I am pretty well-versed on the sushi world and eat it every chance I get.  No, RA is not the best sushi restaurant in town. No, it is not the most authentic. But it always draws me back in. The happy hour, the drinks (Umami Punch, you are my liquid soulmate), the special rolls...I can't help myself. (\"I wish I knew how to quit you\"...)  I WANT to hate RA, mostly due to the douchebags it tends to attract, at ANY of the locations (we live in 'Tukee now, so obviously we frequent this location a lot), but I still can't. We went a few weeks ago for happy hour with some friends, and it was busy (of course). No biggie, we sat at the bar and had a drink or two while waiting for our table. They told us 15-30 minutes and we realized it had been longer than that...went up to check on our spot and lo and behold, our buzzy-thingy was not working and they had skipped us on the list and because of this, have missed the happy hour cutoff. NOOO! I needed me some cheap dranks and sushi! We sat down, the waitress talked to the manager about what happened, and the manager came over and talked to us, apologized, and let us know any food we ordered (sadly not alcohol as well, but I understand why not) would still be happy hour pricing. Pretty cool, as some places would have had a pretty \"oh well\" attitude about it.  Overall, RA is like crack, and once you've had it, you'll develop a habit you just can't kick. Pass the soft shell crab roll, please..."}
{"text":"I don't usually do reviews but I had to for this one. A bartender named Lex at RA Sushi. This is only my second time in and the last time was a few months ago. She remembered my face from those months ago and even remembered that I had left my bag there that night and went to check if they still had it. Unfortunately they did not still have it. My fault for not going back to check but she offered to buy me a drink in reference to losing the bag and told me they should've been better about keeping my property even though I told her it was my fault. Not many bartenders remember people from months ago but she did and it makes me want to come back more and more.  I'm only coming back because of her and of course the food but mainly her good service. Thanks again Lex."}
{"text":"I came here twice back in March 2010 during my visit here for San Francisco Giants Spring Training. I'd like to think my decision to go for the first time that year brought them luck because we finally won our first World Series Championship in San Francisco that year. :)  Anyway, I want to give this restaurant belated credit for their hot miso soup. It was wonderful. Living in San Francisco, we have a lot of Japanese restaurants here in the City and surrounding communities, and so far I have not encountered one that serves that or anything remotely similar. It was definitely a unique creation that I enjoyed and occasionally think about giving that my two visits there during my trip there were the only times I ever had it.  If I travel there for Giants Spring Training or other reasons, hopefully this restaurant will still be here and have it on the menu."}
{"text":"There are so many sushi joints in Old Town that it's taken me a year to get to this one.  The vibe is trendy, but not overly pretentious.  I was happy to find that they offer Happy Hours for food and drink until 7 pm.    I opted for spicy salmon and it was delicious.  Fresh salmon and nice and simple.  Were the rolls huge? No.  Kinda skimpy as compared to other venues in the area.  I also tried the crispy spicy tuna. I wasn't impressed. Now normally I am a basic sushi person. Meaning, I don't really get into the mayonnaise, cream cheese, fried, etc types; but I thought I'd give it a shot.  I wish I hadn't.   First, 4 pieces. That's it.  Although I wouldn't have finished an entire roll because it was soggy.  There was no crispiness at all.  I did try my friends' pineapple wonton and it was delicious.  Overall there are other sushi places that have better prices and better sushi."}
{"text":"I stopped by for some sushi before a meeting and this place looks great! Say at the sushi bar and they have very friendly chefs. Requested lite rice on a rainbow roll and it came out perfectly! Will definitely be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have never been disappointed. Their service is exemplar. Their food is out of this world delicious. Every time I come to Las Vegas, I make it a point to come here and enjoy good sushi."}
{"text":"The food was alright. I had Ra when I still lived in Chicago at the Glenview location. For some reason, I think the Glenview location had a better Vegas Roll. The shrimp and lobster roll was pretty good though. Very expensive. I miss the Glenview location's happy hour where there were price drops on the sushi."}
{"text":"Went to RA for a birthday dinner, unfortunately they said they wouldn't do anything for it. It took about 5 minutes to get greeted then another 10 minutes just to get appetizers. Service was a little slow, however the food was good."}
{"text":"This sushi place was just okay. My gf and I wanted to go shopping and were super hungry! The only sushi place that showed up near us with a decent dollar sign was this one. Like all Vegas restaurants, the food is pricy. What makes restaurants in Vegas so good is that they are ALL suppose to taste good...especially if the ambiance looks fancy!   RA Sushi Bar was just decent. I wasn't wow-ed away by any of the sushi rolls my gf and I shared. We got 3 rolls:   RA Lollipop: It was basically wrapped in rice paper with raw fish on the inside. I wasn't a fan of the sauce it came with because it enhanced the fish taste when I dipped it in. The presentation was nice. It rolls came on a stick so that it could emulate the \"lollipop\" look.   Lobster Shrimp Roll: Couldn't really find the lobster or taste the lobster flavor in this roll. It seemed more like of a California roll topped with shrimp. Not only that if you dip the roll in the pesto sauce it comes with, the sauce overpowers the flavor so you couldn't have been able to tatse the lobser with the pesto taste covering it. Also the shrimp wasn't a bright pink color like I am used to. It looked kinda dead...   Viva Las Vegas Roll: Honestly the best thing about this roll was the eel sauce it was drenched with. That's about it!   Okay sushi place, I've had better!"}
{"text":"YESSIR! Great food & great services.  Parking..ahhh!"}
{"text":"the slow service here should warrant a 2-star review, but where else can you get quality orders of nigiri sushi for $6 or less? i bought bottles of water more expensive than that in las vegas.  if you're looking for a good sushi dinner without breaking the bank, go here and just schedule an extra 30 mins into your evening to account for the fact that this restaurant needs another waiter or two... it will be worth it"}
{"text":"This place is okay. I really liked the Crunchy Spicy Tuna. It's fried rice cakes with spicy tuna on top. The seared ahi tuna  dinner was not good at all. I barely had a couple bites. It was very tough and overcooked. Definitely more than seared. It might have been better if it was thinly sliced for me.   Our server was very nice and came back often to refill our water glasses.  50% off some appetizers and sushi (including the Crunch Spicy Tuna) makes this place worthwhile during happy hour which lasts until 7pm.  Don't come here if you don't like loud music! Seems like they're trying to be a club as well as restaurant."}
{"text":"I LOVE RA. I Love it. Why?  Because they are consistent. I know  that whatever I order will be the same as last time. It's not pretentious like other sushi joints...except during after hours when the DJ is there. All I want is fresh fish mixed with fresh vegetables and other fresh delicious ingredients. I have always had a good experience here. I can't talk about other locations but this one delivers. I like to keep my wife here for date night/afternoon. If you want to beat the crowds, go here on reverse happy hour like Sunday from three to close. Can't beat it. Everything is fresh and fast. And, I can sample many different items at half the price. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I love sushi + My friend loves sushi + RA emails us coupons + RA is nearby our offices = Lunch at RA.  These reasons are no longer enough for me to go to this location. The sushi rolls are so dry and lackluster that even dousing them in soy sauce doesn't help. The service is so slow that we have to order our drinks, food, and ask for the bill as soon as the waitress comes by after 20 minutes of sitting. Even after telling them we have a short lunch, I still find myself leaving way too late. Good thing I have such a lovely companion to keep me company while we wait.  No more second, third, or fourth chances, RA."}
{"text":"We literally stood in the entrance for 15min and the hostess never showed up as people kept piling in. And the security staff standing there gave no explanation as to why NO ONE was present to seat people. Just stood there. So we left. I can see why it has such low ratings..."}
{"text":"The sushi is always fresh, delicious, and the presentation is fantastic. I would recommend the Albacore Nigiri - it is amazing! The menu has a very large selection of both sushi and non-sushi. I've also tried the teriyaki chicken and it was delicious. If this review was based off of food alone, I'd give it 5 stars. However, the wait staff is really hit or miss - keep your fingers crossed that you'll get one of the more attentive employees. Secondly, if you like eating in a Scottsdale club, you'll love the insanely loud music and inability to have a normal conversation without shouting and leaning in to talk in someone's ear. I'd personally like to come here more often, but the fact that I know whoever I'm with won't really be able to have a normal conversation without shouting limits my visits. It's a good thing their food is so delicious!"}
{"text":"visitng from san Jose, I was looking for a good Sushi spot. My best friend who lives in LV suggested this spot. OMG!! it was awesome! Lobster rolls, viva las vegas and spicy califonia oh my!! :D Delicious!! Not to mention have price. The Dj was good and played good music. On my next visit I will definately be hitting up this spot :D"}
{"text":"Based solely on the quality of the food and my desire to want to go back for a normal dinner night, I'd probably wind up at around three stars for RA.   HOWEVER, I must then factor in their amazing happy hour (Mon-Sat 3-7pm, unheard of!), which includes a huge list of sushi dishes and appetizers for about $3-7, plus some amazing deals on sake and beer. Add to that the friendly patience of our servers while our enormous group kept ordering and drinking, then drinking and ordering some more, and the total shock at how low the check was at the end of a couple of hours of fun, and I can't help but upgrade to four stars.   It's rare that you go out with a big group, drink and eat to your heart's content, and then are surprised at how little you end up paying. So for that, I salute you RA!"}
{"text":"Ra's happy hour is a fantastic place to start an evening in Vegas off right! While the strip is lined with super fancy overpriced restaurants featuring celebrity chefs, this one's a lot more low-key and it just a casual, fun place to get some cheap food and drinks before splurging elsewhere.   Their happy hour is from 3-7pm and features some amazing deals like $2 sake, $3 beers and a huge menu of discounted food including a yummy carpaccio, chicken wings, and big honkin' sushi rolls.   We begged for a table on the patio and after a wait at the bar we got our wish, and it was wonderful to be out there on a warm night doing sake bombs and pigging out on not-too-heavy food before a night of dancing. If you're with your girlfriends I highly recommend a tipsy shopping trip in the attached mall after your drinks... drunk shopping is fun!"}
{"text":"RA has been a long standing favorite for us.   In recent months we have gone less though.   The food is always good but sometimes boring, because the menu doesn't change much.   We went a couple nights ago,  because i had a coupon for a free roll from a previous visit where some of our order was never delivered.   We asked if there were seasonal menu items.  They only had seasonal drinks,  no new menu items.  We have found another local sushi restaraunt with a great menu so I don't know that we will be coming to RA as much anymore.   We used to get fantastic service,  where the servers/ bartenders knew our drink order and how we like our flow to go (I've had gastric sleeve surgery so can't eat and drink at the same time,  we order drinks then wait awhile to start ordering food).  Many of those servers are gone and we just haven't had anyone that was outstanding.   RA is ok, but just nothing special."}
{"text":"This is definitely a more commercialized and slightly pricier place for sushi, but they have amazing happy hour. Everything I've ever had here has been delicious and the service is always friendly!"}
{"text":"It was pretty bad overall. We came in around 12:30PM on Sunday and there were only 2 other tables in the place. We felt rushed even though we said we wanted/asked to take our time. The appetizers came our and the waitress immediately returned with our lunch specials. The pineapple cheese wontons hardly had any filling. We paid $8.30 for for of them. I would have been mad even paying $4. We still had food on our plate when the waitress came back and started to clear them. Bye half of my lunch. Next we ordered the fried ice cream for desert and it just seemed dry and crumbly. To top it off when we were asked for the 3rd time if we wanted to pay our bill, as soon as the waitress walked away I was so annoyed so I put down cash and left. The waitress saw us get up to leave and ran to the the table to make sure we weren't dining and dashing. I guess maybe that happens a lot here since the place was overall quite bad. I have been to Ra many times before in Tucson and it was much better. Not sure if this location is just off or if the quality overall at this chain is slipping. Either way we won't be back."}
{"text":"We love Ra! If you go, ask for Nate! He is the best of the best of servers!! If Nate was cloned... the customer service industry would be completely over the top! Nate is always smiling happy to help and never breaks a sweat!!! If you look up happy, fun, loves life, loves everyone in it and completely and utterly passionate...that's Nate!!!   He is the BEST!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what the issues were with the other reviewers.  Yes Ra tries to be hip, they've been that way for TEN YEARS.  Every location looks different but the all have the same things in common: Loud music, Good lookling staff.  The sushi is good, i've had better, but 1 star? I don't get it.  Mary took the time to explain to my wife the different kinds of Sake they offer and what makes them different.  The food did not take forever, is 20 minutes really that long?  Maybe these reviewers should give the place another chance."}
{"text":"Arguably, I like this place.  The people and staff are a 10/10! And while I'm one for preferring authentic asian food, this place offers an amazing culinary experience for asian fusion japanesy sushi.  I like it."}
{"text":"I like RA. Not love it. and especially not this RA. I actually hate this RA. It is loud, annoying and like everyone else says the servers are RUDE! I only go for happy hour cause then its decently priced. When I do go we go to the one in Ahwatukee or on Baseline/Val Vista...those have much better ambiance then this place. At the Happy Hour prices the food is def affordable and worth it."}
{"text":"If your going to RA, I would recommend choosing another location. I frequently visit the Awahtukee spot, which is really great, and this chain let me down. Not only did the restaurant seem pretty worn, the food was awful. The shrimp dynamite roll was a greasy, soggy mess of mostly heavy cream sauce with a few scallops over rice pieces - disgusting. When the waitress asked how the dish was and I expressed my disappointment, you would think you would get an offer to send it back or pick something else. Nope....just a blank look of confusion (but she was really nice). I had then ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll, which I have had many times at other locations, but something was not quite right at this place. The pieces were a lot smaller and not evenly tempura battered. I'm in no way a sushi snob, but I was pretty upset that I spent a good amount of dough for a crappy meal. On the plus side, the waitress treated my son with complimentary gelato. If I ever decide to visit RA again, it won't be here."}
{"text":"Best RA location in AZ. Always get great service and great sushi consistently. I can't say that for the Scottsdale locations. Also can't beat the happy hour deals and the specials when you join their loyalty club. One more perk - they are the only place you can find Orion for your sake bomber instead of Kirin, etc."}
{"text":"This was the first time that I can ever recall me dining in this location. My buddy had been here a few times before. I am so glad that he talked me into dining here on Wednesday late afternoon, April 26th, 2017. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted immediately and did not have to wait at all. The hostesses were very friendly and personable!. The asked us for our seating preference. We chose the dining room area facing the beautiful Las Vegas Strip!  Within one minute of being sat, Justine our food server introduced herself. She had a bright smile and very friendly! She asked had we been here before and I replied it was my first time at this location, but my buddy said he had been here before. She was very engaging as we chatted for a few minutes regarding cocktails and appetizers. She offered some great suggestions. I asked her what was her favorite sushi on the menu? She recommended to me the \"Crunchy Calamari Roll, which was absolutely delicious. My friend ordered a Japanese Beer and Seared Tuna. The seared tuna was also delicious. We also ordered the Calamari Tempura which was outstanding! It was also Happy Hour while we were there! As we enjoying our entrees, I noticed the manager passing by with an awesome looking dish that smelled great. I asked him what was that? He mentioned it was called the RA Ckin Shrimp and the aioli sauce that it came with. I wanted to get Justine's opinion about it and she pointed it out in the menu and went over some of the ingredients in it. I said it sounds great so lets order that! When it arrived, it too was incredibly delicious as well!  Trust me, we both were very \"Happy Campers!\"  Everything was amazing and very nice portion sizes.   We both will be back here at this location within the next month or so thanks to Justine, our food server who had some great up-selling and suggestive selling techniques. She was very engaging with us and with the other guest that were around us. She interacted very well with each table. She made sure that we were completely satisfied with every dish, by doing check backs after a few bites. All her recommendations were winners with us! The ambience of the dining room was very alluring and the outer patio was very unique too as you overlooked the strip! Always great to see the managers out on the floors assisting the dining staff and interacting with the guest! This was truly an amazing dining experience. My compliments to the Chef and his cooking staff on a job well done! Thanks again JUSTINE!!! I will ask for her on my next visit!"}
{"text":"absolutely loved it here! The happy hour is great, servers were very nice and the price point is great for the great surroundings.   Does anyone know how it is with larger parties here? I would like to go with about 10 guests for my birthday during the happy hour but wasnt sure if they had good spacing for that?"}
{"text":"Totally mediocre sushi, again. And by \"again\" I mean, this is my 2nd visit to Ra in three years, and it hasn't gotten any better. Attended happy hour. Three items, totaling $22. Most AYCE's around town are in that range, but that's just a sidenote.   RA'kin Shrimp - this was the best out of the three. Lobster egg rolls: no lobster flavor, it was just fried mushy cream cheese logs. The Viva Las Vegas Roll - oh please. Was a faux California roll (only the krab), tempura-fried, with I think what was supposed to be spicy tuna on top, then a tarot slice garnish. Disappointing. I just ate the spicy tuna mix on top, and even with that, I've had much better. I'm used to really good, if not great, sushi. Another disappointing Vegas restaurant experience. Too bad we lost Cafe BaBaReeba. Should have lost RA instead. Ptttht.  Good service earned that one star.  Note: Looks like all the happy hour prices have been upped by a buck since any Yelp reviews you see prior to 2011."}
{"text":"Far from the best sushi spot in the valley, but still consistent and decent.  RA is certainly still doing something right as it continues to grow into a major chain across the country, and continues to be an \"it\" place in old town when there has been a huge increase in competition over the years.  RA is a fun spot to grab a drink and some food.  Prices may be a little high when you're not eating during happy hour, but the service is top notch.  RA is as good a place as any to start your night when in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour! Great sushi and great garlic sesame wings! Also, the calamari crunch roll is good!! I recommend this place! :) service was also really good as well! Thank you!"}
{"text":"Hit up Happy Hour and sit outside. Maybe not the best sushi, but you can't beat the specials and the people-watching."}
{"text":"The Vegas roll was amazing, and the coconut creme brûlée was excellent. Brittany is an excellent server, the best food and service I've had in the three weeks that I've been visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"Not a bad sushi happy hour on the strip!  After a day full of shopping at Fashion Show Mall, RA Sushi is a good place to wind down and enjoy drinks and apps during their happy hour. There are drink/food items starting at less than $4. They have seating indoors and outdoors, so when it gets nice outside, it's great to be seated right on the Las Vegas strip.   During happy hour, which I recall being from 4-7, their hot sake is only $3.75. You can do sake bombs (sake + Kirin) for $8, which is a little pricier than other sushi happy hours I've been to (but not bad for the strip). For food I'd recommend their Shishito peppers (so good when they're spicy) and their Viva Las Vegas roll. Yum!   I've tried their sashimi bowl for lunch before and it wasn't anything special. The sashimi didn't taste very fresh. The service here can also get a little slow when they're busy. You'll be calling the server over rather than having them come check up on you.   Overall, a convenient sushi happy hour if you're already at Fashion Show Mall."}
{"text":"I used to love Ra. Now they changed their menus into items that aren't better. The Tuna Tataki was my favorite and now its different. They are okay but I would pick other spots before ending up at Ra."}
{"text":"las vegas rolls are AWESOME, the servers though are so rude. that is all"}
{"text":"Its a great spot for a quick inexpensive lunch. My friend and I came here on a Tuesday for lunch and enjoyed the spicy tuna roll lunch specual which included a soup and salad. They had the perfect portions, though I would say that they could have added a little more of the ginger dressing to my salad which was basically dry, but our waitress was quick and efficient and brought back a big bowl of the salad dressing.  All in all the service was great and I would come back."}
{"text":"Order delivery.   The food never showed up.   When I called in to ask about my food.   GrubHub was completely useless.  And the Hostess at Ra was extremely rude.  She kept on insisting that it's not their fault and it's grubhub that never came to pick it up.   Terrible service and waste of time"}
{"text":"This is your average sushi place. There isn't anything unique or special about it unless you sit on the patio and are able to people watch. The waitress was very young and kept forgetting to bring things out. The food came pretty quick. The sushi roll we had I did not like. I'm not sure why sushi places have to fancy up traditional roles, I feel it takes away from the main flavor. The presentation on the role was fancy but there was too much going on and the flavors (in my opinion) did not jive well together. The spring roles were delicious, the sauce that accompanied the roles was mediocre. I would try this place again but be more selective on my choices."}
{"text":"I had a good experience here, granted I was with hungry friends but personally only ordered a mango martini.  Yum to the mango martini.  Went around 9 at night, music wasn't loud, place wasn't crowded, loved the lighting/red glow/ambiance. Def made everyone look more attractive :)"}
{"text":"Sushi was great. Unfortunately though, the service was crappy.  We stood there waiting to be seated for at least ten to fifteen minutes and almost wondered if we're supposed to seat ourselves or just leave as there was no hostess at the front desk. Once seated our waitress had to come over two times in a row to remember she already took our orders and drinks order as she forgot. The sushi was great quality and absolutely delicious. The time for the check came and we were given someone elses check and had to point it out that this wasn't ours and then had to be given the correct check. So I mean not completely terrible just annoying in general."}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food. We love coming here because I can get a bento box while my husband can enjoy sushi (I'm not a fan of sushi so I really appreciate somewhere that serves both great food and great sushi)."}
{"text":"This place is nothing special.  Just like every other RA, the food is okay and the atmosphere is asian inspired.  There are better places to eat around the Old Town Scottsdale area.  I say skip this and try something else like the Orange Table."}
{"text":"I like Ra, but not it's not on my top 5 list for sushi places.  This location on Mill is always way to loud and dark.  There was one occasion we couldn't even read the menus.  It is not a good place to go if you want to have a conversation.  The sushi is okay, but too expensive compared to other sushi places in the area.  BUT!  The location cannot be beat.  We like to hike A Mountain, then follow it up with some beers and rolls.  Being on Mill Ave, parking can be a bit of a bear too.  Unless you luck out and get the spot right out front.  That happened once and my waiter offered to put more quarters in my meter so we could enjoy our meal.  The front bar is quieter than the back part where the \"restaurant\" section is located so it makes it more tolerable."}
{"text":"I've been to Ra a few times and the sushi is alright.  I usually go for the happy hour drinks because the specials are good. The last time I went though the service was HORRIBLE.  My cousin and I sat down and the server came up and asked for our drinks and food and when we told her we were not eating she told us the we were NOT ALLOWED to sit in the dining room so we ordered edemame.  She also kept coming up and asking if or other guests were coming or not because she wanted to take the menus. It was very wierd. Also the two times I have been there the place has smelled like mildew. I dont think I will go back."}
{"text":"I was eating here the other day with a friend and I usually don't leave negative reviews because I get some people may have their bad days, but in this case particular, the young man that was serving us couldn't have given us worse service.  We were sat and immediately he ran up to us and asked if we're ready to order? Like where's our menus first? It wasn't busy, there were maybe 3 other tables. After we said we needed a minute (cause I've never been here before, idk what to order) he had an attitude, rolled his eyes, and stormed off. As if he was on a time crunch.  After we ordered our drinks he proceeded to slam my drink on my table causing all this water to spill out. He's a buff dude so I'm sure it wasn't that heavy lol Didn't even apologize and just hurried away, straight faced. Then throughout our meal he kept bothering us with this bad attitude. It was like the only reason he was checking on us was because it's the bare minimum of his job. This guy had NO CHARISMA, didn't smile at us once, just grumpy cat face *meme*  I didn't even get to enjoy my food because I felt so pressured to leave. He obviously didn't want to be at work that day, let alone be serving us. So we ended up tipping like 35% , left a nice bible verse on actions and being kind, so the next people who he waited on hopefully didn't get the grumpy fart personality that we got."}
{"text":"We came during Happy Hour, and it was the cheapest meal we had in Vegas. I had the Viva Las Vegas Roll, and was stuffed. That thing is heavy duty.  Boyfriend had the crispy tuna roll and the spicy yellowtail roll. That crispy tuna roll is amazing. It was my favorite. The spicy yellowtail...good, but not spicy at all.   We also had the pineapple cream cheese wontons, and they were gross. But our waitress took them off the bill immediately when we handed back the plate with all but one wonton.   Of course this place isn't traditional, just take a look at it! But it was fun, cheap, yummy and made for great people watching."}
{"text":"Puddles of liquid on the bathroom floor which I had to step in to use the urinal, faucet in bathroom didn't work, had to wipe soap off my hands with a paper towel, service was horrendous. Sushi is just mediocre, would not recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for tasty sushi in Ahwatukee, it's pretty tough to compete with RA. Yes, it's a franchise, but willing to overlook that.  My favorite part about this place is happy hour . . . On the Sushi, that is! But of course, there's drinks. Years ago, it used to be a regular event for my girlfriends and I during the week!   There's so many different types of rolls on the happy our menu which makes it difficult to choose.   I'm a big fan of their Viva Las Vegas, Tootsy Maki, Spicy Tuna and Rainbow Rolls. You  can't go wrong with any of the Nigiri.   I also LOVE their Spicy Miso Soup. If you find yourself sick, get this to-go. Your sinuses will thank you.   Drinks? The Blushing Geisha and Samurai Cowboy.   Service can be pretty hit or miss, but \"miss\" so few and far between I'm willing to overlook that.   Always look forward to a RA adventure after seeing a movie!"}
{"text":"This is a greattttttt place for amazing sushi right on the strip, beautiful scenery, clean bathrooms, &&&&&&& fresh food pure deliciousness, life & sushi doesn't get better then this.. happy hour hits the spot the las vegas roll and the ponzu chicken wings are to die for. Definitely a place to put on ur restaurant bucket list..... Servers was great hands on. Even the manager stop by & chat for a little bit.. ill be back every time I visit vegas.."}
{"text":"Yesterday after a annoying advising session at ASU I met a friend at RA for lunch. Sure Ra is a bit over rated, and I would have preferred to try another sushi joint, but they are consistent and on Mill. Stevey is right about the Monopoly.   What I couldn't believe is how busy it was! School isn't in session, but Ra is still packed with college students and power lunches. My friend Jennifer and I had our normal cali, philly, and we tried the snow crab roll. YUCK! Snow crab was not good! We both like crab to if that answers your question. I think the main problem with the roll is that it wasn't really a roll. It was a long piece of crab meat tied to rice with seaweed. Where is the originality? Had they used more flavor and less crab it would have tasted a lot better.   Service is what was to expected for how slammed they were. I look forward to discovering some new sushi places in Tempe come August!"}
{"text":"Came here the other day to grab a light dinner before the Dave Attell Show at the TI with some friends. The food and service were good and the Kirin and Saki flowed freely. Prices seemed high for what you get but it was being expensed by a friend otherwise I would not go somewhere as tourist/trendy for Japanese food. Everyone enjoyed themselves, then it was off to the show!"}
{"text":"Gave Ra two chances.  Still do not like the atmosphere, nor the food.  What's with the loud music?  Perhaps it's management hoping that I won't notice how awful the food is by painfully triggering my eardrums.    The noodle soup, the title of which goes something like... $14 bowl of soup (I don't know, it was so noisy, I couldn't think!) was TERRIBLE.  I really can't expound on why I found it disgusting.  All I remember as I tasted the broth and noodles was a flashback of Warner Bros. cartoons where a character (was it Bugs Bunny?) was shoveling paper money into a burning fireplace.  Total waste of money.  Mom didn't like the soup, as well.    A coworker of mine and I met here for happy hour and tried many apps, which I do admit were nicely priced.  The low prices aren't enough to get me to return, however.  The one plate I remember liking, so much so that I ordered it twice (we were very hungry) was made of tofu.  I even wrote it down and asked for it at my favorite sushi resto, but they didn't know what it could be, much less replicate it.  Since I'm not much of a drinker, I cannot discuss happy hour drink specials as I only drink water- I rarely order alcohol because I prefer to eat my calories.   Sayona-Ra!"}
{"text":"We stopped by this past sunday night after I found out a good friend was working there and he INSISTED that I stop by.  I'm actually glad I did.  I bumped into some other friends who used to live in SF so it gave us a chance to catch up.  Now, I'm not big on seafood at all but I will say, the drinks, potstickers and the chicken yakatori were all top notch (and my friends that ordered rolls said they were great).  It wasn't too packed either so we didn't have to wait at all, the music was good and we just had a good time overall.  Next time I'm in town, I'm definitely stopping through when we have more time instead of just stopping by right before we're hitting the clubs.  Thanks Shaun, see you in a few months."}
{"text":"I always appreciate when a place has reverse happy hour.  I love the pineapple wantons I literally would just have those as my dinner.  The location is right in the middle of old town which makes it a perfect place for dinner and drinks before a night out."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and not my choice.  I don't have any reason why this would be on my list of choices for sushi.  It's loud, obnoxious crowd, and way too expensive!"}
{"text":"Love sushi, not loving Ra.   Stopped by on Saturday night on a whim for pre-concert eats. Asked to sit at the sushi bar, as I planned to be in and out quickly.   Here's a brief summary of the \"misses\": -spicy tuna roll was sloppy, ill-formed.  -warm, mushy, borderline inedible spicy tuna mix. WAY too much mayo. It was creamy with the texture of over-cooked oatmeal. -spicy yellowtail roll was a little less warm, little less sloppy. Didn't have the appearance of canned cat food.   Arguably, I could have brought this to the attention of the sushi chef, but he didn't speak English well and I was in a hurry to get to the show. My server was polite and brought several refills of water and the check was prompt. The cost was a little high for me, $7.50 for basic rolls, ending up at $15 plus tax for my meal.  I'm not one to jump to conclusions, but I felt very ill the rest of the night-- sweating, feeling dizzy and nauseous. It's likely I'll be in the area again, and if I feel like giving Ra another shot, I will definitely hope for a better experience."}
{"text":"Service is really good, friendly, and quick.  The food is so-so......  We sat at the sushi bar and the sushi chefs are very attentive and quick, however the quality and selection of sashimi isn't as good.  We ordered the rockin shrimp appetizer..... it was pretty good..... The spice on the shrimp was good, but overcooked. Garlic Edamome is really good!! The King Crab Salad was really good, chopped lettuce, cucumber, tomato, avocado, and some good size pieces of King Crab. This was yummy! The Sashimi selection was tuna, salmon, and yellowtail. It was okay.... not really good.... not bad... just okay....  Neighboring sushi bar patron had an amazing looking sashimi salad that he was raving about."}
{"text":"Go somewhere else!  Seriously unless you have time to sit with no food, drink or service!  Our waitress forgot about us!  Why did we have to hunt her down to pay?! Even when the hostess found her we still had to wait to pay.  And I had to go to another table to get soy sauce cuz she never ever came back after---finally--bringing our food.  And why does edamame come out last!   Since when?!!!!  In an area where there are so many choices we will be kind to ourselves and go somewhere else.  Also super slow to get drinks.  Can't understand it when the restaurant is not busy at all..wings were good but doesn't outweigh the suck feeling of being neglected!"}
{"text":"For LV on a budget with varity, the Happy Hour is ok here.  For example, 2 pieces of Salmon sushi is $3 (Regular $6).  For quality, it is more like a below fair to fair.  The fish is toward the try dry side and without much flavor.  The sushi rice texture is amature/wrong/chewy/tasteless.  The atmosphere is loud and fun.  You can see Wynn right across of the street in the bar area.  However, you cannot see your food because it is so dark and red all around.  If there is a  alien item on your sushi, you will put that in your mouth.  Service equals to the pricey you pay.  Meaning, you will get your food your ordered within a timely manner.  For example... The waitress will ask, \"How's your food?\"  Before you hear the complete sentence, she is already gone.  Conclusion, cheap eat and not very good food."}
{"text":"Seems like a nice place if you just have to have sushi and you don't want to leave the strip. I would not seek this place out though. We had a variety of sushi rolls and none were bad, but neither were any of them great"}
{"text":"My husband and I had eaten here for lunch on a previous visit to Vegas. But this time, we tried a dinner visit. We went on a Sunday night when they were having their Happy Hour.  We were quite happy!  We had to wait for our table so waited at the bar. They also had drink specials and the service was fast even though busy.  The prices for the happy hour menu are 50% off and they have quite a lot of items on the happy hour menu. Drinks, Appetizers, Sushi and dinner items. We got drinks, apps and sushi. We ordered about 10 different things plus drinks and our bill with tip was $80 - this is damn reasonable for this much food and drinks in Vegas.  My favorite items were:  Apps: pineapple cheese wontons (YUM!) Sushi: Gojira roll (say with 50s movie Japanese accent) and Crispy Spicy Tuna roll   Plus the simple tuna nigiri was delicious - very fresh!   It was crowded but the service was excellent. The waitress was always by to make sure we were good. Plus when one of our last rolls was taking a long time, she gave us another on the house.   We go for lunch for the yummy spicy tuna bowls (highly recommended)  but I now also recommend for dinner.   They had good music playing for dinner and for lunch I was able to watch ESPN Sports Center :)"}
{"text":"Stopped here for happy hour which is the best time to go.  The food was great as always! Everything was fresh. I especially enjoyed the seared tuna.    However what I really want to mention is that we had possibly the best service ever!   When we walked in there was no one at the hostess stand but I figured it was slow. A gentleman, I think his name might have been Isaac, acknowledged us and let us choose where to sit. He was incredibly polite. I asked if there was anywhere I could charge my phone (because I needed to yelp this experience) and he offered to plug it in for me without giving me attitude!! That was pretty exciting...   He answered all our questions and was incredibly helpful. I noticed as people began to come in no one was at the hostess stand but he quickly acknowledged customers from behind the bar. It seemed as though he was the only one working there. Looking at the other reviews it seems like Ra could use more employees like this!"}
{"text":"You cannot beat this place especially during Happy Hour.  This is the best we have been to in Las Vegas.  The food is excellent no matter what time of day you go, but the best deals are during happy hour.  We have never had bad service or food here and the drinks (if you drink) are very reasonably priced.  The deserts are not on happy hour, but are around the same price as everything that is on happy hour and is worth the poundage.  If you are in Vegas, this is a place you have to visit."}
{"text":"RA is awful. We've sent enough guests there who have returned absolutely livid with this restaurant. No serious complaints about the food, but the service is just atrocious. I admit I'm mildly addicted to the ginger dressing they use on their side salads, but the methadone for that addiction is my abhorrence for the service. I will never go back here, but I may just convince my significant other to pick me up a side salad."}
{"text":"RA sushi is only great when you want to see drunk tourists do body shots off each other and then proceed to high-five one another. Then stumble out of the restaurant hilariously. Unlike a lot other Yelpers, I didn't find their food that great. I think RA uses dim red lighting and Britney Spears remixes as a distraction for their food.   Wait time was unnecessarily long. One of the hostess was clad in sweat pants and tee. I'm all for casual, but girl was straight up homebody status, foreals. Their lobster roll was laced with lots of lettuce leaves. Lobster was almost non-existent. Chicken wings were meh. Overall, the food was alright but it was overpriced. Beer and cocktails were fine. Food service was fine and efficient.  I tell you what, there are better places to get your sushi in Vegas. Like Sushi-Mon, Sushi Wa, Spicy Tuna, or Shuseki (Chinatown)."}
{"text":"Sean, the temporary manager, your service and management skills are awful.     I wish I could give you negative stars with a nice f you on the side   Normally I would really enjoy myself at this location, the sushi and drinks are okay but I will never go back because of Sean and the hostess last night, Rav? Raph? Whoever you are, please treat people the way you'd like to be treated. Why is an 18 year old working in the bar area, finally asking if I need help, when you actually cannot help me at all? My drinks sat open behind the bar for at least ten minutes, I had to go inside myself to find out what the hold up was... No manager to be found, 3 sushi chefs standing on top of each other, and only one server for 8 tables,  (Jack! Thank you for hanging in there! You were great!)   I finally meet the manager and he only has a half ass apology and didn't even comp a single beer or appetizer after I clearly was not satisfied, (we were served the wrong roll, then didn't get something we ordered ) said he would do something for us, nope.  Poor service I would never want my business to be ran this way, what a shame.   Also, if you're employees are off the clock maybe take off the work shirts or not drink alcohol and distract the hostess."}
{"text":"Not sure you can find a better deal for lunch!  My wife and I dined at Ra for lunch three days in a row because it was very hard to beat the sushi quality and great value.    The staff are very kind and accommodating.  Definitely not the case at many restaurants on the strip.  The ambiance is nice, clean, and the music was outstanding.  Every day, I ordered the sashimi lunch for $12 dollars.  It comes with 12 big pieces of sashimi (salmon, hamachi, and maguro) and rice, a miso soup, and salad.  How can you beat that?  The sushi was fresh and well prepared.  I also tried some of their rolls.  They were great.  We capped the meal off with mochi.  Delicious.  I highly recommend Ra for lunch.  For dinner, you may want to hit one of the fancier sushi restaurants on the Strip.  However, for value, Ra is a homerun for lunch and likely for dinner too."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy eating here. Tonight was suppose to be a special celebration dinner for my brother. Was sitting inside for 20 minutes (already had been seated) with my family and not one waiter came to our table.. inexcusable service. Especially when the restaurant is dead. We left."}
{"text":"My old coworker was visiting in town for the holidays so a group of us girls decided to meet up for happy hour. We chose RA since it was pretty central to all sides of town and they had happy hour specials until 7 pm. The service was decent, no problems there and I liked that the happy hour wasn't restricted to just the bar area, but the food was just super average.  We ended up sharing some edamame, just salted and cooked the same way you could prepare it at home. I also had the seaweed salad and crispy calamari roll. Nothing stood out to me and it all just tasted like any other standard sushi restaurant.   It's a beautifully decorated place with a central locations and decent pricing, but don't expect to be blown away by their sushi."}
{"text":"I usually go to small family owned sushi places due to the quality. But i can always feel safe with ra sushi. No matter what location the service seems to be the same and the food tastes alike. If you don't know true and non cooperate sushi you probably will be satisfied with this. And their high prices don't help the situation. But I can't complain because every time I come in here I know what im going to get. So they can't be that bad?"}
{"text":"My buddy found glass in his noodle bowl glass.  As hit bit down and starting spitting glass out of his mouth we decided that this was are last visit here."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the look and the location of it but I've had better sushi such as sushi brokers up in Scottsdale. RA is good for a date but not for a great food experience"}
{"text":"Not the best sushi...but good.  I do enjoy going there for drinks and the crowd.  Great looking peeps, good music, good drinks, friendly service, good location, good sushi..Im a happy girl;)"}
{"text":"No RA RA RA cheer from me.  6 of us ordered at the same time.  5 got most of their food sporatically.  mine apparently was lost at sea.  one of our party ordered a 2nd dish and still got it before I got my 1st (ordered only an appetizer by the way) and one of us was still waiting for vegetables (both of us asked twice prior to the one guy placing his 2nd order).  after the 1st ask the waitress gave the traditional line of garbage \"it should be out shortly\"; no apology, no I am on the cook about it....  when I asked the 2nd time i got the \"let me check on it\"  when I had to ask a 3rd time I asked for a major discount. \"I'll text my manager\"  WHAT you have no one of upper customer service present on a Saturday night?  B.S.  after this I noticed the waitress come by with drink refills and come up from behind me and place the drink within 4 inches from my elbow while putting all other drinks in front of the person.   I find RA to be petty, putrid (stomach is still rumbling 10 hours later) and pathetic.  My friends' reaction to some of their food was not positive either.  Oh yeah, never got the discount for waiting over an hour for appetizer either!!"}
{"text":"It's really pretty inside, but the service and food were just okay.  The portions were tiny and it wasn't anything special, and it was expensive!  I suppose you pay more because it's kinda fancy inside, but still..  I ordered a bento box & there was barely any teriyaki chicken!  And it came with ONE gyoza & ONE egg roll.  My friends ordered sushi, and they didn't get their food until at least 15 minutes after I did.  They were kind and took one dish off the bill because of our long wait, but overall it wasn't the greatest dining experience.  My friends said the sushi was okay, but they've had better, and so have I."}
{"text":"Rock'n shrimp, one of the best items, lightly breaded & fried, lasvegas roll & pineapple wontons, yummmers! They have 2 happy hours per day, an earlier & one  later in evening. They have great unsweet tea that arrives in glass bottles..so good!! Super cute sushi spot if u r at the mall and hungry for sushi. Cute place but not the most extensive menu but still does the trick"}
{"text":"I came in with some friends and we order beer, the server asks us for id and my friend gives the server his Mexican ID and the manager denied it. We've been here before and servers and managers accepted the ID.We said that's bullshit and he tried to be a smartass with us about it which is disrespectful.  Never coming here again"}
{"text":"Great for happy hour!  Good quality was great, service ok.  We had no soy sauce and were not giving dipping side bowls to put it in."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since back in the day when they had dj's on Sunday nights.. long time. . Never left a review because I've been coming here so long. Long story short, this place is consistently Delicious! The staff is good but Sam the bartender is great! I'm a bar sitter and she is a bar sitters Dream . The garlic edamame is amazing and the seared ahi with their wasabi sauce (which you would never know had wasabi in it) is absolutely amazing. I miss The hamachi cama, if that's how it's spelled, but doesn't take away from their amazingness whatsoever . Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the happy hour sushi specials, but the roll selections were so-so, most of them were filled with cream cheese or mayonnaise. The nigiri sushi was better, but not the best I've had. It is a decent place for a quick bite though, just don't expect the most authentic or highest quality."}
{"text":"I love love love this place, awesome atmosphere. Great sushi. It's a little pricey but i think it's worth it for their beautiful sushi creations."}
{"text":"I'm still breaking in my sushi palate, but I'll still review the place as I see it. Happy hour specials make my addiction to their tempura shrimp a little easier on the wallet! Service can be a little slow and music a little loud, not just during peak hours either. Other than that, the food is delicious! So far I've only tasted the California roll.. Once I broaden my horizons, I'll update my review. Mmm..."}
{"text":"Zoo wee mama! This place has some #awesome sushi. Overall a good place and good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Best place to go to for sushi during Happy Hour!!!! Love the prices and service. Never disappointed by the sushi rolls. The Dragon Roll is my favorite."}
{"text":"This place is....well...ummm. My friends and I had reservations here for a bday dinner. EVERYONE else got seated before us. The girls at the front desk were rude and had no idea what they were doing. When we walked in gave the name... they just told us to wait one minute, so we did. 10 minutes pass by... so we go up and check on our reservation... we see at least 2 big tables empty while they're still taking their time...when I walked in (now probably 20 minutes) one of the girls said \"let me check on that for you,\" came back and told us to wait a few more minutes...while 'mind you' she seats other folks. Serious bullshit.   Anyway, after 40 minutes, they finally gave us our table...I did voice my opinion to the Manager, he was a nice guy so no disrespect sir, but train your staff!!! Maybe some customer service perhaps? Also, tell them to take their personal issues elsewhere and not to talk about their ex boyfriends or one night stands in front of their guests...that would be much appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place was on point. Prices are above average but the freshness of seafood makes it money well spent. We ordered maybe 5 different rolls... all delicious! The garlic edamame was a great starter too. I couldn't stop eating it."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere and service. Very friendly staff and I love the food.  They always have fresh sushi and excellent drinks. I plan on coming back again and again.  I enjoy the lobster Mango roll and the traditional California roll. Their potstickers are always wonderful."}
{"text":"All I can say is Viva Las Vegas roll! The only reason I come to this sushi spot!  It's like eating heaven. Soft, creamy, a bit a spice and a bit a sweet (not candy sweet, more tangy). For some reason the sushi rice inside this roll seems so much better than any other sushi rice in any other roll anywhere.  All I gotta say is it's a moat when you come here.   They usually have a great happy hour and even reverse happy hour with yummy drinks (alcoholic) that go well with any sushi roll.  Cool little atmosphere and nice outdoor patio area to enjoy the strip views."}
{"text":"Hub excellent sushi and service. try the viva las vegas sushi, can be mild or spicy, skip the chip to have it mild, eat the chip. for a spicy kick. the green tea ice cream is awesome.u"}
{"text":"UPDATE: i was forced to come back for a friends birthday. Though my last experience still has me bummed, i did have a more pleasant experience thus time. The waitress was excellent and the  manager Justice was one of the best managers i ever came into contact with. He was approachable, kind, and understanding. Makes me think maybe I can give this place another chance."}
{"text":"Nice decor and atmosphere. Hostesses and server (all female andI think students) were very nice and helpfull.  Server had some expression tattooed above her chest all the way across her body; I don't think this belongs in places where you relate to public professionally, but she was nice and I didn't walk out.  Had Philly roll, which was very good.  Seats at tables in bar room were very roomy and had pillows.  Roll and ice cream cookie I had before were filling.  I will go back if I get another server."}
{"text":"This is a review for their happy hour specials. Yesterday, I aimed to enjoy RA's lunch specials with my friend and if it weren't for him arriving 30 minutes past 3pm, I wouldn't have discovered their great deals.   We ordered the 'RA'ckin Rolls, Crunchy Calamari Roll, Viva Las Vegas Roll and the Pork Gyoza potstickers. Might I say, impeccable presentation and amazing taste! My friend also ordered the mango margarita and he lurved it! Guess I know what time I'm coming in for my next visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing place, only con is really crowd at the patio area because of construction going on, drinks and food fair price"}
{"text":"I ate at RA with my friends over the weekend it wasn't that memorable but wasn't that bad either.  I ordered a grilled apple teryaki salmon which arrived with wasabi mashed potatoes.  I was hoping for a great meal but it turned out to be a little too sweet for my tastes and not very good.  I did however get to try some shrimp tempura and squid tempura which was okay, nothing spectular either.  I ordered a \"viva-las vegas\" sushi roll which was okay, but nothing great as well.  Overall, the food at \"RA\" isn't that great and prices are average.  Expect to spend at least $10 on each roll and $15-$20 on their limited entree selections.   I still give RA three stars because of the overall vibe of the restaurant which was kind of cool and hip.  On the saturday night when we dined, there was a DJ spinning really cool music, music you'd hear at a Club or bar.  It was strange because I saw many families eating here and the music was a little inapproriate at times when there were 10 years old and F-bombs flying all round..haha!  Oh well, its Vegas right?    Alcoholic beverages were very good!  The zen mojito was really good as well as some geisha martini drink that I forget the name of.  Parking for this place sucks as you have to park in a structure for the mall it is adjacent to.  The walk through the mall can be bad so it maybe best to park at the Wynn and walk over Las Vegas Blvd. to get to RA... either way you have to walk a long distance but hey you get to check out things along the way.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"what a waste of time... service was the worse I have had in ages.. food was so so.. there are so many better places to go that care about the costumer.. will not go back..."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here on a Saturday for lunch; we were seated immediately and our waitress was very attentive. My husband isn't very experienced with sushi, and I'm not exactly an expert either, so she was great about going over the menu and trying to help my husband use the chopsticks (he managed to break the training ones).   My favorite was the Tunacado and my husband's favorite was the Las Vegas roll. We ordered the pineapple cream cheese wontons for an appetizer and they were good, but nothing to rave about, so I'm glad we got them for free with a coupon. My husband ordered Sake, but the waitress forgot about it (as did we) until the end of the meal, so she gave it to us on the house. I guess Sake is best when sipped throughout the meal, so that was kind of a waste, but at least it was free.  Overall, it was a fun and satisfying sushi experience."}
{"text":"We used to love eating here, but my husband and I think the service and standard has went way, way down. We went in the other night, got seated but quickly realized several servers kept walking right past us. We kept saying \"oh that must be our server... ok this girl must be our server, etc, etc.\" It started off comical, then it just became frustrating from a hungry, paying consumer standpoint. Each server would literally walk right past our table as if we were in visible. We hadn't been approached since we walked in, we ended up timing it; we sat there for twenty minutes. It was a huge bummer because I've spent a lot of money here, but we both sort of realized like \"WHY do we keep spending our money here?\" Every time we eat here or make an order to go, it continues to disappoint us from a customer service standpoint, and the quality/taste of the actual sushi. I'm not mad, just won't be eating at RA anymore. There's so many family owned sushi restaurants in the area that are SO much better."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  But for the fact that it is randomly in a mall, I think I may have given it 5 stars.  I went here with a group of girlfriends before seeing the 9:00 showing of Mystere at Treasure Island.  So it was a little on the late side, yet happy hour seemed to be going on and on.  Rolls were well priced and sake was $1 - big mistake for management given my friends' love for sake bombs.  Joe, our friendly hot waiter/kindred spirit fan of Eastbound and Down made fantastic suggestions on the food - though I can't remember the names of the rolls, I enjoyed one with shrimp tempura in it, some mango lobster creation, and another super hot one with jalapenos (I might have been the only one who thought it was super hot).  The atmosphere was pretty cool with lots of red lantern lighting and good music - though I felt like we might have been the only rowdy group there given the Sunday family crowd they had going.  But, delicious sushi, great cocktails, and wonderful service."}
{"text":"Trendy place but the sushi is only so-so. Kinda loud as well.  Overall a 3 out of 5 star experience."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA and decided to go here for lunch with three co-workers who spoke highly of the sushi.  They weren't lying.  The Ra-Rocking roll was very tasty as was the Salmon Nigiri and the other gods we ordered.  The service was great as was the cleanliness.  Highly recommended and if I come back to the Phx area will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Good food and great service! I had the mango martini, definitely has some kick to it! Teriyaki Salmon and Crunchy Shrimp Tempura roll we're great!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed with the service.  Our order took really long to get place.  We had to remind them about the orders. After we paid and waited 15 mins for our dessert, we end up leaving without it."}
{"text":"This RA was okay. Not my favorite location I have ever been to but the Sunday night happy hour is pretty bomb. Vegas rolls for $7. Rolls were good and service was normal"}
{"text":"Three words sum it up \"SMOKED SALMON NIGIRI\"  Crave this stuff in my sleep. Ruins the rest of the menu, yeah, nothing else compares. All the food is great but these take the cake, not even letting the other excellent dishes stand a chance...by a long shot."}
{"text":"Best sushi in Vegas. Its on my ToDo EVERY trip! The rolls and staff are always amazing!"}
{"text":"Normally I love Ra, I've always had good food and good service. Until now. The food was all disgusting and the service was horrible! We came at a time when it was not busy so it's not like our server was super busy with other customers. Probably won't be coming back now."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on a Saturday during the Tempe Arts and Crafts festival. The restaurant was extremely crowded, but we were seated immediately. Service was friendly and attentive, and the food was well-prepared, as it always is. Thanks to Ra for another, dependably enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! This place is pretty delicious! Great service, wonderful decor and good Sushi! I had the Shrimp Calamari Tempura Roll! It was delicious! Calamari, shrimp, cucumber, avocado, cream cheese and crunchy Tempura bits. The bits were even pink and green for Easter!!!! They may come in that color all the time, I forgot to ask, but I would like to say since I went there just before Easter they did the bits in those colors to be festive! It was awesome! I cant wait to go back and try more! PS - Try the spicy garlic edamame, gives normal edamame a little kick! Great starter! Keep it up RA! I may become a regular!!"}
{"text":"Where do I start. I don't rate very many places this low so that should tell you something. The only good thing about this place is the fact that there is a happy hour with half off specials. This included several sushi options, tempura, spring rolls etc.   But with the happy hour came a very young crowd. Apparently if you are in your early 20s in order for a place to be hip loud rap and techno music must be blasted through the speakers at a club-like volume. It was so loud the waitress had to lean into our table and get almost in our face in order to hear us and be heard. On that note, we left the venue with our ears ringing and our throats sore from trying to conduct a conversation over our meal.  Service was slow and our meals appeared at random throughout the the evening.Thus leaving some people waiting while others ate.   As for quality, the fish was fresh tasting. The spring rolls and tempura shrimp was nice and crunchy. But the rolls were very poorly made--probably just made quickly since it was very busy during happy hour. They fell apart as soon as you picked them up which should not happen.   The menu as a whole had many interesting options. But any sushi restaurant that has any real clout in my book would never have chips and salsa on their menu."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review...because...well, this is just disappointing. I've been a huge fan of RA for the past 5+ years. I just feel like the quality/quantity is decreasing and the prices are increasing. I understand it's a tough economy...but they just lost two loyal customers. This past time my husband and I went, he could have sworn the rice was different on the rolls (I couldn't really tell a difference but he didn't like it) and I know this is small to most people, but they don't have the low-sodium soy sauce anymore. We tried the regular soy sauce and just did a tiny bit, but it was so salty and overpowering, that we couldn't really enjoy our rolls. The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."}
{"text":"The service was great, but the food was just OK.  I can't say anything bad about the sushi...it was fresh and passable, but nothing special.  The hot dishes were disappointing.  There are better places to go in vegas, and I left pretty unsatisfied.  Not the worst place I've ever been, but not a place I'd visit again unless I had to."}
{"text":"I really recommend only coming here during happy hour.  That way you can eat enough to be full without going broke.  My favorites are the Mango Lobster Roll served with kiwi wasabi sauce ($9) and the Viva Las Vegas Roll ($12 or $6hh).  The service is pretty bad. I've had a couple bad experiences. The ambiance in general is sometimes pretty off too. Once when we went the restaurant was unusually warm and the air felt really stuffy and smelled kinda like a burp.  I have no idea what was going on but it almost made me sick. Very gross. Several other times the music is just too loud. I understand Thurs-Sat its more of a bar at night but when I go in on a Tuesday at 6:00pm its a little ridiculous that the hostess and I are screaming at each other yet still can't hear. She even acknowledged that the music was deafening but just kinda shrugged her shoulders about it. Overall this is a place I do return to every now and then even though I don't know why. The food is pretty good just don't expect anything service wise and maybe you'll be pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Too damn expensive and the service usually sucks! The food is good but not worth this much frustration."}
{"text":"Amazing! Sushi Chef Alex is wonderful!  Recommend to sit at sushi bar and watch his skill!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable outdoor patio. But the sushi itself is mediocre, with a slightly fishy (old) taste to it."}
{"text":"I have been going to RA for three years, I have had both really good and really bad experiences there, but I always come back because the food is AMAZING! Some of my personal favorites are the Viva las Vegas Roll, the Rackin shrimp appetizer, and the miso soup! Tonight I had Juan serve me and he was Superb, I wish every waiter there was as attentive as him!"}
{"text":"The service is good but sashimi is so so. Waited for a long time but the sashimi tasted very strange. Don't know the reason. I am the heavy fan of sashimi and almost ate all the best sushi restaurant around the world. So trust me I can tell the quality."}
{"text":"We came back to use the un-birthday coupon and it was well worth the trek to Old Town on a holiday. We tried some different items this time. The clam udon, the sashimi bowl called Krish-something and our usual Rainbow Roll. Everything was delicious and fresh. The clams weren't the best but you really can't expect the biggest and best while in AZ. I enjoyed some hot green tea this time which was lovely. My only complaint is the service was slow. It varies who is working it seems and where you sit. We usually sit at the bar at Happy Hour, this time we sat in the dining area. Overall it was a great experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is always one of the first places my husband and I go to, once we are in a city that has one. Having lived in Phoenix for around 10 years, this has always been one of my favorites. Recently they have added new rolls and sushi to their menu, and I must say, Great job!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend asked if I wanted to get lunch while I was at work, and so we decided to get sushi. I arrived before him, so I just had a seat at our table. I was a little disappointed no one offered me a drink while I waited, but whatever. He arrived not long after me, and we took a look at the menu. I decided to get the bento box with chicken teriyaki and he got a couple of rolls. The food didn't take long to come out, and I was surprised at how much food came with the bento box, definitely a filling meal. Our server was nice and attentive once we got the ball rolling with our orders, and we were in and out in under an hour. It was also nice that it wasn't packed during lunch time, which may or may not be a good thing. I'll probably be back, but not in any sort of rush."}
{"text":"I thought I'd reviewed this place before. Guess not.   First of all, Ra is loud as hell. If you want to go somewhere for a quiet, relaxing lunch or dinner, this is not the place. You will find yourself speaking loudly over the live music (which on Monday nights is very good by the way) or music they play over the system.   Second of all, I would only ever come here during Happy Hour. Partially because I'm not really a fan of sushi, and secondly because I don't like to pay a lot for things I'm not really a fan of. Tonight I spent $10 on chicken teriyaki, a california roll, and a tsunami punch. Great. It was good and I couldn't complain.   I am by no means a sushi expert, but a few of my friends that have tried a few different places seem to like it here.   The drinks are bomb. On my first visit I had the mango margarita. Tonight I had the baby tsunami punch and a taste of my friend's sake sangria. I can't vouch for how much alcohol is in them because they are so tasty, but for $4 I can't complain."}
{"text":"I don't think anyone really goes to RA for sushi. It's lovely that the food is delicious but if you are a local, all the Whoo-haw is about happy hour. I haven't visited since I was fresh out of High School and I went back a couple months ago. The morale has definitely been maintained.   Group visits are the best. You can have dinner with cocktails, eat too much and hit up the bar for a beer on your way out. It's sexy with all those red lanterns hanging about but hell, it's Vegas and that's to be expected.  It's centrally located in the Fashion Show Mall so you could make a day of it to avoid the heat.  Shop a bit, and take a cab back to your hotel for a nap with no trouble. Cab rides from there cost  $8 - $15 depending on how far South you are on Las Vegas Blvd. Any further North and you end up downing Royal Flushes at the penny slots in the Fitzgeralds. ( No!)   Location ....is the saying?"}
{"text":"My sister took me to this restaurant late at night and as soon as you step inside it has a cool vibe. Its dark with lots of lighting. Anyway the food was great. I loved the sushi. And the waiters were awesome."}
{"text":"Saturday 14th dinner @ 9:55pm, came here with a few friend to have dinner before we hit the town. There was 5 of us and we were ready to eat and spend $$$  Food:  what we had was the Lobster spring rolls!!!!!!! was so good that we ended up getting another one. Mango Martin was on point so big ups to the bartender for making that. RA Kckn Shrimp was so tasty! I wish we tried all the other food we got but after dealing 20 mins without food or not seeing our server and then dealing w our server after we asked for our food, we wanted to leave right away!  Our server Rob...... where do we start. Rob was the worst customer service i ever had in my life. he was so mad at something or someone that it look like he wanted to hit one of us at the table.  we asked him where is our food and he looks at us like were crazy. we asked him to read back our order to make sure we had it and instead of doing so he walked away and not once said Let me check or please hold on so then we asked for a manager. You can see the sweat come down from his bald head and the veins on his neck and his eyes were about to pop out from his face! The only reason why you can see all this is that he got all in my face and told us to fuck off!  Tony the manger can and told us Adam will be helping us out for the night. Told Tony n Adam everything and they was really sweet about everything and made sure we got everything we needed. so thank you 2 for making the night better. Adam knows we took card of him even after the bill got discounted thats not the point he got a fat cash tip from us.  if you look at the receipt we order a lot but did not want to eat it after that fact ROB went all crazy on us girls. we just wanted to leave.  Tony  or any other GM please talk to your server Rob and take look at the cameras to see how he got with his body and arms at us ladies at the table. who does that."}
{"text":"this place was amazing I'm a sushi lover and I love this place they make great quality sushi and they have great items and combinations on the menu the service was great the place is really nice and it's right on the strip very close to the mall they're green tea ice cream was on point thank you RA for an amazing sushi experience"}
{"text":"This place deserves zero stars, to be honest, but unfortunately that is not an option. I'm surprised that this particular location has stayed open as long as it has, considering that everyone I've spoken with has had negative experiences there. During my particularly negative experience, I initially complained to the server, however understanding that she could do little to resolve the issue for me, I asked her to get the manager who was TOO LAZY to drag his fat, useless ass out of his office to deal with an unhappy customer. Instead he just sent the poor girl back out to try and handle it on her own. Worst management ever, I don't know where they find these clowns, but if anyone from corporate is reading this, I'd strongly suggest that you fire all of your managers and start from scratch. I can see why the staff is unhappy, if that's the kind of management they have to deal with.   The food is mediocre, the prices are too high unless you happen to make it for happy hour, and the \"atmosphere\" is a joke."}
{"text":"Those of you who know me personally, know I'd call myself a Sushi Novice - I'm a beginner at best - despite RC & Hikaru's efforts to introduce me to the world of raw fish.  However, I too, sometimes get a craving for a good california roll.  LOL  Beginner that I am, I'm dragging my husband into this journey with me, and although I don't ever think he'll venture to try the Uni or the Eel, he too loves good tempura and mock - sushi.  We came across RA and decided to stop in.  We had a couple of Bento Boxes - AKA your basic combo meal (rice, salad, egg roll and tempura) in addition to a couple of Rolls.  Pretty good stuff.  Prices were ok, although I hear there is a MEAN happy hour.  We only saw our waitress twice - first to take our order and again to deliver the check - but the bus boy and the food runners took pretty good care of us.  We sat outside and could tell that the party of 9 to our left was taking up all our waitress' time, so she's forgiven.  Next time, I think I'll try the Rainbow roll....yum."}
{"text":"The short ribs and the king crab sushi dish were good. Everything else was way below par. The wings sucked, The tare tare was straight up DISGUSTING. Only  coming back here for short ribs and sushi..."}
{"text":"As good as it gets!  My hubby didn't really care for sushi until we went here. Everything is so fresh and yummy. The waiters were very knowledgeable as to what we wanted to order. This was one of my favorite memories and places while in Vegas. I cant wait to return."}
{"text":"Good happy hour deals! The dragon bite cocktail was really good - could've been stronger though. The spicy tuna roll was just ok though. Good atmosphere outside."}
{"text":"My first time here, my friend took me for a late night dinner on a Sunday night and the place was packed, but we still got a table right away. Our waitress was really nice and made sure she checked in on us often. Ordered a couple of rolls and decided to try every flavor of sake they had on the menu (at $1 each, why not?)....let's just say the rest of the night, i was feeling gooooood! =)  The next time I went to this place was for lunch with another friend, and we grubbed! Again we had another cool waitress that served us (she was pretty hot too....i forgot her name, but she had wavy hair and a nose ring...in case you're reading this ms. hot waitress...u rock!) The food was good and the fried tempura ice cream for dessert was yummy! I heard that this place is pretty popular with the locals, and they have industry nights complete with a DJ and happy hour specials. Gotta check that out next time! The whole vibe of the place is very hip and geared more for the young crowd. So I highly recommend this place if you're ever in Vegas, and don't wanna do the usual buffet routine...it's right outside the Fashion Show mall, off the strip. Perfect for a date or a big group of friends to hang out at for drinks and food."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Very very cute decor and ambience, and basically a good place to chill on a Sunday night!  Good thing about Vegas is that nothing ever really closes!!  =)    This might be the best sushi on the strip.  Sushi was very tasteful!  Try going during happy hour when prices are a lil cheaper!  Oh and the sake bombs are hellla gooood!  One bottle is actually good for 3-4 shots so share if beer is not your thing!"}
{"text":"I've never been disappointed with their food or their service. Like most good sushi places I can't seem to get out of there cheap. But I don't mind the cost if the food and service are good. I noticed that a lot of people ordered the vegas roll. The bar seems pretty busy at this place although we have never sat there. We just come for the sushi and drinks."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing, our server was great, and the ambiance was just incredible! The only reason I have to knock this restaurant review down to two stars was because of the terrible greeting we received first entering. After being glanced at and completely ignored for a few minutes I was the first to say anything asking if they had room for a party of two... obviously not having a reservation since I clearly said \"Do you have room?\" the girl proceeded in a nasty tone,\"Do you have a reservation.\" After telling her no she rolled her eyes and walked off leaving the server to accomodate us. It was extremely rude and a very bad first impression. It almost kept us from enjoying the awesome dinner we had!"}
{"text":"I've been to RA Sushi a few times and can vouch that you will always get a pretty good meal!  The restaurant has a bar at the front and in the back is the main seating area.  I have always been here during the busy dinner hour and can tell you that the restaurant is never that packed, yet the service is still pretty average.  In addition to our rolls we ordred the spring rolls and the pot stickers and both were excellent!  The biggest pain about this place is the parking by far (however this is the same with any place on Mill) you have to park on a lot near the restraunt, pay a buck or two and then walk.  The happy hour prices are about a dollar off the regular pricing so don't plan on going here just for happy hour.  (Sushi 101 is the place to go for a good happy hour!)   All in all, it's good food in an area I often find myself in.   Return factor 90%"}
{"text":"Ive been an Old town Scottsdale resident for 12 years, and never ate at Ra. Weird huh? So finally went in for happy hour. It was pretty slow in there. I tried a couple of their signature sushi rolls. And got our usual Rainbow roll. For some reason the rainbow roll was especially good. No clue what was different than anywhere else i go. So yes Im a fan of the food and atmosphere, the service not so much. Sooo slow or inattentive. I sat with ice in my (water) glass a few times. And when we were through with all our food still waited for the check to come."}
{"text":"Stopped here with Jessie B for a quick bite while shopping. We were seated right away but waiter was slow even tho place was pretty empty. We had pineapple cheese wontons...they come with the best dip. Its super fruity and sweet. Also had short ribs..tasty but TINY! But the wasabi  potatoes were nice that came with it. Seared tuna was perfect. And the Viva Las Vegas roll was melt in your mouth yummy!! So all and all a pretty good visit..and of course I will come back!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is a RIP OFF! $3.75 for domestic bottles!!???? $4.75 for a Corona?! OUCH!!!!!!!!  Other HH prices are barely a discount.  Horrid TV situation. (Only 3 in a bar that seats 50 and can only see one small TV per seat)"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. Personally we didn't try any of the food because we had eaten earlier. The servers were nice, but my best friend's husband complained that the drink he ordered was terrible (it was, we all took a sip; it tasted like cough syrup) but the server didn't really didnt seem surprised or remove the drink until my friend's husband gave it to her. Also through the process of serving all the sushi dishes they couldn't remember who had which ones, and which was which; there was a few minutes of confusion. We're not supposed to know which sushi is which, the servers are. There also was some inconsistencies with the wasabi. Some were so mild you could barely taste anything, while the others were so spicy that it brought tears to your eyes. No one made complaints on any of the sushi itself. However based on what I saw, I know I've had way better. We also took a look at the menu, and their prices are outrageous. I truly think RA is more of a trendy thing, like Starbucks...people just seem to go here because of the name. We'll just stick to our regular place for sushi."}
{"text":"The food is fresh & tasty! Bartender Caitlin makes happy hour AWESOME! The happy hour prices are among the best in Old Town. Great Sashimi, yellow tail, spicy tuna, pork dumplings, etc. I even had the seaweed salad and it rocked!  It's nice & cool, clean, and the place has a great vibe."}
{"text":"I recently went and found that they had so many gluten free options!!! Was able to indulge without getting sick form gluten! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Woohoo! I had a great time last night in this place. The sake bomb was awesome! The calamari fried and shrimp fried was delicious.  The uni sushi was little bit over soy sauce flavors for my taste.  The dynamite sushi was delicious, worth to try!  The service was awesome, and I would like to recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"Dear Ra  Your service completely sucks for lunch. If I go in when it is packed it takes me 1:20 + for lunch, if I go in when it is dead it takes me 1:20 + for lunch. The music is always blaring so loud I can barely hear my dining partners. This isn't a club, it is a restaurant at lunch time, set the vibe right... I really like the Salmon teriyaki bento box, but every time I order it the pot stickers are cold. Seriously EVERY TIME. Can you please make a few improvements?   I want to go back, you have a decent happy hour but fail miserably for lunch.  Sincerely, Sunny"}
{"text":"Great drinks they are consistent with their necks great food great flavor good customer service staff is very friendly and knowledgeable we seem to visit here once a month and enjoy the ambiance much nicer staff than the Mill Avenue location moderate to loud music which I like very cool place to hang out meet with friends family to start the evening"}
{"text":"Food was mediocre and service was terrible. Half our table got their meal after everyone else was finished eating."}
{"text":"We love the reverse happy hour.  There is a nice variety of food items and drink specials.  Additionally, the staff are all pleasant and accommodating."}
{"text":"I love this place and I love that they have happy hour from 3:00 - 7:00. My husband loves sushi, I do not. So this is the perfect place for the 2 of us. He can go to sushi heaven here and I can enjoy their other delicious options! I highly recommend the pineapple cheese wontons and the ra'king shrimp! The staff is also very friendly and the environment is great. You can either sit inside or outside!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great atmosphere, friendly staff, great food and excellent customer service. Have a DJ playing music on Friday and Saturdays, a bar and large tables that can handle a larger group for that much needed Happy Hour after work ;)"}
{"text":"Ate here with my girlfriends. The servers were very accommodating. The dynamite sushi was great because they had big pieces of scallops. The calamari were slightly bigger in size than what we anticipated which was great. The drinks weren't that spectacular unfortunately. But overall it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Great service, and wonderful food...beautiful presentation. It was a beautiful evening so we sat outside, nice ambiance except the planes that fly over every few mins. I'd probably sit inside next time. Overall good experience. I'd go back for sure!"}
{"text":"I hate that RA is the only sushi place on Mill. The bar is pretty good, and the happy hour drinks are decently priced. But the sushi quality is very low.  Be ready for loosely rolled rolls, funky smelling raw fish, and long wait times. I must say that in the past year or so, food quality has especially worsened--don't know if they switched suppliers or management or what.  During happy hour time, the bar is pretty fun but it is a very strangely shaped restaurant not conducive to large groups (unless you go wayyyy in the back) and the noise level is pretty high around the door. I would suggest Rula Bula happy hour over RA, or even Gordon Biersch.  Stay away if you love sushi."}
{"text":"Great food. Easy to get to.  Great service.  We walked in at 530 and sat a sushi bar with no wait.  Prices were reasonable.  We had the sashimi salad and it was wonderful and a really big portion."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here a lot and it is always great. They accommodate if you ask for little things like \"light cream cheese\" and such. The staff here is also absolutely great and We always enjoy coming here together with friends and on date nights and might I add the reverse happy hour amazing."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in Vegas and we wanted to try Ra Sushi.   Overall, the food was good. We enjoyed every roll we got and coming in during happy hour was a plus. I say it's a plus because the happy hour price seemed to be the reasonable price we should of paid for in the first place.   I took away two stars because our table and menus were sticky. Even after we told our server, she never did anything about it. We were a bit worried about our food, considering the condition of our table. However, we came out of Ra with no food borne illness. As for the service -- it was ok. Like I said, nothing was done about our sticky situation:/"}
{"text":"Came here with my cousin during EDC weekend for a late lunch/early dinner. We hit happy hour-- score!   I was starving so I may have went overboard ordering.  We shared (even though most dishes were mine) California Roll, Seared Tuna, RA'kin Shrimp, Viva Las Vegas Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Crunchy Calamari Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll.  Seared Tuna was excellent- nicely sliced and great melt-in-your-mouth texture. My cousin and I kept dipping blander rolls with this sauce...   RA'kin Shrimp was my favorite here! Panko-crusted HUGE pieces of juicy shrimp on a bed of greens with a tasty dipping sauce. If I ever come here for happy hour again, I'm gonna order 3 of these and be done with it!  Viva Las Vegas Roll had a thinly sliced and fried lotus root on each piece but the cream cheese was so overpowering. Why do we need cream cheese on everything? Ugh. This was alright, but I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese on my rolls to begin with...  Shrimp Tempura Roll... meh. Not crunchy at all. Soft and cold shrimp tempura with way too much rice. And it's not even good quality rice.  Crunchy Calamari Roll was alright. Kind of same as the shrimp tempura roll, but this time, you hardly taste calamari and only the cream cheese. Again with the cream cheese!   Spicy Salmon Roll was ok. Chopped up bits of salmon with a nice kick. The rice kind of ruined it, in my opinion.  Overall, great happy hour prices and my cousin and I loved the seared tuna and RA'kin Shrimp. This chain is more Americanized sushi, but on the strip, we can't complain too much.   At least we were beyond full and ready to party for EDC later that night!"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  Very convenient cause it's right beside the mall.  If you have transportation though, I'd suggest driving to Spring  Mountain and most of the sushi restaurants there will have pretty good sushi."}
{"text":"Great Happy hour!  Love th Miso Soup and the overall atmosphere!  Great plum wine too!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! We have been to the location in Vegas, and it was really good. But, we were really impressed with the service and quality of our food, our waiter was very helpful and talkative but not annoying at all! The bento box is divine and very diverse, (though we both got chicken and steak, and admittedly the chicken did taste better) and the sushi rolls were amazing; The spicy lobster pieces were massive and I got the crazy monkey roll per the recommendation of our waiter, AMAZING! and they both were plated and presented beautifully."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and the food and drinks were decent both taste and price wise. They had a monthly specials page which was great but the page stated \"April Specials\" and we are already at the end of May. Not sure how often they update the specials. The April specials were delicisous either way. Service was a little slow and for some reason after we arrived they turned down the lights and turned up the music. I saw a bunch of tables using their cell phones to as makeshift flashlights so that they can view the menu. Other than that I wouldn't mind coming back for happy hour again."}
{"text":"My husband and I visited Ra for happy hour. Upon looking at their happy hour menu, I thought it looked great. Lots of food and drink variety for decent prices.   The blushing geisha cocktail was delicious and my husband enjoyed his Kirin. Unfortunately, the whole eating experience was underwhelming.   The Pacific Roll has potential. It tastes great, but it was very loosely rolled. Every bite fell apart either before we dipped it into the soy or in mid-dip. We had a lot of soy splashes on our table.   The asparagus salmon and spicy shrimp were both as bland as could be and chock full of minced stuff. Save the minced fish for off-brand fish sticks, people, please. We also ordered the seared tuna and the citrus yellowtail tapas. Both were just thin cut fillets of rawish fish with some foliage and sauce drizzle thrown on top. Meh.  Lastly, we sat on the patio, which is a back patio. It faces an alleyway rather than Mill Ave. And while it has a nice outdoor bar, it was chock full of smokers.  I'm a non-smoker so I'm biased on this point, yes, but who smokes while eating sushi? Also, there is no air circulation back there. Just patio and alleyway, so all the smoke just hangs.  I will give props to our server. She was prompt, polite, and delivered our order speedily. The speedy part was great because with all that smoke, we were dying to get out of there."}
{"text":"I've been to Ra many times but finally decided to write a review. They consistently have one of the best happy hours in Vegas! I highly recommend the Viva Las Vegas roll, the crispy rice with spicy tuna, and the garlic yellowtail sashimi. So bomb! The salmon carpaccio is ok.  Here's a hint: check in on Foursquare and get a free miso soup or order of edamame!  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"So I just had my half birthday at RA (something that they celebrate, where you get a free $20 on your half birthday every year) and it was a good time. I got there at the perfect time as it was reverse happy hour so things were pretty cheap. $20 to spend and I did not know what to get :)  I got one rainbow roll (my favorite roll), one California roll (the go to roll), and miso soup... oh and water... I did also manage to squeeze in the RA'ckin shrimp because it was on the happy hour menu and I was intrigued by it. Plus I was trying to get that $20 worth lol  So the reason I gave them 3 stars was because service was a bit slow. It just seemed a bit unorganized as the servers kept coming out with a puzzled look as to where the food was going. I did like our server though, she was a sweetheart and Im always nice to servers :) My food did take time to reach me though and I was a little shocked because it being a Tuesday night.   I did have a margarita though and it was yummy! Kudos to the bartender :)  Okay so my food made its way out My miso came out mega hot and I downed it I love Rainbow rolls so I scarfed that bad boy down in less than 3 minutes The RA'ckin shrimp took a while but it gave me time to drink and hang out in the cool MIll ave atmosphere  I used to be such a mill rat that it was nice to see everyone there enjoying their reverse happy hour time :)  Anywho, my shrimp came out and I was surprised The display was nice and it was actually really good Might be one of my fave new dishes at RA You should try it if you already havent  RA'ckin Shrimp  Its yumzo  All in all my half birthday was nice and I will always go to RA on mill just because I love it. Our server was darling. The food was good and the music made me want to stroll down to Cue Club or across to Vintage!"}
{"text":"RA is ok.... I like to go to HH but if u don't get there early, it starts to get real loud. The food is usually great, the crunchy calamari roll is my favorite. I also usually get the Gyoza, Tootsy Maki, & Scallop Dynamite roll.  Prices are decent during HH... Last time I went the booth smelled weird :("}
{"text":"Favorite spot to go for sushi and drinks hands down;the whole staff never fails to give us exceptional service every single time. And special thanks to TJ, for converting my boyfriend and I to regular customers."}
{"text":"Just recently got into sushi so still learning... Their Las Vegas roll was amazing! So good! I even got the chicken just in case... Didn't need it they did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was surprised when I pulled RA up to review and saw it's overall poor rating. After reading through some of them, I think I understand.  This is NOT a good family dining place. It is loud, and most of the patrons are animated and having a good time. Feels more like a bar, which I'd like to point out is in it's name.  This IS a great place for a group of friends or a couple. My mother and I sat at the bar where we had great service. As we were ordering sushi to split, we were quite pleased that they brought our dishes out as they were ready - one was even made by the chef right in front of us (the other two were prepared in the kitchen.) If you're a large group and nobody plans on sharing sushi, I can see how this would be a problem.   I grew up on the CA coast where fish is always expected to be fresh, and I was very impressed by the quality of their seafood. All the fish I watched being prepared looked amazing.  Is it super traditional? No, of course not, it's not a little Japanese restaurant, it's a trendy spot in downtown Scottsdale. I'm a huge fan of Tex Wasabi, Guy Fieri's fusion sushi place in my hometown, and until RA, had not found another sushi place with a more modern take. Their \"Hot Mess\" is a must try. Can also vouch for \"RA\"kin' Roll and the \"Tootsy Maki.\""}
{"text":"Rude manager. Roger our server  asked the manager If it was alright to order a combination sushi platter /box that is only offered during lunch, but the customer wanted it at 8pm because of the variety. The manager standing in front of us just ignored the guests and barely wanted to answer the server, and just walked off shaking his head. Completely RUDE! What kind of manager doesn't even greet the guest, especially when they are right there in front of him making a special request. Definitely not an A team manager. Don't bring your personal issues and attitude and let the guests feel it. You are the manager, act professional. You are suppose to be a leader, and if you being a leader is like that, you can guest what that says about the rest of the staff. They gotta be jerks and rude like you to ensure they keep up w what and how you represent the Brand. Roger was great though. He has a fun positive demeanor."}
{"text":"We live down the road from Ra, so we were excited to have sushi place close in the neighborhood. We were a little turned off by the low reviews, but we decided to go anyway. Bad decision.  The avocado on our rainbow roll was literally brown! We got avocado in another dish, and it was also brown.   The service was also extremely poor. It took a long time before anyone noticed us, and I finally had to flag down a server to get water. The food came out in a weird order (they forgot my miso soup and served it after the main dish), and they served my wife five minutes after serving me.   We will not be going to Ra again, here or anywhere. It was a comically bad night of service!"}
{"text":"Food was good but by far the best I've had. Portions small during happy hour so not much of a bargain. Service was very poor. It's an ok spot overall."}
{"text":"You always remember your first....  OK it wasn't the first time I had sushi...think the first time was on Scottsdale road but I had drank too much didn't really remember how it tastes.  This was the first time I was properly introduced to sushi and like all firsts it isn't the best in the world but will always have a soft spot.  for extra points try drinking sake with chop sticks!"}
{"text":"I came here a while ago, so I can't remember exactly what I ordered but we came for happy hour. They had LOTS of choices for happy hour alone and the restaurant is very spacious. The service here is only eh but it's definitely a great place for happy hour. My sister and I came here and ordered 3-4 rolls and a seaweed salad, and it was only $25! For sushi!   Whoever comes here, must must MUST get the Viva Las Vegas Roll. It's a little americanized but holy moly it is tasty!"}
{"text":"Met my dear friend, Hyla for lunch over the weekend. Just in time for sushi happy hour. We sat at the bar, the atmosphere was as expected for a 'Labor Day' Monday. Jerry, our server was polite and attentive. The food was excellent, especially the VIVA LAS VEGAS ROLL! I would definitely recommend RA on Mill Ave to those who seek all of the above!! *****"}
{"text":"The food here is actually really good, but it is by a landslide the best service I have ever received at a restaurant! Our waiter Patrick literally made our night! Explained every dish in explicit detail and was right on point with everything. If you're luck enough to have him as your server don't even bother ordering just tell him to bring you what he thinks is best and you won't regret it! When they say \" be the best at everything you do\" they're talking about Patrick! Oh man and happy hour all night long! Good service, good quality sushi, and a hell of happy hour!   Thanks again for the good food and time!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in town for Family Week visiting my kid sister at ASU. We came here for dinner before we all headed home. Dinner was great, portions were huge, and no one complained about anything they ordered. We sat for quite a while enjoying the last few hours of our trip. We ordered, various sashimi, the dragon roll, rainbow roll, beef teriyaki and a tootsie roll.    Only thing was that the bathroom is shared with the smoke shop next door, so being that we sat at one of the rear tables, every time that door opened and shut, the strong smell of incense comes in and out of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Happy hour = tons of food for little money.  My favorites:  -Edamame -Tootsy Maki -Viva Las Vegas Roll -Crispy Spicy Tuna -Pineapple Cheese Wontons  Fun atmosphere too!  Sometimes a bit loud though."}
{"text":"My friend and I went here for dinner not realizing it was also happy hour.  We decided on the happy hour menu.  I always forget when it's happy hour, and I order a roll, the roll is more rice than usual and smaller portions of fish--the same held true here.  But that was my fault.  The rainbow roll was $8.99, so why not spend a little more and get the non-happy hour rainbow roll with less rice and bigger pieces of fish?  Next time I will.  All in all, the sushi was good as was the tuna tataki (also at the happy hour price).  That was a meal in itself!  I had ordered seaweed salad, but cancelled that when I saw the tuna tataki.  So much food!  Service was excellent--we had Nikki and she acted like she really wanted to be there and that she loved working there.  How refreshing!  I also completed their web survey, so we have a $10 credit when we go back (good for 30 days from our visit).  Love it!"}
{"text":"This review would have been 5 stars if the restaurant had paid more attention to their reservations. My Husband had made a reservation days prior, for our anniversary, and noted he wanted some type of \"intimate\" table setting if possible. Seating us in the middle of the dining area rather than at a booth, when there were only 3 tables inside the whole place was just extremely rude and unfair given he was provided the option to note something in the reservation request. Now to note, we had never eaten at this location before but had eaten at their Chicago location roughly 3 years ago and enjoyed it so much! We were anxious to give this location a try and I'm glad we did. The happy hour is one of the best for sushi but not the greatest for drinks. They don't have flavored warm saki but have strange flavors you can add to yours. Our favorite roll that we remembered from Chicago is the Vegas roll and they reminded us why it is our favorite once again. We have never found a roll quite like it but love it!  Unfortunately one of the rolls we ordered had mashed up avocado that clearly was a little aged as I had an allergic reaction and was unable to eat after that but my Husband enjoyed many other rolls. Also, read a review to try the pineapple wontons and they were SOOO worth it!!! Try them!!"}
{"text":"thought the sushi rolls were pretty mediocore.  though if you're there on a weekday, you really can't beat their happy hour specials.  there's also sometimes a dj, which helps keep the place lively."}
{"text":"I like their food & drinks and they have some good deals. I've never had good luck with the service at this location though. I had a big birthday dinner here a couple years ago and they insisted that doing call-ahead seating would ensure that our party of 15 wouldn't have to wait. This sounded too good to be true for call ahead seating so I called back and talked to someone else who also insisted that doing call-ahead seating would ensure that our party of 15 wouldn't have to wait. We did call-ahead seating, we got there, we waited for an hour, and we finally split up and sat at opposite corners of the restaurant for dinner. If they hadn't been so insistent that everything would work out great and that we could sit together and wouldn't have to wait, we definitely would have gone someplace that takes reservations! RA in Scottsdale is only good for groups if you & your friends are up for doing sake bombs in the bar for 2 hours while you wait for your table. ;)"}
{"text":"Came here for the second time Sat Nov 15.  Our hostess Jessica was super sweet and gave us several options where we could sit.  Our waitress was (I believe) named Megan (shorter, and cute short blond hair) and she was super super sweet, giggly and a great waitress.  We started with the edamame, which was just normal edamame.  We also got a spicy tuna roll for a starter and it was tasty.  For my entree I got the Tuna2 salad which was pretty tasty.  Sooo much raw fish on it, but the ra fish could have been seasoned or something to add a bit more taste.  It was good though.  One friend got the Ultimate Shrimp tempura roll and said it was fine..just decent, and my other friend got the.....i cant find it on the website, but it was a steak roll served with some type of sauce.  We ended up ordering a 2nd roll of that because it was pretty tasty..the meat was a little over cooked, but good with the sauce.  The service was great and the atmosphere is fun..and the heating lamps on the patio are great :)  To end our dinner my friend ordered the espresso martini and it was sweet but super good and super strong!  All of their drink's looked delicious!"}
{"text":"I virally enjoy going to RA, but I must admit I was disappointed in this particular RA. Service was slow, friendly but slow.  Food was good, definitely not a place to go off happy hour, we didn't realize it until we got our bill. I will stick to my regular RA and definitely at happy hour!"}
{"text":"When I'm in Vegas, I love to hit up RA. I do admit that their food is only mediocre but the prices are right. And for Vegas, I'll take it! They have good deals on both food and drinks. Half off appetizers and select sushi and rolls. I usually stick to their appetizers because their sushi isn't all that great. The Viva Las Vegas Roll is good but everything else is very forgettable. Sake for $2 and well drinks are $4.   Grilled short ribs are great! I always want to get two orders when I go because their filling and for about $3, I'm very satisfied. Their shrimp tempura can sometimes be limp, but I don't mind too much.   Happy hour is from 3-7 and if you're really curious about their menu check out their website."}
{"text":"Best Happy hour 3-7 Mon-Sat and get the 22oz Kirin and small sake for $7.75. Salmon carpaccio was nice and Vegas roll. Can't go wrong with the tuna Tataki and rainbow roll for $7.75 each during HH."}
{"text":"Have you tried their happy hour?  You should.  I can't believe i like fish in the middle of the desert, don't tell my friends back at home in the bay area.  The tempura calamari is wonderful, please try.  Gyoza is good.  Sushi has plenty of the good stuff - wasabi, makes you feel alive.    Love the music.  Gets kind of loud, so if you're looking for an intimate spot, this is not it.  Good place for a celebration with lots of people though.  Very friendly service."}
{"text":"note: this review is about the two times i've been in the last week. RA use to be a regular spot for me when i lived in LA. i use to work @ lazy dog cafe and we'd all go after our shift. happy hours are awesome!!!!  visit #1: my boyfriends parents were in town for his graduation. they were staying a TI and were looking for somewhere close to grab lunch. we figured RA would be a great place to check out and they have pretty awesome lunch specials. we sat in the dining room and our server was awesome! i cant say that for the host, exactly, but our server was definitely amazing! (the bf's family is from hawaii and so is she, so they bonded fairly quickly). everyone ordered a bento, except for me (i ordered the bara chirashi bowl and his dad ordered the viva las vegas roll). food was delicious! the bowl was SO filling! hamachi, salmon and tuna sashimi, rice and avocado. i barely finished it! it was a perfect lunch - simple and satisfying.  visit #2: his parents had us watch their suite while they were away, and we wanted to go somewhere we could walk to. so - RA happy hour it is! we ordered a tsunami punch (fish bowl was $13 and the baby tsunami punch was $6. we were gonna get 2 anyway, so we opted for the regular price fish bowl). we also ordered short ribs, wings, salmon carpaccio, edamame and seaweed salad. bill was about $40. our server at the bar was awesome as well (tracy). we needed a few boxes and still have quite a bit of our fishbowl left. i think she noticed we were full and the itis was about to kick in, and since its on the strip you're able to take your drink with you in a to-go cup (i had no idea that was possible! im so use to places saying no!). we left there full and completely satisfied.  thanks RA sushi!!!  definitely check out happy hour! quite a bit of tapas and rolls available on the menu, and some pretty awesome drink specials too! (pictures to come soon! and - i think i creeped out the guy who was sitting next to me. it was kinda dark in there, so every time i took a picture of my food, the bright flash from my blackberry went off. after we got our food, he switched to seat on the other side of the bar)."}
{"text":"Good sushi.loved the lobster mango roll. They need a happy hour special. Huge menu if you're not into sushi. Don't get the tacos the shells are awful. Great ocean salad"}
{"text":"I think this place is okay.  In a town of super pricey sushi- it is reasonable...but you pay for that in quality.  The dishes can be interesting and I was impressed by the diverse staff.  The service was quick and friendly.  But not the most impressive sushi I have ever had.  The rice was a little too wet, the fish the all you can eat quality...But I understand they have a spot in Torance CA...so maybe that location is different."}
{"text":"Whether it is true or not, eating at Ra reinforces my self-concept that ... I ... am ... COOL.  Naturally, there is a fifteen minute wait.  Cool people have to wait to be cool.  We sat at a table in the bar area and just had our meal there as you can order off the full menu and don't have to wait for your buzzer to go off.  Cool people don't have to wait the full amount of the wait time.  Happy hour lasts till 7 and offers an array of sushi and non-sushi items.  Cool people eat sushi.  I ordered the salmon and spicy shrimp nigiri and the pork gyoza just for me.  My wife ordered some vegetarian items and unfiltered sake for us.  Cool people get it unfiltered.  My items came quickly.  The vegetarian items did not.  When I inquired about this, we received an apology and two of the vegetarian items for free.  How cool is that?  Very!!  All the food was great, and the desserts are especially creative."}
{"text":"Great food.  Very nice atmosphere. Music a bit loud but the food was worth it.  Great happy hour prices."}
{"text":"Meh.... we stopped here after arriving here at 11pm and just stopped here because it was the first place we saw that was open.  This place is definitely trying too hard for the cool and hip clubbing sushi place and it definitely had the loudest music of any place I've been to in that genre.    But anyways, the food was decent, and it satisfied the Lady's uni craving.  Geez I need to find a source for those uni blocks...."}
{"text":"I've had diarrhea the day after both times I've eaten here. The sushi was decent, but not outstanding, and I thought the price was a bit high for kinda weak rolls. But I am starved for sushi in Tempe and maybe I'd go back. Well probably not actually. I'll look for another place."}
{"text":"Wow...Happy Hour (half price rolls and $1 sake) Mon to Sat and it is on the strip! I was shocked! The music is pumpin and it is lit up all red inside. The Las Vegas Roll was to die for! I will be sure to stop back here on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Definitely come during happy hour or this place can be very pricy. I went with some friends to catch up for dinner. I ordered everything off the happy hour menu.  I had the edamame which were a little salty.  Next time I get them Ill probably tell them to salt it less.  I also had the Tuna Tataki. It was thinly sliced tune in this sauce with a little salad in the middles. I really liked it.  I also had the Crispy Spicy Tuna Roll.  This was nothing what I thought it would be.  It was spicy tuna on top of a crispy rice ball.  It was very good though.  I also had the Dengaku tofu.  You have to try and eat these first because they come crispy and if you let it sit they will be soggy.  The sauce they are sitting in is pretty good but the other sauce that is on top is odd. I didn't really like it.  I really enjoyed this place and glad I came during happy hour.  I would not come when it isn't happy hour.  It would be too expensive."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch & had a bad experience. The food here is just ok. The service is horrible. They don't have enough staff obviously. My salmon isn't fresh. The shrimp is over cooked. First & last time for me."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it we will probably try it again. We sat outside at the rail overlooking the strip. Our waiter was attentive and offered a lot of suggestions.  The rolls seemed salty and when ever it called for crab it was mixed with mayonnaise which was disappointing.  My advice is to stick with happy hour rolls and drinks"}
{"text":"The kitchen was in the weeds tonight, and the server was entirely unapologetic. Sushi came out sporadically, and we had to ask twice for ginger and wasabi. I'm sure the place is good on a slow night but they clearly weren't ready for tonight."}
{"text":"Food is good, isn't an issue. But service is. I gave two stars because the service was horrible. Our server was disconnected & cold. They hardly asked how we were doing & it felt like we had to catch their attention  to order or ask a question.  Sushi is about having a good time."}
{"text":"The service was horrible and when we brought it to the attention of the manager his excuse was \"we are short staffed.\" Which is a generic response and there was only 4 tables seated in the lounge area, not to mention he didn't do anything to compensate us for only seeing our server once the entire time we were there. And if they were truly short staffed, he should have been out on the floor helping, which is wasn't."}
{"text":"Average sushi joint. Not bad. Prices are definitely on the affordable side. Only thing was that server took a while to take our order. Chicken yakitori was okay, there was a lot of black pepper. Otherwise I just settled for a California roll and it was good because it was just not imitation crab which was a plus! I'd come back if I was looking for something simple and didn't want to pay much for food. RA is right by my hotel so it is a short walk, perfect for my sore feet."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by our late night happy hour.  It's conveniently located across from the Wynn Hotel at the Fashion Show Mall.  Our server was great and the items we ordered were pretty good considering it was sushi on the strip.  Happy hour prices were reasonable.  There's a RA restaurant at the Del Amo Mall in Torrance which I walked by frequently, but never dined at.  Ironic that I discovered it in Vegas."}
{"text":"RA Sushi -- well it is what it is.  I think this location is the best out of all the RA Sushi around the valley.  It's spacious and has a nice patio.  Again, I'm not a big fan of their Sushi, but their happy hour is decent.  I really like their bar setup...you can actually watch the game anywhere to sit! :)"}
{"text":"Kiddo and I enjoy visiting this Ra.  Service is spotty but the Happy Hour specials decently prices (but smaller portioned) and give a good variety - good for a mama/daughter date."}
{"text":"I want to hate Ra because, well, it's Ra. But the truth is, every time I come here I leave happy and satisfied.   Being a Veggie, sushi is really hit-or-miss but I always seem to get pretty lucky here. Tonight was no exception. Everything was really full of flavor and really fresh. You are probably thinking that it is hard to mess up veggies, but I have had some bad sushi before (Stingray!!!!!!)   I was stoked when I asked the waitress to recommend a Chard (they had four) and she actually made a suggestion. I was really happy with it and was even more delighted that she pointed out something on the happy hour menu.   I really like the atmosphere. I have a thing for balls. I mean red orbs. Only complaint is that the music is normally wayyyyy too loud. The service is always really good, so they balance one another out.  Oh...we also tried the Cinnamon tempura ice cream with raspberry drizzle. OH MY FREAKING GOD. It was... absolutely orgasmic! YUM!  Now if they could only fix the parking issue..."}
{"text":"I come to RA Sushi quite often because it is so close to the house and if you want something quick it is perfect! We always sit in Heather's section because she is so attentive! She is also great at recommending new things for us to try and knows the menu very well. My favorite item on the menu was the Hot Ra'k, so sad it is no longer on the menu but Heather recommended the salmon and it was incredible! No matter how packed it is we always get great service in the bar area. This will always be a favorite spot of ours!"}
{"text":"What's worse than having boy wait on you at Ra? Having a boy wait on you at Ra that doesn't know a thing about Sports when the NFL draft is on and the NHL playoffs.  He service was stellar, and that is usually a stretch for RA Tempe."}
{"text":"Great happy hour!!  Made a point to stop by here on our 4 night trip last weekend.  Our other friend had heard about it too so we all went in a big group.  The guys loved the sake bombs and all the appetizers & rolls were yummy.  Good spot for good food & yummy drinks for a good price.  Would definitely go back there again on our next trip."}
{"text":"happy hour food and drink specials are worth visiting this place.  it gets pretty packed and claustrophobic inside so i usually choose to sit outside.  try different rolls everytime you come here. two people can eat and drink well for $50-60 including tip during happy hour here!"}
{"text":"I tried like 5 different appetizers, and four rolls. Nothing really worth mentioning. Appetizers are pretty cheap for the happy hour price, but I probably won't go back. If you tried the rolls, you would know this place is not authentic Japanese. The reason that I gave them a three star was because their drinks are good and decent price for happy hour. I still love yard house the most for happy hour."}
{"text":"Friend and I were shopping at Fashion Show and were looking for a place to grab some food.  We stumbled into RA and realized it was happy hour (3-7pm).  Prices for drinks (sake, beer, well drinks) and appetizers are probably one of the best deals in town.  And the staff was friendly and very accommodating of my tiny tot and big fat stroller.  No snootiness here.  It was a pleasant surprise.  Wish I could say the same for the food.  The rolls are puny and poorly made.  The scallop dynamite was more onions than anything else.  Lobster spring roll had too much cream cheese and not enough anything else.  Despite all my complaints about the food, would I go back?  Possibly.  It's convenient and prices aren't bad..."}
{"text":"The happy hour prices make it affordable but the food quality still doesn't match the price.  I've had a fresher tasting roll at AJ's grocery store.  My colleagues and I went here for an early dinner (they eat here a lot) and even they said it was not as good as before.  The tuna for the hot & spicy tuna roll and the \"lollipop\" was so over diced that it was actually mushy.  When we brought this to the attention of our server he just made a scowl said sorry and took the still full of food plate.  No discount, no formal manager apology, nothing but the bill dropped off as he dashed on by."}
{"text":"You are most definitely allowed to have a dog in a restaurant if it's a service animal. By law, you are not allowed to ask me anything other than if she's a service animal. Doesn't have to wear a vest. Check the ADA laws before you offend someone.   Probably should also make sure the hostess doesn't give people a look like we're crazy. It's offensive and there are plenty of other sushi options in Old Town that won't be so judgemental.   I haven't eaten gotten my food and I'm turned off to this place right now."}
{"text":"Great food, great happy hour, fantastic bartenders. Hayden was humorous & kept the drinks flowing! Thank you"}
{"text":"Good sushi, great service. The loud rock music and night club atmosphere was a little too much. Went on a Thursday night and was told it was really laid back. I'd avoid the place on the weekends if you are looking for a quiet relaxing dinner.   The sushi was just okay.  For the price you pay, I'd expect excellent.   A little disappointed."}
{"text":"This place went downhill. service and food wise. seems like they just don't care and their happy hour isn't as good as it used to be. many items no longer available and not much of a discount. Sorry but too many other options to choose from in the area. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Happy hour prices here are lame. You save a whole .25 on some items. Not the deal it used to be. Others are $1.00 off. Whoa!!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I were just in for sushi.  We were greeted in the most lovely way and directed to sushi bar  The manager, Sean came over immediately and welcomed us. Our waitress was fabulous as was all of the food.  I highly recommend this wonderful restaurant.  More than we expected and I will certainly return.  Thank you for a delicious meal."}
{"text":"I haven't come to Ra sushi in many years.  I didn't realize they have an amazing happy hour every single day from 3pm-7pm.  We met up with some friends here this last Saturday for Happy Hour and got a table outside.  It was so nice and perfect.  The service was a little spotty and our server seemed a bit annoyed with us, I guess considering we are loud and order a lot of food and drinks constantly.  We ordered a variety of items off of the menu, and all of it was really good.  I orderd a couple of pieces of salmon nigiri and the fish tasted fresh.  We also kept the drinks coming.  $5 cold sake bottles!  My goodness, I got in trouble quick!    It's a great little spot to do happy hour with friends and people watch.  If you're not in a big rush, because service can be slow, then it's definitely a fun place."}
{"text":"The food is pretty cheap for lunch, but the quality reflects the price. I had pineapple chicken, which was mediocre. The fried noodle was not real noodles, so I asked for some rice instead and that cost almost $3. Getting hot tea also costs extra here, and it tasted like instant tea. I'd recommend just sticking with water."}
{"text":"We came on a Saturday for happy hour and got the edamame, spicy salmon roll and shrimp tempura roll. Great taste, price, cool vibe!!!  The coconut Creme Brulee was a highlight!!  Off-the-chain!!  We will return!!"}
{"text":"Went in on a Thursday night. I ordered come rolls and they were very good, fresh, but on the tiny side for the price. I sat at the sushi bar and the chef was super nice and very attentive. The waitress I had was nice, but brutally slow. Maybe it was because she had too many tables, I didn't notice. I don't have a whole lot of patience when I am sitting alone.  The music was fun. When you hear Ice Cube's Today Was A Good Day, it's pretty awesome. The volume wasn't too loud either. Would I go back? Yes, but only if someone else is paying. I wish they carried Hana flavored sake. Fuji Apple...omg yum"}
{"text":"This is the only sushi place in TEMPE that has been willing to accomodate a glutn free diet. I order rainbow rolls, no rice, no mayo. Perfectly done everytime, no questions asked! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Went to RA with some friends Monday night. The host didn't seat us...as in we followed her to the back (after she told us to) and she disappeared behind a curtain...and (like I said) didn't seat us, we awkwardly stood by the sushi bar looking at eachother, unsure of what to do. Then, what looked like a manager, came out and said they would put two tables together for us. Awkwardly he left, awkwardly the host left, awkwardly another dude came out and put the tables together, awkwardly we got sat.   The server wasn't terrible, he was very nice and attentive. He made a lot of jokes and tried to make our experience better. Though he did forget to bring out a soup, and got a bit discombobulated with the checks. But he was definitely the highlight of our experience.   Overall the experience wasn't great, but I have had awesome experiences there before with great hostesses and servers. We felt pretty ignored and uncomfortable during our dinner Monday night."}
{"text":"When we went to RA it was a Sunday night and this place was hoppin at 9:30.  We couldn't believe it.  The drink and food specials were amazing.  We ordered Saketinis, a spiked lemonade and a Tsunami Punch.  We ended up ordering a crispy spicy tuna roll, one like no other, and sitting back to watch the people.  RA was amazing.  The drinks were good and sushi as good if not better.  Anytime we return to Scottsdale, RA is going to be a must stop!"}
{"text":"This place has great service most of the time. Every now and again you get the one server who is just terrible.   Last time I went Alice Cooper was sitting in the table next to me. That was cool. \"We are not worthy, we are not worthy....\"  Happy Hour is the ONLY time to go. Things are moderately priced then. Including the $500 Coronas. Its hit and miss whether or not the server will let you continue to get happy hour prices after happy hour. Usually, it is a  miss."}
{"text":"Ra is very easy sushi for the uninitiated. It's fairly reliable and tasty. It's not the best sushi in the world, but c'mon - this is Arizona. Sushi snobs/connoisseurs won't think much of this place.   The place is nice inside and the waitstaff is comprised of young and beautiful girls. The bar is a bit of a hot spot and the restaurant in general manages to stay busy most of the time. It seems to have a lot of 20-30somethings at the bar and high school girls in the main room. The older guys in the bar area look like they just got off work with the top buttons of their collared shirts undone, but their tans and physique suggest they put that look together.   The high school girls look like they took fashion and makeup tips from Paris Hilton and then doubled it... overdone and looking like they belong on some Mtv reality show. Think: modernized 80s Madonna. I imagine them going back to school the next day and bragging to their classmates how they went and had sushi at Ra thinking they are so adult. I wanted to choke those bitches out when I was in High School - nice to see nothing ever changes.  It's a good place to take someone who hasn't ever really tried sushi before or people who are scared of sushi. I like to eat here because it's close and simple. I haven't really had a bad experience yet. Sushi lovers/experts might want to steer clear."}
{"text":"The power went out while we were eating. We waited 40 min to get our check back because the system was down.... Our server was nice about it but didn't even think to discount or offer us anything for our trouble. Even though a power outage is out of their control, customer service is obviously not a priority. I'll be heading to the Scottsdale RA from now on."}
{"text":"I went here only once and it was anything but impressive. I only ordered one roll and I remember it having mango in it. I was originally excited about trying a sushi roll with mango, but it was the absolute worst sushi I have ever tried to eat. The mango wasn't even ripe, and the mixture of flavors was totally off. I'm rating two stars only because the appearance of the restaurant was very nice, and even though I went there during the day I imagine that at night it is really a nice place to look at...just not eat at."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. Super noisy on Saturday night. Ask for a table outside if you want to have a conversation without having to yell. Hotel staff said it is a very different atmosphere during the week."}
{"text":"Great sushi!!!!!! Sat at the bar during happy hour, Hayden was our bartender and he recommended everything we tried and it was all amazing."}
{"text":"This place deserves some major props for being one of few great happy hour joints, serving up drinks and appetizers that are actually affordable on the strip! The food is decent, the prices are good, and it's a nice change of pace from the usual pregaming at the buffets or pregaming at the hotels.   Make sure you come early to avoid long waits. And for something different from your half yard, try the fish bowl and I guarantee you a good time."}
{"text":"I am an out-of-towner (from San Francisco), but have been going to RA on Scottsdale Rd since before they expanded their dining room and continue to be impressed with their service, quality of food, and their atmosphere. My first time in AZ, I was skeptical about sushi in the desert. Those reservations have long since been quelled. Their food has consistently been fresh, creatively prepared and delicious. My favorite: their Lobster-Shrimp roll on a pesto sauce. And they NEVER have run out of TORO when I wanted it-- I would add a 1/2 star for that, if I could. The service has always been efficient and professional with groups ranging from 2 to 10. The atmosphere is consistently upbeat, fun, playing the latest in pop/top 40 music, but never so loud you can't have a conversation. A great spot to start the night before heading out in Old Town."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best sushi restaurants I've ever eaten at. We got four different rolls, and all were amazing. One was a seasonal roll with spicy tuna and avocado crusted on top, another was the ra-lipop, and another was some sort of lobster roll. I forget the fourth. But it was all so good I wish there was a branch where I live. Definitely will be going back next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Poor quality, old fish. Expensive. I will not go back. They need better sushi at the infamous Scottsdale downtown."}
{"text":"I've been to Ra a few times in the past year and I have yet to dine there!  Like other yelpers mentioned, you come for the atmosphere and to people watch!    My last couple of visits have been on Sunday nights, late Sunday nights.  It's Service Industry Night (S.I.N.), and they have food and drink specials from 8 pm to midnight.  It's crowded by the bar, and the restaurant is still hopping.  Grab a drink and take a seat outside if you want to chitchat or in my case last night, sit under the heating lamp to stay warm.  A lot of locals hang out there despite it being on the strip.  Located in Fashion Show Mall, it can carry a crowd depending on the night.  As of late, they were advertising Reggae Nights and 80s Nights.  You'll find a small dance floor and if the DJ is spinning out some good tunes, it'll be too crowded for you to bust a move.  But that's okay, there are some good-looking people here that are worth watching out for.  When I leave Ra, I see red...  Maybe someday I'll come by and try out their happy hour from 4 pm to 7 pm on weekdays.  Or just swing by during their regular hours and have a taste of their Signature Sushi.  Update! 03/19/08 - Why do I always find myself here on Sunday nights?  This time I had a chance to sit down and try the food.  We lucked out with a party of ten at 11:30 pm with no reservations.  We only had to wait about ten minutes to grab a table.    I took advantage of their SIN food specials and got the Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($3.25), the Spicy Tuna Roll ($3.75), and the Scallop Dynamite ($3.50).  There's nothing special about these rolls, they use Sriracha  to make it spicy, and it's not one of my favorite ways to do it.  We thought the Scallop Dynamite was going to be a roll, but it's actually scallops and Asian mushrooms baked in their 'Dynamite' sauce.  It's pretty tasty, and the BF was eating up all the onions that came along with it.  I also tried their Coconut Shrimp Tempura ($3.75).  It comes with about four deep fried shrimps on skewers with a roasted pineapple dipping sauce.  It's probably best to eat them while their hot, it was okay by the time I got to them.    The really great thing about their SIN drink specials is the $1.00 Warm Sakes.  However, they ran out of Sake flasks (tokkuris)!  The waitress arrived with our sake in wide rimmed glasses which pretty much defeats the purpose of the flask which is to prevent the heat from escaping!  They also ran out of sake cups (ochokos), so we asked for shot glasses.  She was completely out of that as well!  She did apologize profusely and it appeared she actually went around to look.  They just didn't have enough people cleaning up the tables and washing the dishes.  (I personally think it's a management problem and they should be used to their busy Sunday nights and sake drinking crowds.  Running out of tokkuris and ochokos really is unacceptable.)  As a result, I brought their rating from a four to a three."}
{"text":"This scene is the hippest restaurant in Scottsdale. Young attractive, friendly wait staff, loud music, very loud music, not a place to talk business but after business talk. Ok, no business talk when you are scoping the scenes. Place to meet people is the bar. I usually avoid club like scenes because many years of loud music has damaged some hearing drums. And I'm usually just shaking my head when someone is talking to me. But, my friend wants to check it out. It is a Friday night and only one restaurant has a crowd out side the door. We go up to the three hostess and try our luck at getting a seat. My friend wants sushi and I really need to just chill and forget the days work so I cross my fingers in both hands and tell myself that all the good karmas I've collected throughout the years, I should be able to cash in some for this. Easy...get a table for two without a wait. Now thats collecting on good karma. Walking to our table I check out the plates on other peoples table and already know what to order as appertizers. Presentation of their food gets an A+. Our lovely waitress is hip in her old converse, knows her japanese food and traditional pour of sake. As my friend is having fun, I too am happy that we were able to get in, because I was getting sick of eating in ritzy, expensive places with suits around me. Sometimes it's the mood that makes a restaurant, not just the food. Though, the food is above average if not great. Our meals included two beers, two cold sake, four appetizers, four main course came to be under 90 bucks without tip. Would I go back? Heck yes, in fact my goal is try to find another hip sushi place in San Francisco or San Jose.  Who would have known this kind of place exist in Scottsdale? It is smack in the middle of tourist area where they have shops with indian motives, blown glass, so many beautiful paintings. You get to walk the strip and meet some natives, no not indians, Arizonians and other out of towners and party while shopping for very expensive items. Case in point, I saw this Dancer In Red painting but it was 12 grand. Too rich for my blood but I can always do my own and will. Arizona is the new Florida for the rich or retired. I would move here if it wasn't for the pollen count is so high. But, many people fly in for the weekend to Scottsdale for a very different scene. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went here to meet a friend who lives here in Vegas while visiting. I was a bit worried after reading the various reviews. When we first walked in I was thrown by the loud music but soon they began playing more familiar toons. Somehow when the music is familiar it doesn't seem so loud.   We started with edamame which was pretty good. It was steamed just right and not soggy plus they used those nice flakes of salt. Next came the miso soup and again yummy. Unfortunately from there the meal was just so so. I had the shrimp tempura bento box, and he had the chicken teriyaki bowl. We shared the ultimate shrimp roll. The food honestly was just bland.  Those who know me will be amazed to hear me say that as I tend to like blander foods.  The sushi roll was nothing spectacular and really not rolled very well. The shrimp and bento box was just so so and I was disappointed that they had no sweet n sour or duck sauce. Even acted like I was daft for asking for it. Those who joined us got a couple of rolls and felt it was so so too. They got the spicy salmon roll and asked for a new one as there was no spice taste at all.   The service was so so. It wasn't terribly so there was no reason they didn't check on us a bit more. Basically they just seemed a bit nonchalant about it all. Honestly I'd skip this place. There must be better sushi places in Vegas."}
{"text":"Ra Sushi offers average sushi grade.  This chain of restaurants offers a hip atmosphere with loud music and a great place to take down some drinks while eating.    As an Asian I'm a little more passionate about the rating topic for Ra.  If you don't have much  to say about a restaurant please think about rating it four stars."}
{"text":"Service was great - all the rolls we had were amazing and we kept some for leftover that stayed delicious even until the next day! Great location too."}
{"text":"The food was OK. I've had way better sushi off the Las Vegas Strip. The bartender Jenny was awesome though so I would consider her for future drinks but dinner again?? Eh I would considered somewhere else. It was ok. Soy sauce was super salty"}
{"text":"Great sushi.  Only complaint would be its very crowded and loud.  Otherwise, just great sushi."}
{"text":"Decent sushi. We called the restaurant ahead of time to ask if there would be a wait around 7 pm. They couldn't take our name but told us there was no need to worry at all. When we arrived, there was a wait. Go figure. And when we were seated, there were empty tables everywhere. Anyway, aside from that fiasco, the sushi was pretty standard fare. The nigiri was nothing special and the rainbow and California rolls were good. We also had edamame, vegetable tempura, and seaweed salad. The edamame was harder to eat than usual, but good. We liked the vegetable tempura but wished there was more variety! The seaweed salad was good. Overall, I think RA is a good place to get your sushi fix but there is certainly much better sushi out there."}
{"text":"I tried their happy hour and did not enjoy much of the dishes. The rice was very dry which made the rolls not enjoyable. The service was probably the only thing I enjoyed. Perhaps their non-happy hour menu items are better (but they did not offer anything else at the late hour). Was not really impressed and would not recommend unfortunately. I believe you can find better at the price elsewhere. Probably more for transient folks who do not eat sushi often."}
{"text":"Prompt service, Good HH prices and a large patio.  This is a chain but always consistent."}
{"text":"I only come here for happy hour--Love their happy hour food and prices... This was the first RA i went to before they opened up the SoCal locations.  You must try their \"RA\"ckin Shrimp, it is delicious!! I don't know if its new or if they only have this in Vegas..but it is definitely GOOD!!!!  Also looks like they started adding mini tapas plates for hh $5~~which weren't too bad... I think they are opening up for more options on their menu... Their food is good, all their items on the hh menu and their sake is only $2"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian sushi! The veggie tempura- to die for! The pineapple wontons with pineapple sauce - great!! If I could eat here every day... I'd would! Great service. Great food. Great drinks. Great seating! Luv it!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery with postmates.Worst tasting japanese food i've ever tried plus they forgot to put roll in my order.Will never order from them again"}
{"text":"So I can here with my co-worker. Instant amazing greeting at the front!!! We were sat at the sushi bar. There's a chief from Wisconsin, who lived and learned his craft in Japan."}
{"text":"Ra is the Denny's of sushi....Flo will take your order, when she gets around to it....zero sushi bar experience. when it comes to a sushi place smaller is better. and not to be raciest but the more Japanese the better."}
{"text":"This place needs a face-lift, the whole concept and decor is outdated and needs some help. I think their sushi and other food items are alright, although they try to be so trendy and in reality there menu is pretty blah. Its a fun place to grab a drink and sit on the patio, but the excitement and trendiness of this place is completely gone."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I happened to come across this place by chance. We were seated quickly for a Saturday night and our server was awesome. We ordered a Philadelphia roll, Spicy Tuna roll and the Spicy Chicken Teriyaki Udon. They make the Philadelphia rolls how I like them, with the salmon IN the roll! Everything tasted awesome and the prices were very decent for being such a nice place. Great music and happy vibe to the restaurant. The only thing was I ordered the iced green tea, and it's not green tea but barley tea. Would love to go back to this place again on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"We had an 8 o'clock reservation for five on a Tuesday night. They didn't seat us until 9!! We all knew what we wanted to order and did so at the earliest chance, but it still took  well over 45 minutes to get our food. Such a sloppily managed place."}
{"text":"I think I've been here over 15 times and I absolutely love it, made it a tradition to go get sushi from RA when we want to get sushi, haha the service is excellent, the servers are always smiling and happy to see us when we walk in. I usually go in for happy hour sushi since it's very cheap and tasty, I love the calamari, Vegas, and rainbow rolls, I highly recommend this location if you want to have a relaxing sushi date with a friend or anyone."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try RA for awhile now, the one by my house in San Diego has horrible parking as it's downtown so this was great as it was walking distance to the my hotel I was staying in, the Tempe Mission Palms.  I always think all sushi tastes good and somewhat similar from cheaper to high end places but I will say the food I had here last night was by far superb!  I enjoyed the yellowtail in some type of garlic citrus sauce and then I wasn't going to get the seared tuna as I had eaten tuna for lunch but my server Gabby told me it was one of their best plates so I chose that over the salmon.  I'm so glad I got it as it was delicious, some of the best fish I've eaten.  The creamy soy dressing it comes in is really delicious and I can't tolerate to much dairy so the fact it was made with soy and not cream was even better!  The couple next to me also let me try a piece of some chilli sashimi and everything else on the menu looked good. They do have a great happy hour menu from 4-7 and I would have liked to have gotten there for that but the server did let me know they do a reverse HH also from 10pm - midnight which is great on the nights you want a late dinner but a light one.  I have another day here in AZ so maybe I'll make the reverse one before I go. They also have a great alcohol selection and I had a really nice Pinot noir. Very clean facility, trendy spot, great decor, nice servers, lots of seating places, good alcohol and of course great food!   The only one thing I would have liked to have seen is some rolls without rice."}
{"text":"I've wanted to check out this place for a long time. So when Jessie asked me to do some shopping at the Fashion Show Mall and dinner here at Ra Sushi I was so down!   If you don't want to deal with the mall Ra has it's own entrance independent of the mall. I love that they have a patio that faces the strip. Totally made me feel like we we're playing tourist. The inside of Ra has a huge bar and tons of booths. Of course they have a large sushi bar so you can sit at watch all the action. But since it was a nice day we sat on the patio. There was some construction blocking our view, but it wasn't that big of a deal. It still was fun to watch all the people passing by.   Jessie had her birthday gift certificate that they give you on your half birthday and it's for $20. If you sign up on Ra Sushi's website ( ra sushi.com ) you can get one too.   Since it was happy hour we took advantage of it by ordering the Citrus Garlic Yellowtail and the Ra Chips and salsa. Jessie ordered the Sashimi plate and some edamame. The Citrus Garlic Yellowtail was sliced so thin and the ponzu sauce gave it great flavor. The Ra Chips and Salsa was my favorite. It was tuna tartar that was mixed with avocado, cucumber, soy sauce and a fresh salsa. Instead of regular chips they had wonton chips that complimented it so well. Jessie's Sashimi plate was beautifully presented. The cuts of Salmon, Yellowtail, Tuna, and Whitefish were cut so thin and came with a bowl of rice. The fish was so sweet and the soy sauce accented it perfectly.   Our server was great! She kept our drinks filled and even brought us out more ice when she noticed ours had melted. She also had our food out at a fast pace.   I can not wait to return to Ra Sushi! I've been dreaming about that Sashimi plate and the Ra Chips and Salsa. Those two items are a perfect meal. They do also have items other then sushi on the menu. This is a plus when you have people that don't like sushi and you do. I'll definitely be returning soon. They definitely get a huge YUM from me!"}
{"text":"The hostess, Morgan, was so sophisticated. My party was a 12 top with two kids and she gave us such a wonderful table even though it was super busy! Such a great experience, can't wait to make it a regular spot. Phenomenal service and awesome food, HIGHLY recommended."}
{"text":"BEST happy hour in vegas and amazing $1 sake i go quite often"}
{"text":"Happy Hour! Happy Hour! Happy Hour!!!  They include almost every regular menu item in their HH menu, so the choices are plenty and the prices are fantastic given the portions.  I ordered 3 rolls just for myself (yeah, I'm a greedy B) thinking the rolls would be the usual HH size, but they weren't sized down, and I had way too much food.    As far as food quality, I was pleased.  I'm not a huge nigiri or chirashi fan, and thus, cannot speak to the true quality and freshness of the fish.  I stick to the mostly rice filled, sauce topped rolls, and those did not disappoint.  The crispy spicy tuna, which probably wasn't sushi at all, was really good, as well as the Viva Las Vegas roll.    Service was good, and given the large party, they did a fine job.    Taking a look at the regular prices, I'd probably give them 3 stars, but for HH, they certainly earned the extra one."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in a mall with the quality and experience comparable to a nondescript mall found anywhere across the U.S.  I sat down at the sushi bar and was the only person even though the restaurant was more than half full.  The chefs were spending all there time making rolls.  I decided to order the sashimi platter with tuna, yellowtail and salmon.  The main chef did a great job of slicing the fish, but the quality was average at the best.  I wanted to go omakase and ask for the chef recommendations, but figured the quality would be comparable for the uni, alabacore, etc.  If you do go try the rolls since nigiri/sashimi can be confirmed as a waste.  Service was very good, so thanks for that!"}
{"text":"Let me tell you this place is not worth the price! The service is very slow and the food is OK. I order the Chicken Katsu ($15) and it was very dry and tasteless. Ono Hawaiian serves better katsu then they do and it way cheaper. My guest had a steak entree ($18) and it came out super rare, they put it back the grill but by the time my guest got to the veggies they were soaked in blood. Totally gross. The waitress was slow and took forever to bring out the food and our refills. She never removed the dirty dishes off our table until I neatly stacked them to make room. This place is suppose to be based off their sushi and let me tell you that Fry's fresh daily made sushi taste so much better. Not an exaggeration! Save yourself $63 bucks for 2 and go elsewhere. I always recommend Kabuki. They never disappoint. Maybe it's because college students work here, that's why service is so sucky. Then again the food tells all."}
{"text":"Came for HH.  SERVICE: it was like our waitress was playing red light green light. At times she was super attentive, but at other points during the meal we couldn't find/flag her down if our lives depended on it.  AMBIANCE: Dark and sexy, RA had better music than in the clubs! Total dance party inside.  FOOD: RA has a special HH menu with a flight pricing system from $3-7. Cocktails were ~$4-5 and hot sake was only $2! - Yellowtail and salmon nigiri: pretty good for the price - Crispy spicy tuna: the \"crispy\" rice block was oddly chewy and not crispy at all. - Grilled short ribs: extra grilled charcoal flavor not appreciated; this was also greasy and tough - Miso soup: for $4 this was a total rip off. - Rainbow roll: pretty good - Seaweed salad: the hit of the night. YUM!  OVERALL: Totally worth it for HH. I think the total bill for 6 was around $90 including tax+tip... and this was feeding three hungry boys and three HANGRY girls!"}
{"text":"Just stopped by here for a quick bite before the movie.. they just opened and it wasn't busy yet.. the waiter took forever to come in between to check on us and it felt like he was giving us attitude because we didn't order that much.. the food was okay but their service just needs an improvement.."}
{"text":"This place...has so much potential. I say that mainly because of where it is located, but unfortunately for them, my reviews are based on their food and service - not location.   All of  the food we ordered (edamame, spicy tuna roll, ultimate shrimp tempura roll, and steamed veggies) felt less than fresh. The hot food came out borderline cold and the sushi just did not seem fresh.   Our server seemed stressed and forgot our soy sauce which I had to go retrieve after waiting a while and it took a very long time to get the bill.   My last gripe is about the noise level. It would not be an issue unless you are sitting outside next to the restaurant that they border (which we were). RA was playing one station very loudly and the restaurant next store was competing with a completely different station making it hard to think, let alone speak.   Maybe happy hour would have been different, but for dinner...not recommended!"}
{"text":"Ra is our favorite go to sushi restaurant when looking for a quick bite and a cocktail. Lots of great cocktails to chose from. Sushi always tastes fresh."}
{"text":"You've gotta be kidding me, Ra.  I think you deserve to be kicked off the Las Vegas Strip.  For all those that think they're in for a treat after shopping at the Fashion Show Mall and craving for Sushi, DON'T BE TEMPTED TO GO TO RA!!  As convenient as it may be being right outside of the mall.  As inviting as it looks to lure you in and come inside.  DON'T DO IT.  Ra, please tell us why in the world it takes almost ONE HOUR to get 4 orders of Sushi when we saw 6 sushi chefs behind the bar?  Ok, we understand that it's crowded on New Year's Day which our horrible waitress claimed that was the reason why the pace was slow but seriously, ONE HOUR?    Our hot food came out before our sushi order did.  Our waitress didn't even have the courtesy to keep us updated on what was going on until we had to ask.  When we did ask all she could say was that it's busy and that \"it's like that every year on New Year's day\"  In our opinion, we've been to much busier restaurants with much friendlier service.  And another thing-- don't you think that if the restaurant knew that every year that New Year's day especially would be busy then maybe they would up the staf coverage for that day?  Hmmm, poor planning on management's part.  The sushi came out WITHOUT wasabi and ginger, uhmmmm.....pardon us for expecting those things to come with it.  Call me crazy but I just thought that was a GIVEN.  Didn't know you had to ask for wasabi and ginger with Sushi!!  And lastly, NOT FRESH and BAD fish.  When one person had a stomach ache afterwards we thought, eh....maybe it was something you ate earlier.  When another had a stomach ache we knew......yep must be the sushi and the bad service at Ra.  OVERPRICED. BAD SERVICE. BAD SUSHI."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time here. The hostess Red hair) was very friendly and seated us right away. There were four waiters in our area. 10 minutes turned into 20 minutes and not one waiter came to our table. At least one of them could have came to ask if we wanted water. Two new bales were seated with drinks and one even had appetizers. I would normally leave a place like this but my daughter was hungry. I went to ask the hostess (red hair) if I could speak to a manager, she said ok and went to look for him. The second hostess(blond) asked what the problem was and I told her. She stated that they had a rush and were busy ( all while looking at her phone. The manager  (James) came out and after explaining the situation, James apologized and said that he would help. James appeared to be disappointed and wanted to make my first experience better. James took our orders and eventually our waiter came. Our waiter Jack stated that there was a mix up in the rotation blah blah blah because each waiter looked right in my face and said nothing. Jack however did put his best kiss ass attitude on from that point on. The food was excellent and if it were not for James, I wouldn't return. James did alter out bill by taking one roll, seaweed salad and $10 extra off of our bill. James is a great manager. as long as they have people like him and Red hair, I will be back and change the amount of stars"}
{"text":"Ra ra, ah ah ah Want your bad romance  I want your rolls I want your sake I want your everything As long as it's free  Ra: That pretty much sums up how I feel about you. I love going here, but only for happy hour when it's so cheap it feel like it's free. You also have a cool patio. Otherwise, your bathroom stinks, and outside of HH, your prices and food do too."}
{"text":"I needed to go shopping but needed some food so I dropped in for happy hour.  I ordered:  Dengaku tofu ($4)- this was a generous portion (8 slabs) and the tofu was silken and had a bit of roast veggies on top, but there was  oppmpf needed in the flavor. It was in tempura sauce with a drizzle of eel sauce but needed more of the eel for flavor.  I added a bit of soy, and ate it with sushi ginger for some bite.  Crispy Spicy Tuna ($5)- I love this at other sushi bars, but this version was just okay. It had a very big piece of rice and it was a bit cold so the crisp rice piece wasn't actually crispy since I suspect it was pre done.   Crispy Onion Albacore ($5)- it was decent but not the best quality of albacore and very thin slices topped with some sesame dressing, French's onion, a bit of sprouts.   The server was friendly and kept up with drinks and checked on me whenever she passed by.   I think it's a good option when you are a tourist since there is very few happy hours or \"deals\" on the strip and there are a good amount of options on the HH menu. I don't think it's a HH I would go out of my way to go on the strip for though."}
{"text":"This is a regular date night spot for my husby and I. We like to have dinner there then walk over and watch a movie next door. The food is normally very good, safe and tasty and the drinks are great as well. However on our last visit our waitress totally messed up our entire order and brought us items we didn't order and forgot the items we did order. It took forever to get it right and it wasn't even a busy night so not sure what happened. It was a disappointment as this is a fav spot for us, but better luck next time."}
{"text":"AMBIANCE: 4 - It's actually quite dark and mysterious inside and gives kind of a romantic vibe, even in the afternoon, because of the lighting. It would be really nice for a date night. Or if you just want to feel fancy while you're on the strip.   SERVICE: 3 - The service is good, but not great. The staff is very polite and professional. It's really refreshing after a stressful shopping trip..except now, you're breaking your wallet even more...with food.   FOOD: 2 - The food was okay. I had a beef bento box, and I also tasted my friend's sushi dishes, because she's always one that is up to share with others. My bento box just didn't mesh together well. The flavors don't really compliment each other. The beef was average, and everything else on the box was below average. It's just nothing to write home about, but it is satisfying if you are crazy starving and still want to shop some more at the mall (but don't want to move).   It's a very easy and accessible place to revisit because of it's location, but it just didn't taste very good. I would not come back to pay full price. Maybe if I was seriously starving, I might come back to happy hour."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not the best.  The staff was really entertaining and I think that's what made up for the average food. Our poor waitress had to deal with my 2 obnoxious friends who were visiting Vegas. Need I say more? ha.  Their happy hour has legit prices but I would not pay full price. The sushi is decent but I tend to be a sushi snob so this place just didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"Because of its prime location across from the Wynn on the north end if the strip it would be so easy for this place to take advantage of the tourist traffic. Instead, RA offers a reasonably priced, extensive menu featuring some inventive and tasty offerings. Try the RA- llipop ( a skewered sushi roll). The cocktails are outstanding! I enjoyed three. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is nightclub classy with some outdoor seating overlooking the mall and Las Vegas Blvd."}
{"text":"This is our favorite sushi restaurant in Vegas. We love the Viva Las Vegas Roll and Crazy Monkey is deeeelicious! I love that it is casual and not over expensive like some of the sushi restaurants we've been to. Quality of food is usually good."}
{"text":"I serve at a restaurant down the street and I know with every crazy spring training season it is easy for people to forget the hard work we are putting in to make a restaurant great. The three at the host desk tonight were absolutely amaxing!! I placed a quick Togo order and the guy that helped me was SOOO NICE! I wish I had got his name because he deserves serious recognition. I will be placing orders more often because of his kindness!"}
{"text":"Myself and my boyfriend went at the very beginning of happy hour (3, 4 PM ish?) on a Friday to try Ra out and it was amazing. I feel it is better than the Sushi 101 near campus. Lower lighting, cobblestone-type floors, modern decor. We were seated right away from walking in, no appointment needed beforehand or anything. Our waiter was great and recommended to us what we should try. We were seated at the sushi bar so we even got to see our food get made and interact with the sushi chef and got recommendations from him based on what we liked already. I ended up getting the Calimari rolls and my bf had the Crazy Monkey roll. We sampled each other's dishes...amazing. Calimari rolls were crunchy and perfect, like the sushi version of a crispy chicken sandwich. The monkey roll was dense and interesting with a very unexpected palette of taste (there was mango inside it too!) Aesthetically amazing and tasted the same :)"}
{"text":"The service was not good. We had to search out our own soy sauce (the one on our table was empty). Our drinks were left empty for most of the meal. This was despite the fact that we were there on a Saturday afternoon and there were very few other patrons there.  We ordered two rolls, an appetizer and a bowl of steamed rice for the baby to snack on. The food was just ok. I would have liked more wasabi, but I never had a chance to ask because our server just didn't come around.  I had not been to Ra in years and I would say that the quality has declined. I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"Working at Fashion Show Mall, I frequent RA as their Happy Hour is unsurpassed. Great drink and roll specials. One thing I love is they don't get lazy with the simple rolls. Even their California Rolls are deelish. (I only know this from eating off of my friends' plates). Some of the best dishes they have aren't sushi at all. The Tuna Salad is bomb.com. Tuna Sashimi on a bed of greens and an awesome sweet/spicy dressing. I am sure the menu describes it better, but just eat it and be amazed. I recently tried the Lobster Spring Rolls. The roll is crispy and flaky and the lobster is always perfectly prepared. It comes atop what I think is a mango puree AKA mango baby food, but the mix of the lobster, cream cheese and super sweet puree makes for a party on the tongue. A couple tips, Fashion Show Mall employees receive a discount (I think 10% off total not including alcohol) and if you check in on Foursquare and tell your server, you get a free order of edamame or a bowl of miso soup. I also like that the entire staff is aware of their Foursquare specials and don't act jerky when you ask for free things."}
{"text":"When you get a deal its so easy to overlook the obvious flaws of a place. Sushi Ra is a just that A good deall! They have a happy hour from 3-7p mon to sat and reverse happy hour from 10-1p. It's decent sushi on the strip. It's far enough away from chaos so it feels pretty chill especially after the mall has closed. There is a nice outdoor patio playing some techno but it mixes into the music playing at the adjacent restaurant which was Latin based so that's a little distracting. Service is a little bit of a challenge but I guess its a \"get what you pay for kinda place\"!  All I can say is come for the deal. It comes with free Las Vegas people watching and The Wynn's big screen if you're really bored."}
{"text":"Ra is always busy. If you have something to celebrate, coming here with a big group of people is always fun. Birthdays, graduations or just because...it's a safe bet that you'll have a great time. They have a really good looking wait staff...they must submit headshots with their applications.  With attractive people everywhere and loud music playing, you'll probably get more of a club vibe from this place than a sushi restaurant.  I think a lot of guys come here just for drinks and to hit on chicks. But then again, maybe chicks do the same thing.  I say 'eh' to their sushi but if you're looking for a loud, fun place filled with energy to grab something to eat before going out, this is it, hands down."}
{"text":"They've gotten worse since I've been here last. The salad they serve with lunch is literally the worst salad that I've ever tasted. I really wouldn't care about that, but everything else sucked as well. The sashimi tasted iffy, especially the salmon, and the mango lobster roll is straight up garbage. I should've known when I saw how cheap it was and read the description that mentioned \"lobster mix\" as part of the filling.   Lastly, a la carte fish is double of what I'm used to paying. Uni at 13.50 per piece?! Gtfoh."}
{"text":"Great spot!  Sit in Hailey's section"}
{"text":"This place is overly trendy and the sushi isn't very good at all. Two stars for the sake bomber happy hour specials."}
{"text":"We were craving sushi and found RA through Yelp. I placed my order and found out a tempura roll would be 20 mins... so I opted for the tuna roll. Pretty good flavor, fresh, good portion but a little more expensive - after adding an iced tea I was at $18!   It was 2pm on a Saturday and not very busy, but service was slow."}
{"text":"Went here only because my favorite sushi place closed down early. This place is usually pretty overpriced and not the best sushi. This past time I didn't have very good service, as I think the server wanted to leave, and my sushi wasn't very good either. Won't be coming back if I can help it"}
{"text":"Is RA Sushi owned by a white guy?  FOOD: If your looking for authentic Asian flavor, you're on the wrong end of Spring Mountain. RA is a fancified, Americanized Japanese restaurant. And no, fancified is not a real word. Every time I come here, I'm surrounded by modern california rolls that look like Bobby Flay threw up on them. I usually order nigiri during happy hour. Fish quality isn't that great --just saying.  RA \"CHIPS & SALSA: GOOD! Basically tuna tar tar and its surprisingly good. SPICY CHICKEN YAKISOBA: soggy udon noodles, not spicy EDAMAME: some days they're hot, some days they're cold NIGIRI: not the freshest, fish to rice ratio bites ROLLS: lots of mayo, creamcheese, or some strange salsa thrown on it  DRINKS: Full bar. Happy Hour specials for Sake & Beer (for sake bombs) is a good deal!  SERVICE: BAD FOR GROUPS! The only time I'm here is for group functions. The servers are easily confused. They always run out of shot glasses for sake bombs. They forget to refill waters and drinks.  SPLITTING CHECKS: For large groups, our server made a check for every 3-4 people. Not too difficult. However, for groups over 6 people, gratuity is automatically calculated 20% each check. This is WAY TOO MUCH for these incompetent servers.  Food isn't bad. Its just not the type of Japanese I'm used to eating. Think 'real' Mexican food in comparison to Taco Bell. My non-asian friends like it here. My asian friends do not."}
{"text":"I ordered yellowtail nigiri (2pcs) and it came AFTER my Vegas roll, Shrimp roll, and potstickers... The service at this location leaves more to be desired.. Also, please please level out the stone path with the floor.. My mom tripped on it and kinked her ankle."}
{"text":"Pretty good happy hour. Not very authentic sushi. I hate people who think the can say they \"LOVE RA\" but the only thing they get are the California rolls. If you're looking for authentic Japanese sushi- stay away. Fun atmosphere, pretty good service, cheap happy hour, but I've def had better sushi."}
{"text":"i've have had dinner  at this place a few times thru out the years and its always been hit or miss"}
{"text":"For sushi in the desert RA is pretty good. I recommend the Vegas roll almost everything I have had has been pretty good. This location is not as packed as the one on Scottsdale rd or Mill if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Terrible service the manager was horrible to me I can't believe that this is even allowed to happen or you feel extraordinarily degraded and can't believe the way I was treated bad and I was told it was my fault"}
{"text":"are you kidding? you can't call yourself a sushi restaurant. we ordered several rolls . sashimis, spicy miso soup, teriyaki chicken bento for my son and some salads. the rice on the rolls were seasonless. the fish used on the rolls were so thin and insignificant that it was just rice balls. the shrimp was so over cooked and rubbery as well as the chicken teriyaki. I will not eat here again.sorry"}
{"text":"This was probably the worst customer service I've received in a long time. Took them over 10 minutes to tell me they didn't have the ingredients to make the drink I ordered. After I said not to worry about it, the bartender then took the food menu & walked away. So much for having dinner here. This place is horrible."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was wonderful and so cozy! And I only went to do pick up not dine in. The food was ready and fresh when I got there.(I ordered via Yelp) and the service was great no complaints. Also reasonably priced for the amount you get!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING- Posting this because I went here for the first time Friday afternoon, ate a rainbow roll, and suffered from terrible food poisoning. Sucks because I love sushi and this place has basically traumatized me. Service was not good either (wasn't even busy) and talk about overpriced."}
{"text":"I always have a good time when I go to Ra. It's not my first choice for sushi, but I like it's fun environment and spacious dining room. Go for happy hour to save some coin and eat some good food if you're in Old Town."}
{"text":"LOUD. Loud, loud, loud.  That's seriously the only thing I can think of when anyone suggests Ra. The music is blasting so loud that you have to yell across the table to your companion - definitely not a pleasant dining experience. - 2 stars.  The girls (yeah, I've NEVER had a male waiter or host here) are pleasant enough but service is a bit slow. - 1 star.  On the other hand, the food is good and really reasonably priced - I recall Happy Hour being around $18 for a couple iced teas, Vegas Rolls, and a few other rolls, having some left to take home even. Otherwise, it was $36 for dinner the last time I went.  So, as a compromise the last time Ra was suggested, I dragged my oh-so-tolerant date to the Ahwatukee location. It was MUCH QUIETER and the service was surprisingly good, despite it being 10 pm on a Saturday with a packed bar. It was worth the 5 miles to Ray and I-10, because the sushi is definitely good."}
{"text":"1 star is a compliment for this place. The service is literally terrible every single time. Servers don't check on their tables, they don't introduce themselves, and they never look happy. Not only do the servers suck, the entire rest of the staff just seems unhappy and rude in general. Avoid this location."}
{"text":"Service was HORRIBLE!  Over 2 hours to get food delivered to table. Their excuse?  They bring orders out \"family style\" as (and whenever) sushi dude gets things done.  So, person with specific food choices has to twiddle thumbs while \"lucky\" odd person gets their order delivered.   And- adding insult to injury- food when delivered is only mediocre at best  Stay away"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would, If I had the energy I would rate every Ra in the country this \"0\". Thank you to the Muslims for inventing the 0 as a concept. This place is completely cliched, lame, and annoying, oh did I mention the sushi is sub par, the service usually sucks, since they must only require an IQ of 28 to work here.   \"Yes, Billy  the fork is the thing with the four prongs on it....\"*new waiter proceeds to bring said fork to table*   You can go to so many better places for sushi in Phoenix, going here is only cool if you want to leave partly deaf. Even their happy hour is weak.  ABRA = Anthing but Ra."}
{"text":"I must admit, I like The Hives, the Swedish neo-punk band, they have catchy tunes. I don't however like hives you receive from an allergic reaction from sushi.   Yes, it is true, Ra tried to kill me. I went to this Ra, not following my mantra ABRA (anything but Ra) and met my parents for dinner. For some unknown reason they love Ra. I figured , what the hell, it's their favorite place so I'll just roll with it. (or sashimi with it) The food was fine for Ra standards, all I had was my  normal assorted sashimi plate with a side bowl of rice. Keep in mind I eat sushi almost every week, and sometimes twice a week. Only once before did I get a little sick from sushi, if I remember correctly, I didn't touch the stuff for like 6 months :(   When you get some sort of \"food poisoning\" you really try to figure out what the hell went wrong that day. As I awoke Sunday a bit itchy, I noticed some small red spots appearing and disappearing. Throughout the day I realized, I was have an allergic reaction to \"something\" I have NO allergies, so this is new for me.   As I thought back, I had to blame the sushi, it was the only unique thing I had all day. I kept wondering, what fish was to blame? The tuna, octopus, white fish, salmon? I think the culprit was either the white fish or octopus, I eat neither that often.   I have to say, having the \"hives\" isn't as much fun as listening to The Hives.   I hate Ra, so much more now. ..HATE HATE HATE it. I mean, once you are poisoned by a place, it looses it's luster.   Yes, eating Sushi is a risk, but I have been an avid sushi fan for about 6 years now, and never really had this type of problem before.   Either way, benadryl works wonders with hives. I am no Elephant Man, but the redness, and itching does make you feel a bit uncomfortable, and also conscience of your appearance.  I just wonder if I'll be off sushi for a while....."}
{"text":"We were there for a week and went twice!  This is not the best sushi restaurant in the world, although it's good.  It IS a great place to go for creative Japanese-style appetizers at an incredible happy hour price (everything half price if I'm remembering properly).  I can still remember the enticing umami flavors in the gyoza, mmmm... sorry, I spaced out for a moment there!  Eating inside is incredibly loud, but the service is great and it's completely worth it.  We were fortunate enough to go on a night that was not too hot and sat outside under the spritzers, which was perfect."}
{"text":"Service by Taye was outstanding but whoever cooked the RA ckin shrimp got me and my neice and my sister so sick. To the point I had to fly home from on an emergency flight from Las Vegas to Los Angeles that cost me $100 on top of the bill that was $70 to see my hospital Ucla because I've had a kidney transplant and I have heart issues and I need to be seen by my Drs who know me plus Vegas ERs suck. I wonder if anyone else got sick from that night. 8/8/2016"}
{"text":"where can you go with 20+ppl at 3pm but do not want to spend too much as we are going to spend too much later on...RA Sushi for happy hour of course. we got there in perfect time as it was not busy and we were able to get a LONG table set up for all of us to sit.  Our poor waiter, i forgot his name, was running from one end to the other end taking orders. majority of the dishes came out to be about $5.  i think we did two to three orders of each items on the happy hour menu.  Drinks are about $5 and less.  we had sake flowing and everyone was full by the time we all left. as there were so many orders given at differnt times, some orders came out and some, we had to wait for some time. we also had to tell the waiter a few times about our drink orders as it did not come.  our waiter had a helper who brought us our food.  kinda bitchy as she just came out with food orders and not sure who ordered it.  AGAIN, we had a table of at least 20ppl, stop bringing the food to one area of ppl.  service was OK. food was OK. price was awesome. $20pp and we rolled out of there all full - priceless."}
{"text":"Having worked in Phoenix/Scottsdale area for 7 months, I started noticing a trend:  things often look much better than they really are.    While the interior decorator and designer did a great job with Ra's look and layout, the chef must've been playing hooky during Japanese cuisine sessions in culinary school.  The rolls leave much to be desired, the rice dishes have that familiar Americanized, supermarket taste, and the noodle dish that I ordered was at first MIA for 35 mins then DOA on taste and creativity.  The decor vs. cuisine imbalance is further slanted by the impressively dressed, ultra-primped, valley-type clientele who are served by the impressively dressed, ultra-primped, valley-type wait-staff.    They might not get your order right the first or 2nd time but dang't if they don't look good doing it."}
{"text":"Seriously the best service I've ever received! Coming from out of town the server was so good! She has awesome suggestions for sushi beginners like me! And helped us out with just around the area stuff. The manager on shift was totes on point! He was so awesome and chatty... He even bought us dessert! Definitely will come back again"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is the only time I come here, but for good reason! You can get 3 rolls for $15! Without a doubt my FAVORITE place to get sushi.  Rated a 4 instead of 5 because of the obnoxiously loud music - ask for the patio if you can brave the heat!"}
{"text":"Late night dinner date with my new prostitute friend !!! Just kidding.. Just kidding!! Lol . Glad to see one of my favorite sushi spots in Vegas !"}
{"text":"Before coming here I read the reviews and many were negative. Decided to ingore them and go in without any expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. The service was great, the sushi was good and the prices were decent. I'd even come here again. Especially if you want to pair sushi with a movie, because the AMC is right next door. Have I been to better sushi places, yes, but this place is still nothing to sneeze at. Give it a try! And go for the popular rolls, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My experience here was very disappointing. Came here for dinner during the weekend and the hostess was reluctant to seat us. I could clearly see the restaurant was NOT busy but for some reason she had a hard time finding us a table. After 15 minutes go by, we finally were sat down. I could barely read the menu because it was so dark. I had to use the flashlight on my phone just to see what was there. Our waiter was probably the only good thing that we experienced. The food was pricey for sub quality sushi. The saki tasted like spiked water. Just an overall disappointing experience. There are other Japanese restaurants you can go to in Vegas. I wouldn't recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I arrived at five and there were only five other people in the restaurant. I ordered a blushing geisha, seared tuna appetizer, a traditional spicy tuna roll, and Ra-lipops (a house specialty). The drink was way too sweet, the appetizer was tiny, and the entrees were bland. I love sushi and was really disappointed in the meal. Considering the prices are not cheap, I should have gone to Tokyo Joe's."}
{"text":"Delicious but I was disappointed because they were so far from traditional. I couldn't really tell, with all the sauce, what I was eating. Service was very nice and prices reasonable. Like I said, it was delicious just not what I expected from a sushi joint."}
{"text":"Foods good.  But the cleanness is not there other wise I would give a full 5 star but in not the cleanest establishment for being on the strip at fashion show mall.   Service is okay.  Again Food is good so I would still give it a try!"}
{"text":"Very dirty! The wall at our booth had food splattered all over it. Our preset plates each had a puddle of water in them and the highchair we requested was beyond disgusting so I kept my baby on my lap. Our food was decent and our server was very nice but the cleanliness factor left a bad taste my mouth."}
{"text":"If you want hip, fun, and live music while you're grubbing on some sushi, I recommend for everybody to come here.  I normally come here on Sundays because it's $1 Sake.  So for $10 I can get wasted and feel great!    Every time I walk in, the security already knows me and gives me a hug to greet me.  The setting is very laid back and casual.  There's no dress code and it's comfortable.  As I enter, on the right there's the DJ booth and there's always different DJ's spinning.  On Wednesday's they have an open spin night.  The decor is very modern with bamboos for plants.  There are some good art work on the wall to spice up the scenery inside.    As I walk a few steps more, there lies the bar and on most occasions that's where I'll end up but sometimes I'll take the table if I felt like it.  The stools are very comfortable and cushiony.  There are a lot of candles lit up through out the bar to give some lighting.  For the sports lovers, a huge flat screen TV hangs above the bar for some entertainment.  I've watched the Ms. USA on there one time.    The menu is mouthwatering and deliciouso.  I've eaten everything on there so I know it's all good.  I can't pin point which is my favorite because they're all just different.  Only sad part is they don't have any oysters in the menu.  :(  What's awesome about this spot is the different flavor sake.  i didn't realize there were so many different kinds.  I found my favorite to be Pineapple.  mmmm... yummy."}
{"text":"Attended yesterday after work and enjoyed happy hour, I had the Berry sangria with Sake and the California roll. I like that they served the Sake traditionally warm as well. The sushi was good nice and fresh, and the bartender was friendly. Its smaller but a nice intimate setting, bathroom could have been a little cleaner but all in all I would return for the Sake and of course the sushi"}
{"text":"After stopping in at La Bocca and Z Tejas for a drink and appetizer, my husband, sister (who was in town for the weekend), and I decided to stop at Ra for a few sushi dishes and drinks. We sat at a high table in the bar area. Our server was friendly enough at first, although, as I'll explain below, she turned out to be really rude and unprofessional. The music was definitely loud, but I do think that the atmosphere here is great if you're in the mood to be out and about and around a lot of people. I wouldn't choose it for a romantic, conversation-focused outing, but it's not a bad place to take an out-of-town guest for a night out or to have an energetic night with friends.   Since I was driving, I just had water. My husband and my sister ordered 2 of the specialty cocktails, which came quickly enough but were ridiculously sweet and weak. If you like drinks with some substance to them, I'd suggest ordered a regular mixed drink and not one of their specialty drinks, even if the cheesy names like \"Effen It In the Raw\" call out to you. For food, we ordered the lobster spring rolls, crispy spicy tuna roll, and the yellowtail sashimi. The fish was definitely fresh, but the portions were ridiculously small. The lobster spring rolls were actually really good, and you get a decent amount of lobster meat for the price ($9.75).   We were planning to go to Final Round (a bar in South Tempe that has karaoke on Fridays and Saturdays) after, so we were thinking about leaving after we finished our appetizers, but my sister was still hungry, so we asked our server if we could take another look at the menu. She brought us the menu, but we quickly realized that we were full, so we told her that we were ready for the check. She all of a sudden got an attitude and just snatched the menu and walked away. We were sitting in the bar area precisely because we weren't planning on ordering a lot, and we didn't appreciate her attitude.   We paid and left, but my sister then realized that she might have left her debit card in the check presenter. When she went back to look, the hostess was really ditzy and rude about it and didn't even offer proactively to talk to our server about the card. My sister had to ask her if she could go find our server to help us. When my sister asked our server if she had seen it, she was really rude and snapped that she hadn't seen it. My sister asked nicely if the server could take a look in the check presenters, and instead of being helpful and kind in a situation that was obviously stressful, she stomped over, grabbed the check presenter with our check copy inside and shook it out, stating \"See? It's not here!\" I understand that a restaurant like Ra is busy on a Friday night, but that didn't excuse rude or snappy service with an attitude, especially when it came to something serious.   Decent sushi and appetizers and fun atmosphere weigh in Ra's favor. Small portions, sickeningly sweet drinks, and full-of-it service send its rating right back down to 3 stars."}
{"text":"I went back again with a friend thinking things might be different.  Uhmmm yea so we got a table towards the back and within 5 minutes or so there was this AWFUL smell that filled the back half of the restaurant - like sewage or rotten fish... I don't know what it was, but we had to move tables because it was so bad. As of now I think I've given them enough chances! I won't be back!"}
{"text":"This is my girlfriend's favorite sushi spot. She loves their Hot Meso Soup. They have great Salmon here I'll give them that. I just think their sushi rolls are a little skimped. They look like mini sushi lol"}
{"text":"I go to RA about every other week and the food is great! But, this trip I tried something new and got the Chinese chicken salad and I took two bites and that was enough. I love the bento boxes! When you get a bento box it comes with a small garden salad with this ginger sweet and tangy dressing. This salad a completely different taste. The reason I'm still giving RA a 4 star is the level of service and the atmosphere. Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Trendy, Current, and a young 20s crowd. You know its trendy when you see all the waitress' in black fish net tights and short black dresses.   You dine while they play a great music selection with lights all over! Its like eating at a lounge right before the place turns into a night club. Very city-like.   Come for Happy hour!! I came here with 3 other classmates: Angela, Julie, and Natalie. When they said happy hour for sushi, I was thinking a low key place that was A-OK. I was completely wrong. This place is trendy and hip, which is unlike the suburbia of Mesa.   During happy hour, my friend and I split the Calamari, Calamari Sushi Roll, chicken wings (6 pieces) and a Margarita, and it came out to $22. Not bad! I like the ambiance, and its definitely something I will be coming back to!"}
{"text":"The Las Vegas roll seriously looks like LAS VEGAS.  Too many things going on all at once... from cream cheese to like this cookie looking thing topping off the roll on each piece. Its like a crown of some sort. Anywho, my friend loved it and thus she ordered it and I tried a piece. I am more of a traditional sushi lover... I like to go raw and add that wasabi on top.  Also.. I prefer a veggie sushi roll along with some sashimi on the side. Fresh cuts were delicious, staff and waiter were super cool and attentive. I will definitely go back next time I'm in town. Prices were also respectful if you're on budget."}
{"text":"Came here for my belated birthday celebration in our bar-hopping night on and off the Strip. My friends have been raving about their happy hour which inspired me to check out Ra. Happy hour ends at 7 pm and we arrived about 10-15 minutes before that. I wanted a table but the place was full, so we sat at the bar- our fault for getting there late on a Saturday, I know. The bartenders were nice and even though we barely got there in time and probably ordered just as happy hour was ending, they didn't make a fuss about it and we still got the hh prices. Also I got a complimentary birthday drink. I really can't remember what it was (I am a hard alcohol and mixed drinks noob) but it was so good. It was supposed to be a birthday shot but they gave me just about 1/3 of a glass, so there's customer appreciation right there.  The happy hour menu has a small but ok selection for drinks, but is definitely limited for sushi. I ordered some half price sushi as well as full price. I've been enjoying sushi for a long time and while not an expert, I think I know good sushi. The quality of the sushi itself is mediocre. It's not a health hazard but the rolls did fall apart a handful of times and were definitely in the bottom half of what I've tasted. It was not bad but just ok. Their sushi is way overpriced especially for what is it (poorly constructed with small cuts) so I would not come here to get full on sushi, but just for a snack or small meal during hh. I'm usually not a big fan of the California roll but it was good here, despite the small portions. My drink was some kind of tropical punch with tequila (sorry, I said I really am a noob) and it was very good. I felt the $5 it cost was not robbery. To add, the time it took for our rolls to come was very appropriate considering they seemed pretty busy.  For a drink, a free drink and small meal (I think 3 rolls) I spent $19 including tip which is nothing to complain about. Luckily I was not that hungry that their small portions could really bother me, but I had a good experience there with my friends and liked the set up of the bar and especially the good service. Not-bad-but-not-great sushi and high prices will limit my appearances here but it's a good place to snack and hang out with people. I look forward to getting to know their happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Average food, average service but great location. We stopped in for a drinks and apps to kill time before meeting people for dinner. We had to 2 beers, goyza and yellowtail in ponzul."}
{"text":"This place gave my friend food poisoning. Ruined the night. Plus the sushi itself from this place is not that great. Just go over to China town people!"}
{"text":"Spicy chicken teriyaki udon wasn't that bad considering I don't like thick udon noodles much.  The chicken and teriyaki sauce went well together and I always enjoy eating stir fry veggies.  I've eaten here before, and I'll be opting for sushi next time around..."}
{"text":"Nice outside seating. Friendly staff. Tuna roll didn't taste that good but the garlic edamame stole the snow. I'd go back for that over & over again!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful! Not only was the sushi innovative and delicious, the cocktails were refreshing and the service was very good.  We paced ourselves: starting with the seasonal special watermelon Shrimp roll, we then moved ont to the Pacific Roll and the Lobster Salmon roll. All were delicious with creative flavor combinations that worked well together.  This was an outstanding dining experience that inspires me to find reasons to return to Phoenix soon!"}
{"text":"I go there because I like the tuna and Pacific Rim Riesling. Staff is ok and the music is good but really loud."}
{"text":"The girls that work here have horrible attitudes, the sushi presentation is awesome but the flavor and freshness is seriously lacking. The bathrooms were filthy, one of the urinals was broken and covered with a black trash bag and there was piss all over the floor. I came here with a group from training and it was so loud we couldn't hear each other unless we yelled. We all agreed this is one of the worst sushi places we have been to.  -Over the two weeks I was in Scottsdale I ended up going to STINGRAY SUSHI about 5 times because the service is better, and the sushi options and freshness is way better. The girls are prettier too."}
{"text":"I never miss Happy Hour at RA every time I am in Vegas....the best! Excellent food and excellent prices. If only there was one in Alaska..I would be there daily. Very friendly service also. Best Tempura Calamari and Salmon Carpaccio ever"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Happy Hour locations.  Admittedly, i've never eaten there, not during happy hour.  The Happy Hour sushi menu is great for me, a non-sophisticated sushi eater.  Hot sake is a good deal too."}
{"text":"Went to RA last night and I was very impressed!! I am a recent convert to sushi and the two rolls I got were so good. I highly recommend the tootsy maki and the philadelphia roll. The service were super quick and they were pretty quick at refillings our drinks. The only thing I don't like about RA is that the music inside the resturant was way too loud. It was hard for me to hear what my friend was saying two seats away from me. So if you have a big group and want to be apart the conversation I would recommend sitting outside. Besides that, I loved it!"}
{"text":"For Vegas, this was about as good a sushi place as you could expect. It met my expectations and thus gets a 5-star review from me.  The ambiance was nice, and what you would expect from a moderately upscale sushi place, with dark wood, bright paper lanterns, and a variety of music at a decent volume.  My group of 8 wandered in on a Saturday afternoon (4-5 PM) and was seated instantly, with no problem. The server waited until all of us trickled in before taking orders, but not before getting us water. Since we came in at a good time, we were able to order from the happy hour menu, which had decent (for Vegas) pricing on rolls and sake.   I had an order of hot sake and ate my fill of tuna, salmon, yellow tail, and a few mixed rolls I ate for fun, though I'm sure the sushi chef rolled his eyes at all the rainbow rolls we ordered. The fish tasted fresh and was delicious, with fatty cuts of tuna and excellently-made sticky rice.  Nobody in my party had any complaints. This was a great way to start off a fun night in Vegas. I'd come back again."}
{"text":"Best happy hour ever, and I have never had a bad experience with the sushi or entrees. Prices are pretty good and it's a cool date spot or just hanging with friends!"}
{"text":"Delicious sushi and good happy hour prices!"}
{"text":"I frequent this restaurant for happy hour because prices are decent and the discounts last until 7pm, which is nice and unlike the majority of restaurants in the area. Service is usually mediocre, but I return regardless because I do like the food. Last night, however, was exceptionally terrible and I will reconsider spending my money at this establishment. A friend and I went in for dinner (HH) and after we were sat at a table had to wait for over 10 minutes for our server to come by. The restaurant was not full by any means, but having worked in the industry for several years I try to be understanding and assumed our server got caught up with her other tables. When she did finally stop at our table - we weren't greeted with a \"welcome\" or even \"hello\", instead she just walked up and literally said, \"Have you decided what you want to drink yet?\" My friend and I were both caught off guard. That was the last time we saw our server until we stopped her as she walked by and to ask for the check (we had waited so long we were ready to order our food by the time she asked about drinks). All of our drinks and food were dropped off by other servers or the busser (who was probably the most attentive). She didn't come by to ask how our food turned out, or even if we wanted another drink. If she had, we would've likely ordered another round. The only time she smiled or seemed even halfway engaged with us was as she dropped off the check. It's incredibly disappointing and certainly not the way I wanted to start off my Friday night. I left irritated and, like I said, will choose other options in the future in the hopes of a more pleasant experience."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend the waiter we got was new and said I could get the bento box so I ordered it. But then a different dish came out and when I asked where the bento box was they o sorry that ends at lunch. So I guess they just picked the closest thing to what I wanted...never had that happen to me before at least someone could have asked me what I wanted instead."}
{"text":"Was in town for the weekend and my friends and I decided to come in here for lunch yesterday before our flight! Loved the happy hour. Great food and great service. It is located inside of the fashion show mall!  We ordered a yellow tail roll and another rolled with crab. It was cooked but I forgot the name of it. The spicy garlic edamame was bomb as well!!! Def stopping by next time im in town!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour!! Great time to bring the kids too. Also mojitos are good too!"}
{"text":"Just came to town and This was the only restaurant open on Christmas Day so stopped in for dinner. They had happy hour all day. The food, service, and atmosphere were all really good. So glad we came. A perfect way to spend Christmas."}
{"text":"Of all the sushi I have eaten, RA is perhaps my favorite. The sushi selection is very entertaining and appears to be very diverse in choices. I would highly recommend the Las Vegas roll if you want to try something with a nice texture with a little bit of heat following. I had friends from Japan with us and was unsure if they would like RA. However, the agreed that the sushi was excellent and presentation deserved high marks.   Oh, try dessert afterwards. Very good selection."}
{"text":"Great service, great food.  I highly recommended it.  I was scared being in the mall in the strip, I thought for sure it would be overpriced.."}
{"text":"I'm not a frequent Yelp user, however this is best resource I can think of to share my experience with Rich, who is the manager of Ra-off of Mill Avenue.  I called into Ra for a pick up order at 5:23pm (I checked my phone log and later had to prove my call to the manager) for 2 Rolls & Edamame- the girl who helped me quoted 30 minutes until my food was ready.  When I arrived she told me they needed about another ten minutes- she offered to give me a call once it was prepared (which was nice of her to offer, too bad it didn't happen) After waiting back in my car for 10-15 minutes I still hadn't received a call, I walked back in to Ra and asked to speak with the manager.  Rich came out and introduced himself and I explained that I was still waiting on my food and it had been 50 minutes now (For two rolls!? Come on!! One was a California Roll!) He left to check on it, a minute later the hostess returned with my food.  Rich returned and said, \"oh good you got your food\" I said, yes I did, however it took over 50 minutes.  Rich responds with, \"well what do you want me to do\" (Isn't it management's role to ensure customers receive good service?)  I called in my food at 5:23pm (mind you, the receipt shown to me by Rich was time-stamped with the receipt print out time of 5:38pm) I then showed Rich my Call Log of when I called Ra.  He left me and proceeded to check several of his computers and returned saying, \"your clock runs fast, the food only took 28 minutes to come out and weren't you told it would take 30 minutes\" (I HAVE ATT'S iPHONE 5S, which provides time from a satellite) - I said, \"you are insinuating that the ATT network can't keep time and NOT that the hostess rang in my food late?  Regardless I called Ra at 5:23pm and the food came out at 6:13\" (Again, not a sorry.. not a- oh my, we were so slammed- which, important side note, THEY WERE FAR FROM SLAMMED)... he was just blaming ATT for providing me with a cell phone clock that runs fast and can't keep time.  (What an incredibly stupid thing to say) Luckily for him- I had a long day at work, as a property manager for 430 apartments (Safe to say I know when I am being treated with a lack of customer service as, customer service is what I do- day in and day out) so I just stopped reaching for an apology or waiting for him to offer anything that might improve my experience, he left with my receipts and gave me a credit of about $4.50   I guess moral of the story, Rich takes no pride in ensuring timely service with a friendly attitude, he'd rather blame the customer- hopefully your manager reads this Rich and can offer you some training in customer service since restaurants need that to thrive- surely negative online reviews can't be beneficial."}
{"text":"It has been a long time since I have had this bad of a meal.   I absolutely love sushi and am usually willing to give most places a try. Ra seemed promising...it was full of people, dimly lit, bumpin top 40 tunes. I was by myself and requested to sit at the sushi bar. I figured that it would surely be faster to sit at the bar then a table...boy was I wrong.   When I gave the sushi chef my menu of selections, he informed me that it would be at least 30 minutes before I got my first order. What?!?! Yes, the place was kind of busy, but not packed, and there were at least 4 sushi chefs behind the counter.  So I figured that I would order some miso soup and vegetable tempura appetizer to kill some time. The soup was good, kind of hard to screw that up. The tempura on the other hand, left a lot to be desired. They gave me about 10 pieces, 8 of which were asparagus and broccoli. Come on! I want some sweet potato, regular potato, green beans....anything but a plate of broccoli! Broccoli never tempura's well because the batter gets in the crevices and never really cooks, but stays raw. Utterly disgusting. The tempura dipping sauce had absolutely no flavor at all and added nothing to the flavor of the dish.   About 30-minutes later and on cue, my sushi began to filter in. First I was given my rainbow roll. The diameter of this roll was a little larger than the size of a quarter. It was cut into 8 pieces and consumed in about 20 seconds. Next, I was given my tuna. The tuna was mushy and the rice fell apart on almost every piece. I am no sushi virgin and know full well how to use chop sticks...this rice was horrible. 10 minutes later I was given my yellowtail. Again, it was mushy and the rice fell apart. Some time later my salmon arrived and it was the same story. I had to ask for ginger and wasabi, as they were not just provided to me.   I saw my server maybe twice and not only did my glass of water sit empty for nearly 20 minutes at a time, but my plates began to stack up next to me.   The sushi chef wouldn't even give patrons the time of day and seemed as though we were bugging him every time we wished to place an order. Look, at nearly $6.00  for two pieces of tuna sushi, the food better be pristine! And the service impeccable!   The menu comes with a disclaimer that good sushi takes a while to prepare, so if you can't wait, then you basically should leave. Um, no. Good sushi does not take 30-minutes to prepare. Sushi was designed to be Japanese fast food, analogous to the western European sandwich. If you are going to pose as a sushi elitist restaurant, then at least go all the way. I expect to not have wooden chop sticks that splinter and I would like my sushi to be served in the correct order, from light fish to dark.   All in all, the service sucked and the food was blah. I'm done with this rant. That's how much I hate this place. If no star was an option, I would have picked that!"}
{"text":"This was my first attempt at a Sushi restaraunt.  I have been to plenty of places that serve sushi, but not as their specialty.  Ra was really not much better, and the service was...OK.  There seemed to be plenty of people in there having a good time, and I did enjoy the food, but would rather go somewhere I could hold a conversation if I am going to spend $40 on a couple meals."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good, food is always pretty good and the service is okay. I have eaten at this location numerous times and the service is usually on point but today, it's a bit mixed. 2 stars because the food is good........   Now moving on to the bad. I have two people I'd like to talk about. Our server, didn't get a name but was a younger blonde, great service and super friendly. Another server that brought food out for her, not so nice, in the food industry customer service is everything. If you are going to bring food out, make sure you have an available hand in case you need to move stuff or pick something up. Don't bark at us to \"move your plate\" in a rude tone and add please at the end to make it sound better. It is not our fault that you aren't prepared and the fact that we were not fast enough to move our stuff before you could bark at us is rude and unnecessary.   This ruined the rest of our meal and after that she was rude and just gawking at the table the rest of our time there. Not much of a ranter but this was pretty disappointing"}
{"text":"Ew.  Thats a compliment, too.  I don't want syrup in my martini and I've had better sushi from the grocery store.  I'd rather stay home."}
{"text":"When I first started frequenting this place's Sunday night happy hour, I loved it.  I would go with a group of friends, and it was always a great time.  Over the last few months, I have seen a decline in the quality of food, service, and an increase in prices.  Happy hour is still pretty decent prices, and the food hasn't been bad, it just isn't as good as it used to be, unfortunate really."}
{"text":"Got the chirashi bowl and happy hour menu was okay.. They didn't have a lot to choose from but overall was great! Fresh sushi and service was awesome!"}
{"text":"I liked this place. The reviews show low stars but I liked it. I was there for happy hour so go at that time. The pricing is good. I don't know about dinner, but happy hour is cool.  Servers were chill.  Host was a bit stuck up. Not sure why she though she was that great. But the place is cool. I recommend people check it out if they want to try a sushi place on the Mill ave when you are in town visiting Tempe."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Absolutely amazing drinks, attentive wait staff, nicely priced food, and quick service. There's always a manager to be seen, I talked to one of the managers (James) Who came by to take some dishes off of the table and ask us how our meal was. He was knowledgeable and professional. You can modify pretty much any roll or entree. This restaurant doesn't only serve sushi, it has things like chicken or beef teriyaki, yakisoba, Udon, and all kinds of delicious appetizers. The clam udon and scallop dynamite roll are amazing! Perhaps the best thing about RA is there happy hour, from 3 to 7 and 10 to close. their bar is fun and has a great atmosphere. Their lunch specials are fantastic as well. If you are a more experienced sushi eater, they have sea urchin, toro, octopus. As you can probably tell, I come here all the time. Overall, this is just a really great place for any time of the day."}
{"text":"Nice and roomy with a good selection and very good service.  The seafood was fresh and tasty and a meal is reasonably priced for a sushi dinner with a beer or two.  A good find in a town where every meal is pricey."}
{"text":"So from 3-7pm Monday's- Saturday's, I'm freakin in love with this place!  Yes, that's during happy hour.  This place is amazing for happy hour.  I can't speak for any other times during the day.  =)"}
{"text":"Fantastic place ok maybe because it was our first real date here ;) memories of love romance and bliss ! So the Sushi is great and the drinks ok but lovely and fantastic service . Ambiance and streetside dining a plus too for a nice day"}
{"text":"I'm definitely stretching to give this place the 4 star entirely on the crazy red globes hanging from the ceiling and the slamming soundtrack that is pumped in there. I wouldn't do that if I thought the food was crap (because it wasn't), however: I completely don't get why you'd want to eat sushi in what is essentially a dance club environment. Or why you'd want to eat anything when the urge to groove is much higher than the urge to consume sushified things.   As you can see from the other reviews, the panning of the clientele and possibly the food (although I thought it was pretty good) might make you not want to search for this place, particularly since it's sushi. However, since it's summer in Scottsdale now, there's a lot of the regular crowd gone, and the place was pretty empty when we were in there.  So ask yourself: do you want to jump around in your seat while you slam sake and fish? If the answer is \"nein\", then perhaps go elsewhere.   (btw, that tv over the bar showing sports stuff is so out of place in this environment I don't see how it hasn't slunk off on its own)."}
{"text":"One of the worse visits I have had here. The tables and booths were clean for the most part but service was not up to par. Service was very slow with very few customers. Forgot to make rice for my teriyaki bowl. Also forgot many items that came with my family and I's meal. Our waitress kept bringing out full drinks before our drinks were even finished out of pure laziness.. Won't be back"}
{"text":"Liked this place!"}
{"text":"Seems everyone has a strong opinion 'bout this place.  AND SO DO I!!!!  I have been to Ra a few times, and only one out of few times was it subtle and quiet.  So to start, this is not a quiet traditional sit down sushi bar.  This is a trendy pop sushi fest.  The decor is nice and.....red. Great date color.  Add a few hot bottles of $1 dollar sake at Happy Hour and you can pretty much land a sure thing.  No, the rolls aren't awesome, but, at Happy Hour you and your friends can get a table full rolls that ain't half bad.  They also have flavored sake....such as Mango or Apple. (way too sweet for my taste)  The night to go is Sunday, which is Service Industry Appreciation Night.    Order your cheap rolls and shout over 80's hits spun by live DJ.  It's fun."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Ra. The sushi is always on point and the staff is nice. The only thing that's a little annoying is the price of sushi; simple and traditional rolls are marked up, but hags my only complaint."}
{"text":"Solid Saturday night out in Scottsdale. Kicker off my birthday night with some good sushi. Everything was timely, clean, and well prepared. The entire staff was accommodating  and constantly checked on us even though we were outside. Our waiter was funny, professional, and knew my friends perfume by scent which is pretty cool lol. Solid night so far!"}
{"text":"Normally I am never on this side of town. I was in the complex and absolutely starving and pleasantly surprised that  RA are opens at 11 a.m!!    I ordered the blueberry watermelon Martini to start, very crisp and refreshing. I don't know why but I decided to try a different martini and went with the mango. A little bit disappointed here,  the mango flavor was very faint and bitter, I was expecting more of an overpowering sweet flavor. Definitely wouldn't  order the mango margarita again.  I ordered two entrees. The first one was the tuna salad off of the lunch menu. I was a little hesitant at first but happy with the outcome. For only $7.90 it was a steal. The saled had seared ahi tuna with albacore tuna. The tataki and garlic panzu sause woken tast busds I never even know I had. The flavor was  literally explosive. The earthy greens, tuna and sauteed cashews gave the saled a fresh and crisp tast. No joke I think this is the best salad I have ever had in my life  I also ordered the crazy monkey rolls. Rolls come with smoked salmon, mango and cream cheese rolled and talk with avocados red tempora bites and sauteed cashews drizzled with mango and Spiel sauce I also got the spicy mayo and jalapeno smoked Mayo on the side.   When I got my order our there was no spicky mayo. When I took my first bite of the crazy money till I was extremely disappoint. With the description smoke salmon  I was expecting a smoky flavor however this is not the case at all. The role had a very overpowering fishy taste. Very distasteful. I also thought there would be a lot more cream cheese and they're all there was barely even a sliver. I will definitely never her order this roll again.  Know for the services. I'm a little hesitant about this one. My server was very fast but not friendly. Being 11am the place was dead and I expected a little more friendliness. When I had questions about CERN rolls instead of answering my question I was redirected to certain areas of the money. I personally thought this is a little bit unnecessary. Throughout my dining experience which was about an hour and a half not once was I asked how I was doing or if I like my food, to me this is absolutely unacceptable especially with our a being and nicer establishment. I would expect this kind of service from my local burger shop not 'Re. If my server bothered asking me a how i was doing she would know that i was not satisfied with what I orders.   For paying $51.8p I really do expect a lot more. Even have to stop at another employee to pay my tab.  Needles to say I will not be coming back to this location. Bummer to i just got a job in the complex and though this was going to be my go to spot for lunch.   Good things there is so many options in this area. But seriously I would talk to your bartender. Although she was not rude whatsoever and the food came out that fast which I appreciate. I just felt like I was an inconvenience and that I was bothering her anytime I ask for something.   For being the only Patron in the bar for the last half-hour there was no reason for her not to ask me how I'm doing and if I like my food ext, ridiculous. I guess only certain type of customers matter. But on the flip sise I am more quiet reserved type of person so I won't address an issue unless I'm asked how I like my food and how my dining experience was. But nevertheless I don't think is okeay to ignore your customer for over 1hr and a half."}
{"text":"Eating in Las Vegas can be pricey... But, it doesn't have to be if you know where to go. I highly suggest hitting RA during their HAPPY HOUR. Great prices on a good selection of sushi, rolls, cocktails, sake and beer.  RA is a chain found of sushi bars found in 7 States with 25 locations. I am familiar with RA from my local RA located in Huntington Beach.  The restaurants are all decorated about the same... Large red \"Chinese lantern inspired\" glass orbs (dim) lighting mixed with simple, but tasteful traditional Japanese/Asian decor. It is not a traditional Japanese sushi restaurant, but sometimes that is okay.  The service is good, considering how crazy busy this place gets... But, most importantly... The sushi is consistently fresh and tasty. Don't be fooled by the fact that this restaurant is located at the Fashion Show Mall, this is definitely not a \"food-court\" experience. The decor may not be as flashy and preparation may not be as fancy as the upscale sushi bars found in the nearby hotels, but the fish is as fresh at half  the price. A good value if you are in need of a sushi fix."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Their lunch special is a good deal for a bento box that will satisfy you.  The people who work there are very helpful and patient with you."}
{"text":"Happy hour drink and appetizer food and service was very good! As locals we will be back. Atmosphere was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour from 3-7pm which saved the day.  I was starving so I got: +Veggie roll - large pieces, so prepare yourself for the cut roll, but crunchy and fresh +Pineapple wontons - so FRIGGIN DELICIOUS. it was pineapple and cream cheese in triangle wontons with this delicious sauce that was like pineapple sauce (apple sauce sorta) +edamame - a bit oversalted for my taste, but good +avocado roll - the seaweed was a little tough  And they had my favorite drink - KNOB CREEK, whoohoo!  Only thing that was annoying to me is that there are only TVs in the bar, so I couldnt see them when we were seated. =("}
{"text":"Love coming to RA especially on Tuesday for their awesome lunch special deals where it's buy 1 get 1 lunch free . Great for corporate lunches, or a fun date, or girls night!"}
{"text":"Crappy sushi, and our server was overwhelmed and took way too long to get our drinks, miso soup, and edamame.  (10 minutes for the drinks, then another 10 for the soup, then another 5 minutes for the edamame). Plus, the ambiance inside was awful-  the red lights are retarded, seriously, get some new lighting.  The loud club music was pretty annoying as well. If you have any taste for sushi, you're not going to find it for a good price in Vegas.  Either don't go out, or go to a $$$$.  This place is for middle-American tourists and high school kids. -Oh, the worst hot sake I've ever ingested."}
{"text":"Sophia is the Absolute BEST server I have ever met. Such an incredible young lady. She's excellent at her job but she is able to relate to everyone she serves. She is genuine but adapts to meet the needs and personalities of her customers.   This is a gift that can't be learned!! She is on a path to management and huge success."}
{"text":"RA RA OHH LA LA! Love this place but only been here for happy hour. My friends and I usually come here to pre-game before we go out to the clubs on sunday night. The sake is $2 and the beers $3-6 pending on what beer you get.  The food wil run you $2-$7 pending i what you order but there happy hour food selection has very good deals. There are plenty of rolls you can choose from and appetizers. The music here on sundays nights is always GREAT! I always find a GOOD new song that i hear when im at RA sushi. To me a tru happy hour gem. After the cheap saki / beer / and happy hour foods / plus the music getting is pumped up.... YOU will be all set to go out to the clubs with you tummy satisfied and ur head buzzzzed! Leggggoooo!"}
{"text":"This is hard to rate because we have regular customers since we moved here 4 years ago.  Happy is great and food i good.  We came in just before 5:00 PM which is later than normal.  The bartender was very nice and took our order right away.  We always sit at the bar but this time the music was so loud it was difficult to hold a conversation.  We asked Laurel if they could please turn down the music.  It didn't happen.  When our food arrived we asked again.  Her comment was that is the normal volume for that time of day.  Again it did not get turned down.  She suggested that my handicapped husband who is paralyzed on one side, walks with a cane and struggles to get on a bar stool, to move to the middle of the bar as we were right under the speaker.  Really?  As we were eating, another couple came in (which make a total of 11 people in the entire restaurant) and when she took their order, she had to cup her ear in order to hear them.  The manager, Miguel, spent most of his time talking to the bartenders and the hostesses.  He never bothered to come by and explain why they would not turn down the music.  Our request was flat out ignored.  Normally we spend at a least two hours and order more drinks.  We stayed 40 minutes.  Since nobody would tell us why they would not turn down the music, my husband limped over to the manager and asked why after two requests, why they could not turn down the music.  His response??  Sorry, it's company policy. If it is, why could you or your staff not told us?  Why did we have to find you?  Unacceptable customer service"}
{"text":"Who runs out if edamame at a sushi bar?  And on a Monday night?  Server didn't know  much about sushi. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I only come here for their Happy hour. They have a great Happy hr. They have a RA sushi in Vegas as well... I hit that happy hour up too. lol! They are one of the rare places that has happy hr on the weekend. Service and food is overall good."}
{"text":"Had an amazing sushi dinner tonight at RA in old town.  There was rowdy table sitting behind us, but Eric one of the managers totally took care of us.  He diffused the situation immediately and sent us on our merry way with appetizer coupons :) thanks RA you guys rock!"}
{"text":"Unless you come here for Happy Hour I'd say this place is over priced. My friends and I used to come here for reverse Happy Hour on the regular for drinks and appetizers. Unfortunately, corporate did away with it. Which i think was probably a pretty horrible business choice considering there are a million other places to go to on Mill, which is exactly what we did when we found this out."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying their Sushi is really good and as fresh as it gets.  The prices are little higher then most mom and pop sushi spots but you get what you pay for.  The service I received was exceptional. Our waiter was pretty prompt and got our orders in and the food took about 10-15 mins to come out which is fine. Our waiter also came and checked on us periodically to fill waters and ask if we needed anything else.   I recommend The Lobster Roll, The Vegas Roll, and The Chili Ponzu Yellowtail roll. One word, Exquisite! Other then that, the rest of the rolls were delightful. Also, recommend coming around happy hour time to save money. Cheers!"}
{"text":"They have a good happy hour and some very good rolls. Sake Bomber, Viva Las Vegas Roll and the Crazy Monkey rolls are my staples here. The ambiance is trendy and hip. Bar side is always a bit loud,if you want a conversation, try the resurant side."}
{"text":"My mom, boyfriend and I went in for happy hour while we were on this side of town, and had a great experience. We were able to sample all sorts of stuff and for a fair price.   The best part was Isaac, our bartender. He was not only knowledgable about the drinks he was making, but he was friendly, and we had good conversation.   Being a bartender myself, I know how frustrating the \"verbal tip\" can be. When someone tells you how well you're doing and doesn't let management of any sort know. So, even though the food was amazing, Isaac is the real reason behind this post. Keep up the good work, and thank you for the wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"The service was the worst. It took us 10 minutes to get seated and it wasn't even rush hour. We then were seated and it took our waitress 15 minutes to get our drinks & give us a menu. As we ordered the food we were forgot about and our food didn't come for 35 more minutes. Yes, that's an hour without food. Then we stopped the manager and he took care of us. As our sour waitress came back to give us our refills she put salt on the rims of our strawberry lemonade instead of sugar. This was the last straw. We then ate all the food and spoke with the manager about the terrible service.  The only reason this has a star is because the food was good."}
{"text":"We go to this location a few times a month and it is always excellent. Sashimi assortment is always fresh..good miso soup.. service is fast. Recommended."}
{"text":"Have had their food before and was very good. Have to comment on the service from the get go. Unfortunately tried going in today and waiting over ten minutes before leaving with no one getting my name for a table or seating me. Now, I would normally have no problem waiting, but being pretty pregnant and with sore feet it was a bit frustrating. Additionally a staff member did walk by and said someone would be by... That didn't happen and there are other good restaurants near by so we walked out. Hopefully it's better next time guys..."}
{"text":"Awesome place. We stopped in for the 3pm-7pm happy hour, from entering with the hostess to the perfect balance of personality and professionalism from Patrick.   You came here to drink so here's the details...$3 hot sake (not a typo $3 on the strip) and the most expensive to on the HH menu was $9.   Just go already and if you miss the first HH another starts at 10."}
{"text":"Plus: Food is inexpensive during lunch and taste pretty good.  Cons: It might be a bit hard to find if you're not familiar with Fashion Show Mall. Kind of slow (but friendly though!) service even though the place wasn't busy.  My boyfriend and I went here to grab a quick bite while avoiding overeating (and starving) since we had plans to have a BBQ at home with my parents.  We ended up sharing a bento box and a few pieces of nigiri sushi. Bento was teriyaki chicken and I judge a place on how well they can make an easy dish (because, seriously, how can anyone screw that up?)   Thankfully chicken was right. I couldn't eat the gyozas because they had pork in them. :( If I recall correctly you can't substitute either so that was a bummer for me.  We'll probably return here again since it's a lot better than the Japanese place located in the food court."}
{"text":"RA is like a beautiful woman you see walking down the street, initially stunning, but as soon as she opens her mouth you realize she's ugly on the inside. Yes, RA sets a posh vibe, sensual vibe. We came during happy hour before a movie screening, and it was busy. I was excited about the happy hour. We ordered pineapple wontons, seared tuna, and crispy spicy tuna.  As soon as the food came, I was disappointed. The portions are so tiny! I'm glad we came during happy hour because I would never pay full price for the amount of food we ordered, which tasted alright at best.  Besides the ambience and service, I would've given it a three star rating BUT I'm not sure which dish it was, but I became extremely sick afterwards, running to the bathroom - twice! For that I have to acknowledge that I really can't return here and don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a few months but forgot to post about my last visit. All I can say is YUM! The Vegas roll is delicious and their yellowtail in garlic ponzu sauce is killer! Thank you RA!"}
{"text":"RA is slow, expensive, and only so-so on the actual sushi part of things. Rolls are not exactly loaded down, though most are of a decent size. The fish is fresh enough, but sometimes comes out a bit warmer than I'd like, and today, a very simple lunch order took over 1.5 hours. Not great when on lunch hour from work. I prefer Sakebombers down on McClintock and Broadway. It looks a little dumpy, but they pack the fish in, it's fresh and delicious, and priced right."}
{"text":"**Summary**        - Food - The food was average at best with the exception of the spicy sesame chicken wings.        - Ambiance - You're definitely paying for the hip/club feel at this place. Everyone there seemed to be dressed for a night on the town and it was only 6pm when we went.        - Price - The happy hour pricing seemed to me like what I'd pay regularly at other places for the same quality/portions. **Price**        - Happy Hour Mon-Sat from 3pm to 7pm. **Ordered**         - $3 Salmon Nigiri  - The salmon seemed like it was cut and left there for a while. It was completely dry by the time it got to the table.        - $5 Spicy Sesame Chicken Wings - The only thing we ordered that actually seemed worth it. You get about 6 tangy and delicious wings/drum sticks.        - $6 Rainbow Roll - The assorted fish on the roll was cut nearly paper thin.        - $7 Viva Las Vegas Roll - The roll was good, but for five pieces, it didn't seem very happy hourish to me. **Recommendations**        - I wouldn't recommend this place for the food. If you're coming here, it's probably for the ambiance."}
{"text":"Being hungry for sushi this was a good place for happy hour was great  the service was great I would go back again see the pictures below we had pokey and we had shrimp tempura rolls and we had calamari rolls and vegetarian rolls everything was good"}
{"text":"Found this place from Yelp! Mommy and I vacationed in Vegas over Spring Break and came here for dinner one night. It was pretty late, like almost 11 pm probably, but there were a few people inside and a dj. I'm not familiar with sushi...AT ALL, since I don't eat meat that often, but I think my mom ordered sashimi and she LOVED it. Anyways, we also ordered this appetizer which I cant seem to remember, but I want to say it was some sort of...well I dont know what they're called, like a crispy wonton thing. It was good nonetheless, but for some reason I dont remember what it was haha. Since I'm not a big fan of sushi, I decided to be American and order this noodle dish haha it was really gooood! Large portion too and we also ordered a chicken salad which was delicious and huge, as well. I took my noodle dish back to the hotel and stuck it in the mini fridge, it was so good, but the next day when we left Vegas, I forgot about it and left it there! :(  However, I just realized there is one back home in Califrnia right next to my house wow! I do not have any complaints about this place. Oh our waitress was also really nice and very attentive."}
{"text":"Half off sushi Happy Hour is the best. I got the Viva Vegas roll and it was so good and very beautiful. The tootsy maki roll was even better though. The crumbles make the perfect addition to a unfried roll. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Good place with a decent Happy hour.  Loud"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, prices were not bad for Vegas, service was fair. I might go back, but wouldn't go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"I have never thought about coming to RA before my friend told me about their happy hour. It runs from 3-7 on the weekdays. They have dishes from $2-$7 and drinks from $4-$8. The service was spectacular for what we were looking for. Our waitress came around to take orders, clear plates, and then read the cues as to when to leave us alone. We were able to study and eat at the same time.   The \"RA-cking\" Shrimp and the short ribs are the way to go. The shrimp comes in a generous portion, crisp on the outside, and tender on the inside. The dipping sauce is pure liquid crack. It goes well with everything. The rest of the items tend to be less imaginative or special.   I tend to be conflicted with the idea of happy hours at sushi restaurants. A part of me would rather just go to an AYCE restaurant and have a larger selection, but RA was a good option for a more quiet place to sit back."}
{"text":"i love this place.   but it is a good idea to be in the mood for really loud house, trip and electro if you plan on eating here."}
{"text":"Great happy hour deals! We usually come here for birthday events and sometimes to get my favor dish on the menu which is the Scallop dynamite roll. They also have a Scallop dynamite appetizer too for something a little lighter and smaller.  The Las Vegas roll is on point here and the Toosie Maki roll. They have good deals on Bento boxes from chicken teriyaki, shrimp tempura, vegetable tempura, etc.   Can't go wrong with pretty much anyone on the menu here."}
{"text":"The scallop dynamite roll is my favorite dish here!   Also the Toosi Maki roll and The Las Vegas Roll.   The happy hour is a great deal for more affordable sushi with friends or family.   Great for birthday celebrations or just a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"OVER PRICED AMERICANIZED SUSHI!  My boyfriend and I went here for dinner the other night and ordered an appetizer, 3 roles, and no drinks, our bill was $50.  Seems a little crazy to me.    The service was good and staff was friendly, but that can't make up for your tiny portions and over priced menu items.  Our $8 appetizer consisted of 4 wontons!?  Overall the food was good, and would recommend if you're not afraid of spending more than you should."}
{"text":"Love this place i had fun with my family and the service is Great all my facebook friends check it out."}
{"text":"Sushi is over priced. Service was very good, ambiance was nice BUT very disappointed that there is no changing station for kids!!"}
{"text":"I gave RA Sushi another chance after having a negative experience in a Tucson location and at this point, I think that I'm ready to cross it off my list completely. I came here for a birthday drink and snack (small order of sushi and dessert after having a meal elsewhere) and it didn't wow me by any means. The drink that I had was good, but that's pretty much it. I ordered a tuna nigiri (maguro) and the sushi order came out before any plates, chopsticks, or wasabi did so I had to sit there and wait for those to arrive before I could eat. When I was ready for dessert, I asked for an order of green tea ice cream and our waitress informed us that she would have to check if they have it, because they were out the previous day. Ten minutes go by without seeing our waitress, and I remind her that I had asked about the green tea ice cream. She apologizes, and five minutes later returns with it. This is a rather common theme throughout this experience at RA - the food is mediocre and the service is always lacking. Maybe the issue is that I prefer to sit in the bar area, which is open seating? Whatever the case, I think it'll be a little while before I return here."}
{"text":"This has been a great place for me.  Love where its located.  I have enjoyed the drinks, the service and the food.   My company has shared my opinion.  Never anything fishy, and everything has been good - and I've done some serious experimenting.  Presentation has always been good.  Like the lighting and feel of this place at night.  Favorite spot is seated at the sushi bar at the back of the restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it. Great service, great food! The calamari tempura was amazing!"}
{"text":"Service was slow and in attentive. We ordered the Sashimi dinner along with an eel roll, the food was decent but the roll lacked flavor. There are better choices in the area if you're looking for A sushi joint."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time when we stopped in for a quick lunch on Sunday. Overall had a great experience and some good food. We sat in the bar area which is open seating and were promptly greeted by our server / bartender, who ended up being awesome throughout the visit.   We started off with the Pineapple Wontons (4), which were packed with flavor--I could have eaten them all day. For our meal we split a Spicy Mango Roll, tuna nigiri and sweet egg. The roll was great and highly recommend it, but unfortunately the nigiri and sweet egg weren't anything special.   I give it a 4/5 because I've definitely had better nigiri and it's a little pricy. If you don't mind the price and aren't going for the nigiri, I highly recommend you stop in and check it out. We weren't there for happy hour, but looking at their menu, they've got a pretty solid happy hour selection."}
{"text":"The food was really good and good atmosphere. The only negative was the service. Our waiter came back and asked my boyfriend what he ordered like 3 times and then me and my sister had finished all of our food before they even brought out one of my boyfriends rolls.. so obvious that he forgot to put in half of our order!! when they did finally bring him out food, half of it wasn't even what he ordered. Server could not accept responsibility."}
{"text":"Do you know what is awesome? When you make a reservation, arrive on time an have to wait over 20 mins for your table. That is completely unacceptable and unprofessional. And if they tell me it will be just a few more minutes because \"the table is being cleaned\" I am going to call them out on their bullshit lie!!!"}
{"text":"Great sushi, good menu and generous portions. I am a regular when in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing Service!!!! Rob the Manager is the true definition of a manager and helping every person with their needs and wants!!!!"}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for a quick drink and sushi before a show.  Once again great and attentive service from the bartenders.  Ra was having a current special of edamame and 4 plates for $25.  Great deal that is going thru the end of March."}
{"text":"Better than average sushi. Vegas roll is excellent. I highly recommend going during happy hour if you want reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great food! Great wine! My kind of Friday happy hour. As always pineapple wontons and lobster rolls were awesome. Las Vegas roll was yummy too. Service was friendly and speedy. Actually quiet a few people already here. The coasters are cute too.. They say colder than your ex!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to a RA sushi in years but have always loved the ambiance and food. The service at every one of these restaurants I have been to has always been poor. Not that the staff is rude or unfriendly. They are always super nice and helpful but they just must be very understaffed or something. We came here for a few visits and each time it was difficult to find our waiter/waitress or the food took forever to come out. I have experienced this same issue at other RAs so I'm not sure what the deal is. Okay, enough of that. We literally came here every day of our trip since our hotel was nearby, it has good food and drinks and is a great people watching spot. You can sit on the patio and look out to Las Vegas Blvd so it's sort of like watching a movie. There are also TV's so we could watch the games we needed to see. We had the garlic edamame and the Monkey Roll. Both we loved. I love their unique rolls and the flavors they put together. I hope this chain sticks around because it is very good. All of the waiters/waitresses we had were so nice and friendly which also made our visits all good experiences."}
{"text":"Yummy!! This place is kinda pricey but its really good with great service.  They also have excellent cocktails!"}
{"text":"Food was great..and place looked beautiful. ....I would tell my friends to go here..it also has out doors area."}
{"text":"OH MY GOD AMAZING We had the mango lobster spring rolls, the eel cucumber roll, shrimp tempura roll, and my boyfriend had the Rock n Roll and one other that had guac on it and literally everything had me practically drooling. The atmosphere is really cool and the workers are friendly. (: Totally coming back. Oh and even two rolls are enough to fill you up- but you keep eating anyway because EVERYTHING IS SO FREAKING GOOD"}
{"text":"Huurrr RA for RA Sushi  Hip... rockin... and good food.  Ate here with some friends and business associate.  The sushi was decent/good, the other menu items were also both intriguing and delightful.    A nice selection of Saki's and beer.  Only complaints are 1.) as much as I like hip, when I feel like being hip, the music was too loud to hear the person across from me... as well he was playing all rasta beats... loud rasta music and sushi equals not so much good deal. 2.)  Sushi selection was lackluster, all the basics, but none of the best.  Definitely would recommend, if I go back and the same DJ is spinning I will probably come back and note this as 3 star rating rather then its current 4."}
{"text":"I'll preface this review by saying that I love Ra. They have a fantastic happy hour menu and their seared ahi tuna is the best thing ever!  That being said, I got a takeout seared tuna salad today and it was the WORST seared tuna I've ever had (see picture below). It's almost like since they knew it was to go they decided to use the worst quality fish because I wouldn't be there to complain or send it back (which I DEFINITELY would have).  I will never order takeout from them again. Try harder, Ra."}
{"text":"Coming from Arizona where RA is huge, I was quite disappointed with this location in Las Vegas.  First, the happy hour is the best which is on Monday thru Saturday 4-7 and then on Sunday from 8-11. Awesome sushi and drinks which are usually half off, but recently they have changed their happy hour menu. I've always had a great time coming here with friends for a quick bite while at Fashion Show, but the service the last  three times was extremely slow. Once, the girl forgot our cocktails but we asked about them after we received our food and the girl was clueless. It felt like years before the server came back to ask if we wanted anymore food or drinks, by then I was rather upset and got the check instead. Either RA needs to provide more staffing or figure out a way to make service move a bit faster.   Overall, I can't complain about this place. $2 Edamame and $5 Tootsie Maki rolls will eventually make me want to go back."}
{"text":"The three stars is for the fun vibe and the music.  I think the prices are overpriced if you are not visiting during happy hour.  The rolls I tasted here are not consistent in taste and sometimes sloppy and too much cream cheese but I would return for the RA\"CKIN' Shrimp and to enjoy a drink during HH only."}
{"text":"I LOVE THEIR WASABI MASHED POTATOES! HOLY CRAP IS IT GOOD!!!   Sushi is bomb. Excellent service. Damn 5 stars. SOOOOO GOOODDD. I WISH THERE WAS A RA SUSHI IN THE BAY AREA!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We ate there a few times when I was in Scottsdale for work for a year. The sushi is pretty good, nothing exceptional or to write home about. The place is always busy, and it's pretty confined.   To be really, brutally honest, it just wasn't that great, especially for the price."}
{"text":"My best friend felt like sushi so I recommended this place.  I had been here before and enjoyed it.  It was getting late also so this was the only place I could think of.  It was not very busy and sat at the bar.  We ordered the Viva Las Vegas roll which is the best ever.  There were also some people doing sake bombs so we decided we should try it too.:-)  We also had a tsunami punch which is yummy and strong.  They have a DJ in there so it makes it fun if you are in the mood to get your party started.  They also gave us the happy hour prices although we were a little early!"}
{"text":"Didn't enjoy the quality of the food. Could hear the servers behind the curtain being loud. The fish was not fresh and the light soy sauce wasn't on the table. Gum stuck under the Sushi counter grossed me out as I was feeling for a purse hook."}
{"text":"People seem to have a lot of bad things to say about this place but Im just not one of them. i do not eat Sushi so this review is based off other menu items. Rockin shrimp, pineapple wontons, garlic edamame, spicy green beans etc..oweeiii i am in heaven. Sake bombs and all this food around me i will leave one happy girl which i do every time. I give the servers major credit for keeping a smile on their faces. You get  mix crowd at this location...drunks, loud people, quiet people, couples etc...so you have to understand the servers here deal with  lot and i have no complaints about my service the times i have been.  I love sake and i love the apps here. Delicious."}
{"text":"We have been to this location a couple of times  and have received terrible service each time. Once seated it takes quite a bit of time to be acknowledged  by the waiter/waitress despite multiple staff passing by our table. A simple \"be be right with you\" would have sufficed.   The sushi is good, but the service not so much."}
{"text":"We came in on sept 10, sat in First booth, the left of the front door.  Normally we have good service, the food here is great but what happened today left a bad taste in out mouths.  Our server was unprofessional, grandma shirt, hair was messy. She Was really rude and walked away while we were ordering. We got our food, it's good but our waitress hardly every came by to check up on us. My friend waited 10minutes for a refill, then my other friend waited another 10min on top of that! She made it very clear that she didn't care. Then when we received our check, she circled in bold TIP 15%. I mean we believe if you received awesome service, then yeah u deserve that and maybe more, but knowing you gave us bad service and then expecting that, hahaha think again NOPE!   The food and ambiance is good, HOWEVER the service SUCKS! Because of this experience we won't be going back, NEVER AGAIN. And I'll make sure my friends know about this as well. And btw they got a 1star because of the food."}
{"text":"Okay....so I think the main reason people come here, the atmosphere!  It's a louder, more upbeat sushi bar....a little more swanky and the decor a little more modern, since it is on the strip.  So for ambiance, especially for a bachelorette party...I think it fits the bill.  The food however is not good for the price you are paying.  I ordered the sesame garlic chicken wings...and it was just salty on the outside without any real flavor to the chicken and most chicken wings have a nice crunch on the outside.  I also ordered the sashimi dinner combo with tuna/albacore/salmon/yellowtail.  While the portion is decent....the fish is not fresh....it was hard to eat the tuna/albacore/yellowtail because of how fishy it tasted.  The salmon was decent, but again there is definitely better sushi just down the road on spring mountain.  They do have happy hour, so I say if you want to give this place a try...come during happy hour to test the waters instead of paying full price for mediocre food.  The service was also lack luster, we all got our food at random times and we repeatedly had to ask if our food was still coming.  The only real perk of the restaurant is the ambiance if you have a bachelor or bachelorette party."}
{"text":"RA Sushi has a fantastic happy hour!!! Other than that, there are better places to dine at."}
{"text":"Where do I start... Instantly when I walked through the doors I noticed the floor was horribly dirty. When me and my wife sat down at the sushi bar I noticed a piece of sushi on the floor and it appeared to have been there a while. The table was extremely sticky. The air ducts were really dirty. The ac was not on or was broke I'm not to sure but it was 118 degrees outside and I can't imagine that it was good to have sushi out in this climate. Next our waitress was talking to friends while we were waiting for drinks. After we finally got our drinks the sushi came. The avocado was black, little highlights of green but for the most part black. All the sushi was hot no sign of it ever being cold. Worst sushi experience ever in my life..... Needless to say RA is dead to me I will never go to another RA ever again....."}
{"text":"I've been a RA fan for decades. Even scoped them out for a R.E. friend in SoCa back in the 90s for potential expansion.  I think the sushi chefs do a great job. The quality of the fish is always top shelf. The portions and the cuts are fair for the prices.  What I've learned is that it is not the best idea to come here at the peak dinner hour.  The hostess was polite but somewhat dismissive uncaring that, sans reservation, inside seating could take a \"long time.\" I asked to be seated at the sushi bar. We were directed to the \"far side\" of the bar which meant right at the server entrance to the kitchen and away from the Asian sushi chefs were there were more open seats. Didn't understand that.  Rarely do I call out a server. And, I'm not going to do so by name. Her name starts with \"K\" and she is brunette with a bright hair tint. She was polite. Perhaps she was responsible for a lot of tables. Whatever it was, she was far from attentive. Waters went unfilled despite numerous asks with affirmative responses from her. We had to ask for wasabi and pickled ginger and the server quickly turned that request around to our sushi chef to handle. It was 1/2 way through the meal - at the sushi bar - before plates were to be had. Again, only after having to ask. Maybe I expect too much for what gets done when seated at their bar.  We had the RA version of chips and salsa for the first time. That was amazing! Definitely worth repeating. And, the peanutbutter dessert is always a worthy way to end a night filled with excellent sushi - there simply is no way to go wrong from the hand rolls to the nagiri to the sashimi.  I'll be back, no doubt. Have not had bad food at any RA location, ever. Service can be all over the board. I'll focus on the fish and forget the rest."}
{"text":"Meh.  This wasn't that good.  Tuna was dry, avocado wasn't ripe and nothing was seasoned."}
{"text":"Tay was our waitress tonight.  My group of friends and I were completely exhausted from a long Vegas trip and a red eye flight back home and Tay went out of her way to explain the menu and made us feel comfortable.  We were at the restaurant for several hours and at no point did she make us feel like we had to make room for another party.  She was regularly checked in on us to make sure we were ok.  Her manager Dave was also amazing and recognized Tay for her excellent service.  The food was amazing, the drinks were amazing and Tay and Dave were absolutely fantastic.  This is an absolute must see spot for reasonably priced food and drinks."}
{"text":"Not a bad place.  Like some of the reviewers mentioned, this place is definitely Americanized.  Considering the location of the restaurant, this isn't really surprising.  So no, the flavors didn't strike me as Japanese, but the food was tasty, and fun. We stopped by during happy hour, and they had a lot of discounted appetizers, rolls, cocktails, and beer.  Most of the cocktails, and rolls were pretty good.  The appetizers were not bad either.  The \"Asian style\" chicken wings were tasty.  Service was okay (they were really busy). If I was shopping at Fashion Show, I would probably stop in again."}
{"text":"Excellent Food, low-lighting, friendly/professional staff, relaxing ambiance and Mello electronic/dance music. Delish!! Only drawback is the space in this place. More room would make RA a \"Fiver\" my book."}
{"text":"The wait staff made the experience delightful. Fantastic happy hour specials for drinks and food! So many delicious items to choose from. Edamame and  Miso Soup Tuna Nigiri for starters then we let our servers choose a few more rolls! All fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"I met Sarah M. for lunch today. I think Ra is an OK place for happy hour. decent drink specials and their crunchy spicy tuna roll is yummy. For meals in general, just OK. We both had the chirasha bowl, mine without rice with extra veggies (GD thyroid - I diet and still gain about a half pound a week). All tasted good but for the same price I would recommend Sushi Ken for something local."}
{"text":"Really pleasantly surprised with this sushi find.   We had big plans for dinner so I wanted something close, not outrageously priced but it had to be sushi. Enter RA Sushi Happy Hour!   They make their miso soup in house- honestly they had me at that. It was very good.  Aaron, our server, was hilarious & attentive. I had the sense he was practicing his standup; either way good combo in a server.   We ate inside as Vegas was very windy this trip but the outside patio looked cool, right out onto the strip but I had the sense it maybe a bit loud.   We had a table near the sushi bar which had a better feel than I expected. The Sushi likewise exceeded our expectations, especially given we were ordering Happy Hour items.  Loved the shishito peppers. They're always reliable. The garlic ponzu yellowtail was a major highlight. We devoured that pretty swiftly so it's the near empty plate in the photos. Served more like sashimi with no rice & a mild glaze, it was very good. We went out own way for rolls, not ordering the standard house recommendations bc there were other good things on the menu we'd rather try.  I definitely recommend this place if in Vegas, wanting sushi & not wanting to spend a fortune."}
{"text":"We absolutely are fans of this place! They have one of the very best Happy Hours in all of Las Vegas with a great covered patio right on the strip. I'm picky about sushi and won't eat it just anywhere. Here the rolls are good, the sashimi is even better.  Happy hour is Mon - Sat 3-7pm and Mon - Thurs 10pm - Midnight. Pricing is fantastic, ranging on food from $2.25 for edamame, to $4.25 for Nigiri, California Rolls, etc. to $7.25 for a Vegas or Rainbow roll plus many others. Such a bargain! They also have tons of drink specials, everything from beer, to sake to cocktails.  Some of my favorite items here are the Garlic Citrus Yellowtail, the Pineapple Cheese Wantons, Kaisen Ceviche, and of course the Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail Sashimi.  If you love sushi you'll love this happy hour"}
{"text":"I had the standard nigiri sushi assortment. Not impressed. The loud music was distracting, but this is Vegas. There isn't a whole lot to say about so-so sushi. This place seems like it's popular because it's overlooking the strip and it has a rep for a good happy hour. Maybe my expectations were too high."}
{"text":"Such a nice restaurant! We were a party of 8 coming in after a Giants spring training game so we were in rare form. Sara was awesome and one of the best most patient servers we have ever had. Food was yummy!"}
{"text":"Hurray for reverse Happy Hour starting at 10pm!! my vodka seven cost me $3 bucks!!!  Came on a Saturday night without a reservation and waited about 10-15 min for a party of 3. We were able to eat outside. Lovely time and fun to people watch. Rolls were excellent and drinks regular priced were only $5.50. I feel like that is unheard of in Vegas. I would for sure come here for their Happy Hour specials."}
{"text":"ALWAYS - Always  a AWESOME  meal here! You can not go wrong coming here hungry....Their Happy Hour is wonderful- great menu to choose from, Full bar and out door seating. I checked this place out over 2 years ago, it was wonderful then and continues to have my vote!!!"}
{"text":"Ugh only came here because my friend had a coupon. The food was eh. Out of the 5 sushi plates we got only two were adequate. I wouldn't come here again for the food, but I would come for the drinks."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour the other day. I'd heard a lot about this place and how great the happy hour is. The restaurant is very trendy with dim lights and loud dance club music. I got the crispy calamari roll for $5 and the rainbow roll for $6. We had a large party so it took about 25 minutes for my food to come out. I was starving so I scarfed it down.  The rainbow roll was good because it had a lot of variety in raw fish. But, the inside was a little bland. The crispy calamari roll was pretty good. It  had fried calamari inside, cream cheese and a sweet sauce. All-in-all the food was not bad for the price.  The biggest downside was that our server was quite rude. Maybe because we had such a big group she felt more stressed but it still was not enjoyable. It was our friend's bday so the manager gave her a fried ice cream cake and a fish bowl drink which made up for the service! :D"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and our waiter, Cornell, was incredibly awesome. The only reason I knocked a star was because the hostess told us (a group of 10) we had to wait for a table even though there was a large high top table right in front of us and that we couldn't get drinks from the bar because there wasn't a bartender.  We ordered several appetizers and a couple sushi rolls- everything was phenomenal and Cornell's laid back attitude made the overall experience great."}
{"text":"Another solid outing!  Service was prompt and friendly. The hostess was also very courteous and attentive. The food is always consistent and the sushi is some of the best in town. I would highly recommend this location and during the day the seating on the patio walk is a terrific option."}
{"text":"I usually don't give five stars, but after going to RA last night for sushi, I was very impressed,  despite the 3 star average.  I had great service and the food was top notch.  The only negative was the cost.  Rather high priced sushi, but that said, where else do you get fresh Wasabi, not the fake paste?  Yeah, that's right, that green paste is NOT Wasabi -- look it up.  As a side note, there was a cop outside this place watching people leave just prior to closing time."}
{"text":"Nothing led me to believe that my rolls or salad had been made fresh. The actual raw fish was very limited.  My rolls were 95% just rice.  The rice in the rolls were very compacted. My seaweed salad was limp and stringy.  The freshness flavor in anything was not there.  The staff's attentiveness was also lacking.  One good thing is that, so far, I'm not sick from eating old sushi."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at Ra! The tempura calamari is the best I have ever had! The spicy shrimp miso soup is soooo good! My husband had California and Philadelphia rolls and said they were very good! The beer was good and cold and our server was awesome! We have a few must go to's for our annual trip to Vegas and Ra is definitely on the top of our list!"}
{"text":"I come here regularly because I really do enjoy the atmosphere and food. As a server, most of my time spent eating out is watching our server to see if he/she really does his/her job well. Unfortunately, service at the bar can be hit or miss. I often find myself waiting several minutes to ask for ginger, wasabi, or to get our check. However, sometimes I get a bartender that is really hands on and always makes sure I have everything I need."}
{"text":"Ra Sushi is located in the Fashion Show mall allowing patrons to practically dine right on the famed Las Vegas Strip. Upon entering Ra Sushi, we were immediately greeted by a friendly hostess whom quickly gave us a view and summary of our seating options, a more formal area in the back, casual up front, the full bar with televisions, the sushi bar, or at a high top counter that runs the length of the restaurant facing Las Vegas Blvd. My wife ordered their Blushing Geisha for $8 I Samurai Cowboy,also $8. Ra Sushi offered up the usual sushi fare, Nigiri, Sashimi, Maki and speciality rolls ranging in price from $2 for QUAIL EGG \"UZURA\", to $17 for a King Crab Roll. Interested in trying their sushi, and interested in the quality of food with such reasonably priced dining on the strip, I decided to order one of their lunch specials which run from 11 am - 3 pm daily. The BARA CHIRASHI BOWL for $10.75 is served with miso soup & uchi no salad tuna. The soup was served first, the scallions still retained some of their crunch and the soy was firm, which led me to believe the soup was made fresh for me today. The uchi no salad never made it to the table, but sitting at the floor to ceiling opening on the strip located directly across from Wynn Resort & Casino, provided me with so much to see, that I honestly forgot it was a part of my meal and though missing, I never asked. The Bara Chirashi Bowl was large and plentiful containing salmon, yellowtail, shrimp, avocado & cucumber with Asian green vegetables, mixed with poki sauce; served over rice. Chilled, filling, no shortage of sushi, I will definitely order again. My wife ordered an UCHI NO SALAD for $5 containing mixed greens tossed in a soy ginger vinaigrette which arrived with my soup. The salad was a good portion yet not overwhelming so. The greens were fresh, and the ingredients in the vinaigrette complimented each other nicely. She also ordered an appetizer as an entrée. The LOBSTER SPRING ROLLS for $11.75 contained lobster mixed with mango, cream cheese & mild peppers, wrapped in wonton paper & lightly fried; served with a mango sauce. Unfortunately, after the salad and soup were cleared, my lunch bowl arrived, and my wife's lobster rolls had not. We assumed, that for some reason, the server was making two trips, but they were not. We did not wait long before the waitress checked in, surprised and apologetic with regards to our missing food, she promised to have it out right away. The Lobster Spring Rolls did make it to our table fairly quickly. The rolls were delicious. And though we were friendly, and beyond asking for our food, truly did not complain at all, our waitress informed us that her manager did not charge us for the lobster and asked if there were anything else she could do for us. Lunch for two adults looking over the Las Vegas Strip, on the strip, including soup, salad, two fun cocktails, and just a little confusion mixed in with friendly fast service cost us just $40 including tip. The confusion saved us $12. The Las Vegas Strip contains many, many places to eat, and it runs 4 miles long. That being said, if you find yourself at the Fashion Show mall, or any where close by, Ra Sushi is a wonderful, affordable place to eat, and I will definitely be dining there again."}
{"text":"The greeter was the sole good point about Ra. He greeted us quickly and warmly and seated us in one of 5gebmany, many open tables immediately.   There were a couple of guys at the bar and two other tables - other than that the place was empty. There were a flurry of employees running about as if the place were packed.   We sat. And sat. And sat. Fifteen minutes. No water, no \"how ya doin\" no \"be right with ya\".   The many employees flitting about seemed more concerned with their coworker ending his shift than serving paying customers.  I expected more from a place like Ra."}
{"text":"Obviously over-priced, but it's still a hangout for me when I'm buzzed and want some fish in my belly to soothe the blurriness/dizziness that suddenly surrounds me whenever I happen to be on Mill Ave late at night.  The only time I actually do think it's worth coming here other than when I'm not right in my mind, spirit, body, and whatever else I lost control of is on Tuesdays for lunch when it's \"bring a friend, get your own meal for free\". To get the best deal, order the sashimi lunch and split the check and you both got 12 pieces of \"small portioned but what do you expect when they know you're trying to squeeze a free meal out of them\" mix of sashimi each for about 6 something tax included. Not too shabby for a Tuesday lunch break."}
{"text":"Had some great drinks here on Happy hours. Had the Emperor's margarita (try cucumber and strawberry combo) and the Dragonbite ( I think) really yummy? Also had the shrimp wonton tacos and Vegas roll. Service was excellent and place was clean! Ill be back!"}
{"text":"What happened? It used to be so good! I think the Keirland location is better. The Vegas rolls seemed pre made and reheated. Service is hit or miss. The last server really slow when they weren't even busy."}
{"text":"I am so grateful that RA is nearby and open late! My work schedule is quite late but I'm always excited because I know RA has \"Reverse Happy Hour\" till close! What an amazing perk that always reminds me to come back!  Some things that I love about RA: the modern Japanese theme, open seating at the bar, quick and friendly service (always very attentive), great selection for happy hour and the creative seasonal drinks!   Although this is a pretty common sushi restaurant you can find all over the valley, they definitely do a great job with creating new sushi rolls and drinks to keep you interested and coming back for more! I've always been a fan! You also can't go wrong with the Crunch Calamari Roll!"}
{"text":"Came here after a long, first night out in Vegas and a LONG and HOT walk along the strip. Let's just say, we were on a mission for sushi!!! Upon arrival, we were greeted by the hostess who sat us right away. The decor was dark and mysterious with glows of red all around. We were sat in a comfortable booth and promptly greeted by our server. I forget her name but she was nice.   Whenever my cousins and I go out to eat, we EAT. By this I mean, our eyes were definitely hungrier than our stomachs.   We ordered all types of food, from the small plates (albacore onion or something or another, tuna salsa, a micro green salad of some sort, seaweed salad) which were ALL DELICIOUS, to a chicken bowl and sushi. We also ordered some sushi rolls which were bland and tasteless and obviously not their specialty. One of my cousins also ordered the sesame chicken, which we did not even touch.   We did order 3 of the Chirashi bowls. Oh boy, HAND DOWN, my favorite sushi thing EVER!!! It wasn't your typical chirashi bowl with sushi rice topped with sashimi. There was an amazing vinaigrette, tangy and complimented the fresh fish, and wakame (seaweed salad) throughout. We demolished the bowls and wanted to order more to go but sushi and the unforgiving Sin City sun was nothing to mess around with.  I will definitely be returning the next time I am in Sin City."}
{"text":"Great service!  I was extremely impressed by our waitress.  The food was average but nothing special.  We ordered an avocado roll, which was very good, and a vegetarian roll, which was comprised of peculiar ingredients and overall was not very tasty.  I have had better sushi other places, but if I was craving sushi and in the neighborhood I would certainly stop by RA again.  Also, as an added bonus, if you check-in on Foursquare you receive a free bowl of edamame."}
{"text":"This review is for several different visits.  Ra is not far from the Boyfriend's place and I love that they have late night and a good happy hour.    Things can be hit or  miss here.  We previously came here for their 4 items for $25 and had nice service and good food.  Other times we've come and had smelly sushi (ahi tuna should not smell fishy) and my salad had dried up pieces of lettuce in it.  Not wilted, so old it was dried up and crispy.  Sometimes the staff is knowledgeable, other times they don't know what type of fish their summer special, Red Seabream, is comparable to.  The good has outweighed the bad so this is a 3 star review when it is closer to a 2.5 star review.  Other than the email specials/gift cards they send me and the late night menu, I would eat local for sushi."}
{"text":"The only thing consistent about this place is how often they get my take out order wrong. I've given it lots of tries because I used to live within walking distance and it has mostly ended in regret.     The ambience when dining in feels like an arcade more than a restaurant and trying to have a conversation inside is a nightmare."}
{"text":"RA Sushi is telling me they are not willing service bento boxes so we left. What a joke at Ray Road. Fire that manager.... When been going there for years and years. What a joke of a manager. She let us walk out. How hard is it to make our meal."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE! The service was so terrible, first of all the manager as soon as we walked in was rude my sister in law walked I front of him by accident and he goes \"EXCUSE ME!\" In a more than necessary rude tone. And then our server didnt know anything you would've thought it was his first hour. Point blank horrible service and was a very bad choice service wise for Mother's Day. Although the food was tasty the service made me never wanna ever wanna go back."}
{"text":"Happy Hour specials are great at this place! I stuck to the happy hour menu, and glanced at the regular sushi menu, and those prices aren't bad either! We sat at the sushi bar and it was really convenient ordering by handing the chef our orders that we checked on the menu. We got our sushi in a decent amount of time and it was pretty good quality. For sushi in Vegas this place is very reasonably priced!   One thing that sort of pissed me and my friend off was the waitress. They got our order wrong, and she snatched the check from my friend and a bunch of paper flew on me. She didn't even apologize. However, our order was fixed, but still, that didn't help her tip!  I wouldn't hesitate to come back to this place during happy hour on my next Vegas trip!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend demanded that we try this place....... Still terrible for all the same reasons.  I only would come here if my life was threatened unless I complied."}
{"text":"I will never get over you RA. Ever!  This place holds a special spot in my heart, my trips to Vegas, and a notch in my checkbook! I love the dining experience, both inside and outside. The food, service and drinks are ALWAYS topnotch.  Please try the Cucumber Margarita, drink two for me, two for you, and thank me in the morning.. after you find your pants!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"try these: pineapple cheese wonton scallop dynamite - order w/ a cup of rice :) viva las vegas gojira roll  You cant go wrong with the happy hour from 4-7pm"}
{"text":"This sushi spot is located within walking distance to my house and while out taking a stroll on a Sunday evening this place is the perfect spot to pick up a bite! The happy hour deals cannot be beat and the quality is fresh and flavorful. My boyfriend and I tried several different types of rolls and sashimi, all of them were delicious & fresh. Our server was sweet but somewhat slow, even though there were only a few tables in the restuarant. Despite this we still had an excellent meal and a wonderful time together. The ambiance is perfect for intimate meals or for hanging out with friends! We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Nice hip atmosphere...who know Arizona could be trendy?  Interesting fusion sushi rolls: Crazy Monkey Roll - smoked salmon,mango,and cream cheese topped with avocado, red tempura bits, cashew nuts and drizzeld with mango sauce; Mexican inspired roll that had jalapeno, pico de gallo and fish.  This place got me interested in seeing if I can find restaurants back in Cali with fusion sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Okay i loveeeeeeee this location. Their restaurant has always been clean when I went and their food is on point. I have gone there during the most busy times like Valentine's Day and they were on top of it all with exceptional service ....yes for the amount of food and alcohol they are a bit on the pricier side but it honestly is well worth it ..... On another note I love their outside seating . Even on a hot AZ day"}
{"text":"Very good.  I came with expectations of overpriced, small portions. I got well priced, excellent sushi and a large portion."}
{"text":"I love RA but always have particularly terrible service at this location. Yesterday, I had my dog with me and called beforehand and asked if they allow dogs on the patio. The girl on the phone said yes, so I headed over there. I sat down on the patio and when the server came to bring us water, she looked at my dog disgusted that he was there and made sure to not get anywhere near him when setting the waters down. I apologized and kept him by my side, and she responded in a super annoyed voice \"it's fine.\" As soon as she walked away my boyfriend also pointed it out saying \"she must not like dogs. Who doesn't like dogs though?\" Ten minutes later she came back out and told me he's not allowed there and I need to tie him up out front in a very rude tone. I told her I called beforehand and was told dogs are allowed on the patio. She said \"they are, they just have to be tied up on the opposite side of the gate so that they are not on the patio\" I said, okay, so dogs aren't allowed on the patio. She continued to argue with me saying that they are, but still telling me he had to be tied up out front...which again...means that they aren't. She was so rude and condescending that we just decided to leave. I called the RA off ray and asked again if dogs were allowed on the patio, the girl said yes, so we went there. Our server this time was instantly excited and asked if he could bring him out a bowl of water (which I don't think a place would do if dogs are not allowed on the patio). Three different servers came out while we were there to say hi to him and not one of them said anything about not allowing dogs. This girl was clearly full of it and just didn't want him there. I will only go to the ray location from now on."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh sushi.  Ashley is the best server ever.  Drinks kept coming. Awesome decore.  Overall top notch experience."}
{"text":"In 18 years of sushi eating Ra is 1 of 2 places I have ever sent something back.  Review complete."}
{"text":"Decent Sushi bar, especially for a college town. The staff are nice, use the sushi bar as the chefs are over the top accommodating."}
{"text":"Going to post every single day , as a family man was disrespect and treated as garbage by management (Tim) , food came out 40 min late in Scottsdale and accused of being intoxicated after one Budweiser and half a socki bomber .. charged us the full tab.. and when my daughter had a change of diaper a man in the bathroom was also rude and telling me to get outta the way while i was trying to but her diaper on while they have no family restrooms nor anything for her to lay on besides the floor ...will never go there again !!!!!!!!!!!!!  Worst Experience EVER!!!! i hope the have cameras so i can pull the tape GEEZEEE"}
{"text":"Since writing my last review, this location has improved tremendously. Mind you, my last review was directly mostly towards a specific bartender who seemed to not know exactly how to make their signature drinks and lacked in the customer service department. Since then, i have been there a few times, and i can say I'm back to being a regular customer. After writing my last review, I was promptly responded to by the regional manger. They advised that the necessary steps were being taken to ensure my experience would not be experience by others or myself again. Since, I can honestly say the experience has improved drastically. Our server today, Anu, was amazing. We had him a few other times and he is super friendly and makes our drinks perfectly (cute too)! If you ever get a chance to served by him, you will be pleasantly surprised at his level of customer service!"}
{"text":"This bar is based more on looks rather than authenticity of Sushi. Not that I have a problem with promoting ambiance, but I'm more about authenticity and dive places. Additionally the service was rather shoddy and IMHO rather racist. There was definitely a perceptible difference in  service to people of the brown leaning as compared to the paler people. I've been told that's a Phoenix mentality ( but I still thinks it's absolutely wrong).  As for  the sushi well the gaari was bitter ( a good sign that the place is unauthentic) and the slices of fish (which I ordered, tuna and salmon ) were too thick ( on the maki) and in the rolls too skimpy. Shushi doesn't have too many variables to play around  with so the way to determine its goodness is based on these parameters (also on the taste/texture of the rice). The lighting was too dim for a raw meat food joint.   The  servers were attractive though (again a sign that what they are selling isn't food)"}
{"text":"If I had one word to describe RA Sushi it would be \"Dingleberry\" basically the last restaurant hanging on by a thread at the Fashon Show. The staff was Amazing until New management fired everyone and replaced them with mediocre replacements. I'm.really looking forward to Kona Grill opening this fall to put the final nail in the coffin. Basides that the food is not that good and the place is dated from the late 90's and resembles a Bally's gym locker room."}
{"text":"RA happy hour is always my go to. I rarely go when it isn't happy hour, but they do have some awesome lunch specials too! My personal faves are the Las Vegas Roll, Seared Tuna, Spicy Shrimp Roll and the Crispy Spicy Tuna. In terms of appetizers, I love the Dengaku Tofu and the Pork Gyoza! All of which are on happy hour :) service at this location can be hit or miss though, so I wouldn't suggest coming here if you are on a huge time crunch. Quality of food is always spot on though!"}
{"text":"I personally wouldn't come back here again. The waiters were wonderful but the price I paid wasn't worth it. I felt like my sushi was meh and my miso soup tasted like it came out of a bag. Salty. gross."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere isn't so bad, it's a very upbeat environment, great place to go eat before you hit the clubs, cause the DJ pumps you up to party. However, can't say the same for the food. The sushi rolls are tiny and not good at all, way to pricey for what you get. They taste like supermarket sushi rolls. The server was nice but he constantly forgot about us. I like this sushi chain of restaurants but I will never go to the Vegas one again!"}
{"text":"Over one year later, this review is behind, but wanted to get it out there... as I can still remember how terrible this place treated us. Hopefully, they've fired the manager and upped their customer service...  We have been coming here for a couple years until last Spring training 2010. We had a party of 10 people. We loved going here because of the vibrant atmosphere and the sushi. So what transpired was this. We had a reservation, obviously it was busy, so even with a reservation we were seated an hour and half over our reservation time. It was fine, as we ordered drinks by the bar and waited. We then got our table, it took another half an hour  to order and another 45 minutes to get our food - so time frame was now almost 3 hours since we got to this restaurant. Half the people got their food and took another 15-20 minutes later for the rest of us to get our food. It was a lot of waiting...We ordered more sushi and it took another half an hour. Really - rolling sushi would take that long?! So we wanted to talk to the manager. They sent someone over and told him what happened. This is what he said \" If you didn't like the service, go ahead leave, we have a ton of business and we'd rather turn the table for other patrons!\" So I said, really,this is how you address the situation, without appologizing even and telling us to leave. We asked again to talk to the manager...he said I am the manager. What?! Everyone was so upset by this point and threw their money for their food on the table and left. This was the worst service I've ever gotten anywhere - ever! So to Ra Sushi - you've lost 10 customers for life..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I do not eat sushi. So this review has nothing to do with fish... can't comment on that. Anyway, I went here last night for my new sister in law's bachelorette party. When we called earlier, the hostess said they do not take reservations, even for a party of 9 people. That was weird considering it sure seemed like some parties had reservations. So we got there and were told a half hour wait which we spent in the bar. Now, we didn't get seated for an hour... that's just not cool. Their drinks were alright, but overpriced. When we finally got seated things got better. I ordered the uchi no salad and some gyoza. The salad was really good, I just love that ginger dressing. The gyoza were fine, nothing crazy special, but not bad by any means. Everyone seemed alright with their food, so that wasn't the problem. The real problem was the service, the hostess, and the music (we couldn't hear each other at all... and I know it's in old town and everyone wants to party, but I would like to hear conversation)."}
{"text":"I went here the other day with some friends for lunch. I got the chicken teriyaki bento box, which was actually a great deal. For 8$ I got miso soup, salad, spring roll, one gyoza, rice, chicken, and veggies. Whoa. Now it wasn't all the best food ever, but it was ok. The soup was just alright, the salad wasn't as good as the last time I had it, but it was still good. The spring roll was probably the best thing... it was perfectly fried and the veggies in it tasted good unlike most spring rolls out there. The chicken was a little bland. Overall, this place is alright, nothing awesome but not bad."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty good, especially for Arizona and I love their happy hour! I have been here several times and the service changes depending on the server, some servers are very outgoing and attentive, but a few seem a bit careless and it can definitely affect your eating experience.   Overall, I would suggest going to dinner here, especially during the happy hour."}
{"text":"I had been here one other time before this last time and I know why I went back. We were seated right away on a Saturday night at 8pm and there were four in out party. We got an awesome table outside with a great view of the strip. The sushi was very fresh and they have a great selection of sake. For being Vegas I was really surprised how cheap our meal was. I can't wait to eat here again next time I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour is awesome, tons of stuff to choose from. I love love love the lobster spring rolls. Food is really fresh. Great service, Fun atmosphere and location! Prices are very reasonable, especially happy hour. I've never been disappointed at RA."}
{"text":"The happy hour is legit, especially if you're on a budget but there's not much inventive about Ra's menu, decor, or dining experience.   I will say that I've never had bad service at any Ra, which speaks to a pretty good corporate structure and training program. Water glasses are always filled and if there's ever a problem with the food or drinks their people are quick to remedy the situation.   The music is generally pretty decent. Eclectic mix, with everything from Biggie and Beasties to Ramones and Zeppelin. Can skew a tad loud though.  If you're looking to blow off some steam after work Ra is a solid option. And if you're with a gal, she'll more than likely approve."}
{"text":"Do not go to this r.a they have fat healthy looking cockroaches crawling at the bar where the meat is! And manager did not apologize or acknowledge! Simply said \"happens all the time because they have the door open\". Completely lost my appetite!"}
{"text":"Some great prices for the Vegas area, especially happy hour. My wife used to live in Chicago and said she would eat at the RA there every day. We got a salmon poke bowl; a shrimp tempura; viva Las Vegas roll; & spicy lobster roll; all were super tasty and excellent priced. Worth a visit for sure. Viva Las Vegas roll is delicious!"}
{"text":"Love this very modern sushi spot that won't disappoint you.  This location is perfect with everything you need close by for example the movie theater. Came in was seated right away and helped immediately.  The staff was helpful and took care of anything needed a night right away   Make sure you order the lychee sake it was amazing. We ordered multiple rolls so I did forget the names sorry but each roll was perfect and left is wanting more.   You have to make it here even though it's a franchise name the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"I've eaten at RA many times and have always enjoyed it, our server was wonderful, however after a friend and I went to dinner and experienced severe food poisoning on 5/18/2017 the management was no help. They offered us a 5 dollar refund from our tab of about $60 and told us they weren't the cause of our sickness. I was shocked. I have never been so ill in my life and as a food service worker myself with a degree in culinary arts from Johnson and Wales University, I am well aware of what I could have consumed to make me as ill as I was and unfortunately it was the Sushi. Had their guest service relations been more accommodating about the situation I would have considered going back, and eaten something other than sushi but they've lost two guests for life. I usually recommend RA Sushi to people however I will now be telling people to steer clear. Unfortunately for RA I send a lot of guests out into old town Scottsdale on restaurant recommendations, RA will be one I take off of our concierge list."}
{"text":"Love RA restaurants and the service and food are usually really good. This time, my boyfriend and I ordered the crunchy calamari roll which was okay (the crab mix seemed dry), the nutty chicken salad (good!) and two orders of yellowtail nigiri. Now, is both having been in the sushi restaurant industry and also being frequent sushi eaters, the yellowtail nigiri served was pathetic. The fish was skimpy, and thin, and one even had a tear in it from being cut too thinly. Disappointing. I don't expect RA Sushi to serve high end sushi, but I expect some kind of industry standard. Service was nice but overall the food was not up to par."}
{"text":"Nice place. Lots of seating with sushi bar seating also..  probably good for large parties, but the rolls had no real flavor.  They were good, but not satisfying for some reason.  They have all the normal roll choices and a lot of their rolls have cream cheese which we avoid.   They serve fast. The fish seemed fresh, but would tear and shred as you tries to pick up with sticks... to me that means boarder line old, but I am a novice.  It all looked fresh and was OK, but we have had other sushi and look at each other and said wow..  this.. so/so... not bad, but not great."}
{"text":"We went there New Years Day and you know how food can taste after NYE.  Well the food was great and the price of it was even better. Will definitely be hitting this spot again."}
{"text":"My family and I have had dinner here several times always with a party of 8 or more. We always have great service and delicious food. My only complaint is the loud music makes it hard to have a conversation and it's always freezing cold. Be sure to bring a jacket."}
{"text":"LOVE the sushi, but the service could use a hug, especially during lunch-hour."}
{"text":"We love this place for happy hour & people watching. I guess they don't offer happy hour on Sunday (only reverse happy hour). Still super yummy food, bartender was low energy and slow to refill water.   RA-kin shrimp was super yummy!"}
{"text":"I have been to all the RA's in the Valley and this one has been the best by far!!! Went with a friend on Friday night for happy hour, had amazing sushi and drink specials and ended up staying way past happy hour was over because we had the BEST waiter ever!! Our Waiter Shad made our experience at RA so much fun and the service he provided has been some of the best I have experienced in the Valley!! If you go to RA, ask for Shad, you won't be disapointed!!!"}
{"text":"I went to RA Sushi on Saturday around 6pm, in time for happy hour!  Happy hour is from Monday-Saturday 3-7pm.  I love happy hour food because it's always cheaper and it's just as good.  This is my first time at RA Sushi. I haven't been to any other locations either.  RA Sushi actually reminds me of Americanized sushi and not authentic sushi; however, it is still tasty.   When we arrived, we found a table and the waitress greeted us immediately. She was nice and asked us about whether we've been there before. My other friends been there before, it was my first time. So we decided to only order off the happy hour menu. They ordered sake with the beer. We also decided to split two rolls, seared tuna and shishito peppers. We ordered the Viva Las Vegas Roll and Tootsy Maki.   The seared tuna was delicious. There was only about 5 pieces of tuna and the sauce it came in was tasty, it was a creamish color sauce. It also had little beads on top of it that was black and white color, possibly sesame seeds. The tuna tasted fresh.  The rolls did not have any raw food in them, all the seafood was cooked. (I love raw seafood such as sashimi). In the Tootsy Maki, it was tasty, nothing was too overpowering. The Viva Las Vegas had a little crispy top to it that added a crunch to it, it seemed like it was just deep fried batter. It says on the menu it's topped with a lotus root, it looks like it is in the shape of a lotus root but the taste of it didn't remind me of one. Maybe because it was so thinly sliced and deep fried, I couldn't tell what I was eating. In some of my bites, I could taste the cream cheese and sometimes it would overpower my bite slightly.  I would recommend these rolls if you like cooked seafood and you don't mind cream cheese/mayo in your rolls. They are what I considered your \"safe sushi\" if you're not an adventurous sushi eater!  I think they're good but I prefer more fish and sashimi in the rolls. They reminded me of the typical rolls I can get at other chain sushi places in other areas.   Parking is easy in this area because it's a mall."}
{"text":"Our server Michael gave us excellent service and was very nice! If you go during happy hour, prices are not too bad either. Fun atmosphere and cool ambiance. The sushi rolls look very appealing and interesting. The only issue I have is the taste of the fish that was on top of the Vegas roll (which is my favorite usually). It tasted like old fish and like they might have used left over fish from the day before. I eat sushi often, and know the difference between fresh fish and smelly old one. You can do better than that Ra!"}
{"text":"Just about the best sushi you can get on the Vegas strip! They even have Saturday happy hour that includes many delicious rolls and even hot sake. They do offer a generous military discount on top of all that.  The service was perfect and the staff is very knowledgeable about the menu items. As a sushi lover this was by far the best bang for my buck.  The prices are very affordable and the atmosphere is nice.  Check them out when you go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for happy hour last week and had a pleasant experience. At 5PM there was a good amount of people dining both inside and outside but there wasn't a wait. Happy Hour runs from 3PM-7PM and they have a fair amount of discounted options. IMO, the drinks were still average price. I think I ordered a bellini for $7 as opposed to it being maybe $9 but it tasted good and had a decent amount of alcohol. I also ordered the pineapple and cheese wontons and a crispy calamari roll. The wontons were good, not the best I've ever had, and I thought the pineapple would be mixed in with the cream cheese but it was actually a pineapple dipping sauce. The dipping sauce was tasty though. I had never had a crispy calamari roll before, think a shrimp tempura roll but with calamari. It had some type of green crunch on it with cream cheese inside and I loved it. My friend ordered a viva Las Vegas roll which I tried; it was lighter than most Las Vegas rolls, for sure. I'm not a fan of deep fried rolls but again, this tasted so light that I didn't mind it at all. As stated in previous reviews, the music was fairly loud but not to the point where I couldn't hear my friend speak. Customer service was on point, we were seated pretty much right away and our waitress was attentive and personable. We split the check and I ended up spending about $27 altogether which was more than I had intended for a Happy Hour where I wasn't getting sloshed but for the quality of the sushi and the drinks, I didn't mind. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I love, love this place. I love their sushi, not as good as Ninja sushi, but good for the price. I prefer to come during happy hour to save some money. Sometimes you get a dingy waitress, sometimes you don't; just like with any trendy spot. Try the fishbowl drink with a friend at least once."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour Specials. 3pm - 7pm Mon - Saturday.  Tunacado was the best!!! Spicy Tuna was delicious, great endamame & seaweed salad. Bar was packed, but we found 2 seats.   I can't wait to go back! Great, friendly service!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and happy hour.  Horrible service.  We might as well be waiting our own table.  :/"}
{"text":"This place was eh for me (even considering that it's a low-price sushi establishment). My sister and I shared salmon sashimi, a shrimp tempura hand roll, the special yellowtail hand roll, and a lobster shrimp cut roll.   Although we ordered the lobster shrimp cut roll the sushi chef made a lobster salmon cut roll instead. The server brought out the wrong roll and was strongly trying to get us to give in and just eat the wrong roll. I hate when restaurants get things wrong and then try to have you accept their mistake. We ordered the lobster shrimp roll because after having salmon sashimi we didn't want to have more salmon. I refused and they made us the roll we had actually ordered.   The food is ok. It's a somewhat low priced sushi place and that's the quality you get. The salmon sashimi was really cold as though it had been frozen and didn't quite defrost and the cut roll portion size was kind of small. Eh."}
{"text":"Some friends and myself decided to try RA's happy hour for the first time and we were very pleased.  The staff was very friendly and fast and helped us with everything that we needed.  The happy hour menu was great; there were lots of options to choose from and everyone easily found something that they liked.  Unfortunately, there were not very many wine options for happy hour so I stuck with my water.  The dining setting was wonderful as well, it felt very secluded and private, unlike other restaurants where you have to yell in order to be heard.  The happy hour prices are great and I will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Ra Sushi today.   The sushi was okay.  They are standard.  Usually my wife and I do not go to chain restaurants.  The one dish that we both liked was the Tuna Tataki.    Please turn down the music!!  This is the reason that my wife and I asked to sit outside.  The music was simply too loud."}
{"text":"I had a great time at Ra Sushi.  In fact, I went there 3 different times when I was here at a conference.    The sushi is very good for being so far from the water and they have some seriously good sake.    The service was much better at the bar than when I sat with a friend of mine who flew in for the weekend, but still damn good fish.    I'd definitely be stopping by here again."}
{"text":"Hit and miss on service.  Food was good, but took 20 min on order of desert.  Also ordered a beer and it took 15 min for it to hit the table.  Again good food spotty service."}
{"text":"This RA is an ASU staple. Been coming here since I was a freshman back in 2003. Hasn't changed too much! Great happy hour. The cripsy rice spicy tuna roll is awesome! Definitely get that. I really enjoyed my mango martini as well. They are a little (soy) saucy here with the yellowtail and albacore nigiri, but didn't bother me too much. I especially love the quick service here. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends . The food was great the drinks where are good. I recommended for Saturday night dinner."}
{"text":"Best sushi place in Oldtown Scottsdale! Sasha served us the night we went and she's amazing! Loved her! Recommend this spot 100%"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan. I have been many times and it never gets old for me. LOVE their happy hour specials. The salmon carpaccio is to die for, and their drinks are pretty good.  I usually hit up RA on a monthly basis or more :)"}
{"text":"I visited RA Sushi earlier this evening. I was seated promptly at the sushi bar and the hostess was very polite. I ordered the Chili Shrimp roll, which was very delicious. I had finished my roll when I noticed a cockroach walk across the sushi bar. The cockroach was headed straight for the plate of food another guest had ordered. The manager offered the other guest coupons for free rolls after the incident, but I really think the meal should have been comped.   Safe to say, I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Borderline average sushi.  This is a place to see and be seen, but not a serious sushi destination.  Ra is for the status conscious, and I don't quite understand why as it is not particularly trendy, fancy or special."}
{"text":"Sushi was exceptional the cooks were very friendly and my sever was great I am giving this place a 5"}
{"text":"What can I say about this place? Sushi is not great but I don't expect it to be. This isn't exactly a city by the ocean. The price is ok especially when you look at the other Japanese restaurants on the strip that are 2 to 3 times more expensive for the same or similar types of dishes. I just had a bento box with beef teriyaki for about 8 bucks at lunch time. A friend of mine had something similar. They were ok. We also ordered nigiri salmon(wasn't that fresh). Total with tip was close to 30 bucks. If you want some cheap Japanese food, come here. You can PROBABLY get better on the strip; just be prepared to pay lot more."}
{"text":"The place was packed but we had our in our \"reservation\" through Open Tables. We sat outside among the misters to stay cool. Our server was amazing!! To our surprise we arrived during their happy hour and scored awesome deals on their drinks and rolls. Absolutely would go back here. The sushi was amazing!!"}
{"text":"I went again today, and got the Avocado rolls. Nothing special... The green tea smelled like feet and was cold. I'm sorry RA, I know you hang out the cool kids, but if I want sushi I'm going to find someplace a little less mediocre."}
{"text":"First time in AZ  + First time melting in 117 degree heat+ First time trying sushi =  L O V E      Ok i'm def. no sushi expert but ever since trying it here at RA, im hooked!!  the rolls in my opinion are creative and fun, and the appetizers (especially the lobster spring rolls) are DELISH!!    Its got a trendy vibe kind of on the darker side which i loved and the servers were helpful and knowledgable with all our questions.  So that was a year and  a half ago and RA is still a must for us :)   Go for happy hour and you will def leave happy :)"}
{"text":"I spent my last birthday here, and I bring all out-of-town guests to a Ra to try it.  Their happy hour prices are amazing, especially for the sake bombs and the Tootsie Maki.  Mmm.  I think the service has always been good too, especially considering how busy they get.  This place is fun, and the trendy dcor is pretty classy.  Great for drinks, pigging out on sushi, dates, or family meals.  (I've seen kids at the other locations.)  And it's definitely a great place to celebrate your birthday!  I love to come here for long lunches as well."}
{"text":"Fresh sushi, incredible garlic edamame, and great service. Try to make it by here every time in in the area."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Long wait to find out they were out of smoked salmon, rude staff. Speaking to the waiter, and he walked away from me when asking about the roll. It was as if I had bored him, and the hostess was less then thrilled to seat us. I could go on, and on, but I will not waste my time. Train your staff, and make them happy. It starts at the top."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Ra Sushi fan for years. Tonight, I went into Ra Sushi Dana Park for reverse happy hour around 1045 pm. I asked for a regular table, not a high top, and was told the regular table section was closed. There were 4 or 5 tables still eating in that section and quite a few customers in the bar section. I would like to remind this restaurant (and others) that there may be reasons a customer may not be able to sit at a high top table, due to a disability or other valid reason, like my own. I left, saddened that I am no longer going to be frequenting one of my favorite late night restaurants in the future. Loyal fan, no more."}
{"text":"Great restuarant, we love sushi and this place has a different twist on it, I love how late they're open, we were literally eating sushi at 11pm, way cool. BTW, the Tempura-fried Japanese pumpkin is goooood. Be warned, it's loud in here!"}
{"text":"Ra is a tradition for us. When I get to \"go home\" to the valley there always seems to be a girls' night out. Great service and great food, all the time. Try their coconut creme brulee if you're in the mood for something sweet. You won't be disappointed! Prices are best at happy hour- of course."}
{"text":"I really love this place for their happy hour! $7 for a large beer and small sake? wins my heart! for their rolls listed under the happy hour menu I'd go for the rainbow just cause I love raw fish and less of the more deep fried/baked rolls. also the hamachi something something was really good too! it was hamachi sashimi in ponzu sauce. I'd come back for more. although I wish the small sake bottles held more than 4 shots."}
{"text":"The sushi was good enough - nothing to blow your mind but good enough that I would possibly consider a return trip if I was regularly in the area.  But the service was pretty terrible.  Our server was pretty clueless about our menu questions, and he rarely checked in.  He was at a level at which I thought he was new, but it didn't seem like he was shadowing or that anyone was helping, so perhaps not.  I considered giving them a 3 star based on the food and reasonable prices during happy hour, but you can find such better service on the Strip.  They would have earned it with a different server, no doubt!  One shining moment from our visit  - Try the Emperor's Cucumberita -  yum!"}
{"text":"Great sushi bar! Came here with a party of 12 and wasn't disappointed by the food. I highly recommend starting off with the RA rocking shrimp! The sauce it comes with is similar to a \"yum yum\" sauce and it pairs beautifully! The roll I recommend is the chili crab roll it was amazing! The only complaint I have is our service was extremely extremely slow. I understand we had a large party and we were all patient when receiving our food. Although when it came time to receive  our checks, that process was over complicated and unnecessary. He collected all of our cards and then did not run them. He brought back all of our cards and asked us to collect them again... not sure why he took so long to bring them back if he never even ran the cards in the first place. A few people at our table ordered saki and beer and instead of telling us the size of the beer was double the normal size, and instead of asking how many, he brought about 12, 40 ounce beers for the table when about 7 were drinking. This resulted in 5 or so 40 ounce beers wasted and unpaid for...... the food was delicious though but that server needs more training."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here twice, once about 4 years ago, and then again last week. The Sushi is great, the Sushi chefs are a riot, the atmosphere is great, the service is good. They even brought us this AMAZING dessert for our anniversary, and we ended up eating almost the whole thing because it rocked! We ordered two tall beers, two hot sake's, about 3-4 rolls, an app and 4 pieces of sushi, and paid about $72.00, which is very reasonable and inexpensive for sushi and what we ordered, especially on the strip. If we do come back to Vegas, we will visit again, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here last weekend for a Bachelorette party. The initial thoughts of the place were that it was sleek and looked like it had great sushi! I was right about the great sushi part because it was actually delicious, but that does not outweigh our TERRIBLE service that we had.  The night started out fine and it seemed like our server had 15 girls under control. We ordered drinks/apps first, then entrees. Everyone's food came out randomly which is fine, but he completely forgot to bring out the bride's order... yikes. He seemed to get more gradually annoyed at us, but I guess we were a big group. You'd think they would be used to bigger groups in Vegas though. So after everyone was eating for a while, he finally brought out the bride's entree and proceeded to charge her for that, which I didn't agree with.  Then comes the good part... when the check came, he put it all on ONE check. This would take forever to try and figure out, so we asked for him to split it in separate checks. I'm not kidding when I say his exact words were \"I don't have time to sit and split the check for everyone because it would take too long, and I know me and all of you have things to do and places to go\" - I mean not exact, but that's basically what he said. EXTREMELY RUDE. So guess what. We sat there for almost 45 minutes trying to split that freaking check, when we had places to be and bachelorette plans at night. He kept ignoring our table after that and avoiding us. We asked to see a manager, and his response was \"why do you want to see my manager\" ... are you kidding? The bride's mom and her friends did not let anything sit, so they were talking to our server, then finally the manager... I'm not sure how anything got resolved. So after all of that chaotic mess, we ended up putting it on one bill and giving cash/paying by Venmo, which was still a mess. What a disaster.  This was probably one of the worst service and dining experience I've ever had, and I think that most/all of the girls would also agree. DO NOT go here in big groups, and don't expect good service. It's sad because the sushi was good, but definitely not worth the experience."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at RA. All was fresh and out quick with incredible flavors. Sat on the patio and enjoyed the passers by and the energy of the day.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Some people hate chain restaurants, but so far I haven`t had any issues with this Ra or the one at Kierlands. Sushi was fresh, flavorful and just right. Take advantage of their happy hour , good specials! I`m a sashimi fan so had the salmon and halibut. Very good.  And so was the ultimate shrimp tempura roll. Lively atmosphere and another people watch place!"}
{"text":"They have Tuna Nachos... Yup - mind blown.    1/2 price sushi before 6 doesn't hurt either."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great. Loved the decor and style of this establishment. Ate lunch outside, large party. The waiter was fairly attentive. Had I not been visiting with friends I hadn't seen in months who knows if I would have not expected more. The middle stall of the women's bathroom has a door that is impossible to lock. The door is offset to the point that I couldn't lift it up high enough to get the latch locked. There's no way the door will stay shut without using one hand the entire time to keep it shut. Quite annoying. The food was pretty good. It wasn't spectacular enough for me to make another 45 min drive to return though. :("}
{"text":"The management staff responded very prompt to a complaint I made as a consumer and I greatly appreciate that they didn't fight about it, they just stepped up and took responsibility for it. That's great follow up customer service. I will try your establishment again in the future because of this."}
{"text":"Went tonight for my first time.  Wasn't impressed.  The server Madison wasnt attentive at all.  We had to ask for refills, we asked for sweetener 3 times before she finally remembered(about 10 minutes later)  our food took forever( and we went in at 430 so it wasn't busy) and everything came out at different times,  my sister was almost done when my kids got their food and mine came out about 5 minutes later. Food was decent, my salmon teriyaki was over cooked but edible. I didn't want to send it back and wait even longer.  When we were done,  i had to flag down the server to get a box and the check.  Over all, i wouldn't bother to go back."}
{"text":"We have eaten at least a dozen times at Ra's and despite the trendy decor and atmosphere, really enjoy their sushi and sushi roll combinations. My preference is eating at the bar, but dining room service is fine. The spicy tuna roll and hamachi yellowtail tuna sushi are my favorites. Service is prompt and friendly and the bartenders do an exceptional job of mixing from an extensive custom drinks menu. Several special \"martini\" drinks are a joy to sip and the music sets a fun, upscale and sexy tone for this restaurant-bar combo."}
{"text":"Best place for sushi in Ahwatukee. Who doesn't love Ra? The last time I was there I tried their sauteed pepper appetizer. It was a little oily but was very interesting. Their sushi is amazing!"}
{"text":"My sister took me here for some sushi. She usually comes for happy hour and it has really good options (we missed happy hour but their regular menu was pretty good).  We ordered a couple of drinks and my sister ordered a clam dish while I ordered a poki bowl.  Her clam dish was good (had a lot of clams) but was a little on the salty side for me. My poki bowl was delicious! The fish were seasoned just right and the sauce that they put on it was delicious. I have to say I quite enjoyed my dish.  Prices were reasonable and service was alright. Would definitely come back and try their happy hour because it looked like everything was cheap enough to order multiple things to try."}
{"text":"This was a first stop on our recent trip to Vegas.  We wanted to eat Japanese food so we gave this place a try.  It has nice ambiance and decor.  And this isn't a typical Japanese restaurant.  It's more modern.  The sushi was not fresh.  And it took a long time for the sushi to come out to our table.  The 2 bento boxes we ordered were just ok.  Nothing special about them at all.  And everything is priced above what you would normally pay for sushi or bento boxes.  We're definitely not going to be return customers."}
{"text":"I do love the food here, although it is extremely Americanized Sushi. That's to be expected, but this isn't why I gave it two stars. I went for dinner and I thought I had entered a club. The music was loud and thumping, and we literally had to yell to have a conversation. It was during happy hour so I'm not sure if that is why, but all the same it didn't help the experience. I don't mind loud music, but it definitely didn't feel appropriate in this restaurant. I guess I'd go back, but maybe I'll just take someone I don't really want to talk to. ;-)"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome atmosphere, but the food it's very good. First off, my rolls had more rice and vegetable then fish. To be honest, I really didn't taste much lobster at all in my \"mango lobster.\" The other roll was the \"zonie\" and it was much of the same. Didn't taste much of the salmon."}
{"text":"I used to come to this location very often in the late 90's. And like it is still pretty much the same. Good sushi good service friendly atmosphere has a nice outdoor patio and is right in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We had great service and great food. The bartender was really helpful in choosing sushi rolls- we went with the rainbow roll and RACKING roll. Good stuff! Recommend sitting at the bar; get a saki bomber too."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch and ordered a few things on a late afternoon.  It's really dark in this restaurant and has too much red lighting.  Kind of tacky to me.  The set up is kind of odd too, I thought it was weird how the bar was sorta isolated from the restaurant, but i suppose it would be nice to sit at on a sunny day when people are dining in their outside patio.  Anyway, my BF and I were seated promptly along side a somewhat booth area on the other side of the sushi bar, right behind the bar.  The hostess was pretty nice; she told us we were able to sit wherever we liked- i'm a big fan of this option.  Their happy hour just started when we got there (4pm) so we ordered a few things on there.  $2 edemame was fine- not something you can easily mess up.  We also got a spicy yellowtail cut roll- this was alright; it wasn't bad or good- and some nigiri pieces.  From the regular menu we ordered salmon sashimi and some type of yellowtail dish served on a ginger/ponzu sauce or something like that.  The nigiri seriously looked like it was made by one of those buffet sushi machines and lacked any sushi chef skills whatsoever.  It also looked like it wasn't made to order.  My salmon sashimi was a horrible dish!!  I believe it was $9.50 for seven pieces of butchered ass cut sashimi.  OMG, the pieces were a sorry excuse for sashimi and I can't believed they served something like that.  Whoever cut them obviously lacked skill with the knife and is not a sushi chef.  I could've done a better job with a butter-knife.  Because of this horrible craftsmanship and  the not so fresh taste, i chose not to eat it and the waitress took it away.  The yellowtail dish was no different as far as cut was concerned, but it was masked by all the greens it was topped with.  The taste of the fish was edible, but i'm sure it  was because of the citrus sauce.  Service was ok.  It was a rather slow afternoon and things were mellow.  I don't know how busy this place gets, as it was my first time, but since it was slow our server was pretty attentive and made some suggestions.  I don't know if I would come back here, especially with all the other options in Vegas.  The prices are not bad for a strip restaurant, but you can definitely go off strip and find better quality/priced Japanese joints.  Though, I feel like I should maybe give them one more chance because I didn't really order any of their specialty/original dishes.  If i do come back, i'm definitely not opting for their sushi.  *Happy hour seems like it was a definite steal.  A lot of their appetizers, small plates, rolls, and nigiri were half price.  If you like to drink sake and martinis and such they have a pretty killer happy hour for that, too.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Happy hour Sushi and drinks can't be beat. Good selection of bottled beer including my favorite, IPA's. Staff friendly and attentive with a nice atmosphere. Good alternative to driving Tempe/Scottsdale to get your sushi fix"}
{"text":"My bff & I come here every time I visit her in AZ. We've had different things on the menu every time we go here the food never seems to go wrong, it's always excellent! I can't say the same about the service though. We stand in the front podium where we ALWAYS wait about 10 mins before being seated. The servers barely check on us every 15-20 mins while we sit there at our table.  Their rolls are always good, you can never go wrong! The sashimi is pretty good to but i'd prefer the rolls or rice plates over it any day. Not as fresh as comparison to other places I've gone to before. But I'm sure we'll be stopping by again the next time i'm in town visiting her."}
{"text":"This was my first time here! I enjoyed myself and the happy hour prices are very good!"}
{"text":"Ra sushi is a great place to come and get some sushi and socialize with friends. I have been to this place many times and always had great service from everyone in the restaurant. Plus they have really good happy hour."}
{"text":"It takes a great deal of perspective and mental channeling to give this place even a neutral review. However, I feel the positive deserves to be mixed in with the negative, because, overall, this place is decent during happy hour if you get past the club music, mediocre waitstaff, and often scantily clad clientele. It's even better when you're not planning on driving home.  Their happy hour is one of the best deals there is for sushi. With $1 sake and 1/2 of many rolls, nigiri and appetizers, it's worth eating here from 4-7 or for a late night sushi fix during reverse happy hour. While the sushi can take a very long time, a $4 martini usually gives me enough patience for the wait. The sushi itself is palatable, which is why it's only really worth it to go during happy hour. I wouldn't feel right paying full price for that quality.   As much as I try to block out the music and hormonal collegiate surroundings, it can be difficult. The music can be as distracting as the flaunted flesh everywhere. If reminding myself that cheap sushi and a good buzz is worth it doesn't work, I'll cut happy hour short and probably won't return for another few months. But for the purposes of this review, RA Sushi is enjoyable during the right time and with a flexible state of mind. Getting into that state of mind with a couple rounds of sake is my strategy."}
{"text":"I have to say the Happy Hour is a pretty good deal. 3PM-7PM. The most expensive thing on HH is $7, and even the cheaper portions are still filling. Unlike most other sushi bars, RA's HH has a little more choice rather than listing 3 or 4 things on their HH menu. Went for lunch today, and have to say our server was outstanding and very patient with our requests. After this experience I definitely want to return for more HH goodness. ;)"}
{"text":"Satisfying sushi in sin city...that's my best description of this place.  The atmosphere was super chic...and the food was very tasty...the rolls I was lucky enough to sample included the Viva Las Vegas Roll, the Tootsy Maki and the \"Ra\"llipop...the naming convention was cute...and pair those with sake bombs and you have a great pre-game plan prior to a night out on the town!!!  I had dinner there late...otherwise, I would have been all over that happy hour special.  If you're in the area and want a fun, chic place to hit, check this place out."}
{"text":"It started off bad because the hostess was SUPER rude! We had a reservation and the place was nearly empty yet she made us stand up front while they \"prepared a table.\" 10 minutes later we were finally saved by Rob who was an awesome waiter. He asked if we had been taken care of then got us into a nice booth. He was super attentive and friendly. The food was amazing and Rob really saved the experience."}
{"text":"Asian cuisine franchises... I hate them!  My friend use to work here as one of the sushi chefs so I was obligated to stop on by to wish him a successful career.  While our buddy took care of us and served us the most beautiful cuts of fish, everything else here is pretty generic.  By all means, the fish is delicious and fresh but for the price, what are we really getting here?  The portions are on the smaller side considering how much you're paying.  Sure the atmosphere is great and the decor is gorgeous but in the end, you're just really paying to say you went to RA.  Even the servers can be a bit on the snobbish uppidy side.  Take your money and support the small local businesses around town!  One positive thing I will say about RA is that I do love the Umami Punch.  Great cocktail to share with a significant other."}
{"text":"I stopped by myself on a Sunday at about 4 in the afternoon and it was understandably deserted (although several other restaurants in the immediate area seemed to be booming). The sushi bar itself was HUGE; I can imagine that there is room for a dozen, or more, sushi chefs working at a time. There were 3 chefs on duty and neither was Asian, which always makes me wonder at a sushi place. I ordered a fusion sushi roll with mango salsa and found the portion and taste to be good. Although I had to ask for wasabi and ginger; a first at a sushi place for me."}
{"text":"Not the absolute best sushi in town, but by far not the worst.  We came for happy hour and had the spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail, and spicy tuna rolls, and we had some pineapple cheese wontons for appetizer (the wontons were delicious).  What stood out to me the most here, though, were the atmosphere and the drinks.  We sat at the bar and had a great bartender, who watched the basketball game with us and had some excellent recommendations for drinks (pink drinks are the best, if you're man enough to try them!).  I especially liked the Dragon Bite and the Shiso Naughty.  The sushi is pretty middle-of-the-road, but the happy hour pricing makes it reasonable for what you get.  Personally I prefer other sites for sushi, but the bar and bartender will likely keep me coming back whenever there's a good game on.  Great alternative to a sports bar."}
{"text":"Great food and service..Vegetarian dumplings a must and chicken katsu was crispy and cooked to perfection. It's normally a little different between same franchise locations..this is just as good as its north scottsdale brother!"}
{"text":"Tried Ra Sushi for the first time this week and I already want to go back. Highly recommend this place for a family dinner, me and my family shared a number of platters and none of the platters dissapointed. BEST CALAMARI EVER, you definitely have to try it if you go. I hardly order sushi so I wouldn't trust my judgement entirely but I really liked the sushi I had here. Also they definitely aren't stingy with their alcohol, for an $8 drink (we came during happy hour) you might just leave the place a little buzzed. Our waitress and the staff were very exuberant and friendly I'd say 5 stars on customer service. Only recommendation I would give the company based on my experience is to change their chicken teriyaki dish. It needed more flavor and I didn't enjoy the selection of vegetables it came with."}
{"text":"This is a rapidly expanding chain restaurant, with the emphasis on being trendy. Per its web site, \"the music is pumping, the mood is upbeat and the atmosphere is as stimulating as a big bite of wasabi.\"  **The Menu Sushi, plus an assortment of other dishes: teriyaki, noodles, katsu. The sushi emphasis is on rolls with all sorts of stuff mixed in. How about a Viva Las Vegas roll: an artificial crab and cream cheese roll, battered and fried, then topped with spicy tuna, crab mix, and lotus root, THEN topped with bbq sauce and fried spinach flakes.  **The Atmosphere The design is simple, with lots of light wood and a black industrial ceiling. Light is provided by a number of blood red globes. Music, at a moderate volume, consisted mostly of blues and rock.  The sushi bar is poorly designed. While the sushi chefs try to be friendly, the bar is so deep that it was difficult to be heard over the music. I view this as a major flaw.  **The Meal Since this was my first meal here, I opted for some basic sushi choices. They all suffered from a basic flaw: rice that was too soft, and lacked flavor. Not a good start. Now, on to the particulars:      * hamachi (yellowtail). The fish was fresh enough but, even given the mild nature of hamachi, was bland.     * unagi (barbecued eel): The eel was barely warm. The sauce was watery.     * flying fish roe with a quail egg: Good. The rich egg flavor and the crunchy roe made the rice's deficiencies less important.     * amaebi (raw sweet shrimp): The shrimp were fresh enough, but lacked flavor. On request, the heads are fried. No tempura batter was used, which I thought odd but not bad. The heads were crisp, but overcooked and somewhat dry. Nonetheless, RA Sushi get points for even offering this selection.  **Summary The sushi was very disappointing. Go for the atmosphere. Maybe the more exotic rolls are good. Just don't go for regular sushi.  **The Bill The meal was $44, plus tax and tip."}
{"text":"RA is a chain restaurant and being such I was surprised that they do not offer better choices for gluten free options. One cannot even eat their sushi. They use white flour in the rice to keep in from sticking. I have gone to many different sushi places and no one else has ever done this. I won't be returning to RA for this reason. On top of this they are pricey. The service was so so and could be better."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale visiting college friends with the New Boy and celebrating the New Year holiday.  On New Year day, we dragged ourselves out of bed around 2:00 or 3:00 and heading to Mill Ave because we were STARVING.  Ra seemed like a good choice, so we struck in and found ourselves sitting on the back patio--the music inside was just WAY too loud. Our waitress made sake-bomb-action happen, which was a blessed relief. That was the best part of the experience.  The sushi was *ok*, the service sucked, and the ambiance was weird. We waited for over 30 minutes for our bill...I was about to walk out without paying just because I was tired of the place.  The overly-loud music varied between classic rock and dance music...they should have just left it on the dance music and left Cheap Trick and Foreigner at home."}
{"text":"I come here all the time because the happy hour is so great! The reason I give this location only 3 stars is due to their waitress Monique. Every single time she serves my party, she is nothing but rude. She moves very slow and clearly does not care about her guests. She never ever smiles, but is usually very nice at the end when she is dropping off the check (probably because she wants a good tip). We have complained time and time again about her attitude and service but clearly nothing has changed. Most recently, we had received our edamame last, and when we asked her if she forgot about it, she replied with \"do you want me to print out the ticket and show you the ticket time?\" in the rudest tone ever. We were with some of the head people at one of the upscale restaurants in Old Town and they were absolutely mortified by her behavior and service.   However, the only reason this location is getting more than 1 or 2 stars is because of 3 people that make our experience worth it! Matt is the best server we have ever had. He is extremely personable and genuinely cares about his guests. Additionally, one of the sushi chefs (can't remember his name but he talks about going to Alaska in the summers) is one of our favorite people! He is so happy and always holds great conversation. Lastly, the waitress named Gwenivere is also more than sweet. She always remembers us and is very attentive and friendly.   If this location were to get rid of Monique, it would definitely receive 5 stars."}
{"text":"Another decent Valley sushi restaurant.  Nothing to write home about, but it will satifsy a sushi craving."}
{"text":"I went here on the last stop of a pub crawl, which had been pretty seemless before going to RA.  Everything had been pre-arranged -- they knew that our group was coming and offered to provide us with happy hour prices during our visit.  However, when we got there, the people working at the time had no idea we were coming, had no where to sit our big group together, and weren't offering any drink/food specials. And on top of all of that, everyone from the hostess to the waitress had a stank attitude about it!  Really?  Turned off by their lack of organization and the fact that they had attitudes, we left -- all 20 of us -- and took our business to Z'Tejas, where they were more than happy to accommodate us.    I've been to RA's Ahwatukee location several times, and while RA's sushi in general is not stellar, the service is at least good.  I won't be visiting this Tempe location EVER again."}
{"text":"Many of times I've overheard someone in passing talk about how \"RA has the best sushi, ever!\"  I've only eaten here once. It was one of the first places I ate after moving here from L.A. and man was I dissapointed. The first bite I took into the my tuna sashimi, I was greeted with a nice frozen center. Nothing like fresh...uhhhh....frozen sushi. I sent that back.   It's horribly overpriced too, not to mention douche/boob job central. I'd never pay that much for shitty sushi again."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place that is like a club and restaurant at the same time, you got to come to RA Sushi. The restaurant is dark. The music is soooo loud, you cannot hear the person next to you.   This place is another lame attempt of a trendy sushi restaurant. The selection of sushi is disgusting. I do not know how the came up with their menu. Maybe they drew ingredients out of a hat and decided to roll it up in rice and seaweed.   The one thing I was looking forward to was the Cinnamon Tempura Ice Cream. This dessert was the biggest let down. The raspberry glaze they cover it with is the nastiest thing I have ever tasted. It was so bitter. It made the whole dessert inedible.   I will never be back to this location or any of their other ones. I have no idea how they stay in business or open new locations."}
{"text":"I was felling pretty bold and decided to step out of my comfort zone and try something new. As soon as my friends and I walked in, there was a very good vibe I was getting from the restaurant. I loved the decor inside the restaurant it was very modern and sort of rock and roll-ish. The host got us a table right away and was very nice.They had music playing throughout the restaurant which I loved. Right after we were seated our waitress came to our table.                   Our waitress was very helpful and made sure to answer any questions we had for her. She explained what everything was that we were interested in ordering and also suggested her favorite dishes. The food came out very quickly and our waitress made sure we had evrything we needed. Once we got the food she ckecked up on us to see if everything we ordered was correct and that we were enjoying it.          I am not a fan of sea food but, I was there to try something new. I decided on the california rolls and at first I was a little hesitant to eat them. They looked delicious but I knew there was crab in it. I got some soy sauce, dipped my california roll into it, and took the first bite. In complete shock I loved it. The taste was so different and that was exactly what I was looking for. This was a great experiance and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for amazing food!"}
{"text":"i've really tried to like RA over the years because it is so conveniently located, but they never quite measure up.  If you are looking for traditional preparations, this is not the place to go.     A simple example - I was there the other day and ordered a spicy tuna roll, and a  spicy salmon roll.  The happy hour prices were great, but the rolls were VERY heavy on the rice (which wasn't quite done) and not spicy at all.  The spicy salmon had a bit of flavor but I don't really care for preparations such as RA's which use mayonnaise.  The spicy tuna was bland in the extreme, and was simply a chewing exercise.  When I mentioned the blandness of the rolls to the sushi chef, he indicated that the management had recently changed the spicy tuna recipe from one that was spicier, but which had also contained cilantro - which I would not have cared for in my roll.     Reminds me why I stopped eating here before...."}
{"text":"Dear Ra:  Get over yourself.   Just sayin'. - Alicia"}
{"text":"Cream cheese in rolls. Loud, obnoxious music. You have to scream to talk. This is the epitome of trendy. Ra doesn't serve sushi. They serve pretentious hype.   Give me authentic. Give me style. Give me an experience that doesn't make my ears ring.   Simply, there are far superior places to go for sushi.   Oh, but what if you don't go for the food? Are you going for the social scene? The drinks? To be with the in-crowd? Oh, then ignore my rating. I'm only concerned with the fish."}
{"text":"Excellent place for happy hour and dinner! Happening ambience and bar and wait staff are ALWAYS incredibly nice and on top of it!! This is our fave sushi location!"}
{"text":"Decent food, but a bit on the pricey side with smallish portions.  I guess happy hour would make this place worth the trip.  Its also in the mall.  Really loud on a Saturday with people doing Sake bombs and blasting dance music.  Coming from LA its sort of surprising not to see decent Sushi joints in every stripmall, but hey different strokes, I guess."}
{"text":"Been here numerous times and is consistently one of the best places for Sushi in Vegas. Great environment and friendly staff.   The Viva Vegas roll is hands down the best tasting sushi roll I have ever had. No other imitations from other restaurants live up to it.  I have had many different types of sushi here over the years and have not been turned off by any of them, and I'm picky when it comes to sushi. They are all very good.   If you are looking for All You Can Eat then look elsewhere as it is not offered. However, they do have an excellent Happy Hour around lunchtime with excellent offerings including the Viva Vegas Roll which is a rather filling.  My number one go-to place for sushi."}
{"text":"Cheap, poor quality sushi. Go if you just lost the rest of your money at the tables."}
{"text":"It's good sushi. The first place we had sushi a year and a half ago. And still one of our top favs. Kind loud, it's a rock n roll sushi bar, duh. Eat outside if you plan on talking our get cozy with your friends."}
{"text":"Food: Good. I tried the teriyaki chicken yaki udon which was very tasty. Nice presentation also. The food in here smelled and looked good, I wouldn't mind returning to try other dishes.  Price: Not bad at all. My dish was around $13 and most other meat dishes were $15 and up. Good portion for price though.  Service: Very friendly and attentive.   Atmosphere: Dark, intimate and trendy! Wasn't too crowded when we came in here but definitely a good place for groups.  Location: Located at Fashion Show Mall"}
{"text":"Definitely a can't miss for happy hour!  1/2 price appetizers and sushi, such a good deal (especially for the Strip). The best part is, the \"1/2 price\" food isn't something lame like \"just\" edamame or \"california rolls.\" You can actually order ALL the menu appetizers, but pay 1/2 the price! The food quality is great! I've eaten here numerous times for happy hour and been totally happy (quality wasn't definitely not cut in half).  Love being able to sit in the restaurant and order happy hour and not be stuck in the bar (shoot out to that)!  Check it out if you're on the Strip (the vibe is cool at night as well as during the day)."}
{"text":"Please don't make the same mistake as we did and judge this book by its cover. Sounds and looks like a 'good' sushi spot, but it's anything but. We were starving and couldn't bring ourselves to finish the food. Everything was bland and tasted like clorox... fish wasn't fresh to say the least. The best tasting dish we ordered was the teriyaki beef bowl for the kids - that's not saying much... grilled steak with teriyaki sauce. The cocktails tasted like free casino drinks. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"RA was OK.  We swung in there while stranded at the Phoenix airport for a night.  Did the half price happy hour and it was quick, cheap, and good.  Not amazing sushi, but hey, or half price you're getting more than what you pay for!  Check out RA for yourself!"}
{"text":"WOW, that's the best way to describe this experience.  I haven't been in a while because of the prolonged delay and poor quality of food delivered last time.  But tonight, not only was the Nigiri downright amazing but so also was the Miso Soup and Seared Tuna.  In addition, I believe its more than worth pointing out that I was BEYOND impressed by Isaac at the bar tonight.  He exhibited some of the most profound and professional customer service abilities I have ever experienced in a restaurant.  He was very polite, extremely attentive and above all else, truly exhibited that he cared.  I plan to come back much more often after this experience.  Thank you Isaac for a great experience and thank you Ra Sushi for a great meal."}
{"text":"Our first night in Vegas our daughter wanted Sushi. We decided on RA because it was close. At 8:30 we we're seated right away, outside. We ordered 2 apps, 2 salads and California Rolls. One app came, then one salad and the sushi. I sat waiting for my Asian salad for another10 minutes or so while my husband and daughter ate their dinner. No word as to why it was late or whether the other app would arrive. BUT, we were pretty chill and when it did arrive it was really good! My daughter ordered more sushi. My husband enjoyed his Tuna Salad. My Asian chicken Salad was very fresh. The vinaigrette tasty. Shrimp and Chicken apps were delicious too."}
{"text":"The food was incredible and the price was great. The service was well done. Our server Kyle was attentive but not over so. It was bit chilly for me. I will just bring a jacket the next time."}
{"text":"This is best sushi restaurant I've ever been to. All the staff were very friendly and we were waited on as soon as we entered the restaurant. I ordered the chili shrimp roll and the roll is the best sushi roll I have ever had in my life! It contains crab, shrimp, jalepeno, cilantro, spicy mayo and sirracha hot sauce. You will not be disappointed. We were so satisfied with this restaurant that we decided to come back again. I'm from Maryland and there's also a location in Towson so I will be visiting there when I return home."}
{"text":"My first time eating here and the food is definitely 5 stars. I knocked off a star for their customer service. The lady didn't set our table and forgot an extra pair of utensils for me, and when clearing the plates she spilled soy sauce on my boyfriend's shorts, and when we were done, we had to walk up to pay since she never checked up on us.  Pros: -delicious sushi -great selection of special rolls -the las vegas roll is a must try -the happy hours are amazing -pretty interior and clean design -food came out fast and fresh  Cons: -poor customer service  Overall: I'll definitely eat here again if I am craving sushi in Vegas :) Hopefully the next time I visit, their customer service will be better."}
{"text":"The Awahtukee Ra is fabulous. Avoid the Mill location (unless you're just going to drink).  Overall I would order the non-sushi, more Americanized dishes for a great meal experience. The rolls weren't very large or flavorful.  BUT, their Happy Hour is fantastic and the plating is aesthetically admirable. One dish I particularly enjoyed were the mussels in this flavorful garlic and leek broth. I ordered extra white rice on the side and make a little soup and was stuffed. Super filling and delectable.  Also, their sashimi is nice, which I always find is the mark of fresh fish at a restaurant..  Happy and pleased. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Well, This review is based on the sushi alone --- so 1 star. If I was reviewing the bar - 5 stars!  Anyway --- If you actually enjoy RA Sushi, I wonder if you're only eating Vegas Rolls and potsickers. I know your type: New to sushi, want to get drunk with your friends and pretend to actually enjoy raw fish. I know, I know...you're in college and it's Mill Ave.   I am fine to get trashed here, I LOVE their bartenders and inventive drinks...but the food is nast.   That's RA in a nutshell."}
{"text":"So i came to celebrate with some friends & the waitress was really rude. She didn't even come ask \"if we needed or wanted anything to drink.\" Until, her manager came by she came to our table and asked & was still rude about it. And when the manager came to ask if we wanted anything I started to tell him our drink orders and he interrupt me and says hold on I need to drop this off and walks off! And then the waitress comes back! Also since they wouldn't come to ask if we needed anything I walked up to the bar to ask for one and they said they will send a waiter! Pretty much it took a U.S. About 40mins to get our first drinks after we tried to ask 3 times!"}
{"text":"Came here with friends who like the place, but it was really just ok.  The food was good, though not great, and the service all but sucked.  Sat at the bar to avoid waiting and to feel the breeze from outside.  It was dirty, and no one bothered to wipe it down.  By the time our food came we were the only ones left seated at the bar, and we were pretty much left to fend for ourselves.  We managed to waive down our server/ bartender to get a fourth plate for our group of four, but had to scavenge for soy sauce dispensers that weren't empty.  Add a crab roll being brought instead of the nigiri we ordered (they did end up charging us for the nigiri instead of the roll, but we had to point out the discrepancy, and still didn't get what we'd actually ordered).  Potstickers were very good.  Salmon was pretty good, as was whatever roll was basically a Philly roll with avocado and mango sauce on top.  Crab roll was OK but had lots of rice- nigiri would have been better to taste it.  I don't recommend the mango sauce on rolls without avocado- it just seemed too sweet to me, but my friend liked it so if you like sweet sushi then it'd be good.  The guy was nice enough, and maybe it was just a bad day, but all in all not what I expect when I'm dropping enough cash to do AYCE at other sushi spots.  Would consider coming for happy hour, otherwise I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Had the sushi and bento box here ! Fun eating here with friend. Surprisingly authentic Japanese food ."}
{"text":"This place used to be way better. Ordered 4 rolls off of the happy hour menu. The quality is just not there anymore, additionally the place was not that busy and after 1 hour we never got 1 roll that we ordered. It was pretty ridiculous to seat there for 1.5 hours and not get a simple 4 roll order?! Never coming back."}
{"text":"So many pros & cons. Where to start! The scallop surprise appetizer was amazing! A must try. I also had the ahi tuna tacos, which were very tasty. I had a coupon from the e-mail club, otherwise it's unlikely that I would ever eat here. The music is obnoxious, and there are always some people who had too much to drink.  Ra needs to open a second, low key location in the Burbs away from the craziness of the Strip for locals to enjoy."}
{"text":"Went to eat lunch on Tuesday, 12/22/14 and a roach crawled on the table and then after seeing that one I also saw another roach on the floor by the table. The restaurant is very dark and had a bad odor/stench as well. I would say it smelled of urine or a dirty bathroom."}
{"text":"???????2???????fashion show????Microsoft Store?Apple Store????????????????????????????????????strip???????????????????????????????????????????...????????"}
{"text":"Amazing fun!! Our waiter Patrick was on point! Very helpful and a great asset! The sushi options were fantastic! Try the Ra\"ckin' roll! Amazing. Great wasabi btw, so many disappointing wasabi sauces out there! We will be back!"}
{"text":"RA sushi is an ok place. We had an urge for some sushi. We got here a little after lunch. We originally wanted a buffet. But this was the place we decided. We eventually got to sit down at the bar. It took a while for the bartender came over to help us out. When she finally got there we were ready to order.   I ended up getting a bento box and a new zealand roll. The bento box included miso soup. I love miso soup. The roll was good. It had scallops and kiwi on it. It was a mix of sweet and sushi. I liked it. It was funny as we left we noticed that the restaurant had a booth for a dj. I guess they must have live music during the evening."}
{"text":"This place had pretty good sushi.  I really liked the fact that it didn't put a hole in my pocket.  I was craving sushi BAD and wanted to try out a place without having to spend a fortune and I had came to right place.  They have happy hour from 3-7pm I believe and I got variety of rolls for really cheap and tasted pretty good.  I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi I have ever had.  Not fresh and certainly not prepared well.  Fingerprints all over the plate.  Avoid at all costs.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to be sick soon."}
{"text":"Reading the reviews below. Maybe you need to go to this restaurant with loud babies like I did. The service was prompt and attentive. I think they were trying to get us out of the restaurant as quickly as possible. We ordered about 5 different things, teriyaki chicken, tuna roll, california roll, king crab roll, soft shell crab appetizer, all delicious. But one. The soft shell crab. It was obviously over cook. The waitress tried to say it wasn't over cooked that it was a black pepper they sprinkle on the crab. But we sent it back and it came out properly the second time.   Really the servers look like there in college and just kind of huddle together waiting for the day to be over. It's a shame the service is so crappy. The food is very good."}
{"text":"Great happy hour pricing here.  Very sleek decor with black and red.    In the Fashion Show mall, and facing the Las Vegas Strip.  It has great music and some rolls that are unique to RA.   The happy hour pricing is super low.  At other times, the pricing seems high for what you get.  Their roll with mangoes is delicious, and I believe it was called the Monkey Roll.  Service was professional but the servers seemed very rushed and overloaded."}
{"text":"Great happy hour, never got to try their drinks, but the food items on the happy hour menu was great, and on the lower side for Vegas.  The hostess was cold and not very friendly but our waitress was a sweetheart, and the food was yummy. We will return for drinks next time we're in town."}
{"text":"Always a fun place--we prefer the patio, even on the hottest days. It's in the shade. Check in on Foursquare for complimentary edamame appetizer."}
{"text":"Good looking menu. Inside is very loud. The food was great and an early evening drink and appetizer is ideal.  It is more for the younger crowd, I am  60, but still a very nice getaway.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"We had the sashimi, and a roll.  The food is great.   We have gone there twice and really liked it.  This place is in Fashion Square mall, and is way better than I would expect for a mall sushi place.  Nice atmosphere.  Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I would call this a trendy, but low-end quality Japanese place.  Everything on the menu is just plain average, that's all.  Happy Hour is just okay.  All the location's decor is nice and modern with trendy crowds."}
{"text":"Awesome chirashi bowl is the best! And Sara was a great server ! Great happy hour and $5 Monday martinis"}
{"text":"Ra is much like the Japanese food you would find in the dumpster of a better Japanese restaurant, except that dumpster food got frozen and reheated two months later. The chicken teriyaki resembled chicken teriyaki in that it was chicken in a brown sauce, but all similarities ended there. Somehow they find a way to make the actual chicken both rubbery and soggy, which is mystifying in its own right. The sushi is underwhelming with old fish and stale rice, and the only thing that made the experience bearable was the admirable service. I wished, in the end, our wonderful waiter had a job at a better restaurant."}
{"text":"Had a sudden craving for sushi and came upon this place last night. The food was good and the bartender was even better. I forgot what I ordered to drink but it was was absolutely delicious and refreshing. Two thumbs up for sure. The back bar in the patio was super chill, I'd be back forsure. :)"}
{"text":"okay food for the price during happy hour. go during happy hour!   i tried most of their appetizers and sushi rolls. the only foods i liked were the blue crab cakes, lobster rolls, baked scallops, and the \"viva las vegas\" roll. most of the sushi rolls were okay, nothing special. service is pretty slow though."}
{"text":"Go frequently. I like to sit at the bar. Sam knows my order by heart. Hot mess and crunchy shrimp tempura with soy paper. AMAZING FOOD AMAZING SERVICE."}
{"text":"Happy hour! Pineapple cheese wontons, viva vegas roll, yellowtail nigiri and rainbow roll! Good food, good price!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Saturday! Wasn't very busy so my boyfriend and I got seated quickly. Our waiter was very attentive and let us look over the menu without feeling rushed.   I ordered the Philly roll and my boyfriend got the Cali Bento w/ Katsu Chicken; we also shared the Las Vegas roll. All tasted yummy.   (side note: tried to eat the ring thing on top of the LV roll but it was really hard so I don't know if I was suppose to do that lol)  Anyway, service won me over! Food was normal. From the friendly waiter to the hostess who constantly refilled out waters, we enjoyed our time at RA Sushi! 3.5/5!"}
{"text":"I came here for the happy hour which actually does offer decent prices on their \"rolls\" and drinks, The food tasted great and the service was really good for how busy they were. The only thing I didn't like is that the rolls are smaller than any other sushi place I have gone to down here, so it kinda took away the value from happy hour."}
{"text":"I got very bad service here. I work close by and ordered a vegetable tempura bento box to go. The woman on the phone I ordered from double checked with me to make sure the order was correct, but when I went to pick up the order was incorrect. I didn't realize this until I got back to work and ended up having to go back to correct the order. When I went up to the bar to ask a girl to fix my order she gave me a pretentious reluctant attitude. I waited a few minutes and because at this point I'm running out of time for lunch I asked if they could hurry and I just want to be seated and eat in. Again the girl at the bar was reluctant and said ok and didn't even offer to sit me. She just walks off! So I seat myself out side and wait. I happen to look over at the bar and see the second waitress assigned to my table just standing, leaning against the counter on her phone. I see a manager notice her and barely reprimanded her. I look over again and the other girl at the bar gives me a dirty look. Finally the waitress gives us our food and never comes by again. I did not leave a tip and I'm never going back again. Number one, please make an extra effort to get to go orders correct. Number two, you have a job, be thankful and do it with pride. Treat your customers with respect and actually give them real service."}
{"text":"Trying to make this my must stop every time I come to Vegas. I randomly found this place when I went to EDC this summer that just past and I fell in love. I got the salmon rice bowl, it was a bunch of salmon sashimi with rice, cucumbers, and a really delicious sauce. I loved it so much and it got full with leftovers, since it's raw fish and I don't trust leaving it in the hotel, it just sucks I can't take it to go unless I eat it quickly *sad face. That first time I got it, it was from the lunch menu, but when I came back a few months later luckily they said they were able to make me it for dinner. Weird how it's something on the lunch menu and not on the dinner though? And when I asked if I still got the miso soup (included on the lunch menu) the second time I came, the waitress told me it shouldn't come with it because at the time it was dinner hours... but it's not on the dinner menu whatsoever, it's on the lunch. I don't know how to explain it. It was just odd to me that whole situation. I told her \"oh okay then.\" Yet she still came back with it after her lowkey attitude for asking.  As for service, the first time I came the waitress I had was very sweet and super attentive. I got everything I needed to enjoy my meal before heading out to EDC that evening. The second time, I was kind of disappointed because our server literally took a very long time to take our order, to get us water... and when I needed something she was nowhere to be found, for such a long period of time my boyfriend had to ask the busser next to us to get us a side of spicy mayo (thanks dude!). That second server was probably annoyed of me asking for that miso soup earlier lol. I don't even think she was busy because the place was pretty empty when I came in. I will still return hoping to receive the service I got the very first time, hopefully they have less snobby servers in the near future. Otherwise I don't think I can handle it. I would probably just want to take it to go back to my hotel to eat it instead just to avoid having attitude on the side with my meal haha."}
{"text":"Great lunch and happy hour specials but food was just eh. Not a big fan of the sushi and I even had to send the spicy shrimp roll back because the flavoring was just off and didn't seem right. Also, the house salad that was included on the lunch menu was in the center of the plate but looked more like a garnish. The smell of this place was just off too. The one in downtown Scottsdale has a nicer ambience but I've never been in love with their food."}
{"text":"Good place for sushi and we walk here as well from our condo....love the convenience plus it's good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"i've been to Ra a few times in Arizona and California. the chain is generally located in major strip malls so it's one of those places i repeatedly stumble on while shopping or trying to kill time before a late movie.   i think Ra wants to be known as a late night hot spot as opposed to a place you can find good sushi. there's always a great patio to socialize and people watch. the service is slow and confusing because you seem to end up with about 2 or 3 different people waiting on you. the last time i was here, waitress #2 poured our sake to the point where it overflowed. unless licking sake off the table is an ancient Japanese tradition i don't know about, that's pretty crap service. as for the sushi, it doesn't stand out at all. maybe the music made it so i couldn't taste my food. yeah, it's loud to the point where both your eardrums and your taste buds are numb.  like everyone else says, go for the Happy Hour and hanging out. but take only those friends who have perfect hearing and really loud voices."}
{"text":"Sauool was the best sushi bar chef we have ever met..he was so friendly and made the best sushi ever... Thanks for making our experience awesome"}
{"text":"My bf and I came to Ra while on our vacation to AZ. It was so delicious and the service was great! All the people there Are very nice! If I come back to AZ I'll defanetly end my trip this way again!!"}
{"text":"We met my cousin at RA Sushi Bar Restaurant for lunch.  Honestly, none of us was impressed with the food.  Have nothing to recommend food wise.  Sushi did not taste fresh.    Can say that the ambiance was nice and service was okay.  With so many great choices in Las Vegas, I'd say the chances of my returning are not very good."}
{"text":"Happy hour from 3pm-7pm Monday through Saturday, need I say more?  On the happy hour menu: $2 sake and around $4-$8 for rolls, sashimi and other appetizers. The rolls aren't that great. I will tell you what is because I'm a heffa like that and tried just about everything on the happy hour menu.   Get multiple orders of the sesame wings. That was the favorite dish at our table. Big, succulent wings that were a little crispy just how I like them. And that sesame sauce was so good we took some to go with our leftovers. Another favorite was the fried shrimp, calamari and albacore sashimi. The spicy tuna on crispy rice was just ok. I would also forgo the short ribs. They were NOT good.  If you're looking for a dinner destination before going out to the clubs, this is a good place for something fun, cheap, easy and light (you can't get too stuffed before you put your freakum dresses on 'kna mean?)."}
{"text":"I've been to this sushi restaurant twice, once for my best friend's birthday and the other time this past New Year's Day. Their food is unbelievable delicious. We went there during happy hour and went sushi crazy. We tried almost everything on the menu and most of the appetizers. D E L I C I O U S. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that's in town and loves sushi!"}
{"text":"We went on a very early afternoon lunch and the food was fabulous. It was fresh and inside was quiet, of course we were the only ones there, but the staff were obnoxious and rude. We got snuffed at when we walked in, the waitress wouldn't look at us, and was slow to bring us drinks.  The only reason it got 4 stars was because of the sushi was so good and different from what I'm used to."}
{"text":"RA is sort of like sushi for people who want to say they go to RA.  I don't know how else to put that.  I came here for reverse happy hour the other night after not having been to RA in more than a year.  I used to go to the RA on Mill Ave in college, but I have not really seen a need to go to RA since.  It is just OK.  It is nothing special.  It is a little overpriced for the quality, portion-sizes and service.  The sushi is just... meh.  The one menu item I did enjoy quite a bit on my last visit was the Crispy Onion Albacore, which was 5 pieces of seared Albacore in a garlic ponzu sauce.  It was pretty weird, though.  There were no pieces of crispy onions on it, as indicated on the menu.  There were only a couple wontons on top.  Strange!  RA is a little too young, too funky, too not-so-me.  The clientele at this location seems to mostly be young twenties, but maybe that is because I have only been to this location after 7 p.m.  Still, on date night it is convenient to go to a movie and then the reverse happy hour, which is moderately priced.  At least until Pita Jungle gets their reverse happy hour going next door, there's a chance you might see me at RA again."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, the star rating is about 90% due to the fact that on Tuesdays you can get lunch meals for Buy 1, Get 1 free.    That makes eating here a whole star better!  The lunch sushi and lunch sashimi meals are a great value.   I've never been a huge fan of RA.  I can't stand loud music.  I prefer soft background music when I am eating out.  If I notice the music, it is too loud.  \"Get off my lawn, Punks!!!\"  Yeah, I am getting old.  The service was good.  The food was... well... Arizona sushi.    Will I come here again?  You bet your bottom dollar.  On a Tuesday, that is."}
{"text":"Sebastian, Sushi Chef, excelled at creating our special order sushi for our late lunch! YUMMMMMMY!"}
{"text":"My friends wanted to come here because theyve been to Ra when they were in the east coast, so we decided to have a bite to eat here before we guzzled down large amounts of Fat Tuesdays LOL. We were staying at Trump Tower, so it was pretty easy to get to since Ra is in Fashion Show Mall.   It was slightly empty when we went in but i noticed all the cool upscale-like decor. It had a nice reddish/dark theme. Pretty laid back. They had a bento box lunch special, but unfortunately, it was only until 3pm. Instead we ordered off the happy hour menu--  Sweet Onion Salmon: salmon was cut thinly, but pretty good with sauce Lobster Spring Rolls: only 3, super crunchy, but couldnt taste much of the mango Calamari: not too memorable , but filling Viva Las Vegas Roll: typical sushi roll, average, but the plating was gorgeous  All of these dishes were reasonably priced (considering vegas $$), and the food came out fast and hot. Waitress came back to check up on us a lot and gave us boxes to take things to go for our friends.   Will come back to try other dishes, hopefully better ones"}
{"text":"My friend and I went to RA, last night. We were seated and sat there for at least 15 minutes without any waiter or waitress acknowledging us or even asking us for at least water. We stayed for another 5 minutes watching waiters and waitresses pass us. So we got up and left VERY upset. Won't be going back with that kind of service."}
{"text":"Average sushi.  Young crowd.  Good happy hour.  Much better sushi can be had elsewhere, but it can be quite the swinging scene if you are into that sort of thing.  I used to come here when I was in college if that tells you anything..."}
{"text":"Great place for Happy Hour and so conveniently located on the strip! Happy Hour is pretty much everyday except Sunday and from 3-7pm which is a long time for Vegas. Most places I've been too are Monday to Thursday and only for a few short hours so this was a bonus for us. It was pretty packed when we came and the hostess wasn't all that great. The waitress was cool though. They have a Happy Hour menu with lots of things on it, cheap $2 sake and a few other things. We ordered a whole bunch of stuff but my favorite has to be the Viva Las Vegas Roll yum! Get that if you're here. I highly recommend the Seared Ahi Tuna as well. The calamari was soggy to me and a bit bland, don't get that. Love the presentation and fresh selections!"}
{"text":"Living in the middle of the desert.. Las Vegas to be exact.. you learn very quicky that there are 5 star sushi joints. And those are the ones you need to go to. I love RA Sushi, and the Las Vegas location(service-wise) wasn't all that when I lived there, and it wasn't all that when we paid a visit in the middle of March, but it's fresh (^_^) I honestly thought it was so-so when I lived here..but 3 years later.. there seemed to be an improvement!   Let's get down to it. RA is located within the Fashion Mall at the end of the \"new\" Strip (Spring Mountain Rd and S Las Vegas Blvd, across from the Wynn & Encode hotels). Therefore it can either be really crowded or really empty. Frankly, it's usually in between..during weekends there is usually some sort of music being played at the bar, and it reverberates through the ENTIRE restaurant. Meaning diners have to listen to he latest hip hop or whatever the DJ is playing. Great if it's a younger crowd, not so much if it's full of older folks (and yes, age varies by day and time too!). Parking can be found behind the Fashion Mall in an underground garage. It's pretty spacious down there, but people drive like morons so watch out! The ambience of RA is..bathed in an annoying red light. Okay, at first I thought \"OMG how cool...\" and then when I tried to read the menu, AND take photos of my food. I had to enlist the help of my flash to get clear photos!! It's he lighting I'd expect of I was going on a date to a restaurant I guess.   The bar has plenty of alcohol to whip up numerous drinks, and oh so many sakes, wines, bottled beers and . Because sushi and sake bombs, it goes hand in hand. I'm quite the picky eater when it comes to sushi, as it is raw fish, so better safe than sorry right? At least RA has fresh fishies on my plate! RA has 5 types of sushi. Maki, Sashimi, Nigiri, and then hand rolls and specialty rolls (only found at RA locations). Personally, I prefer the specialty rolls and their Maki choices. The shrimp tempura hand roll has a lovely crunch, and fresh chunks of shrimp inside.  When browsing the menu, I usually go for what I know. My 1st time eating here was back in 2010 when I first moved to Nevada, and I was still relatively \"new\" to sushi. Now it's a staple. The latest trip provided me with 3 or 4 different rolls. I chose the Vegas Roll, Rainbow Roll, Avocado and Cucumber Rolls, and the garlic edamame. The Vegas rolls were fresh, full of crab and cream cheese mix that played up the crab flavor and wasn't overly strong from the cream cheese.  The tempura decoration on top was tasty too haha. The avocado and cucumber rolls were both fresh, but the chunk of cucumber where difficult to bite through because they were pretty thick..not to mention I still had to get through the layer of rice..not an easy roll to eat in just one bite :(. California roll is standard at ANY sushi place, and just like any other sushi place..it tasted just like every other Cali roll I've had. But, plenty of crab! The slices of fish adorning my Rainbow rolls were fantastic. I'm leary of Rainbows because the fresh fish slices, but the chef came out and reassured me that the fish had been delivered earlier that morning and had the slip to prove it. Can't get much fresher than that..especially when ya know..there's not ocean for a good 300+ miles haha. This particular Rainbow Roll is only found at RA, and while I've seen them elsewhere, the amount of crab meat within the roll, makes it a far better one! I enjoyed my choices, but would probably pass on cucumber rolls again, and maybe the Cali rolls too, just to open up spots for new choices (^_^)  Service varies by day, time, and crowd. I came here many times living here, and I had good and bad service from the hostess, to the chef. The chefs are almost always fab, but there was one guy who was just snotty. Didn't see him in March, so maybe he's gone? Anywho, going around peak feeding hours or happy hour seems to generate a few cranky employers, just because it gets so darn busy! Lunch is usually better! Also, sign up for the RA newsletter and get a coupon for a half birthday discount, and plenty of deals that change weekly! I've definitely taken advantage of the half birthday deal, and it was worth it IMO.   RA is a good sushi joint on the Strip, but if you know some locals, hit them up. They have the good ones hidden up their sleeves(^_~), but if not, RA will do the trick if you're wanting sushi and can't drive because you spent the day drinking. I mean, I did give it 4 stars. Service is why it's not a 5. (^_^)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff and awesome sushi.  It might be a chain, but it has a boutique feel.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Food was alright. But the customer service was beyond Excellent! Friendly bartender made me some off the menus drinks, I ended up drinking more than I expected that night!"}
{"text":"Ra Sushi is located in the Fashion Show mall across from Wynn.   Being an Asian descendant, I grew up having Japanese cuisine my whole life and I have become more picky with my selection over the years. At my visit, I had the Beef Teriyaki Bento. I was quite pleased with the cut of the beef that was served. They used a nice steak cut. The Bento bowl was at a great value. It came with miso soup, salad, rice and a choice of protein.   The food was alright in general. The place felt quite \"Americanized\". I am not sure if I would die for to come back again. However, if I am in the area and am craving for Japanese cuisine, I would be inclined to try out different items."}
{"text":"I'm giving this one star because I have to so I can leave a comment. This place is horrific! The service was poor and when I say poor I'm trying to make this PG. The cooked chicken was barely warm and our waiter was unfamiliar with what came with the meals. We spent half our meal thirsty because we couldn't even get water. When we started to sit down the tables were set but dirty. The hostess apologized and we walked from table to table until we found a clean one.....yet she sent no one to clean them. They had dried food on them and crumbs on the chairs. In the end, the waiter came to me and said he comped one of our meals and a half of another. After reviewing the ticket....he comped us for a meal we didn't even order because he charged us for a dinner meal in addition the the lunch meals we ordered. I've eaten at the one in Tempe and Scottsdale and had no problems. The health board should make a visit to this place as well!  I'd stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and not even very good. They were ok when I didn't know of better sushi options in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The fish looks and tastes fresher than anywhere else in the area, though the service could use a kick in the butt.. The \"RA\"ckin' Shrimp appetizer and the Salmon Carpaccio are by far the best things on the menu. Definitely go during happy hour, or it's not worth the price."}
