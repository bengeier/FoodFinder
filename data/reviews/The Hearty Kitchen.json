{"text":"This is my regular lunch spot.  They have amazing veal sandwiches, way better than California Sandwich.  Their bread is soft and pillowilly (sp).  I definitely recommend getting the rapini - itis sauteed in olive oil and garlic and heightens the veal sandwich to another level.

They also other foods such as pasta, lasagna, salads, cold and hot sandwiches.  I forgot their pizza is AMAZING!  Thin crust with the right balance of toppings.  One huge slice is under $5!

If you are in the Rexdale/Etobicoke area, mark sure you visit this place.  They are only open for lunch."}
{"text":"Currently trying to breathe, as I just inhaled half of my lunch from here.  SO FULL.

I've been here plenty of times and my work used to actually have our Christmas parties here, so I'm very familiar with this place.  I meal prep every week, but once a week I leave a 'buy your lunch day'.  For the past two weeks, The Hearty Kitchen has been the winner... AND for the past two weeks, the order remains the same.  \"A piece of lasagna and a side kale salad, please!\" I don't even know how to tell you how good this lasagna is.  I think about this lasagna often, to be honest.  Maybe because they drench it in sauce, maybe because the garlic bread dipped in the sauce changed my life, maybe all the above? But man, this thing is ginormous (for me) and tasty.  Not bland at all, sauce is a game changer and just the right amount of meat and cheese.  Oh, and not at all too salty.  I'm obsessed with kale salad and they do a great one here.  Nice light dressing and very generous with a side portion.  I don't even like dipping bread into pasta sauce, this is the ONLY place I do this.  The garlic bread that comes with the lasagna become the perfect duo.  You need something to soak up all that sauce!

The lasagna and salad rack up a pretty hefty bill at $15, but I think it's totally worth it.  The meal always lasts me a lunch and dinner. So that's $15 to feed me for the rest of the day lol.  There's no way I could finish this in one sitting.

As for customer service, excellent! The ladies are so friendly and hard working.  The lunch time rush is crazy (they're only open for lunch) but don't let the long line fool you.  The ladies get through the line very fast, all while being friendly and smiling."}
{"text":"Had penne aglio and Greek salad .. Soo good .. staff was helpful .. selection was plentiful .. will be back again"}
{"text":"This is one of my FAV lunch spots as I have said in my other review. They make amazing sandwiches. 

I usually have the Steak and Rapini sandwich on a hot pepper focaccia bun but today I tried something different. 

Kale salad with grilled chicken breast

Can you say WOW!?!?!  I was SO impressed!

You have GOT to try it. Their kale salad is one of the best I have ever eaten!  I am more of a carnivore than a rabbit but today I was so impressed that I think I need to start trying more things from this place!"}
{"text":"Yummm is pretty much what I say! We order food from here probably twice a month. The lasagna is amazing and fresh!! The price is a little much, BUT sleep in mind 1 serving of lasagna is enough for 2, so to me the price is right. The ladies are always pleasant when we call and place he order and the food is always fresh and ready when we arrive.  
It's a small location and VERY busy always so if you don't want to wait call ahead and have it prepared for you so when you arrive you can leave."}
{"text":"This place is great! We get catered from here often for many events and they know what's good. I've gone here for the hot tables during lunch (starting around 12pm prime time) before and it's super busy. Might be even hard to find a spot and I've seen the line up go out the door before. If you don't mind a late lunch, it's better to go around 1pm. Def less rush of people there. 

I like any of their sandwiches. All soo yummy. 
My favourite is probably the bruschetta pizza and the lasagna  they're made fresh and it's bomb. My picture has a bunch of stuff on the plate LOL (Greek salad/pasta salad/lasagna/bruschetta slice). 
We got red velvet cupcakes as dessert :) 

Staff are super friendly and service is great. One of fav places in the Rexdale area."}
