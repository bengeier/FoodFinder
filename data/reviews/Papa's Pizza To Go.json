{"text":"Hands down best pizza we have ever had! We got the meat lovers and it was amazing! My 4 year old daughter ate the entire pizza and even asked to go back the next day. They use real fresh ingredients and they are reasonably priced. I'm not from the area but I'll drive to buy good food!"}
{"text":"Speedy service in store and delivery as well. We have tried different combinations of toppings and never be disappointed with our pizza. Love this place!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is great pizza and the service is very good. Reminds me of Dominos back when they were good. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Love this place. I reserve my 5 star pizza rating for the absolute cream of the crop... i.e. Patsy's Pizzeria in NYC. Papas Pizza was hot and delicious. The breadsticks were more than an afterthought. They were excellent. We were treated kindly. The seating area was clean. We loved it! My 10 year old Saud it's the best in the area :-). Good stuff."}
{"text":"Very good food. Chicken wings were very flavorful wish they was just a little more crispy but that would be the only thing I would change about it. The thin crust pizza was very good"}
{"text":"Nice little pizza and sub shop. Ordered the large meat lovers square. Pretty good. Also got the Italian sub, also good. Nothing special but better than most in the area. Still looking though."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Nice small town manners. I love this place."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is incredibly good. Sauce like the kind that Mama makes. Just really, really good pizza."}
