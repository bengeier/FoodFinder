{"text":"Decided to try for lunch today.  I should have read the reviews before arriving because most are on-point. It was extremely loud with only 6 tables.  The food left a lot to be desired. My mom and I both had the filet open face sandwhich.  The steak was over cooked/tough, fries were cold and the bread was dry.  Very disappointing.  Can't see myself going back and certainly not recommending it to friends."}
{"text":"Great food , atmosphere, service and prices ! We will be back for more . It's about time we got a classy restaurant around here . Don't get me wrong you can take the family but for us it was pure romance . Loved it !"}
{"text":"This little spot needs to figure out a better price point, if food and atmosphere are excellent you can forget the cost.  At this point in time food is tasty, but not memorable for the price.  There is several eateries  right around the corner that at this time are better options.  Lunch prices are better than dinner prices.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants in the Lake  Wylie area.  The food is outstanding and the portions are generous.  I love the decor.  The waitstaff is friendly and extremely helpful and informative,  I completely enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"LOVE Lily's Bistro!  Happy that there is such a great restaurant in Lake Wylie  I look forward to going there whenever I invite someone to join me for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, try the frutti di mare it was excellent. The night, Saturday, that I went had a wine special. A decent bottle of Columbia River for a reasonable price, The young woman who served us was very attentive and the table never went wanting for anything.  Now for some constructive criticism; when eating at this price level I expect their parking lot to be cleared and not a sheet of ice. Also do not sit at  a booth as every move of the person in the booth behind you will be felt as a poke in your back. Do not sit at a booth or go in icy weather and you will have a supper meal for a fair price, One last suggestion. I have not problem with a $4 or $5 bread and butter charge but the bread could use an upgrade.  Overall a delicious meal and enjoyable evening for a fair price. Try it and I think, if you live in the area, you will make it your go to place."}
{"text":"Been meaning to check this place out but wanted to let them get their feet under them first. Had a fantastic lunch today. The restaurant had a good crowd. Service was good and the waitress checked on us frequently. We started with Nana's meatball - amazing. Had the Caesar salad with filet tips - delicious... and my wife had the grilled Caesar with chicken-she loved it. Great spot! We plan on coming back for dinner- the wine list had some tasty selections!"}
{"text":"The restaurant itself had a very appealing look. The lighting is certainly not for those who are visually impaired. We got in about 6:30 on a Saturday, there was a wait, but that was expected for a holiday weekend. To be quite honest for a $90+ dollar bill for two adults with no alcoholic beverages I expected much better. I ordered the Lily's special. I thought it was delicious. Everything was well seasoned. It wasn't very warm when it arrived at the table. I also got cheesecake and it was delicious. My wife ordered the rack of lamb. She was definitely not impressed. It was overcooked and under seasoned. It's pretty bad when the green beans have no flavor. She ordered sweet tea and it was terrible, very bitter and watery tasting.   I think what made the meal the worst, which is no fault of Lily's, was our neighboring table. It was a group of about 12 and they were loud and obnoxious. Their small children were running around and dancing at my back. We could barely hear each other at the table and we were across from one another. I think the staff should have asked them politely to maintain an acceptable level since other patrons didn't need to hear their shenanigans. I doubt we will be back any time soon."}
{"text":"Been here twice and had several appetizers, entrees, and small plates. Literally everything has been great. The prices are very reasonable for what you get, entrees are $18-$35, but the level of food is something I'd expect somewhere where plates are on average $5 more. One of my favorite restaurants not only in the area, but anywhere."}
{"text":"Upscale Italian cuisine. Perfect portions with a beautiful quaint environment. Perfect for date night or a nice family night out. Steak cooked to order. Authentic style Italion cuisine. Loved the salmon crab cakes from the appetizer side. A repeat for sure!!"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch today.  To start, the service left very little to be desired. It took awhile for our server to acknowledge the table, which was in the center of the restaurant, which only had probably 6 or 8 other tables that were seated and there were 3 servers... While she was pleasant and nice, the service really didn't get much better throughout the dining experience.  They had no tea -- sweet or unsweet -- because they didn't get a delivery, but apparently that happened while we were there (it is the south, the grocery store isn't that far away, why a manager didn't get this upon opening in the morning is beyond me).   We started with the calamari. The marinara sauce was homemade and consisted of pretty much a giant tomato. There was another sauce with it though, we liked that one better. The calamari was homemade/battered there, which is always better than fresh out of the freezer.  Entrees were the Lily's Burger and Rigatoni Bolognese. Lily's Burger: The bun extended about a half inch around the entire patty. The bacon that was added on for an uncharge was forgotten about. The pickle was a spear rather than slices that would be better for a burger. Good, but too much focus on appearance than the actual quality. Nothing really to separate it and put it on the \"must go back for another\" list. Rigatoni Bolognese: This was pretty good, homemade, reminded me of my grandmother's cooking. Meat to pasta ratio, meat definitely outweighed. It had some good flavor to the dish. I didn't try the bread that came with, it looked dry and bland so I passed.  Dessert was tiramisu. It was okay. I am very picky and like my tiramisu to be moist through the entire bite; I had to eat the strawberry garnishment for this. The bottom was moist, not so much the top. It's homemade, which is a plus, but I've had better.  I gave Lily's Bistro a 2 as the food was good, but I have had better. I would've given it a 3 (which is just an \"okay\") if the service wasn't lacking. Glad we tried it, but I think we'll go to Sweetwater and Copper Pub long before returning."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Especially the calamari and rack of lamb. Glad we finally got to try this new restaurant and we will be back"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, Lily's appears to be off to a rocky start. My wife and I have dined here several times since it opened as its very close to home and different than anything else in the Lake Wylie area.  We've tried several dishes and they have - hands down - the best spaghetti and meatballs in the Charlotte area.  Definitely better than the chain choices like Maggiano's or Buca Di Beppo.    We've never had any service issues that other's have complained about.  Service is always speedy and extra polite in nicely pressed clothes and aprons giving an air of sophistication and specialness to every meal.  What the owners have done to the interior of what used to be a Japanese steakhouse is a real testament to wise design choices.  A few booths are tucked into the far side of the restaurant and some nice larger tables in the center, and a few romantic two-tops on the edges.  There is also one large table right at the entrance for large groups.  There is a small bar which has local brews on draft as well as a few stools for those so inclined to prefer bar seating.  The lighting is soft, dark enough for an intimate romantic dinner, but bright enough that a social night out with friends feels open and inviting.    Sweetwater, Copper, or T-Bones this is not - and that is a nice choice to have in an area inundated with bars and party places which seem to have taken over the Lake Wylie restaurant scene.  There is one caveat to my 5 star review - as some other reviewers have mentioned, the bread served with the entrees is a crunchy, bruschetta style bread served in one or two small slices. Especially with my favorite spaghetti and meatballs dish, this is just not serviceable.  It would be nice if there were other bread choices offered."}
{"text":"Yummy food and a nice atmosphere! We have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed. Try the meatball appetizer, the lobster macaroni and cheese,  and the homemade cheesecake. Music is nice too."}
{"text":"Just another Lake Wylie disappointment.  Scallops were not bad, the calamari appetizer was tasteless. Husband had the lamb....almost raw. The flourless chocolate cake was just a mushy mess! The wait staff was ok....she kept saying they were understaffed. Not a place I will revisit."}
{"text":"Another great Dinner by Chef Jerry at Lily's Bistro!  Each time we've been here, the service, meal, and drinks have been great!  I highly recommend this restaurant as the only restaurant in the Lake Wylie area serving 5-star food!  Had the lamb and it was perfect - including the presentation!"}
{"text":"Excellent food; beautiful dining area.  Highly recommend for that special celebration.  Be sure to save room for the tiramisu!  Especially enjoyed the quiet sophisticated atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced & the service was horrible. Sad because we need another good restaurant. Don't waste your time or $"}
{"text":"Just had dinner there with wife and a few friends. Service was good but not great. Food was fair but sort of bland. I had lunch there a few weeks before with a friend and we both felt the same way then too. I think the place has some potential. The atmosphere is decent and so is everything else... just not much more. I will try again because this area needs a good restaurant but not sure they will make unless they can step it up..."}
{"text":"Stay away is all I can say. Very upscale prices for crap food. The place was very noisy. Salad came with wilted lettuce and had parts of the stems going bad. They don't take all major credit cards. For the same price you can go to an upscale steak house in the city. Very disappointed in the service too. I'll never go back."}
