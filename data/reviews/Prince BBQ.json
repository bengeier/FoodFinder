{"text":"The Market Village BBQ place is the only place with roast pork, char siu, soy sauce chicken and duck.  They have a wide variation of menu based on the combinations of the meats.  While that's not unusual, the included soup is quite homey and flavorful.  The soup reminds me what my grandmother used to make.   Also notable is the hot sauce condiment. Try it - nice addition to the meal.  The four stars is for value and taste.  Will frequent again."}
{"text":"They have some nice BBQ items.  Unlike the BBQ stall in the First Markham Place food court (which I forget the name of right now), this stall in Market Village is more traditional as their food is saltier and has a bit more fat to it.  However, it is still very good.    We ordered the roast pork and BBQ duck with rice for $6.50 and it unexpectedly came with a small bowl of soup as well. SCORE!! I love me some soup!  The roast pork had some nice crispy skin and the BBQ duck was nice and moist.    I would probably order food from this stall first before any other stall at Market Village as it has some good combos and everything seems to be very fresh."}
{"text":"They are very friendly and make good Chinese bbq food. Their quality can match those back home, and they don't cost you an arm and leg for these treats."}
{"text":"That whole roast pork hanging  at Prince BBQ sure looked good....   It just looked so massive, crispy, meaty and fatty .... we just could not resist the temptation to order some to give it a try.  The skin I think is the best part of the whole pig, while my other friends were eating all those meaty fatty part I picked all the skin and crunched that in my mouth when they were not watching....  The meat part though I found it a little too mushy... but still really good as it was still warm and fresh!!"}
{"text":"One of the many food stalls at Market Village, I came here at my parents' recommendation to try some Chinese BBQ.  Good-looking meats hanging up front, clean and organized.  Our group took an order of the roasted pig to snack on.  Excellent, crispy skin.  Meat was flavorful but texture a bit too soft and mushy.  Overall ok, but not as good as I'd hoped.  Maybe an off-preparation?"}
