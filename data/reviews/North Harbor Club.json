{"text":"Dry salmon, cheap bread, slow service, and wildly overpriced for all that. No one in our group seemed to enjoy their meals. I walked away thinking, \"I really don't get how this place is popular.\""}
{"text":"The food is excellent. Everything I've tried so far has been expertly prepared. The bar menu is also too notch. Craft beers, infused vodkas and bourbon, unique cocktails, and an excellent bourbon and scotch selection. I recommend getting a bourbon flight or a bacon bourbon old fashioned."}
{"text":"The location and view push this in my view from a strong 4 to a 5.  Sitting on Lake Norman, it is a beautiful place to dine.  We had not been for over a year.  We got entrees we had had before: crab cakes and filet mignon.  Both were flawless.  The excellence, however, was in the side dishes, and in the dessert.  I started with a Crisp Brie Springroll.  I had never seen such a thing, but it worked well; it was served with grilled peaches and an almond creme sauce.  My wife had a Greek Salad, which featured heirloom tomatoes.  Lemon-thyme asparagus was perfectly grilled, the texture was just right, the grilling marks perfect, and the flavor sublime.  Potatoes Boulangère were a treat; they look like ordinary potato wedges but the taste is quite special.  The chickpea mash had a pleasing crunchy texture and just the right amount of heat.  The zucchini got a rave review from my wife.  I ended with a Tahitian Vanilla Bean Cheesecake with cardamon scented blueberries and an almond tuile.  Wow!  The vanilla bean and the cardamon made this a delicious treat.  We had not been to North Harbor Club for probably over a year.  I was prepared to be disappointed.  Places that are this popular and this well-located can easily lose their focus.  I instead was quite impressed."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal.  Had a great evening.  Was not rushed.  Service was spot on.  Had the Flat Iron steak, grilled perfectly, my date had the Crab Cakes,she said they were great.  Grilled Tuna was excellent to start and the desert was great."}
{"text":"This place desperately needs a new chef. The restaurant is surviving on its location alone. I have been here a few times over the last several years and always hope it will be better. The seafood is particularly disappointing. I have ordered the crab cake in the past (now maybe they have improved it since then, but I doubt it) and it was at least 75% breading with very little crab. The fact that they even have a Tilapia dish grosses me out (if you don't know what I'm talking about, do some research on Tilapia---worst fish you could eat). Then they have a catfish dish. I know there are some catfish fans and that is fine but seriously the seafood selections are mostly bottom feeders and the lowest quality types of fish. These are not the types of dishes you would expect at a restaurant that wants to be fine dining. Last night I tried the salmon. It didn't seem to be seasoned at all and was just sitting on a bed of plain quinoa (no seasoning) and raw kale (also no seasoning). It was a very sad, lack luster dish. There was a sauce drizzled over the top and while the sauce was good, I would have needed a lot more of it to give this dish any real flavor. However, a good salmon dish should not need to be drowned in sauce to be good. All of the dishes I have had were just bland and boring. I will say the appetizers have usually been better than the main courses. I have not been here for lunch/brunch so maybe I will give that a try at some point as people seem to give positive reviews about it. The location is fantastic, which is why I would really like to see the restaurant start showing that they give a damn about the food they serve."}
{"text":"This place is a gem in Davidson, NC, 30 min north of Charlotte, right by Lake Norman.  5 stars for location, food, service and selection.  Maybe, 4.9 stars (round it up to 5) because they don't have draft beer.  But they do have a pretty extensive drink menu.  From bottled beer from local brewery to scotch and whiskey, to wine and mixed drinks.  The food is top notch.  I went with a large group of 15 people.  We had shrimp and scallop appetizers, spinach and artichoke dip.  For entree, I had the perfectly done filet mignon.  Other people had salmon, tilapia, pork chop, pasta etc.   Everyone was happy with the meal.  The place handled large group really well with multiple servers taking care of everyone.  The dinner dishes were reasonably priced, $15 to $30 a plate.  This is a great place to eat out.  Will go back again when I'm in town."}
{"text":"I just moved here from Michigan and had heard pretty good reviews about the North Harbor Club. Overall I would say that it was not worth the 98 dollars on two entrees, two salads, one dessert and 3 drinks. The drinks are very expensive and the salads are so so for what you get. It is a very strange place in that entrees are pretty pricey but you are being served by college kids wearing flowered shirts. I had ordered the tilapia and was less than impressed. It was just a piece of fish that was breaded and sauteed. I expected some kind of sauce to compliment it and when I asked for tartar sauce I was told that they had none. Keep in mind there are several fish dishes on their menu. My fiance ordered the salmon and while he said it was good the actual piece of fish was very small. I noticed that the plates are filled with so much extra \"fluff\" as far as garnishes go and the presentation is a bit obnoxious. Give people good food at a good price and they will come pack. NHC has mediocre food at expensive prices."}
{"text":"Love the food and the view. The staff is great and the drinks are very good. I always get the pork chop and please try the lavender iced tea. Nice seating area outside. Brunch on Sunday's are amazing but you should definitely have a reservation. I had an Adult Grilled Cheese which was amazing!"}
{"text":"I was debating between 2 and 4 stars simply because the food, drinks and atmosphere were quite fantastic...unfortunately I was not impressed by the service. We arrived shortly before the dinner time (5:00) started and we were informed by the hostess (uninvitingly) that we could sit on the patio & have appetizers and drinks. The appetizers were quite delicious, drinks were very good (jalapeño peach margarita was fantastic!) and,  like I said, the view is beautiful! Maybe it was a hot, off day for the crew working, but customer service is everything! We had multiple people wait on us, (all who seemed quite over the day already) but I would be willing to give this place another try...simply because the potential is there for this to be a 5 star rating! Until next time..."}
{"text":"Went back for another visit to the North Harbor Club on a Saturday night, yet this time the experience wasn't as good. The service was slow as they were trying to juggle a large party in their function room. The 3 greeters at the hostess stand were fooling around and laughing so loud you could hear it from 4 tables away above the already loud crowd noise. He ordered the additional shrimp with his filet mignon and they were not as large as the server claimed they would be. Overall, still good food quality and a packed house, but these things simply should not have happened."}
{"text":"Went for the first night of Charlotte restaurant week and had a great experience.  I started with an appetizer of duck empanadas served over a slaw and with a creamy spicy sauce (it had a sweet sauce as well, but the spicy one was much better).  They were delicious, good portion size too.  My entree was a roast lamb with mustard greens and a potato cake. It was very tasty.  It had a cherry reduction with little chunks of cherry that went very well with the lamb.    The potato was great, and even the greens which is something I usually don't like.  For desert I had a chocolate tasting, which is a chocoholic's dream!  It consists of a bunch of small chocolate deserts such chocolate foam, brownie, panacota, and a chocolate bar with white chocolate ice cream.  The brownie had jack Daniels chocolate ice cream on top.  Awesome!    Very nice location by the lake and the service was great.  The waitress (Megan) was on top of things and there were several other people bringing things and checking on the table.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"Our dinner last night was terrible!  To start.. when we sat down after 10 min we had to ask the hostess if we were going to be served.  There were at least 8 staff people walking in and out of the room behind the hostess the entire time we sat there. The young girls were more interested in coming back to the hostess station to stand and talk.  Lots of stafff but no service.  The manager definitely needs to cut staff and make the others work.  My Mahi Mahi was very dry, no flavor to the fish but over seasoned!!  It was in a water type sauce..not sure what that was about.  We always wait about a year after going here hoping they have improved but we are always disappointed! Never again!!   If you are going for drinks and great atmosphere on the water it is great but don't waste your dollars on the expensive food menu."}
{"text":"I recently held a wedding rehearsal luncheon for about thirty people at the North Harbor Club.  Todd was so easy to work with.  He gave me a variety of menus to chose from and I selected one which really offered something for everyone. The staff was excellent and our guests were served shortly after ordering.  The Groom's cake (which we had delivered) was our dessert and the staff served it without any additional cost.  Although I have always loved the restaurant,  I had never had an event there.  If you have never tried it, I highly recommend it and I would encourage you to talk to Todd about any upcoming events or parties you may have.  Priced right, excellent service, great food and beautiful view!  It doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"View:  75% Lake Norman, 25% I-77, Crab cake:  25% crab 75% filler, Swordfish & Sides:  100% Bland, Glass of White Wine:  !00% benissimo."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant for Sunday brunch. We all had one of the most superb meals that we've had for a long time. Service was also excellent. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant with a nice view of the lake, but the food was unimpressive, under then over cooked and the staff was unusually unfriendly.  Will never eat here again."}
{"text":"North Harbor Club is often overlooked as a fine dining choice in the Lake Norman area because it's tucked away on Exit 30 in  Davidson. It's a gorgeous restaurant located on the water. I have eaten brunch, dinner, Thanksgiving, and Easter brunches there and had a fabulous meal. No complaints.  I didn't give it quite 5 stars because I think the food could be a little more seasoned. But I still love eating there because of the nice atmosphere, on water dining, gourmet dinner selection, and affordability.   During Thanksgiving 2008, the whole family ate there and we each got to choose our own appetizer or salad, then ate the main courses family style (they were scrumptious), then we chose our own desserts. I was very full and the service was great for how busy the restaurant was during the holiday."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot, amazing menu on paper, and horrible service and execution of the meal.  This is the kind of place where the chef rounded up some really great menu items from fine restaurants, but isn't skilled enough to pull it off well.  It's the kind of place where the restaurant owner has picked up great service ideas from fine restaurants, but skimps and hires kids as servers who don't have professional restaurant experience.  This restaurant is a pig in makeup."}
{"text":"Thumbs up for having a gluten free menu and a large patio!! I really enjoyed my filet. Warning: the jalapeño cocktail is SPICY!"}
{"text":"First visit--Excellent food, lovely nautical decor, super service from David.  Second visit--same good food but very slow service. Five different people waited on us."}
{"text":"The Harbor Club sits in a beautiful setting with a great view of the lake. The food was very good and the chocolate tasting dessert was decadent."}
{"text":"So I am going to do my review in two segments. First we started outside before dinner.  The drink service was less than stellar., so we did not start off with a good impression. Our server was not on his A game, had to ask for water and the bill several times :-( Not to mention there was not a crowd so no excuses. Now onto the meal. Food was excellent , loved the pasta dish, catfish was good and deep fried potatoes was great . Scallops were wonderful and loved the beet salad. I have a conflicted review, good food, marginal service , but location is on the water so that make up for the short falls."}
{"text":"If I could give it less than this I would. My husband and I sat for 30 minutes with water only and no one even attempting to converse with us or take our order while several others who arrived after us had been waited on. Highly disappointed."}
{"text":"Average food, Ok service. The server mixed up our orders. One person got no chorizo (because she can't eat it), and the other did. They were mixed up and the person who did not order chorizo was quite upset. Would not recommend, but would also not advise people to avoid this place"}
{"text":"The food is great and I've always had good service here. It's definitely a nicer restaurant and really pretty for a holiday dinner. I think the crowd it attracts is sometimes a little funny, but if anything it makes for fun people-watching at the bar. The beet and goat cheese salad is a favorite of mine - and their fish entrees are great, too."}
{"text":"We are new to the area, and decided to give this place a try for our early Valentines celebration. Dinner was excellent! We started with the crab cake appetizer which our server recommended, the jalapeño creamed corn that it's served with is to die for! My husband loved it so much that he decided to get the Flat Iron steak which also comes with the corn. It was delicious & a generous portion, which is something he appreciates in a meal. I chose the seafood linguini. It was perfect: the right amount of heat, shrimp, scallops, and crisp vegetables. Again, the portion was generous!  Our server was friendly but not overbearing, and she made excellent recommendations. We can't wait to come try the patio when the weather warms up."}
{"text":"Second trip here, both times for dinner. I am not a huge fan of this. Service was spotty, hostess (both times) had an attitude and teh decor is a little to nautical for my tastes. Yes, its on a lake but it's not on the ocean. It did not feel warm or inviting however that is what I felt they were going for in teh decor. The food is fine. No complaints, nothing special, lots of safe dishes. I would imagine the patio in the summer is a great hang out and I do intend to give it a shot when the temps rise again next year."}
{"text":"An always packed weekend brunch place. Prices for all classic&popular menu items you can think of are low in exchange for high customer volume, unlike other fancy places, you know. Hash browns cooked with a little bit of bacon and other veggies, so you can imagine the blend of flavor and it's a favorite of many people!"}
{"text":"We had a family dinner consisting of 8 people on a Fri night. Although we had to wait not having reservations they sat us outside in there bar area where service was exceptional and the drinks were awesome.  Later we were seated for dinner overlooking the lake and marina. It seemed just like Long Island in the summer. Food was awesome!!! I would recommend it to fam and friends!"}
{"text":"We ate here 4-14-2014 Monday night.  We had great service, very close to some of the best 5 star places we have been to.  The food was excellent four adults and everyone liked what the ordered.  Someone got the crab cakes and they were huge.  4 stars instead of 5 because the menu is a little limited and no specials.  I was here a couple of years ago and had bad service.  There was nothing but great service this last visit.  Cheers"}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!! Great ambience next to the water. Crab dip was our favorite. The chocolate cake was so good and rich - we loved it. Zach was the best waiter!!! Will be back."}
{"text":"Great ambiance by the lake and great service! Ordered the Cajun shrimp and grits. Rarely am I a fan of the southern staple, but this was quite good. There was the right amount of heat in the food present and the mixture of cheese was perfect. Perfect place for brunch/dinner. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is very expensive and food was only ok. Not worth the price. I would have given more stars but we received TERRIBLE service. Our waitress (Allison I believe) was extremely rude.  We had reserved a table for a birthday dinner. As soon as the server got to the table she had a bad attitude.  This basically ruined the night for us. Will not ever go back here."}
{"text":"Dinner tonight at the North Harbor Club was excellent. My dinner choice was the Pan Seared Pork Chop with stuffed Poblano Pepper and Cheddar Grit Cake, delicious. Would highly recommend. Todd was our waiter, he was great, started us with a Cold Shrimp Cocktail with three sauces, excellent and drinks. Service was great! Kudos to the Chef."}
{"text":"Best waiter service I've had in years. Amir our server was the best. The fried pickles were awesome and the view was picture perfect Will return."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of a yacht club my parents belonged to in Minnesota on the Mississippi river. I really like the overly dark, over the top nautical theme. They have an AWESOME patio area right on the lake- one of the best patio places on the lake.  I've been here a few times, and agreeing with the other reviews, the hostess often has an attitude (like the snotty \"my dad made me get a job while I'm in college, but I hate it!\" attitude that is rampant around lake area establishments). I think they were different girls each time, and they were literally polite, opened the door, etc, but you could tell she was mad we were there. I didn't actually expect the \"local attitude\" here though being its a nicer place. I guess the higher pricing doesn't really translate into better customer service here.   The food is great. The portions are huge and they use really quality ingredients. Also cute presentations and awesome grilled veggies. The waitstaff and bartenders are all really nice, but they just kind of go through the motions of what they're supposed to do (like they became a blank server robot upon getting to work). Maybe the staff aren't supposed to display personalities or something, or maybe they all just need some redbull, but I wish there was more of a genuine-personal feeling from the staff. No joking, no content, no nothing, just an empty bartender/server spitting out their lines.   They also have $4.50 martinis on Mondays and amazing desserts. Try the creme brulee (the menu says its butterscotch flavor, which I hate, but I didn't taste butterscotch, more like a really rich vanilla. Soooo good)."}
{"text":"We recently had a gathering with our family for a part of 10 and a reservation for 7:30.  We were not given a table until close to 9:00 and it continued to go downhill from there.  Our entres came out and they were cold. When we complained to the assistant manager he preceded to yell at us that we weren't getting a free meal, which is not what we were asking for.  He threw a couple of sides for one on the table and left and for the first time in my life I decided that we should leave too and we did. I have dined there for almost 8 years and  will never return.  The food was never that good but I loved sitting on the water.  I only gave it one star, because I couldn't figure out how to post this without any star."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice in less than two weeks (lunch & brunch) after not being here for a while. Nothing can beat sitting outside on the patio in this gorgeous weather, on the lake, and enjoying great food and beverages! The staff is very professional and efficient. Even though we had to wait, it wasn't too long (actually less time than quoted). Our entrees were delicious and the wine & beer list has a good variety. One detail: the name and description of the entree does not always match up with what I thought it might be (ex: Spinach and Shrimp Salad). I enjoy an adventure but if you are picky I recommend asking for a description. I am looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"Pro: Atmosphere Con: Very limited/small menu  I've visited this restaurant twice since the spring; both of which for Sunday brunch. This cute restaurant is very discreet and probably unheard of to many natives of the area. The restaurant is located by a pier at Lake Norman and has a tropical feel. I believe the relaxing atmosphere is the restaurants greatest asset.   The brunch/lunch menu is extremely small with approximately 8 options. However, I get their house salad with strips of fillet and its quite a treat. My friend gets their fries and hamburger and loads it up w/ the additional options (mushrooms, onions, etc.). Its delicious.  The drink menu is appealing as well. They have an assortment of liquors and wines. There's more on the drink menu than the food menu.   Makes for a pretty good Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"My wife and I were first timers at North harbor and overall it was GREAT! The ambience was very nice being by the shore of LKN. Our waiter \"Wes\" was courteous, food service was prompt. The menu offered a wide selection of seafood and food for meat and potatoes appetites. Drinks were awesome. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the food and the service. I would highly recommend the herb roasted salmon. It is nice to see a restaurant offering clean healthy food and good portion sizes."}
{"text":"They recently changed the menu again and it shows. I loved their old Tuna dish, but they changed it to a very bland tasting Tuna with green olives and dates! Even a chef friend of mine questioned this \"recipe\", which by the way this restaurant is desperately in need of a chef! My wife got the crab cakes and was disappointed as well. Too much filler which was inconsistent and clumpy in parts of the crab cake. The location is fantastic on the water and I'm hopeful they make some changes to the menu as I've had good meals here in the past. They just missed the mark on the new menu."}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot when in the Lake Norman area.  It's fine for casual lunch but also great for a business lunch.  Great view, especially when sitting outside on the patio overlooking the marina and lake.  Service has always been right on, not intrusive but keeping a constant eye on food and beverages.    Yesterday's lunch was a great crab cake salad with a nice sized crab cake on a mixed greens salad with crushed tomatos, cucumbers, feta cheese and perfect dressing. Today's lunch was a fantastic fried green tomato BLT, something I will have again next time I'm there for lunch.  If you want a nice lunch, that's really not too expensive, overlooking the lake and a few nice boats, then you have to try North Harbor Club."}
{"text":"Great for Sunday Brunch. Crab cake salad is amazing. A bit pricey for the experience but worth the occasional treat. They used to have coupons for brunch which made the bill more reasonable but that have stopped that.  Overall, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've recently went back for the first time in over a year and I must say they have made some improvements..  They have a new group of servers who are friendly and the food has remained excellent.."}
{"text":"I love this place for the lake view and good food (but really mostly the lake view)"}
{"text":"Great Lunch - just a bit Pricey  Decided to take the wife to lunch on this glorious sunny day and picked the NHC because of its water front location - a very good choice even from inside seating (we were given a 2 top on the window!)  Food was very good. My wife gave her catfish lunch special a straight \"A\". Fish filets were nice sized, hot out of the fryer, crispy, and NOT greasy. I had the duck panini sandwich special, and while it was tasty, it was only worthy of a \"B\" in my judgement. Those two things aside, the highlight of the meal was the tempura fried asparagus appetizer -uuummm yummy! We are giving that dish an \"A+\". Nice sized stalks, served hot and perfectly fried - don't miss trying them.  Our waitress was pleasant and helpful (our first time there). She knew the details of the dishes and was helpful in our choices.   We'll definitely go back and can't wait for a little warmer weather to enjoy the outside seating!"}
{"text":"It was our first time and we enjoyed it. We sat outside on a warm sunny day. Crab cake salad was just okay, It would have been much better with lump meat crab. The catfish in the cornmeal crisped catfish was good. It was light and crisp but the cole slaw was too acidic for me. Overall the food was okay but the view and service made up for it."}
{"text":"Beautiful waterfront views in spring and summer. Very good hamburgers here but service is not consistent. Limited menu but still love the atmosphere. Most of the food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to get Sunday brunch that had outside seating and a full bar AND didn't stop serving breakfast at 2pm (no judging).  This place serves brunch til 2:30pm!  Sadly, there was a wait for an outside table, seeing that it was the first warm day in a while, and we missed brunch by like 5mins.  While we waited we had a chance to sit on the benches on the dock and watch the boats go by.  There is also a very nice wine shop/gelato store next door.   We checked out the wine shop which was very quaint and chatted with the owner.  He said that they do sunset wine tastings on the lake including dinner.  It sounded like a very sexy excursion, I definitely want to make it back for that!    When we got seated we promptly ordered 2 bloody mary's (extra spicy).  They were nice and spicy, good flavor, but really needed a hit of old bay!  I noticed everyone around us was also enjoying libations.  Bloody's, martinis, spritzers, beers, wine....  It was the perfect day for sitting on the dock and taking in the scenery over an adult beverage.  My date and I barely talked, not in an awkward way, just in a satisfied with our surroundings way.  We had flip flops on, feet up, and sun glasses stunnin.'  Everyone's food looked awesome.  The salad and burger looked great but we both went for the crabcake po boy.  It came with some aoli, shredded lettuce, sliced roma tomato and a big Kaiser roll.  The only thing po boy about this sandwich, was the shredded lettuce.  Lets face it, it was a crab cake sandwich.  Not saying I didn't enjoy it, but that was no po boy.  A tasty crabcake though, not a MD crabcake, but a tasty one;)  Honestly, I could have sat there all day.  I would definitely go back for dinner on the lake."}
{"text":"I have been going to NHC for many years and the up and down has been like a roller-coaster. Service issues have always been more bothersome than the food or quality of preparation. They frequently change the menu selections and that is mostly a good thing. They drop a few, add a few and in the long run it balances out to make a pretty nice offering.   Back to the service...I'm happy to report a major swing in the right direction! I can't tell for sure, but I think the big difference is with the addition of an older gentleman that works on the deck. He appeared to be managing the outdoor seating area. Certainly guiding and watching the college students that would otherwise be in charge if he weren't there. Kudos to whoever thought of this arrangement!   I liked the lunch selections better than the breakfast brunch options. Food and service aside--no better place to hangout on a pretty day!"}
{"text":"Went here for a private event.  Rehearsal dinner for a wedding.  Started on the patio with drinks and appetizers.  Great selection and very courteous servers ensured all guests were well taken care of.  Moving on to dinner we were put in a private room that was set up very comfortably.  Some venues try to crowd too many people in a space but this was perfect.  The room itself was interesting with gorgeous photos of boats and a ceiling mounted catamaran illuminated  up with lighting.     Dinner was a pre fixe selection of really good dishes.  Most impressive was the fact they served the entire party at once.  Everything was delicious and again the servers kept all guests happy with drinks."}
{"text":"We used to love this restaurant - have not been in several years ( moved away) we had the opp to stop in Monday afternoon - were rather disappointed in the menu choices.  My husband had the Tilapia and I had stuffed chicken  with scalloped potatoes both were not very good. The chicken was over cooked - stuffing was good and the portion sizes for the price were very small  The Tilapia was the worst piece of fish he has ever had...   I don't think we will stop by again..."}
{"text":"Go here!  I ordered the Slow Roasted Turkey and Avocado Panini that has pecan smoked bacon, creamy havarti cheese and is served on a cranberry nut bread. By far the best sandwich I ate on my entire trip to North Carolina! Eating something so deliciously flavorful and yet simple was a treat for my tastebuds.   You can enjoy your sandwich while looking out at Lake Norman from their waterfront deck. Great weather and great food... does it get better than that?  The parking situation was a bit odd (there is ample parking don't worry!) and I thought I was in the wrong place at first. But once you walk down to the restaurant you realize you are exactly where you should be and you won't want to leave.  North Carolina was state #28 on my list and this lunch experience was one of the most memorable parts of my trip. I would go back to Lake Norman just for that sandwich!"}
{"text":"When you take a boat to lunch, how can it be bad?  We arrived to North Harbor Club on Saturday afternoon around 230pm.  There was a designated NH slip ready and waiting for us.  I can imaging during peak lunch/dinner hours, slips fill up fast.    We got an outdoor table (with an umbrella!) right away and our waiter, Wesley, brought us water quickly.  I had a glass of the white sangria which was very refreshing on the hot day.  E and I both ordered the mixed greens salad with steak; my parents both went for the seared tuna sandwich.  We also got an order of the asparagus fries to share.  Everything was delicious!  The asparagus fries were just incredible and one order was plenty for the four of us.  Our steak was ordered medium and came out perfectly such.  After a bite of the tuna sandwich, I was not surprised that my mom had only cut me off a tiny sliver.     Ate our lunch and hopped back on the boat to head home.  Perfect day!"}
{"text":"CHANDLER SHOULD BE FIRED!  He accosted a customer near me and I've never witnessed such behavior!!!"}
{"text":"Went on Thursday night. I ordered Beef & Reef medium rare which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. GF ordered the crab cakes which also were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Service was good and place had a nice ambience for a date."}
{"text":"Brunch is great! Spicy Bloodies!  Food is good quality and great atmosphere on the lake"}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting family in NC and was given a gift certificate to the North Harbor Club.  We used it for our anniversary, at lunch time.  Wonderful meal!  The spinach dip was almost too pretty to eat.  I ordered a chicken wrap that was devine.  If I remember correctly, my husband ordered a lunch portion steak and he loved it.  I would love to go back in the summer and sit outside!  The view was wonderful!  It seemed to be a very busy place for business lunches,"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. It's located on the lake and the view is amazing. What's even more amazing about this place is the food and wine selections.   We decided to sit outside to enjoy the view and was seated immediately. The server, whose name escapes me was wonderful. The atmosphere was romantic and was perfect for our date.  We ordered the shrimp flatbread, tuna and asparagus/fried green tomato appetizer! Everything was delicious and full of flavor. If we had more of an appetite, I could review the entrees however I plan to dine here again in the near future.  The inside dining area was well lit and designed. The bathroom, which you should know by now is important to me was extremely clean!  The only caveat, I wish the manager had made their rounds to ask about our dining experience. That always pushes a four star review to five!"}
{"text":"This place really disappoints me.  It has the perfect location, but the food is bland and terrible.  I have eaten here multiple times for lunch and dinner, and it always aggravates me.  I will not eat here again.  The only reason I give any stars is because its on the lake."}
{"text":"Lovely location on the terrace overlooking Lake Norman.  Had dinner there with very good, friendly service, the highlight being the Coastal Lump Crab Cake starter, sufficient for me as an entree. The lobster mac'n cheese and Asparagus fries were also well liked. The downside was returning for brunch the next day when we all had \"the dock\" eggs, bacon, hash browns and french toast - have had better at Ihop."}
{"text":"Great food. Tastefully decorated. Excellent location. The North Harbor Club is also accessible by water, has 9 slips available and a very nice outdoor seating area.  Proper dress for such an attractive restaurant is usually expected but due to the ability to reach the restaurant via the lake you could still feel comfortable dining in much more casual attire. I only wish the portions were slightly larger."}
{"text":"The pasta with the butternut squash and pumpkin seeds is amazing.  Not sure what it is called love sitting outside by the lake.  Wish the prices were a bit better but it's waterfront real estate."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Wednesday around 1:15pm.  It was crowded but we were able to get a table outside right away.  The tables each have a yellow umbrella which is cheery and provides shade.  The view of Lake Norman is very pretty and is of course the main reason to eat outside.  Our server was very courteous and knowledgeable.  I had the roasted turkey panini which he recommended and it was delicious! Bacon, Gruyere cheese and avocado with turkey on cranberry nut bread- great combination.  Pricing was comparable to area restaurants and the food was excellent.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"They have great food and greater cocktails. My go to is the Hemingway. Friendly bar staff and nice place to gather with friends or family on the lake."}
{"text":"North Harbor Club is one of our favorite places to take clients, friends and family.  Food and service were always good. What happened to this place??  My husband and I brought a client here tonight. We were embarrassed. Our server was friendly but the food was so disappointing. We asked for bread w/ our wine while we were waiting for dinner. The server brought us 3 thin sliced (looked deep fried) pieces of ciabatta crackers. It looked like something that should have been served with a dip or cheese, but it was on a big white plate and looked really skimpy and tasteless. When dinner came it was so disappointing. My rare tuna was cooked med - med well, the arugula and tomato were as bland as the tuna. My husband commented that his fillet was mediocre and of course my client was too polite to comment on her dinner. I can't help but think that something has changed, management? Chef? I don't think we'll be back,"}
{"text":"Went to the North Harbour Club with friends recently.  What a wonderful place. It is right on the lake with a wonderful view of the water and the boats. We all decided to have appetizers and ordered several for the table  The shrimp appetizer was fabulous as was the seafood dip and the macaroni and cheese. We had drinks and were happy and full. Our waiter was attentive and very pleasant. Can't wait to go back! They have a great dinner menu too."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant on Lake Norman!...Great food, excellent and attentive service, presentation is impeccable, great view and ambience.  Excellent for a business or a romantic dinner.  Staff is knowledgeable, and professional. Strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited North Harbor Club on Mothers Day. The menu selection was fabulous. From the salad, to the pasta station, to the smoked chicken to the collard greens...just excellent!! Not to mention, our server Megan took good care of our party of 14. All of the mothers enjoyed themselves. We will be back."}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype, you're paying for the view. I took my family here for breakfast around Christmas time. The place was decorated nicely. I'm sure it is lovely to sit out overlooking the lake during warmer months. Moving on, the food was subpar. It was no where near the premium price we paid. We tried just about everything. My companions had the sample platter. Nothing was very good. I had steak and eggs. The steak was absolutely awful. Seasoned poorly, plus I think it was of the frozen variety. The home fries were alright, but honestly, how hard is it to fry potatoes? The sausage wasn't very good, and french toast was mediocre, plus my eggs were overcooked. Move on!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view over the water. The Dock brunch plate hit the spot with a mix of sweet and savory. Gteat service and nice ambiance for a business or romantic dinner."}
{"text":"Always a great selection around Lake Norman. The atmosphere outside is awesome and you can't go wrong with lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been here 25 plus times.  The only complaint is their menu is getting a little long in the tooth.  With all the new restaurants coming to Davidson , I think they need a menu refresh.    BB"}
{"text":"Great place to boat to and eat if you're looking for some fancier fare in a comfortable atmosphere.   Wait staff are friendly and knowledgeable. The outdoor patio is set in a really nice condo development, anchored by a cove and tiny marina with reserved slots for restaurant patrons."}
{"text":"Looking for something different on Memorial Day weekend and stumbled across this restaurant.  We drove up from mid town Charlotte to check it out and are glad that we did.  The sun was out and we had a great view of lake Norman.  The Bourbon Bloody Mary was really, really good as were the shrimp and grits.  I've got to say, even the chicken strips my daughter ordered were fantastic!  I'm not sure how often we will drive up for a meal but we definitely have this restaurant on our list.  I forgot to mention the friendly and accommodating staff were great as well."}
{"text":"Came here on  friends recommendation during a vacation to North Carolina (we are from NY). This place was absolutely great--the Flatiron steak was one of the best I have ever had--that includes Ruth Crist's and Peter Lugar's here in NYC. And out server, RJ was great. If you are in the area--or even close, do NOT miss this place !!!"}
{"text":"Really nice Sunday afternoon on Lake Norman. The staff at North Harbour were great and Steve our server was wonderful. I got the Turkey avocado Panini but it was more of a melt and my husband got the Cuban. The drinks were refreshing and quick.  I got the Lavender Lake Tea was very good and my husband got the Pineapple Mule. If we ever visit this area again we would make sure to come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Just had brunch at North Harbor Club yesterday and here's what I really liked about it:  - Location.  It is right next to Lake Norman and the view is very nice.  There are plenty of tables outside and plenty of window tables inside if you don't feel like dining outside.  It's great to be able to have a meal with that pretty scenery.  - Presentation.  The food is served on classy ceramic white plates and placed in a very eye catching way.  You can tell the thought and consideration behind the layout of each dish.  I think of food as art and love eating at places where it's treated as art.  - Portion size.  The amount of food you get for what you pay is really generous and more than plenty.  You can easily make two meals out of one.  Our total was $22 and change for ordering two entrees and drinks and there was soo much food than what we needed to eat.  I thought paying $22 was a steal.  What was not so great:  - Service.  The hostess was nice but not uber friendly.  She looked like a bit of a bored college student.  She opened the door for us each time we came in and went out but something about how she carried herself said she'd rather be anywhere else but at North Harbor Club (I can't blame her though, it was Saturday!).   Our waiter was nice but I don't think he really understood us when we explained one of us was vegan.  He brought out grits that was made with heavy butter to my vegan friend and the potatoes that he got seemed to have bacon bits in them.  I'm vegetarian and my potatoes tasted like they had bacon in them as well, and my wild mushroom and spinach frittata had a chunk of something that resembled and tasted like meat.  Overall the food felt mediocre and it didn't help that a vegan and a vegetarian got meat in their food!  I'd say that North Harbor Club is a cool spot to go for eating out but I'd be cautious as a vegan or vegetarian of getting food that you can actually eat.  It does have a pleasant atmosphere and the location is superb so if you can ensure the food you get is what you want, you'll most likely be happy eating at this establishment."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place The view, food, drinks, atmosphere, and service! If I could give this place 10 stars I would in a heartbeat! Anyone who has never been here I totally recommend this place! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We stopped by the North Harbor Club on Sunday for a beverage and quick bite. Since the weather was nice, we sat outdoors. We found the service to be so-so. The menu was quite limited as it was too late for brunch but too early for a full dinner menu. (The lunch menus we were handed were a paired down version of what is posted on their website.) Since I was not particularly hungry, I had the North Harbor Club Lobster Chowder. The menu described it as a chunky veggie studded lobster chowder, drizzled with sherry cream. I asked the server how it was prepared, and got sort of a shrugged answer that it was a creamy chowder. That I would expect from a chowder, but what I was really trying to find out if it was prepared with bacon as many seafood chowders are. When I asked this question directly, I was told no. So, I gave it try. It was not bad, but the veggies were sort of sparse and there was one little lump of lobster meat sitting on top of the soup. It sort of had a tomato base broth and overall was not as rich and creamy as a typical chowder. Also, it was not served with crackers or anything else on the side, which I would have expected. Since I was not particularly hungry, it was fine but to serve as a meal, you would definitley need to pair a salad or an appetizer with it. My partner chose the Carolina Lump Crabcake with oven roasted Yukon Gold potatoes, thyme and garlic with asparagus. The crab cake was nicely done - mostly crab meat without too much \"filler\". The veggies were nicely roasted, but the plating and presentation looked a bit on the sparse side. Overall, I would not go out of my way to eat here again but its ok for a drink and a light lunch if you happen to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for lunch, brunch or dinner. I adore waterfront dining and North Harbour Club does it all nicely. If the weather is nice, it's great to sit outside under the umbrella tables. I love the Wedge Like Salad and the Key Lime Pie!"}
{"text":"Mother's Day brunch was delicious! The biscuits and gravy were phenomenal! The brunch was a bit pricey ($36 each), but the food was delicious. It did not disappoint. Plus the atmosphere is wonderful - a table right on the water! Wow!"}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite place on Lake Norman. They do some pretty good cocktails and the dinner entrees are delicious with generous portions. We've almost never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for a table even without reservations. They are also fantastic with letting us bring out puppy to dinner as long as we're sitting outside on the patio.  One night after we ordered, a storm started blowing in out of nowhere. We noticed the staff scurrying about to take down umbrellas and move people inside. They set up a few tables under the overhang and held one of them for us so that we could still get out meals with the dog by our side. They even bring her a water bowl every time.  Honestly haven't had a bad thing on the menu yet and one of these times we'll make it for brunch. We've heard that's good too, but haven't been yet."}
{"text":"I give this place a 1 just because its on the lake. Nothing but bad albeit raw food such as chicken. Is there a Chicken Sushi ?? No.   Service sucks and the management/owners just do not care. The patio is just that.  Inside if they needed a 1980's scene in a movie this place and Denny s would fit the bill.  It sucks.  Would say from a 7/11 before I would visit here again which means never."}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Unique menu. Beautiful setting on the lake. My Wife and I have been here many times over the years. We found it when we moved to NC 10 years ago and have been going back ever since. Only down side is that when we first started going to eat here it was very cozy, quiet and comfortable, lately the atmosphere seems a bit noisy and bustling. Everyone is hip to this place now."}
{"text":"Not one of the better country club eateries I've been to.  Which is a shame, because it's location on Lake Norman is quite pleasant.  The quality of dishes on their limited menu is average at best, and inedible at worst.  We ordered asparagus fries, which are delicious if executed correctly.  Instead, it tasted like someone had taken asparagus and boiled it in a gallon of grease.  Literally inedible by myself and everyone in my party.  I'm not a food snob, I eat almost anything even remotely edible, but this was just disgusting.  My sandwich's ingredients tasted very old and not fresh.  I won't be returning, and will recommend to others to steer clear."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful day! I was actually on my way to Charlotte Mall when I saw the lake from the corner of my eye and noticed the Bar and Restaurant off the next exit. Couldn't resist so I said screw shopping, I can sit next to the lake and have a martini.  Plenty of outside seating as well as inside. Sat inside to see the bar area. Only a couple people sitting down.  I decided to try the Gulf Shrimp (Shrimp Cocktail). Omg! So good, I loved the he variety of sauces served with it. Two shrimp in each sauce. Not sure what the white sauce was but that was my favorite.  I bet the fish entrees would be worth trying.  Great view of the lake inside the bar as well."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I've ever experienced - been here twice in the last month and it's almost like they don't want you here - both times they have almost run us off - keep trying to give them a chance because we like coming here on out boat, but the service is terrible - food is just ok - wish there was another choice close by ...  Had to ask for a menu 3 times this visit."}
{"text":"My first and not last time here was pretty excellent. After a few hours on the lake, my ladies who lunch decided to eat here and no one was disappointed.   I have to say, I'm the pickiest, most judgemental of our group of 5 and I have no complaints at all. We ate at a bar table because the restaurant seemed full and there was no way in hell we were going to sit outside in 95°F+ weather after being on a boat all morning, so it fit our group just fine. The patio did seem inviting with lakefront/boat views and shady umbrellas...but maybe next time.  We started with the fried asparagus appetizer and the spinach artichoke dip. The dressing underneath the tempura'd asparagus was nutty, a little sweet and definitely accompanied the dish. The arugula piled on top wasn't dressed, but that didn't detract from anything. The stalagmite recreation of chips sticking out of the dip made me giggle because it seemed so 1990s, but the dip was decent. Not as good as the asparagus, though.  I ordered the grilled shrimp salad and it was flavorful and light, thanks to the bacon bits. It came tossed with a vinaigrette but it only left an oil slick on my greens, no flavor. The shrimp were simple and on a skewer with no tails. Next time I'll try a burger, like most of my friends did. No... next time I'm going to visit this place for brunch. I really want to see what they do with brunch."}
{"text":"Great view, great drinks, pretty great food. I prefer the brunch menu over the dinner menu only because of the BLT with fried green tomatoes. Delish!"}
{"text":"What a find sitting right on the lake. Great food with a fabulous atmosphere and and even friendlier staff. Thoroughly enjoyed this spot on the water."}
{"text":"We have been here 3 times since moving to NC and love it. We have yet to come by boat, but either way- love it here. I love sitting outside after dinner on one of the sofas having a glass of wine... very relaxing to sit on the water and watch the boats. The food is excellent. Try the fried green tomatoes for the appetizer - it is delicious! I think out of all the restaurants we tried on the lake so far, it's the best one by far. (To be fair, we have not tried them all yet). I like that you can dress super casual or dress up if you want. Oh and for people with dogs, they allow your dog to sit at your table with you (outdoors). Nice touch."}
{"text":"Had a great Sunday brunch with friends from Florida. Love the view. Food was delicious. We got the steak and eggs, mash potatoes Omelette, croissant French toast and the Fried green tomato BLT. The lobster chowder was different then what we expected- but still yummy. Can't wait to go back when we're on the boat!"}
{"text":"I believe it was just okay. The hostess must have plenty on her mind.she seem to have a bit of a a chip on her shoulder, eventually, it subsided. My guest never received her soup. the food including the hot tea was \"tempered,\"as its best.   ( I was expecting to be at least \"hot\". The tomatoes under the  salmon were overly ripe of a consistency of \"mush.\" The crab cake were delicious and real crab meat. However, the hostess says the tortillas chips was fresh out the oven, well, let say it WAS more out of the BAG."}
{"text":"Interesting restaurant with tons of potential.... my wife and I joined a few other couples here for a birthday party.  It was simply OK... food was above average, service was average, and the atmosphere was less than impressive.  C+"}
{"text":"Pretty average and not too fancy. Giving it to stars because it doesn't deserve the four stars in yelp. Service was OK, Food was good on some dishes that just average on others, and the atmosphere was pretty good right by the lake, it's right off the highway to so it's convenient if you're going down 77."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Best option on the lake. Weather its drinks for happy hour or dinner with clients this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"Beautiful view of the lake while having a nice meal. I like going on Sunday for brunch. Dinners are fabulous, but a little more pricey. I like the chicken mozzarella melt (it's more like a quesadilla) with Greek salad. Breakfast is really good, but they only have it on Sunday's."}
{"text":"I enjoyed a wonderful lunch outing with my co-workers today! The food, the service and the setting made for any incredible dining experience! We started with the fried asparagus, fried pickles and crab and pimento cheese dip... everything was delicious and a great hit by all! I selected the crab cake salad as my entree and the crab cake was huge and loaded with crab, not bready at all! It came with fried pita sticks and fried chick peas, to make this salad a one of a kind. For dessert, we all shared the bread pudding (My favorite), the creme brulee (my second favorite), the key lime cheesecake, and the flourless chocolate cake. All were good but definitely the bread pudding and creme brulee were crowd pleasers! So, this is definitely a new favorite restaurant of mine, as long as the weather permits for outdoor dining, which I absolute love!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here the Saturday before Christmas. Right on the lake, great view. We sat by the bar closest to the lake. The restaurant is pretty big with plenty of seating. It wasn't busy when we arrived.  Our server was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. Unfortunately, I don't remember her name, but she was a young girl with dark hair. They have a pretty extensive menu. I should say, menus. Yes, plural. A bit confusing, but we decided on a glass of Riesling, an old fashioned for my SO and fried pickles to start. He wasn't a fan of their version of the old fashioned but did not complain. We devoured the fried pickles within minutes. We were hungry and they were breaded and salted to perfection. The sriracha and horseradish dipping sauces were great, too.  For our main entrees, I ordered the Cajun shrimp and grits and the SO ordered the fried catfish with fried mashed potatoes and pickled cabbage.  To be honest, I was a bit turned off by the shrimp and grits at first. It looked soupy. But just like the saying goes, \"don't judge a book by its cover!\" As soon as I took a bite I was sold. It was full of flavor and they were not stingy with the shrimp and sausage. I was very pleased. Although I did not try the catfish and mashed potatoes, my SO really enjoyed his meal as well. No complaints from him and he ate all his food. We decided to order dessert: butterscotch creme brulee with gingerbread cookies on the side and key lime pie. Mmm, mmm, mmm! They hit our sugar spots. We practically licked the creme brulee dish clean. We couldn't finish the key lime pie and the cookies that came with the creme brulee, so we took them to go.  Pretty satisfied with our lunch experience. Good food, great portions, reasonable prices, beautiful view, and wonderful customer service! We will be back, hopefully when it's warmer so we can enjoy the patio."}
{"text":"Never had a bad meal here!  Love the pork chops the mac and cheese and seriously anything on their menu!  Prices are steep but food is delish and location Devine!  We especially enjoy boating to north harbor club at sunset for patio dining!"}
{"text":"Thank you for a wonderful night! We will most definitely be coming back.  Our night started off at another restaurant where we got seated 40 minutes after our reservation time and was never waited on for another 10 minutes. We left and then came here and we are so glad we did.  We came in and told the hostess what happened and we have a very hungry 3 year old with us. She immediately told us the kids menu and gave the waiter a heads up on our situation. Once our waiter, Jason, came over he asked for our 3 year olds dinner choice. He got it out so quick for her!! We were all so happy that they rushed the order for her. We then ordered drinks and appetizers. I got the golden and roasted beet salad and it was AMAZING! Tasted fresh and the goat cheese was the perfect consistency with the beets. We then got our entrees. I ordered the Mediterranean tuna. Great seasoning, cooked to perfection, and not much oil which was a relief. Sometimes restaurants overdo it on the oil but they didn't. For dessert I ordered he brioche bread pudding and it didn't disappoint. It tasted like a moist cake and the syrup around it was delicious - I felt as if I could drink it.  Thank you North Harbor Club for making our night! We had a blast celebrating our wonderful moms and a masters graduation! We will be returning!"}
{"text":"Still my go to spot for LKN waterfront restaurant. Ambiance is great inside and outside. We continue to take our out of town guests here and we always enjoy ourselves. Recently went for dinner. I ordered the Seared Mediterranean Tuna for my main entree. The slight bitterness of the salad goes well with the flavor of the tuna. Definitely filling. Topped it off with the Tian of Chocolate. I'm not a huge fan of sweet and this dessert was spot on. Wish there was a little more of the sorbet though. Oh and if it helps with deciding what to order, their salmon is farmed raised."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the salmon and filet mignon ( I split entrees with my friend). The salmon and filet were cooked to perfection. The side dishes were yummy as well. The service was spot on!  We sat at a table beside the bar and the service was super fast!  I will definitely visit again. There is outside seating that looks out on Lake Norman."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go and enjoy a bottle of beer or a glass of wine on a warm summer day right by the lake. The sitting is great & the view of Lake Norman is beautiful. You can choose to have a table outside or inside the restaurant. The food was excellent and we got seated right away, but the service was a bit slow. But didn't matter to us since we were not in any hurry. Good selections on the menue, as well as the wine list & desserts."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for lunch and we sat outside.   I had the green tomato blt and my friend had the crab cake salad.  My blt was very well crafted.  Thick slices of tomato, nice crisp bread that did not impede the flavor of the filling. Good bacon and tasty spread inside. Potato salad was fresh and tasty.  The crab cakes looked substantial and delicious! Very nice server. Will be back."}
{"text":"A great place to spend a summer evening - good food sitting next to Lake Norman.   Good and attentive service."}
{"text":"Took my wife here for her birthday.  I ordered the special, beef and shrimp skewers with blue potatoes .  My order showed up cold. Since it was my wife's birthday, I did not want to comment in front of her.  I asked her how hers was, and she said great, but not as hot as she liked."}
{"text":"Did you ever look at a girl or guy and fantasize what a date would be like?  Finally went and was disappointed? Location-Location-Location - oh wait a minute that's real estate. Well the real estate at this restaurant is wonderful. The view of the lake is very nice. I suggest go relax and have a drink. The menu isn't great but sufficient. The food is better then average but not great.  One person in our party ordered something and asked if she could have bread. The answer was they didn't have any. Sandwiches were on the menu as well as burgers. We don't have bread? This waitress was not customer friendly. Worth a visit but not at all a great restaurant. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  After Church today, my wife and I decided on North Harbor Club from Brunch.  This is one of our favorite restaurants on the lake by car or by boat.  In this case it was by car.  We got there just before they opened at 11:00 and there was already a line for out door seating. It was a beautiful day with temperatures in the low 80's at that time and a nice gentle breeze off of the water.  My wife wanted to dine inside so we were seated in the main dining room.  Not many people inside because it was such a beautiful day.  I ordered the green tomato, bacon \"BLT' panini while my wife ordered pastrami springrolls. Both were excellent.  Service as usual was great. Very attentive but at the same time, not obtusive,  It was a great way to spend some time on the lake."}
{"text":"Great lake shore pit stop with an awesome beer list chocked full of local brews, a large patio and deck to take in the lake and live music.  As far as dinner, unfortunately I can't comment, but based on the looks of dishes passing us by while we watered down and enjoyed the sunset, the food is pretty good, if only nicely prepared."}
{"text":"This was our first time and we really enjoyed our meals.  The burgers were huge and the sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"If you like the food here, you probably haven't tasted fine cuisine or cooked a meal that was not frozen. If just salt and pepper, cheese and fried food can satisfy your tastebuds then this is our place. Location is good but what a waste of space.  If this was just a pub I would be fine but the head chef does not do justice to the food."}
{"text":"What a wonderful atmosphere and view outside! I loved the ambiance and service on a pretty busy spring Sunday. I'll be back but I do hope the food gets improved/tweaked to make this a 4 star review. I had the shrimp and grits, and it wasn't bad but it was lacking seasoning (it didn't look like it was...but it tasted that way). Perhaps it just needed some salt?  I'm not sure but the flavors just didn't come through. My husband had the chipotle burger I think (maybe it was poblanos? some type of chili) and he said the choriza and chili taste was great but the actual burger meat was very bland. Easy fixes but without seasoning I can't give this restaurant a higher rating. I would recommend trying it though!"}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is the view.  The food wasn't bad - it was ok - it wasn't worth the price in my opinion.  Again, the view must be what they are charging for.  Our son had shrimp and grits which were a bit oily.  Our other son had a burger which came out with cold fries.  My husband and I shared the The Dock which was good.  We will be back but not because of the food."}
{"text":"We came on a pretty busy night. I've been craving the mac n cheese for the longest time, but this time around it was a little different from what I remembered. I think the cheese was a little light compared to what I remembered. Anyways, I've reviewed this place before so see my previous reviews.  I'll get straight to the food because this time they had a special that I ordered. Their specials for this holiday was a special bacon wrapped stuffed pork loin with candied bacon and sweet mash potatoes. The size wasn't overwhelming, however the greens was inedible as they soaked it with vinegar which made it pretty hard to eat, at least for me. I think if you want it safe I would still go for the pork chop as the most popular choice, but I like to try their specials whenever they have them to switch it up.   I have to say though, the lobster mac and cheese wasn't as great as I remembered it once before and since then I have had better. Crazy. Anyways, definitely still get that and see if you like it, as North Harbor Club's still pretty good."}
{"text":"We come by boat a lot. Great service, outdoor seating and food. Their cocktails and crab cakes are amazing and good to share!"}
{"text":"Sunday lunch menu.    We both ordered the Grown Up Grilled Cheese.   I added bacon!!!!   The Fontina cheese, caramelized onion and mushroom with tomato jam on top is to die for!   The tomato jam is so good, I had to google recipes, I might try to make it myself.  The setting on the lake is so relaxing and calm.  I love this place and will have to go back for dinner, can't wait."}
{"text":"New Years Eve dinner with a group of 10. Absolutely first rate. Special menu was extensive. All the dishes were excellent, presentation, taste and service were wonderful. Our server Steve was great. A restaurant that can perform so flawlessly on such a busy night deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"My first five star rating! :) I came her last year in the Spring, and I would never forget it.  It was a gloomy and pouring rain kinda day, but nothing was going to stop me from having brunch at the North Harbor Club! It was a very foggy drive down to restaurant.  We parked and it was pouring rain but we ran in.  It was raining pretty hard so we couldnt sit outside.    I ordered the eggs benedict which was AMAZING and my boyfriend ordered the shrimp and grits.  After eating eggs benedict from here, I would always try to find another eggs benedict up to par with this place.  It was just the perfect two poached eggs on two crab cakes with a delightful hollandaise sauce!   The shrimp and grits were just okay, but I'm sure my boyfriend was waiting for me to eat all that I can, so he could finish the rest of my plate! I cant wait to move down to Charlotte, North Carolina so i can come here for brunch whenever I can."}
{"text":"Stopped by here around 4:30 pm on a Sunday afternoon and was quite disappointed with the service received. Our waiter didn't show up after ten minutes of us being seated. We asked a couple times to bring us water and he took his fancy time doing that. We ordered an apetizer and a few drinks and never offered us silverware or napkins and didn't care one bit to check on us. The place is overhyped and not as great as the reviews rave. Ain't coming back"}
{"text":"Nice place! Perfect for an upscale lunch.  Pros? -Asparagus fries! (asparagus coated in tempura batter) -Attention to detail with the dishes -Reasonable prices for the view and service -Outdoor seating next to Lake Norman during the summer -Awesome service  Cons? -A bit pricey compared to other places in the area -No beer on tap"}
{"text":"Very nice presentation of tasteful food. Attentive server completed the enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"Have never had a bad meal here. Really you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The BLT is fantastic the shrimp and grits a great desserts are awesome nothing bad to say about this place at all"}
{"text":"Love the food, the atmosphere overlooking the lake was breath taking, best food I had all week!  It is a must if you come to Lake Norman!"}
{"text":"NH has a great view of the lake. They are conveniently located by the wine cottage and you  can get there by boat.   I have had most of the things in the menu, but I will tell you, my two favorites....the Butternut Squash Chicken Rigatoni and the Tuna sandwich for lunch!"}
{"text":"I discovered this gem while bringing a special someone out here for a dinner date. The view is absolutely phenomenal since the restaurant sits right on the lake in a secluded setting. The decor of this place is great and I love this place because it is fancy food in a laid back setting. The server was awesome very friendly and very pleasant. Our food was just as great I had the tilapia dish with a salad and it was perfect. If your looking for a place with great food and a view this is the place to be."}
{"text":"3.5* I came here for the lobster Mac and cheese. Maybe it was overhyped for me or I just like my cheese to be stronger and sharper? But I was a bit disappointed. So this review might be a bit biased.   There was a big event happening so they limited the place outside. Understandable, but it also added on to the disappointment.   The apps were good though. And the butternut squash dish was great."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to meal given location and reviews. Greatly disappointed with food. Looked delicious on the menu but tasteless.  Greek salad was made with veggies cut days ago, lump crab cake had no lumps   Lobster Mac and cheese had scraps of lobster  and overall everything was bland, no wow factor. So disappointed to waste our only night in Davidson here :("}
{"text":"What's the big deal here. Overpriced average food at best. We were looking to have a nice meal to end our vacation,so stopped here because of all the good reviews.   3 stars for the view, dessert and drinks.  That's it. Food was bland and overpriced. I have to say, the food had great presentation but lacked flavor. Spinach and artichoke dip was cold. The salmon was dry and tough. The kids pasta was completely flavorless.  My husband had the catfish which was not bad, but still overpriced.  The bread pudding was excellent.  The ambiance was stuffy and non-friendly. Perhaps because we were out-of-towners. I did enjoy the views and the boats pulling in from the harbor.   Probably wouldn't return if in the area again."}
{"text":"My in-laws live in Sherills Ford on Lake Norman and every summer we come and visit them. And every summer we go to the North Harbor Club. And every time we have gone the food was fine and so was the service. Things have clearly gone down hill. Our server was busy so the hostess took our order. Drinks and food. We wait. about 10 minutes later, a male server came to our table to let us know that she lost our order and can he get it again. We gave it again. About 5 minutes the woman who is our server made her first appearance and said, did you guys hear what happened? Okay great. Sorry about that.\" 40 minutes go by. We ask her what the situation with the food was. Before even checking with the kitchen, she says \"we had a really big party, so they are super busy in the kitchen.\"   Okay. Well, can you give us an ETA? Or a bread basket? We had a party of 6 which just rode 45 minutes on our boat to get there and now have waited almost an hour and no food.  She comes back with a bowl of saltine crackers. I could not believe it. How tacky. There are not peanut shells on the floor, therefore saltines are not an acceptable appetizer, thanks.  A full hour goes by. The food arrives and 3 of us who ordered salmon was really undercooked. Like, cut into it and there is sushi inside. My mother in law, who ordered hers well done sent hers back 3 times. My mother in law a true southern belle and is the sweetest, kindest lady. The server was so indignant and rude about her sending the food back. Listen. She asked for it well done. It's $20 salmon, give the woman well done. All you have to do is ask the chef to leave it on longer.  The server told her manager that we were having issues, (I could tell by watching her gesture towards us to him.) At no point did he approach our table. He kept walking by it and staring at us, but never stopped by.  After the meal we were walking out the server (whom we tipped) was standing by the hostess station talking loudly about \" difficult people.\" My father in law waited to talk to the manager, but he never came out. After 5 minutes of waiting, we had to get home as it was getting dark and we were boating back.  I made my living as a server/bartender for 10 years. So I am  not ignorant to how restaurants work. They were having a busy night were everything was clearly coming off the rails. This happens all the time in the restaurant business. However, its how you rectify your mistakes that make people come back.    If the owner is reading this, may I make the following suggestions:  1. Teach your hostess how to rotate the sections. So she doesn't have to \"help.\" 2. Facial piercings on your staff lower the class of your restaurant. 3. Managers need to omnipresent and any guest should be able to spot them quickly. The manager we had tonight was unkempt and wearing an untucked short sleeve shirt. If the average entree is $20, the manager should wear dress slacks, dress shirt and tie.  4. Servers need to feel like their manager can help them. It was very obvious that this girl felt abandoned. 5.If your chef needs to re-fire a dish, the should re-assemble the visual integrity of the dish, not just heat up the fish and put it back on the plate so it looks like a dog's dinner."}
{"text":"I DO like North Harbor Club, ambiance and atmosphere you can sit outside right on the lake, beautiful!!! Also, the food is delicious...my favorites are the Asparagus Fries Appetizer and the Butternut Squash...BUT...and this is a big BUT they seem to pride themselves on having horrible service...it is laughable!! They seem to aim to be rude and unaccomadating....every visit...every time..luckily after a couple of glasses of wine...you forget and enjoy the food, view and the company!"}
{"text":"NHC has a great and reasonably priced brunch. The food is excellent (try the mashed potato omelette) and the wait is never too long."}
{"text":"Reubens are worth the visit. A bit pricey, but the view is really nice, especially on a day date! They actually know what an Arnold Palmer is. Don't have to explain that to your waitress/waiter, that is a good day."}
{"text":"My husband and I continue to go back every week for the past month and continue to be impressed with the food and portion sizes are well worth the price. Not to mention the gorgeous lake view from the patio.. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"The view was great. The staff was on the ball and provided excellent service. The drinks were also very good. However we were very disappointed with the food. All entrees ordered were a disappointment. They sound over the top on the menu. We drove 90 miles for the experience and we were very disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"This restaurant/ bar is ideally located in Davidson on Lake Norman with both ample parking and dock space. There is also much outdoor dining space where you can enjoy your meal and the view. It was upwards of 95 degrees the afternoon we were there so we enjoyed our drinks and appetizers inside in the comfort of the air conditioned yacht club atmosphere. They concocted delicious Long Island ice teas for my wife and myself and presented us with a masterly crafted artichoke dip and  homemade chip platter that was a work of art to behold. We both look forward to another visit when in the area and would be tempted to try their much acclaimed Sunday Brunch. Regardless of the time of day, the North Harbor Club is a beautiful and relaxing place to spend some quality time."}
{"text":"Really great service and very nice staff. We went for  Easter brunch and the food was really good but there weren't too many main vegetarian options. We will definitely be back for drinks and the environment. I definitely suggest sitting outside!"}
{"text":"Our friends took us here for breakfast a while back, and though it took us two years to remember to go back I'm very glad we did. There's really nothing better than a delicious breakfast on a weekend morning sitting next to Lake Norman. To me, it's just as relaxing as sitting by the ocean.  The menu has your standard upscale brunch fare for average prices. My favorite dish BY FAR is the crab benedict. Lump crab meat with perfectly creamy hollandaise on top of a potato hash? YESSSS. Also, make sure to try their link sausage; it's fantastic.  The wait staff here is also excellent; my only gripe would be with the hostesses they've hired. Their attitude and helpfulness pretty much lives up to what you'd expect from high schoolers.  Never mind the hostesses, though. This place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I came here Sunday with a group of 7 for my sister's birthday brunch. First, let me say that I called about 4 times regarding the reservation (to make it, to confirm, then to adjust). Each time I called, the hostess, or whoever answered the phone, was just rude! She sounded like she was doing me a huge favor by taking a reservation. Ugh.   Anyway, they seated us right away and didn't mind that we had a couple of gifts with us for my sister. The menu is broad with lots of choices that sounded good. I ended up getting the wild mushroom and goat cheese frittata, and probably got the best thing at my table. The frittata was very large (compared to other's portions) and the biscuit was flaky. The bacon and the potatoes, though, were cold. I hate getting cold food at a restaurant. We also had some mimosas and Bloody Marys (salty, but really delicious)  Other people liked their meals, but I don't think the food was anything outstanding. The waitress was really lovely, though. I brought a bunch of cupcakes to give to my sister (she is gluten-free, so I knew ordering a birthday dessert from a restaurant would be a challenge), and the waitress took all the cupcakes to the back and lit candles for us. It was very special.   All in all, NHC is great for outdoor seating, but I think dinner is a better bet than brunch...If you're willing to head to Charlotte for your weekend breakfast, do it."}
{"text":"Great service, nice atmosphere.  Not fond of the 92 sanitation rating.  Asperges fries incredible but downhill after that.  Food wasn't  bad, but for the price, nothing special.  Would not return."}
{"text":"Visited the North Harbor Club for lunch.  I have been there before and the quality is always present.  I usually come here for business lunches and to enjoy the scenery.     I had the tuna sandwich which is my go to when I come here.  Basically it is medallions in a role with a good sauce and small jalapeños. Good and spicy.  My business partner had the special heirloom tomato sandwich with bacon.   It looked really good and he was satisfied with his choice.     Our server was attentive but not overbearing.   Empty plates never sat around and the drinks were always full.   Can't ask for better.     The atmosphere is really nice.  It is situated right on the lake that provides a great view.   Especially in the summer when the weather is good.   Would recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is always consistent. I have been here many times and the food and service is always excellent. We frequent this restaurant on Sunday's for brunch often because I just love their croissant French toast! A must try if your in the area. Prices are reasonable for lunch and brunch, dinner is more expensive like other fine dining restaurants."}
{"text":"Ate here last week for a work lunch and contracted food poisoning likely from some undercooked chicken in my mixed green salad. Very dissatisfied to say the least."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience here yesterday. Service was fast and friendly. And the food I ate was good. There is a large patio to enjoy the lake views. Inside is much smaller than outside, looked deceiving at first. But heck, your going to want to eat and drink outside anyways. And yes, there is a boat dock if you want to stop in."}
{"text":"I came around sunset and the atmosphere was amazing. This restaurant is located right by the harbor and has a great view. The lights by the dock are beautiful and the atmosphere is mostly casual but the customers are usually dressed well. The food tastes very good and the whole place seemed classy"}
{"text":"North Harbor Club handled our son's rehearsal dinner as well as the Sunday brunch the day after the wedding. The food was fabulous and the service was awesome. We thought that folks would trickle in for the brunch, but most came within a half hour. More tables were needed, and that didn't even frazzle the staff. I would highly recommend private parties at North Harbor Club."}
{"text":"Went on a mid-week night, there were not that many people in the restaurant.  Was seated right away.  The wine list is really good!  We ordered the Seared Mediterranean Tuna and the Beef & Reef.  I expected the tuna to come with a warm sear, but it was served room temp and even slightly cold, flavor was kind of bland.  The Beef was ordered MedRare and was over cooked.  The shrimp were also really over cooked.  I would expect better attention to the food when the dining room wasn't crowded.  Overall, just an average dinner experience."}
{"text":"I was here a few weeks back with a rather large group and the place was at least 80% full.  That was where I thought the staff would struggle but they didn't.  They kept up with food and drink orders and didn't skip a beat.  The food was quite good and the interior was pretty nice, but standard in my opinion.  The location of this place makes it a little hard to find for folks new to the area.  It's tucked away a bit from where you might park."}
{"text":"It is a nice place with a really nice atmosphere. I had salmon and it was average. I didn't care for the Kale and side it came with. I would prefer a baked potato or rice pilaf.  I will go back and try  one of the dishes that my friends had. They looked nice.  The bar is nice and overall a fine place. I will be back."}
{"text":"It doesn't get much better than sitting on a deck overlooking a beautiful lake & chowing down on some very good food. This is our 3rd or 4th visit since discovering this gem 3-years ago. The cocktails are excellent & innovative. Our waiter John could not have been nicer. These folks have their act together."}
{"text":"Here it is, my 400th review, and it couldn't come at a more pleasant surprise and deserving place! North Harbor Club sits right next to I-77 on Lake Norman just outside of Charlotte, NC.  If you ever pass this way, like me, you've seen a ton of nice boats docked here but had no idea it was a restaurant!  On a recent pass through, we yelped, saw it was a restaurant, knew it was a beautiful day, and popped in!  What a pleasant surprise as this scene is gorgeous!  I beg you to go on a beautiful day and sit outside to consume the views of Lake Norman and the nice boating activity. There's plenty of outdoor seating, plus some very nice lounge style outdoor space to sit comfortably for hours with friends enjoying drinks!  We started with a bottle of wine and a rarity for them, fried calamari!  The calamari isn't normally on the menu, but this day it was, and it was fantastic!  Lightly battered with a fantastic accompanying sauce made this a superb dish! We then ordered the Lobster Mac as a appetizer, seeing how popular it was, and was quite pleased with this creamy and rich rendition of a seafood dish!  No sooner than we finished, out came our Caesar and Fried Catfish entree.  The Caesar was perfect and the Catfish, was let's just say it's not your \"NC fried seafood establishment\" kinda meal.  It was so nicely presented with a excellent slaw and tarter rendition that you just wondered why they didn't bring you two more orders! Those living in the Charlotte area, count yourselves lucky, as North Harbor is the place to go for a bit more of a upscale seafood experience with excellent service, nice amenities, and splendid views!   Back for the Easter Brunch Buffet and left thoroughly impressed!!  For a Buffet setting, knowing quality seems to suffer, they did a phenomenal job of keeping the quality high!"}
{"text":"OK.  It was all right but had a much better steak at 131 Main (consistently).  Wanted fries with my steak and the waitress said 'the chef won't put fries on a steak plate'.  Prima Donna?  Whole thing was average."}
{"text":"Came here expecting a great view, got a great view and a great meal. There fries were excellent, the burger slightly under cooked but had all the perfect items on it. My wife ordered a cubano and it was delicious as well. If you're looking for a casual place along the water, this is the spot."}
{"text":"For the cornburbs, this is a great place by the Lake.  Warmer temps make the deck and couch seating area on the far side is a great place for a drink, though it can be a bit of high traffic when the place is packed.  Food continues to be very good, though some dishes are a bit high in price."}
{"text":"If I lived in or around Davidson, I would really be in trouble. This gem on the water provides impeccable service, top notch food, and super reasonable prices.   I came here with friends while in Davidson for a weekend wedding. It was cool (in the 60s) but we sat outside because we're from up north and it was so nice in the sun! Our server was by far one of the sweetest, most polite girls I've ever encountered. We were just looking to get bloody Mary's and snacks while waiting for our hotel room to open up.   Wow, am I glad we picked this place. The have a special section on their menu JUST for bloody Mary's! A few kinds to pick from! All were delicious according to a general consensus at the table. We also opted for the asparagus fries. These are unlike anything I've had, a perfectly cooked asparagus fried in a light and crispy (not greasy) tempura. I'm not sure what the sauce was, but it was so good! Presentation was great, prices were great. Honestly if I live here I would go there ALL the time. The menu looked spectacular and I'm only sad that I didn't get to try more items. The food at the tables around us looked fantastic. This place really knocks it out of the park."}
{"text":"went in for happy hour and had a great time! the greek salad and fried asparagus was soooo good! will def be back and can't wait to visit in the summertime and enjoy the patio!"}
{"text":"came here for Sunday brunch. Let me first say that the food here is amazing. I loved the fried pickles, some of the best I've had, and the mashed potato omelet was amazing!! Only reason for 3 stars is the service. The guy never said his name so I can't say who. The whole brunch seemed so rushed. I noticed after I was waiting forever for a refill that my waiter was also the bartender so when we were ordering drinks and food we felt so rushed because he kept glancing to the bar not really throwing any suggestions out. Also I hate paying for sweet tea when I only got 1 refill and spent my whole meal thirsty. Overall the food and view is amazing but I want good service too so who knows if I'll be back... Maybe they should hire more servers so the bartender can just worry about his bar."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday afternoon for lunch no wait, sat outside, beautiful views. Ali don't think I'd go out of my way to drive there, but when out on the boat I'd def dock the boat and go in for a bite. We got the miso Thai tuna sandwich (DELICIOUS!), fried catfish, burger, and lobster chowder all very good. Quick service which was appreciated because we were with a toddler."}
{"text":"It had been about 8 years since I had eaten here.  Nice atmosphere to have a drink on the patio and enjoy the view of the lake.  The service was slow and the food was ok. Not worth the price even with the atmosphere. A health grade of 92 doesn't excite me either. Stick to having a drink here but eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"Looking for the best steak at the lake?  There are many contenders but I love NHC!  I could be a more complicated guest, but my absolute favorite is the flank steak sides with a fillet substitute and add that bourbon butter...all bets are off!  I recommend medium prep for the steal...perfection!  Everything here is great and perfectly paired & prepared.  Always a great special too.  Good wine selection & one of the few spots on Lake Norman.  Reservations recommended!    Brunch on Sunday is always a huge hit.  Especially, when the weather allows outdoor seating.  One of the best brunches in LKN!"}
{"text":"Amazing views and a great spot for brunch, lunch or just some \"docktails\". No complaints on food, service or drinks. Will continue to be one of our favorite spots!"}
{"text":"The 3 stars is only because of the poor service, the food is 4-5 stars all day! This place is great, food is good, and the location is beautiful. The management / ownership really needs to focus on training the service staff to be more attentive and professional. I've eaten here 2 times in the last month, and both times servers were \"Applebee's\" quality and service was the same. I compliment the chef on the menu! Everything so far has been great."}
{"text":"What an excellent dining experience.  The staff was friendly, accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu. Great food prepared well. An excellent choice for a wonderful Saturday night dinner! The scallop appetizer and beet salad were delicious but so was the shrimp cocktail and the brownie."}
{"text":"Let me preface this with saying I am a New Yorker so I think my expectations were slightly higher. It was a nice restaurant, they had seating by the water which was nice but it was humid out so we sat inside-nothing very fancy but still nice. The service was very attentive. I ordered salmon and my husband the chicken breast. Both were very good. As for the Greek salad I would not classify it as a greek salad, it barely had any dressing and the lettuce was all arugula. I ordered the grilled asparagus as a side and it wasn't even seasoned, just very bland so I asked for some balsamic vinegar to dress it up. The heirloom tomato appetizer was a special they were offering that night and was not that bad just very small. Overall not bad, I would come back."}
{"text":"Went here for a lunch meeting today and really enjoyed it!  What I like is that they take basic dishes (i.e shrimp cocktail/spinach artichoke dip/ asparagus) and make them something special- they put a twist on it. I am reminded of Top Chef when contestants are asked to put a new spin on an old favorite.   The chilled shrimp appetizer was delicious! I loved all of the sauces (2 unique one classic cocktail) - I wish there were more shrimp in the portion because it was so tasty.  Asparagus Fries- huge asparagus stems covered in a light tempura served with soy vinaigrette and aioili - wow- just awesome!  Spinach Artichoke dip - with yucca chips- nice!  Flat Iron Steak (my meal) excellent flavor- cooked well.   Prices seemed extremely reasonable   Beautiful location, friendly efficient service. An excellent choice for a lunch meeting.  Wish it were closer to Uptown but the beautiful view of the harbor makes it worth the drive."}
{"text":"Nice view, poor management.  We ate there last weekend, had reservation for over a week, there early.  Still given a bad table.  Desserts were good, but next time we will look for another place that appreciates our business more."}
{"text":"What a beautiful place inside and out.! The view is lovely! The staff is friendly and helpful. The crab salad was very good."}
{"text":"Tucked away is this fantastic restaurant by the water.  Its a pretty restaurant with , just next to the water. You can dine indoors or outdoors. We stayed in to avoid the seasonal spring pollen.  The service is attentive and warm. The hostess and waitress was efficient and welcoming. The menu is traditional american fare, but done very well. I had their filet mignon, and it was tender and done perfectly. Good beefy goodness without the extra sauces and condiments to hide the beefy taste. I would say it rivals the steak at Ruth C or Capital G.    I rarely go for desserts, but since they did such a good job with the entre, I decided to try their Creme Brulee and it was done correctly as well. Simply delicious.  Bottom line, a restaurant well worth visiting."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and waiter was great... HOWEVER, the end to our dinner was horrible!!! New Year's Eve we were promised a champagne toast by one of the staff on the phone. The manager argued with us and made us feel belittled. The worst part- We had just filled out our checks with drinks still full and the other manager came over and asked us \"Can you guys please hurry up because we have a 15 top waiting!\" EXCUSE ME!!?? Never have I ever been asked that, especially not at a nice restaurant with 10 people and over a $1,000 bill. We have always come for birthdays and events (along with other guests at our table), but will NEVER be back!! And I will tell everyone how horrible this restaurant is."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot next to the water. I came first to get in line when it opened because I heard that there are no reservations for outside  My family came later. That was a good decision because we got a table close to the water. The place got full quickly  I liked that there were so many umbrellas so that we sat in the shade The staff was attentive and friendly  The salad with crab cake was good.   That I would get again. The pancakes were light and warm. Good scrambled eggs. So was the salmon I wish I could get a Bloody Mary but according to North Carolina law I was too early  The place is kid friendly and got good service I thought the portions for the fried pickles and asparagus were too small for their price and I won't get those again This is a good choice if the weather   We will come again"}
{"text":"Very nice view. Food was great. Had the house salad (greens, dried cranberries and candied walnuts) GREAT! Lobster chowder was just ok. Service was extremely quick. We will be back"}
{"text":"A great bar and restaurant tucked away in Davidson right off of I-77 with a great view of Lake Norman. I would bet that one could also arrive by boat if they lived on the lake."}
{"text":"Great evening. Super service. Scallops were perfect. Nice ambiance.  Only need to serve a half glass of wine!"}
{"text":"Great location and the food is delicious. Wait staff are friendly and efficient. My only concern would be for vegetarian or vegans. My friend is a vegetarian and found beacon in the home fries order, the wait staff only apologized.  I ordered the shrimp - appetizer and it was fresh and delicious. We were unable to taste mint that was an ingredient in the cucumber/mint tea. Still good. The key lime pie was delicious/ very sm slice.  Definitely portion controlled. Lol"}
{"text":"Being a traveler, it was a nice stay while the rush hour traffic cleared out.  Wonderful food and view!"}
{"text":"I've always had a good experience here. The outdoor patio is great on nice days! The service has been fast and friendly which is always a plus.  I love filet and crab ;) so I have had the Filet and crab cakes both were cooked perfect. Seasoning was great... not too much or too little. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch. Asparagus fries are a must! Friendly service and beautiful setting."}
{"text":"I am such a fan of this place... and I keep trying to branch out!  I would first like to say that their lobster Mac is probably one of the best things you will ever taste.. along with their asparagus fries!  And secondly, I will mention that some dishes are definitely better than others!! BUT, for the location and the view, the price seems pretty spot on, and the drinks (The French 77) are to die for!  I would highly recommend anyone giving this place a try, but I would also recommend you have a bite or two of the other dishes at the table.. just in case theirs is the \"better than others\" dish!"}
{"text":"NHC is a very solid choice for dinner in the Davidson/Huntersville/Mooresville area.  The location on Lake Norman is really nice (though the traffic speeding by on the interstate is a bit of a downer), and the restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere.  I have eaten at NHC for lunch and dinner, and I prefer the food and the atmosphere at dinner.  I have never had a bad entree or sandwich at NHC, but I also have never been overwhelmed by a dish.  It is a very solid choice for a relatively quiet, pleasant dinner."}
{"text":"I love this place food was good, the view was one of the kind. Run away from traffic and just chill here was not a bad idea"}
{"text":"A good place for outdoor dining, great key lime pie"}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop by when leaving Charlotte to the North. We were in downtown Davidson and looked this place up on Yelp and decided to stop in for lunch and we were both glad we did!  We were seated right on the water overlooking the Marina and it really felt like we were somewhere on the coast. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and my wife got a salad. Both lunches were awesome! Totally recommend this place!   I thought this place might be popular just because it was on the water, but the food was great in itself and they let us stay longer than we probably should have because we were talking and enjoying the view."}
{"text":"Generous rating, but only because of mixed experiences.   First experience: Sat outside on a warm day. Good service. Good food.   Second experience: Sat inside on a cold day. Good service. Good food.  Third experience: Sat inside on a mild day (not kidding). Bad service. Supbar meal. What really stood out was a roach crawling on the wall behind us AND a wine glass with a previous drinker's lipstick on it. Appetizing? Not quite. Dare to return? Not sure. Probably not. Roach sitings don't often lead to a desire to eat food.   Too bad. The location is a 10."}
{"text":"Enjoyed this he Food, Bloody Mary's, and service but not the dirty water glass with lipstick on it."}
{"text":"Had a great time. Food was great. The waiter was prefect. Enjoy. Had crabcake salad and asparagus app. Both was unbelievable"}
{"text":"My friend and I had branch here, food is ok, but not the best. Service was not execrable, we ordered slice of bread with our meal, and they denied as!  Seriously, you serve sandwiches with bread and not bringing me a slice after I pointed out bread on other tables! Not coming back here again!"}
{"text":"This is \"the place\". Every thing we order here is prepared and served deliciously.  Very accommodating and attentive servers."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of going here with Chelsea J. and her parents last week right before Thanksgiving and the food here was sooooooo good!  I had a delicious tuna steak that was baked with sesame seeds on top and came with a mango salsa and some veggies.    The place is really nice.  The atmosphere is very calm and warm.  And it's right on the water which is really cool.  There were lots of boats and stuff and a condominium complex that looked over the water.    Our waiter was really nice and friendly too which is always good.    Oh and the wine was really delicious.    I had a great time here and can't wait to get back to Davidson so we can go again.    Delicious!"}
{"text":"We had the perfect Sunday brunch here. There is plenty of outdoor lakeside seating. I had the best lobster chowder soup and shrimp. The service was excellent and the hostess was very professional and kind. They were very busy and the gentleman who served us was very knowledgeable & always came back in a timely manner. Would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service!!! Only one waitress on the patio & she took great care of our family. My BLT sandwich was delish!  Great beer selection. The inside looked really nice too. The burgers were good too."}
{"text":"I love sitting outside by the water here! Beautiful setting except for interstate in view. We had excellent service and food. I had the wedge and scallops. My husband had the pork chop. Both were very good. Really no complaints."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT BRUNCH -ONLY 2 COMPLAINTS: near perfect... We love-love-love North Harbor Club for SUNDAY BRUNCH! If you like quality food, and a killer eggs Benedict, theirs is exceptional.  For years we've been recommending this place for brunch. Great location, friendly staff (Krissy is our fave!), great management, takes reservations, offers occasional coupons to encourage new guests and to bring back others, and MOST IMPORTANTLY, great food!  However, there are two requests that we wish the owners would consider in order to be more competitive and to raise the bar, especially with new competitors I the area like Bonefish...  PLEASE change your house from Aristocrat! It's disappointing this is your choice for house. And please start carrying some kind of jam or jelly other than apricot. Surprised there aren't more options; kids will not eat that apricot jelly. And would love to see you go back to serving your Benedict on two halves vs one big one. You guys execute the classic Benedict better than ANYONE in the CLT area... Please keep it up!!!!  If you could change these three things, you could easily become the best brunch establishment in all of Greater Charlotte. Please give it some consideration. Thanks!!! :)"}
{"text":"The Brunch is amazing and if you have a coupon its 1/2 the cost. Be early if you plan on dining outside as there is a line by 11:15 on a Sunday. I will say watch and look at your bill. We had a 66.00 bill and I only glanced at the total as we were with guests. So I tipped on the total of 80.00 and put down a 20.00 tip. I later wondered why it was so high and realized they had already put a 20% tip on. so I would up giving a 35.00 tip on a 66.00 bill. Crazy. I did call but they only took off the lower tip of 14.00 which means I tipped about 32%. The waitress was ok, but not worthy of that in my books. I love the place but that left a bad taste in my mouth. If she had been at least friendly I would have said well it was her day, but we have had nice staff. Food wise the place is amazing and the atmosphere is wonderful. One of our favorite places to bring relatives when they come to visit"}
{"text":"I love the North Harbor Club! I work in the Davidson area, and this is by far my favorite lunch spot. Every thing I have had has been great! I personally recommend the Grown Up Grilled Cheese, the Wedge Like Salad, and the Queso Fundido Burger. Service is always very good. It's a great place to go in the Spring/Summer if you sit outside!"}
{"text":"I love a restaurant with a view. This place has a great view! Who doesn't love the calm sound of the lake water crashing against a pier? No seriously, if you are #lknlife all the way, this is your paradise.   Anyway, on to the review. My last visit to North Harbor Club was for a quick Sunday brunch prior to heading south for some shopping adventures. My party of 3 ordered a couple of appetizers for the table and mimosas all around.   The asparagus fries were delicious! Honestly, if you fry any vegetable go ahead and count me in for the meal. We also ordered the fried pickles or as I like to refer to them as \"Frickles\". They were superb. No complaints on the food.   The mimosas were strong. I don't know if they are always that way but after 2 glasses I was just happy I wasn't driving that day.   Overall it is a great place to grab some good tapas and drinks and enjoy a the sunshine and atmosphere of Lake Norman. I've never been inside the North Harbor Club, but why would you when there's an amazing view on the patio?!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to North harbor club for her birthday it was our first time. We really enjoyed having dinner on the harbor, the food, and the service was great. We had a great time."}
{"text":"We have been enjoying North Harbor Club for many years.  Unfortunately, lately, we have been continually disappointed when dining here!!  The menu is in need of a makeover.  Tired selections that don't hold a candle to many restaurants.  If it weren't for the waterfront dining, this place would have gone out of business many years ago. We sat at the bar inside several times and were so annoyed.  They were not even close to busy; yet, we waited forever for our drinks.  The bartenders were anemic.  No personality and on the rude side. Tonight, we decided to dine at North Harbor only because it was a beautiful evening.  Again, we were so disappointed in the food.  Our appetizers were awful.  But we stayed.  Husband ordered pork chops and I ordered catfish (fish and chips).  Pork chops were ok.  Fried catfish was a joke.  I have ordered this many times over the years and it was about the only consistent item on the menu.  Tonight, it was awful!!   We got the spinach-artichoke dip with dipping chips.  The chips were stale and hard and I nearly broke a tooth trying to bite it.  We ate the rest of the dip with our forks.  Then, since I was hungry, we ordered the bruschetta.  How can you go wrong with that??!!  Well, they did.  Basically a big slice of French bread with big slices of tomatoes and skimpy, thin slices of mozzarella.  We tried to cut it into bite sizes.  The crust was sort of crispy , but the rest of the bread wasn't.  We could barely cut it.  So, again, we ate the toppings with our forks and left the chunk of bread. Also, I have learned to not order the lobster macaroni!!  Over the past TWO years, the lobster became less and less!!  Maybe a sliver or two in the macaroni.  Lately, I have politely requested that they add a bit of lobster to the macaroni.  Usually, I get a cold stare at my request.  Last time I ordered it, last week, no lobster!  Not even a hint of taste of lobster!!  And, they are now using rigatoni pasta instead of the round, soft pasta.  Cheap.  How they can pass this off as lobster macaroni...I don't know.  Capital Grill--now THAT's lobster macaroni!!  Claws and all!!!   Anyway...thank goodness we didn't bring friends.  We would have been embarrassed!!  The fish was soggy, not golden brown and NOT crispy--at all!!!  It was gross!!  I sent it back and the waiter was very nice.  He said he asked the cook to change the oil.  Brought it back out and it was the same!!  Yuck!!  We asked to speak to the manager.  She was pretty much, well, not helpful.  Seemed clueless to my description of what fried fish should be like.  I seriously could have made it better myself!!  The manager simply said \" we have a new fry chef and perhaps he doesn't know...\"  Really??!!!  Very, very disappointed!!  We left shortly after and I was hungry.  We ended up going to another restaurant so I could eat.  I was starving!!  Besides the waterfront view, North Harbor has been a huge dining disappointment for close to a year!!  They need a menu and cook makeover--BIG time!!!!   One of the worst food experiences ever.  Sigh...."}
{"text":"I have only been once. Had the Eggs Benedict, which was pretty good. Loved the view. Super service, very friendly waitress."}
{"text":"TL;DR... It's a pretty scene with pretty food.  I highly recommend brunch.  I equally suggest going with the buffet.  Meat and potatoes and eggs and waffles and omelets and chocolate dipped strawberries, oh my!  Dinner is equally good.  Lobster mac 'n cheese is always a win, as is any type of pasta and seafood, crab cake, or salmon.  Saw some complaints about the hostesses on here, but they seem nice though?  I've never had any problems.  Usually have a few waiters bouncing around, filling drinks, etc.  Service is great.  You get what you need without feeling like someone is hovering.  It's like a country club located right on the water... if you want to take a boat over, you can.  There's indoor and outdoor seating, a dining area, and bar.  I imagine it's a pretty good place to host events at.  I would, if I had anything to host.  My dad and brother are frequent (as in weekly, if not daily) patrons, and they keep coming back for more.  No wonder, since the food is good and the place is nice.  I could think of much worse places to go.  All in all?  I like it.  Ah'll be bahck."}
{"text":"Good food, creative menu, watered-down drinks. This was our first time here, and we will certainly be back. (If the drinks get better, I'll update this review.) Beautiful location, nice place, good servers."}
{"text":"What's going on with N.H.C!?  Possibly NEW management, different chef OR are they simply asleep at the helm!? :(   SOOOO disappointing that our dinning experience took such a nose dive from our previous 5 Star dinning experience.   The charcuterie platter was in such a sad state of affairs ...it lacked everything! Refer to pic's, you will see for yourselves that it seems as if it was preassembled by a toddler :/ Horrible plating job!  Come on guys, where is the care!? NO compote, no fig spread, or anything to tie in the points? We had to request homemade jam, why not ADD a great spread to the platter? The jam that we had to request (ourselves) was actually quite nice.   Thank goodness their is a water view as that helped. I HOPE they start to place more attention on their food.   Fast forward to dinner ...unfortunately my hubby's dinner was not great :( NOT for this level of restaurant as it was void of flavors. Boring! Nothing worth mentioning as the dish was \"meh\" ...just average nothing memorable.   I wish the views matched the cuisine, great water views although the cuisine was mediocre.   Will give them another shot, if we don't taste a notable improvement will be on the search for another water front restaurant.  *Point of attn:  Their menu was very limited ...challenging to select entrees as we were not excited about their mains."}
{"text":"Just visited on the first day of Queens Feast 2014.  Of course, I chose from the special menu.   To start I had the lobster Mac and cheese.  It was so good!  The portion looks small but looks can be deceiving.  It was just enough.  The dish is very rich and creamy. Spruced up comfort food.  The chunks of lobster were just right and the drizzle of truffle oil was a perfect match to balance or add to the rich flavors.   For my entree I had the crab cakes. Those are the largest crab cakes I have ever seen at a restaurant. They were perfectly seared with nice delicate flakes of lump crab meat within.  I could only eat one, that's how enormous they were.  Both served alongside a chickpea mash which was deliciously citrus and garlicky.  A nice long half of a grilled zucchini squash topped with micro greens was balancing on top of both crab cakes.   Lastly, for dessert I chose the banana split.  I was so full by this course that I was unable to fully enjoy it as I could.  However, I stuffed down as much as I could because it was so good.  Banana bread topped bananas topped with a vanilla and a chocolate scoop of ice creams drizzled with chocolate fudge and passion fruit glaze topped with homemade whipped cream topped with a cherry all in a cute martini glass.  Perfection! I had such a great experience tonight!  The staff was friendly, the service was good, the food was ridiculously delicious and the location is beautiful and relaxing.  I will definitely be coming back for more."}
{"text":"I was pretty nervous about taking my mom here for her birthday after reading a few of the reviews, but I'm happy to report that both the food and service were better than expected.   First, the food. I had the filet mignon-- it was cooked exactly to order and the sides (asparagus and potatoes) were well seasoned and prepared. A solid entree but nothing to brag about. Mom's salmon was absolutely delish and I l highly recommend it. Great citrus favors infused there. We also loved the Greek salad. (Hard to believe the salad was so cheap, actually.)   For dessert, we tried the chocolate tasting: four mini desserts, including pot de creme and a couple of brownies/flourless cakes (?). These were pretty good-- one tasted a lot like bubblegum, but otherwise chocolatey goodness with an interesting twist.   The service was decent. Whoever took my reservation is a super unhappy person; meh-- it happens. Our server was young, friendly, and wonderfully not-too-friendly. The service wasn't what you'd call fine dining (rather than just bringing one with the meal, they asked if I wanted a knife to cut my steak, for example), but they were friendly and up to the task.   We sat on the patio-- not an epic view but at least you can see the lake and enjoy eating waterside. Check out Tuesday for half-price wine bottles. (Not that you should EVER pay any more than $6 for a bottle of Salmon Creek, but I was impressed they featured Sean Minor and Spellbound wines by the bottle.)   Overall, a good value for the food, service, and experience. Glad I chose it for our occasion."}
{"text":"We had our wedding rehearsal dinner at the North Harbor Club. We had their boat room set aside for us privately.   I discussed everything with the manager at the restaurant. I found him to be nice and accommodating, although on occasion a bit vague and indirect. But we were able to get everything done: choosing the menu, accommodating dietary restrictions, etc. They have all their info online and they were able to mix and match the menu according to what we needed.  The food was varied and tasty. I was actually so full I could barely eat dessert, and shared mine with others.  The cons: -There is not much of a view from the restaurant. I was hoping it would be over the water. If you want a water view, you need to be outside on the patio.  -it is overpriced. For the setting, type of food, and overall experience, I was expecting a bit more given the price we paid. We were in a bit of a time crunch however, so we had to go with what was available  -when I booked them, I was under the impression there would be a view and access to the outdoor patio, which made the extra cost worth it in my mind. But neither of these were available unfortunately, so we ended up with a slightly above average meal at disproportionately high gourmet prices."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! For an appetizer we had the scallops, and I must say they were the best I've ever had. This made my entree decision rather easy, I went with the shrimp and scallop pasta. We had a big party, 13 people actually but our waitress was great and did an amazing job getting all our orders correct. The only thing that I didnt like was the fact that after it got dark it got pretty cold at the outside table. Maybe if they had those heater lamps it would help."}
{"text":"Again.....a great lunch at North Harbor. They truly go above and beyond to make each visit better than the last. Thank you David Etz"}
{"text":"We've lived here for 8 years and have had dinner at North Harbor a couple times. Mostly in the winter, at night. Who knew it was such a great place for cocktails during the summer??  We'll be back with friends!    It's a great place to watch the sunset and to enjoy a cocktail or glass of wine. We saw some amazing apps going to other customers and will definitely try some next time. Inside the bar, they have some really interesting infused vodkas. Also on the list for next time.   Give it a try - you'll love it at any time!"}
