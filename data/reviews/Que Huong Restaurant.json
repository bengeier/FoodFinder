{"text":"A little bit of whole in the wall but the food was good! Plus, there wasn't wait like the other Vietnamese restaurant up the road."}
{"text":"It's not your regular pho place here. They have some really neat dishes! The Pho Tai Sate is a must try. Ask the beef on the side if you don't want your beef to be soaked in the soup for too long. Ask for less spicy if you are not a big spicy eater like me. The spicy hotness is very similar to the Chinese hot pot type that stings into your tongue so be ready for that. They also have pig hock noodle soup and all sort of rice dishes. If you just want to stick to a regular pho, their pho is pretty good too.  Their soup is really hot (temperature per say) and it's a plus for me. BTW, you can ask for cooked bean sprout. I'm planning to go back there again already."}
{"text":"Go for the banh mi sandwiches alone and branch out from there!  The ratio of meats to pickled veg to bread is just right.  The spring rolls are another gem and I'm going back for the pho next time around.    All in all, a great family owned business where their care and attention shine through."}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese place in las vegas in my opnion.  It beats all of the sf Chinatown pho places. Price wise, portion wise too.  They have authentic food there.  Noodle soup is always hot there.  Their cold noodle with egg rolls are so good.  I just can't believe why no one ever wrote a review for them.  Try it out.  Please!  They need some recognition.  Inside the restaurant is rather simple, but they are definitely cleaner than most pho places."}
{"text":"Rad! I saw that the name changed to \"Que Huong\". This is the same location as Maxim restaurant. We just ate at the new Que Huong for the first time today... Apparently they have a new owner but the same great food (I was worried that I lost one of my favorite local restaurants). They cleaned up the look a little bit and changed the menu a little bit. I'm happy. We had the spring rolls with Tofu: outstanding. We also had spicy pho with vermicelli noodles and beef: Great. The standard meatball pho was great as usual and we had lemon chicken. That's right people! Listen up! While this is a Vietnamese restaurant, their Chinese food seems to be better than any Chinese food restaurant within 15 miles! If you don't want a standard Vietnamese dish and are hungry for Chinese come to Que Huong. I have had about 15 - 20 Vietnamese dishes here (when it was Maxim) and have never had food that I was not happy about. This place is great for take out as well. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Really???. Pho was OK kinda bland  broth so-so well cooked beef ok rare. not-so-friendly service....me thinks over-rated. Didn't try other dishes...must admit saw some that looked good. wasn't empty when i was there.  It wasn't bad....just not all that good.  go try Da Lat! it Lat bettah!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  The food is good and the people are friendly.  The prices are the best in relation to the other Vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas.  Highly recommended.   The pho is good and so are the spring rolls!"}
{"text":"my friend and i was craving for \"mi quang\" and so we searched for a place and came across this restaurant. probably the second best mi quang place i have tried (only because the broth covers the noodles)  FYI: traditional mi quang has soup broth that covers only 1/4 of the noodles, but at this place, the broth covers the whole noodle. just the way i like it.."}
{"text":"I enjoyed having their big combo Pho plus a plate of fried Chinese-style (their description) dimsum with vegetables inside one weeknight dinner time. It's a medium size place, where it seems to me that many regulars come in whenever they are open. Very good service, including a young lady who speaks both English and Spanish."}
{"text":"Great pho! Previously Maxim on 19th, this place is always delicious and has friendly, good service."}
{"text":"Perhaps I'm a little jaded by being in L.A. so long.  I judge a place by how crowded it is.  My favorite Pho spot on sunset is ALWAYS crowded. I arrived at Que Huong after passing several Pho spots to find it, EMPTY.  I figured I came after the lunch rush.    I ordered the Pho Tai (beef rare steak pho noodle soup) and the fresh summer roll with shrimp and pork.  The summer roll was the bomb, and the peanut sauce it came with was akin to crack.  One bite and I couldn't stop myself. . . well I stopped myself from licking the bowl, but that was a lot of self restraint.  There was a hint of coconut which set off the awesome little dish.  I posted a picture, unfortunately I couldn't stop myself from eating one of the little buggers before I snapped a photo.  (note to self:  you may get strange looks for being the only person in the restaurant and taking pictures of your food before you eat) Only in vegas?  But I have to say the ingredients, shrimp and lemongrass were super fresh.    The pho tai came out and the bowl was huge!  Tons of noodles too which I dig.  But alas I must come to the point why I gave it 4 stars.  There wasn't a lot of meat, which is a bummer.  But more of a bummer was there there was NO ambiance to this place.  I could have felt a little less weird if there were music, a tv, any distraction besides being the only person, inhaling peanut sauce, and taking pictures of my food.  Ok, maybe I'm a little weird but someone should bring these folks a boom box.  Or might I suggest bringing your own Mp3 speakers and making a party?    All in all, good pho, awesome summer rolls, I will come back when the pho craving returns and I'm in vegas.    Oh and by the way, the total for the summer rolls, a hot tea, and the pho tai.  $10.45!!!  Maybe I should have given it a 5th star."}
{"text":"So glad to see that this reincarnation of Maxim continues the practice of serving really tasty inexpensive fare with smother-you-with-friendliness service, and with a brighter and tidier dining area this time around. The beef pho I tried is a superior bowl of piping hot goodness - very fresh flavors and they don't skimp on the meat. The broken rice with grilled pork that I enjoyed on another visit made for a very satisfying meal. The garlic chive dumplings are a must-try appetizer; these are a great alternative to the egg rolls or spring rolls that people usually order for starters. This is the place to come to for delicious, hearty Vietnamese or Chinese meals on a budget."}
{"text":"This review is of one item, and one item only. I don't even think the dish is on the hard menu but I come here at least once every two weeks to get it (sometimes twice in during the colder seasons).   The Pho Spicy Beef Sate.  For anyone who likes spicy food and noodles this is a MUST HAVE! It's not like any other pho you have ever tried. The soup is a thick and flavorful broth with chili peppers and onions. There are some cucumbers and tomatoes which I believe is also cooked with the soup. The noodles are soft and satisfying unlike other pho places where they just simply pour hot soup over the pre-packaged noodles and you can still feel the noodles softening as you eat it. The best part about about this dish (besides the soup) is the beef. The beef is so tender and juicy. Usually the beef in pho is chewy and flavorless but the beef in this dish is literally cooking within the soup. All of the textures (noodles, beef, cucumber, tomatoes, onions, chili peppers) blend together so perfectly in this delectable, spicy pho.   * Just a heads up, I do get mine WITHOUT peanuts, bean sprouts, and cilantro (as pictured in the photos) *  The dish is about $7. Be sure to being cash or a couple friends because they do not accept card unless the total is over $20.  But if you have a couple dollars, you're around that area and you're craving something hot, spicy and delicious...be sure to check it out!"}
{"text":"First of all, they don't take credit card sales under $20. I had an order of pho and the broth was decent but a bit on the boring side.  The service was alright when they were around.  The server kept disappearing and I was left sitting and waiting."}
{"text":"PQH is underrated and definitely deserves more attention.    I was sad to walk into an empty restaurant at 8pm on a Sat but based on the reviews, I had to give it a try.   We received excellent service....probably 5 star if you rate against Asian restaurants.  The spring rolls with shrimp and pork were fresh because the rice paper wasn't dry or hard.  Many times, you'll get these at other places which means it was made before.    We ordered the Banh Xeo (crepe with shrimp, pork, bean sprouts) and although the crepe was nice and crisp, it was filled too much with bean sprouts.  It would have been nice to have more shrimp and pork but the flavor was spot on.  The pairing with the pickeled carrots and cucumbers in the lettuce wraps was the perfect combo.  Based on Tomoko's recommendation, we also ordered the Beef Satay with Thick Rice Noodles.  This was super rich as the broth was really thick but was very flavorful.    I'd definiltey come back to try their pho, com (Rice dishes) and more.   I hope this place gets more business.  I believe it's a hidden gem and many of the other Yelp reviewers agree.  It's like finding the younger sister of Pho So 1."}
{"text":"The Pho was excellent!  This is a great family owned place where service is a priority.  We need to keep places like this around!"}
{"text":"I was taken here on a work lunch and I was a little sketched out. I should have known that the best restaurants are located in questionable areas next to hookah bars.  I was a little concerned about the change in ownership but my fears were allayed. Maxim, for the most part, is whole. The service is still friendly, if a little lacking. The portions remain unchanged, enormous and filling. I know the Chinese food is recommended but I can never pass up good pho.  The broth has so much flavor I could almost just have that. The beef is not given in extreme portions, but enough to compliment the rest of the soup.   Just a great experience and a treat."}
{"text":"Very nice people running the place.  They aren't as busy as some of the more popular places in the area (Pho So 1, etc), but they serve great food at decent prices.  About average on the cleanliness for an Asian place.  However, their food is excellent.  Their Pho is great, I've had it a few times and it was excellent - all of their meats (steak/flank/chicken/etc) are good quality and their broth is great.  It's just not in a prime location to attract a lot of traffic, haven't been here in awhile, but planning to go back when I have time."}
{"text":"Vietnamese restaurants can be found in most big cities (except Palm Springs, CA), so why the surprise in Vegas? And there are plenty of them. You have to count with both feet too if you really want to know.  To the point, it served just ordinary Pho. Maybe they are not really Vietnamese since they speak Cantonese.  We were the first customer at 10 AM on a Sat (Wendy's next door was my first choice but it opened at 11). I went straight to the Pho, item #1... the staple of Vietnamese dishes in USA. The broth was light and plain. It looked filtered, so was the flavor. It's a small bowl with pathetic amount of meats, not for the $7 in SoCal. Oop! I forgot. This was the touristy Vegas I'm talking about.  So diners, there are so many options, better options, out there. Do you really want to take a chance on Que Huong?"}
{"text":"Ooooh, I can't wait to come back here and try the pho! The banh mi was to die for. I can't even believe how much I ate!  Some of what passes for good Vietnamese in Vegas, is highly questionable. But this seems to be the real deal!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood is not greatest  Is across from church in a small shopping center, it is clean Not greatest furniture but clean. Bathroom clean as well. Lots on menue. We went for basic beef with tripe etc in it. Came with bean sprouts lime chili cilantro Basil.portions are huuuuge. Small is large"}
{"text":"Simple and delicious! Reminds me of home! Best pho I've had in Las Vegas. AND SUPERB customer service. Very mom and pop type."}
{"text":"Everything is so delicious! I ate here twice, while I was in Vegas. The waiters are alright, but overall, the food is good and decent priced!"}
{"text":"I was going to eat the lunch I brought from home, but a coworker convinced me to get out of the office to get some pho. I am so glad I did--filling portions at a great price.  I started off with the shrimp spring rolls which were stuffed to the brim and came with a lovely peanut sauce. For my entree, I ordered the pho tai. The beef was a bit tougher than I'm used to in my pho, but the broth was divine and the jalapenos spicy.   Although service isn't super attentive, it was friendly and patient. I can't wait until I get another chance to come to Que Huong!"}
{"text":"I'm so shocked this place only have 1 review because hands down they have the best pho in town!  I've been spoiled because I grew up eating my mum's pho, so this is a special treat for me.  They also make IMO the best chao (rice congee), cha gio (egg rolls),  and com bi cha thit nuong (rice plate with grilled pork)  I also hear their banh xeo is really good because my friend always order it when we go there.  I just can't eat it because i'm allergic to shellfish ;( I'm not going to lie, it still does look mighty tasty!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best Banh Xeo in all of Las Vegas. I've tried them all over and so far they are the best. Their Pho is also decent (above average for Vegas)."}
{"text":"They have a delicious broth here but, the decor sucks so bad that it actually prevents me from coming back.  But, if you are a hardcore pho lover this place has great broth, fresh meats, and the noodle are on the thinner side which I prefer.  If I want to keep it on the down low and not see everybody at all the other pho places I come here .  People there don't speak english so, there is alot room to talk business at the table."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!!!! Plus very affordable for taking out the whole family and enjoying them as well as the food"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant based on good Yelp reviews.   As we walked thru the door, we were greeted with a warm smile and a friendly hello.   The staff was very helpful in helping us to choose our meal. These are the nicest restaurant owners I've ever come across. They really want to make your experience a good one.  The restaurant decor is Yellow, with Green Plants, and Red Upholstery. The mirrors on the walls are clean. The table is average showing just a little wear, but still nice.   Pop Rock Music is played, at a moderate volume   I ordered a Spicy Soup Pate, It was pretty tasty. My lady friend ordered a noodle soup and was completely full.  I was not filled up, so much, so I ordered another dish.. BBQ Rice.  Three dishes, and a tip for under $25.00.   The average price is about $6.95 on the menu.  I like it and I will return...   Food is 3.8 stars..  Service is 5 stars! Decor is 3.6 stars.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years (as the original, Maxim) and the new iteration is as delicious as always.   My weekly pho always hits the spot and is a great way to start the week (or put the weekend behind you).  PHO PHACE!"}
{"text":"We visited Las Vegas for the first time and were on our way out of town wanting to get something to eat and not pay an arm and a leg.  A quick search on Yelp Mobile (I wonder how I ever lived without this app) and we were led to Que Huong Vietnamese Restaurant.  After having had Food Court Chinese the night before on Las Vegas strip, I was craving some real food.   My wife and I both had the pork chop with broken rice. Very good and on par with the Vietnamese restaurants in Little Saigon Garden Grove, CA.  Overall a really good meal with  friendly staff at a reasonable price. ~ $17 for both meals with a cafe sua da (Vietnamese Iced Coffee)"}
{"text":"I definitely consider this place one of the better pho restaurants in town. The pho broth is cleaner and heartier, the rare beef is tender, and when I ask for extra jalapenos, they give plenty! I tried their spicy noodles with beef and that was also fantastic... the portion was HUGE. The vermicelli noodles with charbroiled pork and egg rolls (Vietnamese-style salad) is one of my favorites. Prices are reasonable and any of the bowls can be ordered 'supersized' for a small upcharge (;  I will most likely become a regular at this restaurant ;)"}
{"text":"This place has ruin its reputation faster than Tiger Woods. When I came here a while back, I remember reviews being positive but I had my doubts.   After tasting the pho, I knew I had good reasons to be doubtful. The broth and noodles were flavorless. The only saving grace was the rest of the ingredients were acceptable and my Pho did come out hot.  The only way you can have worse service than an Asian restaurant is not even executing the simplest request. I asked the water 3 times till I finally got my first cup of water. Water or some other drink should be given when  you sit down with your menu. The waiter just couldn't remember a cup of water, and there was only 2 other small groups in the restaurant. I'm surprised he actually got the right order.  There are a bunch of other places on Spring Mountain, try one of those instead."}
{"text":"Been living in Vegas for 5 years now and drove by this place so many but always hesitate to try it because the place always looked empty, which is not a good sign. Anyway, my family finally decided to try the place out just to see how their food was. When we walked in, the place was almost empty, even though it's Memorial holiday weekend. The furniture look old and raggy. Anyway, we were there for the food, so furniture didn't matter. We order Bun Thit Nuong, side of EggRoll,and Mi Trieu Chau, along with Soda Xi Muoi (salted plum) and Soda Chanh (soda lemonade). The drinks were so awful, tasted neither like lemonade nor anything good. The soda was flat and just nasty. Moving on to the food. Their food looked and tasted like stale noodle and meat. Their egg-rolls were burned and stored bought (because I bought that same \"made in Vietnam\" egg-roll at S&F market last year). They were not good. Worse, we found ants in the chili paste. Base on the mixed reviews of their Pho from other yelpers, I don't think I will ever be back to this place. Even though Pho#1 doesn't have the best Vietnamese food, it's still has the freshest food in Vegas. One upbeat thing: the waitress was nice and polite, which earns one additional star."}
{"text":"Very good spring rolls. Pho tai was nice and fragrant. Really heavy on the scallions which I liked a lot. Service was quick and smiley. Better then any spot I've been to in NYC or Brooklyn. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for Pho and went here last Sunday. At 5pm I was the only one there. I enjoyed the bowl of Pho with rare steak, ate the whole thing. I remember eating here about 4 years ago and it was good also. Very good pricing. Mother and daughter who own restaurant were very friendly to this dorky looking white guy."}
{"text":"OMG, i think this is the place i ordered banh mi at!!! this place is really good.... i havnt had the pho, but everyone else on yelp seems to love it!  this place is really empty because its on Jones and its really dead in this plaza... not many people know about this place but i wandered in one day looking for hue thai and found this place by accident and IM GLAD I DID.   The bread here is really goooooood. They don't have many banh mi choices but the ones they make is SUPPPPPPPPPERRR GOOD... one of the best i've had so i am absolutly a FAN OF THIS PLACE!  cant wait to try the rest.   I HIGHLY RECOMMEND"}
{"text":"Great place with amazing lunch specials.   Food is terrific and the service is fast.  The menu has a range of  Vietnamese dishes especially soup bowls that are great. They also have dishes everyone would recognize and likes, chicken with vegetables, pepper beef,  shrimp and veggies. Egg rolls are great too!"}
{"text":"Same workers and chef, menu is the same with a facelift than when the previous restaurant was Maxim  #29 Wonton Noodle Soup is solid  #44 would also recommend if not interested in soup  Kind of hidden but a nice hole in the wall for authentic Asian dishes with no frills and nothing fancy.  Just solid inexpensive food."}
