{"text":"Their lunch special during weekday is very good deal. For $5, you can get a lot of food and their chip is pretty good."}
{"text":"I visited El Toro Loco with my husband. It was a very nice experience. We chose it because he wanted to eat somewhere that had reasonable steak and i  wanted to eat somewhere fun. We were both very pleased!  It was a little intimidating because of the amount of ramps. You see my husband is a paraplegic and I  had fallen at a gas station(Casey's) and sustained multiple injuries, so I was also in a wheelchair at the time. There were many ramps to get into the restaurant and many more to avoid any seating only accessible by steps. The employees were more than willing to help push me and him up and down them to get to our table and to leave. The food was delicious! The atmosphere was fun! The staff was friendly! If it was more handicapped accessible they would have gotten five stars. I love their salsa! And their margaritas are very reasonable! Just probably won't be back too many stairs and too many ramps. Maybe we will do carry out."}
{"text":"It's a lot of food for the money.  Chips were decent, but the salsa didn't really have any kick at all.  The quality was decent, but overall the food left something to be desired--I find places like Maize and El Charro to be a better option if you're ok with not having a sit-down atmosphere.  Service was quite slow, especially given that it was the end of the night--it took at least 20 minutes for them to take our cash/cards after we were given checks."}
{"text":"We had heard good things about El Toro, and wanted to try it. Some friends gave us a gift certificate, which we used recently.   Positives: (1) The hot salsa our waiter brought us was to die for. Wonderful! (N.B. We had to ask for it--the mild salsa they give you when you arrive is bland and unappetizing). (2) There are televisions EVERYWHERE (but aren't TVs a sine qua non of Mexican restaurants?), which in itself is annoying--but the good thing about them is that they keep the sound either way down or off, the net result being that the restaurant is relatively quiet. And we like quiet.  Negatives: (1) The chips were OK, but not even in the same league as those at Don Juan's (disclaimer: Don Juan's has made major changes to their operation, and we haven't returned since they did that, so any comparisons I make are to the old version of Don Juan's, which was for many years Mas Amigos). And El Toro offers only the one hot salsa, not two (plus pico de gallo) as Don Juan's used to provide. (2) The enchiladas were pretty poor tasting. I had cheese enchiladas, and they consisted of nothing but melted white cheese inside a tortilla (no onions), covered by a watery, translucent pink sauce that tasted (I do not exaggerate!) sort of like something from a Boyardee can. Neither my wife nor I could finish our enchiladas, and neither of us wanted to take home what was left. (3) My wife had something whose name I have forgotten, but it was flat like a chalupa and had guacamole on it. She said the guacamole was pretty tasteless. She couldn't bring herself to eat more than about a third of this item--and again, had no desire to take it home. (4) They offer only two kinds of taco filling--ground beef and chicken. My beef taco was acceptable, but not exciting, and nothing I would ever order again. (5) My chalupa was quite mediocre. I couldn't finish it, and had no desire to take the remainder home. (6) The menu does NOT show prices for drinks, whether soft drinks or beer or margaritas or anything else. You have to ask about every individual drink or brand to learn its cost. (7) Our waiter pretty much disappeared on us. We waited a long time for our check--he finally brought it only after we stood up and put on our coats. (8) The management wouldn't let us use the gift certificate to pay the tip. We've eaten at much classier restaurants using gift certificates--Biaggi's, Big Grove, Silver Creek (as well as at Mas Amigos when it existed)--and they all permitted us to pay the tip (and I like to leave large tips) out of what's left on the gift certificate. But not at this restaurant.  We will never go to El Toro again. Our hypothesis to explain why we've heard good things about this restaurant is that our friends simply don't know what good Mexican food is supposed to taste like (FWIW, I'm from Texas and grew up on the stuff)."}
{"text":"It's great if you want a huge pile of slop for a low price. The food is terrible, but the drinks are cheap and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Below average Mexican restaurant. Food didn't taste good at all. I like Mexican food mostly for its flavor. But, the items we ordered lacked taste and flavor. Also, they need to pay attention to cleanliness. Our table and chairs were not clean."}
{"text":"This is a very spacious restaurant that handles big parties. I think compared to the other el toros this is he best one! They have some dishes that are made up that are really good like the Sarjento and the choripollo. Their Chips and salsa are delicious as well and everyone loves their queso sauce. I will say this so Mexicans don't get the wrong impression.. the food here is delicious but it is not authentic Mexican food! If someone from Mexico or places like Chicago come expecting tacos de carne asada with with cilantro and onions and a spicy sauce, they will be upset to see a ground beef taco with a red sauce. So it is good because it is in Urbana, but once again, it is not authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Another great location in the El Toro family that we have in the area. Food is always excellent as expected, but the real strength is their service. The servers at this location make sure you never run out of something to drink, chips and salsa, or anything else. They're the best. I'll certainly be back to this location. Great food and great service for a great price."}
{"text":"There isn't much to say but THE BEST SERVICE IN TOWN. The workers at this location are the best hands down, they also provide high quality food at a reasonable price. Wonderful experience every time"}
{"text":"terrible customer service. when we walked in they ignored us and did not speak or ask us if we needed to be seated. very rude."}
{"text":"We went here with a couple of friends, amazing food and even better service. I had the pollo empaninzado and a margarita and loved them both! Great place and I plan on returning."}
{"text":"Had another great experience here with a group of 5 and many different dishes were ordered.  Everything delicious but noticed red sauce was hotter than usual.  Loved the warm chips with the freshly made salsa!  Many people wait on you so you are never in need of anything.  I cant wait to go back for a more expensive evening meal."}
{"text":"Consistently good, this is a place that is dependable and predictable, fast, and provides good value. It's not perfect but when you're looking for predictably fast pleasant service it fills the bill.  Martin Fuentes is part of a family that runs several Mexican restaurants in east central Illinois."}
{"text":"We eat here at least once a week. Food is always great, at a great value. They have a huge menu selection and fantastic serve."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch after walking out of Hickory BBQ found this place so much better the food was very very good and the service was excellent. Almost everything on the lunch menu was $5 we had so much food we had to take some home"}
{"text":"One of our favorites. Super fast service. Very reasonable prices. Very friendly staff. Margaritas big enough to swim in. I like the carnitas and ice cream for desert. Go easy on the chips because there's so much more. If you must have chips get the guacamole. Worth the drive. Easy parking."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Staff were really great. Other servers than our own would walk by and ask if we were ok in addition to our server being very attentive to us. I definitely recommend this!"}
{"text":"If you want anything resembling authentic Mexican food with fresh ingredients, go somewhere else.  This is not the place.  The food is hot, and you get good portions, but the sauces taste like they came out of a jar, and the spices taste like prepackaged blends you can buy at any grocery store."}
{"text":"Large helpings of somewhat bland Mexican food.  The staff is friendly, though.  Being vegetarian I am always looking for something BESIDES a combo of bean burrito, cheese enchilada, rice and beans.  This place (and all the other related locations like El Toro and El Toro Bravo) did not give me a whole lot of exciting options.  It all seems to come covered in overly salty red sauce."}
{"text":"Here's the deal--I'm not a fan of everything on the menu.  In fact, I think that the majority of the menu items are not good.  But, if you order carnitas tacos, you won't be disappointed.  Toro Loco is worth a trip, but only for these tacos.  The salsa lacks flavor, and if you ask for anything hotter, a warm, unappetizing bowl of hotter salsa comes out.    Margaritas are 1.99 on Mondays, and beer is reasonably priced too.  The service is always friendly and reliable.  I wouldn't go out of the way to eat here, but seeing as I'm in the neighborhood, I'm glad Toro Loco is in town.  And I hope they never run out of carnitas tacos."}
{"text":"The food quality and service here screams average. The jumbo margaritas are cool but it's mostly filled with ice."}
{"text":"Again another fine meal at El Toro's I had fajita quesadilla with the added extra cheese sauce on the top of it and you can't beat that if you ever walk out of that place hungry it's your own fault a great meal for less than $15 excellent service so a great tip and highest praises to the staff because they treat you like family and I can't think of a better way to be treated in a restaurant than the way they do at El Toro Loco in Urbana."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Urbana.  First tried it a couple of years ago when I was spending most of my time at the hospital with my mother in her last days.  The giant frozen margarita was delicious and just what I needed!  And it comes in several flavors. The enchiladas suizas are my favorite menu item.  The casual atmosphere is great for taking my daughter's family of 4 kids out to eat.  We've never been disappointed in the service or the quality of the food.  It's not gourmet Mexican, but it's tasty and abundant.  Prices are what you'd expect for the food - very reasonable."}
{"text":"Just ate at the loco... Soooo much better the the Champaign location..bravo? On Springfield. Loco,s sauces were very flavorful and rich.. My chips were hot and fresh it all was so good. So good I ate way to much now Timmy needs a nappy nap... Oh shhhh el oasis...yup"}
