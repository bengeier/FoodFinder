{"text":"Celebrated my son and his GF birthdays last night. Excellent service for our waiter Nick. Worth every penny. Thank you for making theirs Birthdays so memorable!!"}
{"text":"After all the hype, I had high expectations. What a colossal disappointment. My friend and I were given a cozy 2-seater banquet seating. That's where the \"nice\" ended.  We ordered a Rioja which was pleasant enough ($90). We then ordered the ribeye to share (14oz) along with brussel sprouts and wild mushroom sides, and the Caesar salad to split and shrimp cocktail. (As an aside, they didn't split the salad into 2 plates).   Several minutes later she came back to clarify what I had said very clearly- we wanted the ribeye, 14 oz to share. She said oh, I was about to order the 21oz with the bone...right... the ribeye.   While we were waiting a couple sat down next to us and immediately the woman pulled out her iPhone and was using the flashlight to read her menu. She continued to keep it on, even when the server came over to answer some questions. The piercing light was insane. We mentioned this to our same server who thought it was funny and yet when we told her it was serious - it was really bothering our eyes she refused to do anything about it. My partner then asked if we could be relocated because this woman still hadn't turned off her flashlight (5 minutes). One might say it's not the restaurant's fault that we had a rude person next to us however they didn't seem to think it was an issue.   Things never got better. The new table they gave us had glaring lights focused down on the table. Somehow our bottle of wine got misplaced and we had to ask for our glasses to be refilled. The steak was okay but the (brown) sprouts and mushrooms we're drowning in greasy oil. It was a plate full of brown, brown, brown.    One final assault in the women's washroom - the stall I was in had no toilet paper. I had to laugh, it made sense.   What was evident to both of us, this place is trying to be fine dining and failing on every level, especially regarding wait staff.   My advice, if you want a great dining experience and delicious steak go to N A O."}
{"text":"We went to STK with another couple.   Left not just disappointed with the experience but also annoyed with the attitude.  I ordered the delmonico and asked for it medium rare.  The steak came out a charred overdone mess.  It happens so I asked to have it redone the way I had ordered it.  The waiter took it back but then came back to the table twice trying to convince me that since the very centre of the steak was medium rare, that that's how it was \"supposed to be\". Basically the attitude was that i was an idiot who didn't know how steak was served!  I expect far better from a restaurant that calls itself STK, and charges $70 for just the steak!  Not at all happy with the attitude.  This place is unnecessarily hyped up, and not worth it at all!  Stay way - you can get much better steak and service without attitude elsewhere."}
{"text":"Yelpers, we came for our friend's bday and while we ordered champagne, oysters, steaks and wine, the service was subpar! Our steak was delivered before we were able to order the red wine that was going to complement our porterhouse so we waited until we ordered and got the wine. By that time the steak was cold...Moreover, when it came to paying the bill and splitting our friend's meal, our waitress screwed it up royally so we had to wait \"one hot second\", which ended up being 30 mins for her to figure out the bill...Come one, STK - you can do better than this!"}
{"text":"The food was not good and the service was even worse. We had reservations and they moved us to a smaller table to accommodate another group. The second table was tiny and we were all sitting so close to one another (not ideal in a STEAK restaurant). They then moved us to a bigger table in the back, and the service went downhill from there. Our table was ignored and it took us 1.5 hours to get our food. So unimpressed. The food was very expensive for what we got ($12 for 10 pieces of fries? Really??)"}
{"text":"I had a dinner date reservation here on a Tuesday night at 6:30PM. The place was practically filled by 8PM which was quite impressive for a weeknight.  The ambiance was quite different from your typical quiet and lit steakhouse. There was music playing loudly and it was pretty popping as the night progressed. I wouldn't recommend this for a date night, but I think it would be perfect for a GNO, especially with the gram worthy marble walls at the entrance.  We ordered: Bread (complimentary) - Not huge on the blue cheese on top, but the dip that came with it was very delicious! Lil' Brgs - Cooked medium rare and very juicy - would recommend  Shaved Brussels Sprout - Very similar to the kale salad in a bag minus the kale from Costco - it was meh Dry-Aged Porterhouse - Had this medium rare and it came with 2 sauces which was a pretty neat. The steak was very simple and I figured that's why the sauce was provided. It wasn't too bad. Mac & Cheese - I was impressed by the portion size as it was suitable to share for 2+ people, but I thought PC's White Cheddar Mac and Cheese tasted better as it wasn't anything special (simple and heavy) Orange Dream Cheesecake - I'm not huge on desserts but this mars bar sized cheesecake deliciously hit the spot and was the perfect way to end the meal  Service: water game was on-point (which is key) and the waitress checked up on us frequently  Overall, with such great steak options around the city I don't think I'd recommend this place to a friend as none of the food stood out."}
{"text":"We went here for my best friends birthday and it was a disaster! Firstly I have to say the place is designed very nicely and the scene is great but the food sucked. We ordered 11 steaks for our group and 6 of them were cooked terribly wrong. How do you order a medium rare and get a well done steak? The general manager was \"fake\" friendly about it. Came over to the table to ask for our feedback but we were still stuck with the majority of the bill at the end. For a new restaurant opening you want the good word to spread but they clearly did not care about that. For $100 per person I would suggest going to a more established and well known steakhouse in Toronto like Jacobs or Barabarian. Again great vibe and all but would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Toronto's most overpriced douche parade. The first time we went, the service was slow and uneven and the food was VERY expensive but, decent enough. We chalked it up to growing pains and made another reservation for last weekend, later at night, to celebrate a birthday. Big mistake, food was worse, service was slower and $300 for 3 sides, an order of (cold) crab and 4 glasses of wine (cheap malbec at $20 a glass that wouldn't cost $15 for a whole bottle) just wasnt worth the bother. There's way better restaurants for less money and you don't have to put up with outrageously loud music, creepy old/nouveau riche people obviously on an AshleyMadison hookup and kids trying to spend their parents home equity loans on $400 haircuts and bottle service. Way to loud, expensive and douchey!"}
{"text":"We went there on a Saturday night. It was predominantly a 35+ crowd, which was fine.  The service was impeccable, from the hostess, to our waitress, to the GM to the bartender, all were very kind, attentive and over all very pleasant. We were a rotating party of four (meaning we only ever had 3 people at the table at any given time) and ordered the following:  steak tartar as a starter it was okay, for the main we had the fish and steak with a side of chimichurri sauce and a side of mushrooms. The steak was fantastic as was the fish. The mushrooms were a great side for the steak. For dessert we had some toffee cake I think? it was DELICIOUS! Get the cake!"}
{"text":"Had a fun time tonight. The vibes are lit here! Our food was ok but the mood and atmosphere made up for it. It is expensive here so plan to spend money. The bathrooms are not up to par. Best music!!"}
{"text":"Not worth the wait times, the effort, or the money. The $73 14oz bone in steak was 10 oz of bone and 4 oz of meat. The \"wild mushrooms\" on the menu are not wild, they are run of the mill portobelos. They will try and upsell you everything from fancy water to truffle fries which are lifeless and not crispy. We were upsold on a $335 bottle of wine that was uneventful and not worth the price tag. Our bill was $773 for two people and we left hungry and disappointed. Too much hype and no delivery."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the new STK in Toronto, although I have never been to another STK restaurant. As I walked in I felt that it was quite confusing. There was a table standing there and you start to question where to go and if you should wait. Behind me were two guys that confidently walked upstairs, also questioning whether or not they should wait for someone. After following them upstairs I was pleasantly greeted by a host and hostess that were more than happy to get me situated. I came right on time for my reservation (7:30) and was seated right away. The music was louder than I would've wanted it, considering it was difficult to hear the people I was having dinner with. The service was great, very helpful and attentive. I find at steak restaurants the big standouts and what I always look at first are the sides. I tried the asparagus, Mac n' cheese, and the tater tot shredded pork poutine. All very delicious and I would highly recommend. Steak was delicious, cooked to perfection and the donuts for dessert were very yummy. I also had a wonderful cocktail- strawberry cobbler. I definitely recommend this place for a fun night out with your friends or family, but not if you need to have a serious conversation."}
{"text":"Quite simply the worst high end steakhouse I've been to in Toronto. Service was good, but it's so loud that they have trouble hearing.   Food is atrocious. Meat isn't even USDA for the price. Had to send all four entrees our table ordered back.   Don't waste your time or money to eat here. Better to just come to the bar for a drink.   Food - 1/5 Service - 3/5 Ambiance - 3/5 Food to Value Ratio - 1/5  Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time last night celebrating my wife's birthday!! Great atmosphere and excellent service!! Missed a star because their sides need a little work.  Upbeat atmosphere and great food=a great night out!!"}
{"text":"So so so disappointing. STK in meatpacking is one of my all time fav spots. This place should not be allowed to be called STK. The food is flat out bad. The management was rude when I noted that my steak was medium well, and not medium rare, and tried to tell me it was grey because it had been sitting on the table \"for a while\" - which was less than 20 minutes. 3 of us had already spent $650 on booze alone. You think I'm trying to scam my way into a free $60 steak? Why she did not just admit it apologize and get me another one, I have no clue. I probably wouldn't have gone back anyway, because aside from how the steak was cooked, the food was legitimately bad. Uninspired side dishes. Tater tot Poutine was made by an 11 year old with wide eyes.  THE KEG TASTES BETTER. GO THERE FOR DINNER AND STOP BY STK AFTER FOR A DRINK."}
{"text":"Oh boy. Cannot call this a steakhouse. Ive been to all the best in the city a few times and here twice and the food is so bad .Of course, many of my friends love the scene, i must change my group of friends; working on that.   Good atmosphere and drink only.  Extra star for the staff who were pleasant.  Not worth the price of food. Seriously food at any of the joeys, earls, cactus club even the freaking new york steak and fries at jack astors is better then this. You cannot even compare the food to any of the top tier steakhouses in the city. Just dont...  We had the sea bass, steak filet; i asked medium rare came out medium well. Two different shrimp appies the raw cocktail shrimp had a gross heavy dill taste to it. Cesar salad meh. The parmesan fries were so so so so soooo bad . no seriously wow. I was embarrassed for the waiter .  The wine and drinks were good , that is all.    Please fix the quality of your food please please pleaaase . pretty please? And  the restaurant would be a solid 4 stars. We know it wants to be ."}
{"text":"If you like being ripped off,  then by all means visit STK. Paying outrageous prices for seriously small portions seems to be the mantra of the menu. Whilst service and ambience were great, the food is not worth the squeeze. Want steak that's worth the price tag? Go to Jacob's or maybe the team from STK should go to Jacob's and see what an adequate portion entails. To all Toronto foodies out there, say no to pretentious dining!"}
{"text":"The beautiful ambiance of STK will really set you in the mood for a wonderful dining experience.  You should be prepared to open your wallet but I think it is worth while.  As a party of 4 we had the luxury of sampling many menu items.  We sampled two different Salads:  Baby Gem Lettuce Caesar herb croutons - Parmesan Reggiano was beautifully plated drenched in micro thin shavings of Parmesan Reggiano. The salad was not at all heavy on the garlic, so if you are a garlic fan you may find this salad underwhelming. We also sampled the Shaved Brussels Sprouts salad with apples - cranberries - goat's gouda - marcona almonds, I felt that this was the salad to have, light and delicious.   The steaks were cooked to perfection, we ordered Filet 10 oz and the  Sirloin16 oz medium rare.  STK delivered 4 perfectly cooked steaks that were melt in your mouth tender. We ordered 3 sides, the Foraged Wild Mushrooms, the table favorite, Asparagus which were lovely with the steak. We also ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries, the presentation was beautiful but I found the fries dense and dry with no hint of truffle but plenty of parmesan, don't feel bad to skip them.  Desert was hit and miss. Don't miss out on the Bittersweet Chocolate Cake, totally dreamy. The Warm Baked Cookie was nothing to write home about.  Serving staff is outstanding, very pleasant and friendly. STK is well worth the visit, reservations are probably a good idea."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and vibe- luxurious and lively with great music.   Very expensive mediocre food. I got the lobster, not knowing what the price was since it didnt have a price for it on the menu probably because it varies based on the size of lobster, it came out to $140. It was not buttered or had any flavor. There was butter available on the side but my mother makes better lobster. For the price, it was not worth it. All of the mains do not come with sides, each side you add is an additional $15+ depending on what you get.  The best food I ate there was the complimentary bread.   The service was average to below average. The waitress didnt seem to notice that there was not enough cutlery for the number of people at the table. The waitress was somewhat rude after we had dessert. She was very eager to try to get us to leave and continually asked if we were done and wanted our bills. A different waiter came and grabbed our plates from us without asking if we were done with our desserts yet (which I wasn't).    I would come back for the atmosphere and to have a drink or two, but I would definitely not come here if your intention is to have exceptional food. The keg has better food at a less expensive price."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night, it wasn't too busy and it was also a last minute idea so we had no reservations and I was wearing black sweat pants. It's located in Yorkville and the esthetics of the place was really beautiful, even when you walk in you see a marble panel with the restaurant name on it. It was a very classy looking place. Although I looked out of place the workers were very polite and professional. My date and I ordered a 6 oz($39.99) and 10 oz($59.99) filet mignon, crispy shrimp appetizer ($22), 3 mushroom side($13?), a strong bow cider drink and a glass of red wine.   The first thing to come out was the bread baked in a cute little cast iron skillet with a fresh tasting green dip that I really enjoyed. I could've ate all the bread but then would not have room for my main meal. Next came the crispy shrimp in a delicious orangy sauce, tasted like a Cajun creamy sauce and it was also very tasty.  My steak was okay, it was a little more cooked than I would've liked (ordered medium rare) I also got truffle butter and chimichurri sauce and enjoyed them both, but be warned the chimichurri sauce leaves a garlicky smell. I enjoyed the 3 mushroom side and was too full to order dessert.  I would come back again if I had good company and wanted to enjoy something a little more fancy."}
{"text":"Watch out for getting overcharged for 5 bottles of water you never ordered. On numerous occasions, STK servers knowingly charge you for bottles of water you never ordered. They always say, \"you had 5 bottles\" which is an absolute lie. I don't know if the management tells them to overcharge their customers.  It's very disappointing. With that said, my family and friends will never go to STK again. They will continue to lose their regular customers if they do not fix this issue."}
{"text":"First off I want to say that was the best service I've ever had in my life... thank you benyamin (I hope I spelled his name right). We went for my friends bday... we didn't make any reservations, WHICH I recommend you do, otherwise no table. When we came in the front door girls weren't very pleasant.******We sat down by the bar hoping we were going to get a table. Our server came and he went above and beyond, he knew we wanted to eat so he put us in a place where we were able to eat comfortably. We were able to enjoy our meal have a great time with the amazing music in the background... and in the end when it came to celebrating my friends bday.... benyamin and the other servers made sure it was an unforgettable  moment... with them dancing with the flares and big smiles on their faces... they lightened up the room! We forgot all about not having a proper table... I would come back just for the service! Amazing job STK! Good choices on your servers!"}
{"text":"Such a terrible place very road service! It was four of us and we paid 1500$ for 3 bottles of champagne, the server even didn't open our third bottle of champagne and told us they can't serve after 1pm! Such thieves !!!!! Not even worth trying!"}
{"text":"So my review is quite biased as my friend wanted to come here to celebrate her birthday (drinks and dance). So not going to comment on the food...or steak! But the restaurant in general...well, let's put it this way.   As is the trend, or not, STK is one of those restaurants that becomes a bouncer-protecting club in the evenings. Not sure if this only happens on the weekend, but my friend tried to get on the waiting list to get in and only at AROUND 10 did they say there was a spot available. We went up these winding stairs to basically a club, with tables pushed to the side for remaining diners. I don't think anyone comes here this late to eat.  I ordered a bottle of Veuve to celebrate the bday girl and had to wait an eternity. We just sat at the table waiting for service, which none came. Of course, as soon as we all left, than a confused waitress came...looking for a table that ordered champagne.   The scene is very sleazy-clubby...you know...old men with old women (or not) and hands rubbing legs and other areas. We tried to dance to loud thumping music, but really wasn't feeling the groove. Because the area still had operations of a restaurant, it was hard trying to dance amidst other dancers, tables, waiters carrying drinks, steaks, fries, etc...Goodness forbid one gets too into the groove and bumps into a waiter...sending a (hopefully) perfectly cooked steak onto someone's lap.  Would I come back here for the party? Nope. Would I come here for dinner? Probably not.... STK is too \"Vegas-y\" for me, but if that's your kind of scene, then def try it out!"}
{"text":"Amazing service! Susie was amazing! Good was incredible, great experience, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Brutal service. We've been waiting at our table for 50 mins and no one has come over to take our order. Super pretentious and overrated."}
{"text":"I won't be coming here again any time soon. I'll probably give it another try in 6 months. Two months is more than enough time for a restaurant to get its act together but obviously not the case with STK. service was TERRIBLE.   I had reserved a table for two 4 weeks in advance for a Friday night. The reservation was for 10:15 PM. We did not get seated until 10:50. What's the point in the reservation then? I can understand a 5 maybe 10 minute wait but 35 minutes? During that time I had asked someone if she could tell me an approximate wait time. She told me she couldn't because she's shadowing the hostess. If you're shadowing the hostess then you should have an idea based on how the night has been going ... she ended up giving us a complimentary drink card each.  When I was seating I was asked for my drink order. That was received quickly. It took another 40 minutes until I had been ASKED what I wanted to eat. It seemed as if the server had been avoiding my eye contact.  Regardless of if it's her fault or not, inform us what is going on and seem apologetic. Because I was getting no service from her and I didn't know what was going on I asked for a manager. He came by and was understanding. He decided to put our appetizer on the house.  The food came 30 minutes after we ordered it.  When we were ready for the bill we had let our server know. She came back 20 mins later without the bill and asked if we were finished our food. We had to remind her of the bill again.  My reservation was at 10:15 and i left the restaurant at 12:45. That's ridiculous. After two months of being open there is no excuse.  That being said, the food is delicious. 5/5. But I think they could have added some vegetables to the steak or something.."}
{"text":"Salty Overpriced Mediocrity  Pardon me if this review sounds salty, but I am still trying to get the taste of salt out of my mouth.   The decor and ambiance are more reminiscent of a cougar filled nightclub than a restaurant. If you like loud Trap remixes of 80's classics, this is your place. If you have any tastebuds (music or tongue) this isn't.  A place for talking at (not with) people whilst drinking *&!#@$%! priced drinks.   The service is embarrassingly fawning. There was an error with our meal (one dish not ordered, and was rush ordered once they realized, which was when the rest of the party received theirs). The server (and FOH Manager?) removed the dish from the bill, provided a free side dish, and provided a free dessert. Overkill, but perhaps the regular clientele expects this kind of service. If so I feel sorry for, well... everyone involved.  The Steak was a chewy salty mess. The sides were the best food of the night, (apart from the parmesan fries, which were FAR TOO SALTY (see a theme) and soft). I especially liked the Brussels Sprouts.   Do you have more money than taste? Then do yourself a favour and go somewhere else regardless.   Do I recommend this place?  no"}
{"text":"Drinks were amazing, waitress was extremely helpful in deciding what to order, atmosphere is great but a bit loud. They say the food portions aren't too big but they were huge so more bang for your buck. Good for a date or casual meeting of friends, would never recommend for a business meeting."}
{"text":"Was seated 30 minutes after reservation.  Restaurant smells like kitchen smoke...bad ventelation.  Slow service  Have had better food at other STK locations."}
{"text":"This is an overrated Steakhouse. We fell the the decor and ambiance. The vibe, service and wine was good, but it couldn't make up for the disappointing steaks. This not a Steakhouse, it's more like a lounge. Come for drinks and social not the food.  My hubby and I came for a date night after a friend recommended this restaurant. We were really excited and impressed until we got our food. The salad was good, but not special. We got a skirt steak and Delmonico steak. My steak was bitter because it was charred. My husband's steak was overcooked and lacked flavour. The side mushroom was too oily, but ok. Overall, we left disappointed and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Just had a birthday event here tonight and it was definitely a good time. Our party came late and they were very accommodating. We ordered WagYu beef burger sliders to start and it was definitely the highlight of the meal. The burger was tender and juicy.   I ordered the 14oz dry aged steak and it was so good. Although it was slightly over medium rare, I still like my steak more cooked. However the filet mignon ordered by my friends were cooked perfectly medium rare.   For sides we ordered the truffle fries. They were very truffle-y.  For dessert, the sticky toffee pudding and the mini donuts were amazing. A really good ending to the night.   Overall, the food was good but hard to command the premium. However if you like to eat and lounge but you don't want to get up and dance then this spot will definitely satisfy your night. The service was really good. Our waitress was nice and did a good job of explaining every meal.   My only issue was that the subwoofer was right under our booth seats and shook my bottom so much I felt like the food I was trying to enjoy had already met its last stop in my body."}
{"text":"One of the tastiest octupus  is served here....Super friendly staff ...Very efficent service.Had one of the best dates of my life here."}
{"text":"Pretentious and snooty and the service was lacking.  The old fashion was ok but had to wait a while before being helped. Busy place which is cool but filled with not my kind of vibe. Tried the slider and it was very good wouldn't mind trying other food here.  Very nice ambiance and presentation of food."}
{"text":"Hosted a large dinner event for a bachelor party. Communication was fantastic throughout the process. The only complaint was the provided menus to choose from (pre fixed with groups over 15) were quite poor and only included one main beef choice for the most part. I ended up adding a second beef cut for a fee per person, regardless of if they actually ordered the second option. The sides were fantastic. Great service. Good ambiance, however, we were seated at the high tops for a large party (19) and it was a bit difficult to converse- as expected. Pricing was high but we had a great experience and all left completely stuffed. You get what you pay for and this meal was fantastic. Table was ready within 5 minutes which I appreciated on a busy Saturday night. Would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"I hosted a group of about 12 people at STK Toronto. We came in after 10:30 on a Saturday. I wouldn't consider it very busy. They had space to seat 12 immediately. We waited for 25 minutes before anyone approached the table. I had to go ask for a server. We ordered 3 bottles of red, and 1 white. Just there for drinks. The wine took another 15 minutes at least. I notice the waiter who'd helped us.... at the bar doing shots with other patrons.... I start to understand why things are moving so slowly. The wine comes after the group has been sitting with no service for 45+ minutes. Good wine. No server or manager comes back to the table to check on us. After pouring a second glass for the entire table MYSELF I approached the manger I'd spoke with previously about the original poor service. \"hey man, don't you think after the last conversation we'd had it might be a good idea to ensure I don't have to pour for the whole table?\"  The conversation deteriorates when I insist someone apologize to our table. Reluctantly  he asks me..... \"What would you like me to say, sir\"......  ---- I'd like you to go acknowledge my (your) guests who have spent well over $1000 on wine that the experience we had was unacceptable  and  apologize. JUST APOLOGIZE.... was like pulling teeth.  This \"manager\" was so rude and reluctant to right an obvious wrong, that admittedly, I just blew up at  him. He was making comments under his breath... I'd had enough. He embarrassed me, he embarrassed STK, and he got an earful that he deserved.   Terrible leadership, terrible service.....  Love the STK in Chicago and LAs Vegas.... Foods great... wine excellent.... this staff in Toronto is a joke. Absolute joke. For the record, I tipped 20% (for the service we SHOULD have gotten)."}
{"text":"The music here is loud. The place is fun.  Service was pretty good. However, take your wallet to the washroom because this is one of the few restaurants in Toronto with a bathroom attendant.  The food was pretty good but not great. We ordered the octopus and tuna as appetizers. They were ok.  For dinner I had the 20z ribeye. This was quite good. We ordered tatter tots, spinach and asparagus as sides.  The donuts for dessert are excellent.  They do not have an extensive steak menu."}
{"text":"came for a birthday party!great environment! food was perfect staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"I've been to the stk in miami and Vegas, toronto just can't get it right. First off, the food was terrible both times I have been there for dinner, from mediocre steak to still frozen shrimp to burnt mac and cheese it was back to back disappointments. This reflects on a poorly managed and operated restaurant. Also the manager Michelle was overly flirtatious with the men at the table which made the women uncomfortable, this is supposed to be a high end steak house, act accordingly! I would say this is more of a place you go to have drinks, then again the vibe in there is cheesy. Overall disappointment, stay away. Much better places to dine in toronto where the food is good and you are respected."}
{"text":"This place is very mediocre in terms of actual quality. It has been hyped up to seem way better than it actually is .   One thing I love about here, MUSIC is pretty great . So it does liven u up with the very lively atmosphere dancing and singing to the ongoing popular hits everyone loves.  Did notice though, this place is filled with cougars trying to get picked up by older men. Lol   We made dinner reservations for 10:15 pm for my friends birthday.  We got there on time , they wouldnt seat us because they didnt have a table for us because the people before us were taking longer..  they had us wait 50 minutes.. FIFTY MINUTES, to sit at our RESERVED table. & after i lost my shit , the manager decided to come and offer some complimentary champagne. Alright.    The food? VERY pricey for very mediocre. I ordered the sirloin, pretty big cut. Tasted pretty good , Not bad , not amazing.  As i was ordering our waitress had asked \"& what side do u want?\"  Im like what does it come with? (Because normally steak comes with a side of potatos or veggies or salad)  She shows me the options.  Im like sure, whatever, brussel sprouts.  Tell me how they charge 15-20 bucks extra for these sides.. I dont like the sneaky ness. I was very unimpressed .   Would i return? Perhaps for a drop in drink and dancing sure .  For an actual sit in dinner or event? Absolutely not. Very unorganized & overpriced."}
{"text":"I was brought here by a friend for after dinner drinks. I had never heard of the place, and it was rammed. It's a bit weird because it's part restaurant, part lounge, part bar, all in the same, small space. With a DJ playing music so loud it was impossible to have a conversation. I would have hated eating food here. The drinks are overpriced but average by Toronto standards, and the bar clientele sketchy at best. It is not a place I'd willingly return to, mostly because of the lame, wannabe drinks crowd. I can't comment on the food or table service."}
{"text":"Meat market! I'm sorry to say that but it's Tuesday night!!!! Food is ok and service is ok too but not atmosphere...we had some drinks before meals...food is what I look for nothing else. Steaks alright but nothing to write home about. I liked the service which is completely separate from the food.so bottom line, I'd go here for drinks but not for food...especially after trying the porter house."}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The porter house,while not the best I've had, was good as was the tuna tartare. Overall, a great experience."}
{"text":"Friday night was my second time at STK. It continues to be an absolute mad house and busy -- even with a 10:15pm reservation. We arrived 5 minutes earlier than our reservation however, our table wasn't quite ready and we were asked to wait at the bar and told to grab a drink. Unfortunately that area is dominated by every individual just wanting to be in the restaurant that we couldn't actually order a drink and chose to \"patiently\" wait nearby.   We were eventually seated shortly after our expected reservation time and everything progressed pretty quickly and smoothly. We had ordered one of the cocktails that tasted fantastic initially but when we ordered a second one, it wasn't quite the same and was brought back and returned not much better.   For entrees because of the hour we went with seafood -- a bit lighter than a heavy steak. We had the sea bass and tuna and they were both great. But the star of the meal was definitely those little mini burgers on their appetizer menu. Deeeelllish!"}
{"text":"Pros: One of the best steaks I have ever had, vibrant room, excellent service.   Cons: Room is way too loud, appetizers are pricy and for the most part tasteless."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere but overpriced steak for such a small portion. But that's Yorkville for ya!  Note that the steak does not come with any sides, that means you have to order sides which cost $$$$. But sides are shareable so you're welcome to split it with someone."}
{"text":"I've been here twice on a Friday & once on a Saturday, & in terms of the day with the best vibe I'd say both days were pretty similar. I usually have super late reservations and never had to wait for my table. Honestly don't get the negative reviews on here because we've had top notch service all the times we've been.   Food wise - steak is yummy (had the 10 oz strip loin) but sides are quite on the small portion side & super pricey. The complimentary bread they give is yum and enough to fill you up along with your steak ( no need for sides in my opinion, as I couldn't even finish my steak ) but this may be because I'm always in tight outfits and don't have the luxury to eat that much. The drinks are super pricey here ( $18 for bar rail and $16 for martini lol) so get your credit card prepared if it's a place you plan to get drunk :) Music is loud and fun and the DJ manages to get the crowd on their feet after past 12 but this may be as a result of the free liquor that is given (don't get excited though, this may just be on weekends) but still - I like that they want the crowd TURNT LOL  My only concern with this place was when I went last night. The female Washroom was NASTY! Not sure what was going on - but for such an establishment, I don't expect to be uncomfortable while powdering my nose in a dirty space. P.S maybe they can change the lighting in the washroom? It sucks for selfies and group pictures LOL. STK please take a cue from Dbar - they probably have the best lighting in the city.  All in all, if you are looking for a fun night out with good music and food, this is the place for you. Thanks STK - I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I haven't been to many steakhouses but STK was amazing! Even though it was on the pricey side, It had a great atmosphere (very lively) and the service was phenomenal. The fresh bread they brought at the beginning was phenomenal. To drink, I had the cucumber stiletto cocktail which was very refreshing and light. For the main meal, I ordered the loin strip (cooked medium to medium well) and the creamy mashed potatoes. Steak was super tender and the mashed potatoes was a perfect accompaniment. For my birthday they also brought me a piece of flourless chocolate cake which was the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. Highly recommended!  Definitely would come back 10/10"}
{"text":"This was a HUGE upset for me. Being an avid supporter of most STK establishments I visit on a worldwide basis the service at this particular location was definitely less than par. It started off a little rocky from the beginning as it was NYE and we had a reservation but waited 30 mins to be seated, after asking numerous times when our table would be ready we were sat at the same table that had been empty for the past 30 mins. (Baffled) then or server was overwhelmed, scarce and we had to keep asking other servers for things as they passed by. Drinks were on a 30 min delay and when inquiring about them we were told \"I don't know what to tell you\" after all of this we wined down the night with a round of shots. Only to be sent 4 rounds. When asked who ordered all these we were told \"don't worry we got this by the waiter\" upon exiting we were told to go back and close our tab that we never opened as there wasn't even a cc on file as we had already closed out. Long story short we were stuck with a bill for shots we did NOT order ($250 bill to be exact). Not allowed to leave and not allowed to see a mgr we paid the bill and left. Completely unacceptable and guarantee will never visit this location again."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are visiting from Orlando Fl and we have been debating rather or not to come and dine at STK since we have one back home. And boy were we presently surprise!  The staff and the ambiance where exceptional, especially our bar tender Endea and the manager Erick.   This is way more than an a restaurant it's a place to cut loose and enjoy the night.  We highly recommend STK.   It exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"A fantastic experience from start to finish! The evening began with a warm welcome at the door along with our coats being politely whisked away to the coat check. After being seated our server, Jordan, suggested a few drinks to start with and on that note we were off on a fun filled evening of great spirits, food, and service! Our cocktails were delicious and just as described. We opted for a side dish as an appetizer: The Tater Tot Short Rib Poutine was out of this world good! Followed shortly by two amazing steaks and then desert doughnuts to die for! Throughout the evening Jordan was attentive but not intrusive. He knew just when to step in and fill a glass of wine, or when to stay away and let us fend for ourselves. Not an easy skill to master but Jordan sure has. Jordan did not fly solo in our great service experience. He just fronted a wonderful team of servers/bus staff that took care of our every need."}
{"text":"It's about time this place opens up in Toronto! I've been to the locations in Miami and NYC.   It's the spot to see and be seen. Also, their steaks are top notch- hopefully they keep up their food & service quality."}
{"text":"A very quaint and cozy STK. A diverse and international crowd with good music and food to match. A welcome addition to the family."}
{"text":"Came in kind of late (11:15pm) but was not expecting bad service. For a world class establishment like STK I expected so much better. Had to order drinks by twos because no one came and checked on my party for over 20 min. We were literally waving for someone to serve us and everyone looked away LOL!! No manager came by to ask if anyone was ok. By the time we were ordering food it was 11:55pm and the kitchen closed at 12. I really wanted to like this place, really did. I totally get this is the scene place right now, but DAMN I frequent the Beverly Hills STK and have NEVER experienced anything like this. Catch up Toronto!  Food was amazing as always and the drinks were on point. This is the only reason they get stars."}
{"text":"An hip hop and posh ambience on an early Saturday evening!  The menu is quite simple as far as steaks are concerned: small, medium and large... pick your sauce, your toppings and sides.    The busboy brought over a nicely baked brioche in green onions with pesto sauce and it was wonderful!    Twenty minutes later, my filet medallions arrived ad they were spot on with a medium rare filet mignon.  The side order mushrooms were a bit disappointing as the taste was just driven by the sweetness of onion.  All in all, great place for steaks and catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a spectacular dining experience at STK.  Our server, Gareth, was friendly but not overly so.  Paul, recommended the perfect wine and the manager Eric ensured that my food allergies were taken care of.  We will be back... you must try this restaurant!  Thank you everyone who make the evening perfect."}
{"text":"I wasn't too excited to go this place because of the negative reviews but I'm really happy I did.  Service was stellar Food was amazing  We were a big group and everybody felt they got their money's worth.  I shared the Parmesan fries and the delectable poutine  With an aged delmonico steak  The steak was cooked perfectly and the flavor was very nice.  My friends had the lamb, braised beef and cod.  I tasted everything and it was all very good.  We went on a Sunday night and the bottle of wine were half off! Yay! So we got to experience a nice bottle at little cost.  P.S: their complimentary bread if off the chain"}
{"text":"It is a really nice bar...friendly waitress Really good drinks.. But the steak was just ok.. I don't consider it as a steakhouse.."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming to stk... the food is really good, you have to have their steak with the asparagus. Drinks are great too, I got into the mule drinks because if their stk special.. the ambiance is also great but their usually a full house so I reccomend reservations to avoid waiting around."}
{"text":"Having experienced STK at the Cosmo in Vegas, we were excited to try the new Toronto location.  The space is stylish, to quote a review I read \"Miami meets Manhattan\", and the music level was much better than the cacophonous Cosmopolitan location.  White couches surrounded the bar splitting the two main dining areas.  The wine by the glass selection is not strong, and the bartender admitted as much, so there is an immediate easy win for the upstart.  Brussels sprout salad was excellent, and the lump crab salad has potential, if the melon was riper.  Both my filet and my wife's scallops were undercooked.  The filet was to be medium, and arrived with cool purple center.  I didn't send it back, but thought a steakhouse would get it right.  It was dry aged, and was obviously a quality piece of meat. The sides were decadent and delicious.  Didn't try it, but they had a tater tot, beef short rib poutine that deserve a try if we go back.  For $350 for the two of us, I guess I was hoping for more.  There is a tipping point in the style over substance debate.  If you want to spend that much for steakhouse, try the Morton's across the streak, or take a 15 minute cab ride further downtown for Jacobs & Co. or Harbour 60."}
{"text":"We went to the bar for a drink.Waited 10  minutes for service.No one came.I asked a server if I could order a drink he said someone will be with me and waited a further 5 minutes for someone.None came,so I asked another server for a drink.No one came so we walked out and went to Morton's where they have great service.Suggest you bring your own beverages to the bar if you want a drink!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning!! Terrible. I booked STK for taking a friend there. Been to one in New York was very good. This place since we arrived they didn't have a clue of what's going on. Not even buzy they have us a cramp 2 people both where next booth and chair there were 4 people. Couldn't even get in to our table easily. It took us 45 mins to order and get food. A waitress ( Sabrina ) replied when I just wanted to order an appetizer that they only take complete meal order at once. I order Beef Tartare and Foie Gras with a steak to follow. Spinach and Truffle fries. Something was off in one of the dishes. I kept vomiting and had severe stomach cramps since last night till now. My friend is feeling the same way. I will never recommend anyone to go there ever."}
{"text":"Arrived for the first time ever January 28, 2018 for my sisters 25th  birthday, @10:20 pm reservation was for 10:45pm I waited with guests at  the bar (which was really busy!)  purchased a few  drinks ,had to wait until 11:30pm for my sis'  birthday table. I must say once the tables orders were placed all 12 people were served by 12:25pm.  The wait was hard!!! All guests reported to liked meals, except 1 who's  steak was fixed and delivered late., but corrected to enjoyment.  Atmosphere is great , music is enjoyable, lighting and decor is fresh and elegant. But make sure to come with DOLLARS $$$$$$$$$$. I bought a small glass of wine and two rum and cokes at the bar for $51......I must say this lounge was enjoyable but..... I was upset that everyone had to pay $5.00 automatically called \"cake cutting\" especially if  my sister provided the cake , they didn't let us cut it at the able!...oh they also charge everyone automatic gratuity... lol! .... Service is ok. Wait time was disappointing. Food taste was enjoyable.  Recommend dishes, sides and appetizer according to guests at table are:,  House made Tater totes poutine (side)  Organic chicken Breast (entree) Mushrooms (side) Mac and cheese (appetizer) Fried Shrimp (appetizer) Tuna tartare (entree)  steaks  Small Garlic bread loafs (complementary to table) is just ok , provided the table with 2 for  12 people"}
{"text":"It was terrible. Way too loud. My bread and shrimp was OVERLY salty and undercooked. My steak was burnt and over cooked. Drinks are overpriced and service was slow."}
{"text":"What a treat STK was! Matt, the manager and his staff were super friendly and accommodating. We changed our reservation last minute and still got a great table, superb service and a deliciously sinful dinner!   Since we were earlier than expected, we weren't too hungry. As a result, sharing an appetizer, main and side was the game plan. We were happy we did, because the portions were very healthy.  To kick off the evening we started with the seared and fois gras and rhubarb, which was wonderfully balanced. We decided to go for the Wagu steak which was grilled perfectly. The Foraged Wild Mushrooms and Tater Tot Poutine elevated the meal even further with a warm richness.  We ended the evening with the Sticky Toffee Pudding, a guilty pleasure.   The vibe and the ambiance made it a fun evening, one that needs to be repeated!"}
{"text":"Limited vegan and gf options. Meat lovers enjoyed their steak and sides. Nice decor, friendly staff and DJ keeping it lively."}
{"text":"After seeing reviews, I had low expectations but was pleasantly surprised. The food was really good. The complimentary bread was the bomb, would paid for another order of it. We had the tuna tartare and it was super tasty and tuna was very fresh. We also had the skirt steak and sirloin for our mains and they were both cooked perfectly. We shared the crispy cauliflower and truffle fries, both were good but a bit small at the price point. Overall, great food and service in a modern atomosphere. Not our new favourite steakhouse (we still prefer Jacob's at the higher price point) but enjoyed our experience!"}
{"text":"Good food! Good music! Good service!   There was a man right at the entrance wearing a blue dress shirt looking down on his phone. He then looked and us as I said \"for 2 people.\" and he just stared at us. Still holding the phone he asks, \"you looking for the dining area? 2nd floor.\" As we walk upstairs we think, \"maybe he doesn't work here.. just waiting for someone?\" But no he does work there... Very odd first impression.   Will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Dry-Aged Delmonico. The steak was grilled to a succulent medium rare finish and it was fantastic. I like my Steaks simple so I can really taste the flavor of the meat itself....and this was simple and seasoned lightly and for that reason the flavor of the beef really stood out. I am impressed with the floor plan and decor. The vibe here has hints of Miami and has this lounge ambiance to it...which is a nice change in Yorkville. Most of the restaurants in Yorkville could use a good face lift and step it up a notch because STK nailed it in that department.  I ordered a strawberry cocktail which I found to be extremely sweet so I returned it. I ordered a different cocktail and again it was way to sweet but i didnt want to be a pain in the ass so I didnt return it ( for that reason they got 4 stars and not 5)  I ordered a few rounds of 1942 tequila shots - always a good choice especially if you get them here...the shots here are massive!    Favorites: Dry-Aged Delmonico Stk Tuna Tartare Crispy Rock Shrimp Mac & Cheese Truffle Fries Asparagus  Honestly I had a great time here, great food, great service, and everything is priced right!"}
{"text":"Without a shadow of a doubt the best steakhouse in Toronto and I've eaten in most of them.Arrived last night with a party of 12 and we were treated like Royalty from start to finish.Our waitress Maria is a gem.Service was exceptional.And then the food ..We all tried different appetizers and the flavours were incredible.So tasty..My favourite was the blue cheese ice berg with applewood smoked bacon..delish..(Wagyu sliders close second..)Then the mains..OMG..We tried most of the steaks to share.All cooked to perfection and we had a lot of different doneness at our table but each one was cooked to perfection.The steaks are to die for..The 10 oz Fillet is incredible..melts in your mouth with so much flavour...and the Brussels Sprouts ,you just have to try..Good call Maria...everything flowed just perfectly...which leads us to dessert..Now I definitely don't have a sweet tooth but all I can say is if you go to STK you must not leave without ordering the Sticky Toffee Pudding.It was the best dessert I have ever had in my life and I'm nearly 60..lol..Not sure who or how it was made but the person who made it is a Genius..Its incredible...Thank you for changing my mind on dessert STK..We finished our meal at 11 and the atmosphere in STK was electric..Such a fun place to enjoy a birthday party. Thank You STK and we will all be back very soon!"}
{"text":"I was planning to have another girls night out at this location which took place last night. As you can see from my prior review, I had a fabulous time when I came here a month ago so it was a no brainer to choose this location again.  As you can see from the photo I attached, Erin McHattie (Toronto Marketing Manager) left a comment on my last review to email her when I'd be coming back. So, I proceeded to send her an email and notify her of upcoming reservation.  So, it was four of my girls friend and I. They had never been to STK and were excited to experience it first hand.   Our reservation was for 10pm, we arrived at 10:10. Kind of surprised the table wasn't ready yet. I mean, you emailed me to notify you when I was coming, you think the least they could do is have the table ready???   I should mention that I had an experience like this in the past where a manager commented on my review and when I showed up they had my table ready for me and that establishment is and was busier than STK that night.  So we proceeded to our table 20 minutes later... Our waitress (Maria N) seemed to be in quite a bad mood. I noticed her looking at my friends strangely.. I couldn't figure it out but I decided to ignore it.  We informed her right away that we were ordering food but wanted to order a few drinks before we looked at the menu. Within twenty minutes all my friends ordered drinks. To give you an example, I ordered 2 cranberry orange with a double shot of grey goose with a side strawberry vodka shot. My order alone was at least $60 at that point.  So let's get to the best part of this review. So about twenty minutes in from being seated a male employee came up to our table and informed us that if we didn't order off the menu we wouldn't be able to sit there and that we'd have to leave immediately.  Are you flippin kidding me?!?!! I asked him first who he was? Then, I asked him what would give him the impression that we aren't ordering?!?! He proceeded to say that he was the manager and that our server didn't think we were ordering?!!  Omg what the hell kind of people do you have working here??! I told him WE ARE ORDERING!! Then he said okay, and left. When she came back I asked her, what would give you the impression that we aren't ordering??? We told you we were going to eat? I mean, why would we have reserved a table if we weren't going to eat???  At this point I'm disgusted but I decide to not let it ruin my evening. I ordered the Brussels sprout in maple bacon jam and some sort of disgusting salad that I can't recall the name of now.  I have to say, for such a nice restaurant/atmosphere,  I can't hardly find anything on your menu to eat??. Why is the food so bad?? I just don't get it?!?  My poor friends, they were so excited to come here but that situation left a bad taste in their mouth never mind the fact that it was ABSOLUTELY EMBARASSING!!!!!  Is this why you wanted me to email you?? I'm confused?!? What was the point of you telling me to email you???? What kind of customer relations is this?? What a joke!!  Towards the end of our night, say about 12 am people started dancing on the platform area that attaches between the booths.  Isn't it a no brainer that this is a safety hazard? One girl fell because she was obviously over the limit and when a man went to help her get up she smacked him in the head. The poor guy had an ice pack on his head for the remainder of his night.  You need to look into this or one of these days your going to have a law suit on your hand. Needless to say I won't be back. Never have I ever, been told to leave my table. I totally get why you have so much negative feedback because I experienced it first hand that night.  Won't be back, there's just too much competition out there service and food wise. I suggest more training for your employees and a lesson in manners."}
{"text":"Went here for my girls bday -loved the marble lobby and walls where theres even a little video booth there to take selfies! Very cute photo op.  The actual dining room is very upbeat. It is still in tone with the marble theme and is a good balance of dressy meets semi casual. We went on a Sunday night so we saw a good mix of both.  The stars are down because of the food: My friends and I shared the truffle fries, mac and cheese, and scallops, while the table opted for the steak. The truffle fries are filling! The mac and cheese was made well, however it is nothing out of the ordinary for both. The scallops were cooked well, however I found it again to be nothing too special so overall yes I think a 3/5 for food is fair.  I do have to say the service was amazing: 5/5 very attentive and in a great mood to be helping us and building our experience, love it."}
{"text":"Best Steak Ever! However, the staffed kicked us out after 2 hours, despite our bill being over $900!! We arrived at 5 pm, they kept on walking by to refill our wine even though the glasses were clearly full. At 6:55 pm the waiter asked us if we wanted our dessert but told us that we had to eat quickly because we had to leave at 7 pm. We made the reservation one month ago and there were 5 empty tables around us. Paul, the sommelier, was the nicest guy in the world. Felt sorry for us and bought us a drink. Too bad he does not own the place, otherwise I would have come back. SHAME ON YOU! You would never do this to American's so why do it to us? Go back to the USA ...STK!"}
{"text":"I've been to many other STK locations and was so looking forward to this as I've loved every other experience. I have to say, overall, I was under-whelmed. The saga began with trying to obtain a reservation, which was nearly impossible for a weekend, despite the fact that I requested a very early reservation.  When my guest and I arrived, the restaurant was empty (despite the online reservations being 'sold out' at that time).   We were greeted and seated promptly, and our server was quite pleasant, although had difficulty in telling us about the specials, and did not suggest any wine or cocktail recommendations. The 'house bread' that was provided was supposed to be a house-made sourdough with blue cheese which sounds fantastic; instead, it was a stale loaf.   I must say that I DREAM about the 'lil brgrs at STK, but this experience was a let-down. The buns were stale and inedible, and although the burgers are supposed to arrive medium-rare, they were overcooked. Furthermore, they used to serve 3, and now they only have 2 (very small) sliders for $20 - not worth it!!  For my entree I chose the 6oz filet medallion ($39), medium rare, and it was cooked as such, accompanied by a chimichurri sauce. It was nicely cooked, but overly salted. My companion chose the 10oz strip steak with a horseradish sauce, and thought it was just adequate.  The dessert menu is not very extensive, thus we opted to pursue dessert elsewhere.  Overall, I've had much better experiences at other STK locations, and other steakhouses. For the price, I would rather go elsewhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"STK is 3/5 globally as far as I'm concerned. The steaks are slightly above average. All the sides are average at best. The atmosphere is wicked however which has me coming back occasionally to this location. It's best for a boys (or girls) night. You're not there for impressive meal but fun atmosphere. You are paying for that reason, not the food quality."}
{"text":"First of this place looks amazing aesthetically perfect -Service was great short rib was amazing!! Crispy shrimp is horrible cold on the inside -goose liver   was over cooked and tasted burnt. I would come back but def needs some tweaking"}
{"text":"Amazing service and attention to detail. Great interior design with a very cool bar. Get the 18oz steak with peppercorn and chimichurri on the side. The sliders are to die for, along with the lamb."}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday on Friday. It definitely had a nice, New York brunch kind of vibe. Very pricy and the food isn't even amazing. The appetizers were good. The steak was okay. Nothing amazing."}
{"text":"So we have the Millennial Wannabes staring at their phones and taking selfies for most of their (extended stay as long as we can cuz we don't get out much and we're ENTITLED too).  The forty something ladies dancing on chairs at the bar because of a different type of entitlement.    The bus boys who keep asking you to move your head so that they don't have to walk around the table to put aside your neighbors water.  The very (very) expensive wine that never gets to have the care or introduction of the sommelier.  Patrons shouting and cackling at intolerable levels, maybe just to get heard over the crazy loud sound system but more likely for the \"look at me I'm here\" impact.     And at best average food with steaks overcooked.  Well, if thats why you go to restaurants then you've found your place!   Me, I've given it three tries over a year now and I won't be back.   So unlike its locations in South Beach and Vegas and, short of the decor, so not worthy of the franchise name.    Management, you have some major work to do."}
{"text":"First and last visit to STK Toronto. Service was terrible and the food was okay, nothing special. Its way overpriced. I knew that it was going to be expensive, but I thought that I would get great service and food, but sadly, that was not the case. It was so hot in the restaurant that it made the dining experience even worse. Apps were boring, however, the steak was good, served exactly as ordered. Which was the only thing done right."}
{"text":"Visited STK Toronto and it was really good. We started off with the Beef Tartare and It was the best I've ever had. I always used to get the Beef Carpaccio but I guess they took it off the menu at all STK locations. I had the Bone-In-Filet and it was amazing. Cooked to a perfect medium and the blue butter as a dipping sauce was also incredible. The only thing I think this location needs help with is the service. It wasn't that great. The waiter made us wait about 10-15 min for our bill and wouldn't check up on us frequently. Besides that dinner was amazing"}
{"text":"Friday night and I had rounded up the dinner squad for an evening at STK, a modern steakhouse and party lounge hybrid in Toronto's flashy Yorkville district. As you arrive, it's hard not to miss the large sign - three, glowing alphabets glistening against a shiny black facade. A duo of well-suited bouncers usher me in as if I'm a regular here. Clearly, I look the part. They don't see the confusion on my face as I try to discern if I head up the winding stairs or go around the corner. What is this - a restaurant or a nightclub? I play it cool and head up the stairs. Good call.  At the top, a bevy of attractive hostesses are trying to accommodate three diners with no reservations. They immediately pause and acknowledge me, which only further fuels my now-elevated sense of self-worth. As I'm escorted past this trio of rookies, I find myself sashaying to the low thumping beats of club music...shoulders back, head held high, floating in an air of entitlement.  Thank goodness my squad's here to keep me grounded.  Nope, too late. They're already seated, glasses of golden bubbly in hand.  I'm discovering the essence of STK - it's a place to see and to be seen.  It's 6:30pm and the restaurant is already teeming with well-heeled diners. I won't lie - the space is sexy. It's chic, ultra-modern and perfect for a business meal or special occasion. The availability of several round booths and banquette seating also makes it an ideal venue for large groups - a bit of a rarity with fine-dining restaurants in Toronto.  I find myself suitably impressed with the seared foie gras starter - it boasts a texture of alluring silkiness blended with a mild kick of ginger gastrique. The tuna tartare, as my friend Gastroworld best described it, was \"boring but respectable\", and left a little more to be desired.  But we're here for one thing ... and that's the meat.  We opt for the $150 dry-aged 28oz porterhouse, the \"king of steaks\" known for its combination of the NY striploin and tender filet mignon. The steak is an admirable chunk of beef, but is served more cooked than the 'medium rare' we ordered. It arrives pre-sliced and the temperature is noticeably uneven. The meat has a soft blandness that may appease those who like their beef buttery, but will leave fans of dry-aged steaks a little dissatisfied.  STK is a likable addition to the Toronto steakhouse scene, fitting perfectly into the swank environs of its home neighbourhood. But it must be careful not to rest on the laurels of its global acclaim and perhaps work a little harder to carve its own niche in this unforgiving market.  One final word on branding: enough with the sexist contradictions already. STK's tagline, \"Not Your Daddy's Steakhouse\", presumably implies that women can love their meat and eat it too. Browse their Instagram account and you'll find lots of young women enjoying the STK life. Ironically though, most of them are not eating (let alone eating steak), but the drinks definitely seem to be flowing strong.  So much for trying to appeal to meat-loving women.   Clearly, this isn't the 'meat market' I was really, really hoping it would be."}
{"text":"I can understand why people don't give it great reviews. I live in New York and it can definitely be a stuffy place to go. But..... if you're with the right people, let it be about the food and ambiance, and not the other people around you. Restaurant is beautiful and the food is very good! Listen you can always find better steak. You can always find better salads. But overall, a great restaurant and the steak was awesome and the ambiance was great! Would come back again! A little on the pricey side but I'm use to it being from NY! Lol"}
{"text":"Came for drinks at the bar with a girlfriend on a Saturday and it was a great time. Great music, sparklers were being handed out, the staff were all dancing, quick to check in if we needed more drinks or food and the cocktails were strong but balanced. Highly recommend for girls night out!!"}
{"text":"Amazing service. Our server was always on point and the manager even offered a complimentary glass of champagne to celebrate my girlfriends birthday along with our dessert. He also recommended a shot of scotch to clear my chest! Food was delicious (Las Vegas location is still my favourite) and I believe the A/C may have been off since it was very warm in the restaurant. We had asked them to turn off the fireplace that was located behind our table as we were sweating while we were eating and couldn't fully enjoy the meal. Regardless, that's not fully their fault as it was a warm day in October and I assumed the contractor had shut off the a/c in most buildings throughout the city."}
{"text":"Great service, great food, great atmosphere. Only issue was seating. Had a reservation and got a pretty shitty table (crappy location) typically reservations would be prime spot of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I have come here 4 or 5 times now. I absolutely love the Sirloin steak that they serve. It is so tasty. On par with other top steak restaurants in Toronto. They have a great wine list and apparently Sunday's are half off bottles if memory serves me correct. The downside of this place are the side orders. I like the mushrooms and asparagus but I find most of them to be horribly disappointing. I wish they could do a better job with these. I love the table side ceasar salad at Jacobs and the rolls there, but STK is in the neighborhood. Hopefully they'll come up with some better side options - would not order the grits, mac & cheese or well most of the things that aren't vegetables."}
{"text":"I don't usually go to steakhouses but decided to come to STK for a girls night out. I absolutely love the décor and aesthetics of this restaurant, TOTALLY INSTAGRAM WORTHY LIKE YAAASSSSSS.  Even though it was on the pricey side, it had a soothing yet lively atmosphere with phenomenal service.   We ordered their signature wagyu beef burgers with caramelized onion, tomato, special sauce, and truffle oil, all on a mini house-made bun with house pickles on the side. The bun itself deserves 5 stars, it was so fresh and soft. Proceeded to order a bottle of wine and two appetizers (crispy shrimp and mushroom sides). The crispy shrimps were drenched in a super tasty sauce and the mushroom side was refreshing.   Didn't get to order dessert because we were out all day eating at different spots in Toronto. Will definitely have to comeback for the dessert as well as giving their steak a shot."}
{"text":"I love steak. I do not love steak houses. It always feels like you are being done a favour to be served at one. STK did not change my opinion much. It's patrons are a gaudy, preening Yorkville crowd. No one is really there to eat. Perhaps that's why the service is just so underwhelming. STK needs to hire and train their staff to care about their patron and the food they serve, not just look good.  Appetizers were mediocre at best. The steak I ate, a dry aged boneless rib, was delicious, however. The only reason I gave STK more than one star. But a delicious steak was not enough to make up for inattentive wait staff and a crowd more interested in the collagen injection they got last week. Any restaurant, especially overpriced steakhouses, need to provide a top experience. STK hits closer to the bottom. I'll gladly spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"So disappointed with how this place has progressively declined.  I've been 6 times since it's opening last November. First 3 were great. Since then it's gone downhill.  The good:  -Beautiful space -Potential for great food if the kitchen starts to pay attention again (Ie: DO NOT serve microwaved food, please) -awesome music  The bad: -what happened to the service??? Bartenders taking liberty to give and charge for doubles you never ordered (I'm not cheap, but $42 for 2 vodka sodas is a little much); Servers who take themselves a little too seriously, delivering the completely wrong food and blaming it on our table.  Overall just bad -last time I had my beloved short ribs they were microwaved. Come on! -the crowd is becoming a little too \"Yorkville\". Lots and lots of over-filled lips/cheeks looking for rich husbands. Actually, I take it back - the last point is a source of entertainment.  I've been wondering why I see so many promo emails out there advertising STK. Now I know why. They are hurting, and it's no wonder."}
{"text":"Way over priced. Definitely not worth the wait . Much better places around the city . Service was good. Dinner for 2 costs about 400 with wine . We left the place hungry ."}
{"text":"God I don't even know what to say about STK.  The steak really was amazing, the desert was something I'd actually travel for (and I don't like desert), the drinks were delish, and the decor was definitely interesting.  But man it falls apart from there.  One glass of wine took 20 mins to arrive.  But it really was the dismal group of people who crushed my soul.  Too done up, too much jewellery, too much Botox, so many people so interested in themselves.  Go, your stomach will thank you but unless you are nouveau riche your eyes might burn."}
{"text":"OK..I am going to be completely honest with this place Yelpers. This place is not for your average Joe looking for a nice evening. This is quite a different crowd and may not be for everyone. There's a ton of shady characters here and can be uncomfortable. This is a lounge first, pick up spot second, atmosphere third and food last. The prices are quite steep for the items and you will have a much better experience for steak at barbarians, Morton's, la castille or Jacobs. I tried foie gras and their tuna... Which both were 6/10. My buddy tried the steak and he likes it but said the price doesn't warrant the taste.  Service here is good... But the wait staff are trained on upselling as they have targets to hit per table as commission is involved.  Overall.. Great spot to chill and have some apps and look at some eye candy."}
{"text":"This place is boujee as hell so make sure you make a reservation 18 months ahead. The restaurant itself is beautiful, super insta baddie vibes if that's your whole purpose of going there. Otherwise, the hostess staff are alright, we were running 15 minutes late because of a road closure (love downtown Toronto!!!!!) and they made it seem like the end of the world. It was like 5pm who's really going to be dining there other than someone's sugar daddy. Anyways our server was DOPE, her service was top notch and she made us feel pampered. I was impressed that the managers actually came up to our table to chat with us. Made us feel a little more comfortable. and the food.... do not get me started. We ordered charity bread with chimichurri sauce (to die for). I ordered a medium rare STK ;)))) and it was cooked to perfection. I can't remember exactly but I'm pretty sure I ordered red wine sauce with the steak and it was delicious. Somehow our server got us to try the crab cakes and although they were fresh and tasty, $50.00 is wild for 2 crab cakes."}
{"text":"Came here for a special birthday celebration because we received a gift card to this new fancy hotspot in Yorkville. Overall, I didn't love the steak that we had. I didn't feel like it was worth the price paid. I didn't feel that the steak was significantly better than what I could find at The Keg. I probably would not come back again as there are so many other outstanding steakhouses in Toronto."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere here. Service is very friendly and accommodating. We had a wonderful meal with excellent service. I can't wait to go back next time I visit Toronto. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"1. Reservation experience:  Pleasant & friendly. 2. Reservation reminder from restaurant: BAD NEWS!  For a new establishment, they have to work on their PR skills.  We were reminded of our reservation and in the same breath felt almost threatened when she said, \" We only hold your reservation for 15 minutes and don't seat incomplete parties.\" 3. Dinner: We had to wait at the bar for about 10 minutes until we were seated even though the restaurant was half empty. (FYI- bartender had no clue what Blanton's whisky was and told us they didn't carry it. Surprise...it was right in front of her face but we and another bartender had to point it out to her!)  Pleasant waitress taking care of our table and very attentive additional staff. Steaks were yummy as was sea bass.  Sides were much too small for the price.  The waitress likely should've recommended we either double up on some of them or get more as four sides were absolutely not enough to go around for the six of us. 4. Dessert: Delicious semi-sweet chocolate cake.  Cookie with ice cream was small and a little under baked. 5. Amazing DJ.  Loved his song list the entire night! Atmosphere/decor was lovely.   6. Overall experience:  Considering STK has only been open a week, I will assume they will get even better once all the kinks are out. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Outstanding in every respect.  Everyone working there was super friendly, the food was out of this world, and they even had organic chicken.  And to top it all off, prices were very fair.  I was worried about $200 steaks but those seem King Kong portions for a few people.  The organic chicken was under $35.  We are talking organic at a super posh place.  Very, very fair and I would highly recommend STK"}
{"text":"Great ambience and vibe.  Definitely a place for a night out or social.  The food and service are impeccable.  The only downside were the truffle fries.  They were soggy when served to us, other than that, a gem in Toronto"}
{"text":"Upon entering, you'll be greeting with black and white modern decor and a BIG group of girls at the front desk. It seems like they just stand there and sing/dance in between greeting. It would be smart to put a few of these girls on the serving floor instead. The ladies told us we only had our table until 7:30pm due to a reservation. This didn't offend me considering we did not have a reservation ourselves.  Food:  I ordered the Strawberry Cobbler cocktail. It was AMAZING. I loved the graham cracker rim. Having these fresh drinks with a creative flair really elevate the cocktail menu. My husband also said his Old Fashioned was one of the best he's ever had. Hats off to the bartender! For dinner, I ordered a filet medallion and my husband ordered the dry-aged steak. Both of our steaks were slightly overdone, but we didn't complain. The options of choosing a crust and sauce were great. I didn't like the STK bold sauce as much as I wished. The peppercorn crust was really good though. I tried my husband's béarnaise sauce and that was delicious! As sides, we ordered the mac and cheese, tatertot poutine with bacon, and asparagus. I can't rave enough about how delicious the poutine was! For dessert, we got the warm chocolate chip cookie. It was very good too!  Service: We arrived around 5:30pm and the restaurant was quiet. Our server was very fast and attentive. Unfortunately, around 7pm, the tables were full and he was stretched VERY thin. My husband ordered another drink before dessert. Another server brought the dessert out, but no drink. A woman brought over the check and charged us for the drink he never received. After we sent the check back, our server showed up with the drink. We would have preferred to just have the drink off the check so we could just leave, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Food ***1/2 Service **** Ambiance **** (Out of 5)  A great place and a lot of fun.  The music is louder and it has a DJ I believe.  It's perfect for those looking for a fun / party vibe.    We had oysters as an appetizer but also tried the spanish octopus (not sure if this was in the menu!)  Oysters were creamy, fresh and fantastic.    Octopus was also on point and incredible - almost too good.    Mains included a filet mignon and king crab on top.  The steak while tasting good wasn't properly prepared - it was well done on the edges while rare on the inside - making me believe it wasn't brought to room temperature before cooking (hence 3.5* rating on food.). REGARDLESS it was still great and a solid cut of meat. The crab tasted fishy and had an odour to it.  The steak portion that I ate with the crab on top had that same taste - it was unfortunate!     Drinks included a paper plane and a Manhattan.  Both were excellent.  I always order my Manhattan's less sweet (I.e. less sweet vermouth) and this one was exactly how it should be made.    Service was on point and the wait staff was unassuming, pleasant and attentive.   Bravo!!  I think STK is top notch and will delight when the food gets perfected."}
