{"text":"This sandwich shop is really great.  When you step in it's like going into one of those deli/sandwich places in a big city like NY or Chicago (I'm saying this from my own experience). It's cozy and there's a lot going on.  The prices are totally reasonable as well, you can get a lot of sandwiches for around $5 or less and they taste great!  I don't think most of the ingredients are local, organic or anything fancy like that but this is reflected in the low prices.  I've found a lot of sandwich/burger places charging $10+ for something made with the same quality ingredients. Also, a lot of their stuff is made in house (it's not just dumped from a Sysco freezer bag into the fryer) and tastes great.  A few sandwiches that I particularly like are the meatball sub, the tuna melt, and the Chicago hot dog.  Another great thing about Crostini's is that they deliver for a reasonable price (it's a $10 minimum and less than $2 delivery fee), so if you're feeling lazy or overwhelmed you can get your food brought to your door! All-in-all I highly recommend this place for a well-made tasty sandwich."}
{"text":"Great sandwich shop! Very accommodating of special food needs/requests. Wish there was a meal deal and better variety of sides, but the food is delicious and the prices are great otherwise."}
{"text":"Service was quick, friendly and efficient for take out. The food is excellent and every time I have felt like I got my money's worth. 

Food quality is there, cooked well, fixed up well. 

Have had no problem with delivery time or order accuracy."}
{"text":"This was really good. We called ahead for 5 subs to go; everybody loved them. Even the little kiddies.  I Don't write yelp reviews very often, but these Sammies were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Food is great.  Customer service is one of the worst I have ever had!  I have ordered from them 3 times.  Each time I had a worse experience than the one before.  The first time, the order was about 15min. late, forgivable.  The second time, our order was over an hour late, no phone call to let me me know, Nothing.  The 2 times I called them, the response I got was \"the food was on it's way\".  Ok, shame on me for ordering from them again.  Trying to give them the benefit of the doubt.  This time (today), food was an hour late and they forgot a sandwich.  I called and asked to speak to the manager, the response \"he's too busy!!\"  I am still waiting for a phone call back.  Oh and the forgotten sandwich came 2.5 hours after it was suppose to be delivered!!

DO NOT EVER ORDER DELIVERY!!"}
{"text":"WOW  I have been eating my way thru the menu.  Everything is qreat quality and wonderfully priced.  The turkey apple cranberry  chutney panini is as good as it gets.  I also thought the cheeseburger to be great quality beef and one of the best Ive had anywhere,"}
{"text":"Someone recommended this place to me last week and I have been back 3 times since. I have had their philly cheesesteak, cheeseburger and their italian panini. All of them have been the best I have had. I am determined to have one of everything on their menu."}
{"text":"Worst service in Madison. We ordered online using grub pub, for delivery.  The order included one of their featured chicken sandwiches, two Chicago style hot dogs, one chili-mac, one potato and pasta salad.  The order took one hour and forty three minutes to arrive to the door, it was served by a delivery driver who was smoking a cigarette who appeared to have more people in the vehicle, the order was cold and incorrect.  I admit that delivery service in Madison slows down on a day that may have a few snow flurries, this day was no exception.  I do understand that when ordering on a day like this i may have to wait longer and that is perfectly fine, however, upon calling the restaurant and asking to speak with a manager, the man informed me that he was indeed the manager.  I then told him my food arrived cold and incorrect, and he told me that they could remake the order and it would be out to me in an hour and a half, for it takes one hour to prepare, and a half an hour to get to my door.  I expressed to the manager how long we had already been waiting to eat, and that we were not interested in waiting another hour and a half for the same cold food. The then told me that he could come back pick up the food and refund our money.  For all we wanted was to be full, we had began eating the cold food and this could not be an option. He then suggested that in the future if I want to order food that is delivered hot, I should order from a different restaurant with-in a block of my home.  Frustrated I told him that I would just write a review and I hung up the phone.  So here it is.  Ten minutes later, another \"manager\" called back concerning the order, he assured me that the next time i order it would be on them.  That's fine, however I don't think I'll be ordering from Crostini ever again, it should not take an hour to prepare a couple of hot dogs, a sandwich and a few sides.  Very disappointing, and to be told by one of their managers to just bring my business elsewhere if i want hot food, seems pretty ridiculous to me.  I also must admit I feel bad writing this review but it's simply the truth."}
{"text":"Everything I have ever gotten from here has been amazing.  All the chicken panini's and anything else you order you won't be disappointed. I'm originally from chicago and i am so happy I can get a little taste of home. Plus everyone that works there is always the greatest."}
{"text":"After a variety of businesses moved in and out of this small building on North St. in a short time, I felt like the location was doomed. Yet, Crostini has been here for more than a few years now, and seems to be doing great, and for good reason! Their extensive menu has something for all palates, and the service is quick and friendly. I've never had something I didn't like. My go-to, however, has always been the Italian beef sandwich - get it with the spicy peppers, skip the cheese, and make sure it's wet! If you go in the summer, the front patio is small but lovely and they have recently expanded into the space next door, making it much more accommodating for larger groups of people."}
{"text":"If you are looking for delicious sustenance with substance, flavors and textures, you gotta check this out! I'd never had panini before, and they served up an amazing meal, even on my shoestring budget. Bravo! I'll be back! Yum-o!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Tasty sandwiches and specials. I've never had a problem finding a close parking spot. When they're cooking the spicy chicken I can't be in there (yes, it's that strong), but I always get my sandwich to go so not a problem."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for 2 sandwhiches and bowl of chili. Chili was warm at best and there was Mayo on the sandwich....got delivered 45 minutes after closing time so there is no one to complain to or to try and make it right.. Just an answering machine..WoW."}
{"text":"I had the beef and cheese Panini and it was wickedly good best panini ahead and one time and I live in Chicago"}
{"text":"I'm angry I have to give this place a single star.

My work, a place which places 9-10 orders every single day from Crostini's. And on the past three Saturdays that we have ordered from here. The first time, it took 3 hours to get our food, and they forgot one of the Cheesecake's we ordered. When calling them back, it took another hour and a half to get a single piece of cheesecake brought back to us. When we called and complained to the \"manager\" they gave us a 10% discount on our food on the next order. 

We called the Saturday after, and it took 2 hours to get our order. We called back and they basically said \"Oh well, there was nothing they could do.\"

We gave them one more chance today. We ordered our food at approximately 1pm. It's now 3:30pm and we have no food. We've called them four different times. Twice they've told us the driver had already left and would be here soon. That was 45 minutes ago. When calling back just now they don't even know where the driver is. Not to mention, on top of that, when we placed our first order, we ordered an order of fries. An hour later when our food wasn't here (Estimated 30 minute deliver time) we were told that the fry truck wasn't there for them to make the fries, which was the delay. Why not just say that right away when someone orders something you don't have in stock. It's ridiculous a company would completely lose a delivery driver and have no idea where he is. 

Update: It's 4pm. We got our food. The food is ice cold, the driver appeared stoned out of his mind when he got here, and they forgot several items from our order. Thankfully they didn't charge us for the order, but this entire service experience was terrible. On our call back to complain about the food that -wasn't- delivered as part of the order, we were told \"Since you're not paying for it, we're not bringing out more food that you won't pay for\". Eventually, we got them to agree to send out the food from the original order.

This entire issue could be solved by finding a competent delivery driver. He drives here 7 days a week. He should know how to get here without getting lost by now.

Our company has decided to cease spending upwards of $1,000 a week at Crostini's. We'll give our business to their direct competition if its in any way more competent then they are."}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches. Prices are a little too high in my opinion, but good food. I've been here once and was completely overwhelmed with the amount of menu items. I ended up choosing the caprese panini. Needed more pesto, but was still delicious. Adorable tiny store with yummy food and good jazz music playing over the speakers!"}
{"text":"Best Chicago Italian Beef I have had outside Chicago. The owner recommended the Italian Beef. He was very friendly and helpful. The sandwich was perfectly crunchy and tasted fresh. Throw some fresh, homemade giardiniera on top and a free fresh baked cookie on the side. I'm sold."}
{"text":"Good food but 2 out of 3 times when I order whole wheat bread or a whole wheat wrap they give me white bread or a white wrap. I am health conscious so this is very frustrating and I get it on my lunch break so I can't have them fix it. I just have to eat the refined carbs and deal with it. I guess I just have to check my order every time, which is frustrating and wastes my precious lunch time. 

The other thing is they have absolutely terrible ventilation inside so make sure you order ahead and only get the food to go otherwise you will smell like a kitchen for the rest of the day.

UPDATE: ventilation problem has been solved as they have expanded so it's not as enclosed. No more issues with the bread being mixed up. Back to being delicious and my go-to lunch spot."}
{"text":"I needed to grab something for lunch and feeling sick of the usual sandwich suspects of Subway and Milio's etc. I thought I would Yelp 'Sandwiches' near my work place. Crostini came up as 3 minutes away and had good ratings so I thought I would try it out. Together with two co workers we drove over there and were very impressed. We found street parking right across the street and the outdoor seating area looked nice. The daily special was listed on a chalkboard out front. Once inside there are seemingly endless delicious items to chose from on the menu boards. Finally, I opted for the Chicken pesto Panini and a Ceasar Salad along with the freshly brewed ice tea. My co workers order the Egg Salad Sandwich and Turkey Cran-Apple Chutney Panini and a chocolate malt. After a short wait one of the employees brought us our food to go. (I had read in the Yelp reviews some folks got a free cookie for their first visit, unfortunately, we didn't get one, either I failed to mention it was our first time or we weren't asked-oh well). 
At first I noticed there were no croutons on the ceasar salad and was momentarily disappointed, however, the parmesan on the salad made up for it as well as the awesome dressing and fresh lettuce as well as a hard boiled egg. I never ended up missing the croutons and think they would have been too filling and excessive.
My Panini was great. The portion size was very generous and there was no lack of gooey melted yummy cheese goodness. The chicken breast on the Panini was really good, flavorful and a nice cut of meet. The fresh avocado and spinach was tasty. My ice tea was also delicious, served with a fresh lemon slice (optional).
My co workers were also very impressed with their meals. 
We will be back!!!!!!!!!! And I will bring more customers."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I got a chicken bacon avocado panini and it was really good. My husband got their house sub ( we can't remember the name) but it was really good too. It is a little pricy at 8 or 9 per sandwich but they use quality ingredients so it's definitely worth it.  Oh and we got complimentary chocolate chip cookies and those were delicious too! Definitely going back but probably only for carryout as there are only a few seats available."}
{"text":"Wow so disappointed. I just picked up a bowl of their homemade chicken noodle soup which is just a big bowl of noodles in water with a couple of dry pieces of chicken and a couple of chunks of vegetables no flavor very very disappointed... I would have just opened a can of soup at home if I would have known!"}
{"text":"I had the California Chicken wrap and the Chicago style hot dog last week and it was great.  The delivery was on time and the food tasted great.  You could tell that everything was really fresh.  The yelp ordering through the app makes it very easy and convenient."}
{"text":"Totally impressed!! Great service, music ad food.  Got cookies on the house for being a first timer!  Very small, casual and very friendly."}
{"text":"DONT BELIEVE THE INSTAGRAM WEEKLY WINNER COMPETITION

but other than that sandwiches are amazing - staff are nice and overall super cute mom and pop shop. I would boycott them if their food wasn't so good ( you now get 4 stars instead of 5) . I'm still heartbroken about this Instagram competition - need to work on your PR Crostini sandwiches

Panini's are the best - pasta salad not so much."}
{"text":"Delicious- The service is great, the food is fantastic and they heve GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS! The Italian Beef rocks, and the turkey/ cranberry panini is also great. They serve San Pellegrino and other upmarket bevvies,, and then there's the free cookie.... Eaten here about a half dozen times. Try it, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Delicious!  I had the turkey Panini and homemade potato leek soup.  So Good.  Super friendly staff and great, affordable menu.

Office outing for lunch today!"}
{"text":"Yes, it doesnt have a bathroom, easy parking, and huge sandwiches, but what they do have are sandwiches with quality ingredients and tons of flavor.  I had the crostini club sandwich and was happy with the all of flavors going on inside.  I'll be back for the italian beef shortly and I can't wait"}
{"text":"With a few exceptions, I've never met an owner of a local sandwich shop who takes so much pride in his work, and offers such outstanding customer service - not only from himself, but from his employees as well. Crostini wants you to have a great sandwich and a great experience ordering it, paying for it and, eventually, eating the glory that is their food. 
With that said, I have to say that everything on their menu is a testament to the management and ownership WANTING you to have a great meal; not just wanting to make a buck. To wit: I've trod nearly every item on their menu (they're in my neighborhood) and have had the experience of a few sub-excellent sandwiches. This isn't to say they were bad, but merely not amazing. 
The owner and staff recognize my face from so many visits and often ask me about how my last sandwich was. Being a former chef, I'm not too afraid to speak truth to their queries. On the rare occasion that something wasn't up to mine, and presumably their, incredibly high standards - they took my comments in stride and more often than not I would later find the item either removed from the menu or re-tooled into a culinary masterpiece of sandwich art that is their forte. 
With all that backstory aside, I just can't speak highly enough about their food. My go to sandwich, for when I just don't even want to think about what would taste amazing while satiating both myself and my wife, is the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. Its simplicity is sublime, its execution near flawless (maybe 1/3 less mayo and 1/2 more lettuce would help it reach nirvana). Spicy, but not unbearably so, it comes with an assortment of flavor profiles that meld into a thing of beauty. 
If you're looking for something more simple, and possibly more Chicagoan (you damn FIB), their various Italian beef incarnations are all equally perfect in their own special way. 
My cut and dried, highly compressed review of the place would be this:
\"If your sandwich doesn't taste amazing, it's because you chose something you weren't in the mood for, not due to any issues with the recipes or a failure of a dutiful lack of execution.\"
All in all, Crostini is a little miracle on North St. 
In a space once operated by Milio's; slanging bottom of the barrel meats and vegetables for an equivalent price - there now stands a shop so invested in your gastronomical pleasure that they offer free homemade (delicious) chocolate chip cookies to all comers, and, with the utmost sincerity, want you to become addicted to their food. 
I wish every person in the world the ability to dine on one truly delicious sandwich in their life. 
I'm proud to say that the location to achieve that aim in just two blocks from my house, on the near East-Side. 

Insiders aside: always ask about their specials. Yet another facet of this place that has never let me down, so long as it was something I was in the mood for."}
{"text":"First time here, ordered the California panini and my wife's ordered a Philly cheesesteak. Both orders came out quickly. The panini was cooked perfectly. It had a great pesto and juicy tomatoes in it. Both orders came with a small delicious chocolate chip cookie (not sure if that is typical or just because of the holidays). There are plenty of spots to sit inside. The ambience is lacking but the food more than makes up for it. Give this place a try and you'll be happy you did!"}
{"text":"Best Italian beef shop that we have in Madison. The sandwich is always packed with meat and as an add bonus great ppl work here."}
{"text":"I love crostini's food, I really do. Unfortunately, their customer service is lacking terribly. I have ordered about 10 times and half the time I usually end up with something wrong or missing. I let it go because the food is still good. 

Today, I couldn't answer the phone when they called because I was on the other line with a client, so I ran downstairs because I figured the call meant they were here. I waited at my front door for 10 minutes and no one came. 
A half hour later I called the shop asking if my food was on its way (it'd been 1 hr 15 min) and they told me the driver said I didn't answer my phone OR door. The driver never even came to my door, I was down there waiting for him. And to call once and leave it at that? Terrible customer service. It's now been an hour and 25 minutes that I've been waiting for ONE SANDWICH. 
Twice in the past the driver did not have change with him when he showed up for a delivery. They need to get themselves together or hire a new staff.

UPDATE: they ended up comping my food, so I upgraded the review to 3 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today. Even with construction I was able to park right next door. First time here. Staff was very friendly and the owner explained the specials and what their specialties are. They have a ton of food options. Why did I wait so long to come here. I may come back tonight for pasta dinner. I got the Club Supreme sub for lunch with chips and a free cookie. Will definitely come back on a regular basis! :)"}
{"text":"Can't complain. This place is conveniently located near my house. This is our go-to place for our lazy nights when we are definitely not cooking but are in need of a dinner that is not cereal.
They have a lot of Gluten free options delivery and pickup. They have a punch card that when you fill it up you get $5.00 off. 
My Husband loves their cheesesteaks and we are transplants from Philly so I think that's saying something. I usually get the spicy chicken without bacon and no cheese because I am no fun :oP
this is a great place to have in the hood and many nights i'd go hungry without them."}
{"text":"the owner and staff were awesome.  they gave me a piece of chocolate cake for my birthday.  it too was delicious.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I ate at Crostini as I was passing through Madison to Chicago. The owner was very friendly and the panini pressed sandwiches were delicious. I split the farmer's market and turkey, spinach and artichoke paninis with a friend. Both were fresh and flavorful. They have gluten free and vegetarian options as well. Also, the jazz piano music playing in the background was a nice touch."}
{"text":"I love that they have delicious gluten free options, fresh, interesting, and kind. I have training three days in a row nearby and am going to get something different everyday. So excited."}
{"text":"Delivery via Grubhub/EatStreet is always fast (20-30 min tops) and food is hot and fresh. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Really did not feel like cooking one night and so I used Eat Street to deliver me some goodness!  I decided to try their Mac and Cheese. Huge portion!  It was easily 2 meals.  It was very good Mac and Cheese. My mom got a Turkey sandwich that was also very tasty. Yummy food, will be ordering from them again!"}
{"text":"Since the last time I've been to Crostini, their food presentation has gone down tremendously. My Chicago dog was unorganized and thrown together, the cheese curds have way too much cheese in them and are too large in general. The ketchup obviously isn't refrigerated due to its fermented taste. The floors are incredibly slippery but that can be caused from not using degreaser when you mop, safety hazard. I expected more and hope that things improve. It could be such a nice spot."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are delicious. It really seems like great care is taken with the food. 

The hot sandwiches hit the grill for a few minutes, worth the wait. The veggie panini has a great garlicky flavor, and is served on soft toasty bread. With a mixed veggie medley & cheese, it sounded strange but is an unlikely winner.  I bet any other veggie sandwich combos they come up with would be stellar.

The cold egg salad sandwich is solid too. 

Nice service."}
{"text":"When we found this place the food and service was A1. Tonight we ordered and told them to deliver 1 1/2 hours later.  Not only was our order late  it was cold.  We called and spoke to the owner and this man was so rude. We told him what happened and he was trying to make excuses for the driver, we have them plenty of time to get here. So he said it would be a couple of hours before they would get here. So we asked for our money back and they did bring that and it took only 15 min."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch around 1 on a Saturday. It wasn't busy but it took a bit to make the sandwiches (a good sign). We chose the cubano, a spicy chicken panini and an ultimate grilled cheese. The spicy chicken panini was made with buffalo spicy wing sauce which isn't to our taste but the chicken seemed to be of good quality. We really enjoyed the cubano. The grilled cheese was nice. The bread on the panini's was of a fine enough crumb to not scrape up the roof of the mouth when bitten. We look forward to coming back to try some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"I had pretty much been ignoring this place since it opened because I can't eat gluten, so I was assuming that sandwiches=glutenous bread. Last week my partner was all like, \"Ever been to this place?\" and I was all like, \"Um, I haven't been to a sandwich shop in years.\" But he checked out the menu online and they had some gluten free options, so we decided to check it out. And I am so glad we did. Oh! You have no idea how wonderful it is to taste a damn good sandwich after years of eating bread that tastes like sand. I had the California Chicken panini. It was the stuff of dreams. Hot, gooey, cheesy, flavorful dreams. I am looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 3 times, and it's always been pretty good.  The sandwiches are pretty tasty. The soup is good. They give you free cookies. I had a pesto pasta salad that was also good. Nothing amazing, just solid food.

The staff is extremely nice. They cook everything fresh, so it does take a bit for them to cook your food. They do deliver, so that is a great option."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness! How many places have you been to that give you a FREE cookie just because it's your first time visiting?? Crostini does!! 

Free cookie+bag of pickles+delicious sandwiches+good customer service= pretty great experience. 

OK. On to the sandwiches. I ordered the Farmer's Market. I have never experienced a sandwich with potato as the main part of it before. It was tasty and definitely filling. The sautéed peppers were also very yum! There were so many flavors wrapped into this sandwich. My husband ordered the Chicago Style Italian Beef. He enjoyed it, but it wasn't his favorite. 

We will definitely go back next time we want to have a picnic in downtown Madison!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian beef sandwiches in the city. With cheese, dry or wet, peppers on or side, it's quick and awesome."}
{"text":"I can't say I've ever had a problem with my order here, but I do only ever order one thing for myself each time I go here. I've always had incredibly friendly service when I walk in, and my order is always ready. I work in the area and there are not a TON of good restaurants around, so this is often a go-to for me. I can't say the food here is going to knock anyone's socks off, but it is absolutely above average and quite tasty. Plus, it's always fun to go to your small, local stores!"}
{"text":"Big menu, good prices, super awesome employees.  There's not a lot of food options in this area but it beats Milio's up the street.  If you're new, the employees are always super helpful and can recommend something.  I was recommended the Italian beef sandwich the first time I went in - delicious."}
{"text":"Heard about the Italian beef, so figured I give it a try for lunch.  Wow, it was great!  Soft tender roll, delicous lean meat and glorious peppers.  Everything just right.  Come and enjoy."}
{"text":"I stopped in after a long day for a quick sandwich, and ended up with a gyro and some chips. Was pleasantly surprised by a small dessert cookie and quite satisfied by the food quality. Based on the menu, this place can stand toe to toe with any chain sandwich shop in both price and offerings. There's plenty of classics and unique items to choose from.

The staff was super friendly and really helped me feel welcome (they didn't know I wasn't in a great mood), which made me much happier. 

There's plenty of seating, but it's not fancy and seems kind of underutilized.

I'd say overall it's worth stopping in to grab a quick bite or take something home, and I would consider catering with them, but it's not gonna be a place you'll want to sit and stay for a family dinner."}
{"text":"Great food awesome service . Had Meatball sandwich it was excellent. Great place diamond in the rough!!!!!! Keep up the hard work guys your doing excellent job with your food and service !!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place via a google search for Italian Deli's in Madison last Friday and was very pleased with the results.  I had woke up that morning thinking about a good deli style Italian sandwich and this totally satisfied my craving.  While waiting for my sandwich I learned they also deliver within 5 miles and have Italian Beef sandwiches!  I move up here from Chicago 7 years ago and have been unsuccessfully looking for an authentic Italian Beef joint since.  So today, my fellow Chi-town transplants and I all ordered Italian Beef sandwiches and were really impressed.  This was not the typical Madison version Italian Beef sandwich (what we call French Dip in Chicago), but a real honest sloppy and savory Italian Beef.  If you live/work around the East Side of Madison and you haven't tried this place, you are missing out.  This has definitely been added to our short list of favorite lunch spots near work.

On a side note, one of my coworkers is gluten intolerant and found out that all of their stuff can be made gluten-free.  I think she was more excited than me :)"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery at 12:40 today and was told to expect a 45 minute wait. 
After an hour an fifteen I called and was told my food was out with the driver and I should expect it shortly. 
35 more minutes go by and I call again. I am told that my food was in fact not out before but rather it just went out five minutes prior to me calling. They apologize and say I should expect it very soon. 
35 minutes later I leave and go to Elas deli. 
I'm sitting here now and I just called to check on my order, it's now 3:12 and I am told once again that it just want out an is on the way. 
Needless to say I cancelled the order. 


Times they have delivered it's always been an hour or more and the food is below average. Price  is unreasonable for their service and quality. 
They are disorganized as a business and an embarrassment to the industry that I have worked in for a decade. 

Never relying on them to feed my family again. 

Did I mention that I waited 2 and a half hours and I live only several blocks away? 
Or that they lied to me several times about my order? 

Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"This is located in one of those buildings where many businesses come and go so I tend not to pay attention. Finally I realized just how long Crostini has been there; must be doing something right!

We did a pick up order. It was a little chaotic on the pick up and pay. They didn't seem to know if some items were packaged or not. I didn't know if we'd find things missing or duplicated. From other reviews it seems like that's part of the adventure. In actuality only a cookie with the kid's sandwich was missing. 

Our group ordered a Rueben, Italian beef, Italian combo (beef+sausage), a kid's turkey sub, and an egg salad sandwich. Everyone like their food and no one was seriously disappointed at the size but \"there should have been more egg salad for the amount of bread.\"

The kid's meal was missing the cookie and had no mayo or mustard on it which we found odd but we just added our own. The Italian beef was quite good but not Chicago good where both diners grew up.)

We will definitely order from there again when the time is right. It's right in our neighborhood and a good delicious time was had by all."}
{"text":"Prices are great for the quality! I had the California Chicken Panini. The chicken breast was large and moist. Portion was large enough that a side wasn't necessary. Guys working there were attentive and friendly. Casual atmosphere with a couple tables outside. Outstanding for the price."}
{"text":"After hearing amazing things about Crostini, I was completely disappointed. Hype. That is all this place has. I was under the impression from the website and pictures it was a cafe of sorts. It was tables out front. 

Well it turns out, it is basically a counter place with a few tables available. The space is cramped and there are no public restrooms.  This would be nice to know. Please post a sign. Otherwise, your patrons will have to wait in line to ask for a bathroom and then find out there isn't one. That is pretty time consuming and annoying for goodness sake.  They then sent me to a neighboring business which had disgusting bathrooms. Not necessarily their fault but don't send your patrons to a dirty place because that still reflects on you.

Parking. Ugh. Not clear. I called Crostini and asked if the lot on the corner was acceptable.Question: Are you a patron of the this strip mall and if so, can I use this lot. Answer from the Crostini employee: No, but you would be. What does that even mean?  Are you getting me on a technicality of grammar?  Truthfully it would be much more efficient to just clearly state whether or not I could park there.

Now the food. I tried the meatball sub. It is $6.59. I am the kind of person who is willing to pay for good food. However, this is an astronomical price for a small (maybe 5 inch) sandwich with no side. This was a tasty meatball sandwich but it was nothing special. My husband ordered a panini and the portion was pretty tiny.

Sure, they give out free chocolate chip cookies but it does not make up for the lack of value on your food. I wanted to add something to my order but I assumed that my food would be up any minute. I sat there for about 25 minutes from ordering. They were not busy. One of the cooks was conversing with his friend about the weekend and whether he made it to Waterloo. Great, talk about your weekend but where is my food?

Skip Crostini and walk across the street to Dexter's. The wait is the same but the value is better. And the portions are much more generous."}
{"text":"I had one friend tell me this place was amazing.  I had never heard of them, so next time I was at the barbershop I asked around.  If you've ever seen the movie Coming to America, or, well, Barbershop, you know everyone at the neighborhood barbershop is an expert at everything and nothing.  The consensus there was that it was ok, but way overpriced for small sandwiches, so I didnt bother for a while.

I dont know why I listened to them fools.  Yesterday I was in the mood for a deli sandwich and my usual spot closed early, so I decided to give them a try.  They didnt really have deli sandwiches, but what I did try was great.

First thing I tried was the spicy chicken sandwich.  I ordered hoping it wasnt a buffalo chicken sandwich.  It was definitely their take on a buffalo chicken sandwich, but different and better.  I got it grilled.  It has a hint of cajun seasoning in it as well.

I also got an Italian combo, as I havent found one I LOVE in Madison since Deli Roma closed.  Well, now I have.  It was well seasoned, full of flavor, dipped without being so soggy you cant pick it up.

Sandwiches are $6-9 and average size so, yes, not fast food prices, but not outrageous.  How much do you spend on a sandwich at Applebees anyways?  About the same and it's not as good.

Going back tonight to try more things.

UPDATE:  I tried more things!

Some sandwiches are indeed small.  The reuben had great flavor but I expected more for an $8 sandwich.  Same with the club supreme, although I'll probably get the club supreme again.  If I want a big reuben I go to BBQ Joint, if I want a small one I go to Sliced.

Biggest \"miss\" I tried so far?  The chicken pesto panini.  Also kind of small, but more importantly, their pesto is not pestoy at all to me.  It looked and tasted more like mediocre guacamole.  I did not enjoy this one at all.

I have gotten the spicy chicken and italian combo three times EACH in the last week.  Crostini's is still a big win."}
{"text":"After reading all of these great 5 star reviews, I wanted to love Crostini. I really did, but i'm so sad to say my experience there was not very good. 

So for those you of that have never tried it, here is an overview with my yesterday experiences:
Parking was complicated. There is not really a designated parking area that I could find. There are signs that say for the apartment complex \"corner parking only\" which I was a little confused by. I did ask the Crostini employees, and they said they thought it was ok to park in those spots. So yeah....not sure if they have parking or don't?
Mad construction right now all around Crostini, but I give them mad props for staying open during it! Good work on that. 

No Bathrooms! None.
So if you have to use a bathroom, go before you come here, or as my wife said to me, \"if you can deal with the grossness of the bathroom around the corner at the coffee shop, which will remain nameless\", you can use that one if you buy something there. 

Atmosphere: Pretty chill jazz music in the back ground, very clean! A good place to sit and read a book outside. Good for 1 or 2 people (not larger groups). 

Ok, so usually I can deal with confusing parking, construction, and no bathroom but here is the kicker...
From the time we ordered our food, sat and waited......food to go. It took a solid 25 minutes--- With no line....
There was a group of 3 people, that looked like they had been there awhile waiting for their food as well. They finally recieved their food and I heard the counter girl say, \"sorry for the wait, I put a bunch of $1 off coupons in your bag for next time\". 

After these people left, My wife and I were the only customer there, and I still sat for at least 10 minutes more waiting for my food. 2 panini's only!!!! Seriously. A Meatball panini and a gyro panini. That was all I ordered.

Toward the end of waiting after the only other poeple in the place left another guy came in and a employee working there must have known him and decided to have a conversation with the guy about the night before and where they partied (he was also ordering food). Rather than continue making my order, I seriously was a second away from asking for my $ back and just leaving. 

The food:
My Gyro Panini was pretty tiny considering it was over $6. It tasted good, I'll give them that. It did not come with any side (a very small pickle and green olive only) But there is no way I'm headed back there to pay that much $ for a small grilled cheese, looked like standard cheap (very cheap) white bread and a couple of small pieces of beef/lamb slapped together and crushed with 1 slice of chedder. Nope. 
My wife got a Meatball Panini. I ate 1/4 it because I was starving after my small panini which felt like I had ate an appetizer. Her's was about double the size of mine but lacked flavor. It was meatballs, cheese and bread. Pretty much a meatball sub (but they called it a panini???)
So the food was nothing even close to resembeling 5 stars. What a let down. I'd say 2 to 3 stars if they are lucky. 

The place is tiny. Don't expect to find enough room to have a nice sit down meal if you have multiple people in your group, and just a heads up it's an \"order at the counter and wait for your food\" kind of place, which is ok. There is nothing wrong with that, but I guess for the person reading this Yelp review, they might want to know that before thinking they are headed there for a nice sit down with a server type of meal---It's not like that. 

I did get  my free chocolate cookie, as I read on other Yelp reviews about. Yup, it was a cookie. 
Unlike the people that sat and waited who knows how long before me I was not offered a \"sorry for the wait\" or any $1 off coupons. 
Just a--- Here is your food, and a bag pushed my way from behind the counter. 

So Yeah, not what I was expecting based off all the great reviews.
I'm really bummed about this one. I just feel like I missed out on something that every one keeps saying is so awesome. Man, maybe it was just bad timing...I don't know. I'm just really bummed that this place was not as awesome as everyone said it was. 
I should have taken a picture of my tiny panini to show you all (but i didn't) sorry, I was just so hungry from waiting for so long that I never thought of it.  I don't want to shame Crostini and more than I have.....because obviously there are 5 star reviewers out there who love this place, and I wish I had been one of them."}
{"text":"Get the Italian Beef. Amazing. I thought I'd had the best Italian Beef when Papa Coronofolous' was still open, but I was so wrong. When I opened the to-go box, my first reaction was to say. \"F**k yeah!\" This is a big sandwich with mozz and peppers (optional). And the price is not just reasonable, it's generous. Seriously, skip the chips, you won't finish them. But take the free cookie; they're awesome. Like a chocolate chip molasses cookie.

Crostini's may be a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but go a little out of the way. It's SO worth it."}
{"text":"Our food was great! Pesto pasta with garlic bread, farmer's market panini and chicken avocado panini! Everyone was happy. Small place so if you have a group you will want to take advantage of the outside deleting. No restrooms, though, so take that business elsewhere!"}
{"text":"I've only gotten delivery from here but everything is always amazing! Reasonable pricing and huge portions. The panini sate huge and delicious. The Chicago style hot dogs and chili cheese dogs are incredible. Gyro is gigantic and yummy. I could go on and on. Love it all! .... Never mind apparently I was outside of their delivery area but the app was still allowing me to order and instead of speaking to me like an adult and explaining the situation they decided to send me my order with all portions cut in half. Charged me full price and I gave the driver a $12 tip as I always do. Everything was cold and they very intentionally left toppings off and literally cut my chocolate cake in half and sent it. Cool"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!!! I had the California chicken sandwich and added red onions.  This is an amazing sandwich and I could eat this every day.  Their broccoli cheese soup is great!  Fast and friendly service.  I will definitely be going back here over and over and over"}
{"text":"This is a tough one. The sandwiches are four-star, maybe five, but there were some bummers to the catering order I recently placed. Nothing horrendously wrong, by any means, but nothing that wowed me. A-OK describes my experience perfectly. 

+ You can place catering orders online through a popular Madison food delivery service. 
- There are no directions or details for catering orders; it lists the number of sandwich halves and cookies you'll get, but that's it. 
+ My delivery order arrived on time; I placed it three days before the event. 
- Despite putting detailed directions on how to find us (I was at a private party at a business), the driver couldn't find us and was wandering the apartment building next door. I was running an event in a basement-level business - if I hadn't had my phone or had reception I don't know if he'd had found us.
+ The sandwiches were delicious and came in a nice carrying case.
- The cookies had squared-off sides and looked to be mass produced. 
- There were no vegetarian options in the box even though they have a couple veggie subs on the menu. 
- There were no plates, napkins, or condiments; there was no mention of this, but for catering that's a pretty common inclusion. 

The most important thing, though, is the food, and the sandwiches got gobbled up in quick fashion. As a huge turkey sandwich fan, I can put my stamp on their version. It reminded me in one bite of the deli sandwiches I used to order when living out East. I had forgotten about these sandwiches entirely but their sauce/spices took me back. I will definitely order that sandwich again. It's nothing fancy, but I totally dug it. 

Looking forward to trying them in a non-catering capacity, and now that I've experienced their catering I know some handy facts for next time (such as trying to contact the store directly to inquire about including veg items in my order)."}
{"text":"Randomly happened upon it. Had the veggie pita melt. Boyfriend had the chicken Parmesan Sammy. Friendly customer service. Delicious! Will be back."}
{"text":"Right now this is my favorite place for delivery after a night out. 

The burger at $5 is a fantastic deal. The first time I ordered based on price I expected a sad little burger, totally wrong! I've gotten the burger 3 times now (always with added bacon) and it's been great every time. 

The Chili Mac is another favorite. Total comfort food and super cheap. 

I also love that you can get awesome tea's from the place next door (except Monday's). On Mondays we get the house lemonade which is fantastic; best lemonade in town; not that I can think of another place I get lemonade.

All and all just really happy this place is in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"The sandwiches sure hit the spot. Great for takeaway."}
{"text":"Yum yum! I'm at work tonight and I got hungry and I remembered how much I liked Crostini the last time I ordered it. Tonight I got the turkey/artichoke/spinach panini and their signature salad. I must say, I chose very well! That panini was so delicious. I've had other things in the past, but I'm pretty sure I'm always going to get this one from now on. However, the signature salad is amazing! Sure, you say, it's greens and good toppings with a nice dressing. But you obviously don't realize how good a combination it all is!! Good fresh mixed greens, artichokes, broccoli, olives, beans, Parmesan and other veggies. I'm only complaint is that I overdressed it, but that's my fault (the dressing comes on the side). I'll definitely be getting this again! It's all very reasonably priced and was delivered quickly."}
{"text":"This little hole in the wall has been surprisingly successful given its odd location. They deliver sandwiches and some other hot dishes fairly quickly, at a better quality than any fast food in the area, and both faster and cheaper than you'd get with a sit down restaurant (they do have a dine-in area but it's order-at-the-counter, and they also deliver).

The California chicken panini and Chicago dogs are our favorites, but almost everything we've had there is good. The Wisconsin mac and cheese is made with some good quality cheese, and big enough to split one order between our two young kids. The fried cheese curds, however, are bland. 

They've expanded fairly recently into the next lot over, so there is always a decent amount of dining space (and space for kids to run around and not get in anyone's way). It could really use a makeover, but considering how difficult it has been for restaurants in this location to stay in business, I don't hold that against them."}
{"text":"Crostini's food has always been stellar.  They always offer a vegetarian option as one of their daily specials, and their service has been great every time!"}
{"text":"Great food that mostly seems to be made in house. The prepackaged house salad was surprisingly delicious! Excellent customer service and a willingness to customize dishes. You can add seasonal veggies to the pastas and can get a homemade chocolate chip cookie all for free! Will definitely be returning. Not sure how I managed to miss this gem for a whole year."}
{"text":"Love this place! All the soups are great! Its very difficult to find something back. I had the Waca Waca with chicken today, it was a special. It was AMAZING! just the right combination of spicy and delicious!"}
{"text":"The dankity of dankness. Lunch was fast and delicious. Went with the Cubano sandwich and enjoyed the honey mustard type sauce on it. The meat was a good amount and seemed quality."}
{"text":"Went to eat at 8:34 & was told I just missed the opportunity eat there because they closed at 8:30. I said but your door is open & lights are on. He basically said to bad. Will not go back. I asked his name, told him I was posting a yelp review. He didn't say a word & shut the door in my face"}
{"text":"Great deli sandwiches with gluten free options. Some of the best chili in town too. Always friendly!"}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood sandwich place!  Emerson East doesn't have too many restaurants quite yet and this is an amazing addition to the neighborhood.  Fast, quality ingredients with friendly faces...and a free cookie with meals!"}
{"text":"Really excellent sandwiches.  I had the spicy chicken panini and my wife had the turkey special on focaccia bread.  Both were well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  If you've never been before the menu can be a bit overwhelming, but I would guess that you really can't go wrong.  Prices are great and serving size is generous.  The interior eating area is a bit outdated and a little noisy.  It could use a few touches to make it cozy.  Overall though, we will be going back for some super tasty sandwiches!"}
{"text":"(Order 3/5/16) 
We ordered food at 4:45 pm. Two hours later, we had no food and called the restaurant several times. The restaurant told us that the delivery driver had left a few minutes ago and \"should be pulling up.\" 15 minutes after that, we called the restaurant again, who then had the driver (name: \"Roman\") call us. The driver lied and said he left the food 30 minutes ago after calling us twice. Problems with this: 1) we had no missed calls, and 2) his unfortunate lie does not match with the restaurant saying \"he'd just left.\" If the driver arrived \"30 minutes ago,\" then the restaurant would have said that he'd already arrived the first time we talked to them. Realizing he was caught in a lie, Roman The Driver(TM) started yelling at us on the phone, berated us for not being \"on top of it,\" and then said he was the manager as an excuse, which really only makes his behavior even more disgusting and appalling.

We're lucky that we ordered from GrubHub, and thus were able to get a refund through them. As I've seen from other reviews, those that ordered direct from the restaurant were not so lucky.

TLDR: 2 hour wait, no food, no refund from restaurant, lying driver with a temper"}
{"text":"Delicious. I had the California Chicken panini, it came with chicken, bacon, avocado,  pesto and cheese. The food came pretty quick and was one of the best sandwiches I've had around town."}
{"text":"We had Crostini Sandwiches catered in to work today. It was our first time trying them out. 

The sandwiches, we got an assortment of paninis, were a big hit! They were hot, fresh and delicious!! There was a pretty good selection as well. We ordered cookies and a salad as well. The cookies were warm when we got them - not sure if they were warm from coming out of the oven, or warm because they were packed in the box with the warm sandwiches, but it didn't really matter anyway. They were delicious and gobbled up quickly. The salad was a little wimpy, but then again it wasn't intended to be a meal salad with a ton of fancy stuff, it was a simple side salad, and it was just that: simple. The dressings that came with were very good! 

Everyone in the office really seemed to love the sandwiches, though, so we will definitely be ordering from them again!"}
