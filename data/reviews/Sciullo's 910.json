{"text":"Best breakfast in the area!!!! Also the man rueben is to die for. So good. The fries are delicious! Do not pass this place up!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic little Deli.  Famous for their Reuben.  The meat melts in your mouth.  The breakfast menu is fantastic; authentic Italian cheeses and bread.  Highly recommend, seating is limited."}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place for lunch. Omg, it was fantastic! It's not much to look at, but the food is so good. I got a hot turkey sandwich, he got Salisbury steak. Huge portions, I brought half of mine home for dinner. My friend ate all of his! Order at the counter, food is served at your table/at the bar. There's only maybe 6 tables inside, bar seating for 4. Friendly staff, definitely worth a stop. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great little gem. Best breakfast in the area. Friday night fish is off the charts. We've never had a bad meal."}

{"text":"This place is awesome. The serving sizes are very good. Service is good. The owner is very friendly. Their sandwiches are huge. The prices of all the food are very very reasonable. I must stop if you're visiting the Pittsburgh area. Only 20 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh my stop in and try and make sure you wear your Pittsburgh Steelers stuff"}
{"text":"Small unassuming restaurant / deli.  Chorizo scramble was great.  Semi - self service."}
{"text":"I LOVE Sciullo's! I eat lunch here almost once a week since it is near my office. If I could eat here every day, I would. That's how much I love it! 

Mark and Marci, the Chef/owners, and the other workers are all very welcoming and friendly and make super delicious food. They always make me and anyone else that goes there feel so welcome, like a big family! 

I usually will order a Cajun chicken salad and it is hands down so delicious. Chicken is always cooked perfectly and so juicy! Its not on the menu but Mark will always make it for me, and if I call in an order for pickup he knows exactly who it is for. 

ALWAYS try their soups. Homemade greatness that MUST be tried!! I will usually end up bringing home 1 or 2 quarts of the soup just because they are so good!

This is just one of those small family owned places that is not to be passed up. If you have a chance, please try here! Breakfast, lunch, dinner, to go, whatever it is, get yourself to Sciullo's!!"}
{"text":"Located off of 910 in gibsonia - the waitress was very accommodating with circumstances - allowing us to eat outside with 3 kids and a puppy.  They had a decent menu selection - I had a steak salad - which was actually more like sand which meat vs actual steak - wasn't a huge fan.  My Boyfriend and his kids all enjoyed their meals!  The kids ate chocolate chip pancakes which they loved!  Breakfast foods here seem to be a hit!  The kids were hesitant to use the bathroom here - apparently \"scary\" and small.   For what was needed today this fit exactly what we needed.  Right in the same plaza where we take the dog for puppy class!"}
{"text":"Best food ever! Get anything and you'll love it.  I'm particularly fond of the grilled cheese french toast and Parmesan garlic fries... All of it's to die for!  Prices are good for all you get!  This place is a gem don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"What a gem, what a find!

It's very easy to drive by this deli/restaurant as it is located in a strip mall with a very small sign and an unassuming facade.  Friends introduced me to this restaurant and I can't wait to go back.  Hands down some of the best home cooked style food I have had in a long time.

This is a family run business, Mr. Sciullo himself is behind the counter cooking and his wife helps/takes the orders.  The food is good--I had one of the best reubens I've ever had here.  I'm going to throw the gauntlet down and say this reuben is better than even Gullifty's AND Fatheads.  Why?  It had very high quality beef on it, and the ingredients were balanced.  Most places give you a 6\" thick layer of corned beef, huge glob of thousand island and then a clump our sauerkraut.  Everything was evenly matched w this reuben.  

I was emotional eating when we dined here so everything I got was unhealthy.  The fried pickles and mozzarella triangles are to die for.  Its fried food that is not greasy (but was deep fried!) and the batter is home made.  My friend had the Italian hoagie and was raving about it.  

The food here is not fancy and neither is the restaurant but the food is home made, made well, and fresh. They also cater and I would absolutely consider ordering from them for my next event.  I dont regularly have events but if I did...I'd get Sciullo's.

I hear their breakfasts are to die for and they are served all day..  

Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"The food is decent with a good menu, but the place is extremely dirty along with the workers. Should give Gordon Ramsey a call."}
{"text":"Dang is all I can say.. there hashes are in freeking credible.. must try if in the area.. one of the best breakfasts in the greater Pittsburgh area if not the best.  Service was fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"My aunt took me to this wonderful soup and sandwich shop yesterday. The staff recognized her and the owner was joking around with us. I ordered a soup mushroom (made from scratch yum) and a brisket half sandwich (also very tasty), she had soup and a half salad sandwich. She has been coming here for a fair bit of time says they are always great and she has enjoyed watching them make the soups over the counter. This is where you go grab a quick fix and they keep it moving for you services was amazing they can from behind the counter and took away our baskets without prompting and if you love the hole in the wall made fresh and simple then this place has got it. The kind of place your grandparents took you to when you where young! Going back this evening for fish and crab cakes there lent special!! 

update! 
Got the fish and crab cakes last night and they where very good. We ordered 4 fish dinners and 2 crab dinners on Friday during lint (note on these days and times call in orders ahead if your ordering to go). The fish thin fillet's fresh batter dipped and fried tasty. the crab cakes where large and full of crab very moist because these ones don't have much breading at all held together very well and taste was liked by all."}
{"text":"A co worker recommend this little deli spot. She said it was crazy good good - boy was she right! I had the fish in a dish with Mac and cheese and broccoli soup. Food was great! Be sure to not pass this little shop up."}
{"text":"We live near by and I had heard great things about Sciullo's.  I was not disappointed!  I had the Nutella Banana Pancakes and they were wonderful.  Two large sausage patties.  Prices were very reasonable.  This is a small place with only 5 tables.  The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that when we were there, only 3 tables including us were occupied yet it took about 15 - 20 minutes to get our food after we ordered.  I did note that there is only a small grill in a small cooking area so I am sure that is at least part of the reason.  But it will not keep us from visiting again, hopefully soon!!!!"}
{"text":"GIANT sammiches; everything fast and fresh; friendly staff; and, great prices! This spot is tucked away but definitely worth your time for brunch or lunch."}
