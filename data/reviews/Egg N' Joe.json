{"text":"Today was a very different experience than in the past. First, the restaurant did not seem as busy: it was 9:30 a.m. and there are usually people waiting for a table. That felt a little odd because a busy restaurant is a sign of good food and service. The service was fast, but one of our orders was wrong so they had to go back and fix it. Then when my order was finally ready, the hash browns and bacon were overcooked (almost burned in some spots) and looked old, like they had been sitting out a long time. We could also hear the people in the kitchen yelling at each other, which was not pleasant. This was not a good experience because the ambiance was low-energy and sad and the food was pretty bad."}
{"text":"First visit for me.  Excellent food, Justin is an awesome server, who offered great menu suggestions.  Pancakes are fantastic.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for lunch. The food was delicious .... our waiter Cory was polite and very very efficient! I will come again and make certain that I sit in his section !"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good breakfast spot. We have been here a few times now and the food was great every time. They let you change the dish around to your preference and the service is always great. They are really busy on weekends but you can call ahead and put your name on the list."}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall breakfast spot. Healthy items,  and not-so-healthy items, but everything is super yummy. Chorizo and egg tacos are my fav"}
{"text":"Very cute place! The food was delicious and the service was great. There was a bit of a wait, but they were kind enough to bring coffee outside for those waiting outdoors, which I thought was very thoughtful."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here for the first time for breakfast. We really enjoyed it! I got the fresh fruit waffle combo that was absolutely delicious!!! Our server Gus was so kind and attentive. We will definitely be coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Good little place for some good food. Came here out of the blue and have been back many times.  Biscuit and cravy is definitely worth the drive in."}
{"text":"Had the potato pancakes and the eggs Benedict - amazing!!  Just be warned - the wait starts usually around 9am on Saturday and Sunday."}
{"text":"I came in on a Saturday morning. It was obvious that the restaurant was quite busy but my food still came out hot and delicious.  Love the German pancake!"}
{"text":"Fun place, tasty food, Do it! You won't regret it..."}
{"text":"Not very impressive. The wait area is rather small, for a breakfast place, there should be a little bit more weight area. The waitstaff took way too long to come visit our table. The booth that we were seated at, had coffee and water carafes lining the seat back. I had to ask the waitress to move them so hot coffee didn't gets billed on our toddler. It's not like the seat back of the booth was designed for them. It's just purely where the waitstaff drop them off. Menu advertises items that are not homemade, that you would expect to be homemade. The juice is advertised as some random brand and biscuits are advertised as Pillsbury. With the reviews and the wait, I expected better. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great menu, quick to get seated despite crowd waiting, fast friendly service, great German pancake! Enjoyed a reasonably priced breakfast served fast with a smile. We were visiting from our of town and really enjoyed the meal. Go try it out!"}
{"text":"I'm giving them five stars--this breakfast/lunch restaurant just opened near our home four days ago so there are lots of kitchen kinks--only on the efficiency not on the quality of the amazing food!  Outstanding menu, fluffly omlettes (they have an option of a two egg rather than three-I will do that next time as this was a huge omlette).  Hash browns (just tasted as I don't tend to eat them and they were delish) and a biscuit that was so light it melted in your mouth.  I think this is a winner.  Give it a few weeks to get the new kitchen up to par as I know it will be because the food is excellent.  Great location!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and the service was good! I love that a lot of their menu items you can order as lighter fair in half portions."}
{"text":"They were \"out\" of German pancake batter when I visited, apparently it wasn't rising correctly so they weren't selling them. Given the typical recipe for puffed German pancakes (incredibly quick to beat up and make, with a longer than the normal restaurant meal bake time) this is *very* odd. (Are they using a mix?) (Is their oven down?) 

The iced tea refill tasted off, but the coffee was \"diner quality\" fine. I had a few cups.

My omelet was exactly as I expected it, reasonable diner or diner+ (think IHOP) quality food. Price was a little steep for the quality, but I did order one of the more expensive things on the menu.

While it was many hours before closing they had someone going to tables (both occupied and not) swapping out the sugar dish; this would usually be done after the customers leave or between customers, was rather odd to have a fellow sprawl across the other side of the booth, after asking if he could refill the sugar. 

Service was good - waitress seemed a little bit frazzled, but was friendly and kept beverages topped up very promptly (asking if I wanted more coffee) without me having to ask. One of the bussers asked if I wanted more coffee & filled up my cup after dropping off the dishes he was already carrying, I noticed the other wait staff working doing the same thing with their tables, keep up the good work! (This brought the scale up a star).

The restaurant is louder than normal, with lots of crashing dishes and kitchen noise. 

On the \"would I take visiting family members here\" scale: I would not."}
{"text":"All we can say is, \"wow!\"  Delicious food and fast, friendly service.  We got the crepes, potato pancakes, and crab benedict and it was all fantastic.  We've been to nearly all the high rated breakfast places in Chandler/Gilbert and this place is the BEST!  We finally found our new weekend breakfast place.  Also, Matt, our server, was excellent."}
{"text":"Sad to say the food is lousy--cold, hard biscuits and barely cooked hash browns.  Coffee is just ok.  Eggs were fresh, tho.  Nice patio with friendly service in convenient location, but we'd prefer to get a good meal."}
{"text":"I love trying new breakfast places and Egg N'Joe didn't disappoint. The cranberry mimosa was a very healthy pour, and the menu selection is great, it has nice variety of healthy choices along with all the great basics."}
{"text":"We were excited to try a new breakfast place in Gilbert but were quickly disappointed when we called on Sunday morning to find out that they only offer take out Monday thru Thursday."}
{"text":"The German Pancakes are the main reason to go here. They are fantastic! If you are a fan of crepes or pannekoeken then you'll most likely be a fan of this. Our wait was a bit long (but that tends to happen with a new place for Sunday brunch). Recommend going when it's less busy."}
{"text":"Great food. Always eat too much when I go here. Excellent omelettes, pancakes, French toast, etc. Wait is well worth it."}
{"text":"I wish we had the same great experience as everyone else. I was really hoping to enjoy a great meal with my husband and two children. We waited for over an hour for our food that never arrived. Our waitress told us our food will be up any second. 50 minutes later we were still waiting for our food and never saw our waitress until we got up and left because our 1 year old and 3 year old were hungry and getting restless. The management was oblivious to the time it was taking to get our food. Seems like their was no communication between managment and servers."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and service! Our server Cheryl has a great spirit and made us feel welcome! I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone!!!"}
{"text":"Waiter was nice but food is cheap and low quality. Order was also wrong but not really worth fixing."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. The wait is a long time. I could have made a better breakfast. A complete waste of money!!!!"}
{"text":"My food was really cold when it came out and had very little taste to it. The customer was pretty good however. I wouldn't come back nor would I recommend it to anyone. I was advised by a friend to try it but that friend doesn't like me I'm guessing."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! It is clean, new, and modern. The mountain views from the patio are beautiful. I am always greeted warmly and feel right at home. The service is great and the food is awesome. My favorite things so far are the veggie omelette topped with hollandaise and perfect hash browns, all of the crepes I've tried and the big German pancake! I'll keep coming back for more"}
{"text":"I've been to the Egg n Joe in Scottsdale and loved it so I was excited to see a new one open this week closer to my neighborhood. On our visit, the staff was warm and friendly, the service was great and the food was excellent. I had a yummy omelette topped with hollandaise, perfect hash browns and fruit. This new restaurant is a great addition to the neighborhood and I will definitely be back to try more things!"}
{"text":"I know it a new restaurant and things need to be work out, but...
I called to get menu faxed, never got it
Ordered 4 lunches, 1 was hamburger and 1 was prime rib dip. The dip was in a coffee cup and end up all over my back seat ( it wasn't sealed)
Both hot sandwiches were cold 
Please improve on your take out"}
{"text":"Checked in for either seating. Waited just 10 minutes. Hubby had eggs Benedict. I had the German pancake with maple-Carmel apple topping along with 2 eggs and bacon. Way too much food. We split the pancake. Still had some left over. Very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"This place has great crepes. It's hard to find places that get them right, or even have them to begin with. Good selection of other items as well. I've also had the \"Crabocado\" omlette. Pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Get there early on weekends.  Nice wait staff, they are very attentive .  I have had breakfast and lunch there and found the variety of menu options pretty good.  They have a nice kids menu with coloring books and crayons , which his nice to see when so many restaurants don't have anything for the kids . You can leave your iPad at home because kids will be occupied with coloring and games in their menus."}
{"text":"I agree with another review. This place is a lot like Denny's. They use frozen hash browns with no seasoning what so ever. The sausage links were not cooked all the way through even when asked to have them well done. The omelet had no flavor either. If the ham would of been cooked some it would of brought out some flavor. Plates looked nothing like the pictures on their web page. We paid $23 for two plates and one drink and got about $3 worth of food.  We will not be going back"}
{"text":"This place is a new gem in Gilbert!  It has a nice bright interior with a friendly staff, something I could see as I walked in.. We were there for breakfast and chose the Sun Devil skillet and a Classic German Pancake with apples. Both were meals were delicious. The German pancake is actually more like a huge crepe than an American style pancake. It was light and delicious. Our server's name was Ilona and she treated us like we were her only guests even though we could see she had several other tables and guests. She was so friendly and gracious but still fast and efficient with refills, a true professional. The service, food preparation, taste and overall experience was something other diners and restaurants could learn from. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Finally a breakfast place around here with a more unique selection than the standard breakfast places. German pancake was great as was the avocado Benedict. Good coffee and very attentive staff. Matt took good care of us, Aaron was friendly and the manager even came by to refill coffee and see how things were. They had a great kids menu that kept them busy and full!  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We wanted to try your new restaurant, however we were there at approximately 945am, to find 7 empty tables, cleared and table service available.  The patio was also empty except for one table.  There were probably 8 guest waiting to be seated.  Now I have worked in the food service business and the only time this happens is when you don't have enough wait staff.  Your hostess was also rude, probably due to your incompetences and she was taking all the heat.  It's too bad you let this happen as, it will kill a new restaurant wicker than anything.  Standing in line for 15 to 20 minutes for breakfast is unacceptable especially on a week day after the working folks have gone to work.  We won't be back for a second try."}
{"text":"Had a super yummy breakfast served by a really nice waitress with a real personality.  Her name is Debbie and she's great at her job.  When the food is great already, great service is a nice cherry on the top!  This makes dining out worth it!"}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like this place... A group of four of us came here for brunch on a Sunday.  We expected the 45 min wait to get a table, but didn't expect the 50 min it took to get our food.  Since they're so new, I imagine they're fine-tuning their system and this wait time will hopefully shrink.  And that isn't really worth a bad Yelp review.  Here is why I'm horrified by this new joint and don't plan to return:

CONS: I ordered an ice tea with lemon, and I noticed that our server retrieved the lemons from the outside service station. The lemons were warm and a little slimy, and out of habit, I used them anyway.  This was the WORST decision ever, but I didn't realize it yet (more on that later).  When our food came, I realized that my veggie omelet had a bunch of bacon in it.  I told our server, who's response was, \"Ok, I'll let the kitchen know.\" She didn't take the omelet back, comp anytime, apologize, offer something else on the menu, let a manager know... literally, nothing.  I'm Jewish, so eating a bacon omelet wasn't really an option (she obviously wouldn't know that, but you'd think that meat in a veggie omelet would be reason to take some action?).  Our server never refilled our water or drinks, despite the long wait and the empty glasses.  I wrote a note to management on the little \"Please Give Us Your Opinion\" card about the experience.  I never received an email or call... which isn't a good way to start off a new business.  Honestly, I wouldn't be writing this review it someone thought it'd be worth following-up with us. Oh well.  I didn't realize I actually got food poisoning until around six hours later. Brunch was the only meal I didn't share with a group that day, and no one else fell ill (definitely not a virus or anything contagious).  It was two days of severe illness, which probably took longer to resolve since I'm pregnant.  My doctor confirmed that it was food-related.  She thinks it was the lemons, but obviously this is just speculation.  I won't describe those two days, but it was BAD.  Lastly, we overheard a server ask a busser, \"Could you move that umbrella so it shades my table?  Hopefully the other table won't mind.\"  (We were on the patio.)  The busser said, \"Ok,\" and proceeded to move an umbrella away from two ladies who were dining together and used it to shade the requesting table.  The two ladies were definitely not OK with having the sun in their eyes and were polite but vocal about it. They requested another umbrella or that he move it back.  The busser said he'd ask, but he never came back.  No one offered to help the ladies, move them to another table...nothin'.  They left.  

PROS: The biscuits were awesome and hash browns were pretty good. The German pancake that we all split was pretty darn good, too."}
{"text":"First timers and enjoyed it very much. Would not recommend the crabacado omelet it tasted a bit fishy. Have never eaten anything with crab that tasted fishy. The hostess greets patrons by opening the door & usually seats them immediately. The eggs are cooked to your liking, hash browns are cooked with crispy brown bits & are not greasy, the biscuits are wonderful clouds of perfection. The biggest con in our experience, being seated at a table by the front door. On a windy, chilly day it did not work for us. The cold air uncomfortably blowing right on us each time the door opened. They accommodated us by moving us to a back booth only to find that the AC had been cranked up making us just as cold and our food went cold very quickly. We will go again. But think perhaps they should investigate a screen of some sort to protect those front tables and may-be get a handle on their AC."}
{"text":"This is our new favourite place for breakfast in north Scottsdale. The German pancakes are unique and really tasty."}
{"text":"The food here is good. I have been here multiple times. The two star is for the service from the front and they were probably directed from management. This is the second time I came to Egg n Joe's and received a wait time of 40 minutes. I asked the hostess about the 8 open tables outside and their response had something to do about keeping the servers load down. What!!!! I saw 3 plus families leave after that. Do you Egg n Joe's not like money or your servers. I am very disappointed."}
{"text":"Not sure where all the positive reviews came from... maybe it's the best option up north here.  The crepes were oily and overly sweet.   The chicken fried steak sandwich was made of low quality ingredients: american \"cheese\", disintegrating bun, wilted lettuce, and old & soft tomato. The steak not very good either.  Overall, this place reminded us of a Dennys or IHop."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  Not Elmer's but close.  Nice to see crab on the menu and Tillamook cheese."}
{"text":"Just an \"Average Joe\" breakfast place. No ala carte menu, Just a $10 + breakfast place. For the price, the serving size was quite small.  Has a diner like feel to it and the staff was friendly, but not worth the prices for average breakfast food."}
{"text":"What a treat!! Ilona was super sweet and friendly!! Food was fantastic def recommend the German pancake and eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"Horrible service, we went to this place for the first time, because all the great reviews, right from the beginning the waiter spilled the OJ all over the table, and that was just the beginning.... We ask for a omelette without advocates and it came with advocates, my wife them said it was ok she will eat with it, started eating and found a black hair in the middle of her food, ewwww,,,, my daughter strawberries crapes was cold and mush, we ask for a couple class of water and never got to the table, to finish all out our \"German Pancake\" came without to the table not complete, we complain again and the waiter told he chef forgot, it's was a horrible experience we all got out there still hungry and had to find a other place... So not recommend at all"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Have eaten here many times since they opened. Have always had breakfast but would think lunch would be great as well."}
{"text":"First time having a German Pancake! The over medium eggs and bacon that followed were perfect! Excellent service from Joseph and Aaron was so hardworking setting up the outside coffee station!  #eggnjoe #goodbacon #mynewplace #lingonberrybutter"}
{"text":"Great lil Joint!  We enjoyed this place! I had  the Ranch Breakfast - hash browns were nice & crispy and the bacon is FANTASTIC!! Deneen had a tortilla salad that was huge & Delish!  We will be back for sure - hoping they expand to Peoria/Glendale area!!"}
{"text":"Wouldnt even give a 1 star.  The place was pretty empty. We waited 10 min and then someone came to the front and said \"hold on a min\".  Finally got seated after 15 min wait.  Had to step over what looked like partial mopped up milk on floor. There were plenty of seating but she put us at the puddle.  Waitress came by. Asked what we would like to drink. We said our order and she said \"hold on, hold on let me get a paper as she fumbled thru her book.  This was not a young person and someone that should have been better prepared.  While waiting for our drinks dishes were being tossed around behind the wall.. not a pleasant eating environment at all!  We left without notice."}
{"text":"Loved the huge German pancakes here with the lingonberry butter!! I'd definitely go back in a heartbeat, wish we had in the south! Great variety of food for brunch & family."}
{"text":"Our first visit here.  My 10 yo  tried the Blender Strawberry Lemonade ($3.99)  and the Kid's Favorite: Cub Cake ($3.49).  The drink was not a smoothie but whipped, frothy concoction of lemonade and strawberry puree.  She loved it and it was big enough to where she didn't drink it all in the first two minutes.  I kept it simple and ordered the Famous Buttermilk Pancakes.  I didn't expect 4 of them, and they were delicious!!  Fluffy and tasty.  Since it came with two eggs and choice of pork sausage, chicken apple sausage or bacon, I stuck with traditional pork.  It was labeled as Zenner's, and had quite a unique flavor, but in a good way.  I think next time, since I know it doesn't taste like regular breakfast sausage and that's really what I was wanting, I want to try the chicken apple and keep the different flavors coming.  I'm taking two of the pancakes home for tomorrow morning for the kiddo.  At $9.49, it was a great value.  Kids menu offers a decent variety at decent prices, though that price only includes a milk or chocolate milk.  No other drink options are included in that price.  A great value for both quantity and quality!    (I did think $4 for the blender strawberry lemonade was a bit high though...maybe $2.99 for that one...there are no refills on it anyway.)
We will be back to try the German Pancake!  Next time we'll split as the servings were definitely good size...thankfully she doesn't mind...yet."}
{"text":"Amazing, clean and family friendly place. They have a large size portions and delicious food. The staff is very pleasant as well. Joe was our server and he was fenomenal! We will be back."}
{"text":"4 stars so far as i only had the yum german pancake. Service was excellent. Coffee good not great. Can't wait to go back and thru entire menu.  Need orange marmelade"}
{"text":"Been twice now. The food is very good and came out hot but it took an hour both times from arriving before we got our food, and just a simple fried egg breakfast that would be 15 minutes anywhere else. It was not that crowded so unfortunately they just do not have their kitchen working properly. If you are very relaxed and want to sip a bloody mary and chat for a while then you might fare better. I am quite relaxed and was still becoming quite frustrated by the time we got our meals and with no comment about how slow it was either time, it seems to be standard to them.

Additionally on our first visit, we were given the wrong food which was the most expensive item on the menu, a crab benedict. Rather than wait for a new meal after an hour wait we just took it and it was very good so no harm done, but rather than charge us for the original, non-mistake meal, they charged us for the more expensive one ($6 difference). if we declined it and waited for the correct meal, that one we ate would have gone in the garbage. I did not start a debate with the server, so that may have gone our way but just too many issues that I am not looking to deal with when I go out for an easy breakfast.  I'm afraid I will not be back."}
{"text":"Came on their first Saturday as a business, definitely nervous because they are new, but I was pleasantly surprised. Ordered the German Pancakes with lingonberry butter, and their stuffed hash browns (reminded me of a Latke). Two minutes from my house, definitely returning next weekend."}
{"text":"Meh. Slow service. Waiter: \" better late than never\". Mediocre food. Undercooked hash brown,eggs Benedict with very little hollandsise sauce."}
{"text":"Server \"Nikki\" provided outstanding service. It's nice to fine quality professional like Nikki. Great food great coffee. German pancake heaven."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast place with some interesting choices on the menu. Best thing we had was the kids French toast sticks. Kid you not. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with cinnamon and sugar. I don't even want to get into the caramel sauce that came with it. Dangerous."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. My first time here. Fresh clean bright atmosphere. My food was delicious. Ordered an omelette with no cheese it came with cheese. The waitress Cheryl have no problem returning it. And the chef Val came outwith my new order with no cheese . I would recommend this restaurant to everyone. Thank you Cheryl and Val I will be back!."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with my husband. First time here. This place was PACKED! I ordered an avocado Benedict, if was good but I felt like the price range is a little high for brunch. Service was also a little slow (possibly because it's a new place and traffic is high). Overall, food was good!"}
{"text":"Devon provided great service! Selection and quality of food was excellent! Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"My sister and I love to go out for breakfast. We found this place and it was delicious.  The portions were just right. The service was excellent. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff which does not turnover makes Joes an enjoyable place for people that enjoy eating out frequently. Newcomers will find a unique menu item in their German style pancake.  Allow a little extra time but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place! It is ALWAYS busy so plan on a wait if you go. We had great service and food, we will go back"}
{"text":"I love breakfast and a new place sounded exciting....unfortunately this place doesn't cut it. I feel for my neighborhood this place doesn't stand out and is below the quality is expect. My first visit the server wreaked of cigarette smoke, that right there almost made me walk right back out the door! Menu nothing outstanding, ambiance feels like a Little Denny's..., kids food came out cold, frozen hash browns. Just didn't stand up or out. I will not return and will stay true to the other local breakfast places in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"The place was packed with people, we were greeted and seated right away. Brought drinks right away, REALLY good diner coffee!! 

The portions weren't huge, but they shouldn't be. Its breakfast...not a pig feed. The food was fantastic, the chorizo was some of the best I've ever had!! Skillet came with a fresh biscuit instead of toast which was a nice surprise.  

The service was great, the place was clean, the food was fantastic. What more could you want in a place?"}
{"text":"Awesome service, great food, the restaurant is kept spotlessly clean. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices.
A great addition to the area."}
{"text":"Excellent service and delicious food! Our fav breakfast & lunch place in the North Valley!"}
{"text":"Great menu... Food was as tasty as it looked like it would be in the pictures.  Wait staff was great and the Kitchen Manager made the rounds to make sure everyone was happy.  We will be back."}
{"text":"all i can say is Michelle is the greatest!!!!! the service was steller the was great, however i would look into another process for cooking bacon, plated bacon drips with grease!!! not good every other aspect is fine, again i must mention Michelle again her constant smile and williness to make my stay pleasant is why i continue to have my breakfast at this market street location."}
{"text":"Our first time here and we were expecting a great breakfast, but for the cost, were underwhelmed. Still good, but not 5 stars. Service was excellent, the chicken apple sausage was interesting, but at the end of the day, there are lots of breakfast places that are better for less money."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast here this morning with my husband. No wait we were seated right away.  The service was excellent.  And the food outstanding.  We had the crab Benedict, French toast and the Works hash browns all were delicious.  The hash browns were done nice and crispy no grease.  Perfection."}
{"text":"This place is not good. I don't know how they got good reviews or why anyone would wait to eat here. The food was not fresh and the service was slow. The salsa tasted like it was straight out of the Picante jar. Fresh fruit shouldn't taste like it's been sitting in processed syrup for a week. Orange juice taste like sunny delight. The restaurant looks nice but they put no effort into making fresh food. Everything tasted frozen and processed. Head across the street to JJ's deli for real food done right."}
{"text":"Let's keep it simple here:

Decor = IHOP+
Menu = Denny's
Food = Denny's cleverly disguised as better
Service = My waiter was just plain bizarre and spoke in a creepy, inappropriate aristocratic way so what he did as a waiter didn't matter. His waiter skills are too overshadowed by his personality disorder. I am sure there are other fine wait staff there.
Price = IHOP+"}
{"text":"We have been coming to Egg N Joes since it's opening last year. Great food and friendly service."}
{"text":"Took our family here for brunch. It's just average, even a bit below. They charge for refills on lemonade (really?), so my 14 yr old had $10 worth of lemonade. We ordered breakfast items and lunch items-- food was luke warm. Will not return."}
{"text":"Save your money and go elsewhere. I ordered a turkey sandwich with Dijon mustard. It came with mayo so I sent it back. After the rest of the table was almost finished their meals, they finally came back with another sandwich. When I started to eat it, I realized that it tasted mostly like bread. I looked and found that there was one single slice of turkey. Eventually the manager came by and asked what happened. She went into the kitchen and came back and told me that the sandwich should have had 4oz of Turkey and mine only had 2oz of turkey. She explained that the kitchen misunderstood the portions. She thanked me so that the next person would not get short changed. The food is nothing special. The rest of my party agreed. The way they handled a bad situation was pathetic. I will never return."}

Again a great experience! At first it seemed like we had no waitress and later found out we were at tables that are outside the norm! I have to give a big shoutout to Kellie!! She took ownership of our table and gave us the greatest service!! She is the reason why I keep going to places that give great service!! Kellie you need to be the owner of this place!!! The food again was great!! I'm stuck on the Crabacado omelet!!!! Yummmy!!!


This place is great!! I had the Crabacado Omelette!! That's right a crab meat omelette!! I thought it would be a little strange but this was definately in the top 3 omelettes I have ever eaten! If you are a crab fan this is for you! I ordered it with the sauce on the side and drizzled it on to my liking!!! Julie our server was very friendly and gave great service! Definitely going to visit this place again!!!

{"text":"Great food, great service, yummy Eggs Benedict, delicious Sun Devil Skillet, awesome pancakes - we will be regulars!!!"}
{"text":"I have visited Egg & Joe's a few times and while my 9 yr old grand daughter was in town we would try it again. We ordered crepes & biscuits w/ gravy w/ eggs. Service was good and the atmosphere pleasant and bright. The reason for the 3 stars is value. 
2 biscuits with a small ladle of gravy and my wife asked the price on an extra crepe, 
$4.59 when the order of 3 cost 10.49. 
After tip breakfast for 3 was over $60. 
Atmosphere wasn't worth the additional,
Best to have breakfast at home in the future."}
{"text":"We went to Egg n' Joe for the first time yesterday where we had a nice breakfast.  I had a ham & cheese omelet while my wife had a waffle.  The menu shows that the waffle comes with eggs but she asked to only get the waffle and when the bill came the price was reduced to reflect the no eggs.  She said it was very good.  My omelet was good and the hash browns and biscuit that came with it were also tasty.  Our waiter was Gus who did an excellent job from start to finish.  The atmosphere is pleasant, not super noisy which is appreciated.  

Overall, Egg n' Joe is a nice neighborhood restaurant that we will come back to again."}

{"text":"Gross food. Everything people say about the wait is true. Bad service. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow! This place lack the critical timing needed to to run a restaurant. Just to get seated the wait time is ridiculous. They have no water or juice to drink while you wait. There is nowhere to sit during 60+ minute waits. Come back in 6 months and see if they fixed the problem."}
{"text":"Great food for a good price with awesome service.  The waitstaff is the friendliest in town.  Clean too.  It's a new place so pretty busy at peak times."}
{"text":"Amazing service and outstanding food! Me and my family came on a Sunday morning and the place was packed but the wait was only 20 minutes which just shows how prompt the staff is. Very good serving sizes and great price for what you get! Awesome new place to eat in Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"First visit to Egg N' Joe this morning, and it was a great experience. Though I had to wait a bit for a table (usually a good sign), it wasn't very long at all. 

I was pleased right away with the pleasant staff, and my waitress (Tis) was GREAT!  Very helpful with her explanations, and she stayed on top of things with a smile the whole time I was there. 

I thought I would try the German pancake (strawberry) I have heard so much about from fellow Yelpers, and was not disappointed!  

I will definitely be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Tried this new location at was disappointing 
Experience. When you order a cheddar omelet you expect cheese on it. Not here..
Slow service and when we made point of orders wrong took another 15 minutes for them to decide what to do.  Lot of miss steps don't recommend."}
{"text":"Can in on a Sunday morning with a party of 11 and they got us in quick and the food and service is AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. Only place I have found outside of Washington with Dungeness crab eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"Good food and our waitress Kellie was awesome.  Mimosa's were pretty good. My husband had the Sun Devil skillet.  Was excellent!  We will return again!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Got a complimentary German pancake and it was delicious and out of this world. Service was A+. They forgot to bring in an order for one of us (another German pancake) but gave us a free entree coupon to use next time as soon as they found out. We didn't want the order anymore as we were already full. Servings are big. They were very apologetic and very nice. Will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"We love the food at Egg N' Joe.  It's delicious!   Our favorites include the French toast, cinnamon swirl pancakes, and the valley of the sun.  The place is very popular so there could be a line- we try to go on Saturday afternoons around 1 or 2 after everyone has eaten.  The service is great and they are very friendly."}
{"text":"I never actually tried this place, however i feel like they deserve 5 stars because of their clever name. Good job!!"}
{"text":"great food but wont be back 
our service was less to be desire.  10 min after we sat down we had a drink order taken.  25 minutes later she decided to take our order.  it was funny watch people sit down after us get drinks, food and bill before we saw a piece of toast.   
best part was the manager was to busy sitting at a table talking with some of her friends verse helping out the staff that needed it"}
{"text":"We love egg and Joe! My son loves the grilled cheese and had two orders of it! Our server Kelly was excellent."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Awesome service, great food and always super fast! The mimosas are the best! This is my new favorite breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here about 20 times as a get to go food on the semi-regular. I order the same thing- Valley of the Sun Omelet with a biscuit. The staff is always really cool and excited you are a customer. The food is always top level but I though I would comment today as the biscuit I had was amazing. The precision of the cooking for the biscuit with the perfect airiness and texture could have won a prize. Thank You Egg N' Joe - you made my day."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go here because I'm not much into chain restaurants, but I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. I had the crabavo omelet which was delicious! The atmosphere was very \"chain-like\" but the food more than made up for it! Definitely would come back again!"}
{"text":"The German pancakes were delicious, light and fluffy. Great atmosphere and service. Shelly our server, was was very attentive to our table and offered so great suggestions. If you have to wait for a table, they also offer complimentary coffee and water outside."}
{"text":"Great breakfast / brunch place up north Scottsdale! Will definitely try this place again, maybe for lunch. Recommend checking it out!

Two of us went for brunch on a Saturday.  Called at 10:15ish to see what the wait was and we gave our name to the hostess who answered, told her we'd be there in about 20 minutes.

When we arrived (on time as we said we would), the parking lot was full, but we still found a stall as soon as we drove thru. There was a good amount of people waiting outside.  We checked in with the hostess desk, was given a pager, went outside to wait & not a minute after we sat on a bench outside, our pager went off.  (We loved that we could put our name on their list when we called!)

Got seated & greeted quickly.  Our waitress was friendly and attentive, even though the place was jammin'.

Didn't have to wait long for our food and it was yummy!  Although, I don't think they're known for their coffee...just sayin'... but we are kinda coffee snobs.

Definitely recommend! And will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful!  I had the German Pancake with strawberries and it was delicious.  The pancake covered the whole plate."}
{"text":"Had the chorizo skillet breakfast. Very flavorful and good! My husband and I shared it, plenty of food. The first clue  it was good it was a packed parking lot. The restaurant was full but service was fast."}
{"text":"Everything started at $10.  Busy place but seated within 10 minutes.   In Costco mall. German baked pancake very good but more like a crepe.  Good sausage but salty ham. Coffee is 2.59. Great pancakes."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast with amazing service. Our bill for 5 was $77. Not cheap but lots of food that was well prepared and Ariana our waitress was the best."}
{"text":"Good breakfast food. A little wait but worth it. Definitely going to come back to try the pancakes."}
{"text":"Our server was great though we didn't see him again after our orders were delivered. Two orders of Eggs Benedict, one order had perfectly poached eggs the other the eggs were poached hard, no runny yolk. We wanted to send that order back but the lady said no. Had our server checked on us perhaps that would have been rectified. I ordered an omelet, it was okay though I prefer one prepared in a frying pan not spread out on the flat top and folded over itself which results in rubbery texture. The filling was avocado, bacon and onion. I think they used a half of yellow onion, too much!  Place was busy so likely a popular spot. Clean and bright is a plus. Coffee was okay but not great."}
{"text":"Called to place a pickup order and requested an item (Farmer's Market Skillet) listed on the online menu. Was rudely told they did not have that skillet, they had the other two skillets listed online and a veggie skillet. I casually mentioned that the veggie skillet must be the same as the Farmer's Market and I would like to order it. Representative continued to speak rudely to me, so I just said nevermind and hung up."}
{"text":"Came to have breakfast here on a Saturday morning. Walked right and was seated surprisingly. I then realized that it was because it was 7:30am because after 8 there was a ton of people waiting for a table.  I ordered the German Pancake and it was very good. I normally am a creature of habit and stick to what I know is good but on this day I was feeling a bit adventurous and decided to try it since I didn't know what to expect. I really liked that it was not overly sweet and and that it came with lemon wedges. It was a nice compliment to the powdered sugar. If a pancake and a crepe had a baby it would be a German Pancake because it tasted like a combination of both. I enjoyed it and would order it again. I docked one star because I also ordered coffee and didn't like the taste."}
{"text":"I really liked this place! I got the crab Benedict and it was delicious. My fiancé got a chicken fried steak (or something) dish and he really liked it also. Service was one of the fastest and best I've had at a breakfast spot. Nikki was great! She brought refills before our drinks were empty ( I usually don't have that luxury at other breakfast places for some reason). We will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"This place on Market St is good although it does not merit the cost per person or the wait times on a Saturday or Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Loveeee this breakfast place !!!! It's far from me but everytime i make it over there it's amazing!!! Food is awesome and coffee is some of the best i ever had."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite breakfast spot in the valley. It's hard to make that determination after just one visit, but I was super impressed by the entire experience. They were busy, but we were still seated immediately. Our server was kind and very attentive. The food comes in great portion sizes, and the price was right. And the most important thing? The food was DELICIOUS! My wife got the German pancakes combo, and I got the valley of the sun omelet. The omelet was fluffy and the salsa on top added great flavor. My wife raved about her pancakes. Our kids were happy with their pancakes, too. We will definitely be back for another visit."}
{"text":"Very quick response from management. Will try again. We'll see. Food was good, server was good. Just reception was bad. Will try again and report. Management seems to get it."}
{"text":"Once again they disappoint. No pickup on fri-sun. What kind of restaurant does that??? I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"First time visit. They have only been open a couple of weeks or so but everything seems to be working for them.  A wide selection for breakfast and we we're not disappointed by our choices such as the chicken fried steak breakfast and the German pancake combo, both were excellent. We will definitely be back. Our visit was on a Tuesday morning and the place got busy real fast."}
{"text":"My husband and I try this place for the first time. We will return the food was tasty not grease. the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Took the family here this morning. Great service and food!  I got the crabacado omelet which was really good. It is something I wouldn't normally order but wanted to try something different and I'm glad I did.  My husband enjoyed the country fried steak.  My daughter loved the cub cake pancake. She said it was \"amazing\" and she ate everything on her plate which is rare for her.  My son also enjoyed his kids big foot breakfast as well. We also loved their hot and freshly brewed coffee and their hashbrowns and biscuits were tasty. We will be back soon!!  Excited for this new breakfast (and lunch) restaurant in our area."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and no complaints! My friend and I both enjoyed our meals and will be back! I recommend the German pancakes. It is very busy (no shock there it's yummy) so be prepared to be patient. Still worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome place, great service, great food. Loved Debbie, try to get her as a server, but the whole atmosphere was friendly!"}
{"text":"Decent breakfast place, clean & new.  The food is pretty good I wouldn't say I was blown away by anything; The French toast I had with strawberries was yummy however my daughter did not like the chicken sandwich or the fish and chips.  It can get busy on the weekends and wait times are there."}
{"text":"We ate there last week, service was great for just opening and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"Well worth the wait! Coffee is great, bacon is to die for, portion sizes are large, price is good. Even in the busiest times the servers did a great job."}
{"text":"Egg N' Joe is a great alternative to Snooze.  While Snooze rings in 9.5/10 for food quality, Egg N' Joe delivers a solid 9/10 for food quality without the long wait times of Snooze and at a comparable price (admittedly higher than normal for breakfast/brunch).

Egg N' Joe wins over Snooze in service.  While both restaurants excel at service, you get a more personal feel at Egg N' Joe that makes all the difference.

The kids menu is a great added touch.  It's affordable and is presented as an activity book complete with crayons.

If you're in Gilbert and looking for breakfast or brunch, Egg N' Joe is the #1 spot."}
{"text":"It is an absolute mystery to me why this restaurant averages 4 stars. The wait was very long and the food subpar. Don't bother. 

We came to celebrate my husband and I's birthdays with family on a Saturday late morning. We waited 45 minutes for a table, which is not unexpected. But when we got sat, the service as extremely slow and not friendly. I asked for more water once and the waitress acted like I had been badgering her and wasn't being patient. 

The food was below average. I have had a better meal at Denny's with better service. I had the Dungeness crab blt salad. It's true that there is real crab on it, but that is the only special thing about it. It says it's served over greens, but no green was to be found on the bed of bagged iceberg lettuce. Nothing was home made and the servings pretty small. My husband had the biscuit and gravy plate with eggs. My oldest son had the traditional eggs Benedict and my youngest the kids waffle. We won't be going again."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly, the ambiance is light, bright and cheerful, the hollandaise sauce for eggs benedict top notch! Didn't like the english muffin being grilled instead of toasted since that just adds to the fat content.  I only gave a 3 because there are no healthy breakfast options other than oatmeal. I love breakfast and look for an eggwhite option or two which also include imagination with ingredients. 
I'd love them to be successful since they are just a hop skip and a jump from our house and we eat breakfast out frequently!"}
{"text":"Great food! Be prepared to wait if you go on a Sunday. German pancake is huge! Love the eggs benedict with avocado."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out, but I was a bit disappointed. I felt like there wasn't enough selections to choose from. Each section only had a few options. It always seemed like there wasn't much breakfast options... at least in my opinion. 

I ended up ordering the Sun Devil skillet because that was the only thing that seemed appealing. It was very flavorful! The potato hash tasted a little burnt, but other than that it was good. 

As for our service, it was very slow. I asked our waitress for a refill on my water and instead, she came to our table maybe 5 minutes later to refill coffee for my parents and left to attend to other tables. I had to ask again for her to refill my water. She was very apologetic about it, which I always appreciate."}
{"text":"We arrived and were told it would be a 30 minute wait which was not a problem.  They seated other people then started seating people that arrived.  My husband checked with the hostess and she scratched our name off without calling us.  We were willing to overlook this.  We were finally seated and waited over 10 minutes before anyone approached to see if we wanted coffee, water etc..  Our waiter took our order and we waited over 30 minutes to get out food.  We asked for more coffee and were served COLD coffee.  We saw our waiter a total of three times, the last was to drop the check on the table.

We will not go back for some time.  They need to work out a lot of kinks in their service and speed getting food out of the kitchen.  There are many other places we can go for breakfast where we can get good food and much quicker service.  I would not recommend this place to anyone right now."}
{"text":"Ive always called these Dutch Babies and served with fruit, the German version is yummy! Ice cold and generous mimosas! Big thumbs up"}
{"text":"Just average for 1st time visit. French Toast had great flavor, but the middle of two pieces were still gooey and very undercooked. The Denver omelet had very little ham and lots of red/green peppers cooked perfectly though. Service a little lack-luster, waited for coffee for a bit and used plates left on table. Overall not bad, but we have other places we'd still prefer to go to."}
{"text":"This place was delicious and the service was top notch. The side dishes from the kids menu were perfect for my picky daughter."}
{"text":"Came here around 9 on a Sunday and only had to wait about 10 minutes. I got the German pancake (huge and delicious), my 2 year old got the teddy bear pancakes (adorable), and my husband got an omelette. All of the food was great and our sever was very friendly and helpful. Good place to take our kiddo. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place for breakfast!  The servers are always friendly and the food is incredibly yummy.  My favorite is the Springtime Benedict which shows up as a seasonal item on the menu.  I hope they don't remove it because I literally order it almost every single weekend."}
{"text":"This was our first visit but we will definitely be back. The food was fantastic and the staff are great. What else could we look for. I had the German pancake and my wife had the chorizo and eggs skillet and loved it. There was so much we're taking half home. Awesome restaurant."}
{"text":"I found the food average. I wouldn't say it is anything better than Denny's or IHOP. However, the wait was out of control. There are very few places worth waiting 45 minutes on a HOT Arizona summer morning."}
{"text":"Mediocrity at its best.  Potential but it needs more work, bland food,never asked for a refill or checked up on during our meal.  We waited for a while to finally come to this place and was excited to try.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"It was my first time there and it was really good. I had the crab egg Benedict with hash browns. I don't know what bread they use but I am in love with the bread they use. It makes the egg benedict way better. The price was close to $14 little pricey but it comes with two so it's definitely fulfilling. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ok, it's good but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Had the Valley of the Sun omelette and there was plenty to eat but thank goodness for the salsa because it would be rather ho-hum. Waitstaff really nice but I wish they would have offered coffee refills. I shouldn't have to request it. If I was in the neighborhood then I'd stop but I think I'll stick with my usual breakfast place."}
{"text":"Holy satisfaction. By far the best breakfast in the valley that we have had so far. Coffee hot and strong. We had the Crabacado omelet that was to die for. Real Dungeness crab and the freshest avocado you ever saw all topped off with a fantastic hollandaise. All food fresh and tasty. I highly recommend Egg N' Joe. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything was great. I had the vegetable omelette with pancakes. Service was great. Clean restaurant and good coffee. I'll be back when returning to the area"}
{"text":"The wait for this location to open up was well worth it. I came in yesterday with my wife and I ordered the traditional French toast and she ordered the maple bacon pancakes; French toast was fluffy and the pancakes were cooked to perfection. Our server was Gus and he did a great job at making sure all of our needs were well taken care of as well as anticipating anything we needed before we even had to ask. It's a nice environment with friendly staff, this is our new go-to breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast food, the pork apple sausage is amazing, as are the pancakes , thick cut bacon was awesome, service is fast and friendly, and three of us including one pregnant woman  ate  WELL for $40.00."}
{"text":"Simply put this was amazing. The staff, their service and the food was excellent. Montana boy down there for 4 days and I didn't even look for another place for breakfast. The coffee was the best. Dark and full bodied but not bitter. How soon will you build in Montana??"}
{"text":"Super average place.  The service is nice.  But the food and atmosphere is very mediocre"}
{"text":"Cheryl was amazing and the German pancake was delicious!!! My first time here and I really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"Food good. 3 stars because of the service, which was too slow. They are a busy breakfast restaurant, but that shouldn't excuse the slow service. Other breakfast restaurants much more efficient. I apologize for negative review, just trying to be constructive."}
{"text":"We arrived at Egg n Joe thinking there would be a wait since it was newly opened.  There were friendly faces at the desk. We were seated right away, in fact there were about 12 tables open so they were not over whelmed with customers.  

Upon being seated, a waitress came out and gave us a menu and asked what we wanted to drink.  We took about 5-10 minutes to look over the menu since it was all new to us.  We ended up getting Fried Eggs and a Breakfast Skillet.  She came back and took our order.

We were busy talking,  the waitress came out and said our food would be out shortly.  She turned and left.  My husband looked at his watch and said she took our order 25 minutes ago!!  I did not realize time had passed that quickly.  There was a manager walking around the entire time we were waiting for our food asking tables about their visit there.  No, she never did approach us but you would think she would seeing us sitting there all that time with no food!  She never did come near our table for us to say something.  I started watching other tables that had been seated after us and they already had their food!!!  10 minutes after the waitress told us our food would be out shortly,  it came.  That was a 35 minute wait for our order so that tells us she forgot to place it!!  No apologies or concerns were acknowledged to us. 

The food was good, nothing to shout about  since I have eaten better but the service was terrible, no apologies for the late arrival of food  and they were not even busy.  When tables start getting their food before you and they were seated after you something is wrong!!  

I would not recommend this place to my friends, don't want them to have a bad experience also.  Not a positive experience our first time so we will think twice before we go back.  I believe our waitress was Jamie so if we do go back we surely don't want her waiting on our table.  She received a small tip, that is what she was worth!  

There are much better places in Scottsdale and Cave Creek to eat breakfast at,  so we will think twice about coming back to Egg n Joe.  We do not want to waste our valuable time waiting on our order."}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday morning to grab a bite to eat and grab some menus to share with my residents... sadly I was ignored by the supervisor herself. I generally would not leave a review without experiencing the service and food, however when an older couple walked in behind me, after me waiting a good 5 minutes, they were greeted and seated promptly. Working in property management I could have easily done some major free advertising."}
{"text":"Food was delicious and service was very quick. The German pancake was outstanding! We can't wait to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite Saturday morning breakfast haunts. Angela G is phenomenal, recommended a grapefruit juice mimosa, had to have 2 each! Every suggestion she makes, do it! All those little secret adds to meals make this a great experience every time."}
{"text":"Delicious It's a really busy place and we had to wait about 10 minutes but it was worth it!  I had bacon, ham,& scrambled eggs wrapped in crepes with hollandaise sauce & it was really good!  Lots of meat!  My husband got the Crabacado omelet....really tasty!  Lunch looked good too!  We shall return!!"}
{"text":"If I were looking for a regular breakfast place & was in the area, I would stop by Egg N' Joe. We went on a Saturday morning and it was packed. The wait was about 45 minutes but we had already driven out to Gilbert so we figured we would wait.

I had seen servers bringing out the Dutch Pancake & I had never had one before, so I decided to try one out with the Lingonberry Butter. My husband got the Clubhouse Omelette. As others have described it, the Dutch Pancake was like a cross between a crepe & pancake; I thought it was just okay. The Lingonberry Butter though was definitely a no for me since it was really tart. I may have actually liked the Dutch Pancake better if the butter was not on it. My husband's dish was well-prepared, nothing to write home about but large & filling.

The service was good, especially considering how busy it was. It didn't seem like there was a whole lot of seating inside, but they did have seating outside so maybe when the weather is nicer the wait won't be as long. Overall, as mentioned, the food was fine, no complaints, but this place just didn't make it on the top of my list of places to return to."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  But too expensive   For more than a once a week treat.  In laws loved it too.  Love the full size coffee mugs.  Home style feel"}
{"text":"The food is alright, the service is terrible. Waited 30 minutes just to get our checks and  food was not cooked all the way"}
{"text":"We have been here several times and the service and food is always great. We only go on week days and it is usually busy. We have never waited more than 15 minutes to be seated though. The meats are all good. The chorizo could be spicer though. German pancake is huge and is excellent! My wife had the potato pancakes and lived them too. Hash browns are freshly grated and regular pancakes are my favorite. We highly recommend this establishment."}
{"text":"Very clean and great staff.The food is good.But can't believe they have no tuna sandwich on the menu.L"}
{"text":"First time here and enjoyed the food and service was great.  I had the Farmers omelet and didn't want the extra carbs with bread or biscuit so the waitress suggested a fruit substitute.  Not a fussy coffee person as long as it's fresh and there's was fresh, hot and plentiful."}
{"text":"Breakfast is not my favorite meal of the day, but I could get on board after eating at Egg N' Joe.  I had the potato pancakes which were crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, and mixed with bacon, cheese, and chives - oh my! Hubby had the French Toast with the triple berry topping and a side of eggs and bacon...perfectly crisp bacon.  Oh and I thought their coffee was really, really good. Not too strong...just the way I like it!  The restaurant was crazy busy, but everyone was super nice and I look forward to going back in the near future."}
{"text":"Reliable favorite for breakfast! Never disappointed!my wife & I have been here on more than one occasion in the past three months.  On each visit, we've found the breakfasts (usually eggs Benedict) to be tasty, hot, and filling.  Service is prompt & thorough & the price is reasonable! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I took a friend to come have brunch with me and once we got inside we were greeted with a friendly welcome. Took a name and the wait was 30 mins. There was coffee for refreshments outside and a few chairs to sit on to wait. Once the buzzer detector buzzed we were sat right away to our table.

My friend ordered the Breakfast menu that had hashbrowns, sausage, ham, scrambled eggs, bacon, and buscuit. And I ordered the German Pancake - Caramel Apple. Of course we asked for a kids menu while we waited for our food.

There was a problem with my order so the manager told the waiter if I wanted something else to order but I only came here for the German Pancake so I wanted to wait for it. And when it came it sure was delish!

The service was good and when we got to pay our bill, it was cut off 50% due to the messed up order that my friend specifically wanted on her plate instead of what she got. The waiter apologized but I said it was ok.

I would still come back. Thank you for serving us Devin. (I don't know how to spell his name) but thank you."}
{"text":"Tried for the 1st time today.  Food was awesome but what set it apart was the great service.  The place was packed but our server constantly came over to refill drinks and ask if we needed anything.  She made us feel like we were the only ones in the place.
Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Super-consistent, delicious breakfast. Everything we've ordered has been fresh and yummy, and service is friendly and efficient. They do a big business in what they call a \"German pancake\" -- if you cook, you'll know it as a Dutch Baby -- but I judge any breakfast place by Eggs Benedict, and this place delivers.

Tip: in season and on weekends, arrive early (by 8 a.m.) because this place does a big business!"}
{"text":"My husband & I tried Egg N' Joe for the first time. Friendly service, delicious food, and good -sized portions. We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is well worth the wait!! Came for brunch on a Sunday mid morning. The service was exceptional, the atmosphere is great, and the food was DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"This was the 4th time  I have eaten here - the food is always good, there wasn't a long wait maybe because it was around 10:30. The restaurant was not busy but the servers were so unfriendly! The first time I went we had an amazing server but every other time the servers have been so rude and look miserable. It makes the dining experience awkward for sure !!!"}
{"text":"Really good come here a few times a week at least I love the eggs Benny with avocado and tomato the waffles are great too!"}
{"text":"So I went with my girls to this restaurant and we have had the best time ever!!  Food is super delicious!! But Tara, our server, just totally amazing!! Allowed us to make the little changes to fit our appetite!! Pls ask for her when there!! She works 6 days a week!! Ethan, restaurant manager, was very sweet and perfect for the job!! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Friendly service and great for kids.  They have a nice children's menu with pictures of food items for kids.  The pictures actually look pretty much exactly like the actual food, which is surprising.  Portion size is nice and there's different table configurations which works for larger families.  Have only been there for breakfast.  Bagel eggs Benedict is a nice twist on the original,  but the bagel needs to be a bit more \"authentic\" style bagel, too doughy.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Ugh, horrible choice for breakfast! 

I really don't understand the occasional \"great reviews\" other than a fluke occurance, I guess?! Especially where some of those reviewers will say basically that the food was so-so, the service wasn't good and the place wasn't clean -- then they leave a 4-star rating??!!

So, ok, upon arriving for breakfast (Sunday morning), there was no wait -- not really a good sign, but always a bonus to be seated early. The Hostess who never cracked a smile was wearing a Chicago Bears football jersey. As we walked to the both, I made small talk by asking her if The Bears were playing today? She looked at me as if I asked her to solve a quantum physics equation and coldly answered, \"Oh, uh.....I don't know. I just wear the shirt\" - classic.

After the mistake of going there, I make another mistake by ordering the \"veggie sandwich\" (no, I'm not vegan, just wanted something healthy). What came out was a sandwich that looked (and tasted) like a 7th grade Home Eco. student put together! The onions were raw chunks that fell out as I was eating it, along with pieces of spinach.

My wife had the crepes (without bacon) and when they arrived at the table it looked like they were empty!! I jokingly told her they were flat enough to fit in an envelope and mail out to someone! I regret not taking and posting a picture. I told her to open them up and inside we saw there were 3 leaves of spinach along with about 1/2 teaspoon of shredded cheddar -- that's it!! No wonder they were so flat!!

Coffee (which by the was is IN THE NAME OF THE RESTAURANT), was ok at best. Hint: when it's in the name it HAS to be really good, dammit!! The service was sporatic and they were not busy at the 10am hour we arrived. 

Other lowlights include: the whole time we were there we could hear the chef/owner yelling at her employees, which wouldn't bother me if it got results, but with all that effort and the food coming out of the kitchen, it was all wasted effort. Also, the floors looked sticky and had straw wrappers here and there even though they had someone sweeping the floors the ENTIRE time we were there!!

The ONLY bright part of the meal was the clam chowder, but based on some other reviews, I'm guessing it came out of a can.

The last kick in the teeth was the bill that came to just over $30!! (Again, for just 2 people). Are you kidding?? Well, that's what I get for trying a new spot before reading reviews or checking in with friends. Afterwards, I called to \"warn\" a friend about that place and he chewed MY ear off telling me how they won't go back after their first visit. 

Great, talking to him first would have saved me the time and money. Don't make the same mistake: YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!"}
{"text":"Everything in the menu is great...my only complaint is each time I've gone in there's always a wait to get in and the patio seating is not set up for a good dining experience especially with summer coming."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had brunch there this morning, not knowing what to expect since they just opened this Monday.  \"Well oiled machine\" as servers helped each other, GM helped around the restaurant and asked how our meal was.  Hash browns like I've never had before!  Omelet one of the flakiest ever.  Homemade biscuits unbelievable.  Our server, Devon, was fantastic!  We will be back soon!  Great experience, great food, great environment!"}
{"text":"Great experience every time we visit and the staff is awesome!  I'm a big fan of Elmer's restaurants (parent company) in the Portland area. Food was good, tea refills kept coming with a smile. We're regulars now."}
{"text":"Visited the other day and the service was awesome! The food was good and the waitress went above and beyond. I got an omelet with hash browns and a biscuit. The portions were large, I ended up taking half my food home. Prices were good and I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really poor experience this morning. Got there at 8am. Seated right away. Sat for over 10 minutes with no acknowledgement, before the manager asked if we had been helped. She took our drink order and said a waitress would come to take our order. When she brought our drinks she took our order, bc I think she had realized things were going downhill in our section. We were happy she served us, rather than being served by the waitress who told two different tables around us that she was late this morning, and was afraid she was going to be written up, but it had been a long time since she did that, so she was hoping for the best, but if she started to cry, that was why. It was unbelievable and very unprofessional. You could tell she made people uncomfortable. They feigned sympathy but she really needed to be working and not talking about her personal problems. The food was decent, but we won't be back. The manager was the only thing that made the situation anything other than abominable. She was working hard, waiting tables. Not sure if someone didn't show up, or what, but like I said, we won't be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here two days in a row while visiting Gilbert. The restaurant is clean, service was prompt and the food was very good.  We will definitely dine here again when we return to Gilbert."}
{"text":"Came into eggs n'joe possibly the best breakfast I have ever had. The service was fantastic, Shelly was a breath of fresh air. We are visiting from Indiana and asked about trails to hike. She brought out Colin what nice young man and spent 5 minutes helping us decide what was best for us. Great experience we will most definitely be vack."}
{"text":"It's the same exact menu as Elmers in the Pacific NW with smaller portions for the same price.  Our waitress was delightful, though."}
{"text":"This place is so wonderful. We got there about 8:50AM on a Friday morning and were seated promptly. Had to wait about 5 min before we got waited on and it took a while to get our food, but otherwise, our waitress was very friendly and the food was wonderful. I got the German Pancake with strawberries in sauce and I loved it! You can't get German Pancakes everywhere, so I was in heaven. My husband got an omlet with dungeness crab in it, he liked it very much. The coffee was good.....not at all weak. I like a medium brew and it was perfect. I would say though, I did have to ask for flavored coffee creamer. I don't know why they wouldn't bring some when I first asked for creamer? But, now that I know to ask for it, I will right up front. 
We were glad that we got there when we did, because shortly after 9am, there was a wait list. 
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I wasn't overly impressed with the food (3 stars) but the service was great. It's what made this restaurant a 4 star instead of a 3 star for me. The hostess guy was great, took our name, informed us of the wait and when the table was ready he kindly motioned for us to follow him. 

Our waitress (didn't get her name) was great. Very kind and attentive. I ordered the breakfast burrito, but like I mentioned above, I was not overly impressed. That said, I will definitely go back and try something else. I am curious to see if the Skillet or Chicken fried steak can impress me. Stay tuned for the updated review. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First visit: Wide selection of breakfast option, nice decor, good service.

Everything arrived  fairly quickly and hot. Nice egg dishes, fluffy pancakes, good biscuits.

Our only complaint was that the coffee pot was not left on the table.

Good price/fair value.

We'll be back."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre at best service was worse. Waiting to be served they never came back to fill my coffee so I guess they are egg and no lore Joe"}
{"text":"Friends took us to this place for breakfast today and right away we were warmly welcomed by Hope, Trevor, Cisco and our server Angela.  The menu was varied including a variety of breakfast and lunch items.  We had a short wait due to the popularity of the restaurant. Our food was served warm and in a timely manner considering how busy they were.  We would happily return and only wish they were a little closer to us"}
{"text":"So this is a tough review for me! I give this place 4 stars on many fronts, except for an important one (keep reading to see where they exceeded expectations and where they fell short): 
CLEANLINESS - the restaurant was spotless; it had a nice bustle to it, yet one would have thought we were the first people to ever sit at that table. (the ground was clean underneath it too, know what I mean? I always look before I step and I appreciate a clean \"under-table\"!)
SERVICE - periodically refreshed coffee, no wait, happy/knowledgable waitstaff; I felt very comfortable. They weren't pushy and definitely wanted to please.
VALUE - the portions were LARGE (I had the lingonberry crepes and they came with 2 eggs and bacon) and the price was RIGHT (my breakfast was under $10 and my son's was $4...before tip our total came to $17). I don't want them too, but in North Scottsdale they could totally charge more.
FOOD QUALITY - I was very satisfied: I tried my son's chocolate chip kids pancakes (also a large portion) and they were delicious. He ate them all (and he generally prefers not to eat, if he can at all help it). The bacon was cut slightly thick and it was crunchy but not overly crisp or dry. Well cooked and very flavorful. I could have used a little more lingonberries on my crepes, but such are ridiculous 1st World problems.

Here's the rub: there just wasn't a Wow factor, and I guess I really thought there would be. The great name + trendy outside decor and signage + cool and inviting interior = high expectations. But the menu is just average, it seems kind of limited without any major standouts (almost like a Denny's with their Big Slams) and there's nothing really urging me to go back.

The thing is, I'm sure I'll be back at some point - it's in a convenient location, it's a good value, there are several food options for me and for my son, and has a comfortable and clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food however not really quick. I had the Acacado  omelette ,only issue was too much pico...
I will try again"}
{"text":"Today was our first time here and of course it was as busy as we expected for a Sunday morning at 9am. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated and there wasn't immediately a high chair available for our 8 month old. Food took longer than we expected, but despite any of that we loved the food and the service both from our server Michelle and the host staff. Food was excellent and we will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"OK, so 1st visit this morning. And, its basically less than a mile from home.  We were sat immediately,even though it was very busy. Our server was very nice and attentive.  We normally like to go have brunch on Sundays where we can have Bloody Mary's, mimosas or some fancy breakfast cocktail. But, wanted to just do someting basic.  I had the German pancake, delicious, and hubby had Egg, Crabmeat Benedict, again delicious. He did have a mimosa as they must only have beer and wine license. Mimosa was OK, fresh squeezed juice (a plus) but just a mere splash of the champs.  There was an incident with my pancake, and the manager immediately took care of the issue, ( I couldn't eat the pancake)he brought me a new one really quick and comped us.  He was very apologetic and he treated the situation appropriately. (Coming from a family that owns a restaurant) Service these days is not what it should be, except for here.  I give this place an A+!!"}
{"text":"Hearty food, large portions and reasonably priced.  German Pancakes and Berry French Toast are delicious and large enough to split. Attentive servers, friendly, open atmosphere.  Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Egg N Joe is opened for breakfast and lunch but we went for lunch. I had the Garden Fresh sandwich which was pretty good and my friend \"wanted something different\"....he had the chicken fried steak sandwich which he said was a \"good choice.\" They offer unlimited French fries...yay! This was our first time here because it seems like there is an extensive wait...not today, we walked right in! Service was good and the restaurant was clean. The manager was friendly \"I believe his name was Cisco\" walked around checking on the customers, making sure we were all taken care of.  We were pretty satisfied with our experience!"}
{"text":"Pretty sure this place could be the BEST egg cookery I've ever been to. My eggs over medium were flawless! Chef Ramsey would be pleased! I am excited to go back and see if my poached eggs come out equally flawless! 5 stars may be coming if they can get those right!"}
{"text":"My family and I got the country biscuit breakfast, strawberry crepes, chocolate chip dollar pancakes and the kids big foot breakfast. Our food was great and our server Phillip was even better. Best service we've had since visiting AZ 3 weeks ago. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cute place, very commercially decorated. The food was ok.  The hash browns were beautifully pictured on the menu, but seriously under cooked when they were served to us.  Crunchy raw potato.  You can probably tell from my photo.  The eggs were cooked nice, but it was advertised that it came with a Pilsbury biscuit?  Come on, I could have done that at home.  It was really just an upscale Denny's, which is fine if you like that sort of thing.  The service was excellent and the location was nice with outdoor seating available."}
{"text":"People Wake Up!
This is a really nice breakfast place! Service is awesome, food is really good. I get they have a few glithches, just give them a chance! Food is awesome, down home breakfast!  Try it!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!!!! We called and put our name down and we only had a five mins wait when we got here. The servers were absolutely friendly/attentive and the food was heavenly. Everybody's cravings were fulfilled and bellies were left satisfied. Highly recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"Second time eating here in a week. I love this place and the kids love the menu too. First time I've seen all three of them clean their plates. The only place I've found German Pancakes on the menu and they were made perfectly. It's inspired me to start making them for the kids again. Cheryl was our server the first visit and was fantastic! She believes in the company and your concept. Angela seated us and couldn't be more charming and perfect for a grumpy family who haven't had coffee and food. Collin took great care of us today. So nice! Looking forward to frequenting this place."}
{"text":"If you like grill ,greasy hashbrowns and  chewy cheese in your omelette,go here!!
  Also,Theresa; waitress ,should really find a job she likes."}
{"text":"I like their breakfast skillets, but some day I'm going to order the German Pancake just because. It looks so good! Always nice people, good food."}
{"text":"Easter Sunday, very little wait, good food, good service.  My granddaughters gobbled their food ergo the five star rating."}
{"text":"Visited Elmer's in Palm Springs and couldn't wait to come to Egg N Joe in North Scottsdale and it doesn't disappoint.  Elmers is known for their German Pancake and so I am glad that Egg N Joe also has it on their menu as well.  The new location is located in a shopping center, there was plenty of parking and the restaurant is shiny and new, which is nice, but for anyone looking for that old style Elmer's look, you wont find it here and I prefer the old style, but that doesn't in anyway affect the food which is really good.  The menu is large with many choices.  Of course I had the German Pancake and my dining partner ordered an omelet.  We shared both and that was plenty!  The pancake was a bit overcooked on the edges but still delicious and the omelet was also good. The fruit on the plate was very fresh which is nice because so many times at other restaurants the fruit is not good.

Take the trip to Egg N Joe, you will be happy you did."}
{"text":"This review is not about the food but about calling the restaurant to find out if they take to-go orders. A young man answered the phone and was very rude. He thought I asked if they take reservations so I clarified my question. He then told me that no they do not take to go orders, with no explanation why (because on Yelp it indicates they do), very rudely, and hung up the phone. I have never eaten here. Why are people so rude?  Grow up. Learn customer service."}
{"text":"I had breakfast ,
The food was basic and good but not exceptional . The NW breakfast potatoes seemed  plain , this establishment pitches it's self as a unique eatery, yet looked and felt like a new upscale Denny's with seriously plain decor , the food was well presented and cooked other than he boring NW breakfast potatoes which tastes uncooked inside, the  waiters and pwaitresses were polite and professional . I will try it again but hope for a better taste with the food and livelier experience ."}
{"text":"Great food from a manageable menu with outstanding customer service. A terrific addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Two months ago I went to Egg N' Joe for the first time and rated it 5 stars. I was very disappointed on my second visit. Our 2 minute wait on a Sunday morning was a surprise (now I know why). Our server was polite, but didn't offer any suggestions - like the loaded hash browns. Their Specials now are for people who like sweet breakfasts; nothing for \"Eggs and Such\" breakfast lovers. We had the traditional Ranch Breakfast with bacon. The eggs were small and over cooked; we ordered them over medium. The bacon was thick and rubbery on the ends. The hash browns  were hardly cooked at all. It looked like we were served fettuccini, but tasted like under cooked potatoes. The Biscuit wad very good. Nothing special here, I'm in no hurry to go back. Stick to Downtown Gilbert, if you want an amazing breakfast EVERY time."}
{"text":"Made a brief stop at this overpriced restaurant last week. Got seated and had seen an omelette that was interesting online, but there was no prices listed. Well, the price of the Southwest omelette was a crazy $14. Not many egg dishes are worthy of that price, especially one out in the middle of San tan. Also, a very strange menu as most food items seem to be sponsored by another company, like the ham and other items. Lunch items very limited as well."}
{"text":"We have been watching this building go up for the last several months as we shopped at the nearby Costco. So after the initial opening rush we went there this AM. They have both indoor and outdoor dining. The indoor atmosphere was similar to most breakfast places, lots of tables and booths but curiously no counter. The wait staff was very attentive almost to a fault, The menu has many choices for breakfast and lunch, I ordered the German Pancake and my wife ordered something that was essentially two hash brown patties with stuff inside them, it also came with 2 eggs and bacon. Were were told in advance the German pancake takes approx. 18 min (we've ordered what other restaurants call a Dutch Baby and understood they take longer to prepare). The drinks were continually refilled and every few minutes the waitress came by to assure us that it would only be a few more minutes.  After the fourth update the reminders became annoying. When our food did arrive it looked as good as the menu depicted it, however the food once we began to eat it was a big disappointment. The German pancake had way too much powdered sugar (1/8\" deep or more) three lemon wedges and a small dollop of butter. As a comparison if you ordered this same item at the :Original Pancake House it comes with a scant dusting of powdered sugar and lots of butter. (Pancakes and butter seem to really go together much more than pancakes and powered sugar) The dough in the pancake was flavorless, the powdered sugar even when scraped off had made the whole thing extremely too sweet, and the dollop of butter was grossly insufficient for the size of the pancake. (Note: I did not request more butter although I imagine I could have). 
I was really looking forward to this item. To begin with the outer crust was cold (most other restaurants pre-heat the plate to prevent this) and since the outer ridge was cold and chewy I basically ate the inner part. What a huge let down. My wife never commented about her two hash brown patties while we were in the restaurant (she did however share the way over smoked bacon that she did not find tasty nor did I), but once home said the patties were at best just so-so. Our meal consisting of two entries, & one coffee came to almost $25.00.  I asked my wife if  she might consider going back a second time to see if the experience was a fluke but she said there was nothing redeeming about this visit that gave her any reason to return. All in all this was a one and done visit."}
{"text":"We enjoyed our visit for brunch. Delicious menu options to choose from. Devon waited on our table and provided excellent customer service. We opted for outdoor seating as the wait for a table was 25-30 minutes. The outdoor patio was covered and had a pretty good misting system."}
{"text":"Very delicious, great menu.  Courteous and knowledgeable waiter.  Will come back.  My country fried steak skillet was wonderful."}
{"text":"Holy balls, this place is fire, I mean to legit, the German pancakes are a giant crepe, \"good lord that's a lot of pancake\".  The eggs were spot on for being over medium and believe me not every cook knows how to cook eggs correctly, I know weird right?.  I definitely recommend this place, and will be coming here regularly, don't let the host scare you away with the wait time, he said 35 mins and we were sat in about 10ish, kid friendly place as well, the blue hairs love it as well."}
{"text":"We come here regularly for the German combo.  Great taste and value!  Always busy unless you come early."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday morning with my wife for a usual Friday brunch/lunch date.  We've been trying new spots around town and up on the list was this place.  

Let's dig right in.  The menu was very limited, and it's obvious this place is either from the Northwest or is aiming towards a Northwest crowd with Tillamook cheeses, \"northwest\" hashbrowns, \"Ivar's\" clam chower, and dungeness crab fare.  Other than a few unique dishes, the menu is limited, and overall unappealing.  I chose the chicken fried steak skillet, and my wife had some sort of Southwest omelet. Since I'm from the Northwest and grew up on Ivar's seafood, I opted for a bowl of the clam chodwer to share for a warm up.

Well, the chowder, which claimed to be Ivar's, was not even close.  i hate to be one of those people from Philly who rips every cheesesteak in town, or Chicagoan who rips every deep dish pizza and italian beef sandwich, but this was not good.  It had the consistency of grandma's sausage gravy, which is thick and floury.  I seriously felt like I swallowed a dough ball just after a few bites.  Ivar's might want to look into the claims themselves, because it's not even close.

As far as the Northwest Hashbrowns, I can't remember ever eating them burnt to a crisp and tasting like the oil used to cook them in, nor has it ever been a preference of fellow Northwesterners and Seattleites.  Maybe the potatos are from idaho, bu that's the only NW part of them.  They had a cheap, oily, burnt taste to them, and were not very appetizing.

The skillet was.....meh.  Very low quality.  It was similar to a dish you'd get at a place that rhymes with Penny's. And that might be a low blow to America's Favorite Diner.  The skillet came with scrambled eggs and it appeared they couldn't be changed to over easy, at least that's what i got from the reaction of the waitress when I inquired into a scenario which would substitute the scrambled for over easy.  NOTE TO EGG & JOE:  SKILLETS COME WITH OVER EASY EGGS, NOT SCRAMBLED.  Sheesh...

The omelet on my wifes plate was folded so neatly into a little envelope like shape it almost looked processed, like a piece of American cheese folded into a plastic cover.  Again, hasbrowns burnt, and avacados which may have been picked a little early.  Not impressive, and definitely a disappointment.

The service left a little something to be desired.  The lady who took our order was kind and friendly, and obviously overworked and overloaded, because she was running like crazy.  the food runner who brought us our food didn't say a word, and just handed me the plates instead of at least asking where to set them down.  Unimpressive, and I'm not a snobby diner who expects the moon. There were two high school age, too cool for school teenagers working the front.  Neither of them were really welcoming or friendly, and when I was paying my bill, they obviosuly weren't into doing their jobs.

Overall, failing grade E&J.  We will not be back, despite the NW flare, or attempt thereof.  I will stick to my hole in the wall diner and local QC spot for breakfast.  Yet another strip mall joint who thinks they can get with lackluster products and no emphasis on customer retention."}
{"text":"We ate here on Monday, 27 March 2017 AD. We loved the service and food! The staff was friendly, the menu has some unique offerings and everything was well priced. The restaurant  was clean and bright. We will be back!

A solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great new location for brunch- obviously the Gilbert population found out about it so, as anywhere on the weekend, they have a wait, but worth it! 

Our server was phenomenal, I wish I remembered her name. She was a slightly older woman with an accent but she was so on the ball once we were seated. She kept our coffee and water full, made us laugh and helped me pick an entree (which is tough when it all looks amazing!)

I had the veggie omelet with fruit and biscuit and my fiancée had the hearty breakfast with a bunch of meats, eggs, hash browns etc.

My omelette was amazing- and she also brought us salsa and hot sauce because we are freaks and love them both. 

Amazing service, food, price is great for the food you receive. Recommend for any Gilbert residents."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast joint!! Amazing choices that leaving you feeling full.  Kids menu has a great selection.  Highly recommend the crab Benedict.  Popular spot, be prepared to have a small wait, but it's worth it."}
{"text":"If you like IHOP, you'll love this place. Unfortunately, that's not a compliment. Granted this is a new establishment - The coffee is subpar, food is mediocre and some staff were awkward, for lack of a better term. This place would be groundbreaking if it were 1995. Good luck."}
{"text":"2nd update- they finally came through! There was a mix up with the email,  but now things are good! Redeemed today and Kellie was very friendly and on top of it. Food was filling and everything came out very quickly. If you are craving savory, get the potato pancakes! They're amazing!

 Update, so after I wrote this review , someone  from their establishment contacted me and referred me to the store manager, candi.  We had some correspondence back and forth . She offered a gift certificate  to have me come back .  That was right after I wrote this review and I have yet to receive the gift certificate. So, to sum things up, my one star rating still stands . 

Just went to have breakfast and was told it was a 40 minute wait. I get it because it was pretty busy. The problem is that I had my 6 year old daughter with me and I knew she wouldn't be able to wait 40 minutes to sit down, so I asked the hostess to put in a to go order for me and she said they didn't do that on the \"weekends\". I get it if it was a phone order,  but I was standing right in front of them. Seriously? How do you turn down service to a mother and her child??!! Should have taken my small order."}
{"text":"I'm a fan!  I had the Avocado and Crab omelette, and was extremely impressed by the amount of fresh crab meat that was inside.  Well worth the price, only $14.00.  Wait time was not bad at all for a Saturday morning. Less than 20min and they offered free coffee while you wait.  Service was impeccable.  Joe our server was attentive, kind, and knew the menu well!  This will be my regular weekend spot!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times, the food and service are fantastic. 

I highly recommend their hash browns as a side. They are so fresh and delicious.

They also have amazing coffee:)"}
{"text":"I love eating at this place. The service is great and I love the food, if I lived closer I would eat here a few times a week. All the food ingredients are fresh and very good, I love the coffee too.
Me and a group of my friends meet every Sunday for breakfast and we rotate around the area to different restaurants so I would rate this place number 1."}
{"text":"Kid that sat us was super nice and friendly! The waitress was nice, the one time we saw her. She took our order and that was it. Other staff member brought the food, different one checked on us, and then I had to go find someone for a box and our check. Which was brought out by yet another staff member. I never got a coffee refill, which sitting outside in the little chill would have been nice. The food was just ok. Clearly it was frozen food and not made in house, no seasoning at all. We probably won't be back. I guess I should say that our waitress did come back out one more time. Only after my card had already been run, I feel like she was just trying to salvage her tip. \"I told them I have to get outside. But they kept giving me tables inside.\" was her excuse. Which only made it worse for me, knowing she knew we were out there and she still ignored us."}
{"text":"Yummy eggs and joe! Busy lunch hour and 25 min wait for food, so our waitress gave us a coupon for a free entree at next visit. Not necessary but very appreciated. I will go back! 
Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food!"}
{"text":"Great food & fast service....omlets & pancakes were melt in your mouth good.  Service was also great and very responsive."}
{"text":"It's a newer breakfast/lunch place in the south Gilbert area. Food is good and plenty of options. They have a decent kids menu as well. The host staff still needs to get their act together as there isn't a consistent level of service, they can't estimate wait time AT ALL. If they say say half hour, expect an hour. You'll be waiting a lot longer than they tell you, especially on the weekend. Weekends are super busy so it's a good sign that the food is good. At the same time south Gilbert doesn't have  a lot of good breakfast/brunch options to accommodate the family population of the area, so this is a great addition to the area. If you come here try the German pancakes! Very delicious! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Interior had a mid-century modern deco feel and is bright and homey. Come hungry and leave happy. The supervisor is extremely nice if you get a chance to meet her."}
{"text":"Such a positive experience for a weekend breakfast.  Prompt and friendly service.  Food was tasty and as ordered even with modifications.  Sunny, light, bright, clean and tastefully decorated.  There is also an outdoor refreshment station and shade provided for those waiting outside.  A definite plus as the temperatures start to soar."}
{"text":"Very overrated and insanely crowded. Although it may be a new restaurant, there is nothing really exciting about it. Unless you like to wait in line"}
{"text":"I ordered a veggie omelet and I added turkey and got bacon on the side. My breakfast came with hash browns and toast. I judge a place based on the hash browns. Jess hash browns weren't the best. They seemed greasy and undercooked. I was so disappointed with this place. I don't think I'd go back. Snooze is still my number one choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"Went to get breakfast and they told us to wait a minute for a table and seated everyone that came in after us. Then told us they didn't have any tables available so we would have to wait till one became available. So we left and will not go back. Terrible costumer service."}
{"text":"Seriously fell for this place the first time. 

Had the best server...I wish I could remember his name. He's a white guy, brown hair, with glasses, and legitimately knew everything about the company and every dish on the menu. He also was just an impeccable waiter. 

Some of the hostess ladies could have better greeting/farewell (like, a smile?) but beyond that, it is THE BOMB"}
{"text":"The food was okay, ordered bacon which came out burnt. The waitress is the main reason I give this a 1. The service was horrible. She was rude and did not seem to want to be working. We were needed something and we had to shout it out to her since she didn't want to walk to the table. I forgot her name. But we did write on the receipt for her to be more engaging. So maybe the manager will see this and remember that receipt and have a talk with her. Even though the service was shitty we still tipped"}
{"text":"Very unimpressed. Limited menu, fairly high priced, and my breakfast was very bland. In addition the side of pancakes were over done - almost burnt. I'm still trying to understand how an omelette can have 5 ingredients and taste like paper. I enjoy going out to eat for breakfast more than any other meal and I've had much better in the east side. I was really looking forward to this place opening since it's so close to my house but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The food here was absolutely delish! The service was great and the prices were reasonable especially with the quality!"}
{"text":"This is a great little breakfast/lunch spot off the beaten path.  Gets a little busy if you're there on a Saturday or Sunday morning, so plan accordingly.  They have a good selection of items and the service is always friendly.  Definitely give it a try if you're looking for a good, hearty breakfast."}
{"text":"Fabulous food!
Seems like it's 80's diner style...the hash browns are fantastic and the home made biscuits are great!
If you're looking for a great new breakfast spot in Gilbert, this isn't!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service by Curtisea. The place was packed at 9:30 on a Thursday morning..still had fast friendly service."}
{"text":"My breakfast choice was the potato pancake, egg and bacon. The potato pancake is one of the best I've had with perfect mix of onion and chives. Served with sour cream and apple sauce. The bacon slices were meaty but one was half cooked loosing a star."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum    
We love going to Egg N' Joe on Sunday's my husband is off. Great food with fast friendly service."}
{"text":"This place was average.  It wasn't overly creative with the menu- typical chain restaurant.  The service was slow when we arrived.  We walked right in, but then waited for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Typical diner, but very yummy! 

My husband and I stopped in a  couple weeks ago for breakfast. We enjoyed the food there and would definitely return"}
{"text":"Egg & Joe's is the best breakfast in Scottsdale! Great environment...superb service (Thanks Cheryl!) and outstanding food.
Love it!"}
{"text":"Chicken fried steak and chicken fried steak skillet was nothing special. The gravy was a little runny. Our friend got eggs benedict and eggs were over hard. Not poached, not runny. They have egg in the name and didn't cook the eggs right...."}
{"text":"The place was packed for a Friday morning but service was quick and pleasant. Everything looked delicious - the German pancakes were bigger than their plates! Can't wait to go back. The potato pancakes were amazing!"}
{"text":"We came here a year ago and loved it, not so much this time. 
Our server was bubbly and attentive so that was a star, our food was flavorful and good so that's a star. But as another server was dropping off our food besides allowing my cold toast to slip onto the table she seemed irritated that I wanted the butter they forgot to put on my plate. 
As you can see the fruit was less then appetizing, had to ask for coffee etc.."}
{"text":"Great service and great country fried steak and eggs. First time visit. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I were fortunate to have breakfast here after a great hike.  We all ordered different items so we could sample from each other.  Only girlfriends can do that!  The German Pancake with lemon was amazing, the pancakes as fabulous as their reputation, the Sundevil skillet was spicy and delicious as was the bacon filled omelet I ordered.  The coffee was perfect, a breakfast place always needs great coffee.  Everyone in North Scottsdale should be celebrating the addition of this great restaurant to their neighborhood.  Special shout out to Bill, John, De'Shun, Jerry, Teresa and Colton who made our visit extra special.  We three hikers thank you and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great location in Northern Scottsdale, and very friendly attentive staff. On a scale of 1-10, the food was okay, about 5.5 to a 6. Much tastier and cleaner than Denny's or IHOP, but only a grade higher. The bummer part was the coffee. They only offer one kind and they don't carry cold creamer (like half and half) for coffee creamer junkies like me. I just love a hot cup of joe with cold half and half and they don't have it, only little room temp creamers.  Had the German pancake, it was good, but the presentation and playing of it was better. The scrambled eggs were definitely made from liquid eggs, not fresh cracked.... so that bummed us too. A little more pricier than Denny's or IHOP, but overall, it was an okay breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Stpopped in for the first time and ordered the French Toast. The vanilla flavoring made the FT  extra tasty and it came with 3 big slices. Service was good and place clean. Definitely will be back to try other favorites."}
{"text":"Just had an awesome breakfast at Egg N' Joe with Tara as our server. Couldn't ask for friendlier staff - from the service staff to management. Food is delicious- biscuits are fluffy and huge! Everything was just right from the German pancakes to our eggs. Thanks Tara for making our day!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times and so far so good, we seem to get the same waitress and she is the best,"}
{"text":"The place was much better when it first opened. The food is now mediocre and the restaurant feels like it can use a good cleaning. Disappointing because I used to love their baked pancake...will drive the extra 5 miles and wait in line at Butterfieds for it now"}
{"text":"Came Saturday morning with the expectation of a wait. They had a table with complimentary \"JOE\" out front to help pass the time. We were told 20-30min wait and ended up waiting 15min. The service was then exceptional, our server topped my \"JOE\" probably 5-6times, it was always hot and full. The eggs were terrific, hashbrowns looked burned but they were a perfect crisp and complimented perfectly with my biscuit. The kiddo ordered the pancake and couldnt finish it because of the size but enjoyed as much as she could. We will definitely be returning! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here with my son, the eggs Benedict were delicious! So was the fish and chips 

I love this place, never had a bad meal. Everything is fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a surprise. We had a lovely Sunday brunch today after we arrived at 10:30 and we're seated within 20 minutes. The wait staff was very pleasant and prompt and the food was delicious.  The German pancake and the potato pancakes were the table favorites and I don't think you could go wrong with those choices.  A good stop for sure.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"My wife,grandkids and i are enjoying breakfast . So far the coffee is good. The kids got coupons for free  breakfast. Very friendly  staff.the food is excellent, biscuits are the bomb."}
{"text":"Pleasant experience at Egg N Joe yesterday! The food was good and the staff was excellent. Our server was Gus and he was awesome. Definitely recommend this place to new customers"}
{"text":"Our breakfast and coffee was super yummy! 
Tara, our waitress, was fabulous! She was very attentive and knowledgeable and made our dining experience incredible, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Good place, like that is it so close to our home.  The first time I we sat outside.  It was a nice Sunday morning.  I had a regular breakfast with eggs over medium, bacon, hash brown potatoes and a biscuit.  My husband had a skillet. It was very good.  The second time we came with the kids and we sat inside.  The kids had pancakes, scrambled egg and sausage and I had the german pancake combo breakfast.  It is huge, I am glad I shared it with my husband.  We will definitely come here again for breakfast, it is a solid place, with pleasant service and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We went here while on our Michael Chentfant's Half Ass Arizona Tour. Located in a strip mall, the decor is nothing to write home about but everything else is, especially the service.

Our waitress, I can't believe I can't remember her name, was so helpful and attentive to our group of 8. No glass went below 1/2 full.  I went with the fish and chips and was glad I did. The fish was crisp and not full of grease and the fries were spot on. Tartar sauce was outstanding. 

Our waitress heard our table talking about their famous German pancake and soon she had brought one out for the entire table to try, free of charge. Outstanding pancake, outstanding customer awareness.

Not one of our party complained about their food and had only nice things to say about our lunch. If you are in the area, give them a try. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident after a Costco run. Had the Crab omelette. Let's just say I went back the next day fir the same thing! So good and service was super friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast , Very Slow Service , Ordered Blueberry Pancakes , asked what pancake syrup was and got a answer of pancake syrup, looking for good old maple syrup not there, pancakes were Okay pretty much tasteless...Place used to be busy all the time, maybe 8 people in there ...Definately wouldn't go Back...."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my family since it is close to where we live in Gilbert and has a good location being near San Tan Marketplace and Costco. Expect a long wait on the weekends, which can take anywhere from 30-60 minutes, depending on party size. They give you a buzzer, which lets you walk around and check out the other stores without having to stay in the restaurant. There is both outdoor and indoor seating, so depending on how warm/cold it is, sometimes stating you'll take the first available, which might mean sitting outside, may get you seated sooner.

This business seems to be rooted from the NW, since many of their ingredients, such as the crab and coffee are from the NW. They do offer coffee outside while you are waiting for your table, which is a nice touch.

As for food, there are many options from omelettes, to Benedicts, pancakes, to their famous german pancakes, which are gigantic!!! For most of their sweet options, they offer add-on meals so you can still eat some eggs and hashbrowns. The first time I came here I ordered the german pancake with mixed berries. It was very large, filling, and warm. My family did have to wait a long time for a table, since there were 6 of us. We ordered immediately when we were seated because we looked at menus beforehand, expecting to get our orders out faster, but that was not the case. It was very disappointing to get our meal very late, especially because there were equally large groups seated near us and they all got their orders before us, even though we ordered and were seated at least 15 minutes before them. Additionally, some of the added-meal orders didn't come out until very late, but we saw them sitting in the pick-up window for awhile and there were servers standing around chatting...

The second time I came here I ordered the crab benedict with the french vanilla cappuccino. The cappuccino comes with a heaping of whipped cream and one free refill, which was a nice surprise! Coffee gets free refills, too. The crab benedict comes with poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, and bacon. I wasn't a fan of the bacon added to the dish, since it didn't seem to mix well with the crab, but that's more of a personal preference. It would have tasted better with avocado. I was also disappointed with the benedict because the crab meat, although real, was fairly cold, which made me suspicious of how long it had either seated at the pick-up window or that they hadn't heated it up enough, since some pieces were lukewarm. 

They do also serve lunch, which I may consider trying, but I think that with the many options in the area and from these 2 experiences, I probably will plan on going somewhere else for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Okay, seriously, this place has wonderful food. Everything tastes homemade & is delicious.
My friends and I were waiting on my car to be serviced, so we stopped by this place for breakfast. So yum. I wanted to take some home, but I ate every bite of my breakfast!!! My friend raved about her food as well. We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Other than significant waiting time to be seated, the food was excellent and the service was good. The portions were big to huge, and my friends and I certainly thought you get your money's worth; I personally would rather have quality and taste over quantity but, when I get both, it is a bonus. The Hungry Rancher, the Garden Veg Omelet, the Classic Egg Benedict, and the German Pancakes were all excellent tasting.

The servers, that's right, not just our assigned server, but others came by from time to time and asked us if we needed anything. This was at their busy breakfast time and the place was packed. But we were not overlooked. Good show!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm....great coffee, excellent breakfasts.....super service.  Our entrees took more time than normal, a new chef trainee didn't poach the eggs quite like the head chef preferred...so she made him start over.  The learning curve was delicious! The chef came to our table to explain too.  A new fave!!!"}
{"text":"What a great experience!  My husband and I went to The Egg And Joe this morning for the first time. They have only been open a week but they certainly have it together! Food was great with a little different selection than most breakfast places. Devon our server was excellent! Attentive but not too much. Very pleasant and knowledgeable. We throughly enjoyed our breakfast and again a shout out to wonderful service Devon!"}
{"text":"Update: This is my new favorite breakfast place.  The pancakes are light, fluffy and delicious, the coffee is amazing, and my Denver omelette was one of the best I've ever had. On my second visit I had the Blueberry pancakes and eggs over medium, again both cooked perfectly and delicious. You have to try this place!!!"}
{"text":"Eggs were very good, as was the bacon, ham and sausage. Coffey was good.  Hash browns were not very good, had an after taste like iron.  Atmosphere was like an old style diner and was good.  Bathrooms very clean. 

Overall price was a bit high for 2, almost 30$, not including tip."}
{"text":"In town visiting family and got a thumbs up from everyone for the choice.  Thanks yelp for making me shine once again!

You have to have the German pancakes!!!  An experience you'll not forget."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast this morning after seeing some decent reviews. For a Sunday morning it was steady but not overly crowded. It had your typical breakfast place feel to it. I don't know that i will be returning as the entire experience was sub-par. We ordered the hungry rancher and classic eggs Benedict. First the Hungry Rancher - lots of food. 3 eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, hash browns and a biscuit. The eggs were grossly undercooked as were the hash browns. By the time i got around to being able to flag someone down i didn't feel like waiting around to have my meal remade. The eggs Benedict was lack luster. Didn't have much flavor to go with a soggy English muffin."}
{"text":"We went on Easter Sunday with a large party. The service provided by Tara was excellent. The food was also exactly as ordered and was delicious."}
{"text":"great breakfast place! food is delicious and staff is friendly and smiley! the French toast was probably the best I've ever had. everything here was done wonderfully and I'm happy to have a great breakfast place so close to me! the place was packed upon arrival but we got a table in about 5 minutes. no complaints just excellence!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast this morning, after dropping off our car for service.  

We were fully prepared to wait 20-30 minutes on a busy Saturday, but we must have timed it right.  We were seated in less than five minutes. The fact that it felt like Spring here in the Valley made it doubly nice

Eggs N' Joe actually proved to be fun, enjoyable and Tasty!~  And, the coffee will make your head snap back. Wowza!  A strong, but a not caffeine laden cup of Joe, unlike the green mermaid.

A while back we were invited to an event sponsored by the ownership group, Elmer's Restaurants via email.  But in the end we couldn't make it since we were out of state.  It was a nice gesture. And after coming here today, we are sad we missed it!

The food at Eggs N' Joe is very good. The bacon was thick cut and had a nice smokey taste.  The eggs were made to order perfectly. The sausage links had a slight weisswurst taste. Everything was fresh and tasted like it was made to order. Nice!

Out bill came to $25.96 before taxes and gratuities. Our Northwest Lumberjack coffee was $2.49 each. The Bacon Ranch was $9.49 and my Hungry Rancher, see photo was $11.49

I only wished we lived nearby, so I could get some of their Lumberjack Joe each morning. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this location.  It was bleh.  I had the crab benedict  which was just ok.  The service was awful, I waited almost 10 minutes at 8am once I was seated to have my order taken and was only check on during one fly-by.  My coffee sat empty and cold for most of my meal.  I won't be back.  So many better breakfast options for $17.77 in the area that would have wow'ed me."}
{"text":"Seriously good breakfast. Love the chicken apple sausage! Hash browns were cooked perfectly, eggs exactly over medium, every bit what I ordered. Hash browns weren't loaded with margarine or butter neither were the eggs. I would very much come back here to have breakfast. A perfect 10!"}
{"text":"Eating at Egg N' Joes was nice but nothing spectacular.  We had the potatoes cakes which were different but pretty dense and very hard to finish.  That said the staff was super friendly and very accommodating."}
{"text":"I am rating this low for the service. We were a party of 2 on Saturday am and chose outside seating. Outside seating was completely vacant except of one other party of two. Misters and shade- no problem for us we were given a 15 minute estimate - and waited over 30 minutes to be called that our table was ready. Upon checking in at the host station-our pager was taken and there we sat as other people buzzers were going off and being Sat inside etc. - I finally inquired with the host - that I was not understanding why we were called and not seated--- he asked \"who are you? And ohh I didn't know that was you\" other customers were also experiencing upset and confusion by an unorganized - clearly inexperienced host. It was a mess!  Food was good once Sat and once approached by a server, bit not worth the experience or my time!
PS - another table where people were sitting before us - just went Inside to get menus! The host is a disaster!"}
{"text":"Great service - incredible Eggs Benedict.  Could not have had a better experience.  German pancakes on the radar for next time. 

Line out the door  for breakfast - open 6 days as of today. Glad to see they are having a great response as it reflects in the quality of food and service."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Egg N' Joe and I was very happy with it! I had the avocado eggs Benedict with bacon - so delicious! I'm very picky about my eggs Benedict (I don't like mine too runny) and these were cooked perfectly for me. My four companions, who ordered a variety of dishes, were all happy with their food as well. 
Our server, Julia, was very pleasant and efficient. Even though the restaurant was busy, our service continued to be excellent. Prices were reasonable as well. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Ok place ....not sure why there is always a wait...there are always a half a dozen tables available when we go but yet there is a 20 minute wait. I like the skillets. The employees are all so friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"There's definitely a wait but isn't that true of all breakfast spots?  Service was great and the atmosphere was typical...loud, tables and booth...nothing memorable. The outdoor dining was a nice option. 

My husband ordered oatmeal which he said was fine, nothing special. I ordered the crab avocado bacon omelette which was Yummy!  The flavors were delicate
and delicious. For the side I ordered pancakes (because I thought my hubby would regret having only oatmeal). The pancakes were good too, although a little cup of syrup is not enough....nor was the second little cup when we asked for more. I would give it a 5 but can't discount that the oatmeal was just oatmeal...but what else is oatmeal supposed to be?"}
{"text":"It was a very long wait to receive cold mediocre food. I can't understand the hype with this place. The  food is Dennys quality, and the cold German pancake was undercooked, and full dissapointed lack luster. The manager came by, and gave a half hearted apology. She really seemed disinterested in my cold food. I will never return, and tell everyone I know to avoid this place."}
{"text":"Love this place, took my hubby here for Father's Day. It's just like Elmers from the Northwest same exact menu we love their German pancakes. Highly recommended great service"}
{"text":"The first time we went there everything went well and friendly staff but this time made me never return. There was a wait we were given a buzzer. We waited and waited watching people that came way after us get seated I finally walked in and looked at the list and our name was not in it. I said hey our name is not on this she grabbed one out of the garbage and viola there is our name thrown away. So she said I will get you a seat and proceeded to seat people that just came and finally as we were walking out she sat us .  Eventually our waitress came took our order and we waited and waited and waited seeing people that came after us get their food finally I went up to the front asking to see the manager. The manager at the time was cleaning off a table and I was told by the girl that threw away the list it will be a bit and she laughed. Finally the woman manager came out with our food. I told her what transpired basically she could care less.  Our food was cold we were so hungry we ate it. She gave us 30% off the bill BIG DEAL!! Go to snooze and wait better food and much better service!   Stay away from here."}
{"text":"My breakfast burrito tasted as good as it looks!  Friendly and fast service, great little find in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I'm Not a fan based on our single experience here. The coffee was bitter and old tasting. The German pancake was weird. It just wasn't my thing. Crunchy on the outside and mushy on the inside and kind of bland. It reminded me of the flat bread they give you in Ethiopian restaurants in terms of texture but had no taste. We also split a breakfast burrito. My half had all the eggs. My husband's half had all the sausage. There were no onions at all and sparse cheese. It wasn't great. The avocados were good though. I like the patio area"}
{"text":"Yummy new place for breakfast/lunch. I love the avocado eggs benedict - with some steamed spinach. Kids meals are great and priced well. Thanks Shelly for the great service!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place.  Way over priced. Service so so, we were 4 people, two breakfast came out while the others waited for theirs. By the same theirs came we were done eating.   One had to wait on their toast and was almost done when it arrived.  The hash browns tasted like the oil was old."}
{"text":"Have been eyeing this place for months but the long breakfast lines I see as I drive to Pinnacle Peak have steered me clear.  Finally went by this morning and was pleasantly surprised.  I called ahead to put my name in and was told it would be about a 20 minute wait..which turned out to be right on.  They had complimentary coffee and water for people waiting outside which was a nice touch.  
When I walked in, I immediately knew I liked the place.  Yes, the paint scheme has a retro, diner feel to it.  My  7 year old even commented that it looked like a hotel!  However, I appreciated this throwback feel.  Especially after seeing so many restaurants in Scottsdale have the same cold and modern feel.  This felt comfortable for all ages to enjoy.

We were promptly seated.  We ordered the German pancake with a side of the glazed apples and a potato pancake.  Both were amazing and the type of craveable dishes that we will be returning for again.  Service was quick and friendly.  The kids menu wasn't bad either and definitely reasonable. 

I'm glad we finally tried it and now I need to try lunch!  While I know this place is owned by a restaurant \"group\" versus a locally owned place, I still like the overall feel of the restaurant and the food was good.  From their attentive staff, it is obvious they have taken some of the earlier reviews/critiques to heart and are putting forth a good product."}
{"text":"I've been to Egg N' Joes a few times but finally decided to Yelp it. Thought that giving it time would change my mind but I just realized that their food has just gone downhill. Maybe there are so busy with the weekend hustle that the quality control of their meals isn't as good as when we first started going there. 

Let me first start by saying the servers are the best out there. Their customer facing qualities are spectacular. It's the food, makes me want to make sure I've got potatoes, bacon and eggs at home to make my family a good ol' breakfast.

I get that sometimes we all want to go out and have someone else cook us our pancakes but there are a ton of breakfast joints to select from that is more affordable, so for sure check out the others before dining. 

Their Eggs Benedict was one of my choices at Egg and Joes and my husband and I both left feeling good only to fall ill an hour or so later. Bathroom anyone?

Anyways, go checkout First Watch or Hash Kitchen."}
{"text":"I've heard such great things about this place and we finally tried it. I don't understand all the hype, what am I missing? 

I had the Ranch Breakfast, delicious sausage but the rest of the meal including the coffee was nothing special. My husband had the German Pancake Combo with bacon, besides the German Pancake (which was almost as tasty as my own), again nothing special.

Mid morning, middle of the week, not busy. Server could've been having an off day or she isn't a people person, attentive but with a don't-bother-me attitude. Doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Way over due. This is our second time coming here. This time I had the waffle with sasuage links and over easy eggs. The eggs could have been presented alittle better but other than amazing and it was perfect , right amount of food. Our waitress Ashley was friendly and fast. If your looking for a great, outstanding place to have bfast, brunch or lunch try this place you'll fall in love. Also, the first time we had there German pancake oh my goodness heaven on a plate.  DUNGENESS CRAB BENNEITT!!"}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast this morning at Egg n Joe. It was clean, bright and friendly staff. We got lucky by getting Alissa B. I have never had a server smile as much as her. That's nice. My ice tea always stayed above half a glass. She was on top of everything. The food was hot, fresh, beautiful and tasted as good as it looked. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If u r going on a Sunday be ready to wait 1/2 to 1 hr.  But well Worth it food is great coffee strong will be going back soon!!!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit and I wasn't disappointed. I met my sister for a Sunday afternoon lunch and was delighted to be seated immediately! Our server Martin was engaging and attentive to our every need. We both ordered the veggie burger and were pleased with the fresh taste in each bite. The atmosphere is warm and inviting and the noise level was not overwhelming. I will definitely share this little jewel with my husband."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent environment! And we love Angela! The rating for this restaurant is right on the money. AND... Angela offered us a to-go cup of coffee as we were getting ready to leave, WOW who does that these days."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review as I wait. 45 min when we were quoted 35.. do not come here with a party of 5 or more since they have one BIG table and otherwise you will be at a small table with an extra chair tacked on the end. 

Tbc I guess if we ever see a waitress and order our food."}
{"text":"Great food super slow service. 
Wrought with good intention to be a good server but the lady (both times I've been I've had the same one) is just overwhelmed. Never enough cream for the coffee (very strong BTW). 
This last time my omelette was barely cooked but was still good. 
All in all 2.5-3.0 stars is about the best I can rate."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Egg n Joe's and I have to say the service was fantastic. Everyone was very friendly and the food was great. At the end of the meal they gave us a welcome package that included a certificate for a free meal so that was really nice! I would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Egg N' Joe .  I always order the vegetable omelet and crisp hash browns and a side of the gravy for the biscuit. My husband always orders a waffle and crisp hash browns. The food is always very good, as is the pleasant service. The restaurant is clean.  the last few times we have had Michelle as our server and she is a gem."}
{"text":"What! Finding out this place originated from the northwest made our breakfast date that much more special. Growing up in WA and have lived at the Northwest, this place is like a breath of fresh air. The food portions here are monstrous, but importantly delicious and pocket friendly! My wife had the German Pancake and it was impressive. Our server Matt took care of us and periodically came over to top off my coffee, which never was empty during the whole time we were there, and ask if need anything. He had a great sense of humor and very professional. From now on, Eggs N' Joe will be my first choice. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cheryl could use a waitress lesson. I sat down she handed me the menu and said do you need some time with the menu and i said yes and she stood there. 
So the garden burger was real good, fry's way to salty."}
{"text":"We were out in north Scottsdale early on a Saturday and this was the only breakfast place open for miles.
Coffee was a bit weak but good. I ordered the chorizo skillet and it came with scrambled eggs on top.I thought it should have over easy eggs but, ok.  It was tasty but a bit dry. It came with a buttermilk biscuit which tasted like Bisquick mix. Love Bisquick but expected an independent cafe to have homemade ones. I also thought it was odd to have a biscuit with a southwestern chorizo skillet.
My friend had the blueberry pancakes which were huge (3) and tasty but way too much food. 
Giant portions of average food. Made me sad because the place was so cute."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and my fave breakfast spot!!! Been here four times now and never disappoints. The service always exceeds my expectations, we had Dylan the first two times, and he was so fantastic! We didn't see him the next time we went in, and so Gus was our server the next time, and he was equally as fantastic! Both of them went out of their way to go the extra mile, deliver exceptional service, answered all of our questions, and made suggestions that would ensure we had a better experience. For an example, we ordered mimosas, and Gus suggested we get the 32 oz because we could refill ours for less money. What a guy! Whenever we come in we will always request one of them. 

Now let's talk about the food! We have thus far gotten crepes, a German pancake with strawberries (tasted basically like a crepe but that's nothing to sneeze at because the crepes were out of this world) crabacado which my boyfriend said were phenomenal, the waffles with bananas, strawberries, blueberries and cream cheese icing which is so good. Today we got again the waffles, and the French toast with triple berry, and I requested cream cheese icing because it was so good. Oh. My. God. It was insanely yummy. Bottom line is if you are looking for a breakfast spot, EAT HERE! Nothing is bad, everything including the service exceeds all expectations."}
{"text":"Well, I wanted to like the place but let me say:service is great, staff is great, ambience is great, coffee is great. I just like to eat healthier and while they did sub egg whites and hold the hollandaise sauce and cheese, it was a little tasteless. They say, if you want Chinese food, go to a Chinese restaurant. If you want healthier fare, go to Good Egg/First watch, or even JJ's or Einstein's where you can adjust the menu. Not many options here. BUT..I will say, for people who want a hearty breakfast, it's tops. Just not for me."}
{"text":"So delicious!! The food was cooked perfectly and it looked like out of a magazine. I requested poached eggs and french toast. The service was also great considering how busy the place was everyone was pleasant. Also liked how supervisors were mindful of helping employees. I am definitely going back since they have a breakfast and lunch menu there is a lot more to try. Keep in mind one entree is large enough for 2 people. 

Coffee outside available while you wait really shows they care about customers."}
{"text":"Our favorite \"go-to\" for breakfast.  We try something new off the menu most times that we visit & have yet to be disappointed.  We love the service & the friendly staff.  It's also nice to see how they appear to enjoy working there & with each other.  It can get crowded, but to me - THAT is a very good sign!  Just plan ahead & go early.  The Northwest influence makes us happy too.  Dungeness crab, Tillamook cheese, Ivar's clam chowder, Snoqualmie Falls oatmeal - just to name a few.  Try it!  You'll like it!!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! We will be back! I recommend the hash browns that have bacon, sour cream and onions mixed in."}
{"text":"Family's favorite breakfast spot.   Solid food and wonderful service.  Waffles and French toast are just what you want.  Kids wolf 'em down.  But what keeps me coming is the service.   Team effort-- whoever has coffee fills your cup when they see it empty.   Thanks, Brooke, for quick service with a smile and more than a few laughs.  

Keep it up folks and we'll keep coming back!

PS --hash browns could use a little work. The potatoes just aren't a flavorful as they could be.  I think you can do better."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, bright energetic art on the walls, great music on...The Talking Heads were playing upon arrival....The food is amazing, my co-diner ordered the German pancake and it was beautiful. I had loaded hashbrowns with poached eggs and bacon...the bacon is so good like home made and the hashbrowns were stellar. They have a great patio section, inside dinning lots of booths and tables."}
{"text":"If you get here at 830 or 9 am expect to wait they do open at 630 though. We waited about 30 minutes this morning what drew us here was the nw crab Benedict . It was good it came w/ bacon and crab poached eggs and a holindaise . Our server/servers were polite and efficient. Looking forward to returning and trying other dishes"}
{"text":"This place was like an old cafeteria my grandfather used to go to. The decor was old and uninviting, which was odd because this place is fairly new. The food was horrible and the service was average at best.
  My daughter had pancakes, bacon and eggs. They forgot the bacon and eggs, no big deal, but when they finally brought them, they were cold, dry and disgusting.  I had the Avacado Benedict, without the hollandaise. It was horrible! The tomatoes were soggy, mushy, and didn't taste the way tomatoes are supposed to taste. The avocado was brown and mushy. It's summer in AZ, no excuse for junky avocados, especially when I had just bought some perfect avocados from the Safeway across the street! The food was cold and didn't taste fresh at all. If this was my restaurant, there is no way I would have let this plate get delivered to a customer. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"German Pancakes are amazing!! Clean eating and gray customer service! Ilona was a great hostess!"}
{"text":"We had high hopes for this restaurant based on the reviews, but it was lackluster... the service was good, but with a ton of people were waiting and we counted 4 dirty tables just by us. They really should have some one bussing the tables to turn them faster. I ordered the German pancake which was really delicious but everything else was bland. Overall, there are much better Gilbert breakfast options and we probably won't be back to this one."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  it is becoming our favorite place to eat breakfast. The dishes are wonderfully flavored.  Vegetables are perfectly cooked  and not soggy. Their breakfast bisquits are wonderful. I highly recommend any of the omelets.  The servers are cheerful and helpful and we are always seated right away. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"All I have done is sit here, like a stooge, for 30 minutes.  The waitress took forever to show her face TO TAKE MY ORDER.  My simple order is Eggs Benedict.   Where O' where is my eggs benedict?

I had to bring the timing, to the attention of 3 employees, while I starved.  Had a side salad first, but it or the waitress was no where to be found

 One of the employees told me there was trouble in the kitchen, what???Arizona, Arizona, don't tell me that lame excuse.  Two people to serve and a eggs benedict takes that long????

They comped my meal but the food is not prepared special or unique, and there is not a lot of it.  The fact I had to speak up drops the stars for you.

The waitress, Debbie was cordial and really seemed to care, after the fact.  Hopefully they improve.  Because that was very painful."}
{"text":"My blender strawberry lemonade was not blended well.  Ice was chunky like crushed ice.  Hash browns were not crispy, chicken fried steak was overly salty and soggy.  Server never asked if everything was ok and never came by to refill our drinks.  Go to IHOP instead."}
{"text":"This place is so good! Got in quick, food was really good. The people who work here are super friendly Micheal and Devon in particular helped us today!!"}
{"text":"Today we had such a great experience here with our server Andy! He was funny and very attentive. The food was also delicious! I definitely recommend coming here and if you do ask for Andy!"}
{"text":"I love breakfast. This is likely somewhat evident through my reviews. This place was new and fairly close to my place and work, so of course I had to check it out. I wasn't disappointed, but it certainly has some room to grow. The service was great! So I'll start with that. Nothing food-wise was bad. It was good. It just wasn't better than Dennys or Village Inn (except for the service!). I'd eat here again if someone wanted to meet here, but I don't think I would choose it on my own. The food wasn't as exciting as it sounded on the menu. There were three of us, and all of us felt the same way, even the person that would eat anything. Hopefully Egg N' Joe gets someone in there to help them with their food, because the hidden location and middle of the road food won't help them get very far."}
{"text":"A quite breakfast with a friend - and wanted someplace where the food was great to go along with great service.  Best of both worlds at Egg N' Joe ... Brooke was wonderful as she took care of us, gave us the space to visit but also ensured we were well cared for.  I had the Hungry Rancher Breakfast - Three farm-fresh eggs, smokehouse bacon, honey-cured ham and country pork sausage links. The Northwest Hash Browns and freshly-baked buttermilk biscuit all paired perfectly!  I must add - I asked for my eggs \"over medium\" - first time in MONTHS that they were actually done right - over medium! Usually they come out over easy. Score!"}
{"text":"We were excited about going to this new breakfast place in Gilbert, The service was good but the food is very pricey based on the quality of the food you get. We ordered a German pancake that was burnt on the outside and not cooked in the middle. We also order the crab benedict and crab omelet. The omelette eggs looked and tasted like powered eggs and the crab is very poor quality canned crab that doesn't even taste like crab. They also need to work out if you pay at the table or upfront as the backup of servers at the front register trying to serve customers who are paying at the table is ridiculous."}
{"text":"The blueberry pancakes are a MUST HAVE! I didn't use syrup (and I ALWAYS use syrup) but I did get some extra butter on the side to basically make it the best blueberry muffin I've ever had. I am a pancake lover and it is very possible these are the best on earth. Just saying. Also it comes with four?!? For the price that's crazy. also recommend the country sausage, it pairs great with the syrup. 

The food in general is really wholesome feeling. I know they aren't cutting corners with ingredients. I can just tell and that's awesome. The pancakes didn't make me feel heavy or dead inside. The eggs were well made and the hash browns tasted higher quality than others somehow? Maybe it's the oil they use?. It's breakfast that doesn't make me feel like taking a nap-- that's a win. 

The northwestern menu theme is done really well. Small things like only using fresh fruit and real maple syrup are a big part of that. The crab is of course the most noticeable part (and my Seattle-born husband loved it!). Also their water is definitely filtered so, yum? I know that's a weird thing to mention but it's nice when the water doesn't distract from the food.  

Servers were nice and prompt. It was super busy but we did still get seated quickly because there was only two of us. We will definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"Love getting breakfast here! Its always busy and haven't had a bad visit. Usually go here during the week. I've tried the get two combo and the lighter chicken fried steak and egg and it was perfect just the right amount. Unlike other places this was the perfect amount of food. So glad it opened in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Fourth visit!!  Terrible service!!   One cup of coffee down and still waiting on food!  Everybody seated after us already have food. Manager spent over 20 minutes talking to a table.  Should have been checking on orders!"}
{"text":"Had great dining experience. Our server Janet is outstanding. 
Will go back again.  Ate the veggie omelet"}
{"text":"Fantastic and much needed 5 star breakfast restaurant in Chandler.  Well done Hope. Staff, food and service all amazing.  Can't wait to try other items on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Clean, delicious food, and excellent service.  Janet is a server who takes care of your every need with a smile."}
{"text":"Egg N' Joe is a wonderful breakfast spot in North Scottsdale featuring some absolutely delicious,  and truly unique breakfast dishes.

I stopped in in to Egg N' Joe for a late Sunday breakfast, arriving around 2 PM. Since we got there later, there was no wait for tables, although a water and coffee station were setup out front for what I assume was a lengthy wait earlier that day. We were quickly sat at a booth towards the back of the restaurant, and a minute or so after being sat, were greeted by our server Tara who would take care of us the rest of the morning. 

Tara briefly walked us through the restaurant concept and their signature dishes before asking what we would like to drink. We ordered a mix of mimosas for the table, sampling both a classic mimosa made with Orange Juice, and their seasonal mimosa made with Pomegranate Juice. While I didn't personally care for the pomegranate mimosa, as it was too sweet for my tastes, the orange juice mimosa was excellent. 

To eat, we ordered 2 German Pancake combos which came with a MASSIVE german pancake (more egg based than flour like your traditional pancake) 2 eggs, and breakfast meats, all for around $12-13. It was an excellent value, and was so much food you'll definitely leave with leftovers. The breakfast was incredibly delicious, and very unique, as I don't know of any other restaurant that sells the German pancakes.

Tara was super helpful throughout our entire meal and was always nearby if we needed refills on drinks.

I will definitely be returning to Egg N' Joe again in the future, and look forward to trying more of what they have to offer."}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast/lunch place that opened right in front of Costco.  All the food we ordered was very good and our waitress was friendly and checked on us often.  We have a dog so we ask every place we go if she can sit on the patio but this restaurant is service dog only, just as a heads up to any dog owners.  But the restaurant is lovely and the menu is pretty diverse!"}
{"text":"This is our go to breakfast place. Food is consistently good. Great value for what you get.  Hubby gets the hungry rancher and I get the veggie omelet, my daughter loves the pancakes. Only downside there is always a wait."}
{"text":"Not bad, first experience was a little rough but they had just opened. Second time was better. Waiters are average and food is good. It is a nice place to go if you are looking for a solid breakfast place. If you are into German pancakes then definitely give it a try. I would say that's the only thing that really sets this place apart from all other breakfast joints."}
{"text":"We went there for breakfast on a Monday Apr 3rd, after a doctor appointment. Was seated very quickly but waiter was very slow to attend, even with coffee and tea order. I had to call for someone' attention for service. Had a club sandwich which was outstanding.It was a huge sandwich, fresh with crispy delicious bacon. My husband is in the food business and he even agreed the meal was good, fresh and quick to be served."}
{"text":"Best breakfast joint in Scottsdale.  We loved our server, Tara.  She appeared to freshen our drinks before we even knew they needed it.  Breakfast was yummy--four of us sampled different items and loved each one.  The puffed german pancakes and potato pancakes are amazing.  It's a busy place--go early or late if you dislike waiting."}
{"text":"Minus a star for long wait time and trouble finding parking. 4 stars for the staff being so courteous. There was complimentary water and coffee to those waiting to be seated today. Prices were reasonable everything seemed to stay under 15 dollars. The iced tea tasted fresh and was very refreshing. My daughter had mac and cheese and banana slices and I had the country fried steak and eggs. Delicious. Everything was fresh and cooked perfect. My daughter and I were very happy with our meals and the waitresses were very good with my shy toddler. I would visit again."}
{"text":"I went to Egg and Joe. I waited 15 minutes until I got seated which was ok. Once I was seated the waitress got my girlfriend and I drinks, after that the waitress did not come back for a while. She would ask others how they were doing and avoid our table. The waitress was not a great listener, I asked her for 2 more syrups and just brought one. The whole time of being there the waitress would basically keep disappearing. It was rude when the lady would check a table next to us and get them refills when my girlfriend and I needed refills but she wouldn't come to our table. If you go to egg and joe know that there's a chance that you will get awful and rude service like we did"}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this restaurant since its opening and this past Friday I got the chance. The resturant is very clean and the staff is very friendly. The food is excellent! The place was packed at 9:30 am! I'm definitely going back!"}
{"text":"This was the best breakfast I've had in a while! The service was awesome! We never had an empty drink and our food was perfect! The German pancake is a must try! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service is exceptional!
Pancakes and French toast are awesome!
Must have fish and chips. Batter is perfection! Great place to enjoy breakfast or lunch with family"}
{"text":"4 out of 5 because eventhough the food was great, the waitress failed to gave us more napkins twice!"}
{"text":"Meh. OK. Service was slow. Food was just ok. Judging by the amount of traffic I thought it would be a much better experience. It was no different than Denny's. And it was really expensive, $55  for three of us and that didn't include bloody Mary's, they don't serve alcohol"}
{"text":"The food here is good, can't complain about that. Dutch pancake was flaky and chewy and the Benedict hollandaise seemed like it was from scratch. Here's my issue, no espresso! Why?!? Invested in an espresso machine and charge me $5 I'll pay it! This is my biggest pet peeve. I'm not going out for breakfast if I have to go somewhere else for a latte."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome with lots of friendly people and staff.  Will be back when we go to cave creek"}
{"text":"This lovely little breakfast/ lunch restaurant just opened and yet you would never know it. The atmosphere is cheerful and and inviting. Our server, Michelle, was sweet, friendly and attentive. I loved the Denver omelette and my husband's German pancake combo left a big smile on his face."}
{"text":"I have had breakfast at Egg n Joe's 3 times so far and have tried different items on the menu each time and have been really pleased with my selections which include German pancakes, avocado Benedict and sun devil skillet.  It is a brand new establishment with a lot of kinks still being worked on so they deserve some grace. The time between ordering and food to the table definitely needs more attention as well as the temperature of the dish being served. My most recent dish was lukewarm on my first bite and got cold rather quickly.  I think we would have been able to enjoy the food more had it been nice and hot. Our server also seemed little frazzled.  We only saw her twice during the 75 min stay.  But as I mentioned, I know they are working out their kinks and I have high hopes for this restaurant.  Everyone in this area knows how we needed a great breakfast place.. We are counting on you, Egg n Joe's to be the best in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place was great!!! The service was the best part, but don't get me wrong, the food is amazing, too. I'd recommend the triple berry pancakes!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying my husband and I love brunch and we have tried just about every brunch place in the Phoenix metro area. We're always looking for our next favorite spot! That being said egg n' joe didn't even come close to making that cut. I might have had the worst breakfast experience I've ever had at the egg n' joe. I ordered one of the Benedicts and asked for my eggs to be poached medium (with a runny center but cooked whites). When my food came out they were cooked all the way through. I asked the waiter who dropped off the food to please have the kitchen make me two new eggs that are runny on the inside because I do not like poached hard eggs. He was very kind and said yes of course. He brings my food back out and the eggs are cooked through even more than they were the first time. I was not mad when it came out wrong the first time I understand mistakes happen and everybody deserves a second chance, but for me to ask for my food a certain way twice and still not get what I ordered really put me over the off. On top of my order being wrong my husbands scrambled eggs were the driest eggs I've ever seen and looked like egg shavings. The chicken sausage however was delicious. The manager did come over and apologize and gave us a free meal for next time, but unfortunately there won't be a next time. I can remember our waitresses name but she was very kind and polite. Staff was friendly but there is obvious miscommunication between the staff and kitchen and kitchen could probably take a few cooking lessons to get something as simple as scrambled eggs so wrong."}
{"text":"Meh. This looked like a fancy place that would be more like First Watch or Egg and I. 

It's more like Denny's."}
{"text":"Visited Sunday 1/31/16. 

Bright space with nice friendly people. 

Atmosphere was spoiled by air conditioning blowing on our table. Temperature outside was about 55 degrees. 

When the temperature was mentioned to waitress she stated that it felt good to her. I then stated it was uncomfortable and her reply was \"Well you can't please everybody\". My response was \"you could start with the customer\".

That issue was not resolved since the comment was ignored. 

Food was good and very abundant.  However, pricing was very, very high!  Plus $30 (before tip).  

We may go back but it is not high on our list.  Repeat - food was quite good. Lacked any concern for customer."}
{"text":"Only have time for a quick review. Prompt courteous staff, very clean dining area. Tara was an excellent server. Had the avocado eggs benedict - tasty! From where I was seated I could see the servers, manager and cook staff interacting. They seem to work well as a team. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to try out Egg N' Joe for breakfast today, even though it was a Sunday!!  
The wait was 15 minutes, as they said it would be....a good start to me! 
Service was excellent, the staff is very well trained on how to treat customers.
I had the Eggs benedict with Dungeness crab, and the crab tasted very fresh.  Plenty of coffee refills, and the food came in without too long of a wait. And,t he coffee was excellent!
They said they are the first location here (with this name) from a great restaurant in Oregon - \"Elmer's\" which I used to go to when I would go home for a visit with family.  
Will be back there, the manager said to try the German pancakes, that is one of their signature dishes....will do that!  
The only negative....I wish they would have enclosed the high ceiling more in order to reduce the noise level, but I'm not going to ding them on what the developer has done."}
{"text":"The Potato Cakes were 5-stars!!!  Mimosas were great. the food was good.  Service was a little less than stellar.  Our Server forgot to put in an order of the German pancakes...the portions are plenty big....so it was not missed to much.

We will try this place again when in the area. worth checking out...and if you do...GET THE POTATO CAKES LOADED!"}
{"text":"This place was by far one of the best breakfast meals I've had in a long time. New and very busy, we didn't have to wait too long for a table. The food was delicious, portions huge, and prices inexpensive. I had the seasonal fruit waffle and it was the lightest crispiest waffle ever. Piled high with tons of berries and cream cheese icing it was amazing. It also came with eggs and a choice of breakfast meat. My mom had a southwestern omelete which they made as a scramble per request. She loved it. The service was a little slow but they were busy and still pretty new so I attribute that to working out the kinks. Definitely coming back here again."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place one more time. Horrible. Slow service again, I tried pancakes this time. They were alright, my eggs were undercooked so I didn't bother. This place is on my do not eat at list haha. Second chance, bye."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite breakfast place in town.  Good food and friendly atmosphere. A special shout out to our favorite waitress C. She is a character and makes the visit such fun. Hard worker and a pleasure for sure!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I'm quite impressed not only with the food but the service.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's basically Denny's.  Nothing fancy or amazing but it's OK

I'm being prompted to add more content as Yelp is telling me my review is too short.  Since I can't think of any more positive or negative remarks on this average establishment, I'll see if this additional paragraph makes Yelp happy.

I had to come back and add more to my review as I sit here eating and read through the other reviews.. particularly all the 5 star reviews. Now, this place is not horrible by any means but it is far from the best breakfast anywhere as several suggest. If you dine out regularly in the Gilbert area you know that. I suspect there are some extremely sheltered food patrons or fake reviews. Come in and judge for yourself if your good with an IHOP / Denny's experience."}
{"text":"Finally had occasion to stop here.  Overall reviews are good, so we have wanted to try this for a while.

Mostly a standard breakfast menu.  But there were a few items that seemed interesting.  We ordered the sundevil chorizo skillet, and the German pancake.

The chorizo skillet was pretty much what I expected. Chorizo, hash browns, scrambled egg, salsa.  I had them hold the sour cream.  It was good.  Comparable to skillets I've had elsewhere.

The German pancake is interesting.  If you look it up on the internet you find the recipe seems to involve a LOT of eggs, and the finished product is more like a crepe than a puffy pancake that most of us are familiar with.  It is served with butter and lemon. Just for me I might replace the lemon with something else, but it was still good.  Definitely a different flavor than a \"normal\" pancake.  It did come with egg and bacon.  The bacon was sorta dry.  I think they overcooked it.

Portion sizes were respectable.  Service was friendly but slightly inattentive.  Fortunately we didn't need anything after food delivery, but I was just about to get up and ask for the check when she finally came back and asked if we were done.  One plus was that a manager did check on us once to see if we liked the food.

Overall, this place is good.  I've been to a couple of 5-star breakfast places, and this isn't up to that.  But it's good.  Definitely better than 3-star."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  Wife had the peach/blueberry crepes, I had the hungry rancher which is three rags, three meats, and one of the best biscuits I have ever had.  They are busy and worth the wait it takes to get such great food to your table.  Come hungry and enjoy the ride."}
{"text":"We went to Egg N' Joe for our son's birthday brunch. We were seated promptly. It was a beautiful day so we were able to sit outside on the patio. Our waitress was excellent the entire time. We all ordered breakfast and everything was very good. My husband loved his usual \"chicken fried steak.\" I had the Swedish pancakes which were delicious. The pieces of bacon were crispy and a good size. The kids loved their food also. Our experience was great and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very expensive. $32 for 2 times! Not very good.  Long wait, 40 minutes and 30 minutes too get the food.  Bacon was over done, dried out, hash browns were crap,  Denver omlet had little or no ham.  Not the best food for that price.  Good service, but won't be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast at Egg'NJoe. We shared the Sun Devil Skillet & their amazing Bagel Benedict. Our server Janet did a great job keeping us full of coffee. The mimosa added a bit of fun to our experience. Job well done. Thank you'"}
{"text":"I decided to give this restaurant another chance since we are
creatures of habit, and this is where our friends like to go.
This time the restaurant was not crowded and we were seated
almost immediately.  Good start.  I can't figure out if the problem
is with the chefs or with the wait staff. Once again we were told the
restaurant ran out of silverware, but we should have some before our
food came.  This meant I had nothing to stir my coffee with, and we all joked that maybe we should bring our own silverware next time. Our food came out minus our toast (again), and we had to ask for it. This is really obnoxious for me as I order my eggs over easy and want to dip the bread in while my eggs are hot.  After a second reminder in a 4 minute time frame we received 2 sets of wheat toast, unfortunately, we ordered
rye.  We were afraid to give the bread back as we didn't know how
long it would take to get more, so we ate the bread neither one of us had asked for.   This is 3 weeks in a row that our toast was not delivered with our hot eggs.  No silverware, and No toast did it for me, I'm done.  After coming to this restaurant every Sunday almost 9 weeks straight, we have decided to try something else next week-end."}
{"text":"My husband and I are here for breakfast today. I ordered classic eggs Benedict with hash browns loaded, and coffee. My hubby ordered lumber jack meal with coffee as well. The coffee was a bit on the strong side for me. My husband's biscuit was soft & delicious! The service was great."}
{"text":"I want to start by saying I've never wrote a review because places don't typically disappoint me. as I'm not a vert picky eater. This is basically along the lines of Denny's/ihop (I'd go there before this) The biscuits are canned Pillsbury. The eggs the Omelette are wrapped in are about the thickness of paper and dry and don't even appear appealing. The pancakes taste like bisquick. I won't be back they are capitalizing on the location and making themselves seem like a really home cooked cafe style establishment,and that it is not."}
{"text":"Went to Egg N' Joe for the first time recently and was anything but impressed. The food was mediocre at best and nothing you couldn't get from you local Denny's or other chain restaurants . The bigger disappointment came when we waited over 20 minutes to get our food just to find out that they got our order wrong along with completely forgetting to put one our items in at all. They did openly admit to forgetting one of our items and did take care of one of our meals for us, but we will not be looking to return any time soon."}
{"text":"Clean, bright atmosphere with friendly service.  Lovely location in N. Scottsdale with pretty mountain view.

My grandson loved his waffles and I enjoyed the lingonberry crepes.  Good coffee with frequent refills.   

Got us off to a good start for a Sunday morning.  Best of all...... The price was very reasonable.   $15 for the two of us.....not bad!"}
{"text":"Cool venue. Based out of the Northwest. Outdoor patio is nice and menu selections are very good. Ample parking and be prepared to wit on the weekends; well attended.

{"text":"Great food and the service is outstanding.  Don't go on weekends unless you want to wait an hour."}
{"text":"Great food, Amazing service, and wonderful people.  Now we just need Bloody Mary's."}
{"text":"The other day I tried ordering a to go order from this place. 
First off it took them way too long to answer. When the lady finally answered she had an attitude, naturally I blew it off then the call was disconnected and I called back (which took way longer than the first time) and she stilll had attitude and when I said I'd like to place a to go order she acted like I was asking for the whole kitchen or something. So I decided to not come I'm a costumer you shouldn't be treating your costumers like that. 
Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! Loved the potato cakes. Thanks Tara for the great service! We'll definitely be back to this location."}
{"text":"Return date 6/30/2018 and happy to report another successful group breakfast. Quick courteous service, good food and so accommodating! We regularly run into problems with the size of our Club events and again that wasn't the case at Egg & Joe. In fact they actually brought in extra wait and kitchen staff to insure another good experience. We will be back (again)  Thank-you Pinnacle Peak Scottsdale location."}

Good Place

{"text":"This was our first time coming to egg n joe and the food was pretty good! Everything came out quickly and the restaurant was very clean. Our server (Scott, I think) was very attentive and nice. He was patient and made great suggestions."}
{"text":"The german pancake is awesome here! It is one of my favorite breakfast dishes, so when I really wanted one we tried this place. The wait was pretty long but coffee is provided outside. The server was very nice and friendly, too. I didn't try the eggs or joe, but I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this new Restaurant!  The general manager remembers me every time, and I've only been there three times.  They have fast service, always polite, kind and friendly.  Clean restaurant, bathrooms and a great location.  I get the Avocado Eggs Benedict, they are fabulous!"}
{"text":"Just finishing up breakfast right now. Had to wait 45 minutes to sit down. My fiancé ordered a mimosa and it had A LOT of OJ. Anyone who drinks mimosas knows a great mimosa has a splash of OJ. My fiancé asked our server Ilona to fix the drink and she continued to argue with us. She even went as far as bringing out a measuring cup to show us she had the drink correctly, very rude. Then she came back to the table and said maybe my fiancé didn't know what he was talking about because he was still drunk from last night, again very rude. When our food came out my eggs Benedict was just warm not hot, making me think my dish was waiting in the window for 5-10minutes. Needless to say I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the service above and beyond! Shout out to Tara who is the absolute best!!!
I order the Crabocado which is a 3 egg omelette with Crab and Avocado, Swiss cheese and hollandaise sauce. Very very good!!
Hubby loves the biscuits with sausage gravy. Or he will order the Ham and Tillimook omelette. 
We showed up about 11:11 on a Sunday after church and we were seated immediately (despite requesting Tara!). 
The inside is bright with lots of seating. There is patio seating available and they have misters for warm weather and heaters for winter.
We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I am addicted.   If you get the hashbrowns get them with the works.  Actually there should be no \"if\". You want these dang hashbrowns!  You NEED these hashbrowns in your life.

This is my favorite place to eat in Gilbert.

I've only had the eggs and bacon with the hashbrowns and hotcakes but I don't see myself changing that order anytime soon.  Comes with a perfect biscuit.

Coffee is excellent, service is flawless.

On a day off from work, I ride my bike here and I'm in my happy place.

Super bummed I had the flu on my birthday last Sunday because Egg n Joe breakfast was going to be my birthday gift to myself.

Probably getting some Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Ambiance: A bustling modern brunch diner. Bright colors and lots of natural light. Perfect way to start your morning. Definitely not your typical family owned brunch restaurant that caters to retirees. Moderate sized patio as well. Noise level is high but goes well with the bustling brunch atmosphere. Patrons are all ages with lots of families.

Food:  Their unique offering is the German pancake which is a must try (probably best to split between two as they're HUGH). The subtle sweetness of the batter mixes well with the butter and sour lemon twist. You can add fruit for extra but it's not necessary. The have an extensive breakfast menu which should satisfy most. The eggs Benedict with avocado was ok, nothing to write home about. 

Service: There's usually a 10-20 minute wait on weekends. Both times we went we were waited on by Ethan, who you can tell really cares to take care of his customers even in the mist of how crazy busy this place is.

Price: Very reasonable 

Overall: A solid brunch spot! Definitely stop by and try the German Pancake!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch and had the sundevil skillet which was scrumptious... biscuits were also tasty.. we ordered the German pancake and was not very good and def not worth $10.. it tasted like a knock off funnel cake.. just ur avg brunch restaurant #notimpressed.... good but not great"}
{"text":"I had the caramel apple german pancake/dutch baby and the pancake itself was good but I was very disappointed by the topping. The dutch baby, though it is big, is really like a crepe minus the filling... that's why the topping ratio is relevant. 

There were only a a few pieces of apple (maybe a quarter of a cup) and the caramel, I was told by our server, gets mixed in when they are being warmed -- rendering it hardly evident. 

Fortunately, our server offered to bring a side of the caramel, which was more than enough and definitely improved the overall dish.  

I liked the coffee cup better than the coffee... but it was drinkable.

There was a wait (10AM on a Saturday morning) without a lot of indoor waiting space. It was drizzly, so the patio was closed. Don't know that there would've been a wait at that time if the patio had been open.

Not a bad option for breakfast in north Scottsdale... but, not  really worth the drive from central Phoenix either."}
{"text":"I have given Egg N' Joe the benefit of the doubt and visited a few times before deciding today to NOT go again.  I must say the consistency at this place is horrible.  One day you can have a good german pancake and the following 4 times a bad experience.  Today I ordered the German pancake to again hear them say sorry we ran out.  So I switched to a crepe that was very dry and lacking any flavor.  When I mentioned to the server she was what do you want me to do????  I guess when you serve a dry bad dish you might want to say sorry, can I get you something else but when your server forgets to come back until she gives you the check what can you expect!!

If you are looking for pancakes go someplace else."}
{"text":"Clean, nice decor, friendly and attentive staff and great food.   Nothing could be improved on.   I would definitely come back here next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We arrived during a very busy time and our order was delayed.  Our waitress Jan, was amazing!!  Customer service was superb and they went so far as to comp my breakfast!!  We will definitely be back!  Great food!"}
{"text":"New, nicely decorated restaurant, with very \"AVERAGE\" food.  People are nice but the service is slow.  There are better places - I won't return."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in and try this breakfast place. Well to my surprise it's very cute on the inside and the customer service is outstanding. I would definitely recommend trying this place out. The food is very good. 

Our wait time to be seated was less than 5 minutes,  waiters came to the table promptly and took our drink orders,  coffee was great,  food came in a timely manner and my boyfriend mentioned to one of the waitresses how great the customer service was and we received a coupon for $10 off your next meal with them. 

We will definitely be returning for lunch or dinner. Keep up the great work everyone!"}
{"text":"Just no! 
My husband and I gave this place a second attempt after a so-so first experience. We were excited to have a new breakfast spot less than 2 miles from our home. 
Needless to say, the whole experience was disappointing. Our server was overwhelmed, even though it was hardly busy. She kept forgetting little things like cream for the coffee or ketchup for the table. She kept topping off my hubby's coffee even though he said multiple times he didn't need any more. 
I ordered eggs and sausage breakfast wth hash browns and a biscuit. It's pretty sad when the biscuit is the best thing on the plate. The sausage links were cold, the hash browns greasy, and the eggs lukewarm. 
I really wanted to like this place, but It's really bad!"}
{"text":"Long wait, Okay food, terrible coffee! If you have \"Joe\" in your name, you should have a decent coffee menu. I ordered a coffee drink that was so sweet I couldn't even drink it. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was phenomenal. Highly recommend the German pancakes. But even greater than the food was the service. Due to a mistake in the kitchen our food came a little late and they were so apologetic and told us exactly what was going on. We will definitely be back and will take all of our friends and family with us."}
{"text":"Got there 11:30AM on a Sat..waited 20 mins for table. Ordered blueberry pancakes with NO powdered sugar, and a side of bacon. Food came out in another 20 minutes. My mother ordered a basic club sandwich.
Pancakes came out loaded with sugar. Server told me to eat that bacon and she'd get me another order without the sugar right away.  I was starving so ate most of the bacon, then in almost 20 minutes out came the blueberry pancakes with a SKIMPY amount of blueberries. So I got to eat my bacon first, and skimpy blueberry pancakes 20 minutes later. Meanwhile my mother finished her mediocre/dry sandwich. I will try them one more time as they are new but that's it. Underwhelmed and fairly annoyed. They appear to need a manager to deal with customer service issues, not a busy/disinterested server."}
{"text":"One of our favs for the family! Always have great service, great food and the prices are good! The $13 pitchers of mimosas don't hurt either"}
{"text":"I hate to give places under 4 stars, but Egg N' Joe really did not wow me! I had been wanting to go here for months and finally tried it out last week. After seeing pictures of the German pancake, I got excited, assuming all of the portions would be quite big, unfortunately this was not the case. That is my main complaint, tiny portions. At least for what I ordered. I got the garden vegetable skillet with egg whites and no cheese, assuming it would be enough to fill me up, or at least I'd get a larger side or something. My skillet was so tiny! Even everyone who I was eating with commented that my skillet looked small! It did taste pretty good, I liked all the vegetables in it and the hash browns. It was not incredible but not too bad. The biscuit was yummy too. There was just not enough to fill me up. I asked to look at the menu again, planning to order a side but there was no side menu apparently? So I just went and got a snack somewhere else haha.
Also our server was very sweet but forgot a couple people's things here and there. But she didn't do a bad job or anything, we were pleased.
This place is good for light eaters I think. When I go out to eat I want to have a ton of food, so I left a little disappointed, but it was not bad. I like how there is an open feel in the restaurant with all of the big windows, the location is nice. I would agree to go back and order something else, but I'm not quite rushing back!"}
{"text":"Food took forever to come out and everything had no flavor.  Also the servers \"joking around\" with my kid got to the point where it seemed to turn into picking and being aggressive.  Too bad, I was excited to try it,  won't be coming back."}
{"text":"yummy german pancake! me and my husband went there for breakfast and got an omelet and german pancake. i've been trying to find somewhere with good german pancakes and this place did it! loved it and great price. can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"First time there. Horrible experience. I didn't mind the 30 min. wait for a table (it was Sunday brunch so I get it, it's going to be packed). But after sitting down and our waiter taking our order for two, another 30mins. goes by and you start to see other customers being serviced who came in after you, you start to wonder what's up.  Our waiter finally comes back stating the kitchen lost our order but they have it now.  No manger came by to apologize for the experience, no mention of compensation to our ticket. Nothing but a question from our waiter wanting to know if we wanted anything else. Not a good sign. I'll take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"I went to get some breakfast today and was sorely disappointed in the quality of food. I'm a little shocked how flavorless everything was. I ordered the ranch breakfast which came with a biscuit, hash browns, bacon, and scrambled eggs. The only thing that had flavor was obviously the bacon. Every other item I had to douse with some sort of sauce.The eggs needed hot sauce, the disgusting grease-flavored hash browns needed ketchup, and the biscuit required honey in order to swallow. It was about $11 for that. I would say don't waste your money."}
{"text":"There OK for breakfast the place is nice and clean the service is really good but I like to go to places that gives better choices healthy choices"}
{"text":"I would have loved for this to be a better experience. Came in because I was craving eggs Benedict and they had some with Dungeness crab. Unfortunately the first time the eggs were over cooked. The second time the eggs were undercooked. The THIRD time the eggs were perfect but the hash browns were cold. Next time I will go to Snooze where they get things right. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and service. Love that they have coffee and water out for waiting guests. Wish there was a bit more shade to wait in."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and while I've never been disappointed with my breakfast I've never been enthusiastic about it either.  It's been consistently well cooked and consistently good.  It's like the breakfast your Grandma makes you, well cooked but nothing fancy.

Today I had the ranch breakfast sans eggs.  Hash browns, biscuit (undercooked) bacon and ham.  The service was friendly.  The restaurant is always busy.  The women's restroom was not well maintained and not very clean.

All in all it was a pretty ok breakfast, nothing creative or very flavorful."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is awesome (especially the German pancake). The decor is so cute. My only complaint is the restaurant is so small and there is always a wait.  I'm moving back to the Phoenix area soon and will definitely miss this gem of a restaurant.  I hope more locations will open soon."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day. It was busy but we were seated quickly. The food was great, my 5 year old loved his and mine. We had excellent service and will definitely want to come back again. They also have a nice outdoor section as well."}
{"text":"Was in the area recently and hungry for a good breakfast.  My omelette tasted fresh and the hash browns were crispy.  The service was also excellent waitress kept our coffee cups and water filled during our visit.  Hats off to the staff there!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast spot. The German pancake is usually great but this time it tasted like it had been pre-made and had been sitting a while despite the wait.. The one other disappointment is that they have chosen to serve Pepsi products (presumably to save money) instead of serving Coca Cola. For that reason mostly they get four stars instead of five."}
{"text":"Love it! Great coffee, good food, nice ambiance, caring staff and generous portions! Can be a lil pricey but you do get your money's worth. Good place to meet for business or catching up with friends. Coffee is STRONG  so if you're like me and need sugar n cream ask for extra. Love the Pacific Northwest menu items they give a nod n a wink to Tillamook so yummy! Gets busy around 9-10 am so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Went to the \"new\" Chandler location for the first time. It was a holiday weekend but the wait was not as long as we anticipated. Once seated the server promptly took our order and delivered drinks. Within a reasonable wait time we received our breakfast. The food was hot and cooked to order. In my recent experience sometimes a breakfast out can be disappointing, this was not. We'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I visited Egg N Joe with my kids on a Sunday morning.  I really want to find a breakfast spot that \"wows\" me.  This wasn't it.  It was just ok.  Our server Spencer, was polite and efficient but the food left me feeling let down."}
{"text":"I really like this place for breakfast on the weekends! I've tried the German pancake (although it is good, I probably won't order it again. I found it to be somewhat bland). My go-to is the Potato Pancake with Tillamook cheese. Delicious!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this place out. Unimpressed, I wouldn't even say that it is a glorified Denny's. Food was mediocre at best, service was fine, atmosphere, well there really isn't one. Have to pay for refills of fountain drinks,I would say if there is a wait it really isn't worth it. I don't think we will be returning."}
{"text":"I really really really wanted to like this place, since they have such great reviews.. but after our breakfast there I WILL DEFINITELY NOT GO BACK.

Staff was kind, not too attentive, wait wasn't long, no one really had any kind of personality though. 

Our server took a minute to greet us, with a toddler we were ready to get the show on the road! We sat in the very last booth right next to the expo line. Boy, I regret sitting there.

1) I watched food sit up there getting cold while NO ONE would run them to tables and the expo herself just stood back there chatting, instead of setting up and handing off food to servers.
2) I watched as a server, \"A\" asked for boiled eggs for a table and as it came up on the expo line, server \"A\" took her dirty hand and \"felt\" the egg, I'm assuming to see if it was hot enough...
3) I watched server \"J\" grab a plate of food and dropped it onto the table and spilled everywhere. I watched as the sausages rolled around and the scrambled eggs just splatter. I THEN WATCHED AS EXPO AND SERVER \"J\" with his bare hands pick back up the food and replate it onto a new plate!! I even managed to get a picture of it.. definitely against health code. [ I am sure this happens alot in restaurants,  but seeing it happen is a whole different thing]
4) We asked for no tomatoes on one of our Benedicts... and while inspecting it, there wasn't a tomato on it, just the juices and seeds from the tomato that was taken off...[Allergic to tomatoes] I am pretty sure his Benedict got sent to the table behind us since it was tomatoless..

All in all food wasn't too bad, but nothing special either."}
{"text":"We are new residents of Scottsdale, & this was our first visit. When my husband read the reviews & said Egg N' Joe was owned by the same company as Elmer's in Palm Springs, that was the place to go. The menu is extensive & amazing. So many delicious choices. Our server, Tara, was super sweet & helpful. We ordered & our food came out quickly. My husband's breakfast burrito was huge, & he said it was excellent. My omelet with Dungeness crab, Swiss cheese, tomato, & hollandaise sauce was melt in your mouth yummy. I had casually mentioned to Tara that it was my husband's birthday. Towards the end of our meal Tara brought over this outrageous pile of pancakes piled high with whipped cream, plus a Happy Birthday card signed by the staff. What a terrific & thoughtful surprise! To top it all off, a young woman came over & introduced herself as Shawna. She said \"Happy Birthday\" & welcomed us to the restaurant. Turns out she is the manager. We had to tell her how impressed we are with her restaurant, thanked her, & said that we would be regulars. We definitely will be!"}
{"text":"Good but not great.   The atmosphere is nice, think Snooze AM in a strip mall.  The omelets and pancakes are good but the hash browns and coffee below par.  The fresh fruit was very good.  Try it for yourself but it won't be my first choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"When you come you must have the German pancake. I had the women and it was absolutely amazing. One of the best things I've ever eaten"}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast!!  Was looking for locals place with good ratings and was not disappointed. When we walked in the place was busy and thought yep we found the right restaurant The food was outstanding and completely prepared the way we like it   Brooke our waitress was so very friendly with a great personality, made us feel like locals. If looking for a breakfast place this would be it!!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place ever since I learned about their\"German pancakes.\" They look like what I know of a Dutch Baby. I dragged my husband there, who'd never had one before, and we both loved them! He got the German pancake with the caramel apple on top. They were generous with the topping, and the topping was very flavorful. I had just powdered sugar and butter on mine, and then the lingonberry butter on the side, so I could enjoy some of it with that, and some with maple syrup. Both options were delicious on it. I also ordered a side of bacon, and it was cooked perfectly. My husband got scrambled eggs with cheese and their chicken and something sausage as part of the combo. He really enjoyed the sausage. That said... I would not get the side or a combo in the future, because it was more food than either of us could eat. I knew the pancakes would be large, but I still underestimated them/overestimated my appetite. It was a bit of a drive for us, but I'd definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Wow, what an incredible place! We tried this place for lunch. The service was wonderful. The Ashley's are so nice. The food was super yummy. Both my daughters got soup and a sandwich. I got the fish and chips. All the food was perfect. We will definitely be returning. It's rare to find a place with such great service."}
{"text":"This breakfast place definitely reminds me of your average breakfast place that serves the usual items with their unique twists. They do serve a special German Pancake that is very delicious and definitely worth a try if you visit this place. Portion size is pretty large. I usually leave with left-overs. The food is good and they do offer substitutions such as egg white, fruit instead of potatoes, etc, which is important especially those with special dietary requirements. The employees are always very nice, helpful, and quick. There is usually a wait during peak hours but any other time, service is relatively quick. It's very family friendly. I've been here and observed families with kids leave their table with trash everywhere on the ground. The staff does a good job at cleaning and sweeping the area before seating new customers. I would have to say the food and facility is pretty average but the whole experience gives it 4 stars."}
{"text":"German pancakes!  Other than that, it's a pretty standard breakfast menu."}
{"text":"We thought the food was good & fresh. The server was nice, but not very attentive. The iced tea tastes a little dirty so I would order a different drink next time. We tried a German pancake and it was delicious!  The biscuits & gravy were really good and they have nice thick bacon."}
{"text":"I stopped by Egg N' Joe for breakfast on a recent weekday morning... 
The bright signage and new shopping center looked appealing; I love trying out new places.

It definitely felt like a chain, and I learned after a bit of research, that it ENJ is indeed a new concept from the Elmer's restaurant group.  While I've never eaten at an Elmer's before, I would guess that my experience at Egg N' Joe pretty much reflects that of an Elmer's.

That being said, I had a positive experience... 

Here are the pros:
*Chris, my server, was friendly and mostly attentive
*Coffee was decent
*Bathrooms were clean
*Prices were moderate
*They have free wifi

I agree with a few of the other reviews that this place reminds me a lot of a Denny's or IHOP.  The food was fine but not anything to write home about.  My omelette felt processed, unlike when I order from locally owned businesses that use local products.  It was fine, but nothing to rush back for.

If I do return, I'd splurge and go for the German pancake, and I'd keep my expectations in check as well.  This is a place to go for a consistent meal, but I wouldn't suggest it if you're planning on wowing your dining companion(s) or enjoying anything out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"Great Bacon!!!!!! BACON!!!!!!!
That would be enough of a review in itself, the food is good, everything I've had so far has been excellent.
Good food, a bit upscale on pricing but at least there haven't been any ghetto style kids (running, screaming, yelling with no parental intervention) when I have visited, maybe the business puts an end to it...
Nice relaxing meal, and awesome Bacon!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is great. Our server was so sweet and attentive. Food is average and a bit pricey for what you get. No I didn't have the German pancake and maybe that's my problem. I had the regular breakfast meal and nothing stuck out. Lunch is mediocre. BLTA (BLT with added avocado) is fine. When I'm feeling like making a poor life decision I'll go back and try the darn German pancake. Will not be back for normal breakfast or lunch though."}
{"text":"Came here on Christmas morning with my family and had the Dungeness crab egg Benedict and it was deeeeeeeliciooous. All the servers were kind and had great sense of urgency. Service was tip top, never once did I ask for my drink to be refilled. The German pancakes were a delicacy that's a must try. Everyone's order was correct, and tasted great. I would definitely come here again regardless of the drive. Chef Val and our server Andre are very friendly and generous which made our overall experience unforgettable this Christmas."}
{"text":"Execellent Breakfast!  Delicious Food! Great service and very clean.  They go above and beyond to serve creative omelettes, waffles, crepes and french toast along with many other items on the menu. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"}
{"text":"Very poor service, mediocre food, over priced. Not going back there. Went there last Saturday, not sure if it was too many people with not enough servers. Also they were using  pre made omelettes - no substitutions possible, \"it comes like that\" is what our waitress said.

Go to Denny's, save some money."}
{"text":"So tasty and super fast service!! I recommend doing call ahead seating though because the wait can get pretty long"}
{"text":"Have eaten here on several occasions and the food was decent.  I always order the german pancake. Today they must  have had an off day because the german pancake was a floppy luke warm blob. My wife ordered poached eggs medium and they showed up almost hard boiled. She also ordered crepes that turned out good and the bacon was excellent. The manager offered to have a new one made after attempting to say that's how all german pancakes look ( not correct)  but due to time constraints I had to turn it down."}
{"text":"My husband and I had a ridiculous craving for some good old fashion  breakfast... we decided to go some place local!!

Eggs n Joe was ideal. We got seated immediately. As  you walk in an adorable hostess seated us at the patio area. The sun was shining,the skies were blue and we were starving.... 

Our waitress Angelina was great. She guided us through the many options.  

The menu was a simple read.  Everything looked good...I mean everything .....We decided on the famous German pancakes and the Daily which is eggs, meat (bacon or chicken sausage) hash browns or seasonal fruit. 

The coffee wasnt the best but they made up for it in the equalityof the food.  I had the perfect scrambled egg white, three slices of beautifully thick bacon and to my surprise a homemade biscuit.  Which by the way was the best biscuit I have ever had.  

The German pancake was like an eromous tire.  It was so light and airy like a crepe. It was DELICIOUS......

I couldnt believe when I looked down at my plate everything was done!!!! 

I love breakfast so this will definitely be my go to place AGAIN AND AGAIN....."}
{"text":"Had brunch with a friend here a few weeks ago.  Very clean place, friendly, FAST staff.  We were immediately seated and drinks quickly followed.  The food was excellent, prepared exactly as requested, and quickly consumed.  We're moving to the area so I'm thrilled to have already found a breakfast place to my liking."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place! Eggs Benedict are sooo good!cool vibe, cool atmosphere and good food!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to egg n joe for breakfast and we were disappointed because we waited around once seated for our waitress, and she finally came to get our order, and she seemed to be busy with other things because she couldn't get the order right. 
The food was cold, and not how I asked... I made a comment about how I was disappointed and she apologized but didn't offer to make it right. 
I was not pleased with the food either, for it was bland and mediocre."}
{"text":"The service here was horrendous. The food was subpar. And it took 30 minutes to get out breakfast dish. We arrived at 645 did not leave until 740 and I had to eat my food in 10 minutes because I didn't receive it until 730. The waitress acted annoyed with every request we made. I stepped outside to take a business phone call, when I came back my son was upset because the waitress was acting annoyed with him and he was feeling bad. I asked him what he  asked for and he just said a cup of soup. Sides that it is a very limited menu, the eggs were cooked right, and the server never checked on us after she dropped our food."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday morning about 9:30am, expecting a wait based on reviews and comments I've seen on the Living Chandler Facebook page.  We checked in, was given one of those light-up contraptions and we headed outside to wait.  We were told it would be about 30 minutes and after about 15, our thingy lit up.  We were escorted to one of the booths (there was four of us) and given menus and asked about drinks.  So far, so good.  

We knew from things we had heard that we had to order the German Pancake, so we did along with Eggs Benedict, a Strawberry Waffle (which came with choice of egg and meat), and the Valley of the Sun Omelet. And the wait began...

Our server \"C\" was fabulous and I want to give her a loud shout out!  She kept us going with coffee and lots of creamers and lots of fun conversation, but even she admitted several times the wait was crazy.  Seriously, it took almost 40 minutes for our food to finally come to the table.  We watched other tables come and go during this time.  At one point C said they were having an issue with the German Pancake but seriously...then tell the guest and let them order something else.  It was not good.  When the food did come, the waffle was presented minus fruit and no egg and sausage and the same was with the German Pancake, no egg and sausage.  We mentioned it to the woman who delivered the remaining and missing food and that was resolved quickly.  We had to laugh because one of the plates had eggs and burnt sausage and the other plate had eggs and warmed, no color sausage on them.

Ok, the German Pancake is the bomb!  It was great cooked to perfection, with a light dusting of powered sugar and with the additional squeeze of lemon, we all loved it!  The grandson LOVED the omelet, said it was perfect and the best he had had in a long time.  The Benedict was ok...the hollandise lacked serious lemon flavor and just wasn't that great.

What made this adventure better was at the end, the supervisor Sergio, came over and when we told him what had just transpired, he made up for it by providing us with certificates for a free breakfast for two.  We will definitely give them a second try and I'll update the review when we do."}
{"text":"This place happened to catch my eye while looking for a breakfast place this morning and my boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by it! There was about a 5-10 minute wait time as to ensure \"we weren't waiting too long for our waiter\" which I can appreciate. We sat outside which was shaded and they had many water misters as is was already in the 90's so it was fairly pleasant. I ordered the \"Dungeness crab Benedict\" with hash-browns and my boyfriend ordered \"country cousin skillet\" with a biscuit. The food was absolutely amazing. Everything for both of us was perfectly layered and seasoned, and the hash browns were cut much thicker than I've seen before but it was perfect and probably how I'll prefer my hash browns now haha. My only complaint would be the hash browns weren't salted at all but I understand salt isn't everyone's cup of tea. Our waiter was very prompt and friendly. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here after seeing them highlighted on the morning news. It's hard to find places with German pancakes so when I saw they had them I had to try it!!  The Dutch baby was awesome and huge! My mother and I were greeted at the door and immediately sat at a table. We had a stroller and they made sure to seat us at a table where stroller parking was perfect!  Service was great. Can't wait to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time at around 1:00 on a Saturday. There wasn't a crowd so we were seated right away. None of the food was any good. The scrambled eggs were too salty. The hashed browns were too greasy. The biscuits were not fresh.

The service was fine but the food was not. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"The food is standard breakfast fare. Nothing that takes your breath away but not overly disappointing either. They are understaffed so service is really slow.  The coffee was great."}
{"text":"Yummy and big variety in the menu. Nice coffee shop atmosphere. Welcoming staff and great service! 

We are looking forward to dining outside. 

This is a needed addition to the Fulton Ranch neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Ok so they sent me coupon for meal because of my last experience. My fiance, baby and i, went to give it another try. Everything we had was great. Still a nice clean and friendly place to eat. Thanks you guys for making things right."}
{"text":"My husband and I went out to lunch at Egg N' Joe 8-03-17 and I had the hand rolled omelet with crab!!! :)  It was real crab and not the imitation stuff you find all over the valley!!  The omelet had a very delicate texture and you could taste the crab in the omelet.  Oh course we saw on the menu the German pancake which we did not have that day but come back today and had 2!!  One was the lemon and the other was the mixed berries.  All I can say is Yum!!  They have an outside patio with great misters also!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in with the kiddos for breakfast on MLK day. It was busy, but we were seated right away. The server was friendly. My crepe was awesome and the bacon was thick and crispy, just like I like it. My daughter's waffle apparently had to be remade, so they brought out her eggs and sausage and said the waffle would be another 3 minutes. No biggie at all, but the manager came over later and said that they were taking the full cost of her meal off the bill. Nice! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been eagerly anticipating going to Egg 'N Joe for breakfast. As people who don't typically like the long weekend waits we chose a Tuesday morning for our visit. Egg 'N Joe is located at Pinnacle Peak and Scottsdale Road in the new Sprouts shopping center. We're over there all the time because Desert Ridge is so difficult to navigate and such a food wasteland.

Maybe we were hoping for too much. I'd never heard of Egg 'N Joe before and thought it might be locally owned. Unfortunately it's just another franchise place. To me I found the menu to be somewhat limited, especially when it came to  the skillets. When I saw pictures of the food on the menu it was a big letdown. 

Eating here reminded me of going to IHOP or Denny's when I thought we'd get a North Scottsdale experience. the food just isn't that great. In all fairness it's hard to hit the benchmark for me which is Butter's or Butterfield's in Scottsdale. They are the absolute best and you can get just about anything you want. If you're in this neighborhood and want a decent breakfast I would go to JJ's Delicatessen first. 

Egg 'N Joe isn't a place I would seek out or go back to. Pricey, limited menu and there are better options elsewhere for breakfast."}
{"text":"Food is ok much like any chain breakfast restaurant but service was poor.  At first, I thought they were understaffed because our waitress seemed harried, but as time went on, it was clear that our waitress should find a new line of work.  I ordered coffee and my wife ordered a large OJ. The waitress brought two coffees and when my wife said she ordered OJ, she asked what size.  Really? It was only a couple minutes ago.  

When she brought our food, she asked if we needed anything else.  Well, my coffee was empty so I had to ask for more coffee and cream.  It took forever to bring the coffee and she didn't bring cream, so I asked a second time.  When I was done with my food, she finally showed up with coffee and I asked a third time for cream.

Oh, and the silverware which is wrapped up in a napkin only had a knife for my wife.

It doesn't matter how good the food is if the service sucks so we are unlikely to return."}
{"text":"Tara, you rock! Best breakfast I've ever had! Had the avocado benedict, changed my life. I'm no food critic but I've driven cross country and tried different places, including all over Southern Orange County in CA, and this is the best, period. Everything is very fresh, and no expense spared in the food that you order. Can't wait to go back to try something else."}
{"text":"We tried this place on Sunday with about a 15 minute wait. The food and service was great. The wait staff seems to help each other out a lot. Nice to see!  The vegetables in the vegetable omelet were very bright and fresh - not soggy - along with a very yummy biscuit. It seems to be a popular place as there was a line out the door as we were leaving."}
{"text":"Was super happy when Egg N' Joe decided to open up a location closer to where my family lives. The facilities were clean and the employees were really nice/attentive. We ended up ordering the Rancher Breakfast as well as the strawberry german pancake (same menu items we've ordered at the other location we've been to). Sadly the food came out not very good. My wife's eggs were over easy but even the egg white portion wasn't full cooked. The toast that came with my Rancher breakfast was cold, and the hash browns which I requested to be extra crispy were underdone in the middle (pretty much tasted gooey). Lastly, the german pancake we ordered was cold as well and had about a pound of powdered sugar sprinkled on it (literally had to almost flip a portion of the pancake to get rid of the excess powdered sugar).

I did mention this to the staff about the coldness of the food etc., and I got a response of we'll let the kitchen manager know. When we got our bill there was not a single attempt to make it right or even provide a discount. At that point I was very unsatisfied. I may give this location another chance in the future, but will likely take my family to the other location where we've been much happier."}
{"text":"Treated my wife to a Mother's Day meal with the kids here. Ordered their standard biscuit & gravy meal along with their German pancake. The biscuit & gravy meal was hot and deliciously soft/flaky. The hash browns were cooked to perfection as well. The real highlight to the meal was the German pancake (dutch baby essentially). It came out light and flavorful but literally went over the top with the addition of the strawberry sauce.

Customer service was excellent and the entire restaurant was very clean. Overall, a wonderful experience that will definitely have me coming back with my family."}
{"text":"they give you large portions of food but doesn't have barely any flavor I did not enjoy the meal unfortunately!"}
{"text":"My son and I came into this restaurant for the first time last week, awesome food and amazing service. 
Rob made are sure our drinks were full and our food came out quickly. 
Definitely recommend the German Pancakes, yum! 
We will certainly be back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I am giving this new breakfast place 5 stars just on its food! This restaurant has been open only three  days so the service kinks will be worked out over time.
Tried the eggs, buttermilk biscuits, coffee, sausage, Hash browns and of course the German pancake!
All of the items mentioned above were fresh and tasty and the pricing was about average."}
{"text":"Awesome. Food. Had the German pancakes. Brings me back to when I was a child and  my dad would make them. Great food. Great service."}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast. Lots of variety. I had the chicken fried steak and it was great. Super friendly service too. Ask for Brook."}
{"text":"First visit. Wow, what friendly staff! They made me feel very welcome. I had two waiters (one was in-training) which didn't diminish the experience at all. They were both helpful and offered breakfast suggestions. I had to try the German pancake because the last time I had one was when I was a kid...ages ago. I ordered mine with the mixed berries but the waiters were kind enough to bring a sample of the lingonberries too. I also ordered the veggie scramble. Both dishes were yummy. I love the endless coffee! They don't leave an urn on the table but there seems to be a person dedicated to filling coffee cups so it works. Overall A++ experience

Second visit. The waiter I had the first time (during his training) remembered me and said hi. Again the staff was super friendly. Again the food was tasty and I forgot to mention I love how comfy the booths are and everything is super clean. I really enjoy dining at this place. 

Third visit. Brought my husband. He loved it too! This time we ordered a German pancake (so he could try it) and an Avocado Eggs Benedict.  Again the wait staff were happy to bring out samples of the other toppings so Ted got to try the lingonberries as well as the caramel apples. The eggs Benedict was fantastic! Ted commented on how cozy and comfy the space felt. We both had a great experience. 

Fourth visit. Ok so we really love this breakfast joint! This time we tried and split the Valley of the Sun omelet and the Veggie Omelet. Both were yummy but I LOVED the valley of the sun omelet. So delicious. However, the veggie omelet was made better with the chipotle hot sauce on the table. Again service was great and they were all over filling Ted's coffee. I ordered hot tea so I did have to ask for more hot water but I'm sure that's because folks rarely order tea. :) 

Highly recommend this place I've been there during the week and weekends and they are consistently friendly and the food is always good!"}
{"text":"There was a new breakfast joint in town, and my husband and I are always down for a good breakfast place.

The service was really good. They really try to get everything right for you. The atmosphere was like an IHOP in terms of people felt comfortable to meet and talk loudly/converse normally. The decor is clean, modern and minimalistic, but it gives off this village Inn kind of feel with the color palette. 

I had the Dungeness Crab Eggs Benedict with hash browns. The hash browns had peppers, onions and bacon layered in the potatoes, and it was fried in a thin layer upon the plate with a dollop of sour cream. It reminded me of latkes in a way, which made me a bit nostalgic for Midwestern life. The crab was shredded and placed atop a perfectly toasted English muffin, a slice of tomato, a couple pieces of bacon, and an egg smothered with hollandaise. At times, the tomato can overpower the other layers of food, but the combination was very delightful. It was a good amount of food!

My husband had the German pancake for the first time with some strawberries and powdered sugar on top. Let me tell you, that thing was huge! My husband let me have a bite, and it was surprisingly light and airy compared to its look. 

FYI...they have vanilla creamer for coffee! Yay!

Overall, I liked the food, but for some reason it did not knock my socks off as one of the best, go-to places for breakfast like Waffle Love (also in the area), T.C. Eggington (the 60/Alma School) or even Joe's Farmhouse Grill (also down the street).

Honestly, if it's right by you, it doesn't seem you can be disappointed by what they serve; it will satisfy the palate, your appetite and the wallet because it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed.  I ordered the crab omelet with hash browns. The omelet was ok. Nothing to die for, but honest.
When I tried the hashbrown, I immediately regretted.
It was made on rancid fat that left a greasy, expired taste in my mouth.
I am not coming back."}
{"text":"First time here.  Host stated a 15 minute wait; it was 1/2 hour.  We loved sitting on the patio, quiet and away from most of the loud children.  Breakfast skillet with chorizo was divine.  Asked if OJ was fresh squeezed and server said yes.  Later read on the menu \"fresh and natural\". Overall good start.  We will cone back."}
{"text":"Nick was a great server and the German pancake combo with lingonberry buttter was amazing. We sat outside and the broken sunshine on the patio was a nice morning experience. We will plan to be back soon. Loved it and so did everyone at our table."}
{"text":"Almost forgot about my review... I had the crab omelette with egg whites, fresh avocado slices and chunks of crab meat, topped with Hollandaise sauce. It was so delicious. I also wanted to try the German pancakes. Takes about 15min to make it. There were different flavors. Our waiter was nice enough to put 2 different types on the side, so we can compare. The original comes with lemon and butter: you spread the butter around the pancake & squeeze fresh lemon over it. The other was like a berry compote. The texture was somewhat like a thick crepe or blintz. It was flat pancake, like when you forget to add the egg to the mix. Both were yummy but I'll stick to the traditional, thick, fluffy American pancakes. It's a bit pricey. The pancake was $10+ & my crab omelette was $14+. 
Service was good but food came out slow, likely because they make your food fresh & it needs time to cook. Be patient. They get very busy on the weekends. I'd go back again. The menu has other things I'd like to try."}
{"text":"Small place with a big fan base. This means long waits during normal breakfast times. Forget Saturdays and Sundays unless you like hour-long waits to eat. We went late morning on a weekday and had no wait at all. The breakfast was great and the ice tea was fresh brewed. They featured a lot of items from the Pacific Northwest like Snoqualmie Oatmeal and Tillamook dairy. Will go back during non-peak times."}
{"text":"Great food terrific service , would love to come back here on my next visit. Get Kellie as your server."}
{"text":"Stopped to get breakfast to go for my kiddos after I noticed their restaurant as I was passing by.  They do NOT do to go orders!  Huh? Won't waste my time coming back."}
{"text":"Good stuff and happy people. We had the pancakes and the sun devil skillet with rye. We will be back. The skillet was one of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Went to this new breakfast place with a girlfriend this morning.  Food was ok, not fantastic, but not bad.  I have celiac's disease and asked for no bread and they had a hard time with that.  My girlfriend asked for hash browns and got fruit.  All the employees were very nice, just not sure what they are doing.  Kitchen was really slow.   Was really hoping it was be \"allergy friendly\" at least.  It was good, but will not make the effort to go back as there are other really good choices."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a German pancake, did a Yelp search and saw Egg N' Joe got great reviews. Decided to drive the 17 miles to try it even though there's great spots near my house. When we arrived there was no wait, got seated in a comfy booth and ordered quickly. The coffee is great. The strawberry German pancake was amazing! Also got poached eggs, bacon, and hash browns. Couldn't finish all the food, but took the rest home. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here 3 times for breakfast and everything is always fresh,tasty and made from scratch.  Everyone is friendly and accommodating.  The owners also own Elmer's in Palm Springs as well so they have the German Pancakes and they look amazing but I haven't tried one yet, though I have had one at Elmer's.  Recommend eating here if you haven't already, I don't think you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"This was a fantastic breakfast.  I did the traditional eggs Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was divine! Definitely fresh, home made, incredible flavor.  Had to try the German pancake since I've never had it.  This was delicious!  Place is clean, staff is friendly. High quality, fresh food including organic sugar on the tables.  I went 7:30 am on a Saturday and there was a 5 minute wait.  The place was already full,"}
{"text":"Really really good breakfast! Ask to be seated in Alissa's section for great service."}
{"text":"After my 1st review I was contacted by the manager Hope who apologized for our previous experiences and she sent us a coupon good for 2 meals. We went back today and had an excellent experience. The wait wasn't too long and the food and service were great. The crab omelette and crab benedict were very good plus our waitress \"C\" took great care of us."}
{"text":"Excellent choice! The berry crepes are amazing with the chicken sausage! Service five star!!! The wait on a Sunday was 20 minutes and while you wait they offer hot coffee and a great atmosphere!!! Wonder new place in North Scottsdale"}
{"text":"Hosts are impressively neat and personable. Food is excellent!! Environment VERY clean and neat. Highly recommended. Looking forward to my next visit. Thanks Egg N Joe."}
{"text":"Delicious food! I've had both breakfast and lunch and have been impressed every time. The service is great even with how busy they are. The only down side is that there is always a wait and sitting outside to wait is the only option. They have benches to sit but they're not in the shade so it's a little uncomfortable. Other than that, this place is awesome!"}
{"text":"Went for mother's day today and it was extra busy.  The staff were all super friendly and efficient.  This was our first time here, but we met many customers that love this place and eat here often.  My mom had strawberry crepes which she absolutely loved.  I had an omelette (trying to stay low carb is hard in this place!!!)  Mine was good, I have no complaints, but the german pancake was quite popular and looked very yummy.  I will definitely be back here.  (Giving it a 4 out 5 stars because my omelette wasn't to die for, but everything else was excellent )"}
{"text":"Cute brunch place. The German pancake is so huge! Maybe if it was a tad bit thinner it would have had some crispy sides. Service was friendly. Our server even gave me a free German pancake voucher for my birthday! Hash browns were good. A Little oily, but tasty."}
{"text":"This was absolutely amazing the fries were crispy and delicious. The burger was juicy l, it was just all so good"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  I had the German crepe and it brought me right back to my childhood.  It was delicious.  My husband had the valley of the sun omelet and he loved it.  The service was great too.  We will definitely make this a regular place to visit."}
{"text":"Actually the food is good not to tasty aaammm but the service and servers were very nice"}
{"text":"Good and friendly service, delicious food!  A great way to start the day with the right food ;)
Depending on when you get there on a Sunday, you might or might not be able to be seated right away.  Don't fret if you're not seated fast.  There is plenty of room to wait.  Outside they usually set up water and coffee, and there's umbrellas to avert the sun.  If you have to wait, even though the place is not too big, the wait is usually no more than 30 minutes.  The thing to get at Egg N' Joe is the German pancake.  It is good any way you order it.  I also had an omelette and regular pancakes in the past, and they were also perfect.  I have food sensitivities and when I ordered the omelette, egg whites only, no lactose products, they brought exactly what I ordered and it was delicious . (I had ordered the Valley of the Sun omelette).  If I could, I would go there everyday for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Egg n Noe is your average breakfast and lunch place. We stopped in on a Sunday morning. The place was moderately busy. We were greeted right away, and our server was by and took our drink orders. Upon reviewing the menu I decided on 2 eggs, bacon, and toast. I askes for my eggs cooked overhard and the bacon crispy. After placing our order, it wasn't long and our food was out. I was suprised given how busy it was. Anyways, my eggs were cooked perfectly and the bacon was good. I felt the prices are a little high for what the menu offers."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot in Gilbert. My server, Angela, was incredibly friendly, and attentive. For a moderately busy Tuesday my food came out hot and fast and Angela kept my coffee mug full for the duration of my visit. I went with the standard bacon and eggs over easy. Everything was perfectly cooked. The German pancakes look amazing! I'll be getting those next trip for sure. This is a great spot of you are tired of the whole Dennys/Village Inn type of fare. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I sit in this nicely designed new breakfast restaurant. As one of the other reviewers stated it's a Denny/IHOP/Village Inn/ mix. The ambiance is bright and fresh. The food was ok, not bad just not exceptional. I had scrambled eggs and bacon. The eggs were prepared by folding and had a rubbery texture, not bad, just a style. The bacon was thick and tasty. (premium cut) The German pancakes seem to be the speciality. I guess I'm just too YELPy this morning. The pricing was as expected. I don't know. This place is on my way to work, I want WOW and I didn't find it."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service and food! Michelle was so sweet and attentive, even being super busy!"}
{"text":"I read through other reviews before we decided to go to Egg N' Joe and I'm glad I did! We called ahead and got a time to be there for our table. The waiting area is kind of crowded like others have said but we got there just a few minutes before our table was ready and stayed in the car so our kids didn't go stir crazy. Our waitress was very attentive and timely. The food was fantastic and every person in our party said they wanted to come here again next time for breakfast!"}
{"text":"The German pancake!! That is what drew me into this new breakfast place , and that is what you need to try ASAP!! Our waitress said you could order the German pancake any way you want it. I went with the traditional style , which means your pancake comes topped with powdered sugar and lemon wedges. It tasted just like a lemon bar , it was so good! The batter was light and crispy, and pancake itself had to be The size of a hubcap. I ordered my German pancake with two eggs and bacon. The bacon was thick cut and perfectly cooked as were the over easy eggs. My husband ordered a plate that included eggs ,bacon, hash browns, and a biscuit. The biscuit was fantastic. It tasted like something out of your grandmothers kitchen. Overall I give this place a five out of five . Because this place is new , make sure you arrive early this place gets crowded quick"}
{"text":"Any restaurant that does not show prices on its website is extremely suspect. I'll take Denny's!"}
{"text":"The food is awesome and reasonably priced. The loaded hash browns are to die for. Our server, Stephanie, was very attentive and a lot of fun. This will be a new regular for us!"}
{"text":"1st visit

Nice traditional menu

I had the:

Farmers omelet, hold the bell peppers and potatoes on the side w/fruit. Omelet was very good added a little cholula and pepper and it was on point. Fruit bowl included freshly sliced  pineapple, banana, and grapes 

Daily smokehouse bacon and eggs. Bacon is a nice thick cut, tasted great and not greasy. Eggs were cooked over medium and tasted good. Buttermilk biscuits are made from scratch and tasted good. 

Restaurant is clean and the staff was very friendly. There is also outside seating. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is my second visit to this place. First visit was top notch. Wait staff was friendly and attentive and food was delicious.  Second visit was just okay. Waiter took forever to get us water and we were sitting outside in August. My friend finally got up and got her own after waiting for 15 min for someone to come around. Ordered our food and that was fast, but the food was just okay.  I ordered the crab eggs Benedict and asked for the lighter edition of that.  It was half of the order it normally is, but I was still charged full price. I was too busy chatting with my friend and didn't even notice the overcharge until I was on my way home and thought about how much I was charged. Maybe they do charge full price on a half order, idk, but if the waiter had mentioned the charge would still be the same, I would have gotten the full order and taken half home. Also there was barely any crab on the food, so not worth the price. Haven't decided if I will go again."}
{"text":"The German pancake is amazing!! 2 people can totally share it. This is our new spot. It's super soft. We got the caramel apple topping. Best breakfast around."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place before, but gave it a try on Yelp's recommendation.
The food was great, coffee exceptional. I would highly recommend them for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Several good items on menu along with a couple of unique offerings. Can get very busy on Sat/Sun mornings. Best to come before 8am or prepare to wait for a bit."}
{"text":"So good! So much so that I was actually shocked how low the bill was when it came. This is my new favorite breakfast place for sure."}
{"text":"Come here every weekend for eggs benedict!! Outstanding. Service (Janet M) is friendly and service is quick. Great atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"Decent place for breakfast. I really enjoyed the coffee from Portland Oregon and appreciated they got me in fast. However the loud atmosphere high prices and so-so food made the experience just ok. The eggs and pancakes were fine but nothing exceptional. Not sure I would go back. For the price of the food I would have expected higher quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Luckily my friend was early last Sunday morning and I was a little late (iMaps took me to the WinCo just south of ENJ for some reason) so the wait was short as we were seated only a few minutes after I arrived. The patio was pleasant especially this time of year. 

I do not usually like omelettes but the Crabacodo was too intriguing to pass, and it turned out to be more like a breakfast burrito with an egg wrapping in the place of a tortilla. This was by far the best omelette I ever had, and they are not lying about it having real crab (the little bit of shell I found was definitive proof)!  We shared a German pancake which was a truly unique experience (eating part of the middle where the melted butter and powder sugar pools is as close as I ever hope to get to mainlining heroin).  

My only complaint is that the outside servers seemed to spend a disproportionate amount of their time chatting with the people sitting at one table as opposed to checking on our drink refills etc. 

My overall experience was very positive though, and the Egg N' Joe will definitely be a regular part of my breakfast restaurant rotation!"}
{"text":"This spot was fantastic. Our party of three arrived around 930am in a Saturday. We sat outside. The host was nice upon arrival. I thought the service was overall fantastic. We received a complimentary German pancake and the restaurant manager came around during the meal asking how things tasted. She also gave us a $10 coupon for next visit. I'd never been here before, but this will be a regular stop for me. Good food, good service, good prices. Thanks for a nice breakfast!"}
{"text":"Started the New Year off right by having a late breakfast at Eggs N Joe. Great coffee, fresh food, and first class service. Our waitress Angela took great care of us. She is right you gotta have the bacon. She even gave us a VIP packet because she asked if we had visited before. We will be coming back again and asking for Angela. If 2017 is anything like our breakfast at Egg N Joe, 2017 is going to be a great year."}
{"text":"Had the eggs Benedict, was just okay. Other than that the service was good, 30 min wait as expected on the weekend!"}
{"text":"First time here, place seemed fine.  Was very busy, we were greeted and seated promptly.  The place just wasn't clean and our number one measurement is the bathrooms.  If the bathrooms aren't clean chances are the kitchen isn't either. But back to the restrooms, very smelly and dirty."}
{"text":"All good here with excellent orange juice now. Have asked for plain waffle, eggs medium and bacon. Adjoining tables' food looks real good. Bacon was excellent. Eggs ok but barely medium cooked. Waffle was...kinda yuk. I couldn't eat that, even with lots of pretty good syrup. Standard cake mix waffle."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have come here twice. The first time, I didn't feel like we were anything spectacular. We ordered a couple normal things and appreciated our waitress a lot. She was great and very pleasant.

The second time, we had the same waitress and decided to bring our 2.5 year old. She was wonderful with him! She has kids of her own and was very understanding and accommodating. She told him to take \"dinosaur bites\" and he loved her! That's a lot to say for a two year old.

Not only was she wonderful the second time around... but on a busy breakfast shift, she remembered us from last time. She remembered my boyfriend's side order of biscuits and gravy. He had ordered only water for breakfast... but as we were leaving, she asked, \"would you like a Mountain Dew to go?\" because that's what he had ordered the very first time we were there. We were both in awe, and so thankful for her kind words and her amazing memory. She is fantastic! I want to say her name was Kellie. I hope I'm right.

Besides the service.... the food is AMAZING! We love it there. Two times in, and I know we will become regulars. Thank you so much for two great experiences! I'm sure there is many more to come."}
{"text":"We've been here 3 times now and the lack of attentive service is the same:( The food was excellent , salad and 3 breakfast plates.  They forgot avacado on a breakfast it's suppose to have. Coffee cup was dirty with food particles floating inside coffee :/We sat outside and got a little forgotten. The manager was very helpful and attentive though at times ."}
{"text":"Awesome! I took my son there for his birthday and they made him feel so special. They make him a special birthday pancake and also had everyone sign a card for him. How awesome is that. He felt great. The food is fresh and yummy. The potatoes cakes are a must have!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot. Food was great and the service was the best Ive ever had! TJ was my server and if he isn't on track for a management opportunity, he should be. Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"OK - so my re-review has been a little over do. I was reached out by management immediately after I posted my review and was provided with a voucher for two free meals. I totally appreciate their urgency to want to rectify the horrible experience I had my first visit. So kudos for that.

When I finally got around to getting back to Egg N' Joe, there were some positive improvements! On weekends they started to provide fresh coffee to patrons waiting, there was better more effective communication between the hosts and their guests. Thankfully we went on a Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy so we waited maybe 10 minutes tops!

This time around I went for a more \"basic\" breakfast - which I am glad I did! Simple is better sometimes! I will admit though I did LOVE their biscuit and gravy. Their biscuit reminded me of something that I would get at a cafe in the Midwest.
 
Service can still use a bit of work, out waitress while friendly seemed overwhelmed. We saw her 3 times during our visit.. When we sat, when we got our food and when she dropped our check. 

Food isn't knock your socks off good - but it's adequate! If your in the area it's worth a shot!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but not so good that I want to go back. They're very skimpy on the hollandaise and gravy, which seems to be the norm given the other review pictures I see. I asked for scrambled eggs and got fried (gross). The server never came back to check on us and then mixed up our check with the couple next to us, who unfortunately didn't notice and left having paid our (allegedly) slightly more expensive bill. I can forgive the mix ups, but I can't forgive the skimping on hollandaise and gravy!"}
{"text":"Best. Breakfast. Ever!!!  I cook a better breakfast than ANYONE! Until NOW! The Cinnamon Roll pancake... WOW! I actually had Battered Fish and Clam Chowder, because let's be honest... I was afraid! I shared with my hubby, and he shared his pancakes with me. We will be back to have that German Pancake!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Food was ok. Basic breakfast without any originality. I had biscuits and gravy and gravy had very little sausage in it and had a bit too much of a flour taste. Eggs were undercooked for my over medium liking. Walking away full but not needing another trip here as there are too many far better breakfast joints to go to instead."}
{"text":"Honestly the worst and most bland breakfast food I gave ever had. Cool atmosphere though."}
{"text":"Plenty of delicious breakfast food! Teresa had the potato package and I had the regular pancakes. Both great."}
{"text":"I liked this place. Good prices, friendly staff, great food and large portions. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my  breakfast here, had the german pancake, triple berry  combo came with eggs and ham. All very good. Large portions of food.  The service was excellent.  My coffee  cup was never empty.  Cant wait to go back ."}
{"text":"I got the eggs Benedict and the poached egg was well cooked and didn't make for a good runny egg like you would expect. Was pretty disappointed and didn't even care to finish it. Below average food at best. Ihop is better."}
{"text":"The green juice is AMAZINGLY good. You have to get there early because they often run out since they make it fresh daily. 
Also their oatmeal and apple whole wheat pancakes are heaven. 
Everything I have had here is always SUPER fresh. They have some really great people on staff there as well. Friendly, and quick service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"We went here the first time today and after just a 20 minute wait- we were seated and the waiter was very pleasant and took our drink order. I got iced tea (tasted fresh brewed) and my husband got the O.J. We decided on the Denver Omelette and the Deluxe Rancher. Both were very good!!  The hashbrowns were crispy and the biscuits were wonderful! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Thanks to waitress Tara we had a fun and pleasant dining experience!!! She knew the menu and was on top of her game! Great service with a smile! Didn't rush off, and took her time!!! Which was noticed and appreciated!!
Love the fresh food with big portions! Strong awesome coffee!!!The restaurant is big, bright and modern!!! Love everything about the place!!! Thank you Joe!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered the honey cured ham & eggs with hash browns and a coffee. The coffee was your typical cafe drip coffee. The meal was delicious my only complaint was the ham could have been more tender, and the over easy eggs were bland. I love the atmosphere here. It felt like I was a eating a huge balanced breakfast at home."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the whelm visiting from CA and noticed menu was similar to Elmers in Palm Springs.  Learned Elmers is the mother company and they are off shoots and are opened til 230.  Great food and they have the German pancakes  Need a few of these in the Inland Empire."}

Come for the German Pancake and Avocado Benedict!

I was invited to this morning's private training event by Elmer's Restaurants Online Media Director Kolten Lindsey via email a few weeks ago.  I was allowed to take up to three guests with me, but due to schedule constraints (and a mistake in actual date given and confusion that ensued), I was only able to sync with a cousin, who very much enjoyed today's breakfast jaunt, as did I!  It was very nice to be personally greeted by Kolten and the president of Elmer's Restaurants, Inc., Jerry Scott, who both spoke of the history of the business (25 stand-alone locations, most in the Northwest), as well as to the reasons behind their newest concept, Egg 'N Joe.  This Scottsdale location is the first to open in the U.S., and two more are set to open in Gilbert and Chandler later this year, according to Jerry.  Elmer's private shareholders wanted to be able to offer their company's breakfast and lunch offerings in smaller, intimate spaces that would lend themselves to find homes in shopping centers, rather than launch 7000, or larger, square-foot stand-alones.  My 20-something cousin and I found the cozy space decorated nicely with lovely red plates and mustard-yellow mugs on one wall, and we enjoyed the complimentary meals and non-alcoholic beverages.  I tipped our server \"S.\" 20% of the original ticket price (pre-tax), plus a little extra [1], while I dropped $15 in the donation cashbox to help fund Banner Children's Cardon Children's Medical Center's Music Therapy program, which Egg 'N Joe pledged to match dollar for dollar!

There were ten entrees and a handful of beverages to choose from-- not the actual menu, but a condensed one for today's private event. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=FwSyyReH3TNgpc1xQPylqw  My cousin ordered a cup of hot chocolate and the Avocado Benedict, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=IA_EBlGJplpvzq6ZDrUsmA and I ordered a cup of black coffee and the German Pancake Combo, with lemon wedges and minus the powdered sugar. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=FyPlrotrKvGZri1QDRun9A  This dish also came with choice of two eggs (over-medium) and choice of meat (\"S.\" recommended Daily's smokehouse bacon). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=wN0QHq96fmWfReH4AxxoCA  After \"S.\" placed our orders, I decided to put in an order of Lingonberry crepes after a discussion I had with Kolten after I had asked him, \"Fruit Festival Crepes Combo, or Lingonberry Crepes Combo?\"  He immediately suggested the Lingonberry, as he had just had it earlier, and after a few questions with the kitchen manager, we found out that out of all the fruit toppings, the lingonberry sauce, which came with whipped butter mixed in, is the only one that didn't have cornstarch in it (unlike the triple berry, strawberry, and maple-caramel apple). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=fhwgnbs3A5evBJZBe0Hg6w  So, I asked him if it would be too much to order another entree, and he said no.  :)  I asked him which choice of meat did he recommend, keeping in mind that I already have bacon coming, and he said for me to try one of each link, although his first suggestion was to get the bacon.  In retrospect, I should've stuck with bacon, because the three strips were PERFECTION. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/egg-n-joe-scottsdale?select=ZNpie7Y6gzq6iuZuGCgbkQ

Cousin enjoyed her hot chocolate, as well as the Avocado benedict, which came sans avocado, because \"S.\" had not heard her say it.  We wondered why, since it was the only benedict selection offered on the condensed menu. This was quickly remedied when \"S.\" delivered a saucer with avocado on it.  I enjoyed the German pancake's texture and lemony flavor from the wedges.  Thank goodness Sprout's is next door, because I forgot my personal bottle of maple syrup... [2]  Kolten offered to bring a saucer of extra lingonberry butter for me to use on the pancake-- AWESOME suggestion, Kolten!  Thank you!  The bacon strips, as I already mentioned, were perfect, and while the eggs came over-easy, I still liked them very much, especially compared to the \"soft\" scrambled eggs which arrived pretty hard.  Ugh.  Cousin thought they were good, though, but I'm picky about scrambled eggs-- Mom prepares the BEST!  I also liked the texture of the crepes, but found them to be too greasy!  I'd soon order the German pancake again and ask for the lingonberry sauce, minus the butter, on the side!  FYI, both links were awful!  Were they rancid?  I wouldn't order them again. 

Thank you to Kolten Lindsey for reaching out with the invitation, and to Jerry Scott and Egg 'N Joe staff for having us over.  We will return!

[1] Would've tipped more, but cuz & I noticed \"S.\" started looking very annoyed with us towards the end.  Major turn off!

[2] ENJ offers two syrup options: a corn syrup blend and sugar-free."}
{"text":"I had eggs benedict. It was one of the best I'd ever had. My son had buttermilk pancakes and loved those too. The service was great and the food exceptional. I don't know why anyone would give less than a 5 star."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were SO excited to see Egg N Joe coming in near our house! We lived in Scottsdale near the other EggNJoe but never had the chance to try it out before we moved. 

We were seated in a booth and greeted by a young man named Gus. He recommended the crabacado omelette which is made of fresh Dungeness crab, bacon, avocados, and cheese, topped with hollandaise sauces. Gus was so great and we loved his bright personality. 

When our food came out (Jimmy ordered the country fried steak), plating with was perfect. And Gus was right, the crabacado omelette was DELICIOUS! 
Thank you for the awesome service today!"}
{"text":"Had to wait a while even though they weren't busy. Server was a bit rude. Food was okay but flavors did not stand out. Price was a little higher than other places."}
{"text":"Positives: Eggs and bacon were delicious. Warrants the 2 stars given.

Negatives: 
* Service was next to none in regards to waitstaff. Hostess was very friendly. 
* Fruit was slimey.
* Hash browns tasted like they were cooked with either old oil or of very low quality ingredients. Drowned them in hot sauce, salt, and pepper to make them edible.
* Coffee tasted burnt.
* No toilet paper in the bathroom stall.
* Atmosphere was very old diner, complete with flies and dirty floors.  

Will not be back."}
{"text":"They advertise a northwest theme. The Dungeness eggs Benedict was tasty. Portion sizes are above average. They say the hashbrowns are from the Northwest.... Not sure what the difference is. 
The only major disappointment we had was that the Ivers clam chowder was extremely bland. If you gonna call yourself an ivars  clam chowder you need to live up to it...."}
{"text":"Food seems to be made from scratch. Clean with an open atmosphere with good service. I will definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Very average breakfast at prices higher than the food is worth. We were seated immediately and the service and food were quick."}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  We took my wife here for her Bday.  We called ahead and found it was an hour wait.  They gave us an estimated time to arrive so we didn't have to wait there.  

We get there and get seated right away.  We had a party of 13 and they tried to fit us in a booth.  That didn't work but they were fine with us grabbing the nearest table to us.  It was close to lunch time and the breakfast rush was done.

So much scrumptious items to choose from.  I go with the Bacon, Tillamook Potato Cakes, and Eggs.  I also order a Classic German pancake for the table.  Never had one and I seen a bunch of pics so why not?  My wife decides to get the Country Fried Steak and Eggs.

The food doesn't take long to arrive.  I get my plate and I have 2 crispy potato cakes, several slices of bacon and my over easy eggs.  I am not impressed by the portion size but the taste totally makes up for it.  The crunchy outside gives way to a very well seasoned potato cake with cheese.  The bacon as good as it gets and my egg was cooked perfectly.  Runny.  I mopped that plate up.  My wife said that her meal was good too.  Her meal came with a biscuit which I happily finished for her.  Don't know if it was made fresh but it looked and taste like it.  I would order a half a dozen to go if I could.

Now to the German Pancake.  When it gets delivered, the waitress gives us the direction to spread the butter across the pancake, then squeeze the lemon slices to get the lemon juice.  Mix both over the pancake to glaze.  Lemon juice and butter?  Maybe on a crab.  But for some reason it worked.  It tasted like a lemon tart.  It gets soggy if it sits but I was able to cut into pie pieces and roll it up into a croissant type shape.  We decided we have to try the German Pancake with the fruit fillings.

All in all, everyone was satisfied with their meal and the prices were not outrages.  The servings for the kids plates were large but like I said, I could have gone with another Potato Cake on my plate.  Oh well, we are still going back."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place!!!! I'm from California and came to Arizona to visited some family for Thanksgiving. I was staying at the Double Tree hotel literally right down the street from the restaurant and yelp brunch/mimosas. Egg n Joe came up with good reviews and the food looked good so my family and I went. We were seated right away (and mind you this was on Thanksgiving Day). The food was AMAZING! The bacon and biscuits are to DIE FOR! I totally forgot to take pictures but I was so hungry and the food smelled/looked good. And don't forget to order your mimosa pitcher 

Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Tried again, but the wait for a table continues to be ridiculous. (35 minutes this time)  Waiter was great...helpful and on top of things. Still....a long wait for the food to arrive at table and it was mediocre in quality. Place is clean & cheerful, albeit with a generic, IHOP look & feel. 
Nothing to see here folks....move on."}
{"text":"We come here about once per month. Dilynn is almost always our waitress and she is awesome. The food is consistently great and well made as well as delivered quickly. If you get here at or before 8am there is no wait to be seated. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Our server, Cory did an excellent job making sure we were satisfied with our meal! Would return just for his great customer service!"}
{"text":"Very different place for breakfast and I loved the food. This is a place you can go back to many times and get something different each time and love it."}
{"text":"We went here three days in a row everything was very good. Had the  avocado eggs Benedict, Belgium waffle, and fish and chips and all were above average.
It is crowded on weekends but better during the week.
Best place for breakfast and lunch in Southern Chandler."}
{"text":"The food is really good here but boy, is it expensive. 35.00 for two for breakfast."}
{"text":"On a recent busy Sunday at 11 am we had another great experience at Egg N Joe.  The folks we checked in with up front were friendly and we were seated sooner than their estimate. 
For 3 adults and a 2 year old - Cheryl B took care of us with a smile on her face and would always check back with us despite how busy she was. 
Great employees, food and service, our kind of restaurant."}
{"text":"A great spot if you're in a hurry and want a hearty breakfast. We had great service and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"Just came here for breakfast this past Sunday! My dad came first to reserve a table but he was immediately seated lol. That was at 8am- and when the rest of us came there around 8:20, it was pretty full. When we left at 9:20, there was a line of people waiting! But duh. Anyway, they have a table outside with coffee and creamer on it for people to drink while waiting!! 

I ordered a skillet. The Sundevil one of course #forksupppp!! I got it without chorizo because I don't eat meat. It was very good. Full of fresh veggies, like red & green peppers. Didn't even need the meat! My son got chocolate chip pancakes and he loved them and the kids portion was actually a lot of food! 

My dad and brother both got some type of \"Special\" off the menu and they loved it all! My brother's did look really good. It was some biscuit/gravy meal.

Service wasn't awesome. They didn't check on us much and we had to seek out our own silverware. The cost is average for a breakfast place. 

I wouldn't say I was blown away by this place- because to me it compared to an IHOP rather than like a local diner (moreso what I was expecting and hoping for).. NEXT TIME I VOW TO GET THE GERMAN PANCAKE!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Especially the service! HUGE SHOUT OUT to Janet! My family and I come in a lot and we've recently asked for Janet to be our server for every time we come in. She's very knowledgeable of the menu, very attentive, and always has a smile on her face. She is a SWEET HEART! I'm a server myself and she's the best server I've ever encountered! Thank you for being you, Janet!"}
{"text":"Had chicken fried burger, it was nasty, fries were skimpy, and ended up feeling nauseous the rest of the night. Couldn't even think about making dinner. Our first time there. Will not go back. Sad less than a mile away. We do breakfast on Sunday mornings and we have a 100.00 dollar bill with us. Usually it cost less than 30.00 and we leave the rest for a tip. Our waitress at egg and Joe didn't bring the extra sauce asked for and was too busy taking to a woman sitting by the door, and the poor guy behind us ordered 4 eggs and toast and to ask another person how long that takes to get that, our waitress sucked Stephanie, and could overheard her talking about training another person. I hope not. I was a waitress for 14 yrs and customers come first not your social time. It just sucked."}
{"text":"Stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning. It was very busy but we got seated in approximately 10 minutes. 4 people in our group. 4 breakfasts with 4 coffees. Total bill was $56 plus tip. The food came out quickly and was delicious. Good portion sizes too. Just a bit on the loud side in the restaurant. The staff was very friendly, and our waitress Hannah was great!"}
{"text":"Egg N' Joe has been on my mind since they opened, I am not familiar with the area of Ocotillo nor do I ever venture out that way. 
However, I was absolutely going to try this place when the timing was right. The timing was today.
I ordered the Crabacado omelette because the Dungeness crab and hollandaise sounded the a match made in breakfast heaven! 
Of course we had to order the strawberry German pancake. Which is similar to a giant, delicious crepe! 
Nothing underwhelmed us and nothing disappointed! 
My only complaint on the entire dining experience is that my omelette was cold. It didn't stop me from devouring it but would be something I paid attention to next time. 
Soon they will have a liquor license and I'm really intrigued on what breakfast cocktails they'll serve!!"}
{"text":"Terrific from top to bottom. It was busy (Sat AM) but we were greeted and sat quickly. Food came out fresh and flavorful (cinnamon roll pancakes!) and was a generous size. For our first time, they even gave us a thank you letter and coupon for next time. A+!"}
{"text":"Great Food and Great customer service. Love the German pancake, it's huge and comes with eggs and meat too! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We are very tough food critics. We dine out often. When we like a place, it's food and most importantly the price, we usually return and frequent it often. Egg N Joe is one of those places now on our short list. I couldn't come up with one complaint, and the wife and I are usually very good at it.  Even the server Tara was perfect, and she was covering the entire patio by herself. Please Egg N Joe, just don't do what many other places have done when they start getting too popular and start raising prices, adjusting the menu and shrinking food portions, or else I won't return. You have a winning recipe here, don't touch it.  As I'm writing this I've had the Supervisor, and the kitchen Manager, Valerie, come out to check on us and ask for feedback. Another woman came out to check on us and I don't even know who she was, LOL. You'd think they knew I was writing this Yelp review or maybe thought we were celebrities or something, which we are not!  Highly recommend it here 4 sure."}
{"text":"THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A BREAKFAST WITH CRAB IN IT!

Ordered a crab eggs benedict, and it had big ol' honkin' chunks of tasty crab on it. *REAL* crab, not \"krab\". The kind that used to swim and feed on rotting ocean goop. The kind that you have to coax out of a shell. Seems like every place which has crab on their menu uses that fake-ass bullshit and calls it \"crab\", which is a *HUGE* pet peeve of mine. Not Egg N'Joe! Also their German pancake is made from the stuff of children's dreams.

Service was great, prices were reasonable, and all in all I was thoroughly impressed."}
{"text":"The only thing bad is it's always busy, except to wait.  Went on a Friday at 9:30 am and still was crowded. Was excited to try the food based off their website photos, and have to say the food looked the same in person. I had the Springtime Eggs Benedict and it was delicious! The bacon on it was to die for and paired it with fruit to have a little healthier option on the side. Should have took a picture of it, but didn't think about until half way through the meal because it was so good. The menu also looked like it had a lot of other choices I would like to try."}
{"text":"Omg!! Had the German pancake with strawberries.. and hubby had crap Benedict.. was amazing!! Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Just had my first breakfast (Farmer's Omelet) at the North Scottsdale location and had outdoor seating with misting system on that made it perfect. In addition to the fabulous omelet, the only thing that could make my experience the best was the great service by Tara, our server. What more can you say about someone that goes out of her way to know our four names, obviously has fun and loves her job and people, and value-adds to our experience? Thanks, Tara! We will be back and will be recommending the restaurant and you, too of course  :)"}

{"text":"We had a very good experience with our first visit to the new Egg N' Joe here in Chandler, which made us happy as this area really needs a great breakfast option! We arrived pretty late in their day (around 1:00pm) so there wasn't a wait but the service was still friendly and welcoming. The restaurant itself is comfortable and inviting. Our server was attentive and all smiles. She kept the drink refills coming and our food came out just as ordered and was quite tasty. We are always a bit reserved when visiting a restaurant that hasn't been open for very long because they often need time to get all of their operational ducks in a row before making a positive impression. But that wasn't the case here. We will be back and hopefully the experience will be just as positive in the midst of a customer rush as it was on this slow afternoon."}
{"text":"This appears to be the new and must visit restaurant this part of Chandler. We stopped on by on a quiet Saturday, well after all the snowbirds have left town, and the wait was 30 minutes inside or brave the heat and lack of shade on the patio for immediate seating. Although it was warm out, the May days haven't hit way over 100 yet, so we elected for the patio.  Three of the coveted tables were in the shade of the building, while the other six or so other tables were directly in the sun.  Why they don't have umbrellas for shade, no idea!

The server was very nice, but she seemed a little overwhelmed.  She was either Johnny on the Spot or would disappear for awhile. 

The food was decent to good.  I went withthe traditional breakfast plate. I know it was lunch, but most of their menu was breakfast and the name is Egg & Joe. It is in the picture below. My dad went with the German pancake, it was really good, but defintely add the eggs and breakfast meat to make it something substantial.  My mom went with the Southwest Chicken, the lighter portion. It was a good size and looked pretty good. She liked it. For being in the burbs the prices were a little higher than most places nearby.

The aesthetics of this place are a little lacking, it is somewhere between Village Inn and Snooze.

Would I go back? In the words of my mom, I wouldn't race back. It would be good in a pinch, but I think I would rather go down the street to Village Inn or The Black Bear for something similar."}
{"text":"Tara is the best server, always so friendly and takes great care of us.  Oh, and the food is good too, especially the Cinnamon Roll Pancakes!"}
{"text":"Great place on a weekday, I have to say that because I don't know how well/crowded it would be on a weekend. I took my friend here for a late breakfast, the staff was great, we were greeted and sat quickly and they could tell my friend was having a bad day and made our visit even better. We had the German pancake, which was amazing! And we also split a potato pancake plate. The potato cakes were crisp and had great flavor I would order both these items again. Julie was the name of our waitress who was cheerful and kept our glasses full. I am going back for sure."}
{"text":"I visited 2 weeks after they opened. I got here around 9:30 and it was slammed. I was impressed that they were on top of everything and the service was great. I had the crepes, biscuit, hash browns. Food was good but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"Delicious!!!!

I have never heard of a German pancake, until I ate here. Absolutely amazing!!

The staff is super friendly, and the prices are perfect for the super quality food.

I got the German Pancake meal which includes two eggs and a meat.  I love their bacon!!!

I got the triple fruit topping on the pancake and eggs scrambled. 

So imagine my dismay when my order showed up, and I had 2 eggs over easy with the lemon butter topping on the pancake. 

The staff was very apologetic when I mentioned the mistake, and within a minute I had the proper food in front of me.

Of course it was amazing.  A German Pancake is like nothing you have ever tried.  The closest I can come to describing it is  it's like a giant, more firm, crepe.  Delish. When it was time to go, my server, Andrew, apologized again for the mix up, and even gave me a VIP envelope, which contained a discount for my next visit.  

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, enjoyed the food and excellent service. First time I have had German pancakes. Great value, bacon, ham and eggs were excellent as well. We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Service was fast & awesome.  Nikki was very fast.  great foooooddd.  loved the German pancakes. yum yum"}
{"text":"Definitely, a restaurant you don't want to miss out on! There will be a line, but they accommodate you with coffee and a welcoming smile. The Food, the staff and the atmosphere is worth waiting for.
Definitely coming back, totally love it!!"}
{"text":"Good food, now open about 2 weeks, will be a long run for this place! I had the Crabacado omelet , she had berry crepes with lingonberry butter.  Good eats!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast on weekday, long lines, waited about 10 minutes, not too bad. I'm sure it'll be worse during weekends. 

Ordered crab benedict, chicken fried steak and german pancake. We all enjoyed our food very much. My husband especially enjoyed his chicken fried steak. Have eaten german pancake in a CA restaurant before that was much thicker and chewier than the one here. But all's good. 

Service was excellent. Our server constantly check up on us to make sure we have everything. 

The only thing is the price, that I think is a little higher than I'd like. 

Will definitely go back again. It's the only breakfast place I know in Chandler that serves crab omelet, crab benedict, and german pancake, love it!"}
{"text":"The place is always busy and had to try.  What a great place!  The food & coffee were so good. Tried an omelet and switched to a pancake instead of biscuit.  Everything we saw coming out looked so good and very beautiful presentation.  It reminded us of our favorite place in Scottsdale called \"Butters.\"   Awesome local place!"}
{"text":"Awesome place and food! Was able to get a booth seat without an issue. Service was good. Prices were reasonable. A++"}
{"text":"I've never met a chicken fried steak I didn't like...until this morning. I ordered the \"lite\" chicken fried steak, eggs, biscuit and hash browns. (Shouldn't \"lite\" be an oxymoron, in this case?) The steak was pasty, gravy was tasteless. The biscuit was huge! It was doughy and under baked. Hash browns weren't browned. The scrambled eggs were the best thing on the plate and they were average, scrambled eggs. I left most of my breakfast on the plate.

Service was good and the staff was friendly -- just couldn't make up for a poorly cooked breakfast that likely came from the freezer."}
{"text":"Don't let the generic coffee shop look fool you, this place offers great breakfasts, good coffee, and friendly service. I really enjoyed my German pancake, my wife loved her fruit topped waffle, and we both thought the coffee was great. I understand \"Egg N' Joe\" is owned by \"Elmer's\" which is famous in the Pacific Northwest and explains why their waffle and pancake was so good. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Food was ok, I had the bacon & avacado omelet and it had a lot of onion in it. I wouldn't order it again or at least ask for no onions. We did like their potatoes."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice now and both times the food and service was good, our new go to place for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal, but the food was VERY sub par. My child had a grilled cheese that was not only very greasy, but two pieces were only bread, no cheese. I had the farmers omelette with hash browns and a biscuit, the best part was the biscuit. My hash browns were only fully cooked on the top and all I could taste was grease. My omelette was not that good. Other than the friendly staff, I will not go back unless they get a new cook."}
{"text":"Hade a great breakfast this morning at Egg and Joe. It was our first visit and Nikki took very good care of us. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Looking for a new breakfast place and this showed up on Yelp. It's a very clean open space that reminds me of The Original Pancake House chain. The menu is great and I had a hard time ordering because everything look so good. I decided on the German pancake platter. It's a very large crepe like pancake with lemon wedges and powdered sugar. It was fantastic.  Could have had another. Coffee was hot and really good too. Waitress was right there with refills and a check. Very well done."}
{"text":"I have been here 4 times now and tried 4 different breakfast meals.  All 4 were excellent.  My favorite was the crab eggs Benedict.  Yummmm!  Very friendly and prompt service as well.  This is becoming my go to place for breakfast."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try new breakfast spots. I saw this one when I was at Costco a few weeks ago. Finally able to try it today. All I have to say is yum. I can't wait to go back and try different items on the menu. This morning I had the triple berry French Toast. Killed it. Next time I want to try the German pancake it looked delicious. Our waiter Devon was on top of things! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The most courteous hosts, nice waitstaff and excellent breakfast around. The eggs were cooked to perfection, the bacon crisp, just like I like it, and the coffee strong."}
{"text":"Three different visits and each visit became more disappointing. The most recent visit I ordered their veggie omelet and it came and was all egg, very little fillings. On top of that they forgot the hollandaise sauce and toast. Hash browns were barely done. Too many other top notch breakfast spots nearby such as BLD, First Watch and Sunny's to return."}
{"text":"Hubby and I did our morning walk on Saturdays and decided to have breakfast here. It was getting pretty busy around 9ish but the wait wasn't too long 10-15 mins. Tried the farmhouse crepes and they were yummy! Coffee was great and super hot (which makes the coffee taste good). The whole menu looked really good. Our server Kayla (hope that was her name) was super nice and helpful. Entire staff were very friendly. Will definitely be back for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great service from staff and loved the way the cooks and wait staff communicate and food was amazing and hot will be back thanks Michelle for taking care of us."}
{"text":"Solid food with traditional breakfast menu. Nice outdoor patio, fresh decor and very pleasant servers."}
{"text":"Was in the area picking up a farmhouse coffee table  when we did a quick Yelp search for a grub spot, since I love eggs and coffee, I immediately chose to go. 
Was no wait which was good for 1pm on a Sunday, got my coffee and milk right away, while we were looking over the menu. 
We decided on the German Pancake and chicken fried steak with extra crispy hash browns..
Unfortunately the hash browns showed up soggy and minimal gravy on my CFS, the presentation of the poached eggs and sausage with the pancake combo was lackluster, and hard to eat on their own plate.. were they supposed to be on the pancake?? other than that, the Pancake was surprisingly delicious (I thought the lemon wedges looked odd), the food was good and so was the service.. I'll probably come back sometime for the chicken fried steak burger and the crabacado."}
{"text":"Great place. Wonderful open atmosphere. Great location. The food was just amazing. Bacon thick, eggs perfect, the Crapes were great. And you must have the German Pancake its between a American Pancake and Crape, its big but was able to finish all of it, its not heavy."}
{"text":"Fine. Just fine. Food was good, not amazing. I had veggie omelet. Hash browns were average. Didn't have the German pancake. Vibe was a little weird. People were a little odd. Waiter felt scripted. It seemed to take a very lonnnng time for our food to come out. We were hoping to have a great breakfast place in North Scottsdale. This is probably not it."}
{"text":"Food was great. I had the French Toast and my wife had a Denver omelet.  Kids enjoyed their meals especially the strawberry crepes my daughter had. Service was good though the forgot a few items. Patio is great for a early morning breakfast. Only complaint was that the coffee was just so so"}
{"text":"For a lot of breakfast joints, the quality of the bacon is an afterthought...not Egg N' Joe. This is some of the tastiest bacon I've had in a long time. The other part of my experience that was great is finding out they don't charge extra $ for egg whites!!! The only part that was a bit confusing is that you can either pay up front at the cashier or waiter/waitress can be your cashier, not one or the other. Tip: Get there early as this place gets busy FAST, even on weekdays."}
{"text":"Have been here a few times. They often overestimate the wait, which I appreciate. The service has been exceptional. Ask for Gus. The German pancake really is that big and that good. Melts in your mouth. And the omelettes and potato pancakes are out of this world. They don't skimp on ingredients or portions. I have never seen such fresh options for a side of fruit with a breakfast. Ever. Check it out. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"Best Breakfast I've had in long time. Place was busy, but Devon took very good care of me. Good coffee, great flavor in the omelet and that Biscuit oh my fluffy goodness. Next time I have got to try that german pancake!!! wi-fi and misters on the patio."}
{"text":"Good service, good strong coffee and good food. Their coffee is not your watered down Circle K coffee but not as strong as Starbucks. Finally no more runny eggs on the inside of omelletes, they cook their scrambled eggs into a thin tortilla like wrap and then roll the filling. I ordered the crab omellette and the crab is lump crab meat and not the mushy type from the can. Their biscuits are fresh from the oven, moist and not crusty at all. Our server Justin is on point with the service.  I'll eat here again when I get a chance!"}
{"text":"Such a good breakfast place! Had a mimosa, crepes (brought to us for free!) Denver Omelette, hash browns and a side of pancakes. Everything was delicious and came out of the kitchen fresh and ready to eat. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Good atmosphere and a nice place to have breakfast!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot with some unique items on the menu. Went with my parents and we all got something we couldn't get anywhere else in the area and enjoyed our meal. They had self serve coffee and water outside while we waited for our table which was a really nice addition. Only downfall was there was no shade to stand or sit in before we got our table so we walked across the parking lot to get in some shade since it was 95 degrees out."}
{"text":"Fabulous food; a must try is the German pancake, their poached eggs are perfect... Love this place, and the server Justin brings out food when it's still hot- He's awesome!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty neutral when it comes to egg n joe. I wasn't super impressed but I also wasn't unsatisfied. Good place but gets very busy. Get here early if you don't want to wait an hour or two for a table. We got there at 8:45am and still waited a half hour."}
{"text":"I really like the German pancake. Maybe I used the whole butter that was given, and I don't normally eat fatty food, so I felt the greasiness at the last 1/4 of pancake. The clam chowder came warm, not hot at all, but after complaint, the waitress took the item off the bill. Over all, the food was delicious and there was a long line when we went on Saturday brunch."}
{"text":"Truly a disappointment. This place is always busy so we were excited to try it. We went at 10:30 on a Wednesday and the place was not busy by any means but it took the hostess 10 minutes to seat us. Out of an empty restaurant she sat us at a table with a spill around it located right next to a dish loading station. All we could hear was slamming plates from the staff next to us while inhaling bleach fumes from the mop up job. The ownership and management should be embarrassed in regards to how poorly this place is run."}
{"text":"A 45 minute wait on a rainy Saturday afternoon. They supply everyone with coffee while we were waiting. I had the German Pancake combo which came with 2 eggs and a meat (I choose bacon) and my friend had the French Toast which came with her choice of meat (she choose the sausage which she said was excellent). This place was pretty good, food came out in a reasonable amount of time especially given how busy the restaurant was. I would come back and try the oatmeal or a frittata. Thought that was going to be today after Pilates a couple of doors down but there was still a wait at 10am on a Friday morning!"}
{"text":"Went there yesterday 4/3 around 11:30. I ordered the traditional eggs benefits and my wife orders chicken fried steak with salad. Her sandwich was below average, I didn't like my breakfast at all, the hollandaise sauce had no flavor and hash browns were greasy. I ate two bits of my eggs and stopped. Our server Sheryl came to check on us and asked if I want a box without noticing that my plate was still almost full! I informed the server that I didn't like my meal, immediate she went to the manager and came back with the check and said the manager took it off the check. I was not offered any alternative meal nor the manager came over so left the restaurant hungry. Three tables were at the restaurant so the manager was not busy at all. I'm a restaurateur myself and very disappointed in how they handled my issue. The owner needs to get on top of his staff."}
{"text":"Reminds me of growing up in Washington and Oregon, eating at Elmer's Pancake House. This is an Elmer's restaurant with all the flavors and great pancakes - and Ivan's clam chowder!!  Call ahead on weekends because it's worth it."}
{"text":"Joe mak gud eggs so hes a gud boy in my book. JOE if you reading this pleas add options on ur menue  for ppl who enjoy the show friends okay gotta go bye"}
{"text":"The busy breakfast places are usually the best and Egg n Joe is worth the wait. The food was great and the service was amazing. Cory was our waiter and took extremely good care of us. It's hard to find good service and we will definitely be back! Thanks Cory!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast joint. They have fantastic food, wonderful service and did I say fantastic food? I have nothing but great things to say about this place. My family loves going there. Keep up the great work, Egg N' Joe! We love this place!!!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast joint that is pretty close to home.  The omelette was delicious.  Loved the onion and avocado combo.  I do wish that the hash brown portion was a little larger.  Also, I wish there were some gluten free options.  The pancakes looked delicious.

Solid service."}
{"text":"I had been eagerly awaiting a chance to try this place out as soon as it opened.  Well, they proved that good things come to those who wait.  We were promptly greeted by Ilona who was very warm and accommodating.  After sitting at the booth of our choice, we got right to the menu.  For some folks, this may seem like Denny's or IHOP fare but I disagree vehemently!  One thing that blows either of the aforementioned establishments out of the water is the pancakes.  When you go to places like IHOP or Denny's, their pancakes to tend to be a bit heavy.  These pancakes were as light or lighter than the ones we had at JP.  Even without syrup, they had a nice taste.  Once you put the creamy butter and the warmed syrup on them, the tastes literally explode on a different level.

The sausage definitely had that farm fresh taste and the right amount of seasoning.  The eggs were quite fluffy and tasty.  My wife had the rye toast and it had a very nice taste to it as well.  However, no breakfast is complete without a nice cup of joe.  The coffee here is pretty nice but it can have a bit of an edge if you are not used to it.

Our server, Michelle, was very warm and friendly making us feel very special.  Rest assured, we will be returning and bringing some people with us."}
{"text":"Our favorite sit-down breakfast place in Scottsdale! We are from the northwest so we were really excited to see Portland coffee, tilamook cheese, and snoqualmie falls oatmeal!"}
{"text":"Omelette pancakes avocado Benedict Bly omelette and the 3 of us give everything 5 stars
Service good friendly and great attitude in whole place
Big outdoor seating
Good coffee and iced tea too
Will be back bright and clean and cheery"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this restaurant. 
Food was good we had eggs and bacon. Eggs and ham. 2 pancakes the eggs come with hash browns and buttermilk biscuits. Biscuits are really good. Pancakes are good too. I will go there again"}
{"text":"I'm not normally a fan of breakfast but this place is great...everything is fresh & cooked perfect. Service is also great, everyone is very friendly...will definitely go back"}
{"text":"Tried Egg 'n JOE out this morning, a busy rainy Sunday. I called ahead to see how long the wait was and was able to get our name on the list- major score. We were quickly seated and our waitress arrived within minutes to take our drink order, giving us time to look over the menu. 

The menu is a glossy affair with high quality imagery of many of the dishes. I appreciate that the pictures were professional AND the food actually looked like the pictures. The clean white background made everything pop and easy to find. 

We both had crepes, the blueberry banana and a strawberry crepe. You get two crepes per order, made with fresh fruit, whipped cream PLUS two eggs and choice of meat for roughly $10.50 per order. It's a lot of food. The food came out relatively quickly, nicely presented, eggs perfectly cooked. The bacon was crispy and not greasy. My only complaint was that the chicken apple sausage was cold. It had good flavor, wasn't sweet like some apple sausage, just could have been hot or at least warm. 

The menu has a nice selection of omelettes, Benedicts, waffles, pancakes, crepes and other traditional breakfast meals. Egg 'n Joe is doing a nice job turning out food that may be more costly than Denny's, but it really isn't competing in that category. It is fresher and better prepared. We will be back, especially knowing we can call ahead and get on the wait list!"}
{"text":"I had a 2-egg (as opposed to the standard 3 eggs) vegetable omelet (sans the Hollandaise sauce) with a side of fresh fruit and 1 slice of sourdough toast.

The omelet (eggs) were paper thin and dry, though not browned like so many restaurants do when the grill is too hot.  The veggies had been grilled ahead, which gave them a nice texture.  Rather than adding raw chopped tomatoes to the top of the omelet before serving, they would have been a nice addition to the grilled veggies for more flavor.
The fruit was 1/2 of a sliced banana, red grapes and a few chunks of cantaloupe.  All good enough; a little disappointing there were no strawberries since their table top ad says \"We love our strawberries\".  (You can pay extra for them)  Toast was ok; nothing special about the bread.

Good and plentiful flow of tasty coffee.

I think I'll stick to my other 2 favorite spots for breakfast (First Watch and Biscuits Cafe)"}
{"text":"My wife just went in this morning  to place a take out  order. The guy working there said he would not accept her order.  She was told she can only order take out online. What type of restaurant has a moronic policy like that?  Oh yeah, the restaurants that want to make sure no one comes back.  She just wanted to get breakfast and get back to hospital to be her Mom.  We will not be going back."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here on Saturday for brunch. This was our 2nd visit after having a pleasant and delicious 1st visit. This experience was lacking everything. Our server, \"Shelley\" did not show up for about 10 minutes. After finally taking our food order, we waited about 45 minutes, at which point she came back to our table to ask us what we ordered. She seemed confused and distracted and said she 'thought' she put our order in. 15 minutes later we received our food (total time 1 hour from the time we sat down to the time we received our food). However, my friend did not receive the pancakes she ordered with her omelette. Shelley said she would check on it. We were 1/2 way through with our meal before the pancake came. No apology was offered and no effort to make it right. It's a good thing my friend and I had a lot to catch up on or I would have walked out. The food was ok but when you have poor service, it certainly taints the experience. I should have asked to speak to a manager, but didn't.  I have no incentive to come back."}
{"text":"Breakfast is my favorite meal, and I won't go out to eat breakfast unless the cooks at a restaurant can make it better than I can. Egg N Joe made a fantastic first impression on me. Our server was Michelle and she was amazing. We ordered basic items to start with. They have the best restaurant bacon I've ever had; it was thick cut and cooked perfectly. The pancakes were excellent. Portion sizes overall are perfect. I want to go back soon and try the German pancakes."}
{"text":"I looove this resturant!! Excellent service, great food, cute friendly atmosphere! I will definitely be back! I had the blackberry crepes and it was very delicious! Steve is an awesome server, the sweetest, very professional. We even got a welcome letter as first time customers. My new favorite breakfast spot! My mom got the eggs benedict and the hollandaise sauce was not too lemony which is a good thing in my opinion. The food came out hot and promptly. They have big bacon, they aren't chincy with the meats. Eat here, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Great place and great food. Couldn't say enough good things about this place. Food is quick and hot and always right. Share the secret with others."}
{"text":"This place was soooo good - the German pancakes and bacon was amazing!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Strawberry crepe and side of hash brown was awesome!  This place was packed but we got a table w/in 15 minutes.  Fast and friendly service, food was very good.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I was hoping this was going to be good. It was so bad it was terrible, so bland and my chicken fried steak was definitely not fresh, and was so soggy. Chicken fried steak should be crispy. I took one bite and then a 2nd giving it a second chance and could take another. I would say it was frozen with canned gravy. My wife couldn't even finish her omelette it was that bad and tasteless. It also took about 35 min to get our food. When I looked at the menu I felt like I was looking and Denny's menu. The cheesy pictures of the food and basic boring stuff. Filled with older people also inside that was the 1st red flag, 2nd was Denny's style picture menu. We will not be back. Should have went to Soul Cafe or The breakfast joint, but we thought Soul Cafe would be packed so we went here also hoping for another good Breakfast place but sadly it was not."}
{"text":"We love Egg n Joe! Bright, cute restaurant with an inviting patio - complete with mountain views!  Food is delicious with choices ranging from crepes to skillets to giant German pancakes. I go there for the hash browns. They are thicker cut than most which makes them far less greasy. Shelly S was our server this morning and she was great with her customers, young and old alike!  A cheerful disposition like hers makes a good visit great!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty nice. The servers were attentive and the place had a breakfast place kind of vibe to it. FYI they serve lunch here also, surprisingly they had clam chowder and it actually surprised me it was pretty tasty. The wife had a bacon burger but she said it was a little dry, to me it looked juicy, didn't try it though. It was time to taste the German pancake everyone was raving about. We ordered the Maple and apple and yes it tasted as good as it sounds, this place is a must try."}
{"text":"This was one of the best breakfast joints I ever ate out at. Our server, Brooke, was very attentive and joyful and we will be coming back for breakfast tomorrow. The food was just delightful."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfasts and delicious mimosas too! We had never been here before and our server extraordinaire, Tara, gave us the VIP treatment. The crab omelette was amazing and later she brought us a German pancake to try.  My husband is German and has made them himself and wanted to compare recipes. It was yummy! We will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Nice atmosphere and fantastic service.  Gus is an amazing server.  My wife and I thought he is probably the best we've ever had anywhere and that includes fancy restaurants .  For me, it's all about the small details.  He was personable but didn't chat too much.  He was also very respectful.  Every time he stopped by, he removed clutter from our table.  

Food was delicious but slightly skimpy.  I anticipated this and ordered a side of toast.

My daughter asked for pancakes that were pictured with sprinkles.  When they were served the sprinkles were missing.  Gus quickly brought us some sprinkles before she had a tantrum.

Coffee was good.  I'm glad to have another breakfast option in Gilbert.  The others places have crazy long wait times.

Gus highly recommended the fish and chips which we'll try next time."}
{"text":"First visit. 

This is basically similar to an iHop type breakfast experience. Feels like a chain. 

Sat outside in the 100 degree heat. Asked politely twice if they could please turn on the patio water misters (which were off). 

\"Sure, no problem!\" The waiter happily replied. Twice I asked 

Never happened. 

Food was very mediocre. My grapefruit juice tasted like from a mix rather than fresh. Sugary sweet red syrupy liquid. Scrambled eggs not fluffy but more of a layer of egg on a pan that got rolled onto itself. Avocado served on the side was hard as a rock (unripe) and brown on edges like it was sitting out. 

Hash browns were good. Nobody ever asked if my food was good. Nobody ever refilled my empty water. 

This place is nothing. Won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Came with my mom and brother and we all loved the food here. Their potato pancakes are to die for, their pancakes don't suffer from that typical too-dry-to-enjoy symptom that too oft plagues good breakfast restaurants, their bacon strips were smoked to perfection, and their lingonberry crepes are fluffy as f**k. I am definitely coming back here with my friends!"}
{"text":"35 minute wait on Memorial Day, the restaurant was packed. This was our first time and we tried the crabacado omelette, avocado Benedict, and sun devil skillet. The food was good and the service all right. Would have preferred a quieter environment and a side booth, but it was busy so all things considered, a 4/5 star joint."}
{"text":"Working out the kinks. Their opening weekend Saturday was about a 20 min wait to be seated. Not bad considering the crowd that was waiting outside. Once seated took about 15 min from time we ordered to time food arrived. I ordered the classic eggs Benedict. My wife ordered the German pancake combo with apples. Both were very satisfying. Hint: the Apple chicken sausage is definitely worth the upgrade for the combo. Coffee was bold and fresh. Service was a bit uninspiring. Waitress seemed very unenthusiastic especially for opening weekend. Asked for refill on creamer, never got it. Just someone going through the motions. Food great, service subpar. All other servers looked peppy and energetic. Will definitely try again!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast! Went there with my daughter a few weeks ago.  I got the cinnamon roll pancakes and they were awesome. Scrambled eggs and potatoes were also great as well and they have amazing bacon!"}
{"text":"Their name is appropriate because both the eggs and coffee are great! I love the crepes and pancakes as well. Glad to have a good breakfast spot in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Came on a Sunday morning with the family. Service was quick and friendly and the food was good.  Would come again for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome.   The Germann pancake is crazy good and the staff is always so very friendly.   We love coming here!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Pancakes are delicious. It was crowded for a weekday so I don't think I'll try it on a weekend. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"I love breakfast food and couldn't wait to try this place out with my wife. The customer service is friendly. The only downfall we had was the slow service to our table. It looked like all the other tables had fast service.  We watched 3 tables get seated after we ordered and watched all three tables get there food before us. If you do go here, I recommend ordering one of their German pancakes. We got the German pancake with lingonberry butter which is the main reason why we will keep going back. It is really good. I also like the fact that they have vanilla creamer for coffee upon request."}
{"text":"Not a great experience when we went because our food took almost an hour - and we were served faster than the guy next to us, who walked out.  
Server was courteous but we also waited a long time for a coffee refill and the check.   
The wrong order was brought out and partially replaced.  We did not request replacing the other part cause by now we'd been waiting over an hour.  The eggs Benedict (the only correct order) had very little sauce, which had no flavor anyway and the 2 eggs were cooked differently - just weird and certainly not a $10-quality meal. 
At first I thought they must be short-handed but no, at least 8 servers, 2 managers and a bunch of them hovering over schedules with a manager while people are waiting over 40 minutes for the wrong food.  That's just poor management.
I don't usually have 2 hours to kill for the wrong breakfast order or subpar food and there are several faster and better quality options nearby so I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Great quick breakfast place, food is great and service is awesome. Quick to serve even when it's packed. Also have healthy options for my specialized diet. 

They have outdoor patio seating (with both heaters for the winter and misters/fans for the rest of the year). Very clean since it's still new. Been back twice in the last couple weeks."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant I have been to in a while, other than the entrance being congested everything else was superb.  The bacon, eggs, hash browns, sausage & gravy were completely fresh and delicious as if it was made at home.  You walk in to the restaurant and get the diner feel with a modern twist.  The seasonal fruit was perfect!  The coffee let me tell you I love my coffee and this coffee was awesome it had great taste.  My husband had the chicken fried steak and it was amazing the steak and the breading was all freshly done nothing frozen.  Our waiter guys made us feel right at home and not pressured even though we can see that the entire restaurant was almost full.  He continued to check on us throughout our meal to ensure we did not wait for anything that we needed and did so with all the rest of his customers as well.  I will definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I am visiting my grandmother in Arizona and she keep raving about Egg N' Joe calling it her spot. So naturally we decided to go visit the day afterwards. We had the door opened for us by bright,cheerful young man named Ethan. On the east coast I have never witnessed this kind of hospitality, it was almost like he was excited to serve us. After being seated Justin came quickly over and and knew my grandmother by name. That was awesome to see, like my grandmother had a home away from home. We order out food and had the most amazing cup of coffee. The food came out and was fantastic. My grandmother order the German pancake and I could believe she ate the entire helping!! She loved it! Myself I had the crab omelet, superb! Ethan came back over to check on the food. Extremely considerate. He also knew my grandmother by name and she actually was raving about this Ethan saying how nice he is day in and day out. It's an amazing feeling that my grandmother is in such good hands while she is alone. The egg n joe experience was one to remember and was absolutely made by the two young men that assisted us. We will absolutely be back again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast.  Very courteous at the front at seating us.  Then we had Michelle as our server and everything continued to be wonderful.  I've never had someone refill a drink so quickly.  Thank you very much for that.  Breakfast was good and my wife loves the German pancake.  Thank you for breakfast Michelle."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, environment, the German Pancake is outstanding, great coffee"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for German pancakes. I ordered the German pancake combo with Lingonberry butter.  The meal did not disappoint. I would recommend to anyone in the east valley."}
{"text":"Visited Egg N'Joe on a Saturday morning. Anticipating a wait, we called ahead to get our name on the list. We were pleasantly surprised to be seated immediately upon arrival. 

The decor is very \"coffee shop\" like, it's clean and bright. The menu offers typical breakfast fare. 

Knife and I each got omelettes (Farmers for Knife and Crabacado for me).  They were tasty!  A choice of fresh fruit or hash browns is offered; we both asked for extra crispy hash browns. Sadly the hash browns we got only had a few crispy strands. (An additional star would have been given for crispy hash browns.) A biscuit also comes with the omelette, it was a typical run of the mill biscuit. 

The service was fast, the food was hot and tasty and I recommend trying this new breakfast/lunch spot in North Scottsdale!

{"text":"Great food and nice place. They made a small mistake and more than made up for it. Always great to see places take care of customers on their own accord when mistakes happen. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It is a nice, clean establishment.  The workers are friendly.    Our server had some type of issue, as he left during his shift.  I attribute the poor service to personal issue. He didn't bring my full order (added eggs and sausage to my order - he just brought the crepes) and the crepes were very overcooked (lingonberry).  My daughter ordered apple crepes which were soft and perfectly cooked.  I give it a three because the manager took my complaint about food being overcooked in stride.  He agreed when he looked at it.  Also that I had not been given my full order.   He was kind enough to not charge me for the food (which I hardly ate) and also gave me a coupon to return for a free meal.  So that bumped it up.  I'll try them again."}
{"text":"We had a short wait but worth it. The quality is very good and the prices reflect the quality. They are on the high side for breakfast. We had the avocado eggs Benedict and a Ham and cheese omelette. Both were very tasty.  The fruit was fresh and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast menu, gracious, friendly service by Justin. Excellent German pancake with triple berry coulis. Comfortable booth. I wish Egg N Joe a lot of success in their first U.S location. Visit to table my general manager Theresa to say hello and check on us was a nice touch"}
{"text":"Great food.. wonderful service!!  You know if is a good place when each of the waitresses come over to oogle over the baby at a table nearby.  Great to see the smiles on everyone's faces.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We've been here twice in two weeks. The Host even Welcomed us back! Asked how we were!
Today's breakfast of the egg, bacon,and ham crepes w hollandaise sauce was wonderful. It comes w hash browns (which are magnificent btw) but I substituted fresh fruit. Really fresh fruit! Banana, grapes and sweet cantaloupe. 
Hubby got the Hungry Rancher. Huge breakfast. We will split his next time! Beautiful eggs over medium, cheesie hash browns, bacon a huge ham steak and a biscuit. He loved it. The link sausage was super. 
And the coffee is nice and strong. 
Perfect in every way. They even ask if you want coffee to go!"}
{"text":"This is for sure going to be one of my go to breakfast spots. It's a cute place with awesome staff. I went around 9 AM and was able to get a seat right away on a Friday but around 10 AM it started getting busy so people had to wait, just an FYI. It seems that the place tends to get busy but hello that's not a bad thing, it's actually a good sign. 

Try the cinnamon roll pancakes, you won't regret it - trust me!"}
{"text":"Yummy, yummy! Enjoyed our brekkies here a handful of times already and we will keep stopping by. The first couple of times I would give 5+ stars because of excellent service, quick movement and friendly faces. The last couple of times, more younger faces manning the floor and they are not as efficient movers. Some like to talk and chat behind the partition, some break out their phone for a quick look, and others forget that you are patrons there where your visit for 45 mins came with a one stop of a coffee or water refill. 4 stars for the food like my favorite crabacado omelette & huge German pancakes."}
{"text":"We just ate a late breakfast here, was amazing.  The service was great.  You have to try the German Pancake, it is very good.  We ordered a few things and shared them.  We will be back."}
{"text":"One of my new fave breakfast spots that seems to get it right all the time. Really delicious egg white omelets and pancakes. Yum. Coffee is ok too if it's fresh.  Sort of depends which server you get but 80% of the servers are pleasant and positive."}
{"text":"Disappointing on so many levels!   Came here to try the German pancakes.  Not good enough to make up for all the other issues.  Arrived about 10 am.  Told it would be 40 mins yet they had 5 tables open out on patio.  Turned out to be an hour.  Once seated it still took 5 mins to get coffee and 30 mins to get our meal 
For a place with this name the coffee should be good and flowing.  It wasn't!  The eggs were undercooked.  Not over medium.  Crispy hash-browns weren't and the portions small. Omelette was dry and poorly made.  And service never improved.  And still no coffee refills.  With employees standing around.  
2 people for a $42 breakfast... unbelievable. 
Next time,skip it and go to Denny's"}
{"text":"Won't be back.  LOUD and chaotic atmosphere......not a place to have a conversation over breakfast.  Food could be better.  The potato pancakes were heavy and greasy and the hash browns were mushy.  But hey, if you want a place where kids are permitted to run around and scream their heads off, this is the place for you.  I guess I prefer a more refined dining experience. Emily's cafe down the street is a much better option."}
{"text":"Breakfast was very good, but the service was not so good.  We liked the server he was very nice but seemed so confused.  We asked for flavored creamer got regular, asked for very dark toast came nearly toasted, asked for no bananas in fruit bowl, got bananas, asked for a to-go cup of coffee, didn't get it.  This is the third time we've eat here and the service is the same each time - NOT THAT GOOD!"}
{"text":"The wait was way too long and the food came out cold so we were very disappointed but we let them know our feedback and they gave our meal for free. They were definitely understanding and their service made up for it."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, however it is a little pricy for the amount of food you get. The service is fantastic though!"}
{"text":"This is just a different shell on a terrible restaurant chain. I went here hoping I would get something new and fun for breakfast that would tantalize the pallet. Instead I got a less fulfilling meal then I could have got at a Blythe arizona Dennys. Stay away from this boring breakfast."}
{"text":"Meh. Was excited to try this place, unfortunately, I knew what I was in for as soon as I opened the menu :/ 

There was nothing special about the entree selections. Eventually, I opted for coffee (black like always) and the Veggie Omelette with a side of pancakes, wifey had the German Pancake and niece had the Eggs Benedict.

Here's the breakdown:

Coffee : tasted burnt. I admitted to the wife and niece yesterday's Keurig cup was way better than this, I'm probably gonna have heartburn from it after a couple cups, but today is moving day and I need my caffeine!

My omelette : was just as I expected - average. I've had a tastier omelette at Denny's at 3am. 

Pancakes : I'm a huge pancake fan and so I had to try theirs. On the outside, they had the golden color that says, \"cooked to perfection\", however, the inside was a different story. The flavor was good, but it was one of those types that felt grainy and dry on the inside. 2 Forks down.  

German Pancake : was bland with a hint of what we could only deem as egg noggy. On the upside, the chicken sausage that came with the meal was yummy. 

Eggs Benedict : I didn't actually try them but according to niece she said they were good - but nothing special. 

Service : I've had better service in the men's bathroom at any given club in Old Town - wait, that doesn't sound right, but seriously folks, I was excited to try this place out, unfortunately, it's not a place I'd recommend or return to."}
{"text":"Great tasting and healthy breakfast! Entire staff was warm and friendly. Christine was a fantastic server- one of the best we've ever had. Overall, Well worth the 30 minute wait."}
{"text":"My husband and I came to this new breakfast place. And we are very pleased with the service Gus has given us. He was very friendly. We ordered German pancake with porched egg combo and skillet with grilled chicken and jalapeño. Everything was delicious! Perfect brunch!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, Service was amazing! I had the Sun Devil Skillet and my husband had the Valley of the sun omelet and both were great!!! Prices were pretty good but Angela our server at the Gilbert location was amazing! Very kind and on top of things. We sat out on the patio and she never let us feel forgotten! Servers like Angela make me sad I pay 20 percent other places. Thanks for a great brunch experience!"}
{"text":"Perfect breakfast spot. Great food and customer service... When you make sure to leave room for German pancakes ( simply delicious)."}
{"text":"Food is good, service was ok.  I ordered a vanilla cappuccino, waaaay too sweet.  There were a few hiccups in service, but they apologized and gave us a cut off the bill. I do recommend this place. My kids loved it, next time we will try the German pancake. It's a little pricey, but reasonably filling. I didn't leave hungry."}
{"text":"The staff is friendly and attentive. The have coffee outside for people waiting, which is very nice. The German pancakes are good, I would recommend the original flavor, the berries option was alright. Also, if you want some mimosas, it's cheaper to get a carafe of mimosas than two individual mimosas!"}
{"text":"Good breakfast.  The crab eggs Benedict is awesome.  Be nice if they had better coffee."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Seems like they try very hard to be different but don't focus on the important stuff. Food was mediocre and service was sub par. I called ahead and was placed on a list for a wait. This wasn't a problem because when I got there, I received a pager and was told I had only 1 ahead of me on the list. Once I was sat the server had a smile which you could tell was forced and after taking my drink order I saw her flirting with another server in the back. The manager came by later in the meal and was very keen on trying to be my friend even though I was still trying to eat my food and could be seen trying to just enjoy the half decent meal I was given. From looking around at the people that work here, very few actual look like they enjoy their job, or even want to work there. 100% would not recommend to other people looking for a place to eat. The only claim to fame is the german pancake which to be frank was nothing more than a crepe or a flakey pie crust. If I had to go again I'd probably just go to village inn."}
{"text":"very good breakfast! very good service! clean and attractive interior!
solid spot, and judging how crowded it was on a week day morning I'm not the only one who liked it."}
{"text":"I thought that everyone was very nice and happy to see us. With the newness comes someone at the door welcoming you. The atmosphere is very inviting. We went for breakfast. The food was very good. I wasn't thrilled with the eggs. But everything else was great, and plenty of food. I had a waffle with Ham and eggs. And he had a chicken fried steak. I can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience at eggs and Joe. Good service, good coffee, creamer eggs Benedict and crapes. Renovations look great. Very kind and I will be back again. Good prices and location. I would like to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is below average. It serves a very plain menu. They serve pillsbury biscuits, ocean spray juice, and other grocery store items. Nothing exceptional, but not horrible flavor. Everyone was a bit less than satisfied with their meal. Would not recommend the crepes."}
{"text":"What I love about chandler/gilbert area is that we have one of the best breakfast places here in Arizona! This spot just opened and its 10 mins away from where I live. Love it! Our server Michelle was awesome. Always had a smile on her face and greeted us. My bf and I had their strawberry crepes, stuffed hashbrowns, and eggs benny. We waited about 20 mins because something in their kitchen broke down. The manager and our server Michelle both apologized to us telling us that they are doing their best to get our meals to us asap due to that. I was amazed and felt significant. I couldnt get mad because they apologized and told has what had happened. Most restaurants wont even bother telling us what problems they have and why our food is taking so long. I appreciated them for letting us know and the manager also took $10 off our bill for waiting. Once we received our food. The wait was all worth it! Everything we have ordered was satisfying and marvelous! Michelle said if theres anything you both need let me know, I will be here with a smile! Thank you for the amazing breakfast and service . Thats what us customers come back for. Will be back. Great place!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim from out of town (CA) My son was getting married nearby but I was dying for breakfast. The food and the service was great!"}
{"text":"Had the bacon avocado egg white omelette which was delicious and the coffee was just so-so but for a place that should be known for their coffee, so they couod improve this. Because it's so close I will probably be back again to try the German pancake mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I stopped here on Easter Sunday so I was a little fearful that it would be too crowded.  While there was a good group of people here, it was not uncomfortable.   This restaurant is fairly new, so I didn't expect to be overwhelmed. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The dining area is large and there is a small compliment of patio chairs and tables.  I was seated immediately on the patio and it was very nice.  The chairs were comfortable, the view was absolutely beautiful, and the tables were very nice as well.

Service:  I was served by two, Janet and Sandi.   Both women were very attentive, and I never had to go looking for them.  Almost immediately after being seated, I was offered both water and coffee.   Only a couple minutes later Sandi took my order. Because it was so crowded, I thought that it would be awhile, but Janet brought my food within five minutes of ordering.  Surprise!!

Throughout my meal, the coffee and water were refilled without request I was never empty on either cup or glass.  Just before I finished, Janet dropped my check off.  It was nice to see these two work so closely together to make sure the customer was happy.  I'm sure the manager appreciates the teamwork, and realizes how well it reflects on both him and the restaurant.

FOOD:  I ordered a simple breakfast; 2 eggs, biscuits, potatoes, and bacon. First of all,  let me tell you the bacon was tremendous. Thick strips of bacon, cooked to perfection. I ordered my eggs over-easy and that is exactly how they came.  (it is astonishing how often restaurants get this wrong). 
 
As for the biscuit it could have been cooked a little bit more for my taste. The inside was just a little mushy.  But I slapped some butter on it and it was very good!  The hash browns were excellent. Browned and cooked well on the outside while still fresh on the inside, they were just  like Mom's at home.

COFFEE:  The coffee at this place was absolutely delicious.  Served in an attractive green cup, brewed to perfection, the aroma was rich, and the taste was both smooth and bold.  I would return here for the coffee experience alone.

 
So for under 15 bucks, tip included, I got a real good breakfast, fantastic coffee, bacon to die for, all served by two terrific ladies, Janet and Sandi.  

Go have breakfast here, you will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Easter Sunday, less than 10 minutes waiting, wonderful service and absolutely delicious food. Best brunch around."}
{"text":"Dont bother, long wait, small menu with average food. Dennys has more options. There are several other places within 2 miles that are far better. Disappointed"}
{"text":"Menu has options, but nothing outside of your Denny's/diner. Coffee and service solid. Did order there signature German Pancake....like a spread out crepe. Average at best."}
{"text":"First time here and definitely will return. All of the wait staff were incredibly nice and attentive to the customers. We got the German pancake combo and valley of the sun omelet. They were both amazing."}
{"text":"Clean, great service, food was hot and timely. At 9am there was a little wait, but worth it. Good variety on their menu, they have a Huge German Pancake to die for!!  Good value and I will be back."}
{"text":"Service is very good. Fast and food prepared correctly. My wife had the crepes and she really liked them. I had the German pancake, very very good. Not quite as good as the ones that they have Richard Walkers pancake house. However I now don't have to fly to San Diego just to get my German pancake fix. We will be back."}
{"text":"I tried the Springtime Benedict and hubby tried the Sun Valley Skillet. Both were excellent and had very fresh ingredients. The skillet did not have any grease, as is typical of most chorizo dishes. Coffee was strong but smooth with a little creamer. Would definitely go back if we are in the area again. The outside seating was very pleasant and the service was good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Wednesday morning and there was no wait. We got a lot of food (Belgian Waffle, French toast, two orders of hash browns, two orders of eggs, and two orders of bacon) for only $30, which I felt like was a great deal. 

We enjoyed everything tremendously. Service was great as well, and food came out quickly. Our literal only complaint was that when we were asked if we wanted cheese with our scrambled eggs, we expected the cheese to be mixed in, but it was just sitting cold on top. Kind of odd, but the eggs themselves were cooked well. 

Overall very pleased. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was great!  I did go on a Sunday morning so the service was a bit slower but I understand how Sunday mornings can be, I'm a server at a breakfast joint too.  The server was very sweet and accommodating and my French toast was amazing! The sausage is excellent here and the French toast I had was bigger than what you might get at a different restaurant, I love the thicker style.  Now the layout of the restaurant seems small so if you expect to get seated right away with anything more than 6 people in your party then good luck.  Overall I had a great experience and leftovers afterwards!"}
{"text":"Fast service, very good food! I had the avocado Benedict and fruit, and it had a lot of flavor!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to go after grocery shopping. Given the typical American food selection and decor, didnt expect much. Happy to report I was wrong. The prices are fantastic- $20 for two people, and the food was awesome. As a vegetarian, the usually limited veg options aren't always fresh tasting (almost as if an after thought on a menu). My boyfriend and I split the avocado eggs benedict and the veggie skillet. The eggs benedict was PERFECTLY poached and creamy and fresh. The skillet actually was full of FRESH and plentiful veggies (not the usual 3 obligatory pieces amongst a sea of eggs). The hashbrowns were done well without being drenched in oil or burnt. This place thrilled a lazy gal enough to write a review! Will be going again for sure."}
{"text":"Ok first time here. I had the German pancake and babyyyyyyyy it brought back many memories of being back home. I savior every bite. It was like a taste of heaven. The service was wonderful. This was a breakfast I enjoyed with my eyes close. Delicious"}
{"text":"Conveniently located near the San Tan Village this is a great place to catch brunch while spending your day at the mall. We stopped here on a Sunday morning before church. There was plenty open tables, but a wait by the time we finished. The atmosphere is that of a family restaurant. The wait staff were all touting shirts with their favorite NFL team. Our waitress had an AZ Cardinal shirt (Yay).
I was hoping there were some lighter options on the menu, but decided to go with the bacon & Tillamook potato cakes. These are Griddle-browned potato pancakes filled with bacon, Tillamook® Cheddar cheese and onions topped with sour cream. The dish also came with 3 slices of thick cut bacon and 2 eggs your way. 
My order was out in a short time. The pancakes were perfectly fried to a deep golden brown and the cheese melted to gooey scrumptiousness. The bacon, onions, and sour cream complimented the dish well. The bacon and scrambled eggs were average as far as bacon and scrambled eggs go. 
The pancakes were the highlight of this meal. The over all experience rates 3 stars for these reasons: 
1. The menu had little choice for a lighter fare. This was offset by the tastiness of the pancakes.
2. There was bacon in the dish so 3 slices were not neecessary as a side. A small fruit bowl would have been more appropriate.
3. The service was good. My coffee cup was never empty, however the price was higher than average. 
I'm not beating cheeks back here, but there is no reason I wouldn't return. This place is A-OK."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying something new and different in the East Valley. First time at Egg N Joe. Place was very clean and open seating. Ordered the Classic Eggs  Benedict with fresh fruit and light Hollandaise Sauce.

All was good, except the Eggs Benedict were over cooked. This is a signature dish so clearly a disapointment. Flavors were good however, ended up with  Egg McMuffins  with Hollandaise Sauce.

Coffee and fruit were good, service was exceptional. Some of the other menu choices looked good. However still looking for that something new and different in the East Valley."}
{"text":"Very fun atmosphere and great food! They serve a classic breakfast menu with fun twists. I can't wait to go back and try they're jumbo pancakes!"}
{"text":"We took our family out for breakfast, and the employees, service, and food is exceptional! We went on Easter, so they were very busy. Even so, the service was friendly, they didn't rush us, and the food was AMAZING!! They even gave each of the kids an Easter egg with a small chocolate inside, which the kids loved! It's the little things that sometimes make a lasting impression. The entire experience went smoothly, and we will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Well, we really like the food, BUT, it is taking waaaaay too long. People that came in after us, way after us, have already ate and left. Big groups small groups, doesn't matter. It shouldn't take an hour, after ordering the food to get it to us. I'm not a needy person, but I don't think it takes an hour to process the food. Not too happy with the service."}
{"text":"This is an adorable \"mom and pop\" shop. It's bright interior and cheery atmosphere are perfect to wake you up in the morning. :) My mom and I shared the vegetable skillet. The hash browns and veggies were a perfect combination. My mom enjoyed the eggs, from the skillet, and had an English muffin. We both left full and happy. Our sever was very accommodating and friendly. We will certainly be back for more yummy breakfasts!"}
{"text":"Happened upon it just after it opened, excellent breakfast! And Joseph gave great service."}
{"text":"I had just cycled over 30 miles and was HUNGRY!  When greeted at the host station, I was informed of a 30+ minute wait.  Sensing my impending glycemic meltdown, Michael, grabbed a menu and said that since I am dining single, he could seat me, if I don't mind outdoors.  Bless his heart... he wanted to seat me at a four top.  I asked about a two, on the other side of the patio, of which he didn't want to seat me as it had not been cleaned.  Oh please!  You're doing ME a favor, and I can't wait a minute for you to clean a couple plates to save THAT table for four?  How kind was he?  I sat at the smaller table.  Thank you, Michael.  

I wasn't at my table but two mouthfuls of water when my server, Michelle, arrived.  A simple order of three eggs, over medium, ham and hash browns.  I SWEAR!  My order arrived in ~ five minutes.  The eggs were IMPECCABLY cooked, INDIVIDUALLY, NOT together in a pan.  The food was hot and amazing.  

THANK YOU!  I shall return.  Out of five stars, I award you TEN!!!

Sincerely, 

Tristen Xavier"}
{"text":"Horrible establishment.   Went on a Saturday morning , I asked for first available .  Arrived at 930, I was advised there was a 30 min wait.  I noticed there were 5 open tables outside that they were not seating.  At 1005 , I asked the hostess how much longer.   Asked if I could sit outside.   He said there's still people waiting ahead of me.   Now there are those 5 empty tables plus 4 un-bussed tables.  25 min go by.   Still no change.  5 unseated tables and 4 un-bussed tables.  At 1030 I complained to the manager.  All she could say is sorry.   No compensation , she didn't offer to get a table ready.   Horrible  customer service.."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Fluffy omelets, delicious chicken sausage and crepe. Nice atmosphere, very good coffee. The lunch menu looked great too!"}
{"text":"Egg N' Joe is a nice change from the mind numbing offerings of First Watch.  I had the best biscuit I have ever had in my life (I am from Indiana and have had some good biscuits) at Egg N' Joe.  The staff are nice and obliging in splitting a plate for an elderly patron.  The only downfall is the layout of the restaurant.  They don't have much of a lobby.  When they have a large wait - if you are sitting by the front door you are blasted with cold or hot air depending on the season.  Also, DO NOT allow them to sit you at the booth that is just adjacent to the hostess desk - people that are waiting for their table lean against that booth and are basically hovering over your head.  Coughing, shouting and basically being rude as you are trying to eat.  I will say, once I brought the issue to the host's attention he quickly asked the patrons to move which I greatly appreciated :)

I recommend !!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  They have the best German pancakes around.  I've tried them all, but my all time favorite is the Classic with lemon and butter.  They source all their ingredients from the NW area.  This is my to-go spot for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"I had to try their German pancake; I like trying new things. It was impossible to eat with a fork though. I recommend using your hands as it requires tearing. It tasted too doughy to me; I probably go back to eating regular pancakes. I also asked for no butter but it came out with butter. Otherwise the service was great. I returned another time to try their crepes minus cream cheese. It was delicious. My companion tried their crab eggs Benedict and said it was little on the dry side because it had too much crab...not sure if that's good or bad. We also tried their omelette which was very good. Their portion size is huge, so go hungry. I will return to try their other menu items; they have very extensive menu."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Beautiful interior and exterior seating. Love that there was coffee available while you wait. The GM Candi was amazing. She was very personable while we waited the short 15 minute wait for our table. She also popped in and around the restaurant while we ate and cheerfully interacted with customers. 

Our server Kellie was top notch. She provided clarity on menu and ordering options. She even recommended an option for my hash browns that I'd not seen on the menu- loaded hash browns! They were cooked crisp with bacon, chives, butter and sour cream. All 6 of us loved our food. 

Random not breakfast related food option for lunch was the most amazing fish? Crazy Right?!? Hand breaded fresh Cod. Candi overheard us joking about ordering it for breakfast because I've been crazing good fish and she brought us an order as our breakfast appetizer and it was as bomb.com.

Overall top notch addition to the area. 

We were so impressed with Kellie that my wife and I have considered going back just to offer her a job to come work for our business."}
{"text":"Our brunch was delicious, we'll be back!
1.  Potato Pancake
2. Crab Benedict
3. Dutch Pancake

 Would get them all again!"}
{"text":"Happened to walk in on their official opening day. We were greeted by a warm and welcoming staff and as soon as we sat down, we were offered a delicious German pancake.  We ordered the country fried steak and the potato pancakes.  Both were excellent! The coffee is great too! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super excited to have a quality place in this area!!! The orange juice is fresh and delicious!  The coffee is bold with great flavor.  I added 'the works' to my hashbrowns and it was delicious and fresh!!!! I had classic eggs Benedict and it was perfection. My 80 yr old dad was so delighted with how beautiful the place was and really enjoyed his biscuit and 'valley of the sun' omelet. The staff was very attentive and I'm super excited to try the patio with the gorgeous mountain views. Plenty of parking too. Love love love. And can't wait to try lunch. Yes, free wireless too!!!! Try it! #eggnjoe. If you're from Portland you may know their restaurants as Elmer's. One last thing.... The pricing on the menu is very reasonable. Kid friendly too. We will be back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok if you don't want to wait in line and get mediocre food ! This is more of a Denny's then a made from scratch place . The good seems to be pre made would not recommend."}
{"text":"First time here met our grand daughter and her boyfriend. We were greeted with a big welcome and seated right away. Our server Cory could not have been nicer and made sure my wife who is in a wheelchair got special service. The five of us each ordered different meals and we were all very satisfied and full. Great place worth the trip"}
{"text":"Not good food. Frozen hash browns. Artificial eggs. Powder ice tea. I should of stayed home and made a real breakfast myself with real ingredients. I think the only reason this place was busy is because there is no other breakfast places around."}
{"text":"Family was in town so we did a day trip. Lunch time came so we said let's try something different. We ate at Egg and Joe in Scottsdale and what a treat it was. Everyone in our group loved there food and my Fish n Chips was full of flavor. From the owner to Tara the waitress they were absolutely delightful to dine with. It is a must stop if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Good service, quality menu choices in a bright and sunny atmosphere! Prices were a bit high when there are other options close... worth a try!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. Food was good but nothing that you would crave. Overall, solid breakfast spot."}
{"text":"My food reviews generally go straight to the meal. This one's different ... as our first visit to Egg 'n' Joe began with CISCO greeting us at the door. He couldn't have been more welcoming and we were immediately seated and coffee / juice tended to. Even before he left, CAROLINA (\"C\") was there to answer questions about the menu and take our order. 5 stars alone for them making us feel totally \"at home\" and welcome.

Now, will the food hold up to the expectations? I'm totally a breakfast guy. Usually eggs benedict when I go out, but a good omelette can change my mind. Visiting the southwest, avocado makes anything a contender.

Home run with the Crabacado Omelette topped with hollandaise! Whoa, that was awesome - and filling. My sister had something equally good, but I was so focused on my own I really didn't pay her any attention.

No Egg 'n' Joe's near me ... but I'll be back this fall when I'm in AZ again. Go see the gang; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Great food and never on a wait unlike snooze. Quality food, if you're from Washington you'll really like this place because it's exactly like Elmer's. Wonderful servers as well very patient and nice."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place. Service was a bit slow but well worth it. The potato cakes were amazing."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time slowest service around and we didn't even get seated. . Waited over an hour while there was five open tables on the patio. Larger groups getting sat before others. While we waited an hour a table was sat and never received their food. 2 hours, if you were to eat there, is unacceptable for some damn eggs."}
{"text":"Such a great spot! One of the best in Chandler. The food was delicious and the selection easily beats the competition. I very much enjoyed eating here but more than that appreciated the wonderful customer service. Cisco took great care of our table and our Server Kelly was delightful. Thank you!"}
{"text":"So sad. Almost $40 for breakfast. 

Received subpar food, crappy service and burnt coffee."}
{"text":"My daughter, her two young children, and I enjoyed a delicious breakfast at Egg N Joe's last week. The difference on this visit was we had the pleasure of being served by Tarik. This was his first day on the job and he was excellent! He took care of our every need expediently and was very sweet to the children. He had a brilliant smile and made us feel welcome. He was a pleasure.

{"text":"Not easy to find as it is located on Pinnacle Peak Road more than Scottsdale Rd.

Had the German Pancakes meal with Eggs and Sausage. One if the pancakes was with Strawberries and the other plain.

The German Pancakes were more like crepes but were very good. Along with that we had eggs and sausage which were good. 

It was good to try something new and different. 

We arrived later in the afternoon so we were seated right away,  have heard that it could be busy trying to get a table during regular prime hours."}
{"text":"Two words... customer service. My husband and I went to try them out this morning. We are aware there is typically a wait at 10:30 am for any breakfast spot on a Sunday morning. We were told a 20 to 30 minute wait. No problem. We were given a reservation holder. We were excited to try this place out and hungry! 
    After 25 minutes my husband went to go check and the Manager told us it would be another 25 to 35 minute wait because they just hit the lunch crowd.... Say what!? Made no sense to me or him. And we werent going to wait a whole hour. It's not Disneyland. 
    So poor customer service from the front door. I can only imagine what the service is like on the inside."}
{"text":"Wow!  Do it!  We just found my new favorite breakfast place in Phoenix.   Elmer's staff in Palm Springs tipped us into Egg N joes.  Same menu.  Same great food!!!   Love it!!!

The picture is the cinnamon roll pancakes.  Great stuff!

Bacon is delicious.  Eggs are served warm and cooked to order.   

Expect this place to be busy as it gets discovered."}
{"text":"We love going here for breakfast!  The girls who work here are always so nice, great service, they remember what we order and most importantly: it's always done right.  Every time.  If there were a mistake, they'd fix it I'm sure.  But the food is always well made, hit, fresh, and consistent.  Many other restaurants should strive for this, because it's truly what keeps us coming back time after time.  Remember, we can get food anywhere... Egg and Joe make us want theirs."}
{"text":"Clear management issues.

The following issues, very clearly a result of poor management, have been observed multiple times:

-When waiting, the staff will seat larger parties first.  If there is a couple with a child, who arrive after us, they will be seated first because they have 3 people and we have 2.  We arrive before them, and they seat us both at 4-tops.  There is no excuse for this, and it has happened multiple times.  Proper management would prevent this.
-The staff is so lazy and inattentive at turning over tables.  I've stood there and watched a waitress pick up a single plate, leave everything else, then someone else comes by to collect the forks and not wipe it down. No wonder you have a wait, and empty tables.  That's a combination that points to poor management.
-The server won't guide your food selections.  They are out to get your bill as high as possible to get bigger tips.  I asked for something that was available in a combination, but since I asked for the three items separately and didn't call the menu item by it's specific name they charged me for each individual item and it was an extra $6... for breakfast, which should have been $6 total.  Poor management training of the staff.
-The manager has walked around two of the times we have been in there.  Literally walked around, stopped at tables where her friends were sitting to talk to them for 10 minutes, then walked around again... you might ask how people are doing, you might get some critical feedback that points directly to issues you need to resolve. Or you might get it on yelp, read up. 

It kind of sucks about the awful management and shady staff because the food here is actually pretty good.  Oh well, I can find other pancakes that don't come with the baggage of mismanagement."}
