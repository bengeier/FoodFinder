{"text":"Good food and service but not a lot of healthy options. Typically southern, in that just about everything is thrown until the deep fat fryer.  The green bean side was delicious and their fried flounder was some of the best I've had in a while. My partner said the steak sandwich was a good call.  I've been told their breakfast is wonderful but I've not been there for it yet.  It's clean and friendly and it's a 5 star when only considering restaurants in Monroe.  A few healthier options for the few of us Westerners would be great because clearly the cook here CAN cook and healthy would probably taste good too!"}
{"text":"This place is a delight!  Good country cooking!  Great service Clean Fabulous people  We had the collards, country fried steak, iced tea and THE BEST cornbread"}
{"text":"Great local spot. Food is very good and portions are generous. Wait staff is very friendly."}
{"text":"Great table service but food was just so so. Burger was dry like a frozen patty. Fries were frozen crinkle fries and were just warm not hot. The fried squash was extremely hot and the best thing we ate. (Tip to cook: fry the squash first: it retains the heat better than the fries. Warm squash it ok, cold fries are not). Coffee was weak and only warm. Will not be back. Too many other choices to return to a 2 star."}
