{"text":"This is my review from almost a year ago. I'm going back tomorrow night and will update on the takeout experience!! ----- Even though this restaurant doesn't seem to need another glowing review, this was, as my boyfriend put it, 'the best meal he'd ever had.' I went with him and my mom for an early dinner before the opera. We made reservations just in case, as I had been denied the tasty Thai food on two previous occasions. Even though it was a Wednesday, at least half of the tables had reserved placards on them, so it seemed like we made the right choice.    The hostess sat us and took drink orders, but we didn't see her again for about 15 minutes when she came back to confirm our order of Jasmine tea.  We had water so it wasn't a huge deal.  Our waiter came to take our order and suggested the red curry, the pad thai and st10, a peanutty stir fry.  We also got an order of coconut rice.  The food came out really quickly and was absolutely delicious.  I felt like I needed to upgrade the taste receptors in my mouth to fully experience the flavours in the food because there was so much of it my brain couldn't handle the deliciousness.    We ended up taking leftovers with us (plus an extra order of coconut rice) and I'm happy to say the food was just as delicious this morning as it was last night!"}
{"text":"So we pull up to this sketch looking hotel. There are signs saying \"authntic\" thai cuisine\". No I didn't mispell it...they forgot the \"e\". I thought it was to make it seem more authentic, but the \"half litter\" for  $21 in the drinks menu quelled my doubts. It was packed on a Tuesday night and the portion sizes looked like it was meant for a small army...I always have my doubts with large portion sizes.   I guess I shouldn't have doubted all the awards on the wall, because the fried rice and green curry was some of the best I've had anywhere including Thailand. The pad thai was tasty af but it was missing a little something that I couldn't put my finger on...maybe tamarind...but still a 4/5 as a stand alone. My friends had the dynamite prawn dish and I had to take the plate away because they started lapping head first like Gideons soldiers. All in all this place won't disappoint for a date, night out w friends or take out."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. Despite its location, and no reservations, and now cash only, it is by far the best food I've eaten from any restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, I mean love, so this place is like heaven on earth for me. I've heard great things about White Elephant, so I had to try it and it is by far the best Thai food I've ever tried!   It truly is a hidden gem, tucked away inside a sketchy little hotel called the Airport Travellers Inn. The restaurant is pretty small and cozy, with not too many tables. I came around 5:30 and the place was completely full by 6:00. I got the green curry with chicken and my dad got the yellow curry with chicken. Then we shared a large coconut rice. The portions are huge. We easily could have shared a curry because we were both super stuffed by the end of the meal. The curries though were so delicious and fresh. It tasted so amazing with the sweet coconut rice. You can choose the spiciness of your meal with 1 being the least spicy and 4 being the most. I decided to go with 2, because although I love spicy, our server warned us that this was authentic Thai food and 4 would be too much for us to handle. He was right because 2 was just perfect! The prices are super reasonable, it was 40 bucks altogether and it was a ton of food.   The only downsides of this place is that they only take cash (which isn't so bad as there is an ATM just down the hall) and that they are only open from 5-8 pm! Otherwise, this place is amazing and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"So, today, was dinner time, rainy day.. Stomach was empty, Asian food were craved again. Decided to discover White Elephant based on raving reviews, and skipped my usual to go place.  Line was long, ok, typical rush hours...  Atmosphere was loud, mmm, no problem, I'm cool with with hipsters.  Ordered for take-out was, well, pad thai and chicken satey kebab... My rocket science level of complexity order and 10 digit phone number took dude cash register 5 minute to get it right.. (why asked for my phone number, which took him up to the 3rd attempt before succeeding, for a take out order ?? still a mystery to me) Receipt was printed, $32 was the total. $40 were given, dude took the bills, glanced to the lady behind me, said: \"Next..\"  Confused me asked why no changes back? Dude gave me the looks that presumably reserved for homeless-hobos downtown, then smirked \"You want changes back ? How much ?\" Planned to take back only $2 before \"the look\", now, asked $6 back for changes.  Didn't think the attitude worth jack, but hey, take out boxes and packing at least deserved $2 Again, another dirty look... \"You are done, get out get out!! Next...\"   Annoyed me had already stayed out of the line, turned back, and reached for the candy on their \"pls calm down\" freebie dish. Crazy TNA tubby chick from behind cursed at me \"Hey what's the hold up? If u finish, get the f@#$ out of the way!!\" Kitchen staffs in the front and waiters actually looked at me and giggled ?? Da f@#$? I thought I already left downtown NYC few days ago ???  Waited another 20min, Grouchy and hungry me did some reading on Yelps and Zomato about the place. I wasn't the only one got s@#$@# from the staffs... A moment of kindred spirit to other victims was felt... No prisoners were taken, since their b@#$@#!@ spared none, Asians, Whites, Blacks...etc  Food arrived, le me left like a rabbit escaped the medieval meat market cage Rain was pouring, nose was sniffling... Home was reached, wet clothes were discarded...  Redemption for the whole ordeal was a lukewarm taste of mediocrity and pretentious food decorating attempt to justify the jacked up price. Wasn't impressed with the hype reviews, presumably coming from the horde of poor trusting and starving hotel travelers around the place with little available choices...     Food: -1 Star (what do u know, half way through the chicken and the pad thai, I saw a long ass hair was having a 3way with another noodle string and piece of onion. Upon discovering another funny looking slimy puddle in the other corner of the plastic box, my stomach just turned. Whole thing into the bin seconds after) Services: -1 Star (well, it's not like they robbed me or spiked my food with poison or anything) Repeat: Lol, what ? R u kidding ?? Did u even read the above ???                But hey, if u are a fan of petty revenge spit-festered food and and equal level of serving, by all means..."}
{"text":"The food quality here has changed a lot. Used to be good, now it very average.. Ordered Tom yum soup, papaya salad, red curry with chicken, and coconut rice. The soup tasted good and probably the best thing we had today. The papaya salad had hair in it, red curry tasted like milk and coconut rice was stale. Our food was served in Tupperware..."}
{"text":"Small joint. food is amazing!!!! You have to call ahead to order, otherwise you will end up waiting for a while. Nonetheless food is worth the wait. Will definitely go back there when I'm craving authentic Thai food.   Go early."}
{"text":"This food almost beats going to the mountains; it beats playing with cute little kittens; it beats smelling fresh lilacs or having a massage. It's just above and beyond yummy. Calgary's nectar of the gods. It's so delicious, you'll forget about Thai being expensive and small-portioned. You'll just be grateful for the digestive system and invention of cooked food. The only downsides are its early closing-time and how loud the space gets with more than a couple people in it."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!  It's almost surreal walking down the very dated motel hallway and through the beaded entrance into a less than impressive restaurant.  However, the food is surprisingly good!  I went for lunch and ordered the green curry chicken lunch special, which came with a tom yum soup. Both were delicious, one of the better Thai meals I've had here in Calgary for a fraction of the cost of some other over-priced restaurants.  There were eight of us, and everyone raved about their meals as well.   The lunch specials were all $11, and I had mine with coconut rice which I think was an extra $1.  Will go back to try out some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Now that they no longer accept reservations, we waited 90 minutes to just get seated. They have removed the 4 tables that used to be in the front area ( I guess so that people have a place to wait in line?). Not impressed with the much smaller menu and the much higher prices. The food is pretty good but no longer worth the wait for a table nor the slow service."}
{"text":"Be sure to bring Cash! There is a ATM machine in the hotel lobby.  Ordered the Pad-Se Ew with Prawns, Pineapple Red Curry with Chicken, Coconut Rice and Thai Iced Tea.   It was a delicious meal for 2 with some leftovers. I've been here before and enjoyed the Pad-Se Ew over their Pad Thai noodles. Prawns were a good size and portion size was decent in comparison to other Thai restaurants. Red curry was delicious, ample amounts of ingredients, large pieces of chicken and not overloaded with vegetables in the dish which to me shows that they value quality over cost efficiency. Coconut rice is delicious and great balance to the spices in the curry. Enjoy your meal with a Thai Iced Tea and you'll leave the White Elephant Diner full and happy!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from a colleague when chatting about Thai food. The recommendation was a good one. I have never been to Thailand so I cannot comment on the authenticity of the food, but what we had was great. The first bit of advice is don't go without a reso! It is a little hole in the wall in the Pointe Inn and it is busy. The second piece of advice is despite it all sounding good don't order too many dishes!  My wife and I ordered 3 dishes and rice and were embarrassed by how much food we had on the table. The portions are huge and we likely could have fed 4-6 people. But we were more than happy to have the leftovers. Finally the food.  It was excellent.  Just the right amount of spice (don't like it raging hot), fresh ingredients and exploding with flavour.  The food came out hot and quickly despite a full house and a steady stream of pick up orders. All I could say was thanks to my colleague for the hot tip. We will be back again. And again. Cheers!"}
{"text":"When you hear White Elephant Thai Cuisine automatically the first thing that comes to mind are spicy, elegant, and Thai food. White Elephant is a hidden gem located in the Airport Traveller's Inn (19 St NE & 16 Ave NE), there are two entrances: cutting through the lobby of the Inn and a side door in the middle of a wall.   What I found different of White Elephant is that their maximum capacity is 60 people meaning their dining area is pretty small, they only accept debit and cash, and their hours of operation is from 5pm to 8:30 pm Monday to Saturday. If you are going to dine in White Elephant I strongly recommend going when they open or booking reservations for seating.   I really love the food. I ordered the Orange Chicken stir fry with a side of rice while my girlfriend ordered the Pad Thai. The server will ask you how spicy do you want it and you get to choose between 1 and 4 peppers. A little word of advice, if you're not ordering from the Noodle, Fried Rice, and Appetizers section I do recommend you getting a small order of rice. And yes the small order of rice does balance out with what you order.   Everything about the restaurant is great except the wait time if you decide to walk in but other than that it would be a great experience to try! I strongly recommend White Elephant and would definitely come back"}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food. A favorite for lunch.  Tip: order take out because it takes way tooo long to get served for lunch. Make reservations! Call right before they open and make one, otherwise you will not get seated or refused at the door. That busy and that good!  The food is delicious. As authentic as Thai food can get. I was in Thailand earlier this year and the Paenang Curry and Matsaman Curry took me right back to the beaches and scuba diving lunches. Delicious and good value.   The soup had real kaffir lime leaves in it. It doesn't get anymore authentic than that."}
{"text":"My first time here this evening. The best Tom Yum Koong and the smoothest green curry I've ever had in my life! Will be back."}
{"text":"Calgary's best Thai Restaurant!  Where? Located in the Airport Traveller's Inn (Really? Yes, it looks sketchy but really. Step inside and walk down the hallway and the restaurant is on your left)  What should I order? Red curry, Orange curry, yellow curry, green curry, Veggie spring rolls, pad thai with shrimp, iced coffee... whatever your heart desires!  Why? Because the food is freaking amazing!  How can I pay? CASH ONLY! (The owners will always remind you when you come in)"}
{"text":"Best Thai in Calgary. Worth the Wait. Hidden Gem for sure! Authentically source ingredients and taste! Must try!"}
{"text":"All dishes were great, with the largest proportions I've seen anywhere (seriously) for all three non-noodle dishes.  Tom Yum soup (largest of three sizes) had 15+ large prawns in it, and TONS of other veg etc...  Great.  Papaya salad was also very large and fresh with great spice, dried shrimps etc... Also great.  Pad See Ew was very good.  I asked for \"nam pla\" (spicy fish sauce) for a topping and it came as a very nice home blend... Very good.  Curry was \"ok\".  I usually find N.A. curries to be \"rushed cooked\" (all ingredients thrown in and cooked at once), with more of a milky look/taste and this was certainly the case... Its a rare find to get a curry that has had its spice \"cooked\", with proper oil separation... Also a little on the sweet side that can come from too much pineapple/liquid.  Still very tasty...  Was going to give 4 of 5 stars as slow to take order and bring check, though with this quality of Thai for the price in Calgary, 5 it is.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We've been several times, and the food is consistently excellent, at a reasonable price.  The owner is a former Thai Airways pilot, and flies both herbs and seafood in from his farm in Phuket several times a week. The panang and massaman curries (my favorites) are consequently full of wonderful, fresh flavours.The pilot's wife makes everything from scratch, including the coconut ice cream.  If you have a hankering for Thai food in Calgary, look no further."}
{"text":"I love white elephant! Wish it was closer downtown!!! The service is always friendly and the good is just amazing. They don't like to sit large groups during peak hours so don't be surprised if they turn you away. Since it is a small kitchen I think they don't want to be overwhelmed. Takeout is a great option if you can make the trek!"}
{"text":"We ordered Tom Yum soup,  green curry with coconut rice, papaya salad, and pad Thai. The green curry is the best of curry I ever had. The flavour is dynamic yet well balanced. Pad Thai didn't impress me much. It could be better.  Overall, very satisfied and will definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Friends of ours raved about this place, but we were left unimpressed. We got there right when they opened and they had difficulty accommodating our party of 8. The staff aren't the friendliest and service isn't quick.   The food was OK, but not stellar. We tried a total of 7 different dishes and the rice was our favorite, which doesn't say much...    The decor is old, out-dated and tired. The chairs aren't overly comfortable and once you get a few families in there with screaming kids, the places loses its charm.  We left disappointed and I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"Great service , delicious food , soo much food u get enough to take left over home :) ordered chicken satay it was so soft juicy and declines ... Tom yum soup has all the sweet tangy sour and spicy .... High light Padthai :) soo good ! And last dish was this crispy fish with curry sauce :) soo good it's like fish and chip vibes but with Thai flavour ! Superb ! Solid dinner date !"}
{"text":"If we are talking about only the food, this is definitely 5 stars for me.  They lose one star just given the difficulty of securing a spot. As you will read from other reviews, definitely, definitely make a reservation as the wait is loonggg. The only problem is trying to figure out how to make one. They don't seem to answer their phone or check messages, so I'm not really sure how else to make a reservation? We were making jokes that it would be worthwhile to make a standing monthly reservation and then auction it off if you can't make it...The place is busy so service is on the slow side. I believe it's one family that is doing everything from serving, bussing, and cooking, so I feel for them and was patient. They certainly did the best they could and you can see them running.  The food is well worth the wait however. I don't remember exactly what we had as it was a while ago and we got a crapton of dishes. Standout was definitely the butterfly shrimp (or a name like that), curries, and the coconut rice. Pad thai was above average, but I've had better. The server recommended spice levels for us, but I think he may have toned it down given that there were non-asians in the group...unfortunately, we were all fans of spicy so it would have been nice to have it spicier.  And as others have mentioned, don't be put off by the very sketchy motel that it's located in. Also, probably not a great place for a first date: sketchy motel + long wait + crazy busy & loud. Or maybe you're like me and it's the perfect place for a first date to weed out the undesirables, haha."}
{"text":"This was a little hole in the wall inside a hotel- so I had my doubts. Well it was great. Three of us split a beef curry and orange chicken and shrimp meal with coconut rice. It was medium heat and was fantastic. Remember cash or debit card only."}
{"text":"Travelled from far NW to eat at White Elephant in N.E. as we saw good reviews on Yelp and wanted to Thai-one-on.   Had a difficult time finding it because of a lack of signage on one side of the building, we passed right by it. Turns out it is located inside an Airport Inn, which doesn't provide them much space for signage.  We walked down the long hallway famished and ready to eat.  The hostess greeted us with an announcement that they accept only cash.  Terrible time trying to find the place and then they accept only cash.  We went to another restaurant, angry that we had wasted our time on the White Elephant."}
{"text":"Finally - a Thai restaurant in Calgary worth returning to. We'd tried Chili Club (expensive) and Juree's (not that good) and were left wondering if the city had decently-priced and tasty Thai.   On a tip from a fellow Yelper, we trekked to White Elephant. Located down a dark internal hallway in a kinda-seedy hotel, this cash-only establishment clearly has a cult following since all the tables were occupied about 20 minutes after opening and people were waiting in that hallway when we left.   Food was quite good: fried tofu was prepared well, beef phad Thai was acceptable, and yellow chicken curry had good heat and the sauce was tasty with well-developed flavours. Wish this place was closer but we'll certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is probably the best Thai restaurant I've been to in Calgary. There are people who may prefer a better location but I kind of like the atmosphere of the joint because it reminds me of the same decor you might see IN Thailand (I've been there so I'm not just making shit up!). The food tasted great - my group had a whole bunch of different things but I truly recommend starting with the Som Tam (a salad). My only miniscule complaint is that when i was asked how spicy I would like my green curry on a scale from 1 to 4, I said 3 and it wasn't really spicy at all. I've had the spiciest Thai food I can possibly imagine and this was far from it. Maybe they think people like me can't handle 3 out of 4 but I certainly can.  Saying that, I think most people will find that spice sufficient. I also think that if I bothered the waiter about how lame I thought the spice was last time I would probably get more than I bargained for! And another side thought - whoever came up with the stupid idea of breathing fire after taking a bite of the spicy chicken sandwich from a popular fast food chain should be forced to eat only the spiciest Thai food until they realize the fallacy of their ways. Why is exagerration becoming commonplace? OK now the best feature of the restaurant is two-fold: The great tasting food and the quantity! They give you tonnes of food in Thailand too because for some reason the beautiful skinny people there eat a LOT (source: my sister in law is Thai). I'm looking forward to eating here again!!!"}
{"text":"The dining experience at White Elephant overall was great.   We enjoyed the food -- each of them came in large portion. The curry and Pad Thai were fairly good (Well, not as good as the authentic ones I had in Toronto);  The server was nice but did not speak fluent English...We had to repeat our orders many times.  The place is crowded...we had our reservation at 8pm but had to postpone it to 8:30 because there were no available seats...  I will definitely go back...but will probably order take-outs instead."}
{"text":"OMG.....When we first got here I thought what are we getting into. This is a weird location. It's half way down the main floor hallway of the best western off of 16 ave NE and 19th Street.  We waited about 40 minutes to get our food after we ordered, but is was well worth the wait. The food was flavorful and as good or better than many places we have visited in Thailand, and hands down better than any other Thai Place in Calgary. We were able to tell them how spicy we wanted our food. I swore after seeing the location and the interior that no matter how good the food was I would only give this place a 3 star rating, but really the food is this good. Plus the price is cheaper than any other Thai food in town. I hear they ave a lunch special for $9. I can't wait to try it out.  The bill was reasonable at $54 for 4 great Thai dishes and a couple of pepsi's. This place is the real deal and worth a visit.   BTW   believe it or not you'll need a reservation on the weekends or you may not get in."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place for Thai food.   There is nothing left from the old place. Dishes came lukewarm. Rice wasn't fresh. It was reheat at best. Few choices on the menu. Service is non existent (at least they had good food before). We were very disappointed with our visit. Won't be back again. AVOID. there are some other good options in Calgary now. It's not like a couple of years ago."}
{"text":"Some of the best food I've ever had and really friendly service. A little hard to find (go into the pointe inn entrance) but amazing."}
{"text":"This is a very good Thai restaurant suggest you give it a visit. The food was tasty and prepared well."}
{"text":"Really awesome food specially the green curry shrimp !! The quantity was huge. We did a take out order and were told to pick it in 1 hour, the place sure is super busy"}
{"text":"Pros: - Lots of food! - Tasty! - Cheap! - Vegan-able! (I am not super picky on shared surfaces)  Cons: - Rice itself a lil' pricey - Some sort of tough rooty thing in the curry. Was very flavorful but not very edible, maybe I wasn't suppose to try to eat it ;P.  Friend and I had the pad thai w/o eggs, the green curry with eggplant and coconut rice. Came to $28. Had leftovers for myself for 2 more (smallish) meals!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for Thai food in probably all of the city.  I already knew how slow the service is, and that they are perennially understaffed.  However, I would keep coming back because of the good food.  My experience at lunch hour though is definitely going to make me think twice about  going back.  I made a reservation at 11 AM for a table for 3 for 12 NN.  We came in at around 12, and the host said that my name was not on his list.  After checking in the kitchen, he confirmed with somebody (presumably his wife/chef) that I did make the phone call.  We were seated, but not before being reminded that it'd take 30 to 45 minutes for the food to arrive.  Sure, whatever, I knew that all along.  20 minutes later, I overheard the husband and wife yelling at each other at the kitchen.  Minutes later, the host came out, calling everyone's attention.   He said that everyone who hasn't been served food (my party, another party of around 8 people sitting close to us, and probably at least 4 other parties), was being asked to leave.  The chef couldn't take the pressure anymore, and couldn't continue cooking.  It was so surreal, I didn't even know how to react."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this but The White Elephant is not what it used to be.  The food used to be spectacular. The service was good too. Not any more.  Firstly, you have to get there early and stand in line. My husband and I were there first for dinner. The workers saw us there and acknowledged that we were first in line and so, the first to be served. That didn't go so well the last and final time we went there.  We were seated first, but that was it! Two other tables of (assumably) friends of the owners were seated next and served first and second. Hubby complained to the manager and he assured my husband that he would make sure that the waiter served us first and that he was sorry for the mix up. After returning to our table, hubby and I waited and watched, fuming, while the waiter again returned to the two other tables.  By this time, I had had enough. We left and never went back.  That is a shame, because the food was very good with the previous owners.."}
{"text":"Poor service, just kept on waiting. They rather arrange forks than take order from us, wanna Togo box? Go to the front desk, wanna pay your bill? Go to front desk... Food is normal, nothing special. And I was extremely thirsty afterwards... maybe too much MSG?"}
{"text":"Easily the best Thai food I've enjoyed short of actually visiting Thailand. The portions are large and absolutely delicious! Drawbacks are: they only do cash, only open for a few hours, and have room for only about 20 people. With the exemplary food they serve, though, demand is still quite high; where people are waiting at the door, before they open,  sometimes 15-20 minutes. Don't let that deter you though! This place is a hidden gem and your hard pressed to find better Thai food in this city."}
{"text":"Food was amazing and fresh. Order it medium spicy but it came spicy which was ok for us. Main complaint is that the service was poor, very rushed and food took over a hour. Great Thai but just not worth the wait for us!   Go early for a table and they don't take credit cards!"}
{"text":"Ok food. Terrible service.  The food is not any better than you'd find at other Thai places, and in my opinion a bit worse.  Terrible service.  Saw the server once after we'd been sitting for almost an hour. Gave our order and the food came about 45 min later. Will never go here again, and would never recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"My son was in town visiting and we wanted to go for Thai food. Being new to Calgary from Vancouver, I didn't know what to suggest. I Yelped it & this place came up so off we went. When we got to the parking lot, we literally almost turned around to go somewhere else as it's in an old Airport Travellers Inn with poor signage. Hmmm... Would've been a HUGE mistake! This place is sooooo delicious!! The portions are big and everything we ordered was fab. Green curry, Pad Thai, a peanut sauce stir fry. All excellent. I've been back 3X since then (& we've only been here 3 months). Their Fish in Chili Sauce is also a must. The place is always filled with Thai folks too, so you know it's good. I absolutly love Thai food & thought we'd be outta luck finding anything here as good as in Vancouver... man, was I wrong. White Elephant is definitely a Ma n' Pa type place & not huge, so there are lineups often when they open each night, but well worth the wait! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Shrimp Tom Yum soup is very authentic. The Green and Red Curry variations of pork, beef and chicken are very unique in taste. One must be willing to wait  for their food to arrive because the place is always packed for dinner. Also, one must be assertive in asking for water or for your order because all waiters are busy attending to all tables. The long wait is always compensated by the friendly owner / chef who would usually give discount to frequent eaters. I would always recommend this Thai resto to any  visitors and local peeps around town. Price is reasonable for every plate."}
{"text":"I was feeling a lazy night coming on last weekend so I decided to order some take out. I've heard awesome things about this place and I live about a block away so I thought I'd check it out.   I looked up their menu on their website which is extremely useful for someone that hasn't been there and doesn't want to wait for food. (I said lazy night, didn't mention anything about patience). I call and placed the order and was told 25 minutes and it was ready when I got there. Always a plus.   The Pad Thai I got was fantastic! I asked for very spicy and was it ever. Very few places make food to my spice tolerance level so I'm always happy when somewhere actually does it. I also got some Thai spring rolls which where still hot and steamy with a good crunch to them.   I would definitely recommend this place and can't wait to go there with a few friends."}
{"text":"Tucked away in the Pointe Inn (a bit sketchy), this place offers the best Thai food I've had in Calgary. I'd say that other diners would agree because without reservations this place is near to impossible to get into. Just a note that they are not too pleased if you show up without reservations (we did and since we were early enough, they let us sit down but was informed we had to be out by 5:30)  Quickly we put our order in: chicken pad thai and green curry with thai egg plant with a side of rice. The aroma of the food cooking was making me super hungry and I couldn't wait to try it!  The chicken pad thai had quite a kick to it but delicious nonetheless. The green curry?A-MAZING! The melody of veggies complimented the spices and creamy coconut milk, and even though I was stuffed I couldn't stop eating it!  I'd love to try this place again, but it might just be for take-out. The service isn't great (and I've heard of other people's bad experiences with staff) and it's quite difficult to make a reservation - their website currently notes you can't phone or email reservations."}
{"text":"This was a difficult one to review. But, gotta be honest, right? Not good...  I started writing reviews because I wanted to \"give back\" for some of the great little gems I found through this site. As such, I found this place as a result of the glowing reviews here on Yelp and elsewhere.  My girlfriend and I have been to Thailand 4 times in the past 5 years. We have eaten at the best of the best 5 star restaurants, and we have eaten at cooked food stalls in the streets and alleys of Chiang Mai and Sukhumvit. I'd like to think I know authentic Thai food.  First off, we ordered take-out, and it's a good thing we did because the place is a complete gong show. A huge crowd of people waiting in the door, some with reservations, some being turned away, some trying to pay, others picking up orders. I have never seen anything like it.   We ordered a curry dish, pad thai, a vegetable dish, and rice. They were out of glass noodle salad (Yum Woon Sen) and Larb, although it was only 6pm on Saturday and they open at 5. Yum Woon Sen is usually our go-to acid test dish when trying a new Thai place. Too bad.  Of our choices, the curry was just ok, the Pad Thai unlike anything I have ever seen in Thailand (Authentic? I think not!) and very uninspired, and the vegetable stir fry was downright bland, a word rarely associated with Thai food.   Spice-wise, we always ask for very spicy, and it wasn't even medium. Typically, we find Thai restaurants afraid to really \"spice it up\" for us westerners, but there is a secret: Know the phrase for \"very spicy\" in Thai: Phet-Man... it usually works, but at White Elephant it did not.   All I can say is, there are far better choices for delicious Thai food in Calgary, and the popular opinion on this place really has me shaking my head, as it's rare that I so blatantly disagree with a restaurant's rating.   P.S. My personal favourite Thai place is ...see next reviewI :) ."}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food! My only regret is not having heard about them earlier. Try the red curry, it's has little piece of mandarins in it. So zesty"}
{"text":"White Elephant has been around for a very long time. In Calgary it is one of the best thai food place I have been. It is located inside the motel. Instead of going into the main lobby of the motel you now can enter from the side. It is small but surprisingly it can fit quite a bit of people. For party greater than 6 people it maybe challenging.   Must get are the green curry, coconut rice, and the fish filet (i love the garlic). Their pad Thai is good, but I wouldn't say the best.   The portion are family style (except rice), the green curry would allow 3 people to be comfortably full and it is a date, one of you will have to take the left over home."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Southern California, everywhere I go I try new Thai restaurants. Let me start by saying that had it not been for the Yelp reviews, I wouldn't have stepped foot into this hotel, what a dive!! Even walking through the lobby grossed me out, some kind of smell I cant describe, not from the restaurant either. That being said, once I walked down the hall and entered the restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised, clean and busy as ever. I was fortunate to get a table. Many people were waiting in the hall after I was seated as well. So, for the food I do give it 5 stars, but for service 1-2 because I waited 20 minutes before my order was taken and then another 45 minutes to get my meal. Flavor was absolutely wonderful. My only minor complaint would be the eggplant was a bit over cooked but thats it. I highly recommend it if you don't mind walking through hell to get there."}
{"text":"Excellent food and good sized portions. Go early as it packs out and it is a small place."}
{"text":"A bit annoying that they are so busy and don't do reservations.  Curry was really good.  Pad thai was average.  Papaya salad was slightly below average.  Overall, the place was pretty good but I wouldn't rave about it like a lot of the other reviewers."}
{"text":"Really, as good as it gets! Went there for dinner with a group of friends and every single dish the owner recommended was delicious.   This place is a hidden gem in the hotel is located in... Point Inn I think? you would never think   an amazing restaurant would be somewhere in there...  My new fave Thai restaurant in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Because of the reviews we were very excited to be here. When we arrived there were 4 people at one table waiting for their order. We were completely ignored. We had to wave down a waitress to get seated, and then it was at least 10 minutes later when a waiter rushed passed us and we grabbed him. Their menu is a lot of meat dishes and a lot of fried foods... not too many healthy options. We said we were vegan and didn't want fish sauce or meat. We asked about the spring rolls. He said they were veggie only. We asked for a slightly custom stir fry veggie dish and rice. It was another 15 minutes at least before we got the rolls. They were very greasy but we were so hungry we wolfed them down. They had very little filling inside- mostly bean sprouts. The filling inside was kind of oily and bland. There was a vinegar sauce for dipping the rolls that was overly sweet. The stir fry was bland. I asked for chili sauce to enliven it and the waiter brought a tiny, tiny bowl of it. Really? C'mon! We had asked that the tofu would be fried for our stir fry (we like it dry) but it was super soft. There were a ton of onions in it- it was mostly onion! There were two pieces of cauliflower, a bit of broccoli (that we had asked for), some strange mushrooms that tasted and looked like canned mushrooms, and a tiny bit of carrot. There was a sweet taste to the stir fry, and we think a stir fry shouldn't be sweet! They didn't offer brown rice- only coconut or white. The whole meal was bland and felt cheaply made. Not great service, pretty expensive for what we got, and not great food. I don't understand why this has been written up as a good place. Also, both the men's and women's bathrooms were out of paper towels. They had just opened so it's not like they had been busy all night and didn't have time to stock it. Sad."}
{"text":"Visiting Calgary I stumbled on this hole in the wall.   What a treat.   Fantastic food.   Red curry is to die for.   And the soups.  Wow.    I'll make sure to revisit it every future Calgary trip."}
{"text":"It was a busy night and 4 of us without reservations. Told us it could be up to 40 min to get food (nice to be warned). But we ordered appys first and had them in 10 min. Main dishes were also arriving 10 min after we ordered them.  Pad Thai with chicken, fish with chillies (super hot), green curry/chicken/eggplant and matusan curry. All were well prepped and tasty. The matusan was mild and sweetish with strong hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. Perfect for our friend that likes milder curries.  The green curry was rich and aromatic. Our curry cravings were well satisfied. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorites... solid Thai food with so much flavor, good portions and great value! Service could be better but the food is worth it!"}
{"text":"I must be REALLY picky, because after reading the glowing reviews I thought this place would've been a lot better. It's true that its located in a seedy hotel in the N.E. just off 16th ave. adjacent to Vista Heights. It's true the decor isn't great. It's true the food isn't bad, but let me elaborate.  I ordered the Pineapple fried rice, and the rice was a little soggy the beef a little chewy. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be like Chinese fried rice,  they use day old rice. The spring rolls were tasty, about three quarters of the size of Vietnamese ones. The spring rolls which came 4 to an order were crispy, hot and fresh. The yellow curry pork was really tasty as well. It came with a good amount of pork, potatoes, etc. The curry was also good to eat with coconut rice as well.  On to the restaurant itself. It's small, they only take cash, its in a dumpy motel, the setting is more cafeteria like. The chairs aren't really great, and the table cloths are vinyl. I found the table cloths sticky.  In conclusion, if you want okay Thai food then try this place out. If you are picky of your surroundings, then stay away. Otherwise try it once, just so you can say you've been there.  If you do want Thai food in a nicer setting, I would recommend The King and I.   It feels much cleaner inside."}
{"text":"In the case that this is the first you have heard they only accept cash or debit, so be prepared. I had a craving for Tom Kai soup... I was checking out reviews and menus and decided to make the trip to White Elephant Thai Cuisine. It is just as I expected in regards to what I had heard - a little hidden place in an old hotel - not fancy.. It was busy, a bit loud and almost full at 5:30 PM on a Tuesday. My daughter ordered chicken Pad Thai and I of course had the Tom Kai soup. We also ordered a large coconut rice. The service was a bit slow, but not neglectful, they were understandably busy. They delivered on THE BEST Thai meal ever!!! So that counts for a lot. My daughters Pad Thai was flavour perfection and HUGE. The coconut rice was delicious! We will have generous leftovers for 2 or three meals tomorrow! The Tom Kai soup was heaven in a bowl - the best ever. I ordered a large and finished it, but it was work. There is no way I could have left it. It was too delicious to waste any. I will be returning to White Elephant soon. Be sure to save a big appetite and go at an off peak time if you go. I am so grateful this place exists! They've have left me in a delightful dreamy eyed haze... Still savouring, long after... I have forgotten all other restaurants in Calgary. At least for awhile..."}
{"text":"Ekhmm.. I decided to give a try this restaurant (I was there in September this year) and drove through whole city to get there even while reading all these 5star reviews, I had a feeling, that probably all people who write them are mostly the guests of the hotel where the restaurant is situated..  I'm gonna say that unfortunately I might had right, because this place absolutely didn't make a good impression on me!!!  Ok, there were only three things that I liked (that's why I'm giving one star):  - we didn't have a reservation but they find free spot for us (only for an hour, but still that was nice) - design  - smile on almost every staff face!! But that's all!!! and it's not enough to call this place \"great\" or even good!!   Let's list all drawbacks: - staff is extremely slow (we were waiting to place our order around 15 long min., then more than 20 for our two dishes - and we had only an hour for all including eating because we didn't have a reservation) - food (we ordered Fried Chicken and Cashew nuts and Sweat and Sour with beef).. maybe I've never been to Thailand before and maybe I don't have too many thai friends (only a couple) but I've thought that as a big fan of thai food and guest of many thai restaurant in Asia, Europe and US, I know how it should taste.. maybe I was wrong because this one was.. just without any taste!!! I asked for extra spicy dish (a little more than Thai spicy), and.. it wasn't even \"medium\" for me!! Fat and not hot enough - I didn't ask to warm it up and ad more spices, because I was really hungry and I didn't have a time for it!! I was feeling this food in my stomach for another two days!! Blahh!! - layout is little awkward and there in not enough room to seat comfortably, at least in the front (I'm really not that big and I still could look into the neighbors plates without any efforts and even almost touch their knees) - it's expensive (we ate in many cheaper places which are definitely better)  Overall, please think twice if you consider to go that place!!! If you aren't this hotel guest and/or you don't have any better choices to go for a dinner - I definitely don't recommend this restaurant!! We were really disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall places always end up being the best. I went here last night with a party of four. The food was the best Thai food any of us had ever had. We ordered the panang curry, green curry, pineapple fried rice, and chicken satay. The portions are huge and there was more than enough food for the four of us. A member of our party was on a very restrictive diet and the staff was quite accommodating to her needs. Overall a fantastic place."}
{"text":"White Elephant is a place you won't forget.  The tell-tale story starts off right as you walk into the motel (you heard right) and meander through to find the opening of this unassuming restaurant. Don't let the dingy motel, haphazardly arranged tables and chairs, and atypical western service throw you off.   This place serves damn good thai food. You can't go wrong with any of their entrees. Be sure to order a thai ice tea to cap off your unusual, yet palette satisfying dining experience.  You will be talking about this place for days after.  Word to the wise: please be curt, as many of us will be waiting patiently in line to have our White Elephant experience too."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Calgary. No competition. But there's also no reservations, so show up early!"}
{"text":"Food is not bad but I would prefer Juree because of the taste. White Elephant has probably altered the taste for the local tastebuds. Some of the dishes in the menu were not available. The place is small and stuffy. Green Curry Tofu is my favorite of all!"}
{"text":"Not the nicest place, if you are not familiar of the area it is quite hard to find. service was ok, we waited a long time to get a glass of wine and had to ask for it 3 times before we got it. As soon as we walked in, we found an older lady with a baby on a corner and a table full of diapers and baby stuff, I'm sure its probably the owner's family or something. its definitely a turn off for someone coming for their first time.   On the positive note,  i would have to admit that it is one of the best thai food i have ever had. I ordered the red curry and pad thai, and they were amazing! I will definitely come back if ever i am craving thai food.   If you want to experience real authentic food, sometimes you have to overlook all the negatives and try not to judge the book by its cover. This is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I'd love to write a review about the food but unfortunately I was not served. I had only my credit card and US$ cash. Only Canadian debit cards and Ca$ cash are accepted. Guys, you are next to the airport and the INTERNATIONAL travel lounge. The place looked also messy, a big food cart with dirty dishes was next to the entrance. The menu card was sticky. But seeing all the good reviews here, the food must make up for it..."}
{"text":"Taste and feel like what you can find in Thailand.  As a Thai people who lives in Thailand for my whole life, I found this restaurant taste very authentic. I came here with my family. We ordered Tom Yam Kai, stir fry vegetables, sweet and sour fish, papaya salad, and stir fry basil pork. Everything taste like great and authentic for Thai people like me and my family."}
{"text":"We ordered Green Chicken Curry and Shrimp Padthai. The curry was the best I've ever tried so far."}
{"text":"OMG OMG OMG - DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER!  This tiny little place is located inside a very shady looking hotel! Haha However, it's sooooo amazingly delicious! I plan on going back next time I am in Calgary, even if it means going out is my way. Their food compares to many authentic Thai places I've tried in NYC.   Their Thai Iced tea is to die for. Not the healthiest because it's loaded with sugar, however, if you feel like being bad - order this!!! Soooooo yummy!!!!   For appetizers - I enjoyed their Thai chicken satay and their spring rolls!   I tried their stir fries and their chicken curry. Both OMG good! I also love that you can order white rice on the side to eat with your meals as you wish.   The price was great for the value of food you are getting! You will NOT regret it.   The staff is amazing and there is free parking!"}
{"text":"Delicious!  We went out of our way to have lunch there one day, after reading all these amazing reviews. Thanks to Julia's tip, I walked straight into the hotel and found the restaurant immediately. The place was full when we arrived, and they said \"sorry\". We were adamant, so just waited in the hotel lobby till a table opened up, and we jumped on it.   I ordered the tofu panang curry and my fiance ordered something I cant remember. The tofu panang curry was out. of. this. WORLD. The tofu was firm and meaty, and the sauce was delicious and coconut-y. The flavours were strong, yet delicate enough to taste everything. Absolutely amazing. The coconut rice serving was huge, and they even served it with a tiny shrimp tom-yum soup on the side. Everything was so good I literally could not stop eating until the whole thing was done. And then I realized I could barely move anymore.   My fiance thoroughly enjoyed his meal as well.   After I went back home, I surely needed the rest of the afternoon and evening to recover from the food coma I had put myself through. It is a good thing White Elephant is nowhere near my house, or else I'd find myself there all too often and quickly become the FAT elephant."}
{"text":"Best Thai I've had in Calgary for sure, comparable to the best Thai I've ever had. Not that I've had a ton but I have a couple favourites in North America - Spoon & Fork in Toronto and Lotus of Siam in Las Vegas.   Pa Nang Shrimp Curry was great! - broth looked watery at first but had SO much flavour and the Shrimp and veg were fresh and perfectly cooked. Pad See Ew (wide noodles) was average compared to the other dishes, and the \"mountain of chicken\" Tamarind dish was addictively good.    Dessert - Mango and sticky rice. A bit salty but in a potato chip sort of \"I can't stop eating this\" way, and needed more mango. Banana dessert was also great, served with creamy tasty vanilla-toasted coconut ice cream.   Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"At first, finding this place was tricky. They used to be inside the Best Western in Marlborough and Google Maps still lists BW as their location, but they're actually in the Pointe Inn across the street from BW.  I walked inside, and was immediately greeted by the incredibly friendly owners and staff. I'm always apprehensive when going to an unfamiliar restaurant, because finding good vegan options - even in brand-new, supposedly \"innovative\" places in Cowtown can be difficult. Especially when the trends seem to be leaning toward wrapping bacon around everything from hamburgers, to ice cream and even jujubes, then deep-frying in duck fat. Reminds me of that episode of Full House, where Michelle is trying to earn her cooking badge in Scouts, so she makes Tuna Vanilla Ice Cream.  Tangent!  No fear of that here in White Elephant. The vegan options are extensive, with a whole section of the menu dedicated to veg offerings; each one unique and delicious sounding (No stir-fry with plain rice, stir-fry with fried rice and stir-fry with vermicelli here!). There were ten of us here for Maria Elena's birthday, so Shannon asked the owner if he would order for us. This made him ECSTATIC, and he started describing each selection with such heartfelt enthusiasm that I had to resist the urge to tip my head back and commence drooling. He let us know that 3 times a week, he imports fruits and vegetables directly from his family's farm in Thailand, and that they made their own tofu.   White Elephant's dishes are served up family style, so the ten of us shared eight dishes (two of them vegan-friendly), and two appetizers (a veg one and meat one) starting with veggie spring rolls with a sweet chili sauce and chicken satay skewers with peanut sauce. The veggie spring rolls were not your typical thawed out fare; you could taste the skill and freshness and they tasted light, despite being right out of a deep-fryer. I also normally hate sweet plum chili sauce, but White Elephant's version went perfectly with the spring rolls. Everyone else loved the chicken satay and the peanut sauce, too.   The winner of the evening, despite Shannon's dislike for eggplant, turned out to be one of the vegan dishes: Eggplant and their homemade Tofu in a Coconut Curry sauce. I wanted to inject that sauce directly in to my veins. Their Pad Thai with Tofu was also some of the best Pad Thai I have ever had. Everything was served with generous amounts of their coma-inducing Coconut Rice. If all I had been able to eat was that maddeningly tasty, fluffy thigh insulator; I probably still would've been pleased.   For dessert, I had their deep-fried bananas. I don't know how I still had room for them, but they were a cozy end to a scrumtralescent tummy-only trip to Thailand.  If you're not vegan or lactose intolerant, try their Thai Iced Tea."}
{"text":"This is such a hidden gem. It looks like such a hole in the wall place, and it could use a makeover decor wise, but the food is unbeatable. The coconut rice, curry and the dynamite prawns are my favourite! Be warned, if you ask them to make it spicier for you they don't mess around!! Still delicious but I definitely paid for that one the next day."}
{"text":"The food was good but as a minor suggestion for improvement, they shouldn't have offloaded dirty dishes beside our table. They should position the cart closer to the kitchen or at least conceal the cart with the unused wooden gate nearby.   Otherwise, great soup (Tom Ka Kai), and the pad Thai was well done."}
{"text":"This is now my favourite Thai Restaurant in Calgary! Tucked inside The Airport Traveller's Inn, this place is well worth the walk down the sketchy hallway to this little gem. Order the freshly made spring rolls and soup to warm you up out of the cold. Then try the coconut rice with green curry with beef, spicy noodles and if you have a group of 4, the Pad Thai. Every dish you order is made fresh, has a different flavour profile and can you can dial up the spice from 1 to the moon! Oh and the iced Thai tea is sweet and refreshing. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First let me say, \"Do not judge a place by it's outward appearance\". Secondly, it has to be some of the best Thai food I have ever tasted. Believe me, here in Houston where I am from we have great places but this is by far the best in Calgary. In my recent travel, I stayed at a nearby hotel and was told to visit this small establishment. I did and wowzer was I burning up. Let me explain...upon entrance to the small restaurant (which maybe seats 25 people) I sat down and ordered my chicken Thai plate. I asked the waiter to make it spicy. He replied that he would make something just for me. OK, I responded. When my food arrived he had this small porcelain plate with some hot chili sauce. I put some on my food not even thinking and it had a punch greater than Chuck Norris or Master Bruce Lee. I was burning up but after a five minute ordeal I pushed away the chili and enjoyed my meal. I am a fan of this place and have since visited once more. It's definitely a must for any Calgarian  or visitor looking for some amazing Thai food."}
{"text":"I never would of known about this place or stepped inside if not for my fellow Yelpers! Thanks!  Thai food is one of my absolute faves! We made a point to come here and let me tell you - as others may say, you come here for the food and not for the ambiance (lotsa screaming babies) nor the service which was just a pass. The restaurant is clean.  If you need the washroom, back out into the hallway you go and you need to ask for the key. Luckily, I did not need it! DO make a reservation. We did not have one but squeaked through. The wait can be long for your dishes but when they do come they are hot and fresh. I had a Thai iced coffee and it was really good. They were out of stock on some beer so you may not get your choice of domestic brands. Ordered: Shrimp fried wontons to start (REALLY yummy and come with a nice, spicy sauce) Prawn Pad Thai - good, all chopped up into bite sized pieces. I had not seen it served like that before. They had run out of lime so they brought me a lemon. Not so good but not a huge deal. The prawns were a nice size and the dish had a nice bite to it. I was able to order it extra spicy, no egg. Chicken Panang - sooo good! GET THIS! So coconutty rich and the chicken was as soft as butter. Lots of chicken. Peas, carrots were added to the mix. MMMM Coconut rice - good. Not the best I have ever had but good. I like it not so overcooked. The dishes were a really nice portion size, and we both took some of our meals home. Prices were on par with the rest of Calgary Thai joints. The menu is huge! I never thought I would wander through a questionable, sleepy hotel lobby to enter a little outdated restaurant with dazzling food but hey! It was the thing to do and I am glad we went to check it out! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"very good pad thai with very big prawns (if you get the prawn pad thai). Lots of flavour and soft thin strands of noodle. only thing that's missing is a lime wedge! Comes with a very large serving spoon! Very good pork spring rolls...light and crispy shell. Very similar to Vietnamese spring rolls...around $8 for 6 rolls. we had something that resembled honey garlic chicken wings to start and that was also very good. The beef and basil stir fry with coconut rice was nice...coconut rice was waaay better than what I had at Thai Bistro (downtown Calgary). We ordered level 2 spicy (1 being not spicy and 4 being the most) and I think I should've gone for level 3 as it wasnt spicy at all (to me). Beef basil stir fry was not as saucy as I wanted (would've liked it wetter with sauce) but still flavourful. Customer service was very good."}
{"text":"So a buddy of mine is married to a Thai girl and suggested I go here with them. I live in Calgary and have been to Thailand, I loved the food but never really found a good place in Calgary. Apparently he and his wife had the same feeling until they went here. Owned and operated by Thai people, and my understanding is one of them is a airline pilot and so able to bring back fresh Thai ingredients for the food 1-2 times a week. It shows... Delicious, flavorful and not just spicy like many assume Thai is all about. So many flavors and something for everyone.   Few things to mention: ignore the crap hotel its in... it reflects nothing about this place and it is busy despite its surroundings for a reason. You owe it to yourself to step over the hobo (kidding) and venture inside for these flavors.  Thai people do not use chopsticks. Not only is it okay to be a Fork and knife guy its expected.  Get the sticky rice and mango desert. This was one of my very favorite street vendor snacks in Thailand and I had all but resigned to the idea that I would never have it in Canada... not the same anyway. So very happy to find out I was wrong.   Delicous, friendly and delicious."}
{"text":"The good... The food is awesome and very authentic! Tons of flavour, well seasoned, plenty of portions to share with a group. I really liked the Panang Curry with Beef and the Basil Chicken!  The value is much better than places downtown, such as the King and I, or Thai Sa On, and tastes surmountingly better than a place like Thai Boat.  The decor and ambience is kitschy,  fun and chill.   The service is direct and straightforward. Be prepared to be proactive with your communication because this is how this place works. Do not expect white tablecloth service, because this is a very casual restaurant.  The bad... The place is located in a seedy hotel, so it's a little awkward, but look past it. That's my advice.  It's not supposed to be that place where it's upscale, trendy and pricey. Set your expectations and go eat there!  The ugly... I honestly can't think of any ugliness.  In fact, I like it for what it is. I do wish they were opened for longer hours since their food is so good!"}
{"text":"This restaurant used to be across the street at the Best Western, but has now relocated to the Pointe Inn. From the outside, the hotel's aging, low-star appearance may turn you off from venturing into the restaurant  inside, but that would be a mistake.  This is some of the best Thai food in the city, from the soup to the standard Thai curries, every dish I've had is full of flavour. The portions are large, the prices are reasonable, and the staff is friendly and quick. Highlights include the Pad Thai, Mountain of Shrimp, and any of the curries."}
{"text":"I have been to White Elephant twice so far. I had the veggie spring rolls and the chicken green curry with mixed vegetables. The chicken was well cooked through and tender like its supposed to be. Both items were outstanding and I look forward to having them again and trying new ones. They have a spicey-heat scale of 1-4, where 1 is medium. I chose 4 and yikes it was impressively hot. The spices taste rich and fresh. I found the staff to be friendly and accomodating. The portion sizes are very generous so you will probably take some home with you. Great place."}
{"text":"Great food but absolutely terrible service. It's too bad the staff has such bad attitudes. Really ruins the experience!"}
{"text":"Never had Thai food done like this. Done well like this. Cooked well like this. Served well like this. Eaten well like this.  I'm glad a group of us Yelpers congregated here on a Monday night because half of us have been here while the other half didn't know what to quite expect. Walking into the hotel and into the restaurant made me feel like I was checking out an indie concert at the Legion downtown. When we sat in the place was small but cozily decorated with anything that would remind you that you set foot into a Thai restaurant.  Our server couldn't understand us too well, I guess she wasn't the usual owners in charge. She didn't want to take on the challenge of picking out our food so it was understandable. But she also didn't remember one of our dishes and insisted it wasn't mentioned.  Seriously. Even with the burps in service miscommunication, this place served solid dishes. Really solid dishes.   We started out with a few appetizers and a bowl of soup. The veggie spring rolls tasted fresh and the peanut sauce complimented it perfectly. The chicken and coconut soup was a wet dream for foodies: the kaffir lime leaves brought a refreshing sour component to the already savoury-sweet broth of the soup.  Their eggplant and tofu curry dish was inspiring. We have a potluck coming up and I might just try and emulate the experience I had from this dish for a recipe idea I have. Their penang tofu was worth the wait and the confusion of ordering. I thought I was done for but when this came, I shoved some room in my stomach just to savour it's curry soup.  Finally their coconut rice. I almost doomed the group by ordering regular rice, but Julia shook her head at me and said \"you gotta go coconut all the way or go home\" and so I did. The coconut rice was tasty enough to eat by itself, but with the beef bamboo shoot stir fry, it was like tasting the final battle to bloodsport, where JCVD was about to serve sweet justice to Bolo. It tasted like VICTORY.  I could go on about how their pad thai is the MOVES and should be placed on metal rings for engagement proposals. Or I could ramble on about how their banana spring rolls with coconut ice cream could be the best dessert that exists in that city quadrant.  But no, because I'll be back White Elephant, like a bad action movie sequel, you best believe I'll be back."}
{"text":"set at the bottom of the best western hotel i was staying at, i didn't expect anything great. i decided to go with it anyway since i'm on a hunt to travel around north america, finding the best thai food in the states/canada.  surprised i was, with great food at regular prices (~$10/noodle dish)! i had the pad see ew and fresh spring rolls, which were all homemade in the small BW kitchen. the spring rolls are delicious with the sauces provided, it compares relatively well with other thai places i've been to for sure. however the pad see ew noodles were kind of too starchy, like it wasn't cooked enough. they also call you down if you stay at the hotel or bring it up, which is nice.  however, they apparently have 2 websites which is not ok!!! i only found out when my spring rolls were $10 instead of $8, which was clearly stated on the website as $8. the young lady told me about how they had 2 websites, something they need to fix.  overall, 3.5 stars, rounded down to 3 stars. it would have been a solid 4 if not for 1) their 2 websites with 2 prices and the uncooperating employee (wtf?); and 2) the noodles which were just slightly too chewy for my personal tastes."}
{"text":"This place is amozing! We had veggie spring rolls, green curry w coconut rice, phad Thai and Tom yum soup. Best tom yum soup ever! Green curry was unreal delicious. Prices pretty decent as well. Gave four stars because the phad Thai was way too spicy( we only asked for 3/5) and the service was pretty bad even once seated. Definetly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  How could such a bizarre locations house such an incredibly delicious Thai restaurant.  Maybe that's what gives it the extra unexpected charm. The food is absolutely incredible and the value is superb for the amount of food that you get.   We started with the fried tofu and the coconut based soup.  Although the tofu could be argued to be meh, the freshness and crispiness gave it a meh plus grade.  The soup on the other hand was a five star easily.  We had it with the shrimp which was very fresh and plump.   We had the Penang curry with shrimp.  We couldn't believe the size of the order.  The sauce was amazing especially with the \"real\" coconut rice.  Hands down the best coconut rice and curry dish combo. Our least favourite was the se-we noodle dish.  We thought the noodle vs meat ratio was not balanced ie not enough noodles.  It wasn't that it was average tasting, it was that relative to the other dishes this was not in the same league.  But still tasty nonetheless. Overall:  solid 5.   Unless you are looking for high end setting and atmosphere.  I rather enjoyed the simpleness of the setting and the great food.  Service was friendly and efficient also."}
{"text":"Was totally amazed how good the food was here ! Love this place I will be back to try more of the menu!!"}
{"text":"To tell you the truth we were a bit skeptical when we walked in as it seemed like an odd place for a Thai restaurant. Still, we gave it a go. We did not have a reservation, but since it was a Monday, we got a table right away.   We were bummed when we could not get a fresh spring roll as apparently those are only made fresh on weekends. Still, we got a prawn salad for an appetizer and it was awesome. TIP... don't get the level 5 spicy! We had to drink LOTS of water and it was a bit much for us. Level 3 was perfect.  For the entree's the waitress helped us choose the healthiest options on the menu and we both got a story fry. The flavors were AMAZING and you definitely got your money's worth. Very affordable.   We will for sure come here again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"DO NOT LET LOCATION FREAK YOU OUT! Located in a building that looks scary and rundown some of the best Thai of life. And I have eaten Thai around the world. Just go for it."}
{"text":"Usually a long wait here (at least the two times I've come) but it's worth it for the food. I believe you also get the best bang for your buck here for Thai food considering most of the dishes with meat come with a large amt of protein.   Dishes I would definitely recommend: pad Thai with chicken, basil stir fry with chicken and the coconut rice is a MUST order! I have ordered the pineapple fried rice & pad see ew as well and it was quite bland :( I'm also not too fond of the beef dishes because the beef is overcooked but that goes down to personal preference since I like my stir fry beef to be cooked medium."}
{"text":"Strange location (inside the Pointe Inn), down a dingy hallway, but worth finding.  Odd mix of great food and strange practices.  Two small rooms, nicely set tables, some with \"reserved\" placards on them, but your $2.50 coke is served in the can.  I got the Pad Kee Mao (they call it Drunkard Noodles) with chicken.  I tried to order my dinner with 4 stars but the waiter talked me out of it.  Three was a nice burn, but don't go by me (I am a firebreather); you need to be hardcore to do 4.  The PKM was a flavorful balance of mix of meat, vegetables, sauce and noodles, but I would have preferred more noodles.  The Mango and Sticky Rice for dessert was excellent; best I've had.  Outstanding food.  I only deducted one star because of the setting, location and atmosphere (or lack thereof).  Prices are a little on the high side (PKM = $14), but the portion size was large; enough for two normal people, or me!  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Hole in a wall Thai Resto! bEst thai resto in the city. Definitely going back for more."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favourite thai restaurant! I always order the matssaman curry, pad Thai, chicken satay skewer and their Thai ice tea. The flavours are there! The only thing is that it is a little hard to find but if you go into the lobby of the travelers inn and walk down the hall it will be on your left side."}
{"text":"Had heard this place was the best Thai restaurant in Calgary. Those are fighting words so I had to come since Thai food is hands down my favorite. We arrived on a Wednesday night to a 30 minute wait. Not too bad since I've waited close to an hour and half in Houston for Thai Gourmet. That place has lines like none other so this was fine.   We get called and seated and we start off by ordering their tom yum soup. It's a pretty damn good soup. Flavorful and came steaming hot. We also ordered the tofu pad Thai, pineapple fried rice, and beef massamun curry w a side of coconut rice. Portions are massive so if you're into eating a lot of food, this is your place. The pad Thai was your generic pad Thai you can get anywhere. It was covered in a sticky sweet sauce and reminded me of fast food pad Thai. The curry looked more like a soup and the beef was dry, tough, and chewy. Terrible beef. We just skipped it. The pineapple fried rice was pretty good. Nothing special about it but I enjoyed it. The coconut rice was also pretty delicious.   Not sure how this place became so popular since food was so regrettably average. How can this be the best Thai in Calgary?! Come on guys!"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend in December as we both mentioned wanting to try the food after hearing rave reviews online and from others. To get to the restaurant is a little tricky, I was lead into a Denny's parking lot by my GPS thinking it was a cruel joke by my friend (ie Let's do Thai! I lied, we are doing Denny's). Luckily my friend was not being a trickster and we ended up inside the neighbouring hotel lobby and asked the front desk where the restaurant was. You need to go into the hotel lobby, follow the long corridor to the end of the hall, and a short turn to the right will bring you to the door of the restaurant. Strange, I know. The place was already getting busy, luckily with only two of us we were easy to sit down at a corner table. We were given menus and some time to ponder over them. I have had minimal Thai food in my life, some restaurant and some homemade, so I was planning on sticking with what I knew generally. I ended up getting a green curry, and my friend a pad thai; we then shared a dish thinking we would need the extra food. Nope, so wrong. The first dish was very tasty, was a chicken and veggie medley, we still had some left over at the end of our night. Then our dishes came out, we really should have invited more people! The pad thai was huge as was my bowl of green curry, which was more like a soup with large chunks of tofu, broccoli and ginger. I ordered some rice on the side to help soak up the liquid and add some \"meat\" to the dish. Everything was delicious though! Full of flavour, very light, and plenty to go around. I highly recommend when going with a group to order just a couple dishes that can be shared as the quantities are large enough. As is the culture of Thailand and many other Asian countries, food is meant to be shared amongst those at the table. So embrace the culture and the food when visiting White Elephant :) The service, despite it being a busy night, was very good, albeit the restaurant can get a bit loud due to the close quarters."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Love the soups, they are a good portion too. The red curry is also tasty!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great food! Not the nicest looking restaurant but the food will impress! Service is not top notch but it works."}
{"text":"If Yelp had half stars, I would rate this place a 3.5/5. I've never had real Thai food from Thailand so I can't comment on how authentic this place is.   PROS - Awesome tom yum soup, definitely the highlight of our meal!  - Huge portions, we spent about $50 for two and there were so much left overs... For the amount we ordered, it would have been good for at least four people. - Very friendly service - when we asked to pack our left overs and asked for extra containers, they were extremely quick and always smiled at us.  CONS - The food was good, but I didn't think anything was amazing. I found our main entrees, the curry, coconut rice and the pad thai, to be a bit too sweet. The pad thai was also too wet for my liking. - Maybe you can't judge a place by how it looks, but the outside of this place looks like it's falling apart.. The inside isn't that small, but seems very modest to say the least.  When we came in for dinner, it seemed like every table had a reserved sign on it. I would highly recommend that you make reservations in advance if you want to try out this place. We might go back for the tom yum soup but not sure if we'll try anything else. Perhaps our expectations were too high after reading all the hype on Yelp and Urbanspoon.."}
{"text":"I'm having curry sweat.   Amazing.   Be cautious that the portions are enough for two.    Delicious tom Yom koong hot pot is huge and the prawns a plenty.    The pad suew beef is fantastic.   This place is hopping.    Always busy.   Very good idea to get there early.    You might not get in if you come late.   Go here for amazing food."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and this place deserves a high five.  Great food that was made for take out and made it all the way across the city without being a pile of mush.  Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I have little to add above what the other 5 star reviews of White Elephant have mentioned (actually, the less than 5 star reviews are also accurate).   Part of me wishes that there were no reviews of this place, that it wasn't on the map, that it would remain unknown. Because it's already impossible to get a spot here without white elephant luck (they might be closed, full, or understaffed). And by adding another 5 star review I'm just decreasing my chances of getting in without excessive luck.   The taste of the food here is simply magical."}
{"text":"The food here is good...really good. If you can get past a few things this place could be your favorite thai place in Calgary...  - they are open from 5:30-8:30pm - they only take cash - they are located in Shadyville motel  - it looks like my 4 year old neice decorated the place - we waited 1.5 hrs for a table  Besides that...the food rocks and that's what you're coming for....just do take out like everyone else."}
{"text":"Awesome food! Very clean tasting. Clear flavors. Once your belly is full... you're pleasantly content with quality healthy food!  Service is a little slow and could use improvement... but it stays true to the, slow pace, Thai way ;-)  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Earning five stars out of five on websites like Yelp is no easy feat; it is natural to believe that food critics are often the toughest critics, but the truth cannot be so far away. People complain and turn from love to hate from things that may not seem so important at all to others - for example, something as petty as the drapes on the windows of a restaurant. So for White Elephant to have achieved a near 5/5 rating on a website where ratings are done by average civilians is an achievement that cannot be ignored. This restaurant has something going on that must have impressed almost every single one of the randomly visiting people who decided to share their experiences on here. Without doing further research, I decided to experience this restaurant myself while accompanied by my lovely parents who are also experienced diners of authentic Thai cuisine.   Now, this restaurant has the highest refusal rate I've ever witnessed; it was turning away all the customers (except for one group of two) who did not make reservation. And one would have to be unreasonable to blame them; they consistently had people coming in and leaving, one group after another. There was not a single time that I saw a table being vacant for more than ten minutes. After seeing just how many people were getting rejected without being offered an option to come back later, my parents and I became excited. The fact was, we were sitting in one of the most popular restaurants - if not the most popular - Thai restaurant in Calgary.   We ordered the papaya salad as the appetizer, and it was phenomenal; it was, in fact, the best I had since I left Thailand. The balance between spiciness from hot peppers, saltiness from fish sauce, and sweet, crunchiness from papaya was flawless. Okay, may be it was a tad too spicy, but my family and I do love spicy food so it was fine.   For the main course, we ordered Guay-Tiew with Chicken, fish with chili sauce, Pad Gra Pow with pork, and green curry with mix veggies. Guay-Tiew, which came first, was delicious. The broth of the soup tasted exactly how it was prepared in Thailand. It brought back many pleasant memories; my parents and I could not help but talk about the times and beautiful places where we ordered and ate exactly the same thing decades ago. Then came the green curry dish. I was rather worried about this dish, because the papaya salad alone was unexpectedly spicy, plus the green curry is known to be spicier than red or yellow curry. However, when I took the first spoonful of it, I heard myself saying - almost subconsciously so - \"too sweet\". My parents looked at me and nodded in agreement; feeling skeptical of my own first opinion of the curry, I tried it again. The excessive sweetness was still there. Also, the flavour of coconut milk was at the verge of overwhelming that of curry. I couldn't understand this.   Once Pad Gra Pow came out and I tried a bite, I had the same thought again; it was just too sweet. Sure, I always appreciated the inclusion of sweet flavour in Thai cuisine, but the Pad Gra Pow was just excessive. I forced myself to have four bites before I gave up, hoping that I would be able to fill up my stomach with another dish we ordered - fish with chili sauce. My parents and I were looking forward to this dish after reading the description provided in the menu, which made it sound exactly like our favourite fish dish from Thailand. When the dish finally came, my parents and I were even more ecstatic; it looked the same as the one we enjoyed so much during our short time in Thailand. All three of us dug in, and looked at each other after we've all had our mouthful. They didn't have to say a word for me to realize that they were thinking the exact same thing as I was. The fish was too sweet and not at all spicy. I didn't even look at the dish afterwards; my parents took a few bites, but they weren't able to finish it off either.   I won't take back what I said about papaya salad and Guay-Tiew; they were prepared just as my parents and I remembered from our experience in Thailand. However, the green curry, Pad Gra Pow, and Fish w/ Chili Sauce were more than a mere disappointment. They were just utterly revolting; they tasted as though they contained more sugars than pastries from Starbucks. While White Elephant Thai cuisine claims its offerings to be authentic to the culture of Thailand, I have no recollection of any Thai food being as sweet as what the chefs at the restaurant were preparing.   After the visit, would I recommend this restaurant? Not if you are hoping to experience the authentic Thai cuisine with its neutral balance of sweetness, spiciness and saltiness. But the fact that numerous members of Yelp gave high ratings of this restaurant still stands; therefore, I will leave it to your expectations to decide whether this restaurant is right for you or not.   Thanks for reading the review."}
{"text":"Being an Asian myself, terrible service in an Asian restaurant rarely bothers me, but this place might actually went beyond my tolerance.  Let's put that on the side and talk about their food first.  I have to admit some of their dishes were pretty tasty despite it took a long time to come out. We ordered: Tom Kha Gai (chicken coconut soup) Panang curry with Tofu  Pad Thai with beef Chicken with Cashew Nuts  The soup itself was really flavourful and the amount of lime juice was right on, but the chicken was really overcooked.  The Panang curry probably is the best in Calgary, although some might find it is too spicy (I can eat really hot and it didn't bother me).  The Pad Thai tasted tangy but they put too much sauce in the noodle and their Pad Thai is VERY SPICY HOT (yet they did not mention that in their menu).    Chicken with Cashew Nuts... We ordered the Pad Thai for our kids and since it was too spicy for them, we ordered this dish for them afterward.  This dish is almost like orange chicken that you can get from a food court Chinese stall except they charged you double the price here.  The deep fried chicken was so dry and hard.    I guess two ok dishes + one really good dish + one absolutely junk = 3 stars.  One thing that I noticed was the kitchen seemed to be cooking one dish in big batch each time.  You would see the server bring out 3 - 4 plates of Pad Thai at once, then 10 minutes later, the person would bring out 3 - 4 bowls of curry.  In term of service, there is practically none.  First we had to ask for bowls for our soup. Then when we found out their Pad Thai was crazy screaming hot, I talked to the owner?manager? and his response was \"our Pad Thai is for adult... you should order mild for kids\" ... well, #1 not all adults can eat spicy, #2 you never mentioned or offered the option to reduce spicy level despite you saw my two kids were at the table.   I don't think he was trying to be rude, but being empathetic was definitely not his forte.   All in all, come here for the food and remember to check with the spice level.  For us, we probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Ok first off it's not about the location but about the food. White elephant is in a motel that I don't even remember the name of. You walk down the hall to a beaded door and find a restaurant or eating area that at first seems like a \"ok let's get the hell out of here\" moment, but please look past this. We waited for five minutes for a seat which was fine. Oh yeah you have to ask for a key to use the washroom which I thought was awesome and totally fit in with this place. Service was slow but man when the food arrived wow was it worth it. Had the pork ginger stir fry,the red curry with pineapple, and the shrimp with coconut milk soup. The soup was a flavor explosion in itself. Everything was better than any thai food I have had since I lived in Portland oregan and maybe better. So look past the dive appearance and love a little without judgement, you won't be disappointed. Oh yeah we were given an industrial soap dispenser as a gift for valued guests when leaving which totally made the night...."}
{"text":"I hate Thai food at times. But I can't get enough of this place?! The food quality makes up for the sketchy atmosphere. I fly in from 3k miles with my work colleagues every week, and crave the coconut soup spicy number 3."}
{"text":"White Elephant is the very definition of a love-hate relationship. You have to allot 2 hours to dine here. There's always a lineup 15 minutes before they open.   Based on my experience, I can offer the most important tip for eating here: look up their menus beforehand and order as soon as you sit down. We took our sweet time going over the menu and we ended up getting our food last even though we were one of the first tables to be seated. The tables who sat down after us got their food before us. They even paid and left before our appetizer even came out.   We put in our order at 5:20, got our food at 6:30, and we paid at 6:50. An hour to get food is really ridiculous right? We read the reviews and we knew what we were getting ourselves into, but an hour is way too long even for the most patient diners. It doesn't help that there's one server getting beverages and taking everyone's orders. The other two bus servers must be the owner's kids, hence the odd times they're open (open at 5, closed at 8). Some tables even got up and left from the lack of service. All this was somewhat forgotten when our food came out.   The portions and flavors of their food did not disappointing. We ordered the papaya salad, red curry with pineapples and chicken, coconut rice and spicy stir  fried beef noodles. The aromas of the rice and curry were uplifting and the noodles were seasoned appropriately, not too sweet or salty. The portions are so large we had enough for three more meals.   Thus is the love-hate relationship. Hate the wait, love the food. Get take out instead."}
{"text":"I read all the good reviews on here and decided I had to go and see for myself what all the hype was about.  Firstly I found the staff to be quite friendly, and while somewhat difficult to understand their service was very fast, contrary to what I've heard.  Making a reservation was impossible, I finally ended up going down in person to do it.   I was told they do not take reservations on Friday since it is booked for private function.  If you want to book a reservation you must call between 3 & 5 PM.  The White Elephant opens at 5 except on Sundays, and are not open for lunch.  When we arrived for our reservation at 5, they were not ready yet and were still preparing.  Our hungry party could not enter  until 5:15 and this was quite  annoying. We waited there in the crowed hotel hallway, feeling very out of place in this seedy joint, there amongst the rent by night rooms.   The restaurant was basically empty then but by 6:30 most of the larger tables had filled up.   Smaller groups could still easily be seated without a reservation.  The restaurant was relatively clean but smells dank and moldy, like the hotel, and at (was it my imagination?) as little rose from possibly a nearby out of order public bathroom??? I think so and I wasn't the only one that thought that.  Almost all the diners were ethnic.   The waiter immediately served up immediately a couple of carafes of fridge cooled water, and it was ice cold, making it a good start to the evening.   The  h'ordeurves  that I chose were delicious and I thought we were going to be in for a real treat.  We asked the manager/waiter what he would recommend and he happily offered us 5 suggestions for their famous top dishes.  They arrived quickly and our experience continued to go downhill.     I found almost every dish was sickingly rich, was all pretty mushy and all tasted like it was all cooked in the same pot of peanut oil.  Not one of us felt compelled to finish their plate.  Our bill came to $140 for 5 dishes, 2 h'ordeurves and 6 beer.    Payment was a little awkward.  The place is so small you practically have to stand in the kitchen to settle up.    I am pretty sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"Really good food! I was honestly surprised with my fiancé about how good the food turned out based on the location and look of the place. Just goes to show you that some of the best places to eat are the ones that don't look like a million bucks.  We were in Calgary after a great trip into the Rockies (Banff / Lake Louise / Hot springs ), and needed a place to stay the night and eat before our flight.  The WETC was closing, but they accommodated us by giving us a large takeout order which we brought back to our hotel room.  Food was promptly consumed and bellies were rubbed.  IF I was to do it again, I would go back to this place for Thai, very good food!"}
{"text":"One word: WOW! I've been hearing about this place for the last few years and the last 2 times I went I was unsuccessful....you know what they say - 3rd times a charm!  This is situated in kind of a ghetto area in the pointe inn and the ambiance is cafeteria-esque... Needless to say the food more than made up for all of that!  I went with my family (4) and we ordered the pad-se-ew, the red Thai curry with chicken, green Thai curry with chicken, coconut rice and papaya mango salad   The mango salad was really good and super spicy which was an unexpected surprise! The pad-se-ew was really good but there weren't enough noodles in the dish, I should have opted for the pad Thai...interestingly enough bc of the close seating arrangements we started chatting up the table next to us and they offered us some of their pad Thai which was excellent!! Not the best I've ever had but definitely the best in Calgary!   The red and green curry were DELICIOUS!! My brother was with us and he said it tasted just like the curry he had in Thailand!   The coconut rice added that extra level of completion to the meal...just the right amount of coconut!!   All in all I'd say that you gotta eat here!! Drop what you're doing and go here! And come early - they are only open from 5-8pm, so expect to wait anywhere from 5min to upwards of an hour, but it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Thai food in Calgary hands down!! Seriously so yummy and authentic - haven't found any other place that serves Khao soi so I am super stoked!   This restaurant is only open three hours a day - from 5 to 8 pm! I know it's so crazy but with food this good people still line up for it including myself haha   It is located inside a hotel so the entrance is literally a hole in the wall and there's no option of making a reservation. You need to make your way there at 5 pm and put your name down and then wait in a nearby waiting room until you are called in. The service once you are seated is pretty quick though.   We ordered the panang curry with coconut rice, crispy tofu, pad sew and the Khao soi of course. This was way too much food for two people because the portion sizes are pretty huge. The Khao Soi was really amazing I honestly can't stop telling people about it - it was just like the one that I had in Thailand. The coconut rice was less sticky compared to the other restaurants but I really enjoyed it. The pad sew had just the perfect amount of sauce and the panang curry was really flavourful. The tofu was ok, it was too dry and oily for me so its not something I would order again. I really want to try out their other curries next time though! The prices are really reasonable for the amount of food that you get as well.   Just a note for when you come here - dress in layers because it is crazy hot inside so you will need to take off some layers to feel comfortable inside and also they don't take credit cards!"}
{"text":"Heard so much about this place. I had the  Pad Thai ,the chicken was  chewy .  Big portions All in all disappointed Food is so so .  Also bad smell when you are there. Probably due to the age as mentioned it is in a whole in the wall Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I don't understand the over-the-top glowing reviews for this place, given that people seem to come for the food. For Thai food I thought it was just ok. The proper flavors were mostly there, but I was not wowed. Granted, I have eaten outstanding Thai food in many cities and have high standards.  My husband, on the other hand, thought his dish was very good.    However, my dining experience was soured by poor service. As reviewers have pointed out, the wait is horrid, they don't take reservations, and the service is disorganized at best. We knew there would be a wait for a table, but I felt we were poorly treated. The waitress was about to seat my party of 3 adults (including 1 senior) + 1 child in an empty table in front, there were 3 chairs at the table and the waitress was going to pull up another chair and put a booster seat on it.  Then the owner (or manager?) said no, they can't put another seat there (why? there was space...) and instead they sat a couple down who clearly knew one of the staff.  So, we had to leave and wait in the lobby for a very long time.  Once we were seated, we also had to wait a long time to order.  Our food orders were taken after another table, even though we were seated before them.  Our meals also took a long time to come out (and of course we were served last).  I was quite disappointed by the lack of consideration for the fact that we had a hungry young child who was being forced to wait unnecessarily.  Then the proprietor (?) who had first refused us a table was finally cheerful when we he saw that we were ordering full dinners for everyone including the child (whose dish was most expensive).    A few things about the facilities: when we were there the bathroom situation was sketchy, be sure to knock before using the key to enter, because somehow people were getting walked in on while using the toilet. I read a review somewhere saying there is a small kid's play area / playground, which we were excited about, but in fact it is private, and young guests may not play there.  This of course devastated the child in our party.   I am giving this 3 stars overall because, if you are prepared for inconsistent service and a long wait, and maybe a questionable bathroom situation, you can enjoy decent Thai food, which is not common in Calgary.  I would really not recommend this for families with young children."}
{"text":"White Elephant Thai Cuisine is one of those restaurants that I've been wanting to try for ages. Seriously, for the past few months, I've been all gung ho and telling friends \"let's go check out White Elephant\" and each time, I never manage to make it. So sad because it just screams my type of restaurant. When you call a restaurant a hole in the wall, this is the epitome of that description. Random location? Check. Sketchy hotel? Check. Hard to find and terrible hours (5:00pm to 8:30pm only)? Check, check, check.  Well, lo and behold, the stars were aligned and I was finally able to check it out with a friend on a busy Saturday evening. We arrived around 7pm or so and we were told the wait would be around 30 minutes. Not bad, we put our names down and went back outside to snack on some food we had in the car (we were starved - don't judge). After 20 minutes, we walked back into the lobby and heard a waitress calling our name (hello perfect timing). Located in the Airport Travellers Inn (funny how so many people consider it \"seedy\"), walk past the lobby and through a hallway to the magical black door. And of course it's unmarked, adding to it's charm or would that be considered its mystery?  - Thai iced tea ($4.50) - probably the best Thai iced tea I've had in Canada. The colour was different from the norm. Just order one!  - Tom yum goon ($7.00 small) - shrimp, mushroom, tomato, lemon leaves, lemon grass, galangal, chili, and lime juice. The small is the perfect size for two. We asked for level 3 (you can get level 1 to 4) and it had a nice bit of heat to it. I'll try level 4 next time though. A very generous portion of shrimps (think there were about 5-6 big pieces). This is what you call heaven in a bowl.  - Fish with garlic and black pepper ($21.00) - tilapia fish deep fried with garlic, black pepper, steamed vegetables and sauce on the side. Yes, we ordered a whole fish (you can get a smaller, fillet version for $17.50). We wanted to try their steamed fish but they were out of it for the evening. Oh well, this one was grilled with all the fish bones included. The fish was tasty but a bit difficult to maneuver with all the bones still inside. Make sure you dip each piece in the sauce - super addictive. My friend loooved this dish more than I did so I let her go to town on it.  - Crispy egg noodle ($16.00) - deep fried egg noodles, soup stock, broccoli, carrot, peas and  your choice of meat. The noodles come on top - make sure you mix everything so that they get nicely coated. The noodles were tasty and the sauce was rich, almost creamy. It was good but next time I want to try another noodle dish.  - Thai green curry with chicken ($16.00) - green chilli with coconut milk and lime leaves. Choice of mix veggies or thai eggplant. Obviously, we went with eggplant (my fav!). Again, portions are crazy generous with lots of eggplant, chicken and other vegetables. Their plating is hilarious with massive glass Tupperware. The green curry was fantastic and flavourful. I'd order it again in a heartbeat.  - Coconut rice ($4.00 small) - I was considering getting a large order of coconut rice ($6.50) but my friend was smart and convinced me to get just the small. A wise choice as we ordered WAY too much stuff. Easily could have fed four people from all of the food we ordered.  Happy I finally was able to try out White Elephant while I was in town. Don't forget, it's cash only (don't worry, there's an ATM inside the hotel lobby if you forget). Tasty food and good portions, you can't ask for much more. Well, better hours and being open Sunday's would be nice but life just ain't fair so deal with it."}
{"text":"One of the best thai food I have eaten - I came on a visit to Calgary and we tried this restaurant, we didn't get a place to sit (they were full even if you are willing to wait for an hour), so we decided to do take away. Yellow Chicken & Basil fried rice was our main course and I think we have leftovers which would be sufficient for lunch :) and both were delicious."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! I live in Edmonton but every time I go to Calgary is a must stop for thai food!!! Love the green curry and the thai ice tea!!!! The place is very hide and small and always is a line up to get inside!!! I don't give 5 stars because the service is very slow!! So if you go for the first time you should look at the menu before, so as soon as you sit you order what you want!! Last time I was there it was not bussy and they brought our food really fast but still take in mind that they can be very slow the first time I went took them 30min in taking my order and another 45min to bring my food, but even that they can be slow I just keep going because of the food!!!! You wont be disappointed by the food even if u have to wait long!!! A must stop to eat even if you are not from Calgary!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ! Authentic. My first time in Calgary ( from Toronto)  I was dying for some real food. I must say this was good! We had pad thai, spring rolls and green curry chicken. I was there with a friend who doesn't eat a lot if spice so got all in med spice but I needed my heat... I asked for some fish sauce and he made me a special fish sauce with chillies 'nam pla prik' And pretty much drank it ! Very tasty. The approach to the restaurant is a bit scary.  ... It's in a motel but the actual restaurant was like you were transported to a little hut in Phuket. So don't be afraid. Just go. Order. Eat. Enjoy.  Wish I could come back soon so I can try their other dishes."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best tasting Thai restaurants I've tried. The issue is that they're really busy, and for good reason!!! If you get there at opening time of 5pm expect to wait for takeout. The norm is about 45 minutes. I've never tried dining in. Thai food tastes fine as takeout except for fried fish. All the curries are really good. Their portions are large so it justifies the prices. Get their papaya salad and make sure you don't go too spicy (unless you're a complete freak for Thai chili peppers!) I love their coconut rice! I can't give it 5 stars because I really don't like where it is situated inside of a hotel and the decor is something out of the 80's. Other than that the service is great. They're a really friendly bunch of folk that run the place."}
{"text":"5 stars.  This is the best Thai food in Calgary and among the best Thai food you are likely to find anywhere within or without Thailand..    The strength of the Whte Elephant is the richness and complexity of its spice and flavour profile.  The food is simple, authentic and delicious.  Omnipresent dishes such as green curry are elevated here. The diversity of the menu also delivers- no misses on the board.  Weaknesses?  There are two.  First- The restaurant is located in one of the sketchiest motels in the city.  You've been warned.  Second- the word is out on this place and they can't accommodate the demand on the weekend.  If you call for takeout between Thursday to Sunday they might not pick up the phone.  Ultimately this amounts to an eat-in experience that offers great food and polite if overwhelmed service and a vicarious visit to a transient yet consistently stabby part of town.    This place is the embodiment of a hidden treasure.  If they were in Mission or Bridgeland or whatever your local Williamsburg you'd pay 3 times as much and not blink an eye.  Tip them well and maybe they can move in a few years."}
{"text":"If the whole Thai experience of great food, sub-par service and questionable environment is what you're looking for, this is the right place for you. Located in a sketchy motel of variable clientele, walking in here always reminds me of that one time I accidentally on purpose got lost in Bangkok. Admittedly, the food here 2-3 years ago was MUCH better which made the location more bearable, but in terms of what Thai food is supposed to be, this place still nails it hands down. Their green and red curries are my favorite although, on my last visit I noticed it was a bit thinned out from what it used to be. The flavors were still there just not as strong or noteworthy. It wouldn't stop me from coming here, but not craving it like I once used to.   What takes so many points of this place though is the absolute lack of service. It's not even sub-par, it can just be downright rude. Some of you might be into that, but for the majority who prefer not being mean mugged, the best thing to do here is take it with a grain of salt. They do it to everyone.    It's not fancy, but then again Thai food really isn't meant to be so don't compare it to a fancy North American Thai restaurant. Who of you have actually gone to Thailand and sat down at a restaurant with heavy silverware, $20 curries and considered it great? Probably none - the best Pad Thai's I've ever had were $1 on a street so maybe the bad service is part of this appeal. In any case, the curries and low price relative to large portion sizes make it still worth coming. But, if they continue on the downward slide I can imagine the food not making the sketchy location or bad service worth it at all."}
{"text":"Amazing, delicious, fresh ingredients, cooked to perfection.  You can taste each individual flavour in the dish - best Thai food in Calgary!  To be clear, I am not a vegetarian, but some of my favourite dishes here are vegetarian dishes - if you want healthy delicious and reasonably priced fare, this is the place to go!  The ambiance is a little sketchy to be sure, but if it is a question of choosing three out of taste/value/health/ambiance, well they clearly made the best choice."}
{"text":"OMG. Move aside all Thai restaurants, this is the place to be.  The flavours. The aromas. The look. Thank you Yelp to revealing this gem of a restaurant.  Word of caution: cash only so please make sure to bring enough bills.  They also have an ATM out in the hotel lobby but it's a bit wonky. And they aren't open on Sundays.  Enough about that, back to the food. White Elephant is a place is to die for.    We ordered the Pad-Se Ew (so good!), Red Curry (delicious) and the famous, Coconut Rice. I swear, there's something magical in this cooking.   Highly recommend the coconut rice. Probably the best I've had. Will be back again and again.  5 stars. 5 BIG stars."}
{"text":"We came on a Thursday night thinking it would be an ok wait. The restaurant is tucked inside of the Pointe Inn motel, around the corner from front desk and down a hall. Popped in and it was packed. They made a table for us near the door, to fit us in, or the wait would have been an hour.  Started with the Thai iced tea to cool us down. Freaking delicious. Iced tea topped with evaporated and coconut milk mixed in. We got down to ordering: chicken skewers with peanut satay sauce - decent. tom yum goong - everything you want your tom yum to be. pineapple fried rice - too oily, had no pineapple, tasted like fried rice. green curry eggplant - tasty red curry chicken - very bold flavors and we finished this one quick  overall the portions were very generous. The sauces were delicious, made in house and the highlights of the meal. The food itself was a bit bland, undercooked and off. Most of it relied heavily on sauces. Given the amount of people dining at the hour, they must have been really rushing so I would definitely give this place another go, as other reviews and the awards on their counter speak for their usual experience."}
{"text":"It's seldom I can't wait to rush home and write my review for a restaurant. In fact, that's never - at least until today.   I've been to Thai restaurants before and I've always though, \"Yeah, that was pretty good.\" I've enjoyed the sauces and the spices and variety of dishes and flavours. Now, I'm remembering each place I've been and they've been left in the dust. If the food from White Elephant is indicative of what all Thai food should *actually* taste like, we've been fooling ourselves. Other Calgary restaurants are a three star at best.  When you're coming to White Elephant, you really are coming for the food. The hotel it's housed in is not one I would ever find myself staying in... you need a key to access the washrooms. Shady. But the food, oh my gawd, the food!   My dinner mates had all been there before and said we could just ask the server to order some things for us, all we had to say was that we wanted enough for however many were at the table and the dishes would just start to show up. Not the case tonight. We tried it. Our server sort of smiled and nodded and said, \"Yes! Sure. Ok.\" And then no food came. In the end, we did our own ordering. Can I recall what? Let's see. 3 items from the vegetarian menu - a tofu dish, an eggplant dish and something else with vegetables. 2 items from the meatarian menu - beef stir fry and pork pad thai. And soup. We also ate chicken skewers and spring rolls to start off. Oh, and 3 bowls of coconut rice. It was all good, but the flavour I'm remembering? The eggplant dish. Who knew! Shannon, you were so right about that.  Dessert, we shared. Deep fried bananas with coconut ice cream. Real bits of coconut in the ice cream. Definitely big enough to share between two people, but also really good.  Last point... holy Yelp balls was it ever reasonably priced! Outstanding food, coming home stuffed, $25 a person (most of us just had tea to drink).   Now, if you'll excuse me, I must go fantasy and relive my recent foodgasm."}
{"text":"I give White Elephant four Calgary stars.  More on this below.  We recently moved to Calgary from Seattle and have been pretty disappointed with the quality of the Thai and Indian restaurants we've encountered here; none seem particularly good compared to even the average restaurant back home.  Given that, White Elephant was a revelation -- easily the best Thai food we've tasted in Calgary so far.  We only ordered two entrees, the pad Thai with beef and yellow chicken curry, but both were very tasty with (mostly) well developed flavors.  Great, right?  Well, yes and no.  The main components of each dish (yellow curry sauce and the pad Thai noodles) were very flavorful, but the proteins (chicken and beef, respectively) were very bland.  My guess is that they keep tubs of precooked, minimally seasoned beef and chicken in the kitchen, and when someone orders a dish, they just toss in the requested proteins and give the dish a few cursory tosses to combine the ingredients before sending it out.  Also, we had to wait an unexpectedly long time (I want to say close to an hour) before we got our food.  Back home, these would be major gaffes and would drop my review score to three stars, but compared to the alternatives we've found so far in Calgary, White Elephant still deserves four stars -- albeit \"Calgary stars\".  As an aside, as others have pointed out, the restaurant's setting is comically seedy.  To get there, you have to walk through a rundown hotel lobby (complete with an ATM that uses Comic Sans font), down a claustrophobic hallway, and then open a nondescript and minimally ornamented door into the restaurant.  It's kind of like how I'd imagine a speakeasy, except this one sells Thai food instead of illegal booze."}
{"text":"Food is good, but due to they open only from 5-8 pm, so even we did not finish, the waiter tried to take our plats and forks. Need to eat and pay fast."}
{"text":"The chicken cashew is my favourite but the hot and spicy prawn soup is a close second. The food here is simply amazing and the portion sizes are too much for one person so bring a friend."}
{"text":"My sister and her friend went to a sample sale in the NE and when I went to pick them up, we were trying to think of a place to go for dinner.  All three of us are super indecisive so I just decided to start driving.  We were headed onto 16th avenue but on our way, we were passing this sketch ass hotel then I remembered someone mentioning that White Elephant was inside and it was really good Thai food.  I took the turn and rolled up to this dodgy hotel and parked in the back.  There is ample parking as White Elephant is located inside the hotel.  We entered the hotel, followed the sign, walked down the hall and arrived at our destination.  They have cute trinkets and displays of some food before you walk in and this wonderful aroma of thai food when you walk in.  It was Friday night around 7:45PM and it was busy so we had to wait 15 minutes.  We got seated within 10 minutes and handed menus as well as two glass bottles of water.  The couple next to us had some dishes and it looked amazing.  It took quite a while for them to take our order but they finally came by after they saw how hangry I was.  We ordered three dishes: shrimp pad thai, yellow beef curry with eggplant, and a chicken ginger stir fry along with a large coconut rice.  Shrimp pad thai with a side of crushed peanuts came first and I immediately helped myself.  There were nice big pieces of shrimp, noticeable amount of bean sprouts and the rice noodles were just perfect - sticky and not too soft with some cilantro on top, absolutely delicious.  Coconut rice, yellow beef curry and chicken ginger followed shortly.  I took a nice big heaping of the coconut rice and topped it off with some yellow curry and it was....I can't even. It was seriously SO GOOD!!!! Thankfully we went with yellow curry because I can handle heat but this was a little spicier than I anticipated.  It was so amazing that I sucked it up and continued to eat...even though my tongue was burning and I polished the two bottles of water off.  My eyes were even watering a tad bit but I still continued to eat!! (I'm a baby when it comes to curry, I like it mild-med but I think this was a smidge over med heat - nonetheless still amazing).  The eggplant was a nice texture to the curry, nice thin pieces of beef and of course the heavenly curry.  Now the rice, I really did love the coconut rice..I thought it was a hype but nope!  Sticky coconut rice that you can actually taste coconut!  I could eat up a whole large order to myself!  I thought the chicken ginger stir fry was OK - deep fried pieces of chicken with some carrot, broccoli, and cauliflower pieces. This dish was my least favorite - maybe because everything else was soo bomb.    The three of us happily finished the majority of the food and were stuffed to the bone.  Like the kind of stuffed you know that you've reached your limit but you continue to eat.  Our overall experience was pretty good although the service lacked, the food made up for the lackluster service.  White Elephant is now my favorite Thai food place!  I'm happy we risked our lives heading to this dodgy hotel but we made it out alive ;)    White Elephant Thai Cuisine FTW!"}
{"text":"Calgary's most overrated restaurant, I'm sure.  Awful location and space. This place was hard to find. It's inside a roach hotel in the NE. It's tiny, old, and kinda dirty. The layout is really awkward.  Poor service. I love it when the staff talks loudly amongst each other in a foreign language about you. They also made us switch tables after we were seated so they could sit a bigger party next to us. No apologies. Our server wore a hoodie with rolled up sleeves, jeans, and sneakers. I found the food came somewhat quickly but our cheque took forever. They only accept cash, which is super annoying.   The food was good, but it wasn't special. The portions were average and so was the quality. Prices were high considering how much they must pay for that nasty little space.   You'd think a hole-in-the-wall, cash-only, positively reviewed restaurant would have incredibly cheap and delicious food with outstanding service. Quite the contrary! I will be going back to Thai Bistro for my chicken satay and green curry fixes."}
{"text":"This hole-in-the-wall is worth the drive to NE Calgary. Tiny, crowded, hidden in an old hotel was an unexpected gem. The food we ordered was delicious, mind you, not everything on the menu was available.  It is only open from 5 - 8 pm, so plan accordingly."}
{"text":"This is my purpose of being--I review hidden gems, therefore I am.   I enjoy finding restaurants run by passionate owners out of the way, in alleys or behind buildings, hidden in urban sprawls, known to enough to keep the business going and appreciated by all that patronize it.  It's not important I impact that restaurant's reputation.  I could be the first to stand and scream \"Spartacus\" or the last--the point is making the stand.    I'm not going to indulge the fact that a hidden gem rewarded as the best of its kind in town can no longer be classed as a hidden gem, no matter how difficult it is to get to.  The theory of group consensus begins with a single voice which others share.  But it's the second voice which really turns the shower into a storm--the one that causes the mob to form.  I won't even claim to be the first or second in support of White Elephant Thai Cuisine.  I don't even think I'm the thirtieth.  I'm just another in the crowd showing support for this out of the way treasure literally walled off from the city behind by a fence-line more apt for a prison.  I'm not even exaggerating; my navigation system led me past a pedestrian hotel I refused to believe was the location I was seeking.  I parked across the street in front of a Tim Hortons and stared puzzled at my iPhone.  I had to double check the diminutive sign over a door I thought only led into a hotel hallway.  The first step was to navigate around the towering fence, like some concentration camp from Red Dawn.  This involved circumnavigating almost the entire block and approaching the door under the sign...which was not the entrance at all, and I was redirected back over to the hotel entrance.  There are hidden gems and then there are buried treasures, and this is the latter.    If I didn't know better, I'd believe White Elephant was built out of two hotel rooms, like the owners bought out two rooms and squeezed a restaurant in the space.  At what point do you realize you've entered one of the best restaurants in the city?  Your first clue is probably the numerous awards in the show window you pass by before reaching the entrance, awards so numerous that they spill over on top of the now useless bar cluttered with awards and bottles.  Inside I found plastic cups over plastic-topped tables and was presented with a single-page menu with options numbered 1 through 20.  Basic?  Yes.  Cheap?  Absolutely.  I asked for recommendations and the pleasant and jubilant waiter (perhaps owner) answered there was a reason why #1 was where it was listed.  So without more than a passing glance at the single piece of paper, I accepted the recommendation, a lunch special combination--panang curry: beef / chicken / pork--and waited briefly for the meal to arrive, taking a moment to admire the homely decor surrounding me.  There was no contractor hired to build these tables or to paint these walls.  The faux fresco was done by someone in dire need to insert more color in an already borderline psychedelic restaurant.  The clientele is a bouillabaisse from every walk of life--business suits with and without ties, middle aged friends discussing their children, a group of hippies being all hip, I do not stand out as brazenly as I had thought or hoped.    For this review, I don't think I'll repeat the common praise of White Elephant.  If it didn't justify its praise, it wouldn't have become the underground hit it has become.  There are many restaurants that no one knows about which close down without a tear shed by the community.  How many businesses have fallen without one throat lump or shuddered phrase of lamentation?  What I'm saying is that a place this hidden would have to earn this praise, so there would be nothing served to reiterate those points.  ...or I'll do it anyway.    It's good.    It's really really good.        Ignore the paltry little garnish parading itself as a salad, enjoy the generous scented rice, and relish in the exquisite offering of curry and daily soup (hot & sour chicken usually).  And to think that plate was only $10.95.  This is a $20 plate anywhere else in town, anywhere else in my home town.  No one is offering this kind of quality anywhere.  No wonder this place is packed every day.    Yes, there is not denying it.  White Elephant Thai Cuisine is not one resting on its laurels--their laurels rest on them (literally).  This would become a weekly outing if I lived in Calgary.  Hell, if I ever do move to Calgary, I would make sure my future home was a reasonable commuting distance to this clandestine treasure.  Food:  4/5 Service:  4/5 Presentation:  4/5 Value:  5/5 Recommendation:  4.25/5"}
{"text":"Love this place - best Thai food in Calgary that I've tried so far.  Spring rolls are so fresh and delicious - green curry, red curry, pad thai... All amazing!  The family beside us had the whole fried fish which looked incredible and they were obviously regulars and were enjoying themselves :).  This is such a tiny hole-in-the-wall; you do not expect this quality of food for such low prices.  I lived in Australia for a few years and they have awesome Thai since there are so many Thai people that immigrate there - but this is VERY comparable to the best I've had there.   Most important:  MAKE A RESERVATION - you WILL be turned away if you do not have one!  Worth the 20min drive into the deep NE for such mouth-watering fair!"}
{"text":"The customer service here wasn't the absolute best. The staff isn't that friendly. During our whole dining experience, none of them checked on us to ensure we were doing okay. We had to constantly flag a server down whenever we needed anything.  We ordered the yellow curry, Tom ka Kai, and basil eggplant with tofu. Each dish was flavorful, however all the vegetables were practically raw. It was as if they cooked the sauce, then threw in the veggies last minute. The onions in particular were too strong that we avoided eating them in all three dishes."}
{"text":"So I live on my own and have for almost 9 years. I love living alone because I can do things that roommates probably wouldn't be too jazzed up about. You know, like listen to the same song 12 times in a row and dance around the house in your underwear. Or, watch totally crappy tv while enjoying a nice dinner of popcorn and wine.  Well, now that I've been to White Elephant, I don't want to live alone anymore. I want to live with whoever cooks the food there. You think I'm kidding but I've told the chef that he can live with me for free as long as he cooks me thai food every day.  Think about this people! I am willing to give up dancing around in my underwear and my slightly embarrassing tv watching habits in order to have this food every single day. If this seems crazy to you, then you simply haven't had their food.  I used to live in Thailand and this food is THE REAL DEAL. I also think it must be laced with something because it I haven't stopped thinking about it since I first had it. It is, by far, the best Thai food I've had in Calgary. The green curry is to die for and the coconut rice is going to transport you straight to heaven.   Yes friends, this place is an oasis in a City with mediocre over priced thai. You even get the authentic asian experience of eating it in a dodgy hotel.   Bottom line - Flights to Thailand are expensive. This place is not and it'll make you feel like you're there. Order extra so you have some to take home."}
{"text":"Spot on Thai food in Calgary.   We thought it was a little awkward that a \"great\" Thai place was only open 3.5 hours a day, and not on Sunday. When we pulled up to the place, we thought it was awkward that you have to walk THROUGH a sketchy hotel lobby to get to the place.   Boy, were we proven wrong!  We ordered green papaya salad, pad see ew, penang curry, garlic chicken, and coconut rice.   With the exception of the garlic chicken, all of the above tasted great! The garlic chicken had good flavor, but it was dry. To be honest, it's really hard to cook small strips of chicken without to drying them out.   Another excellent place recommended by the Yelp community. Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"Myself and two co-workers pulled in here today based on various sites recommending it.  To start off they where not impressed with the look of the hotel, but we went in anyways.  The it looked like without a reservation we where not going to get in, but things work out and we got sat down with a time limit.  They were a little slow getting our order, but once taken the food cam in good time.  We order two appetizers a hot & sour chicken soup that was goon in no time followed by spring rolls. between the three main dishes we had all were very tasty. In the end we enjoyed all the food, and left with full bellies.  It high on my list to get back to in the future."}
{"text":"I must admit I really didn't have high expectations given the location. A hidden Gem for sure. Don't go if you need nice decor or any sort of ambiance.   The food is very well done, lots of flavour, tasty sauces and excellent curry dishes. I would recommend any of the prawn dishes or the cashew chicken.   Definitely would recommend making a reservation! The service was attentive and available when needed.   Went as a group of eight and with a few Thai beers cost was under fifty dollars each.   Cash only!"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food in Calgary, in my opinion. Everything on the menu, if they have it available, is fresh and delicious and authentic. The family cooking in the kitchen is Thai and work hard to cook amazing and gorgeous food.   The papaya salad starter is a must. It's got a blend of flavours - hot, sweet, salt and fresh. I've gone here about 5 times and I've brought people and every one so far has agreed. This place is a hidden gem."}
{"text":"I haven't been able to try an authentic Thai restaurant in while and I must say the food here was fantastic. It was fresh, flavorful and the dishes I had were spiced to perfection. The servers there were helpful and nice and I highly recommend this place if you're in the mood for authentic Asian food. The location throws you off because they're located in a hotel but I think that adds personality to the ambience."}
{"text":"So good. Placed a take out order, red curry and green curry with coconut rice. Everything had amazing flavors. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This place is great. We read the reviews and made sure to arrive 15 minutes before they opened. After being seated, we ordered the panang chicken curry and a soup. It was served within 15 minutes and was indeed the best Thai in the city. For the curry, it was the amount of flavour the dish had. Unreal. The portion size was very large too, definitely left overs. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Waited for 45 mins, but it was overall worth it. The curry and the stir fries are on point. Food was delicious and definitely worth trying out. Location is definitely obscure, but I'd recommend this restaurant. Would have given a higher rating but they ran out of coconut rice.. (in a thai restaurant?)"}
{"text":"Beware- The portions here are huge, so bring a friend to share with.   We shared the vegetarian red curry with pineapples. The curry was thin but very flavorful. They gave a ton of pineapples but I'm pretty sure they were of the canned variety. Coconut rice was simi-sweet and soft without being too sweet.   The service is friendly and the food takes a little long to come, so plan to stay a while and enjoy your food!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Always busy which goes to show that despite the lack of curb appeal - this place is the classic hole in the wall, delicious food sort of place. Aside from the lousy service - this place is great. The food is always good but be cautious when they ask you how spicy you'd like it... 2 is plenty spicy and trust me, I love spicy.   Probably the best Thai food in the city. Would definitely suggest trying it out if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here and great value as well! The only downside is that they do not accept anything other than cash for payment."}
{"text":"This restaurant has good large portions of pretty ok thai food. I do agree it might be one of the better thai restaurants in Calgary (but keep in mind that there aren't many great authentic thai restaurants in this city). They do not take reservations but the waits aren't long for smaller groups. Take out is also a good idea."}
{"text":"Service - one of the worst i experienced so far.  Food - it doesn't matter when the service sucks :)   Waited for 15min for someone to response. and asked to wait for 15min. that's good we can. we are not in hurry. ordered and there is no rice. we have to order rice separately. the waiter guy doesn't say it -we didnt know it.   we ordered more rice and asked if its charged, he said yes it is - and he himself convinced that we dont want the food and took it back. i think that is one of the worst experience anyone can get in a restaurant  on top of that when we complained to the management - he said we are asking too many questions and he ORDERED not to come back :)  owner said he will give 30% discount and he showed the tip jar.   so we are happy by ending a day on a nice note."}
{"text":"Great curries and pad thai. Cashew chicken wasn't available. Helpings were generous. Easily feeds two people per dish. Coconut rice wasn't worth it. Just go steamed rice."}
{"text":"THIS RESTAURANT IS LOCATED INSIDE THE POINT AND FEATHER HOTEL  Whew, now that I've got that one teeny, tiny, handy tidbit about finding this place out of the way,  I must say how glad I am that I got to experience this food in the company of some other yelpers!  I love going out to places like this with larger groups because you are able taste so many different items on the menu, which doesn't work out well when it's dinner for two and you've ordered 6 mains to share. It also helps you to order things you might not necessarily chose on your own.  Having our own lovely vegan in the mix also helped me to get my tofu on. Of everything we shared the stars were the coconut and chicken soup, the eggplant green curry and the pork pad thai. Their coconut rice is also amazing. I don't know how you get coconut rice that good, whenever I make it at home, it smells vaguely like it once had a bath in some coconut body wash a week ago, but never tastes coco-nutty. Not like this.  I wish I could of stayed for dessert, but I was already weighed down by so much coconut milk and had a soccer game to get to. We lost the game but luckily I didn't lose my dinner from the exertion.  My fiancé doesn't even like thai food, but I will be dragging him here cause I need to consume that deliciousness again.   There is more than peanuts to this place! Plus a really creepy elephant marionette doll that your head can bash into."}
{"text":"This was some of the best Thai food I have ever had.  The vegetables were fresh and cooked the right amount of time, the chicken was not overdone and rubbery.  The Thai iced tea had a lot of sugar in it, but was actual tea, not powder.  The place is in the breakfast area of the Best Western.  The service was just ok, not great.  It was no big deal for me because I was watching the baseball game anyway.  If you are not in a rush this place has great food."}
