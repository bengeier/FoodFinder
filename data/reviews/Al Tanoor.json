{"text":"My dad took me here on Friday and told me it was amazing. He loves trying all different kinds of food so I was excited to try this. It blew me away. The flavours are unbelievable. The samoon bread is something I had never tried before and I'd never want a shawarma without it ever again. It's so soft and light, but they put the whole shawarma in a grill press at the end so the outside is crunchy. I loved it so much that I came back on Sunday with my boyfriend and his sister. They were both highly impressed and can't stop talking about it. My only problem with this place is that it's so far from my home!! Please open a west end location :)  Update: just went here again (August 2017) and it was just as amazing as ever. Just go here!!"}
{"text":"Great food, very friendly service. The restaurant is clean and the homemade bread is great. I tried the beef shawarma sandwich and it was delicious, and the shish tawook was fantastic. The sauces they provide are great. I just wish the salad had a little more lemon/garlic dressing."}
{"text":"The family at Al Tanoor knows what they're doing.   The falafel is probably my favourite in the city right now. Make sure you get it with the amba sauce. You can also have it on a samoon bread which is made in house. I think it's $4 for a falafel sandwich.   BTW, Iraqis are loud-talkers so don't think they're yelling at you (or each other). That's just the way they speak. And be careful with the hot sauce.  A couple of the sauces they put on the sandwich are yoghurt-based so make sure you ask about that if you're vegan or allergic."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh food; generous portions; very inexpensive. I had chicken shawarma on an in-house-made bread pocket (don't remember the name of the bread), and it is definitely in my top 5 shawarma experiences. The chicken was well-seasoned and juicy, veg was all crispy and their garlic sauce is not overpowering. That pocket, however, is what gave this one an edge over other places for me. Will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Food portions here are great. I didn't expect the chicken shawarma on a pita to be so stuffed full for just $3.99. They also have the option of making the shawarma on home made bread, which I will probably be back to try the next time I visit. I also ordered a shish-tawook plate for dinner, which was decently sized for $7.99. This place can be a bit slow to put your order together but luckily there is a tv to entertain you while waiting at the front. I only wish that they had french fries the day I visited so I could have substituted my rice with them and that they had cups so I could get water rather than being stuck with purchasing a canned or bottled drink. Overall, this is a place that I will probably visit again."}
{"text":"Very good Shawarma on  freshly baked Iraqi Bread.  Much better than Pita. Used to go to Ibrahim Shawarma before but found this place much better. Good clean place and nice people.  Bought two extra bread for $1.25.  Will try other dishes soon."}
{"text":"Their homemade bread for the shawarma is the main reason why you should go here. The staff is good. Aside from the old man who's a little lost when it comes to handling lots of orders, fast. This place gets busy fast. The grilled chicken shawarma sets this place apart from your normal rotisserie shawarma joints. It's like a bbq chicken shawarma. Hopefully this gets your attention. Best $6 I've ever spent on a shawarma :)"}
{"text":"Excellent shawerma. .beef tastes amazing. Huge portion. Home made Iraqi bread.  Must try. Kebab is great,  friendly service."}
{"text":"Went back again, just as good as it was first time. They prepare the food fresh so the prep time is longer than some might expect (5-10 mins tops).   Friendly service, great food. On my list of favourites now.   It's now clearly the best falafel I have had in town, but get the Iraqi home made bread. It's diamond shaped - far better than pita bread.   Bonus: The veggie Falafel seemed overly inexpensive at 3.99 but it's lunch-sized and nicely balanced. Great value!"}
{"text":"Clean, inexpensive and delicious. Only $2.99 for a chicken shawarma that was pretty filling. I'll return for sure."}
{"text":"Shawarma is amazing on their homemade bread. The owners really care about making each customer happy. Often he will carefully look at the meat to make sure it's good quality.    Watch out for the hot sauce it's really spicy. The owner really has a big heart.  I asked him to buy a drink the other day and he gave it to me for free!"}
{"text":"This gem in the suburbs offers home cooked meals with delightful marinated spiced meats accompanied by fresh vegetables.   We descended on this eatery well past the lunch hour so it was mostly empty and the kindly server (guessing daughter of the owner/cook) walked us through our meal options ever so patiently.   I had the lamb plate (under CAD$11) and chose briyani rice to go with two juicy and tasty lamb sausages. I asked for 'everything' on the side -- hummus, chili paste (definitely had a kick to it), various slices of tomatoes, cucumbers, pickled beets, lettuce and chopped parsley and a magic dollop of garlic which I went back for seconds.   Our server chimed that her dad made the garlic paste fresh and had no idea what went into making it. Whatever sorcery that went into the garlic mousse -- the combination of light, creamy and pungent -- was definitely worth guarding.   This was not a small lunch. I shared it with my 8 year old and still had leftovers to take home.  My other kids chose the shawarma with the marinated chicken and beef. Our lady server recommended it on their homemade pita (ok, it is like a pita but she called it something else) The hubby chose the falafel also nestled in crisp vegetables and tangy condiments in the pita.  There were satisfied hums all around.   Seating Not a lot of space. Appears to cater to the workers with limited time and little interest to socialize.  There is a counter that seats about 8, 3 dinner tables with accompanying chairs. Folks who came in whilst we were there ordered and then hurried off with their bundles of deliciousness under their arms. So, not a romantic first date sort of place.   Servings are all huge (but I'm told I eat like a bird) Ingredient freshness in this locale appear to be highly valued.  If you like Mediterranean and spicy Indian foods, Iraqi foods appear to be a marriage of both flavors.   Let's hope they'll still be here when we return to Canada."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat on a weekday.. nothing really was open at 10:30 and we didn't want to do a sit down dinner, so what was open? Al Tanoor!  I've been to Joshi food to shop but never ventured in here. It wasn't busy when we went around 10pm but their shawarmas are $3.99 each and they are not made in the typical pita bread.. it's a flat almond shape bread.  The shawarma is put on a grill like usual.   WOW, it was divine! The bread was crispy and delicious and the fillings were so good! They also have this red chili paste that they put with garlic and hummus - definitely recommend!!   $4 for a shawarma and that too a filling one? Score!!"}
{"text":"This place was very very basic! the food was nothing special. The Shawarma was actually a little dry. The place was also empty when we came in. Their iraqi bread is awesome though! I gave 3 stars for the bread alone! we came here twice while we were visiting, once for the shawarma which we really were not impressed with, and the next was to get some iraqi bread. overall its an ok place, ive had wayyyyyyy better shawarma though."}
{"text":"Best sharwama in town, stuffed, juicy and flavorful. Home made bread is the must pick.  The only drawback is that preparation can be a bit slow, but hey, great food worthes the wait!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken shawarma + hot sauce and super nice owner who took extra care with my order! Will definitely be back and look forward to it...Nasib (owner) rocks! Thank you for the best shawarma outside of new York and great service!"}
{"text":"The shawarma here is great. Both the beef and the chicken. They generally have great service, and the price is right. Use to come here few times a week when it was cheaper though."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best shawarma in Toronto. From the homemade bread to fresh ingredients and warming service. 10/10"}
{"text":"Went in for the reviews and was not surprised by my experience here. The service was aces, extremely friendly and welcoming for a first time visitor.   I got a plated meal and the rice was flavorful, the salad tasted fresh and the meat, oh the meat was too good. The sawwwwwces on top were just something from a triple d segment. The homemade bread on top? Would go back for that goddamn bread alone.  Next time I will definitely try a shwarma on the house-baked bread.   My only gripe is that I don't live in Scarborough."}
{"text":"The food is amazing amd the staff are really friendly and generous  I strongly recommend it cuz weather you're used to middle eastern food or you're looking for a new exotic taste Filling proportions & very reasonable prices"}
{"text":"The prices have gone up, so I've had to rate this as a 3/5. The shawarma is good, comes with a good quantity of meat, and decent toppings. I'm a great fan of their hot sauce/spread. It's a good place for some variation from going to shawarma empire, especially if you decide to get your shawarma on their house bread."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place is their flavor packed sauces. The provide a good portion, but the cooking of the meat is not consistent. They can burn it badly or cook it dry if not properly advised. If they can take the cooking seriously, they will become one of the best in Toronto with the help of their outstanding sauces, till then they are simply OK."}
{"text":"I feel I should've tried the bread or falafel after reading the reviews but instead I had the chicken shawarma plate.   First of all it's a small place with one table for 4 and one for 2, plus barstool and counter style seating. Fortunately we did get a seat but even for late afternoon on Sunday the table for 4 was taken and many were through for takeout.   The plate is just under $11 which is not unreasonable but not cheap. The portions are big though and there's a number of sauces and garnishes.   My favourite part was the rice. It was so flavourful and unfortunately my least favourite was the chicken. It was not only on the dry side but too hard and crunchy in parts. There was so much I didn't even come close to finishing.   The only part of the experience that bothered me was the cashier told us to pay after we ate. At the time it seemed like a nice gesture but when we finished eating 2 people were in line to order food and we had to wait in line to pay. And it took a long time!   I would go back to try something else. The staff were nice and obviously cared about the food and its presentation and were polite. I would probably just insist on paying upfront next time so I could leave when I'm done eating"}
{"text":"Best shawarma in town! I never liked falafel until I had one handmade by rose herself! I go 20 mins out of my way passing 5 shawarma shops just to go see them! The bread is everything!!"}
{"text":"I come to this place at least 2 times a week because I love the Shawarma on the home made bread. Always pretty good and for a good price  I don't always write reviews, but after having the same issues repeatedly I felt compelled to make my voice. Unfortunately I can't give this place 4+ stars because of the customer service of one of the employees. Let me clarify that I've been served by 3 different people, a young Man, a lady, and an older Man. The young Man and the lady I always look forward to, but UNFORTUNATELY they seem to be working less than previously. The older Man, who I now see more often, is the one I have concerns with.   The older Man consistently forgets my order as he's making them, usually because he's too busy speaking with people, whether its the back employees or other people at the place who speak his native language. Even though my order is always simple and the same thing (I frequent this place VERY often), everything with no hot spice, I have to remind him time and time again that he misses things such as sauces, or veggies, and its extremely frustrating. I can understand being busy or having to multitask, but it's straight disrespectful to be talking to others and having your customer hassled to repeat themselves multiple times because you're too preoccupied. Definitely his customer service is lacking.   Otherwise, I definitely enjoy the place and Will continue to go as long as they consistently keep up the quality, but if there aren't any improvements I wouldn't suggest this place to my friends."}
{"text":"The quality of this place has gone down the drain significantly. I have been there 3 times over the last few months. The old man, I think the owner doesn't pay attention when taking order and when you correct him, he gets annoyed and has an angry face. His stuff seem they have had enough in the restaurant business and no longer interested. They warmed left over old rice in the microwave from the night before and put that in our rice platter order. In general save your money and get fresh shawarma platters else where."}
{"text":"Good food at a very low price. I got a falafel and a side of humus. The falafel was on their home made bread, which was delicious. I wish they gave me that for the humus dip (instead of a normal pita). The humus was plentiful and good, but nothing to go crazy for.   The food ended up being basically a meal and a half and was around $8 ($4.50 for falafel and $2 for humus). I was shocked at how cheap it was.   If there's one complaint it's the wait. I waited for about 15 minutes when there weren't that many customers. However, it was only one lady preparing everything and she was going as quickly as possible. She was also very nice, so it made the wait feel not as long.   Will definitely come back to conquer the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Only go here if you feel like waiting for 15 minutes for them to even start making your food.   They might get your food ready faster if the last 5 times I've gone there weren't more friends/workers hanging out chatting rather than working or taking deliveries through the front of the store.  Credit where credit is due, the food is good its just everything else I don't like."}
{"text":"I really really like this place. The food is amazing and fresh. The bread is home-made and you can tell right away. The people working behind the counter speak great English and are extremely friendly as well. You can tell they clean and take care of the place (first sign, they wear gloves when making orders).  The pricing is very good too in comparison to the surrounding stores. I am now going to go here for all my shawarma needs in Toronto.  Updated: Their prices have gone up. So my review goes down."}
{"text":"Awesome food, restaurant is run my Iraqi family. Restaurant is clean and food is in expensive.  Beef and chicken shawarmas are $3.99 each or 2 for $6.99.  They gave us free dolmah and baklavah, so nice of them.  Going back soon."}
{"text":"One of the best shawarma places in Toronto hands down. They have some really tasty sauces and some very delicious homemade bread. All the ingredients are fresh and the meat has great flavour. Staff is really friendly."}
{"text":"The food is is mediocre at best. One time I was served rice that was heated up from the microwave. The old man's service is the worst.   Also, this old man acts like the parking lot is HIS. Very rude and disrespectful. Even muttering racist comments under his breathe."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Just a block east of Ibrahim's Sharawma and just as good (if not better). You have to order whatever sandwich with the house bread. Its amazing. Hard to describe but basically when they toast it, its kind of like a donair (like the turkish ones you get in Germany).   Ordered the beef sandwich. Beef was juicy and flavourful. The hot sauce is interesting too and sufficiently spicy.  This is a mom and pop place, and unlike the pita bread option, the house made bread is done in the back by the mom. Place is nice and clean and they are nice people. Cheap too! though the sandwich isn't huge. Just get 2!  I will definitely go back when i'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wow !!! I came here with a couple of my friends to get lunch. I heard really good things about al tanoor so I decided to order the chicken and beef mixed shawarma which sounded odd to me at first. I absolutely loved it! I'm not one to like shawarma because of the very thin pita and sauce that leaks out everywhere and the messiness of eating it. But this pita is made in store, and is completely unique ! I couldn't get enough of it. If the store was closer to home I would have one every day .   Definitely recommend eating here."}
{"text":"I have never felt so insulted and disgusted to see this owner use such unreasonable behaviour inside another restaurant establishment just because I parked in front of this store for a couple minutes to order takeout food. He literally charged in towards the employees and started yelling about \"his\" parking spot being taken in Makkalchon during a full house with people also waiting outside to get seats. I confronted this man to try and calm him down, but he refused to listen and started yelling inside the restaurant. I even let him know I was only buying takeout, so that I will be leaving soon, but he said he didn't care and that he will call the cops. I honestly think this type of behaviour was unnecessary and that the owner shouldn't have tried to ruin another establishment when his wasn't doing well. Definitely not the best way to communicate your problems by yelling at the employees."}
{"text":"Already well reviewed. I can't stress how good the fallafel is here. My wife and I get the sandwich with all the fixings with a bit of hot sauce. So good! Always good service, homemade bread and great value."}
{"text":"Super portion size, everything was delicious.  Mostly a take-out place.  Price was a little steep, but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Can't believe it has taken me so long to write a review for Al-Tanoor, when my husband and I order food every Friday night. We always get the Shish Taouk plate with Kefta Kebob on the side. We don't eat rice, so the owner always makes the best custom salads for us! It's our FAV takeout place by far!!"}
{"text":"Fresh, friendly, great prices! No bland falafel here.  Flavourful and hot.  Also one of the best beef shawarma places I've had in Toronto.  The family who runs this restaurant put a lot of love and care into their food.  No credit cards but worth going to find an atm."}
{"text":"Looking for the best shawarma in Toronto? I never use the word best by the way.......Order beef shawarma on homemade pita with everything::::::OUTSTANDING!!!!  Forget that its inexpensive.....its worth way more!"}
