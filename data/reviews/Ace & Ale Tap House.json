{"text":"Best Hungarian food in Toronto  Huge surprise - walked in on a Tuesday evening (had a Groupon).  Place was totally empty.  However the Hungarian food was the best!  I have tried Hungarian at a few places in Toronto over the years (in the Annex, in Richmond Hill) and was always unimpressed - bland and non-descript.  Not here though.  We ordered four dishes and all four were well-cooked, nicely spiced - very tasty and authentic.  Completely unexpected, but will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through a friend, who had found out through a customer she was helping at work. It's a new place so I was really excited to try it out.  We dropped in around 5, and the place was empty. I wanted to start off with a beer and my friend was going to have a cup of tea, until we found out they didn't have any... =/ It kind of caught me by surprise, as I thought that tea was one of those things you could get anywhere, but maybe I'm wrong about that one.   Was a little disappointed with the alcohol selection in general. They had a couple of fairly common choices available. I was hoping for something a bit different, but maybe that's just the craft beer snob in me that's talking.   For food, we ordered the langos apps to much on. I'd never had this dish before, but my friend had said that she had definitely had better versions of that dish.  Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed with the experience but I'd want to come back in a few months to see if they'd been able to make some changes. We'll see!"}
{"text":"Authentic Hungarian kitchen with reasonable prices. Only place in Toronto that I've found a decent chicken paprikash. Schnitzel will be next on the menu to try. Cabbage roles sounded great, too.  Don't be fooled by the name- they should be promoting the delicious Hungarian food (major differentiator) instead of the ale /tap house generality.  The service was awesome (owner operated) and I'm sure I'll be back soon- hopefully people discover this place!"}
{"text":"Great food! Had a small issue with our order and could not have been more impressed with how the staff handled it. Both the waitress and the chef apologized profusely. It is refreshing to see such excellent customer service. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"To be honest we never even realized this was a restaurant.  It was Saturday night, we were bar hopping and happened upon this secret gem of a place.  The Bartender/DJ named Cosmo was just awesome he went above and beyond. I will definitely become a regular at this place especially whenever Cosmo is spinning classic house tunes."}
{"text":"\"What's Hungarian food?\"  That was basically my mindset coming into this restaurant.  My friend and I had a Groupon so we ordered Schnitzel, Breaded Mushrooms, Hortobagyu Style Crepes with chicken paprikash stuffing, Beef Goulash, and Ants Climbing on a Tree.  In a very quick summary, I would just like to say that none of the food was amazing. Nothing special, nothing that made me think \"wow, so THIS is what Hungarian food is\", and I would definitely not come here again (as the food was actually pretty expensive without the Groupon!!)   If I had to pick, the breaded mushrooms was probably the best tasting, which is kind of sad. The schnitzel was rather dry and thin, the crepe, which I assumed to be delicious since it was presented so nicely, was bland and soggy. The beef goulash was alright, but it's just soup. The worst of the dishes was Ants Climbing on a Tree. With a discouraging name like that, you'd think the dish must be delicious to compensate.. nope! The meat/vermicelli were super salty and the rice was hard and oily.  Though the employee was nice, we were the only ones in the restaurant for our entire duration there and the food took FOREVER! Not very good service, it seems."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon deal for this place so my boyfriend and I decided to check this place out yesterday.   This place is completely RANDOM.   We walked in and it looked dead. There was no server to greet us so the cook in the back told us to sit anywhere. We noticed there was only 1 cook in the back and 1 server that served us 10 minutes later.   The menu was a little bit confusing as one side of the menu had traditional Hungarian dishes (beef goulash, chicken paprikash, cabbage rolls etc) and then the other side had Chinese food, fried osyters, mussels and fries? Hmmm..  We ordered the beef goulash with dumplings, schitzel with mashed potatoes and cucumber salad and the pierogies.   Guess how long we waited for our food? 45 MINUTES! When we finally got our food, it was warm not hot. The food was actually really good but not something worth going back for.   I also noticed they had a Jukebox mounted on their wall that played music samples from Annie Lennox to Britney Spears.   The random menu, music and horrible service definitely threw us off. Overall, we didn't have a good experience from this place."}
{"text":"This place used to be some dive bar.  But it's been renovated and looks ok now.  It was pretty empty when we went.  Probably because it's not really located in a great intersection.  We got to sit at the front window which was the brightest part of the bar.  The other areas seemed a bit dark.    The food though was ok.  The sauces were tasty.  The food was served to us pretty quickly and it looked pretty good.  We had an online deal coupon which allowed us to both order 2 meals and an appetizer and a beer.  It was a lot of food and we ended up taking food home.    The server was really nice and give us her opinion as to her favourites.  The crepe was probably my favourite out of three dishes we ordered (see pictures).  However, nothing amazing about this place that would make us go back there.  Even with another coupon deal.  Good to try as I never really had hungarian food before."}
{"text":"food was decent but dumpings (that came with the chicken) were bland ... only one server on a Saturday night...lango was a bit too greasy...  looks like the new look didnt get rid of the old clientele (old, blue collar workers)...washrooms were dirty...most likely since there was one person on the floor...  suggestions: make some improvements to the food....change the music to drive away the old clients (no juke box)...and hire more staff to keep the service fast and washrooms clean"}
{"text":"The name is a bit baffling as there isn't a heck of a lot of ale happening, but you don't come here for the ale** or the atmosphere*, you come for the glorious food***. What you wouldn't know from the sign is this joint offers traditional Hungarian meals - beef goulash, chicken paprikash, schnitzel, cabbage rolls - you know, the super light dishes - and they are DELICIOUS. Okay so the dumplings could use a bit of salt and maybe a pinch of dill, but everything else was a party for your mouth.   *One big disconnect for me was the \"ale\", maybe I'm crazy but I was expecting a selection of European ales and was totally bummed out to find four local (and kind of ho-hum) selections.  **It is also worth mentioning that the place used to be a rather \"colorful\" local bar named Michael's and though the place has undergone a significant makeover some of the old regulars can be found haunting the 90's style wall Jukebox. This makes for an interesting ambiance - part dive bar, part family restaurant with a pinch of strip mall pub - and an eclectic soundtrack (remember there is a Jukebox...A JUKEBOX?!?).  ***If you're agoraphobic, a beer snob or not into Jukeboxes it's worth mentioning this place delivers via Orderit. I mean I don't know about you, but I can't think of anything more beautiful than enjoying some authentic Hungarian cuisine in my pajamas with some pilsners I picked up from the LiC-BO. Just sayin'..."}
{"text":"Far from impressed.  We went on a Friday night around 9-10(I had a groupon) and even though the place was only half full, there was a DJ drowning people with his music.  It was a bit weird to have a DJ playing so early and so loud in a place that wasn't packed. It just made the place less inviting.  Nevertheless, our server was awesome but it was clear that she was overwhelmed. Not exactly sure why she was the only one manning the bar AND the floor.  We got 2 schnitzel plates (15 bucks each) and langos (9 bucks) to start with. The schnitzel was a generous portion of meat and it was enjoyable. As for the \"parisienne potatoes\" accompanying it, not so much. Literally 5 tiny UNSEASONED potatoes that were baked/boiled and plopped onto the plate.   As for the langos, waste of money. It was a \"Golden fried pastry\". Supposedly an appetizer, 2 discs of fried dough topped with sour cream and shredded mozzarella. The fried dough had pockets of oil in it, drenched from the oil they fried it in. Since it's an appetizer, they should've considered making smaller portions and more of it, that way the dough wouldn't just absorb all the oil.  I paid in total 12 bucks ($12 for $20 worth of food) plus another 30 bucks (including tip). I can't imagine how pissed I would've been if I hadn't had the groupon and paid 50 bucks. Such a shame as the location is great and the interior is far much better than the last business that was there."}
{"text":"I had purchased a voucher for this place a while back and the first time I attempted to use it, the place was closed because of some electrical issue. My dining companion and I returned a few months later and were immediately seated in a booth at the back.  Okay, first and foremost, the service here is *terrible*. We were sitting for a good ten minutes before we were given menus and asked for a drink order, and it took another several minutes for me to get my drink. (My dining companion didn't even receive her order.)  We decided to start with the Hungarian Stuffed Pepper, which I will admit was very tasty. The sauce was rich and spicy, and the filling was quite delicious.  But the good vibes didn't last long, sadly. The entrees arrived and they were both extremely disappointing (to put it mildly). I ordered the Chicken Paprikash, which is described thusly on the menu: \"tender chicken pieces in a creamy Hungarian paprika sauce served on traditional dumplings.\" The one positive note was the dumplings, which were soft and tasty. But the sauce was completely bland. I didn't detect an ounce of flavor or spice. And the chicken was absolutely not \"chicken pieces\" but instead full, bone-in pieces of chicken. I wouldn't have ordered this had I known that was the case.  My dining companion fared much, much worse. She ordered the Stiry Fry with Roshti, which is described like so: \"your choice of pork, chicken or shrimp, fresh veggies and roshti.\" While she enjoyed the roshti, she didn't enjoy the dish itself at all. The sauce was oddly sweet and the ingredients contained within were nothing short of inexplicable. There were blueberries in there! Needless to say she didn't finish her food.  After more waiting and finally walking up to the waitress to get the bill, we finally paid and got the hell out of there. I will never return.  (Oh, and for a place with the word \"ale\" in its name, Ace & Ale Tap House has an absolutely pathetic beer list.)"}
{"text":"Really a gem in the rough...  They have great authentic Hungarian food and it's located in the middle of it all! Queen west!  This nice & cozy restaurant turns into a chique looking lounge by night where they have several DJ's spinning on different nights.  The drinks are moderately priced hence this a perfect place to come party if you don't want to spend a lot money and still have a great time!!  Anna (the chef) & Fred (the owner) are some of the nicest people you will ever meet! Always smiling & ready to please!  Gotta check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"We had supper this evening at the Ace & Alehouse (Queen W/Bathurst).  Until a few months ago, it was a seedy bar called Michael's.  We'd only been in Michael's once ... they've cleaned it up a lot.  When you walk it, it seems more like a pub, especially with its name.  They serve just four drafts on tap so it's a bit of an overstatement of them to call themselves a \"taphouse\".  Surprisingly the menu is Hungarian food.  Gord ordered the Chicken Parprikash.  Neither of us had had it before.  I tried some and it was good ... Gord liked it too.  There was a nice bit to the sauce on the chicken.  The dumplings could have been hotter, though.  I'd had a big lunch so wasn't too hungry so ordered medium wings.  They were good but I'd get hot next time.  The sauce was nice but there was no kick.  There was supposed to be dill dip (I like dill dip) but they have replaced it with julienne cucumbers.  I don't like cucumbers so Gord ate some of them.  I'll go back with a bigger appetite next time and will order the Chicken Parprikash.  Elaine was our server.  She was friendly and took good care of us."}
{"text":"My first time but fairly good food just needed a little bit of seasoning. but over all good to my taste bud's. I had 3  mains so a good over all review of the food and it's quality & if you were a chef or had any knowledge of the kitchen and food, you would know that food was prepared by a mother. Love mums coming and that's great soul food."}
