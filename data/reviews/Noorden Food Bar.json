{"text":"Very interesting choice of Dutch tapas with an Indonesian twist. Had scotch eggs, white cabbage, bitterballen and hanger steak, none of which did disappoint. Also amazing gin selection!!"}
{"text":"Two of us walked in around 7:30 Thursday night without reservation, were told we had to sit at the bar or outside on a cool night because all tables were \"booked\". Yet we sat at the bar for our entire dinner while the restaurant remained at about 20% capacity the whole time. Who are you kidding? Food was fine, really nothing great, decent neighborhood place (would be more worthwhile at a table). If you insist we sit at the bar, then bartender, please take your cell phone off of your cutting board. Basic food hygiene. However staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and I've been to Noorden at least four times hoping it's going to get better. To be honest there are not many cocktail bars in the area and I have to admit Noorden looks appealing. However, I honestly think they could use a better bartender. My friends and I went last Saturday expecting to see someone different behind the bar, but we turned around when we saw the same guy as usual. At the beginning I thought he was shy, but the truth is that he doesn't care about customer service. If you work in the hospitality industry you have to be a people person (if you don't enjoy talking to others, at least smile...). Otherwise, you're in the wrong industry. I'm not spending more time or money at this place."}
{"text":"The decor is great, the staff are friendly and accomodating, and the atmosphere is fun/eclectic. Definitely a nice adition to the neighborhood, I just hope locals discover it before it vanishes due to low customer traffic!!"}
{"text":"This was my least favorite food experience in a long time. Food was average at best and service needs less abrump responses. Will not return."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good 
-service (very friendly and efficient server)
-ambiance (nice restaurant with lots of space for a big group)

The bad 
-very small portions of food 
-over priced relative to the portion size 
-hit or miss with certain dishes. Flank steak is delicious. The noodle dish and the $7.00 appetizer consisting of a half a bag of miss Vicky's potato chips was ridiculous"}
{"text":"The Yelp reviews do not give this place the credit it deserves.  There is a lot of unique food on this menu that you will not find ANYWHERE else.  This is modern Dutch food... if you don't love it, at least you will leave having had a unique dining experience.

Their drink menu is very interesting, clearly focused on gin.  I had the HLM 692 just because I'd never heard of half the ingredients.  Yum.  We also tried the a couple of the \"not your mama's\" gin and tonics #3 and #5.  All really tasty.

Fortunately I was there with a large enough group to try lots of different food dishes. We also had a vegetarian who left very happy and very full.  The highlights of the meal were the bitterballen (think chicken hush puppy), cheese and pickles, roasted carrots and then the real standouts - war fries, stampot (mashed potato and bacon elevated) and one of the best and most interesting beef tartars I have had.  Of course we ended with some Olie Bollen (kind of Dutch donut holes).  We really did not have a bad dish and I think we ordered 12 or 13 courses.  I would love to go back soon to try the rest, and revisit a few favorites too."}
{"text":"Noorden offers modern Dutch food in a rustic, hipster setting. It was my first time trying Dutch cuisine in Toronto. The menu is not very extensive and because the food (primarily tapas-style) is meant to be shared, most of the dishes come in very small portions.

I ordered one of their Amsterdam Brewery beers on rotating tap (can't recall the name!). For our large group, we shared a bunch of appetizers - bitterballen, lamb satay skewers, fried spice gouda, crispy deviled eggs, and war fries. The war fries were definitely the highlight!

For our \"mains\" I shared the beef tartar, roasted duck leg, and grilled flank steak. The beef tartar comes with some crispy chips - nothing to write home about. The duck leg was small and frankly a little underwhelming. I personally don't think this dish is worth the price tag. The flank steak was just okay. I enjoyed the marinated black kale that it is served with.

Definitely an \"A-OK\" restaurant which is why I gave Noorden 3 stars."}
{"text":"We decided to grab a bite to eat around 8:15pm on a Monday. We decided on Noorden and there were many customers when we arrived. Once seated I noticed a waiter was clearly annoyed and, quite obviously, looked at his watch. We felt uncomfortable and awkward. Our waiter arrived and was pleasant enough, however he proceeded to tell us that the kitchen closed at 8:45 pm, there is time but we need to make it fast and get our order in. At this point we should have left. I understand if we arrived at 8:45, but we didn't. This is the service business, and if a customer is there to eat, make that happen.As it turns out, we were completely rushed, and the waiter forgot to order the one thing we were there for. Ironically, when we left there were still other customers there drinking. As for the food, we felt so badly being there that we really didn't notice the food, just rushed eating not cause a headache for anyone. I just saw that they will be closing soon, so our experience makes more sense now - they just didn't care. Bottom line -Don't waste your time, there are many amazing restaurants in Toronto and they are more than happy to service their hungry customers."}
{"text":"Went here with my fellow foodie girlfriend having discovered it has the same owners as Little Sister which we both loved.  Despite there being just the two of us, it didn't stop us from ordering almost everything on the menu. Notables include the Scottish egg and war fries, their two most popular favourites."}
{"text":"I loved Quince bistro, and was never disappointed each time I went. So when owners decided to replace Quince with Noorden, I just had to come give it a try. 

It's been awhile since I had food that tickle my tastebuds. But noorden had done it. And there was no disappointment! 

Fusion beef tartare with shallots served with Asian  shrimp chips. Genius. 

Scotch eggs was done well. A bit more seasoning may be good. 

Flank steak was on point! Even the cabbage underneath is full of flavor and texture. I love the spice that was in this. Delicious! 

I will return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Does anyone really go back to this place for a second helping of overpriced 'meh'?  The flank steak was about as tough as chewing a piece of dog rawhide must be.  War fries?  I thought I was eating stinky old socks.  The worst thing on the menu bar none!  So this is a Dutch restaurant?  I asked the waitress if, being Dutch, they had actual frite sauce (dutch french fry mayo) and she had no idea what I was talking about.  That was my first clue that this place was gonna be a ton of BS.  If you ignore my warning and do decide to come here nevertheless, at least do everything in your power to avoid the bald-headed waiter with the beard who is about as friendly as an ISIS executioner.  To describe the portions as being small is to do a disservice to the meaning of the word.  Note to Owners:  Grown men like to eat. So again I must ask.  Does anyone actually return to this place after inadvertently being fooled into finding themselves here a first time?  Save your money and your palate and go somewhere else in the neighbourhood.  Why they closed Quince and replaced it with this piece of crap sure beats the hell out of me.  If I could give this place no stars instead of the mandatory entry-level 'one' on this website, I would do so gladly. One last question.  Translated into English, does 'Noorden' mean 'Piece of crap waste of money'?"}
{"text":"Noorden is brought to you by the people that brought you \"Little Sister\".  Noorden has a casual, industrial hipster vibe. Noorden is a modern Dutch food bar with Indonesian flavours. The bar offers a variety of house cocktails that are very good. It's a great place for a night out.

The dishes are small and sharable. The textures and flavours are unique and fun. The contrasting textures and pairing of different flavours are memorable. You would not be able to find dishes quite like this anywhere else. If you are on a date and need something to talk about, the unique dishes may provide you with something to talk about. 

The service is attentive. If you need recommendations on what to order, the wait staff is always willing to assist. 

If you are adventurous, I would recommend Noorden. It is an unique restaurant in the Toronto restaurant tapestry."}
{"text":"Half price wine bottles Sunday and Monday?!! Yesss please. Great ambiance and service. Very cozy spot in the winter and summer they open up the windows.  Food is delish. I just wish they had a cpl more app options"}
{"text":"Place was nice. Worst food experience ever! We had few appetizers and none was good. Then we got Ribs, glass noodle, and steaks all 3 was supper spicy and so bad so couldn't even eat them. Then we asked our waitress if they have anything not spicy and answer was not really. We were wondering why when they took our order they didn't even mention our food is going to be this spicy so they told us everything is already pre marinated in Indonesian spice! And we learn history which Indonesia was under Dutch colony! Instead of them finding way to please us they were teaching history lessons! Maybe they should add a page to their menu to give ppl heads up! They only had like 10 food options and all bad! We ended up ordering 3 fries to eat for dinner and paid $250 for 4"}
{"text":"We've been a couple of times now. The menu is unique and fun. We're regulars at Little Sister - the sister restaurant on the opposite side of Yonge so we were comfortable with the menu. The food quality is great. It is tapas style so you'll need to order quite a few plates. The staff is helpful recommending dishes. War fries are a must! Just leave your guilt at home or work out before dinner. The charred squash carpaccio is different but really enjoyable - it's light. Love the roasted carrots. We kept ordering the crispy wontons - we couldn't get enough of them. It's not a big place so service is efficient. Absolutely recommend trying."}
{"text":"Noorden offers an appealing food experience and excellent drinks.

Ten of us planned on the rijstaffel, the Indonesian rice-table feast for a friend's birthday. It was a surprise and a pleasure to learn that the restaurant also has Toronto's largest gin selection and makes it's own tonic. At least three of our part were gin drinkers and sampled a variety of the gins available. I enjoyed a local cider which was very crisp and not too sweet. It was a perfect accompaniment to the rijstaffel.

White and spiced rice was laid out, followed by two appetizers, then 8 dishes of beef, chicken, fish, pork and vegetables. Heavy on the coconut and the curry, everything was delicious, although my favorite was the coconut curry green beans (and if anyone who knows me reads that, they'll laugh as curry and green beans are not my favorite things.)

Dessert came and we enjoyed mint tea as a digestif. It was a magnificent feast and a lovely evening with friends, new and old."}
{"text":"Long overdue review, went for a media event with a friend.. got to try some drinks and dishes. Some notables were the butterballer and chicken liver toast dishes. These might be different menu items from what will be available now though.

If you aren't digging the menu, I do recommend going for their drinks. The bartender, Mac, is super friendly and creative with drinks. Willing to whip up any drink for you."}
{"text":"Bitterballen in Toronto?  My prayers have been answered.  I'm a long time Netherlands aficionado and it's great to have such a nice pub to get bitterballen and other delicious Dutch bar food.  The war fries (patatje oorlog) were delicious and a great presentation.  The server was an Australian guy and super friendly.  Fantastic service, reasonably priced beer and amazing Dutch food.  What more could I ask for?  A well deserved five stars."}
{"text":"The staff were nice, friendly and attentive, and the space was clean and well kept.

The food was disappointing.  for the amount they charge, the portions are unforgivably small.  We paid $7 for a skillet of broccoli that was barely larger than a CD, and didn't have much broccoli among the filler.

I paid $17 for a steak dish, and while i understood the portions were small, it was actually an even SMALLER piece of meat cut into long diagonal slices spread out to look.... less small.  The meat was under cooked to the point I was chewing it excessively and almost choking trying to swallow it.  I asked for them to cook it a little more, and when they returned, the meat wasn't even warm... making me think they just re-served me the same piece without cooking it at all.  I left almost half of it on the plate, a waste of money.

My date ordered red wine, and the (average sized) glass was 35% full  Maybe 4oz for $13.  Insulting considering their competition in the area.

The chicken balls contained less actual chicken than the chicken balls at the MANDARIN... and we all know that's not much.  Furthermore, the pair of 'Bitterballen' you get are smaller than golf balls, and the filling is mashed to the point that you have no idea if there is even chicken inside, or some mushy pot-pie filling.

In retrospect, I wonder if the staff deceptively over-hyped the dishes when we were questioning them about the menu.

Overall, I felt pretty ripped off and insulted... the portions were unforgivably small for the price, and the quality of the food is not on par with the rest of this area.  All I can think of is how much I could have gotten spending the same amount at almost any other restaurant in the neighbourhood.

I will be surprised if interest in this venue persists more than a few months... I predict many people coming once and never returning."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Little Sister for quite some time now, so when I heard that several folks involved were opening up a new, Dutch-themed restaurant, I knew it was just a matter of time before I was eating there.

My birthday seemed like as good an occasion as any, and so it was that we found ourselves seated in Noorden's intimate space on a warm Sunday night.

Like Little Sister, Noorden's various menu items are designed to be shared, which meant that we ordered a lot of different dishes. Some might say too many. And to those people I say: I'd rather have too much delicious food than too little.

We ate:

PATATJE OORLOG - 'WAR FRIES' (\"Mayo, Peanut Sauce\"): This is a really spectacular play on loaded fries. The menu only indicates the aforementioned two items atop the fries but there was much more going on. It's ultimately that peanut sauce that elevates this dish and I honestly could've consumed that stuff on its own.

CRISPY DEVILED EGGS (\"Gherkin Caper Mayo\"): As advertised, this is a deviled egg that's essentially been deep-fried. It's pretty amazing and tastes exactly like a deviled egg, somehow.

CHICKEN LIVER TOAST (\"Corn Bread, Pickled Onions\"): This might just have been the highlight of the entire meal. The generous chicken liver was nothing short of exquisite, and the accompanying ingredients only heightened its delicious flavor. A true winner.

BITTERBALLEN (\"Chicken, Dijon\"): These are basically croquettes but served in spherical form. They're pretty addictive and the accompanying Dijon is a perfect complement.

SCOTCH EGG (\"Tomato Chili Jam\"): This was probably the item I was most excited to try, since I grew up on Scotch Eggs and consider them one of my favorite foods. The sausage surrounding the egg was tasty but awfully dry, and the unusually small egg inside seemed a little overcooked. And the tomato chili jam was pretty disastrous. It tasted like something out of a can (I know it wasn't, of course), and I wound up ignoring it completely.

GRILLED FILLET OF SEABREAM (\"Sun Choke Puree, Picililli Relish, Oregano\"): This was pretty damn astounding. The fish has been cooked in such a way that it's got this irresistible charred flavor but isn't at all overcooked. My one complaint with this one was the Picililli Relish, which was pretty tasty, admittedly, but since it had been slathered over half the fish, it took away from the tastiness of the Seabream.

GRILLED HEARTS OF ROMAINE(\"Chili Vinaigrette, Goat Gouda\"): This was unfortunately the weakest component of our delicious meal. Like the Seabream, the romaine had been cooked so that it was charred, and that aspect was very tasty, but on the whole I didn't find much flavor in this dish.

We also ordered a few above-average cocktails, and our waiter was completely on the ball the entire night. All in all, it was definitely a birthday to remember."}
{"text":"I really like this place! The ambiance is top notch and the service is very friendly and down to earth. I ordered the #5 gin drink and it was delicious. We also had the scotch egg, the war fries, the bitterballen and the noodle salad. My favourites were the bitterballen and noodle salad. I would come back here. Innovative cuisine! Great addition to Yonge and Eg! We were thanked by about 5 waiters on the way out - great touch!"}
{"text":"Interesting Dutch bar. Although I am not usually a fan of gin and tonic, I rather enjoyed this one. I also had the bitterballen, which is deep fried chicken shaped into balls with mustard which was pretty decent too. I'd say this is a trendy bar to go to with a couple of friends."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the cocktails AND the chicken liver toast. Really. Both Noorden and Little sister are great. Portions aren't huge - so try some lower priced items. Overall quite fair, service was efficient and informative. I'd live th go again.  Not too loud."}
{"text":"Cool things are happening here at this (50%temporary 50% permanent?) pop-up restaurant. 

Highly recommend you check it out."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place! Me and my group came here for Toronto's one and only Rijsttafel and I am happy to say everybody liked it.

For those who don't know, the Rijsttafel (Rice table) is basically Dutch tapas, but the food itself is Indonesian based. Indonesian cuisine itself doesn't do \"tapas-style meals\", so when you are having a Rijsttafel, you are basically doing Indonesian food in a manner that the Dutch does it - originated from Dutch colonial days. 

The Rijsttafel here required at least a minimal of 6 people and one weeks notice. It include up to 20 items (including side dishes) for tasting. The pricing for this is incredible considering the number of items you get to taste ($48). The items are quite unique and you probably won't find it in other restaurants in town.

Some stand-out items include the Ikan bakar (grilled sea bream), Rendang sapi (spicy coconut braised beef) and the Babi kecap (sweet spicy braised pork). We also enjoyed the Dutch donuts (Oliebollen) for dessert, which was the only item on the menu that was truly Dutch. Somebody at my party lived in Indonesia for quite some time and he attested that most items are pretty legit, and some not quite. For myself who don't really know any better, I thought the whole meal was simply delicious.

Overall, I say definitely give this a try, because theis is the only place in Toronto that offers an experience like this."}
{"text":"I have no idea what Dutch Indonesian food is, but if Noorden is any example, it's the best cuisine in the world. Cocktails were fantastic. War fries were easily the best thing I have ever eaten in my life (I dreamt about them later that night). The rest of the food was beautiful and delicious and the waitstaff was really friendly as well. Super hipster interior made it perfect to hang out and talk for a couple hours while eating a variety of small plates and getting a few drinks."}
{"text":"Its funny that when i went to the Netherlands, i didnt really eat any Dutch food, at least not what was served at Noorden. But i guess it makes sense since noorden's food is actually inspired by indonesian flavours. We had a variety of dishes here, including the scotch egg, chicken liver toast, bitterballen (chicken balls), war fries, a carrot dish, and frilled seabream. All the food here is good. I mean i dont usually like carrots or pates but i thoroughly enjoyed the food here. 

The odd thing is, i dont find their food memorable, and i keep thinking if it's dutch indonesian food, how can it not be memorable? None of the flavours there are explosive - i would compare it to a mild date where the person is attractive, enjoyable, and you come back thinking, i wouldnt mind hanging out with them again, but when your friends ask you how the date went, the only thing you can say about the date was, yeah it was good. 

The three of us girls really enjoyed their cocktails and i'd venture to say that this is a safe place to go out on a date or with friends. The food is good, the service and ambiance is modern, and the drinks are great. But you're really there to hang out and not be an epicure."}
{"text":"Little Sister's big sister across the street. Another fun, new tapas bar at Yonge and Eg. The decor is really exciting. Food was excellent but not for the faint of heart. Dutch food meets Indonesian fare, tris time it ends with dessert, not a Japanese military occupation. 

Bitterballen was just about the best thing you can get for $3. Chicken balls in very strong (but delicious) horseradish mustard. 

War fries were pretty good. Fries themselves were just average. Dressed with all kinds of tasty stuff including a peanut butter sauce. Peanut sauce and starch, you can't go wrong. Kinda like if 2 chow mien in Montreal and a freshly dressed poutine had a food baby. 

Tartare was quite good. Served with excellent thick Asian chips. 

Octopus dish was nice. Served with greens, octopus could have spoken for itself more, but accoutrement was well done.  

Skirt steak was really tasty. Lots of different textures. 

Pretty much everything was spicy and quite seasoned. Interesting set of drink options across the board if that's your style."}
{"text":"I guess I had high expectations for this place because Little Sister is so amazing but I have to remember that they are two different restaurants with two different types of cuisine.  The food here at Noorden is Dutch.  I have never had Dutch food before and to my surprise the menu consisted of a lot of things I do not like (chicken liver pate, deviled eggs, cured trout, etc). So for me, my food options here were limited.  I ended up ordering the Pork Ribs and the Charred Broccoli.  The ribs were pretty tasty but the sauce wasn't overly amazing or anything, they were just basic ribs to me.  The charred broccoli was nothing more than charred broccoli, a bit salty for my liking.

My friend ordered the chicken liver, stamppot (grilled smoked bacon with gravy and mash), and the Bitterballen (deep fried panko balls filled with chicken and some sauce).  She said everything was just ok and also a bit too salty for her liking. The piece of bacon in her stamppot dish was super fatty so beware, it's almost like pork belly I guess.

Overall I would not come back here for food but maybe for drinks.  They have about 50 different types of gins and make their own tonic.  The drinks are a bit expensive though ranging from 14+ for cocktails and 'fancy' gin and tonics.

I was impressed by the staff here though, so please do give this spot a try if you're interested in Dutch eats."}
{"text":"Not Dutch, very overpriced, ridiculously small portions, and long wait times. Ribs are overly spicy and have a strange fish smell, eggs are deep fried with a small amount of sauce (an order is 1 egg!), chicken satay is tiny, oliebollen are mini and overcooked at the ridiculous price of $5 for 2. I don't normally write negative reviews but this restaurant is a rip off."}
