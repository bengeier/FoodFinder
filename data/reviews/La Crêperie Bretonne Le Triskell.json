{"text":"WORST LOBSTER I'VE EVER HAD.
Claiming they have fresh lobsters, these were not. They seemed like they were cooked twice. The meat was impossible to cut, and the claws (which are normally the most tender) were dry and chewy. I asked for it boiled, and it came out with blackened claws. The waitress claimed it was not broiled before it was boiled but I doubt it. I have lived in New England, and know my lobster. Never have I boiled a lobster whose claws ended up blackened. 
It is not worth the $24. for a 1 1/4 pound crustacean. In fact, you couldn't pay me to eat it, or there ever again!"}
{"text":"Dull and uninspired crepes with little taste and no finesse.

At least they do offer real maple syrup for $1.75 extra.

Clearly this place survives only on American tourists."}
{"text":"quel dommage ! meme si les crepes n étaient pas fameuses , on aimait bien y aller a cause de l ambiance . C était l endroit préféré des enfants ! souvenirs , souvenirs .."}
{"text":"The service was lack luster and I paid over 20 dollars for a crepe that was average at best. I wouldn't recommend this place. There are way better places for brunch in the city. The decor does get some points though as I love old French bande dessinées."}
{"text":"Le Triskell was a place for crepes,
For many ears it stood in this place,
But alas the store is no more,
And now we may all say grace.

Dead. Finito. Gone. In the past. Future generations have been saved."}
{"text":"Another recommendation to check out so we headed here for dinner. Here's what was ordered:

-French Onion soup ($6.75): came out piping hot and integrated with tons of cheese and pieces of bread (vs traditional croutons). The beef broth was salty (as all onion soups usually are) and the cheese that was used tasted bitter (I don't remember if Gruyere is usually bitter...but I don't think it is). I've had better French Onion soup in the States.
-Sausage, mushrooms and bechamel crepe ($13): The sausages weren't cut into pieces, but rather left in their link form. They were hard and chewy and reminded me of sausage links. On the other hand, the mushrooms and creamy bechamel sauce (white sauce made from milk, flour and butter) made this crepe worthy.
-Egg, ham and swiss cheese crepe ($12.20): didn't try it, but the bf wasn't too impressed by it.

The place is very homey with lots of tables and chairs to account for busy nights. I'm a sucker for white Christmas lights and they had them decorating one wall. There's a bar near the entrance and service was friendly.

I wanted a sweet crepe also, but looking at the menu, didn't find one that piqued my sweet tooth.The crepes are rather expensive, but I've found that food in Montreal is quite expensive anyways (and that's not accounting for the conversion rate). I was surprised by the size of the crepe though (square shape) filling the entire plate, but I've been to other creperies in the States that put more fillings and are priced less. You can order your crepe made with flour or buckwheat...both of ours was made from flour."}
{"text":"As much as there are sour points with La Creperie Bretonne, its really not as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be.  I came here after a night out at the Opera de Montreal for some sweet crepes.  

One must keep in mind that the crepes we are used to are of the French variety, and if you are using that as your point of reference, then your review is probably going to be quite skewed.

I opted for a Strawberry Crepe with a scoop of Ice cream (+$2.50).  The crepe itself was pretty good.  Crispier than the usual variety, and its presence spanned the entire circumference of my plate.  I will add though that I tasted salt (are you using salted butter?) in my crepe which kind of ruined the \"dessert crepe\" experience for me.   The strawberries were also not very fresh, and the crepe was not very neatly folded nor pleasantly presented.  This is a mom and pop shop so don't expect fancy plating.  

I agree with most reviewers that the price point is rather steep (almost $12 a crepe), and I think that $2.50 for adding a scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream is pure robbery.   However, it is not as horrible as other reviews I've read."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge on crepes in general (at least for dinner), but we were in Montreal and it seemed apropos, and my husband is a pretty big crepe fan.

Everything was fine... that about sums it up.  Nothing overwhelming, nothing disappointing.  Hubby had a ham & egg crepe which he seemed to like well enough, kids split a sausage & egg crepe which they also liked well enough, I had chicken & bechamel which was good enough.

Our waitress was nice, service was 'relaxed' but we didn't feel ignored."}
{"text":"J'aurais préféré attribuer une note de deux étoiles et demi à cette crêperie bretonne, mais je ne pouvais pas me résoudre à lui en octroyer trois. Non pas que leurs crêpes soient infectes, mais elles sont dans les faits très ordinaire et on est en droit de s'attendre à beaucoup mieux d'une crêperie, d'autant plus qu'elle clame être bretonne. Les crêpes sont beaucoup trop épaisses et ressemblent étrangement à celles qu'on peut manger pour déjeuner dans un resto de quartier. Aussi, j'ai choisi une crêpe au jambon, et j'ai accompagné le tout d'un cidre québécois, dont je ne me souviens plus de la marque, mais qui était très bon. Finalement, la facture n'était pas trop élevée, quoique beaucoup trop en prenant en considération la qualité des crêpes servies."}
