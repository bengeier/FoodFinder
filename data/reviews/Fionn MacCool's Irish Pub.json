{"text":"12 dollars for a magners longneck, I dunno if that's expensive for Toronto but its a big rip off to me.

We've had very rude waiting staff, and absolutely lovely staff also, most of the time it's fantastic.

The beef burger, used to be prime rib, is lovely. It comes with lovely crispy homemade chips (fries to you Canadians) and a sliced pickle and the burger. The burger has loads of little crispy fried onions which taste a bit curried. It's a really nice smokey burger.

Drinks are expensive, not Irish at all really but then what \"Irish\" pubs really are. 

It's good for a few visits, just wouldn't be my favourite."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers and a beautiful patio to sit out on! Good pub food and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Service is so slow. Took forever for us to get our drinks.... and it wasn't even that busy . 
Atmosphere is okay. Washrooms looked clean. 
Never got any food because of the bad start."}
{"text":"we came here during lunch hour as we were staying across the road at the hotel. The food was really good considering it was a Pub! Pleasantly surprised. :) we ordered fish and chips and the chicken linguine pasta."}
{"text":"So, I have returned to Fionn MacCool's hoping to have a better time than my first encounter.  

When we walked in, the place was completely full it was about a 5-10 min wait for a table.  The same hostess greeted us (and she was really nice the first time) so we were off to a good start.  She gave us some menus to look through while we waited.

I have to say, much better experience this time around.  We had a server named Shelley that was fantastic.  My drink was never empty, she knew the menu, recommended things, and near the end when we gave her the letter the manager sent us to entice us back in, she was apologetic and wanted to hear all about the experience.  

We got the Salmon and the Ale and Cheddar dip.  Both delicious.

Maybe I was wrong about you, Fionn.  We'll drink together again sometime.



I'll leave my old review below, just in case you're curious.  This was around Oct/Nov
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, we walked in at about 4:15, the hostess greeted us with menus and recommended a salad to us.  That was our 2nd last interaction with the staff as we sat there for 15-20 minutes.  We were one of 3 tables in the place, and in clear view of the bar.  The staff just kinda stood around talking amongst themselves, while we stared in their direction.  I could have yelled across to them, but customers were outnumbered by staff, I shouldn't really have to yell across a room. At this point I set the timer on my phone for two minutes and sat it on the table.  The alarm went off, and we left.  The hostess told us to have a good night on the way out.
About a week after I posted this review, I was contacted by the restaurant with an apology, and an incentive to come back in and visit.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"}
{"text":"Not only is the food good but the service never disappoints. Weekday, weeknight, family dinner or club hours.... I can always rely on this place for service and food. Have never had a bad meal and am open to trying everything on the menu."}
{"text":"Firstly,  be advised! The soda/ pop refills are NOT free. That came as a shock to me when I was charged twice for my diet coke. But the restaurant area does have a nice atmosphere and it has good food. I went late (around 10 p.m. or so) and the kitchen was understaffed so it took a while for someone to come to us and they had only a select menu, but from what it did offer, it was pretty good. The beer selection is fairly decent. Can't say it stood out amazingly to me but I don't have any complaints. 
I also assume many male patrons would like the waitresses outfits."}
{"text":"So we came to watch the end of the Champions League final and to stay for a birthday celebration. Honestly, service is a little slow when waiting for a beer to watch the game. Guinness was good - duh. 

Dinner was pretty good, food was timely and warm. One of our meals was 'incomplete', but addressed quickly once brought to Veronica's attention. 

Kids very much enjoyed their meals, they didn't have the hot dogs . 

Not bad."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop by for a drink after work if you work in the Heartland area, or simply with friends. It has a great drink menu with a wide selection of beers on tap and cocktails.
The service is what really stands out though. The bartenders, waiters and waitresses are all very friendly and ready to serve. I've been here only a few times and most of them remember my name.
The best things on the menu are the blarny chips and the grilled chicken sandwich. Anything else is your typical selection of bar food to snack on.
A live band plays on selected nights which adds to an already laid back atmosphere. If you're looking for a place to just relax and have a good time, this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"Sigh, two visits to two different Fionn's in one week and two equally bad experiences. 

This one was so simple it is unfortunately they couldn't get it right and still didn't in the end. My Hubs ordered the Reuben with NO 'rocket sauce', but thousand island dressing on the side, please. Our server even wrote it down. Easy, peasy!

1st attempt: Sandwich came out covered in 'rocket sauce', no thousand island on the side. Sent it back. 
2nd attempt: Sandwich came out covered in thousand island. Sent it back because it was soggy.
3rd attempt: Sandwich came out with thousand island on the side but without mustard on it. 

I then had to track down a manager (because surprise, surprise, our server went MIA). The manager offered to bring the mustard over. Great. He brought over two types of mustard with an apology and offered to comp the sandwich. That was nice! 

Now that you have the back story, here is the real reason I am writing this review...

Another \"Manager\" came over and apologized and offered a dessert. We didn't want one, but our friends accepted the gesture. Great.

Bills come: Sandwich not comp'd and both couples were charged for dessert with a -$0.50 (yes, fifty cent) discount. What? I will not bore you with the ridiculousness that came afterwards, but it took them a total of 7 (seven) attempts and 45 minutes to get our bills right. 

I need to learn to stay away from Fionn's because apparently Fionn's does not like me."}
{"text":"We didn't have a reservation, but they said we could go to the bar and wait. They forgot about us, but we were ok with it. The bartender was really friendly. I believe her name was Jasmine. Busy place. Food was really good we had chicken tacos and poutine. Would recommend it. However. Next time we will make reservations in advance."}
{"text":"All the websites (theirs, Yelp, etc.) say they open at 10am on Saturdays and Sundays. Got there at 10 and their sign has been changed by hand to say 11. Please update your websites. 

Went up the street to Kramer's which was great."}
{"text":"Watch out for those busted coasters they may give you or else you'll be waiting forever.
But all in all the food is great and the manager is nice."}
{"text":"Fun night out. Good crowd, excellent entertainer,  surprisingly good prices on single malts. Nothing bad to say!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family for a birthday for our 88 year old Nana looking for pub food. Choose here, big mistake. We arrived at 5:30, not busy after we ordered our drinks the music was turned up to an uncomfortable level for conversation by the manager. We asked the waitress to turn it down she said she did was not. Asked another who turned it down only to be turned up again by the same manager. My father eventually went up to the manager asking him to please turn it down, he did. I could understand if it was busy but it wasn't and we were with a 88 year old. Food...meh... Ordered chicken tikka with rice. Bahaha three tiny pieces of chicken for $15. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Wow, what a supreme let down. Sure they serve beer fine. But I went there for the love of Irish food as they claim. The lamb pie was absolutely terrible. Almost all dough, very few bits of lamb, and absolutely no flavor. zip, zero, nada. What are they thinking? Do the chefs ever try the food they serve?

To top it off, it was served on a bed of spinach and mushrooms. sounds delectable, right? Wrong! Completely raw baby spinach and canned mushrooms that have been drained are not at all appropriate or tasty complements to a well cooked lamb pie. but it all tasted bland, so at least they are consistent.

they should actually cook the spinach and use fresh mushrooms. the mushrooms were actually cold!!

either cook it right (ok to raise the price a little if you actually serve a tasty meal), or don't bother serving it. In a lamb pie, the signature ingredient is the LAMB... not the dough!!"}
{"text":"The beer is great staff is even more friendly . I will be back there soon as I can maybe Tonight"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good atmosphere. The barkeep kept to the tradition of her service, with spectacular witty banter and service. Wish I lived closer."}
{"text":"Have visited four or five times. Noticed the same thing each time. Waitresses are more attentive to bar and patio guests then dining room.  Have to flag waitress down to get a pop refill or order.  
After tonight am not going back. Waitress screwed up my order and my replacement meal did not show up till  my husband had finished his meal.  No refills offered on drink. No manager came by. And had to ask for a comp on missed meal.  Was offered 25% off my meal only!"}
{"text":"Went in for a beer 4:30 on a Saturday and went to the bar, bartender was at a table chatting with people, she saw me for sure, after almost 10 minutes, no kidding, l start to leave and she comes over and says I was just going to serve you, sorry lost customer for life, never going back! Have heard food not great!"}
{"text":"Came in for Lunch on a Saturday.
Plenty of friendly and helpful staff.
Enjoyed a delicious Club Sandwich and French Onion Soup.
The place was clean, and the beer was tasty."}
{"text":"I live across the street so it is usually convenient to come here. Have been coming for a year and love love love the service! One of the main reasons my boyfriend and I come here is the people. They are fun and attending and personable! Wang, Gina, Lance and Ally usually serve us and they are WONDERFUL! 
The food is probably not the best part, not much variety as we would like but definitely not bad in quality and fall into the irish category. I wish they had chicken fingers! The drinks are great, ceasars are delicious and come with extreme beans like they should! Patio out front with music, clean, live music sometimes and great fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went here in the summer on a nice day.  Service was fine and they could make some cocktails but not all (it's an Irish pub so the fact they have scotch was a plus).  Patio was surprisingly pleasant given its location on Bloor.  No complaints."}
{"text":"I've come here several times now and I must say, even though this place is a pub I wouldn't have imagined how delicious their food is.  So far I've tried their French Onion Soup, Fish and Chips, Reuben sandwich and Fish Tacos. Each time, every dish that has come out has been made fresh with perfect seasoning and has had well sized portion for what you pay. I'm extremely happy and would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Wow. Check out the nutritional info. Salads with 35-70g of fat, and that's without chicken or salmon. Plain Cesar salad, 700 calories with 70g of fat. And just when you thought eating salad was healthy...."}
{"text":"There was something wrong with the staff serving us.. she basically was careless.. gave us a drink we did not ask for.. and added some other drink in the check which we did not have. Ridiculous"}
{"text":"My second visit here for a take out, I guess the first time ranged from OK to good (I only remember really good or really bad places) I had closed the menu and slid it forward on the bar. The bar maid had to finish talking about the plane wreckage they found washed up in Mozambique. What I mean is she didn't finish her sentence so as not to be rude to her colleague, she kept on talking for over a minute, I guess to be rude to me. I left a tip because i didn't want to wait for my change. BTW this was before lunch so the place was empty.

I ordered the fish and chips, and seriously I don't ever remember having fish & chips so bad, The fish sucked, the chips sucked, the slaw was the only part of the meal that wasn't totally gross. They advertized \"fresh cut fries\" which kinda swayed my decision. They were too greasy to really know if they were fresh cut, but they were wedges, not fries.  Even if Fionn MacCools served halibut, I'm sure it would have been the worst halibut I ever had. Its the closest to my workplace so it would have been my go to place on rainy or really cold days, but  I definetely will not be back. The walk to King St is so worth it because of the amaziing takeout there."}
{"text":"I visited this location with a friend a couple days ago and found the service to be excellent. The waitress was very helpful in her suggestions for menu. I ordered French onion soup which could certainly be improved otherwise the overall environment was good."}
{"text":"This is a mixed review. Great place to grab a basic drink before heading to the game. Food has been ok, heavily fried but -surprise you're in a pub, that's usually the fare you get. I do have to say they have a great Caesar salad! Had a chicken pot pie last time I was there- good, but nothing to write home about. 
The 2 stars are afforded: 1 for the Caesar salad and 1 for the English breakfast they serve. Seriously the BEST for a hangover- and they don't judge when you order it at 330 in the afternoon...so there's a positive. 
Where things go downhill is sadly the service. The host that \"greeted \" us at the door was less than friendly.  He stared me in the face (too close for comfort- think Seinfeld Close talker-and simply said \"where do you want to sit?\"  I said hello, smiled and mentioned a booth would be great. He sat us down and promptly walked away. When we had finished our meal- my S.O politely asked him for the bill as he was standing next to us. At which point he said \"sure\" and then proceeded to take the utensils and drum solo on the table next to us. He reached his drum solo finale- and at that point went to find our server for the bill. It was actually quite rude. Trying to save the experience, I wished him a good day on the way out, to which he iced me out and walked past me to talk to a server. 
In summary: good Caesar salad, great hangover breakfast, watch your step cause it's icy at the door. :/"}
{"text":"I want to like this pub but it's managed to disappoint me every time I've been.  The food is ok, not great.  It's always crazy busy and very loud.   The last time I went I was with a friend and it was so dark in our section she was unable to read the menu.  I've only ever been in the evening.  Maybe it's better during the day...."}
{"text":"Food and drinks were good. Service was a fail. Staff were unattentive and really not friendly.  This is unlike most other restaurants in their chain.  Disappointing.  Won't be returning.  I don't have this kind of time to wait for drinks or servers to pay attention."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, good selection of local and international beverages . Seasonal menu so there's usually something new to try all the time. My favorites are the Cod and also the Lamb."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. When it comes to ratings I think a lot of factors come in: the food, interior, service and also the company you are in. If you are not fond of the people around you then the food will taste bitter and the beer will feel flat. I haven't had any of that. The beer was fine, the food was decent and everyone had fun. Our waitress seemed a bit cold at first, but that's just her personality. She was great at doing her job and we appreciated that. It helps when you say \"thank you\" to someone who cleans up your dirty dishes. We had a company lunch today and we loved it. I will visit again with my friends soon."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the fish and chips. I wasn't really hungry but I devoured it. Pretty good atmosphere for a Tuesday night. I'll be back to try the Guinness burger."}
{"text":"I actually found this place because I was fed up with waiting in line at Cora's and wanted a good breakfast place around the downtown core.  The breakfast is very good and has a relaxing atmosphere without any lines or crowds.  I also really liked their potatoes with the breakfast.  The only bad thing, is the breakfast opens at 11am.

At night, it is also really good.  The food is great, with a good selection and a classy atmosphere for an Irish bar.   They  also have live band's once in a while and have good specials during the week.  Lastly, it has a solid location, being right in front of the CN tower."}
{"text":"The best chicken sandwich I have ever had.  My sister loves the lamb dish and the vegetarian burger."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Server took forever to take get water and could never find any servers for service. Included gratuity +8 without asking in the beginning. Never again."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I had the Shepard's pie and it was delicious. The atmosphere was great as well. Not impressed with the service and staff."}
{"text":"horrible wings they are not lightly dusted.  The service was good and so was the lemonade"}
{"text":"The newly refreshed Fionn's in Ajax is awesome. I am totally hooked on the Rover bites and fish tacos. 
Their cheesecake dessert is tremendous. They had a live band in there that was really enjoyable. I will be back to try more items off the new menu."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food. The menu and drinks overall are more expensive than I would expect, or that seemed normal to me.
For example, a pint of Keith's is $8. 

Good service, decent food but not as good as you would expect for the prices."}
{"text":"I have a co-worker who works here so I decided to give it a try last night with the bf. Decor looks great, nice spacious bar area, which was packed, for their nightly events. Dining room also nice, lots of booths but only a few tables present. They also have an awesome selection of beer and whiskey, obviously. About 15 beers on tap! 

They have a very simple menu including: soups and salads, sandwiches, burgers, meat pies and a selection of seasonal specials - including a bison burger, sounded interesting but didn't try.

We started with the Blarney chips to start - basically lattice fries dressed like nachos, not bad but definitely not enough for $12.99! Very small portions of salsa and sour cream also.
I had a small crock of their shepherd's pie ($9.99) with veggies on the side. I've never tried shepherd's pie before, but I'm pretty sure theirs didn't do it justice. I was imagining chunks of potatoes and meat but all I got was small bits of ground beef, so that threw me off. 
Bf got the prime rib burger ($10.99). Not bad, but not spectacular. He was it was a bit dry. Also only received a small portion of fries. Personally I would've liked lattice fries better as the side. 

Service was par.

Definitely would only come back to hangout at the bar for drinks and munchies. Ideally not my kind of sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Our experience was far different than the previous reviews. Perhaps they needed a bit more time to properly train front house and kitchen staff. 

Overall, an excellent experience for our first visit. During a busy Friday lunch Friendly staff seated us right away and our waiter was quick to follow. 

French onion soup was very good as was the Prime Rib burger and classic English style fish and chips."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch today, I live in the area and pass by the place quite often. Sat at the bar with my co-worker while we waited for a table and ended up enjoying our bartenders company so much that we stayed. Violet made sure our beers were always full despite how busy she was and was prompt with everything we needed without being intrusive. She took the time to get our names and help us with the menus. Food was decent, the service and beer specials were what brought us back after work."}
{"text":"When I think of a hotel pub, I have a common misconception of somewhere that sterile, lacking character and only visited by out of town guests. I think Fionn McCool's does a good job of appealing to locals and travelers alike with its solid menu, daily specials and traditional Irish decor. Definitely not just a boring hotel pub! 

Fionn McCools doesn't seem to have the same crazy lunch time following as some of the other restaurants in Eau Claire, so this is a great place to dine when you are being told it will be a 45 minute wait for a table elsewhere! It has great salads, typical Irish pub food and if you are feeling a little treat, the waffle fries are to die for. 

The best time to visit this pub, however, is after finishing a running race in Eau Claire! The beer has never tasted so good, and the big table in the back is perfect for an all day Sunday Funday with friends.

{"text":"I really like this place. They have good food, good service and surprisingly good curry! The only con is that it's a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now & I have to say that the food here is exquisite! 
Try the Calamari & Shrimp appetiser, the Shrimp was so good!
The atmosphere here is quite nice as well, there's always a good crowd around & the staff is very friendly & there's a DJ & a live band playing on the weekends."}
{"text":"A little loud for my liking. The food was really great, I had a Poutine and a Pulled Pork Hoagie. The Poutine didn't have enough cheese curds, but the fries and the Guinness sauce were delicious. The pulled pork hoagie was amazing. The beer prices were a little high, but not so bad that you would avoid the place. The service was fast and friendly.

I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place has a perfect location in the mall. The crowd is welcoming, the music is fun, this is my ideal Irish Pub.

The food is very good, though you do need to pay though quality."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Irish pubs, but totally the opposite when it comes to an Irish pub food.
We stayed at the Sheraton for Christmas, and decided to try this place for some drinks. After carefully looking at the food menu, we decided to try our luck and get something to eat. I had the Guinness Burger and a beer, and I was sold! It was one of the best burgers I've ever had!
Highly recommended when you're in town. Also, the staff (Jennifer in specific) were very friendly."}
{"text":"Great service and the food is awesome too! We had the Maple cider salmon and shrimp with fries. Both dishes were flavourful and had decent portion sizes. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Thought I would grab a quick lunch at Fionn's. I have been to others and enjoyed my experience. However, to my disappointment the food was overly greasy and bland. I needed to wait 15 minutes after given the menu for lunch. I had better service in a cafeteria. Felt little welcome since I wasn't the after work crowd. I won't be back.

I do hope they do not only cater to afterwork crowds."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  Diverse menu.  Competitive prices.  Fionn MacCool's accepts SCENE card so you can collect points!!"}
{"text":"Clean, warm and inviting atmosphere. Generally when I visit a restaurant, aside from the menu, I watch the staff and how they are when NOT serving customers. The Staff seemed very content at this location.

Our order was complete with appetizers (we skipped dessert) entrees and drinks. The food was delicious, fresh, and prepared quickly. We had a new server and she was fabulous. We went with a Boxtee and signature sandwich for our entrees, Blarney chips (or Irish Nachos) which were fabulous! The bill was under $60 with tip!

I am a sucker for their Irish motif and I love the overall feel of the establishment. The owner himself came by our table to check on us and I had the opportunity to tell him directly how fabulous his restaurant was. There is live music at this location, just not when we were in. It would be an excellent spot for a family to dine.

We would recommend this restaurant to our friends."}
{"text":"This is a nice Irish restaurant with a good atmosphere of out for some drinks. The service is excellent along with the good. They have one of the best poutines but however they took off one my favourites which was the chicken skewers, they were so damn good. I didn't even up going back after the last time finding out it was off the menu and the reason being was revamping the menu. From pictures on Yelp, I will go back to try their blarney fries."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great service and very friendly people all around. Very homely vibe. Best place for lunch, after work beverages or hangover brunches."}
{"text":"very pretty downtown patio separated from the sidewalk by flowerbeds, with a view of beautiful old st paul's church and the manulife building.  LOVED the salmon leek pie i ordered.  all my friends also liked what they had.  service was very attentive.  it's a bit loud inside once it gets full. all in all a good experience.  i definitely want to eat there again!"}
{"text":"This place has such poor servers, I waited for a waitress to get me a drink for half an hour you're better off just walking up to the bar. The bathrooms are atrocious. There's always broken locks, clogged toilets, and toilet paper all over the floor so you have to check your shoes every time you leave. And to top it all of the DJ sucks"}
{"text":"Went there with a buddy of mine - I had been to other Fionn MacCool's locations and in general had a great experience. Was not expecting anything major from the place.

The pub is well... your regular pub, with pub fare and drinks. What else would you expect? Service was prompt and professional. Was really happy to see that they serve Ontario craft beer (HopCity's Barking Squirrel - a GTR craft actually from Brampton) - a great beer as well, recommend drinking instead of the occasionally-stale pints that are sometimes served.

The food is where I was stumped. The burger was DRY. I mean well-done crispy and feeling pieces of charcoal in my mouth. The salad that came with it was blah. Was a bit in a rush and did not bother to re-request it, although under different circumstances I would have sent it back.

I agree tho that it could have been an honest error. My buddy's steak pie was actually nice and he enjoyed it. This is why I give the place 3 stars and not less (such a bad burger deserved a 1 or 2 star rating), but the fact that it was mostly an honest mistake, the great craft beer served and the professional service earned them a bit more."}
{"text":"OK - My dislike of things \"Chain\" is well known.  But a chain pub? Really?  Doesn't that sort of pre-defeat the entire essence of the pub concept?  

This was a typical group drag-along, you know the deal - taken several blocks out of your way with a bunch of people you're not even sure you want to be out with... and you end up at Fionn MacCools.  

The drinks are nothing to right home about - uninspired selection of mid-shelf booze and craft-like beer with a chain resto mark-up.  Service was decent, but in no way exceptional.  

But the food.  The food is truly an abomination.  This is the place where the wash-outs from Applebees training academy end up.  Limp fries and chips and chili from a recipe that I swear they ripped off from my high school cafeteria.  Bad food - truly bad.  

The people turned out to be pretty decent and I ended up having a pretty good time; the extra star is a charitable gift as a reminder of a pleasant evening out."}
{"text":"This is a nice little bar with good service and good food. They make the best Shepherd's Pie in town!"}
{"text":"Pretty much what you'd expect from a chain pub-style restaurant attached to a hotel.  Pretty average across the board, but good for a quick lunch or a few drinks in the evening."}
{"text":"Super slow for bar tender to even recognize I exist.  After 10 minutes of multiple times of eye contact I got up and walked out. Again...I was noticed walking out but was never asked if I needed anything. Never going back!"}
{"text":"I've had so many great times Fionn MacCool's for so many years I almost don't want to go any more for fear of ruining an awesome streak, I fear the law of averages!

Fionn's has everything. Great Beer (though a bit of a commercial selection and less local), excellent food, competent service, a nice old pub look and great location. It's a bit of an older crowd and filled with a healthy dose of corporate Calgary which might be off-putting to some, but like any good pub the attitude is all casual. You wouldn't feel out of place if you wore a T-Shirt here.

It's a bit noisy inside, but more from the numerous conversations going on and less from the music playing. Again perhaps what most would want from a pub. For a more intimate conversation experience you might want to try the patio. 

I had a Seafood Pie ($13.99) which was a whole lot of awesome! Shrimp and chunks of fish in white wine sauce enveloped in a pastry textured bread bowl equals pub food heaven! Even the salad was impressive, with a healthy dose of greens including my favourite, arugula!

Over time Fionn's has become one of my favourite place to hang out after a hard days work!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing experience! My room mate and I went here Thursday night and everything was amazing, the food was a 10/10, the music was fun, and the service by Alysia was outstanding. We're foodies and both worked in the food industry and we both will be coming back to enjoy more of the quality food and experience. This was the experience you want to have without expecting it because it's still a pub technically. This was above and beyond my expectations and I can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Fionn MacCool's last night for an event.  From the outside, the place looks like a big pub but when you enter it is quite cozy.  Our group was tucked away in a corner.  The server was prompt and quick to serve.  Food was average pub food, nothing I ate really stood out.  

They do have live music on busier nights, (Thursday to Saturday) which makes it a true pubby feel.

If you are in the Clarkson area and up for a pint, stop in at Fionn MacCool's!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 0 stars. But I have to give one. I can't think of any place I hate worse than this Fionn Macools in Clarkson. I've been blessed with friends who are what one can only call 'stupid', and they enjoy drinking here, which means I still occasionally have to stop in (kill me). 

The food sucks. It's not even really decent, it's just not good. I haven't tried too much of the menu, but from what I have tried, I know it'll never happen again. The burger is a dried out piece of shoe leather on a non remarkable bun. Typical frozen fries. Thick black disgusting gravy. Don't get the poutine, you might hurt yourself (I'm not even kidding).

The service is brutal too. I had an issue with one of my meals, and the server didn't come by for 20 minutes... I had to go get the manager myself, he was nice and corrected the mistake. When she came back around she was snotty and appeared annoyed with me. My first ever 0 tip.

Apparently now they have a 'club night' with a dj and... you won't believe it... a 5 dollar cover. I'd rather be killed by means of firing squad than acknowledge Fionn's with a cover. 

Terrible place, do yourself a favor and stay away."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of chain restaurants for the most part, but my colleagues wanted to come here. I did not have high expectations. At all. I can honestly say I was very pleasantly surprised.

The decor was pretty nice. Definitely a cleaner, newer, more attractive version of a classic pub. The waitstaff was very nice. Our server was super friendly and didn't blink an eye at a couple modifications my table made to our entrees. 

The prices are a bit on the higher end for a pub. And the portions are a bit on the smaller side for a chain restaurant. This is good for those who don't want to come out feeling stuffed or those who prefer to order apps, entrees, and dessert. Not great, I suppose, for those who love to feel stuffed after one entree. 

The food was good. I had the lamb shank (mmm, I love lamb) and it was yummy. Tender and flavourful and obviously cooked low and slow as all shanks should be."}
{"text":"What can I say.  All the Fionn's are good.  As much as trendy and modern bars are meat market's and \"the place to be seen\" (not my thing) there's nothing like a good mock-up of an Irish Pub.  No attitude. No Drama.  Just friendly folks."}
{"text":"Tasty food and great service!! Overall an excellent experience! They have a great drink menu with a wide selection of beers on tap and cocktails. 
The service is what really stands out though. The bartenders, waiters and waitresses are all very friendly and ready to serve.The best things on the menu are the blarney chips, tacos and the grilled chicken sandwich. 
A live band plays on selected nights which adds to an already laid back atmosphere. If you're looking for a place to just relax and have a good time, this is a great choice!"}
{"text":"I do not like writing bad reviews unless I have several bad experiences.

I live just next door of this bar.

I enjoy the patio a lot but....

The servers (ladies three of them) clearly have emotional and attitude issues. They are rude, hardly smile and lets be honest they make the situation uncomfortable. Plus take years to get the drinks.

Plus they try to trick you with the bill.( happened twice)

One day I told one of them out of the blue: you should let him go....

She was in shock because yes I guessed she was pissed by his relationship and for instance giving me  and other customers a crappy service.

I hope the owner and these waitresses read this review. I would fire these two girls I will not say names but you know who you are girls.

The other servers even the bartender males are such attentive and nice individuals, congratulations to them.

Peace"}
{"text":"FACT: poutine is one of canada's national food groups...
FACT: i am a new yorker...
FACT: i hate poutine...

but I do love fries, and i love things on my fries...
why on earth would i do that? for fries and stuff on my fries of course!!! BUT NOT GRAVY!!! i love the layout....it's very wide open when you first walk in....they seemed to have enough room for private parties.... my cousin that lives in the area suggested this place, and something has to be said about the comfort factor of this bar...

my dear yelpers, a five-star burger experience is about the sides, the drinks, the service and the atmosphere....and Fionn MacCool's delivered on all fronts!
this Irish pub (could you guess by the name) sits unassumingly on a quiet corner just in Ajax. i was worried about the quality of food, but was seemingly impressed!! 

once inside, you're exposed to worn, strip-hardwood floors, cozy little side-rooms (good luck getting one after five or during lunch on a weekday) and a dining area that somehow manages a warm feel despite its sprawl across the rooms. the décor is classic Irish pub with nothing specific to write home about but overall is very homey...

the lamb was thick and juicy, and you could tell it was made in-house...it was best grilled medium-rare, which left it pink in the middle, but didn't have to deal with dripping blood as the ground beef kept all the juices in the meat, instead of on my plate. i asked for a pulled pork dish, and while visually I thought I had been shorted on the fromage, it turned out to be the perfect amount and lent a beautiful bite along with the hint of spices...

the service was prompt, charming and comfortable....it's always nice to deal with someone who knows their menu...."}
{"text":"Don't let the no nachos on the menu fool you. The Blarney Chips are their version of it - waffle cut potatoes are substituted for tortilla chips. They might be better than regular nachos, but for the ballpark style nacho cheese they use on them  - not a fan.

I also had the Guinness burger which was excellent. It wasn't chewy and overcooked as often seems to be the case. And speaking of Guinness - Finally a place in the area that serves it cold! I've had it a few restaurants in the area and none were as cold as it was here."}
{"text":"Totally unimpressed. Although the reviews are decent, don't be fooled. We dropped by for a quick drink last month and the service was terrible from start to finish, with a terrible attitude to go with it.

Having waited for 10 minutes to place our order, our drinks were delivered quickly but our waitress didn't check in with us once afterwards. We had to hunt her down for the bill and when we finally got it, it was flung on the table without a word spoken.

I have a feeling that this place caters for the after work crowd and they weren't too impressed that we were only having a drink and not ordering food. Other than that, I can't think of any other reason for the downright rudeness. I have never refused to leave a tip at a bar before, but this place takes the biscuit. Never again!"}
{"text":"Great place for a pint downtown! Definitely a casual, pub, atmosphere. Food is pub style; it's good and not greasy."}
{"text":"Awesome place for food and drinks. Go on a Thursday, Friday  or Saturday to hear live music or djs.

 I love coming here! The yorkie sheppards pies are to die for. If you come here for anything, you have to try them. 

The irish chips are killer. I can have just those all night with some drinks. If your just hanging with the froends for a fun chat consider coming here.

The cocktails are super good. I like teying the different drinks / beers. its just an overall great place to eat, chat and feel awesome.

If you wants an amazing evening this is where you need to be!!"}
{"text":"Nice pub atmosphere.  Big place.  Tv screens.  Happy hour specials.  Too bad the chicken pot pie portion was so small.  I'm not a big eater but left hungry!  Service was a bit slow but staff were quite pleasant.  Indoor and outdoor patio.  Only 3 stars because of the food."}
{"text":"I guess I'd call myself a daytime regular of sorts and I have to say that I have never been disappointed with the service or the food. Peter is fantastic behind the wood and the main reason I keep coming back. Above average selection of beers on tap now that they've included Beau's and Muskoka. I'm a sucker for the beet salad. 
Manny runs a tight ship and I'll be back over and over again and telling all my friends. 
The veggie burger is the best in the GTA. Hands down."}
{"text":"Very good food, not just bar food. Had a piece of fish that was cooked nicely. A bit pricey but worth it when compared to options."}
{"text":"I've had the lamb pie twice and it is so good. The warm mushroom salad too. 
The menu is really decent. Lots to choose from, but I already know what I'm coming back for besides the draft. Ya, lamb pie!"}
{"text":"Really poor service in the bar area.  Grumpy waitress is an understatement.  Only 3 types of bottled beer available. Very rare for me to write a negative review.  Won't be back"}
{"text":"Yeah, I would say A-OK.  Corner of a hotel, with great service.  Food is pretty darn good, though I would caution about getting really excited; their french onion soup is okay, at best.  And, yet people go wild over it.  Not sure why--fish and chips were, again, pretty good, the fish was well cooked but overbattered; everything that I say on others' plates looked varying degrees of \"above average bar-food at restaurant prices.\"

I was in the hotel, so I loved the convenience.  Cannot imagine going out of my way to eat here.  But still, you should not be terribly sad if you end up here."}
{"text":"Solid little in hotel pub.
They handled our drink orders quickly (even though there were a bajilliion of us)

Nice selection.

Pros:
Inside a hotel
Good service
IF you get drunk you can go walk to your hotel room
If you get drunk and don't have a hotel room you can maybe \"share one\" with a friendly stranger from a different city 

Cons:
No parking 
A little expensive for a pub, around right for a hotel pub."}
{"text":"I've been there twice, once during the first few weeks of it opening, and again on a girls night. Both times have been great.

First night they had an amazing band playing. People were up and dancing, it was a really nice atmosphere. Just had some dessert, the bread pudding, it was pretty good. Love all of their Whiskey options!

The second visit I actually had a meal, Shepherds Pie, and it was really good as well. Again, excellent service and nice atmosphere.

Only downfall as a patron.. its SO busy and can be a little noisy. It's all in good fun, but its definitely not a place to go for intimate conversation. I'm not a huge fan of the lay out.. and if only there was a dance floor! Expect fun and music and good whisky."}
{"text":"Part of the Darcy McGee's chain. It is your typical Irish pub chain - somewhat decent variety of beer, pub food with Irish names (the Blarney chips are pretty good), and servers in kilts.  In sum, for downtown TO it's good but not great!"}
{"text":"I had the ruben which may seem odd, and you're not wrong, but it was so good, it was right.

Marble rye, really moist pastrami, great sauerkraut, fantastic pickles.
But maybe what was most surprising was the Irish chips, fresh cut potato chips served with a sriacha-mayo sauce...unreal.

They had a good selection of beers and the indoor seating was nice, as was the patio.  A good find for a place in a hotel.  I really liked it.  The music was great 90s era stuff I knew which was a bonus.

Good staff, friendly and I would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"can I give zero stars?

I don't know if it was just the day but I had horrible service the WHOLE day. First Moxies then here.

I came here to meet friends from Seattle, and then we were off to the jays game. we were sitting on the patio.

I'm pretty sure the server forgot about us as we waited over 30 mins for her to come and even get our food order. we could have walked out on the bill and she wouldn't have known.

FINALLY after we got fed up of waiting we flagged down a server to take our food order. I actually made a comment to say \"can you help us as I don't know where our server went\" turns out it was her- NO APOLOGY. more so she rolled her eyes and said \"what do you want\"


didn't write down our order, forgets my coke and the extra sauce we asked for. when I mentioned I was still waiting for my coke while my friends had their drinks she rolled her eyes at me. 

when the food comes she didn't come ask how it was or how we were doing. 

lastly, she could clearly tell we're going to the jays game but took 20 mins to bring our bill. I was so beyond annoyed with her that I actually told her she can read my bad review on Yelp. i asked to speak to a manager and her response was that I'll be waiting for a while. at that point I couldn't care to be there, and didn't want to be anymore late for my game.

I will not return."}
{"text":"Like this place but a little overpriced. Waitress and bartender were nice. Ordered the \"flying pig\" to go with poutine it was great although a little cold by time I got home. Definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":".Shopping at Cross Iron Mills works up an appetite and what can you do when you need to waste sometime before a movie and want a beer? Go to a pub, that's what!
We walked on in and sat on the lounge side (apparently children are allowed on the other) Overall I thought that our waitress was friendly and service was good - however there were a couple short comings....

I was delivered the incorrect beer - no big deal really, our waitress was good about it and took the other one away and got me the one I wanted. The second thing that bothered me was we got 2 starters and 2 mains all at once... where is the timing/spacing? I mean, our table was a bit small to begin.

We ordered the shrimp cake sliders which were small but pretty tasty, the ale & cheddar dip (which I found very heavy and did not like the flavour) was delivered to us warm not hot and was already separating... 

For mains, the better half got the stacked reuben and I ordered the beet salad, these were both pretty tasty but what you would expect for pub food.
Would I go back? Eh. One generic pub is usually like another, but If I want a beer and find myself at Cross Iron again... chances are high due to slim choices."}
{"text":"I met up with Poppa U (yes that's Kris U's dad) here last night for a casual hangout and some quality father-son time. 

Prior attempts to meet here after work seemed to fail as the after work crowd packs this joint anytime after 6-6:30pm so we arrived shortly after 5:15pm and had out pick of seats in the restaurant or bar side. 

It's a chain so if you've been to one FM you've been to them all, however, the caveat with this location is I noticed that it appeared, more open, cleaner and less like a dingy traditional pub and more like a proper restaurant. 

We're both trying to eat healthier, so maybe a place that labels itself as a gastropub/bar wasn't the best laid plans BUT with the new Ontario law about all menu items at chains needing to have nutritional information on the menu for every menu item helped to make this less difficult, while certainly being more eye opening. 

Dad went for the straight up burger with a side of garden salad ranging in calories between 1080-1200, this was without cheese or bacon but all the regular toppings one might like from a burger. He seemed to enjoy it, yet dad is like me and a lover of food (hence why we both need to be healthy) and has simple tastes so he would have enjoyed it either way. It was a decent sized burger though and the \"healthiest\" of the burger/sandwich section. 

For my meal I had a real tough time, everything I craved was 1500-2200 calories, basically my current max daily range. After some review I realized that the braised lamb shank with mashed potatoes and grilled veggies was only around 700 calories so I went for this. Much to my surprise before I could say 'shank' to my server she interrupted me and said \"ughh great choice it's really fantastic\", so this made me super happy about my more health conscious decision. 

The lamb shake was beautifully played, I mean for pub I was really impressed - it could have easily been served at a shi-shi 3 star restaurant except for the fact that it was a sizable portion. The lamb was so tender it broke apart with minimal effort from my fork! The seasoning on the meat was classically simple but delicious with the flavors going all the way to the bone. The potatoes were, well they were as you'd expect not too lumpy but not too runny. The veggies were cut into long, thick grilled spears and were lightly cooked and still crunchy. The dish was finished off with a gravy that, while not needed on the lamb, really worked perfectly to kick to sides up a notch. 

It was the perfect portion size, I was content at the end, didn't feel stuffed at all but couldn't help using my finger to get the last bits of yummy gravy off the bottom of the plate! 

I was really impressed with their efforts, their staff and their food. More so than I've come to expect from many of these big chains. We both really enjoyed our meal and decided to make this our regular meeting spot for future father-son night out. 

Eatcrest out!"}
{"text":"Fionn, oh Fionn! Many a times have I spent my nights here. I love this place and it's a popular spot amongst my friends. I love their beer variety, their drink specials and the intimate beer environment."}
{"text":"DIS-GUS-TING!!!!!! Omg everything was awful, three of us went for drinks and appies. Just plain horrible. Tacos... grose, chicken tacos.... Grose and super spicy, red wine sangria..... Better off throwing up in my mouth. Waitress seemed bothered and slow, mind you she was pregnant. 
Needless to say will never return."}
{"text":"This should be a standard issue Irish pub but falls far short. Indifferent/unfriendly wait staff and poor quality food. 

Had the \"steak\" and mushroom pie and couldn't find more than one piece of beef. I kept eating thinking the next bite would have some beef in it! Afterwards I told the waitress and she said she spoke to the manager and they were going to talk to the kitchen. Then they charged me full price anyways. Thanks guys!

Previously had the fish fry which consisted of strips of way over cooked fish doused in hot sauce. Seriously: just put fish in deep fryer. Take them out!

Too bad whoever is running this place has such low standards. It's close to our office."}
{"text":"It's a nice place to go for some drinks with friends, it is a family restaurant but it is more appropriate for older adults. 
The food tasted great I had the Guinness steak and mushroom pie, it came with mashed potatoes and gravy. The gravy was awesome! Great flavour and the flacky pie was delicious! I felt the positions were a good size, I definitely did not leave hungry! I loved the different Irish dishes, it's not something you get to have all the time. I also tried the Bread Pudding Bites, they were also really good, the sweet cinnamon sugar bread bites dipped in the salted caramel was an awesome combination. I would highly recommend! 
My waitress was very nice, and the host was very kind as well. I would definitely go their again! 
There is just one thing I don't understand about this restaurant... why do they have two Indian dishes? The restaurants whole theam is \"Irish pub\", and to make things better I haven't heard good things about these dishes. With that said, I haven't tried the dishes myself so I can't say much about them. 
I gave this restaurant a 4/5 because the food was amazing, and different. The only reason why I didn't give them a 5/5 was because they strayed away from their theam on the menu. It was kinda of confusing, and honestly I don't think thoses two dises should be on the menu at all. 
With all that said I would go again, to try other things on the menu and have a great time. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Lived in United Kingdom for years, this place is pretty quaint. Which makes me wonder what Calgary really is, is it French-Canadian, is that Irish, is it iEnglish, Canadian? Regardless of their confusion and fetish for 80s music of every Canadian singer on every radio station and in every bar this place is actually pretty cool. Their homemade pies are really good, except they need a little bit more meat in them but nonetheless the service has been awesome  and a great beer list. Regardless of anything, the people here have been extremely awesome and super nice. This place is definitely worth checking out, probably one of the better ones if not the best in the city."}

{"text":"We ended up at this place as our regular haunt is now showing UFC or other events for that matter without audio! 
Its easy to get a spot here as it doesn't seem to popular. Beer is list is mostly mainstream generic stuff.
My buddy and I were starving so we ordered an appetizer of mini Yorkshire pudding to share and for the mains we both got steak and fries. 
The Yorkshire pudding had a filling of tandoori chicken a bizarre combo in my opinion. The chicken had no kick and was very bland.
Service was good though as we were checked on regularly. The steaks arrived in a reasonable amount of time and were done to our liking. The onion rings were surprisingly good, pity the fries and steak were sub-par.
They have good setup to watch UFC but unfortunately its not in High Def why oh why they buy all these expensive TV sets and not show HD?
We were still hungry so went for a dessert of volcano chocolate cake. The dessert was OK as well.
I guess one can come here if the other places are packed but otherwise its just another generic pub."}
{"text":"Sitting here right now, waiting for an hour and a half and still haven't been served. We have a young puppy at the groomers to pick up. This shouldn't be taking this long - extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Three of us came here for breakfast on a Sunday morning and the place was almost empty, with only 3 other diners in the restaurant. We seated ourselves and the server brought us menus very soon. I ordered eggs Benedict, and my companions ordered the breakfast sandwich and the pub breakfast. We got our drinks fairly quickly, I had a pot of tea; the tea was stale and old as the teabag was not individually wrapped. Don't have tea at a bar, I guess that's the learning experience here! I kept nursing my tea slowly drinking it, hoping to see some food soon whilst my tea was still warm; after maybe 20 or 25 minutes, the food finally arrived. The kitchen was very slow, which is odd because there were just the 3 other customers in the restaurant. My companion took a bite of her home-fries that came with the breakfast sandwich and let out a cry of dismay; the home-fries and slathered in Maple Syrup!  I like Maple Syrup, love it in fact, but NOT on basic, potato home-fries. I tried mine and sure enough, mine were also covered in syrup. Disgusting. The server came back with the third plate of food and I gave him the two orders of home-fries and said they were covered in something sweet; he said that that's the way the fries are and it is mentioned on the menu that the fries are covered in Maple Syrup. We checked the breakfast menu again and could find no mention of that fact so I don't know where he got that from; maybe it was in the smallprint on the main menu. We ordered some ordinary fries to compensate. I cut into my eggs Benedict and the eggs were overcooked and hard. I waited for a bit for the server to come back but after a few minutes he was nowhere to be seen and as I had to get on the road back to Ottawa I just decided to eat them anyway. We could hear the server trying to expedite the kitchen and get our fries, and I hung on as long as I could to eat some fries with my Hollandaise (which was very good, actually, one of the better Hollandaises' I have had recently) but to no avail, I had finished by the time the fries arrived. they were good too, hot, crispy, and nice and thick. My companions breakfasts were OK, nothing special and overpriced. The 'Bratwurst' sausage advertised on the Pub Breakfast is nothing of the kind; it is a basic English sausage, better than it's North American cousin for sure but not a Bratty. The Pub Breakfast seems like a lot of food when you see it on the menu but when it comes, it is not that much food at all. You don't even get home-fries but, as the experience above describes, is a good thing. The server did apologize and said I should have told him the eggs were overcooked and I mentioned that I would have had he come back to check on our food. And I didn't want to wait another 25 minutes for replacement eggs, so i just cut my losses and ate my food. He did comp our tea and coffee, so he was trying his best to accommodate us and I did tell him the sauce was great.

My companion, who has been there before, says the service really is bad and always slow, so I guess this is the norm for this place.  Anyway, lunch and dinner are better apparently, so my advice is don't go here for breakfast. There is a better place just a couple of doors down that does a real breakfast for about half of the price of this place."}
{"text":"Food is good...not \"wow\" but good.....atmosphere is lively but a bit dark.

Service is better than food so worth coming and trying...I think you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a business meeting in the evening. Nice decor, with an updated and much cleaner feel than the traditional dingy pub scene. There was a live guitarist playing that night, he was pretty good and having some fun on his acoustic with an interesting mix of songs that kept the bar feeling fun and social. Lots of TVs around the bar showing different sports, a good bar scene for the game if you like to go out for the games. Service was a little slow but the restaurant was fairly busy. My associate and I ordered steaks and they were cooked correctly only the waitress gave us each others plates. They have a good list of beers, not much for ciders on the menu, and full stock of regular and premium shots. Menu is very simple and easy, not much in way of actual irish pub fare, meat pies are their main \"irish\" dishes. Would have liked to see more fresh/home made items. They highlight what is made in house on the menu but its not much, usually sauces or baked goods. Definitely pub level in the kitchen so don't expect anything too crazy. Overall a nice spot to get together with friends or business, but not the best place for a date or quality dinner."}
{"text":"This is a good place to chill after work and grab a drink or two. It's usually packed and you would see familiar faces all the time since it's super close to the offices nearby.

Although Fionn's isn't big, its still lively after office hours. Even with the taps and bar area around the middle, the seats are always tight here as it gradually becomes super packed. At certain tables, the chairs are also quite high and there's minimal room for bags (note: more for the ladies). Several TVs surround the restaurant at all angles, so no matter where you seat, you can still see at least one screen. 

P.S. There's also an outdoor patio that's super nice during the summer.

They have a lot of finger food as well as meals, but our group always orders the blarney chips. They are good! We asked to add bacon and I think it literally was like one bacon chopped up haha. Suggestion: they should also add more cheese! However, I think the other onions, peppers and tomato bits were all in good shape. The chips itself was tasty too, just wish there were more melted cheese on top :P

Their grilled bread with BBQ chicken was delicious as well. It was sliced into pieces imaging a pizza. Somewhat crusty at the bottom yet soft. The bread was piled with a lot of onions and coleslaw, and chicken bits on top.

I enjoy sweeter beer and my preference is usually Rickard's White. Fionn's doesn't carry it but an equivalent alternative is the Belgium Shock Top.

The bar's service is alright. When there are more customers, they get less efficient and don't always notice new customers who enter the place and need to be served. Happened multiple times, but it's no biggie:)"}

Really good too."}

I live very close to this location and wish wish WISH I could have had just 1 good experience to keep me coming back. I walk past it every day and it's usually busy with an awesome looking patio I could enjoy on a regular basis. Unfortunately I've given it probably 3 or 4 chances now and each time am increasingly more disappointed with the service and the general way the place runs. 

The servers aren't particularly rude as they are clueless, wait times are horrendous every single time, food is mediocre and the last and final time was so bad we asked for our bill and walked out before we could even order food."}
{"text":"This is a chain that gets four stars for one reason: it has good Indian food that tastes great with your pints. There's nothing like good curry at a pub! Toronto doesn't have enough of this.

Get the Tikka Masala chicken curry -- it's very good English-style pub curry. It comes with a little bit of naan and rice. 

The beer selection is decent and the rest of the menu is pretty average.

Another selling point for this pub is the large patio out front, which is great in the summer. The interior of the pub is pretty average."}
{"text":"I prefer this place in the summer when the patio is open and there are plenty of places to sit and enjoy a drink.  Unlike a lot of the other pubs in the area, this place actually has great seating out front and a decent view of Bloor Street to boot.  The place in the winter however is a bit less to be desired as their food doesn't really stand out much.

I've come here a few times for dinner and usually the food is decently priced, but not as delicious as some other places with authentic pub food.  In fact there is some stiff competition with the Bishop and Belcher close by with a larger interior and better prices.

Their poutine with Guinness beer gravy is a good idea and I feel they need more dishes like this to help separate them from the other abundant Toronto pubs downtown.  Overall a nice place to grab a beer after work, but not the best place to eat in the area if you're looking for pub food."}
{"text":"When I lived in Cambridge, I would drive by Fionn MacCool's in Kitchener and wondered what it was. I assumed it was just a pub, but the outside looked so classy with rich colours and clean lines, I wasn't really sure what to expect. 

I've long since moved back to Durham, so I set my eyes on the Ajax location. We headed over for lunch on a Saturday. The sun was shining and the patio was calling us! 

After a look at the menus, we were delighted to see that they had brunch until 3pm! That sealed the deal. My man ordered Our Original Benny and I chose Brekky Pie. Even though we hadn't eaten breakfast yet, we couldn't resist ordering a pint. The been menu was impressive and diverse. I tried Shock Top and he tried Red Stripe.

He LOVED the eggs benedict. He used all of his homefries to eat ALL of the sauce. His plate was clean in record time....and then he started eating MY homefries. GRR! My Brekky Pie was delicious. The pastry was flaky and tasty. The scrambled egg inside was full of fresh veggies an Guinness bratwurst...holy crap. I'd like to try those brats alone, because they were DAMN good. 

The service was great and did not hesitate to offer suggestions when we were unsure. I really liked this place. It had a great vibe. I'd like to try more of their food and beer selection! 

It's nice to see that pub food doesn't only consist of nachos and wings!"}
{"text":"Came here for a bite not too long ago. I'm not a huge fan of chain Irish pubs, and I get nervous when they have too many TVs. That being said, this Fionn location is not bad with decent service and food."}

{"text":"Its in the lobby of my friends building so its a good place If I Have time to kill. It's a chain so it loses some points there. It also seems like the red headed step child of the chain, with the place being pretty dead anytime except right after work on Fridays."}

{"text":"The service at this Fionn is great! But as always, the food quality/taste is not as good as you imagine it to be... but it's a great place to bring a huge group of friends (party) and just enjoy time together with a lot of alcohol!"}
{"text":"This Fionn was very odd. The service was ok, the food wasn't great. Had a huge group of friends here and then all of a sudden at 9pm, you see a lot of security start to appear and the place turns into a night club! It was very odd when we were all just trying to have a conversation here... did not expect that."}

{"text":"Went with our family prior to the blue jays game.  Everyone's meal was really good . Highly recommend the burger."}
{"text":"We tried this place for the first time hoping for good food.  Judging by the prices on the menu we were expecting top notch.  $20 for steak and fries.  $12.50 for a salad and then in small writing $4 extra for chicken.  That's $16.50 for a salad - it better be good no?

Food came and the steak looked good - too bad it was as chewy as gum.
Such a cheap piece of garbage meat and when the waitress asked how everything was and I told her about the steak she kinda just faded away with a \"Oh, uh, did you ...... uh\". Gee thanks for your help.  She never visited our table again and then one of us had to get up and go to the counter to pay.  When we complained again they said \"it's ok, you don't have to leave a tip.\"  Which we didn't.  

As for the salad?  Good salad, fresh strawberries but the chicken was as dry as a bone and warm to cold.  The fries were overdone as well.

I signed up with Yelp just to leave this review - stay away and save your money. Bill was way over $100 for about $10 worth of food - unbelievable.

P.S.  The Guiness was on special for $6.50 and when I asked what the regular price was the waitress replied, \"oh it's always $6.50 but we have it for $7.95\".  Some \"special\". What a joke."}
{"text":"I like it here. The staff are friendly. The owner, Josh, is always interacting with customers and makes himself very accessible. 

The food is great. I highly recommend the prime rib burger. 

Solid beer selection and a nice patio that is close enough to Bloor street for people watching, but protected enough to keep the noise at bay. 

Check it out."}
{"text":"Super slow service. Cold food. Friday night in the summer not busy.hmmm. 

First three months it opened several years ago food was great...looks like they had a change iof ownership and chefs.

Disappointed. Only good thing is location."}
{"text":"3.5 - I'll round! :)

I've come here twice - both times with colleagues - and found the place to have a great atmosphere that is perfect for work outings. I had the steak and fries both times and was pleased with the kitchen's attention to cooking my steak medium-well, just as I like it :) The fries are great and I believe they are served with a bit of arugula which I thought made for a delightful pairing.

Fun place, priced on par with other steakhouses on Front/the vicinity, food is tasty."}
{"text":"This is our default choice for lunch when we're too cold to really walk anywhere.  We shouldn't be repeated customers, but it's winter outside!

Fionn MacCool's is out of its league handling the lunch hour crowds and the food esthetics are deceiving. Luke-warm French onion soup, burnt on the outside pink in the inside burgers and no-dressing salads? Is this indicative of their lunch hour quality? I think so! But hey, at least we get unsatisfactory food served with a smile and humour on the side. Maybe the food is the staff's inside joke.

And are red onions supposed to be in coleslaw? Really? People mix those in there? Ewww!"}
{"text":"Very enjoyable.  Great beer selection and the food was very good.  Perfect place to just sit and relax."}
{"text":"Don't know what happened. But portions got bad and food got worse. 

Decent live music and drinks though."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this place. I travel a lot so I eat out a lot so this place lacked something. I thought I was going to be impressed with the bacon donuts with shrimp but eh.  The service was good just wasn't impressed with the food."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now. This was the first time eating,so hence my first review. Food was OK but the service was atrocious. The place is empty and the waitress had no idea what she was doing. The other 2 only started helping when everyone started getting their drinks and food themselves. Not sure what their hiring standards are, but it doesn't involve knowing how to serve. Would be a good place if service wasn't so bad. Food showed up cold, shot showed up without my beer, had to get my beer myself. So don't bother."}
{"text":"French onion soup in the middle of July. Sure if it's good. And the soup here sure was. My friend and I came over for lunch. It was a dreary day out and I was wanting something warm. We both had the French onion soup. It was baked in a bowl and filled with lots of onions, some bits of bread and covered with cheese. I think it was Gruyère cheese and it was really really yummy. 

Thursdays they have craft addicts beer specials for $5.50. At first I thought the waiter said crack addicts. 

The service was good, prompt and attentive. However, our waiter pulled a fast one when my friend went to pay. He was too nice to say anything but I wasn't. I phoned the manger to bring this to his attention. Basically, the waiter charged us for something we didn't ask for. We thought he brought us this special extra just to be nice. We had no choice since he just came on over and poured it in our soup. Let's just say that it wasn't cool to have to pay for something you thought was going to be free and we couldn't have said no to. Anyways, the manager agree that wasn't cool. So if you go and have a guy waiter who works the tables right across from the bar, beware. Or better yet, move to a different table."}
{"text":"I'll admit it, I visit this place regularly for two reasons:

1) It's across the street from my office
2) Friday pint pairs from 4-6 for $9.99. That's two of Guinness, Harp, or Smithwicks.

As it turns out, if you stay late enough on a Friday, they have live music as well. Note that the Bloor and St Clair W locations have the Friday special as well, not that I'm a beer whore.

As for the food, well, it's a Prime Pub, so you're not going to write home about this place being authentically anything other than generic. 

In the end, if you're looking to kick things off on a Friday night in the core, this isn't a bad start."}
{"text":"We randomly went here tonight and were glad we did. The staff here are amazing and attentive and I'm sure are a big reason this place is usually packed. They have two sections one for a more private vibe and then a open area that has a good pub Atmosphere.   Both are great just depends on whether youre on a date or want to get wasted in a fun pub setting.  Really good beer selection for a good price and they're icey coldies. I can't stand cool temp beer.   The steak and fries was surprisingly good, the steak was well seasoned and tender.  Not a typical pub steak. We also had the Reuben which was decent, great toppings but some pieces of beef were a little tough.  

Tonight they had live music which we usually can't stand but the band they had were really good and played some memorable songs. Overall this is a great place, whoever runs it knows what they're doing."}
{"text":"Second time here. Clean, Irish pub. Good beer selection... But same ol same. 

And the kicker? NO NACHOS. What the heck???

What kind of pub doesn't have nachos. They do have a wacky deep fried potato chip \"nacho\" thing. Meh. $14 and not nearly as satisfying as a nacho platter. 

But Fridays they have $11 for two of any draught beers. 

Pre movie drinks. Make it so! 

Looking for something new and interesting? Wrong spot. But for what it is, its good."}
{"text":"Love coming to this location have been doing so for many years great atmosphere veggie burger is awesome always feel at home the best server in the house is Melissa always makes you feel like you're coming to her home if you can sit in her section she always makes the experience that much better"}
{"text":"Good meal. Quick lunch on our way to Edmonton from Lethbridge. I had fish tacos, enjoyed them, pretty standard fish taco but that's my go to meal so I was happy. 

Restaurant was decorated for Halloween in a tasteful way (well as tasteful as Halloween decorations can be!) I liked it"}
{"text":"Cider and beer on tap, good burgers and busy before the Jays game. Fun spot with a small patio to hang out on."}
{"text":"Typical Irish pub chain with very decent food. Great sweet potato fries. Came here for a late lunch, so I unfortunately can't say how busy it gets or how the service is during the busy times. But, service was friendly and we all enjoyed a good, but basic, lunch."}
{"text":"I went a week ago with some friends for dinner. The place was packed because of the baseball game, so it was very loud at times. We were seated right away and our server was nice. There was a live jazz band which I liked but it made it hard to hear what my friends were saying and I had to yell over the music to be heard. I ordered the wings and the poutine. The wings were good but the poutine was not good."}
{"text":"Went to this pub lured by thier advertising for there hand made to order fish and chips. Lucky for me on Wednesday they have a special for 10.99. So I order the one piece and was not disappointed. Tender fish with nice chips and a really good coleslaw. Well be back to try other things on there menu."}
{"text":"Friendly and rapid service, but the food not too good.. Last time we have tried a veggie burger - it came out nice looking, but without any taste.. However, if you live near and want a rapid drink, you should go for it at this place."}
{"text":"A reliable pub for a drink.  The food is OK.  The staff are pleasant, but some of the patrons talk way too much leftwing politics and it gets old quickly.  Seems like a decent spot otherwise."}
{"text":"Friendly service, comfortable seating and good selection of drinks. 

The place is comfy and cozy, intimate, really.  We just came here for drinks, no food. It was a great place to hang out."}
{"text":"Surprising really good food for a pub/bar! Wait staff are amazing! Love the atmosphere. Appetizers and sides are on the pricey side but worth it for the most part. Highly recommend the Blarney chips!

My only complaint is that soda pop is $3.49 - quite overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday evening around 7/8pm and the place was poppin' - the hostess said there's only space at the bar side which was fine since we came to have some drinks and an appetizer anyway. 

We ordered two glasses of the white sangria and I also had the raspberry blood orange cosmo (I think that's what the name was). Both very good and the service was great. 

Calamari was ok, a bit oily/soggy near the bottom of the plate and it came with a sweet chilli sauce instead of your normal tartar sauce types you get at other places. To be honest I don't think I would order that again the next time I come. 

Live music at 9:30 which I loved! Such a great atmosphere, I would definitely come again for more."}
{"text":"Friday night, too lazy to cook, so here we are.   Fish and chips and lamb shank and a decent Caesar to wash it down.

Service is friendly and rates 5 stars.

Food came out pretty fast.  Fish and chips rated 8/10  and the lamb shank was a 5/10.  For the $25 I expected a fall off the bone lamb with delicious sides.  Meat and potato were barely warm and there was what can only be defined as a sprinkling of vegetables - literally 2 sticks of zucchini and three small pieces of grilled red peppers.

Perhaps the popular wings and burgers are their strengths and that's ok.  Just don't put other lofty items on the menu that's overpriced and not all that good.  I think The Queens Head downtown Oakville is much better..."}
{"text":"Review on the Run.

I'm torn.  The service has always been good.  So +.  The food is awful. So -.  But the Blarney Chips (Waffle Fries with nacho toppings) are my fricken most favourite thing ever.  So ++?

Torn.

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor

Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn

Conclusion: Eat Here?  Only for a pint and some Blarney Chips."}
{"text":"What can I say, it's an Irish themed pub in a great hotel. But it's not the Hotel, it's more like a neighborhood pub. Go often and be a regular, you can't not enjoy the pub grub! I miss he free oysters on Friday though! It used to bring us downtown!! 

Treat yourself to valet parking!!"}
{"text":"Came here after work on a random Thursday. Cool atmosphere, not very busy. They had outdoor seating which was nice and a live band. I found a piece of wood in my French onion soup but the manager apologized right away and comped my soup only. The bartender Carly was very nice and even asked my name and remembered which is uncommon these days. All in not a bad experience but not great either. I'd give them another shot when I'm back in good ole Canada."}
{"text":"Met a friend for lunch here and I asked staff if a chicken pie would be a good choice. She was honest enough to tell me that Mondays and Tuesdays are the best for the pies and that she herself would not order a pie on Wed... hmm.. I really wanted one anyways and she turned out to be right. 
Whomever was cooking today did not give a $^&*(! The pie was dry and cool inside and tasted microwaved. The side salad of mixed greens was good though, they have a Strowbow vinaigrette that I can recommend as being quite good.
It would be nice to know that the food can be trusted as consistent.
Apparently you cannot go wrong on the flatbreads - will go for that next time.
OH, and I asked for a cup of coffee which the waitress did not recommend either as it is instant mis garbage. YUK!  I listened to her on this front and skipped the caffeine."}
{"text":"Went for the first time, and had a great experience. Great service, food was amazing."}
{"text":"Très bon, service rapide et agréable, je recommande!"}
{"text":"I love all Fionn MacCool`s that I have ever been to. I was skeptical when I walked in to this one as it is rather small and there were not a lot of staff. The patio is a good size and set up nicely. It did take our waitress quite a while before being asked to order drinks but she profusely apologized and was attentive for the rest of the night. I really enjoy all the food I`ve ever had here whether its sharing an appetizer with friends or having an entree. The irish chips and dip, Guinness poutine and rover bites never disappoint, the salads are delicious and fresh and I had the pleasure of trying a mushroom steak boxtie which was so filling and also completely delicious. They almost always have some sort of drink deal or food deal whenever I go. Honestly my ideal pub/bar/restaurant. I go here with my boyfriend, my best friend, I would bring my parents here no problem. I honestly recommend this place to anyone and everyone. It is a completely relaxed, fun and comforting environment."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night to check out the bar scene. It was beyond fun.

They play EDM/House music outside and have a more hip/hop, rap, r/b, reggae mix up inside. Coming from California I think the drinks were decent priced. We had 4 jaeger bombs, 2 rum and cokes, a cranberry vodka, and a beer for $57. Not bad at all for 8 drinks.Inside was packed and hot. We spent a good chunk of time outside in the lounge chairs. We had a pretty big group so we took up the whole thing.

FYI: Open tabs are only available with credit cards.

We didn't order any food. But the music was great, the crowd was amped. It was such a good positive, fun environment."}
{"text":"A typical pub with a patio. There aren't a lot of options in Davisville/Yonge so why not? 

You'll find your typical pub fare here with a slight Irish touch. We ordered fish and chips and a pasta dish. We also got beer (that's what pubs are for right?) The fish and chips tastes like what you'd expect fish and chips to taste like. It wasn't excessively soaked in oil. And like most places in Toronto, the fish is always the frozen variety. The bacon clam pasta was good, but I felt the portion was a little small for the price. The clam shells make it look bigger than it actually is. If you take out the shell, it's not that much food. Or I'm a big eater. 

I'm not too strict about the food in a pub because I don't go to pubs for the food. A pub is a place where I'd care (slightly) about the atmosphere. Like most places, they have daily specials, and TVs with sports. There's really nothing noteworthy from my visit, except that I find the prices slightly high. It gets a solid 3 stars. You can't go wrong here if you're just looking for a regular pub experience."}
{"text":"Never be a table for one at this place.  Told there was no tables for one available and I could see if I could find a place at the bar.  Gee. Thanks.  Especially when the couple BEHIND me was then seated at a two top in between two empty tables for two.  Shoddy.  Ya think?"}
{"text":"Food has always been awesome here! The blarney chips are delicious, however all the apps are delicious. Have been here numerous times, and only one time was disappointed with my dish because there was only a few pieces of chicken in my salad, but they were great about it. 

Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Saw a fly in their vinegar bottle. Fish and chips was blend. Chowder was blend and not thick enough. Over priced and bad quality food. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The fat fuck in with a security shirt and glasses  cherry pick who come in. am from new York never been profiled before I came here. management needs to look into this issue before they found themselves with a lawsuit. Zero stars don't waste your money on time here."}
{"text":"This was a great place. The server was friendly and the atmosphere was pleasant. The food was good, and the beer was better. And did I mention the server was excellent. She was."}
{"text":"Excellent Sangria the girlfriend says, I liked that there was beer on sale. :) Calamari was good to share as a snack. Nice Irish atmosphere pub."}
{"text":"I've seen these franchises popping up around the city, so decided to give this one a try since it was in the area.

The first thing I noticed was it seemed far darker than general restaurant or pub lighting. The skirts and Irish theme was alright, but it seemed inconsistent with the menu style and signage around the place. It seems that the printed material has been updated to represent a new, cleaner cut brand and experience that isn't anywhere close to what you experience inside the restaurant.

Floors were a bit sticky and grungy, which I could get over if it was a true pub. But it's not. It's a franchised restaurant trying to fake being a pub, and it fails at that. Anyway, onto the food.

We started with the Beet Hummus Dip which was excellent. For my main course, I was expecting to have Pub Food, but after seeing the strangely diverse menu I decided to order the Chicken Tikka Masala Curry. Again, Indian dishes at an Irish Pub... doesn't make much sense. The dish was brutal, but that's what I get for ordering Indian food at a Pub and expecting something even remotely close to edible. Why this is on the menu is beyond me.

We ordered water to drink and that wasn't received well. The waitress was more interested in her tip than doing her job.

Below average service, below average food, and overall a very confused franchise trying to be something it is not."}
{"text":"This place is so kewl. Nice heated patio. Great beer. I love their Blarney fries. It's basically nachos with waffle fries instead of chips (picture below). Innovation! Very tasty. Once you go Blarney you will never go back to nachos. Great service. Free WiFi."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for my husbands company function, our hotel basically shares a parking lot with Fionns. We didn't really want to drive anywhere, as we knew we'd be drinking. We entered expecting typical bar food. While it's not a Chef Ramsey style restaurant, the food was still delicious! We originally sat at the bar. Appetizers: I ordered the Great Poutini and the guys ordered The Crowd Pleaser both very good. We went through two Crowd Pleasers. The bar staff was awesome, friendly service, very attentive and good drinks. Everyone we encountered were very nice! As more friends rolled in, the staff asked a smaller group to switch seats with us, so we could take over the larger table. Thank you to that group! 

Main course: husband and I split the Rueben and both loved it, they even worked with us and put the sauerkraut on the side, as the hubby hates it. Multiple other main course items were ordered by our table, I've forgotten what they were, but know everyone enjoyed their choice.  

On a side note, the washrooms were clean, as a woman it's so relieving to see a nice clean washroom! Not saying guys don't like clean washrooms. 

Overall, a very good experience."}
{"text":"Live singing outside, decent patio, awesome food (wings & curry) and cute servers!

Nuff said right? :-)  

Wings have a good sauce on them and shrimp and haddock in curry was very tasty.  Apps also amazing!"}
{"text":"I think that Sheraton's pubs are a well kept secret. We have never gone wrong with patronizing their pubs. 
Fionn MacCool's is a pleasant pub with a great patio on the corner of 3rd St. and 3rd Ave. The food is some of the best pub food that we've had. Prices are reasonable, and the service is great."}
{"text":"Decent bar food, good choice for late night

Live music, friendly staff, lots of choices on menu, price is fair

Not a bad bar for Mississauga where picking is slim"}
{"text":"I work in the mall and whenever I am in the mood for a long lunch a cold beer after work this i usually my destination. They treat me well, feed me, and I can usually have a good laugh.
Better than anything else in the mall by a wide margin"}
{"text":"Fionn MacCool's is generally a great place to have a drink; we had some visitors from out of town staying near by this location so we stopped in for a drink. It was nice to have a hightop table for our group of 7. The prices are generally high and i am not too sure if they have drink specials. Would be nice to know if they have a happy hour."}
{"text":"We were here today (Sunday) and it was empty. It got a bit busier when we were leaving. 
We got the bud light draft on special and the blarney nachos. They're lattice fries, which I knew going in. One weird thing was the long chunks of green onion. Trying to put them on the fry and eat it was awkward.
The bathrooms are a little tricky. I almost walked in the men's. My boyfriend said he got confused too. The W one isn't women's. Look at the small picture beside it."}
{"text":"We had originally wanted to watch the Jays at the Kort House but it was closed so we came here as it is across the road. 

The place isn't really known as a sports bar but they had multiple TVs and a projection screen.  For a place like this at 8:30 pm we got great seats in front of the projection screen. 

The servers were dressed much like the Titled Kilt.  Low cut dresses and high mini shirts.  Eye Candy.  

Anyway, the crowd here is under 30. So five guys over 40, it was not a place for our demo. 

But the game was on and they had the TV audio on so we stayed.  

But the service was crappy.  We sat down and no one came to take our order for 10 mins.  While we did not have anything off the menu the selection of beer was decent.  For all you Molsons and Sleemans fans they don't serve either on tap or in the bottle.  

Given that the bar had seating for 10 customers - they did at least have three attentive servers.  I am not sure how the rest of the place was mapped out but we rarely saw our server during the game (about 2 hours).  And even when she took a refill order she'd come back 20 minutes later and apologise that she had forgotten our order. 

One her second reorder, she came back with 1 of two beers and said she had had an issue with the ordering system. Plus she had to cash out a group of people behind us.  I have no idea what that meant but for the four hours we were there we saw her three times before settling the bill.  My friend joked that the people at the bar had no issues.  

Any way at the bottom of the 9th inning the big projection screen kaks out but they got it back for the last three minutes of the game.  

Immediately after the game the music pumps up and drowns out any conversation.  The place becomes a dance bar later and I think the music was a hint for us to leave. 

So we had to wait another 15 minutes just to find our server and ask for the bill. 

The parking lot is a bit tight.  And as we leave there are these kids showing off with their friends.  A few were clearly drunk and they scooted around trying to find a place.  

However, given the fire codes in Brampton the place had maxed out so thankfully many of the inebriated patrons were turned away.  The odd thing is the place has a patio but is was not open.  They used it as a smoking area instead.  Too bad."}
{"text":"Nice location close to the cinemas and arcade makes this a great place for pre/post movie nosh. 

Gluten sensitive available, however the bun on my companion's burger crumbled to dust and was really less than optimal. Usually that happens when the bun has been defrosted for an extended period of time prior to serving (days). Or was refrozen more than once.  Disappointed with the care of gluten free needs there. I did ask more than once if he wanted to send it back because of the bun and the over-char on the meat, but for time he decided against it, he ended up eating the burger sans bun with cutlery.

I had the cider glazed salmon, and it was cooked through, but, a little over-charbroiled on the bottom. Same as my companions burger - a bit much for our liking. It was busy and we did not send them back to the kitchen. 

We also had the white sangria. Unusual because it had cucumber in it, but a tasty addition.

We'll likely be back to try it again on another visit to Calgary. Although it seems commercial restaurant food and service, when in a mall, you find what works for you.

We visited in late August."}
{"text":"Fionn's is a reasonable choice if you work in the area or if you are staying close-by.  Not much else to say about it, really.  It's a very straightforward \"Irish pub from a box\" kind of deal."}
{"text":"Came for the ufc event, $10 cover at the door. Not many options when you're scrambling to find a place to watch the fight. There was a good vantage point from anywhere in the bar from I saw. Their night menu which was very limited to finger foods/apps. I ordered the Sheppard pies which were 4 small yorkshire pudding type pies. It was really sweet, like almost too sweet like a Korean bakery. The ones were good enough that I enjoyed it, unfortunately the portions were tiny. I wasn't even close to being satisfied in the belly! 

Decent draft selection , with some Ontario crafts and of course Guinness. 

It's more of a 2.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"This review is based on two visits. The first was on a weeknight around midnight and it was freezing cold, had just got off work and needed a drink.  My colleague and I walk to the red door, go to the bar and order a beverage. Unfortunately, we arrived and it was last call. Boo. Glad we made it to sneak one in at least. 

Next review.  Saturday Brunch. Holy shit the Breakfast Pouting is off the hook. With a fried egg on top, with bacon bits and mayo. 

Im not from Toronto but this was some BANGIN poutine."}
{"text":"Last visit: Jan 2014
Order: double beer braised beef sandwich with  fries.

I really liked the sandwich as it was a crispy beef du just sandwich.  It was sweet, salty but on a crispy bun.  Amazing.

However the fries totally turned me off.  Even though they used sea salt, I thought the fries were slightly soggy and not seasoned well enough.  Even though I ordered the chipoltle mayo to go with it, I wasn't a big fan.

In terms of the atmosphere, it lives up to its name for an Irish pub.

Verdict: not a bad place if you're in the Heartland area and want some decent food and drink."}
{"text":"Got the latke grilled cheese- yummy but very small. Salad was also small. Service was good, nice ambience."}
{"text":"Yeah, I'll agree with the review on everything else about the alright decor, and friendly environment, but...

The staff get skimpy with mixed drinks. When I dropped the shot into my beer cocktail, the full shot glass was still above the level of beer in the glass. On another occassion, there was too much ice in a rum & coke. Prices are not cheap."}
{"text":"I keep going back to try new menu items. Love the friendly staff and always enjoy the food."}
{"text":"This my favourite place to grab a poutine! The location is perfect for the guests staying at the element hotel hotel and very close to many homes and basically off Highway 7 and 27.

The staff have always been very friendly and accommodating. I think my favourite part is the atmosphere.  I love the live band on the weekends and how it looks like a restaurant on one side and a pub/bar on the other. The food is also pretty good, I love that they're experimenting with fusion foods on their new menu. Definitely a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"I normally don't hold high hopes for chains but Fionn MacCool's exceeded every expectation I might have had.

One of the bartenders was as knowledgeable about every product he poured as I've seen from brand ambassadors. He was friendly and outgoing and shared that he wasn't just an exception but that the chain actively sought out and rewarded that type of personality and provided the training on the products.

The mini shepherd's pies were excellent, too.

It delivered on all of the key things I look for. Decent food at fair prices, friendly and knowledgeable staff and quick service. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Service here is really slow but food and drinks are good. It you aren't on a time limit and don't mind spending a few hours here then I would recommend it. It's generally however not a good place to grab a quick bite for lunch however. 
I work just around the corner so I'm here quite a bit after work with coworkers or friends."}
{"text":"Best service I've ever had. Really down home feeling, great food and and even better atmosphere. Our server was actually from Ireland and it was the cherry on top of an amazing after shopping lunch"}
{"text":"When you need a spot to eat some pub food and enjoy a night of live music and don't want to travel downtown, then you've got to try this place in New Market. This is a fun, casual eatery of Irish influences ..hence the Gaelic name \"Fionn Mac Cools\" - the menu has all your pub favourites from various pot pies, pub grub, even curries and my favourite braised lamb shank served with veg and mashed potatoes. On this night I had the melt in your mouth lamb shank(it's one of the more expensive items on there menu at $24 )the gravy was nice and dark and not too salty. I washed it down with a few Guinness stout ..,hey doing it the Irish way. We went with a large crowd of 12 and our server was most accommodating to do separate bills (we were in couples but all the ladies & men separated). We tried the \"blarney chips\"  which were crisp, hot and delicious - these are basically waffle chips with cheese sauce drizzled over them and served with \"nacho\" condiments. 
After our meal we stayed and drank while the live band played. The server told me people sometimes dance in front of the band - I clearly didn't get drunk enough or else I would have - I know cut the Blarney! A lil Irish humour. 
Overall I would go back and drink more too."}
{"text":"I came here looking for a bar that was showing UFC.  I'm glad to report that is a great place to watch UFC.  Loads of tables, big screens, and a projection theater.

The food was not too bad.  Compared to the other generic \"Irish\" wannabe pugs, this one is better than most.  They have a few treats with a UK spin, like the Yorkshire puddings filled with chicken curry.

The service was so so.  One of our servers was real quick, and very friendly, and let us reserve a table way ahead of time. However after what appeared to be a shift change, our new server was very slow and we had to wave her down for any little thing we wanted.

I'll definitely come back for some UFC action."}
{"text":"The food is really good but it is pretty expensive compared to other similar restaurants.
For example the waffle fries are amazing but they cost $14.
I'd recommend trying it but personally I won't be going back too frequently based on the cost."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday night and it got real busy since the last time I came here! As I entered, I smelled all the wonderful offerings they had, but I decided to go with the fish and chips special for $9.99 on Wednesday.  It was a great deal!!! The fish was nice and crisp, it was a large portion which came with fries, coleslaw (which was really tasty) and dip for the fish.  Also had the calamari as an appetizer.  It wasn't anything special. I give this place a four stars because of their daily deals.  They also seem to have more food offerings than when they first opened, or, perhaps maybe I just realized the variety of food offerings because the place was really busy and I was looking at all the food on the other tables and those being served.  I'd come back.  I'd try another entree."}
{"text":"The food here was overall not very good. The onion soup was too salty, the cabbage & corned beef had a very strong mustard taste to it, & the buttermilk chicken was dry. The sides - mashed potatoes, salad, & coleslaw were good. The only thing that they did right was the seafood chowder. 

The overall ambiance is good, the live bands were terrible & kept playing loud country music. The table server was excellent!

Will not come back!"}
{"text":"Very Limited beer list. Deep fried everything. Bitchy service. Nothing good about this place. I gave it two chances but the service was the same both times. I'm not sure if the management has put the servers in a bad mood or if they just hire bad tempered people. Not my job to figure out why. Suffice to say I won't be back and I'll avoid other Fion MacCools as well. It baffles me that such an easy formula for a pub can go so horribly wrong."}
{"text":"Awful food. Period. 

I could and should write a lengthier review, but aside from the friendliness of the server, there isn't anything to write about - never again."}
{"text":"Food is good as always but the place is definitely aging. Beyond that the service was very slow.  Still a good plan B if other spots are full"}
{"text":"I really have to hand it to the staff that attended the large party I was with on St. Patrick's Day this year which is easily their craziest day of the year. Food was on point and servers were on their A-game at checking to see if we needed anymore drinks and giving us our correct orders."}
{"text":"Seems like an OK spot.  Was staying at a hotel nearby.  We went to try and get breakfast, and, this is one of the only locations in the chain which does NOT serve it.  I've eaten at Fionn's before, and, if you're in the mood for good pub grub, try it out."}
{"text":"HAPPY CANADA DAY TO ALL MY FRIENDS IN THE GREAT WHITE NORTH.eh? 

This Fionn MacCool's is indeed the hotel bar for the Sheraton Suites Eau Claire. The prices are probably higher due to business traveller types like me, but I have always found it a comfortable and friendly place to hang out. That's especially true during the Stanley Cup Playoffs or during the CFL season when an exciting sportscast goes well with a burger and few dark beers. There are probably better sports bars in greater Calgary, but I'm not usually city-saavy enough to search too long for alternatives. What I like best is that after a full meal among friends, it's great to head over to Princes Island Park, admire the Mighty Bow, and enjoy a decent walk in whatever season."}
{"text":"Heard about this little gem from my wife and we decided to give it another try. I tried the Cobb salad and thoroughly enjoyed it. There is lots of other dishes that look delicious on the menu, like the miniature Yorkshire puddings with Sheppard's pie inside. That'll be for next time."}
{"text":"Oh boy here we go. I always feel slightly bad when I give out low stars but this was just a crappy experience. 
Came here for a friend's BDay after some Archery Battle, which is very physical i.e. makes you hungry! It was a pretty large group but they had a reservation so it is not like the business didn't know how many were coming. We had one waitress for two big tables of people, and she tried, she was nice and it wasn't her fault. They should of had another person to help her. 
We got our drinks in a timely manner. I got a radler, always good. The food however took an hour and a half to come not including the obscene amount of time it took the one waitress to take everyone's order. So by the time we were able to eat it was 10pm. It is insane to make patrons go through a wait that long. 
I order the vegetable curry. It came with Naan, the saddest small serving of Naan ever. I know how much it costs to make this dish, it's cheap, so stop being so stingy and give your customers a full Naan. That would be so unacceptable at an Indian restaurant. 
The music was ok, the staff was nice but they really messed up with the way they handled a large party."}
{"text":"This is always a busy spot.  A cool pub that often has live music.  I have only been on weekends so don't know how cool or how live music it is during the week!

It's a great spot to stop for a couple beers either before or after your Saturday night plans."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed dinner here! We were here on a Thursday after work and it was picked inside but we found a quieter spot on the patio. Everything on the menu looked really good. We ordered the buffalo cauliflower to start and it was very tasty. I ordered the fish and chips and it was delicious. My boyfriend also really enjoyed his chicken/bacon burger. Service was quick and efficient. I would go back again for a bite after work."}
{"text":"Yesssssss... Success!!

Been here for a couple of different types of visits, a few times to grab lunch or dinner, and a couple of other times to get sauced up on some great beer and maybe a couple shooters as well. 

Regardless of what I was there for the quality or the service, the food and the drink was very good, went with a large group of 12 and they were quick to get us all seated and it didn't even falter the service at all having a 12 top with all split up bills. 

For drinks there's tons of choice in both the beer and the booze departments, a couple of fun shooter trays to down with some buddies like a plank... There's another device too I couldn't remember the name of where u hit a plunger and it drops 4 shot glasses into their respective glasses of mix (i.e. jager shots into redbull)

Every thing I've ordered from the menu for foods has been quality, but the winner so far has been the fish and chips, such a good beer batter, the chips are cut nicely and got a nice crispyness to them, even the coleslaw on the side is real nice.... The tartar sauce is really really good..... Get extra tartar sauce, dip some fries in... It'll put you in a happy place. Go there!"}
{"text":"They stuck to the formula for a cookie cutter restaurant. Even though MacCool's is brand new to Newmarket, the whole thing looks like it came from a plan book. I don't have a problem with that, they worked hard to make an Irish pub look like a 5-star Irish pub.  Architectural Digest would be proud.  I would be happy if the food matched, especially with the above market prices.

I had the Steak and Mushroom Crock, lunch sized which is still $11.50 plus another $3 for Iced Tea that tasted like Nestea Instant.  The crock was in a French Onion Soup tureen, with a matching salad.  Not much for the money.  I forked into the crock and hunted down 3 cubes of steak which was probably about 2 ounces, and about 10 button mushrooms.  The rest was mashed potatoes and gravy.  The gravy was flavourful, but very salty.  The whole dish felt like a \"freezer to oven\" prepack serving.  Is this because MacCool's is owned by Cara Foods, the same company that caters Air Canada flights?  No excuse--Milestones is also a Cara property and it is great!

I left hungry and $15 lighter.  As I stepped out the front door and saw Chitose, releasing that for the same price I could have had AYCE Asian, with unlimited desert and drinks.  Lesson learned..."}
{"text":"Cool spot to be after work if you're in Mississauga. Atmosphere is cool and casual. Service is kind of slow but friendly. Food was okay."}
{"text":"There was a guy on a guitar playing and three songs in, a man (I'm assuming was the manager) cut him off and told him to pack his things up. It was the worst display I have seen, humiliating and embarrassing for everyone. 

The only reason I gave one star is because the bar tender was super nice and the food was ok."}
{"text":"Like the ambiance here. Good pub food. Attentive service. Would def go back"}
{"text":"Took almost 30 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were sitting at a table, only to have someone finally come and tell us to wait a moment. It was not busy whatsoever, there was no reason for us to have to wait that long. Then they delivered the wrong food to our table and tried to tell us that it was what we ordered. The food we eventually got was mediocre. Its overpriced. $53 for two meals and some waters."}
{"text":"I visited on a Sunday afternoon, Mother's day. It wasn't that busy the dining room was full however the bar was pretty empty. 

Our server was nice a little on the shy side but very attentive. 

I ordered the chicken tacos that came with chips and guac. Very filling, slightly spicy but Tasted delicious. My mother got glazed salmon. Which was tasty and light yet satisfying.

I also ordered a white sangria which tasted good but had a little too much ice and only two pieces of fruit."}
{"text":"I've reviewed a couple of Fionn MacCool's around the area and there's a reason why I keep going to them: they have some of the best pub food of any chain in the GTA. 

This one in Vaughan is no different. I wish the location was somewhere a bit more accessible for me personally, but I get it services the hotels in the area primarily. The service is great, the staff super friendly, and the food, as always, is spectacular pub grub.

It's also surprisingly kid friendly and a nice place to take a toddler for lunch, even on a weekend when there's a playoff Raptors game happening, it's not too loud, the kid's menu is great, and they have plenty of high chairs and colouring books for the wee ones.

If this one were a bit closer I'd be here every weekend. I've covered a wide range of food types on the menu and haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"This is the go-to place for me and my friends when visiting Mississauga because the food here is fan-freaking-tastic. I want to say \"for a pub\" but that really doesn't do it justice, it's just good period.

For the first time, recently, I went here during the day and had lunch and it was just as good, if not better, then our night time drinky-snacky hangouts, which prompted this review.

I could nit-pick this place a bit (the live music at night is overbearing and not my thing, it's loud enough in there as is, and I'd much rather talk to friends than hear a live band) but the service, drink selection, atmosphere and food quality totally negates any issues one might have.

Highly recommend and will be back many many more times I'm sure.

(The club sandwich with the panko-crusted peameal bacon is to DIE for FYI)"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service! They bend over backwards for you if you come with a newborn baby, offer to heat up bottles for you when you ask for hot water for the bottle, etc etc

Check on you constantly, food is great for what it is, comfort pub food, a favorite of ours whenever we take wee one to her doctor's!"}
{"text":"So far, so good!

Beautifully decorated, British-style pub. Plenty of parking. Friendly staff. Very clean, well kept. Near nightly specials. Vast menu!

I haven't tried any food there yet but I will soon! The menu itself looks great and the items that I saw and smelled coming out of the kitchen way surpassed any expectations I have for pub-grub. Next time I'm heading there hungry!"}
{"text":"To be honest - our visit to Fionn MacCool's Irish Pub wasn't the most memorable.  When we landed in Toronto we were at that weird time where it's too late for breakfast but sortof too early for lunch, plus we had our duffle bags (too early to check into our aribnb too!) and didn't want to walk toooo far.   Fionn's was one of the only places we could find downtown that was open.

So we sat, were greeted by a waitress, given glasses of water and looked over the menu.  Not sure why I did this, I must have been starving, I ordered the Chicken Pot Pie.  Bah.  That CPP was small and super dry and came w/ a super simple side salad.  It was so underwhelming. 

The restaurant is nice enough.  Lots of hightop tables.  Dark woods, big windows.  I believe there's even a patio if the weather's nice.  The restrooms were on the total opposite side of the place...and they were small, dark and not all that tidy.

There was free wifi in the restaurant!  And our waitress was lovely and made sure we always had refills... and by 12pm the place had started to fill up with the local lunch crowd.  I guess its a popular place for them, but it was certainly not my favorite place in Toronto, by the end of the trip we had found much better places to enjoy a meal at."}
{"text":"This location is a mixed bag - not that I expected much, the waitresses are fantastic, serving you up promptly and very efficiently. However, the bartender (with a Lincoln-esque beard, no moustache) is extremely douchy and will ignore any orders. 

users beware!"}
{"text":"I am still in love with this pub for lunches or after work drinks but I'm starting to become annoyed with the service.. Their menu does not offer any \"amazing\" healthy options, just plain salads. Lunch hour service is slowing down quite a bit, noticing that we are usually there for nearly 1.5 hours. And to be frank, they have this one \"regular\" server, Darci, and she is just awful. It has gotten so bad, that our entire office talks about her and avoids her section. She is just so inappropriate, rude, and doesn't make the experience pleasant at all. Go for a beer after work, but avoid Darci!"}
{"text":"I remember eating here when they first opened and being really impressed. Now I just send the food back, I couldn't believe the bad service I'd gotten when nobody else was in the restaurant."}
{"text":"I wanted to like Fionn MacCool's more that I ended up liking it. 

There menu looked very unique and a few of the items peaked my interest before deciding to visit it.  It sealed the deal for me when I learned they SHOULD award scene points as part of of the Cara group's enhanced partnership with Cineplex.   However,  to jump to the end of my experience and issue a spoiler,  scene points aren't available here because of their association with Sheraton. 

On my visit,  things were very quiet for a flames night and I had learned before hand that they position themselves as a Flames watching location.   We went mainly for food and I had the beer cheese with bread and the ragout.  The bread with beer cheese was delicious and the ragout was a little boring and probably a little light for an entree sized meal.  Overall I wouldn't have been trilled but I wouldn't have been disappointed if they took payment, issues scene points as expected and we left on our merry way.  

Unfortunately it went downhill after eating. We were told they don't take scene cards and we wished to pay with ultimate dining cards which turned this into a tailspin.  I asked to use the balance of the smallest card first and then complete payment with the larger card and add my gratuity before it finalized.   This should be simple enough.....  many resturants deal with gift cards with ease.  Most at the table with the POS system.   Here, our server had to find the manager and disappeared with my cards for well over half an hour.   We did get checked back upon by our server to be told \"one was definitely able to pay for the bill\" (not my concern... I knew this when I gave them to you)  and I figured they were hung up on being able to add the gratuity and it would be only another moment or so but not so.   The cards returned and the bill was taken out of the fill gift card leaving me with two small balanced cards (not what I asked) and they didn't let me add a gratuity after all.   Why did we wait 15+ after the bill was settled?  no printer tape.  And after all that we didn't want to leave without a gratuity and feel like jerks but we had to use a debit card which delayed us out of there even more.

So,  maybe 2 stars is harsh as it was a solid 3 food experience but I'm pretty annoyed to almost be late for my next engagement when we shouldn't have been, felt mislead by scene and added another frustrating experience to my recent memory with the Cara group using their own incentives and promotions."}
{"text":"Stopped by here after the Auto Show a few weeks ago as we were STARVING.  since it was after lunch (2pm-ish) it was half empty.  It's a huge restaurant so I can see it being quite busy later in the evening.

Ordered the beef/mushroom steak pie and the beets/lentil/kale salad with s a spicy dressing.

The beef pie was scoop every last drop delicious!  Piping hot, the gravy was lick the plate clean good, flaky crust and the mushrooms added a nice texture.  Seriously, it's simple but so good.  

The salad added a nice texture/crunch to the meal - the beets with it's sweetness and the dressing and kale with it's spiciness and bitterness.   Great compliment to the heavier meal.

Service was super friendly and our meals came out in a reasonable time.  Definitely coming back for that pie..."}
{"text":"Decent, small pub. Nothing going to blow you away inside, staff was friendly. Drink prices average (expensive) for Toronto."}
{"text":"Fionn's is a classy-looking restaurant with pretty hanging iron and stained glass lights and decorated with a lot of wood and photos of Ireland. There's quite a lot of seating and definitely good for both groups and intimate small dinners. Monday to Thursday they have daily food deals and they have live bands on the weekends. We went on a Sunday, but saw the advertising for it. 

The bartender, Amber, was very pleasant. She was very attentive and talkative. We didn't sit with an empty cup once throughout our visit. She recommended the Guinness Steak & Mushroom Pie and it was so delicious. It's an in-house made pie that is golden brown and is so flaky, stuffed with saucy button mushrooms and beautiful fall-apart, large chunks of beef. The pie is on top of a generous pile of mashed potatoes and gravy. Best pie I've ever had. My boyfriend ate a good portion of my plate and loved it, and he hates mushrooms. He ordered the Blarney Fries, which is crispy lattice fries smothered in a tasty \"kick'd up ale\" cheese sauce, diced tomatoes, green onions and jalapeños. It was awesome and is apparently the house staple here. 

We will be coming back here for sure. Great food, great service, great experience. I'm considering bringing my family here for my birthday."}
{"text":"First time here was great. Sat with my parents here in the bar a few nights ago for dinner we were treated great, food was nice and service was fast. 

Today for lunch was a whole other story. They wouldn't take a reservation in advance for a group of 6 women, one of which (my mother) was celebrating her birthday. 

They told us to come either before 12pm or after 2pm to avoid the Friday afternoon lunch rush. We arrived at 1:45, though didn't order our drinks until after 2pm and it took 20mins to get our first round of drinks, despite the fact that we were one of the only tables in the dining room. 

Our first (female) server was very attentive, though we must have hit right at a shift change. Our second (male) server was really poor though: out of touch with customer service. One of our party asked if the latke grilled cheese was meant to be the way it was (extremely hard, teeth-breaking crunchy and way over cooked). And he said yes (!) which we all knew it was not. We didn't want to send it back, and he did after a few minutes offer to get her something else, but it really should have been right away!

The food overall was pretty poor. My mother really enjoyed her cod sandwich and burgers were just ok, but potatoe latke grilled cheeses for 3 women were not enjoyed.

Manager was too busy hanging streamers on the wall to be concerned when she overheard us bringing up the cooking issues to our server. 

We also had to pay for the birthday dessert we ordered as a surprise, which we've never experienced at such an establishment before.

Overall, most of our party remarked they will not be coming back. We all love this chain in other locations, but this Newmarket location is seriously lacking in some major areas. 

Hoping these get fixed as there are a couple of us hoping for a better experience next time."}
{"text":"This is about the smallest Fionns you'll ever find. We stop in here from time to time before the Bull and Firkin. The food is good and there's a solid selection of beer and whiskeys. The size is a bit of a problem. The TVs in the pub aren't well laid out, mainly because the ceiling lights hang down and block the view from many angles. The washrooms are also a problem, with one stall for the men only, so after a few pops men give up waiting and go into the women's. Overall, it's a cozy place. Recommended."}
{"text":"Very bad experince. If your looking for a place that you have to walk through 10 people smoking and yelling at each other and a security guard just to get in the front door this is your place.
The bar tender/server smelled like a pack of smokes in water. We ordered there  type on notchoes less jalapeño and of course it came with them. took the back for a re-make, took only 2 mins  as they only picked them off we could still taste and found them on the bottom , server lied!!! So over all VERY BAD EXPERIENCE! 
\"WE WILL TAKE IT OFF THE BILL\" will not save  customers."}
{"text":"Good food.
Attentive staff.

Great location.
Dude, stop by for a drink and watch the city become alive or just drop in for a tasty lunch on your way to the park.  

Very good."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday Night with my daughter. Read the reviews, it wasn't very busy so thought we'd give its chance 

Ordered the Fish and Chips. One word: YUM!  There was a side of gravy with my fries that was the tastiest gravy I've had in a while. 

My daughter had the Maple Glazed Salmon and raved about how mouth watering it was. She LOVED their rice and polished it all off 

The decor was typical Irish pub and clean. I was pleasantly surprised at how well priced everything was. Service was friendly and just the right level of attentive

I'll make this place a regular stop on my Oakville visits."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here recently before heading out to a concert. The place is deceptively small! The front serves as a tiny drinking lounge and in the back, there are larger tables for sit down dinner. The bar rail is a bit small but it's actually well laid out. I ordered a mac & cheese which was a gourmet above KD diner. It was actually very tasty. My friend ordered fish & chips which were not greasy. What I liked best is the beer list and more importantly, the fact that they serve Samuel Adams."}
{"text":"The place had some good deal on beer, and had a live band. But don't go for the food. It so so."}
{"text":"We had great service, although the food took a long time to arrive.  I had a delicious Rosslare Lamb Shank.  Fall-off-the-bone goodness.  And they made a proper layered Black & Tan.  The band was extremely talented, too."}
{"text":"Not all Fionn MacCool's are created equal. This one is pretty dead on a Saturday night. It's a small establishment. And the food seems to have gotten worse."}
{"text":"We were meaning to try this location and weren't disappointed.  The servers were friendly and helpful.  There were great choices on the menu. We're definitely coming back again. It helps to have reservations. 
Cheers"}
{"text":"Came here with a friend who absolutely loves the place. First thing I noticed is that this place is... like, really dark. This isn't unheard of for pubs, but it was so dark that I could barely read the menu even though there were tea lights on the tables... Thankfully no glaring problems in service. We weren't super hungry so we ordered two appetizers: blarney chips and a poutine with short ribs. The blarney chips were delicious, but the poutine left me wanting more. I expected more flavour from the Guinness gravy, but it didn't really deliver."}
{"text":"I always head over here when I want a nice pub feel but without driving all the way downtown. They have great staff! 
Good list of drinks, and best of all..the lamb pie! This is the most delicious thing I have had in a long time. Every single time it tastes just as good. 
Whenever their patio is open, I love being there. Nice peaceful environment."}
{"text":"Brutal experience. Waitress said she wasn't allowed to verbally list off all their beer on tap, then after we ordered our food told us they were closing (because some guys were in the back who needed to fix the floors), although she said she 'wasn't rushing us', of course we felt rushed."}
{"text":"We had the steak snd mushroom pie and the Shepard's pie. Both were obviously microwaved, food was hot in some places and cold in others. Salad had too much dressing and the beer on tap was not cold enough   ugh....won't be back."}
{"text":"Great Pub food.  not huge portions like other irish pubs, but decent.  Check for the daily deal before ordering.  Pies are good but small.  I like Irish pubs when they give you tons of food!.  the salad is great here and the service is great.  not that busy!"}
{"text":"Had kronenburg blanc and stella because I couldn't get my first choice(s) -- Friday night and they're out of beers?  Apparently it's a common theme here..

Fish&chips seemed formed -- I was expecting properly-battered fish, not fish sticks."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Fionn MacCools location. The food is always spot on and the staff is great!

There isn't much more to say. Coming here is a safe bet."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere with average food. They're known Best for their fish and chips, we tried it in two varieties: sirachi and sandwich format. Both were average. Drinks here are very good, with lots of unique choices on draught. I had a Spicey Caesar and it was perfect. I'd visit this restaurant again if a) it was most convenient (ie. staying in the attached hotel) or b) looking to go have a few drinks and watch a game. I wouldnt visit this restaurant if I was looking for an exceptional culinary experience."}
{"text":"Great bar, great atmosphere. They were amazing when I booked a table for the night of ten people and only three showed up. They treated me really well. The only thing I didn't like was that I was in the far front of the bar and the music was very loud to a point where I couldn't even hear the person in front of me. We left right after that happened. Wasn't impressed with that"}
{"text":"First time coming here and it was awesome like the service was great and the food was amazing and I had pasta with chicken and it's a great place for group party and you will have a awesome experience:)  high  recommend!!"}
{"text":"I had the misfortune of coming here on a busy day when they were severely understaffed. We waited 20 minutes just to get a menu.  After we ordered they brought ketchup and mustard bottles to the table. The ketchup was empty, but with no server in sight, we didn't bother waiting to eat our fries. The same scenario applied to extra napkins, refills, etc.

In spite of almost no service, the food ( once it came ) was reasonably good. It was pretty standard pub fare. On the day I was there, they had a brunch menu, as well as a lunch menu. Brunch included things like French toast, eggs Benedict, etc. Expect above average food at prices typical for this type of chain. Hopefully you will get served!"}
{"text":"A regular bar with the typical pub options. The food is freshly made and everyone was happy with their lunch orders (there was a slight mix up but our server fixed it will little hassle). Service was friendly and efficient. The crowd seems like older men there for a beer and to watch sports.  A serviceable bar for our lunch needs. 

As we were leaving, they put up signs for cover charges due to a fight that night. So this place must get bust at times!"}
{"text":"Nice decent place, great music, good service and a lively atmosphere. What else do you want at a place like this at 10.30 pm on a Friday. Have to admit, the nachos, with the crinkle cut fries were awesome. Loaded with flavour and toppings. This takes nachos to a whole new level. And the Sangria was perfect. Also, the crowd is mature, compared to the Lion Pub, which is not bad, however, seems like a first choice for teens (or young adults). 
Will definitely come here again for a great date nite again."}
{"text":"Don't order Poutine at an Irish pub. Lesson learnt. 

Other than that, this location is close to my place in Mississauga and a perfect place to catch a game. We did FIFA 2014 here... and boy was it fun! Just the perfect amount of crowd watching in togetherness on a big-ass projector screen! 

Beer's beer. Cocktails not so much. They didn't rim my margarita with salt. Upon my request, I received a beyond sloppy rim on it. Foodwise - the calamari kind of sucked as well. My boyfriend enjoyed his entrees though - steak and a pound of wings (yes, he ordered both.)

Rating: Meh!
Verdict: *shrug*"}
{"text":"Mixed emotions: That's how this place makes me feel.

I came here for lunch and drinks 4 times and had amazing food and really great service.  The Shrimp cakes are really delicious and turned me onto Hot Banana peppers, which I always thought tasted like jalepeno's but they actually are more like vinegary, sweet, slightly pungent bell peppers.

I went in  the other day, met some lovely people, and was having fun. I ordered a cod sandwich and was happily muching away. I was enjoying it - and I'm not a  huge seafood fan - unfortunately, when my sandwich got near the end and fell apart -  a long hair was apparent on my plate.  A long, black gross nasty hair that made me want to vomit. I swear to freaking GOD I have this worst luck with this! Even got a hair in my pizza when ordering takeout from Pizza Hut only 1 week earlier! Ugh. Anyway, The manager had left (like no one was there but customers) and the meal was free (buy 4, get one free), so I just stopped eating. I should have said something, but I often wonder what's the point?

Anyway, beers are cheap $5.50 for every pint until 6pm on weekdays (including Blanche de chamblay and other pricey brands) and the staff are pretty nice (although seems they've lost some girls lately.

Just please PLEASE!! MAKE YOUR STAFF WEAR HAIRNETS AND DOUBLE CHECK EVERY PLATE FOR QUALITY CONTROL."}
{"text":"The cocktail list here is interesting & unique. However, it's been very hit or miss when I've tried new drinks... And I absolutely hate their ceaser. Not sure if it was the particular bartender that day or of it was their recipe but it tasted horrible! I always order the chicken sandwich. It's fantastic. I've also had the beet salad, wings, curry dishes and a few other items that have slipped my mind. All delicious. All of the apps I've tried have been too greasy for my liking but considering its an Irish pub it's exactly what to expect. 
This place is walkable from my house & a convenient , affordable place to go in heartland area. Although, their apps may be very greasy/pub-like they have a lot of options on their menu that stray from your typical pub food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, was not very full at that time. The dishes we ordered were average, nothing special that would bring me back.

Our server was great however, she allowed us to sample two beers before we ordered full glasses of beer."}
{"text":"2.5/5
Came here last night with a large group of friends.  Our server was nice but barely waited on us. 2 hrs into dinner service she finally came back to get our food orders (and we did tell her we'd be ordering food after we received our drinks). The food was sub par. Nothing special at all. I think the best thing at our table was this burger with avocado and the chicken wings. I ordered the Wednesday special - 1 piece fish and chips. The fish was flavourless and the batter was soggy and I shared a calamari appetizer with a friend. The portions are huge but again the food is blahhhhh. It was all so blahhhhh!"}
{"text":"Fionn MacCool's is a traditional try-to-be-Irish pub.  Being located downtown, in a relatively high-end hotel, and being in Eau Claire, they are not a cheap Irish pub.  They definitely cater more towards the well-to-do types.

With that said, it is a really nice place and the service is really good.  I've been a few times, usually with work colleagues, and sat on their patio a handful of times.  In my experience though, the food is not great and they don't do a great job of trying to be authentic.  That could be a good or bad thing, but personally I like my fake Irish pubs to keep up appearances.  But that's just me.

Being in Eau Claire, they are not cheap.  I imagine their lease isn't cheap either though, so I wouldn't say they are out to rob anybody.  But it is a good choice for drinks after work, or if you're trying to woo a lady but want to keep it somewhat casual.  At the end of the day though, there are better choices nearby that are not a hotel bar."}
{"text":"I ate here with a couple of my girls. It's a new restaurant in Crossiron Mills in the entertainment section. I had this fear that it was like Boston Pizza, but it was nothing like it. The same price, but better quality. Their menu looked GREAT! I ordered the Guinness Burger and boy, was it a big burger! For 15 bucks! The service was great, the food was great. I recommend this over Boston Pizza, especially since they're right across from each other in the mall.

The only complaint I have about this place is the shortness of the skirts. I'm not a concerned parent or anything haha I'm a young woman enjoying a night out, but I wasn't a fan of seeing the bottom of one girls buttcheeks over and over again during the wait and the meal. Other than that, great place! Probably my new crossiron joint!"}
{"text":"Actually, I don't really drink and I've only been here once, but it was a positive experience. Was here on Labour day with some close friends and ordered some drinks. The place was mostly empty that you could easily hear the background music. Atmosphere was quaint (peaceful for downtown Toronto) and staff were friendly.

I doubt it is always like this, but it is really chill here. You can order some drinks and food. I shared a poutine, good but nothing special."}
{"text":"On a street full of chain restaurants, Fionn MacCool's has opened up in the massive Costco, Zellers, Superstore plaza in a location long occupied by Casey's. I often stopped by Casey's for a mid-shopping beer break and maybe a burger. It was run down, had a number of barflies but I was always satisfied, especially by the veteran bartender who always made you feel welcome.
So I gave Fionn's a shot. I know the downtown locations well enough, and wasn't surprised by my experience. While they have maintained the old Casey's layout, they have put some money into the conversion. For some odd reason there were no changes made in the washroom, save for a couple Irish-themed pics.
Had the prime rib burger with salad. It was cooked med well with a touch of pink remaining. I enjoyed the seasoning on the burger, and the standard crispy onion straws are a great touch. Who enjoys those powerful raw onions anyways? The salad was cold, crisp and a perfect compliment.
The Guinness was cold and fresh, the service was great. They do the whole \"What's your name, Love?\" thing so that the food runner calls you by name etc. I'm ok with that. 
I was intrigued by their current Wednesday night promo: $19.99 gets you a Mini Keith's keg at your table, about 6 pints worth. Not a bad deal."}
{"text":"My review is based on two, back-to-back visits to Fionn MacCool's. Our first night was stellar. We had terrific service and had such a hard time deciding on what to eat! We settled on a small order of poutine, a bowl of seafood chowder and a beet salad - all to share. I have to say that seafood chowder was probably the best I've ever had. Rich, creamy, packed full of sweet seafood - yummy to the last drop. It was so good, we had to go back the second night for a re-match. We opted to not only chow down on the chowder but also sample the seafood pie. This is where it all went downhill. The chowder was okay, but the seafood pie was not at all what I expected. The seafood was bland; the sauce was liquid and runny with no flavor at all and the pastry was tough. I sent it back and while the management comped the meal, I was really surprised that no one - the server or the manager - asked if they could bring me something else! I thought that strange. And I was a little tiffed, too, because I was hungry. So I guess my final decision on MacCool's is it's just okay. You may get lucky with what you order or you may end up leaving hungry like I did. Have a pint of Guinness, though, and it won't bug you as much."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, staff very friendly! The brownie dessert just hit the spot...warm brownies with a chocolate caramel drizzle... Just melts in your mouth... Was all gone before I could snap a pic. Looks like I gotta make another visit... Who's up for dessert???"}
{"text":"Fionn MacCool's has always struck me as completely embodying a hotel bar. The prices are jacked way up for the business travellers with expense accounts, as are the drinks. It has a certain fax-irish veneer, with dark wood decoration, guiness on tap and some irish dishes in the menu, but it still remains a hotel bar. That being said, it is the last to fill up after events held on Princes Island Park, or in the mall nearby, and that makes up about 90% of my experiences.

The meat pie is decent, the guiness expensive, the service prompt and succint for people on a deadline. It is a business bar wrapped in irish style paper, but its not bad overall."}
{"text":"Wicked salad.
Haha, I know, I know - I went to an Irish Pub and had a salad.  But it was soooo good!
Spinach, strawberries, spicy almonds, goat cheese, added chicken - fresh and filling!
But on the \"not so light side\", we ordered Beer Bread for our appy and it was amazing.  Deep fried biscuit-like dough chunks served with a \"knock your knickers off\" cheese sauce.
Oh, and of course the beer is cold and delish too (but I'm betting you knew that already)"}
{"text":"Staying at the \"Element\" hotel across the parking lot..a very quick walk makes this place really handy.

Irish themed pub with a multitude of beers on tap and very pleasant waitresses to serve them.

I had Salmon for dinner ...and for pub food, wow, really good! 

For a new place ...and on a Tuesday night, pretty busy!  

If you are in the area I don't think you can go wrong.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Service was very good.  Food was passable, but I'd return to partake of more beer suggestions of the waitress as they were spot on."}
{"text":"Me and a few friends ordered Somersby Mojitos and substituted the rum for vodka. Amazing!!!!! We just came back from Pizza Fest so we didn't get a chance to order any food but we did get some dessert (Apple pie Crumble with vanilla ice cream...:. I think haha) sooooo good. To top it off I left my purse there and had to come back the next day and everything was accounted for and the staff was really sweet. Great atmosphere , good food and awesome staff! Thought I posted this already but I forgot to hit continue!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for fish and chips in the city! I love Haddock and Chips and this pub does it really well.  I like almost  everything I have tried, but I keep going back to the fish and chips. They are crispy, not soggy, with great flavor. It comes with tarter sauce, and coleslaw. You can get yam fries, gravy or onion rings for an extra charge.

The one day that I got a piece of fish that I didn't like, they quickly replaced it for me. No questions asked.

On a cool day, I also like to start with the French Onion soup. It has such a deep flavor. I love it, but I like to share it with my friends as soup and fish and chips is quite filling.

Service is generally quick, though it can be loud, especially during a televised game. I have always been able to find a table, even when it's busy. 

They do take interact, but it's at the bar, not tableside. You can park underground at Eau Claire for $2.00 and walk over. Or park on the street.

Great food, great atmosphere. I love this place :)"}
{"text":"As a regular restaurant goer (10-12 x Month)...I've come to anticipate a certain level of food/service from Toronto area restaurants. This restaurant delivered neither! This Fionn MacCools Rest was terrible. Our waitress argued with us over the food quality & stated that \"Yelp means nothing\"! We had the Blarney Fries which were cold & undercooked the 1st time around & not nearly hot enough the 2nd time. Also ordered the Warm Mushroom salad w Chicken. This was tasteless & bland. My wife had the Beet Salad which had only a trace of Beets. This was a totally unimpressive restaurant that does not deserve to have us spend our hard earned dollars at!! Avoid...avoid...avoid!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of pubs and I'm always willing to visit different ones.  I've been there last Saturday and found the place very nice, even being in a large group. 

They seem to have only one TV and where I was sitting I wasn't able to see it - this, for me, is a bonus. I hate the guy who had the idea of putting TVs in bars - I go out with my friends for chatting and fun, I can watch my own TV at home. So, Fionn MacCools is a very nice place for hanging with your friends, going on a date, whatever, because the TV won't steal your partners attention. 

The food is very good and comes in reasonable portions. I ordered a Guinness Poutine and could share it with my husband. I strongly recommend the only Bailey's cocktail they offer, the name is something like Irish Cold Coffee Lalala I Can't Recall. Very good.

Oh, very important: they have an ATM right at the door. You won't be out of money at late night! 

I'm not giving five stars because I prefer more old-fashioned pubs. But I strongly recommend this one."}
{"text":"Just got turned away at 8:40 on New year's day! Very dissapointing.  Drove 20 minutes to come here.  Posted that closed at 9pm and there were people eating.  Used to be a favorite spot for our family.  What a shame as I will chose differently in future."}
{"text":"I've only been here twice and it's impressed me each time! So many drinks to choose from and their food is amazing! I've never had food this good at a pub. I had the steak which came with fries and onion rings. Onion rings were soo good it just melted in my mouth! Steak was cooked perfectly. Bf had the prime rib burger which he thought was the best burger he's ever had! And he's a picky guy! Our second
Visit we only had a few drinks and ordered (forgot the name) waffle fries with cheese
Sauce and jalapeños oooommmmggggg best munchies ever! Overall I loved it, good atmosphere great food. Only thing I would change is the price but hey, I can't say it wasn't worth the $$"}
{"text":"This place is excellent for meeting up with friends and hang out for an hour or a few. It is very clean for a pub, the atmosphere is very chill, and the staff is cool. They have live music on some nights (I'm not a big fan, as I don't like it too loud, BUT if you sit at the other end of the place, the music is just at the right volume).  

Now to the menu. The Blarney Chips are a must have! They are basically a gourmet version of Fries Supreme. Very very yummy. The Prime Rib burger is awesome, and I love their Chicken Tikka Masala Boxty. Its a potatoe pancake with delicious Chicken Curry sauce and a bit of sour cream. It is not very spicy, so ask for extra spice! LOVE IT.

I should probably stop writing these reviews when I'm hungry...because now I want some :("}
{"text":"Not sure if they changed management or cooking staff but I have been back a few times this summer and food quality has gone downhill. Undercooked chicken, half the toppings on their nachos and sandwiches, changed to processed cheese... it's a real shame. This used to be a favorite spot."}
{"text":"Visited here on a Saturday afternoon before a sporting event. The food was good but our two servers seemed to hate their lives."}
{"text":"Long story short - sweet pub, lively atmosphere, great food! 

I get it - this pub is a chain restaurants. It's expected to have a few hiccups during opening month but I'd have to say, they ironed them out relatively fast. With chain restaurants come generic food and okay service, but not here! I've been to this location 3 times now since October 31st & I LOVE it. Their drinks are creative and moderately priced. The entertainment scene is decent, seen two live bands rockin' the stage. And the most important part and reason why you're reading this review; the food. The food was so flippin' good. I've had the bread pudding, the Irish nachos, the cod sandwich, mixed green salad & the seafood pie. I can honestly say the pies are where it's at. The crust is made in house, flakey and crispy. A shrimp piece was in every bite! EVERY BITE. I loved the flavor and the strong asparagus taste. The veggies weren't mushy inside and each flavor was really apparent. My second favourite was the cod sandwich. The fish is crispy, the slaw pairs well and the bun was pretty good too. A bit messy so bring your napkins. The only thing that threw me off was the plating scheme. It was served on a wooden board which was totally unique, although, it made me conscious of how messy I really am. 

Service is good and attentive. A longer than average wait for drinks on Friday/Saturday night, but that's expected. 

My one and only gripe was the leaky ceiling from poor builders.

Fionn MacCools is the facelift Newmarket's been dying to get."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely bland. We had the tacos that were smothered in hot sauce (the only flavour in that meal) and the chicken club was terrible! Despite the food tasting like cardboard, the drink menu was great. A great place to grab drinks - but food? No thanks."}
{"text":"First time there since the renovation. 
The new look is very inviting but it still has a cold dark feeling. 

We had the calamari and pickles to start. But the pickles were old and a bit brown under the flower. ( the server took them away but explained they were her favorite)
The calamari however was amazing. Huge pieces! ( appys were a bit expensive too)- prices aren't listed online.. 

The fish and chips were ok. Fries tasted fresh cut- But the butter chicken boxty was anazing!! Low price too! It also came with a side. 

Id go back!"}
{"text":"We had supper this evening at Fionn MacCool's.

It was a busy spot and there was a waiting list!

Gord ordered Fish & Chips.  He said it was excellent and he'd get it again.

I hadn't eaten all day so was hungry.  I had the BBQ Half Chicken (I didn't want any salad and I had the fries replaced with mashed potatoes).  It too was delicious and I'd get it again.

I ordered Apple Crumble Pie for dessert and it was really good.

There were three staff together greeting customers at the door or chatting with each other.  As the place was jammed and the servers were really busy, one or two of them should have been helping out (there was no need to have three greeters at the door since there was a waiting list)."}
{"text":"A relatively real Irish pub.

I ordered a boxty and I found it didn't taste too authentic.  I don't know what is authentic, since I'd never been to Ireland and ordered a boxty - assuming boxty's originate from Ireland.

The gravy just tasted too plain.

The beer was good though!

Expensive here too .. perhaps related to location."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife on our way through town. We had some gift cards which worked at a variety of places and as we don't have a many options back in Lethbridge.  

Cross Iron had both this and Milestones and after looking over both menus we picked here as we just came off a week of vegetarian eating and this place had a lot of fish options. 

I picked the southern bake.  It was good and pretty much what you'd expect from pub food.  The taste was a bit flat which they attempted to pump up with a spicy sauce but I would have preferred a bit more spices to balance as it was more peppery than I prefer.  That said they grilled the lemon which was a very nice touch.  The fries we ordinary but good. 

My wife had the fish tacos which she seemed to like but the chips that came with it weren't great at all


The decor was fun and festive and our waitress was good."}
{"text":"We walked InTo this place with a mall scooter.  The second lady said no no I am not sure if we allow those 'things' in here!  My wife did not want to be in the scooter any way.  We just left after that episode!  Not welcoming at all.  We are next door at Milestone's and they are very accommodating.  I will take it up with restaurant management, and mall management.  Do they not serve certain ethnicities?  Obviously not the disabled!  Or blind, deaf, or First Nations?  Train your staff better!  This is 2018!"}
{"text":"Not the best choice for dinner on a Saturday night. Service was very slow although they only had 2 wait staff working the tables.  Got there about 6:30 and left about 8pm. Took ages for our food and it didn't appear that busy. At 8pm they turned the lights down very low in the entire place so it was a good thing we had already paid by that point ( or I wouldn't have been able to see the bill!)

We ordered Shepherds Pie Yorkies to start and they were excellent - comes with four so it was good for sharing. Then we waited a very long time for our meals - salads and a pasta. The Cobb salad was tasty and they were able to substitute the blue cheese with goat cheese. It was a little on the small side and not worth the wait. The chicken fettuccine was excellent and the apple crumble was a tasty dessert. 

Not sure we will be back - time to explore some other dining options in Clarkson."}
{"text":"Nothing like hitting up the ol' Irish roots with a brew and a band."}
{"text":"Yes it's a chain - but a pretty good one. At least this particular location is quite decent and nice to visit. Clean, cool, working well.

Service is rather chaotic at time, but generally positive and pleasant to deal with. Food is okay - nothing especially bad, neither anything to die for. I tried different plates and was usually satisfied with quality of food.

Portion size is okay (4/5 actually, but still good enough to keep that belly round and happy). Drinks list is not that ample, but variety is present, so you should not be bored - at least for the first couple of visits. Wine menu looks a bit better than a beer one, which is funny.

Rogers Centre is just around the block - which means you can drop in before or after the game or show. Or rather \"may attempt to\", as the game days tend to be busy. :-)

Overall - not bad at all. I can imagine inviting someone for a drink at MacCools, passing through the zone. Though it will not be a \"special\" place to go, just a usual one."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this bar.  No matter the location.  Their beer and food specials are unheard of (2 pints for 10 dollars??? more than 5 beers to choose from for the special? SOLD!)

Just an example, I got a pint of barking squirrel at Jack astors for 10 dollars.  I then met my friends at Fionn's and got the same pint of Squirrel for 5 dollars.  AND they have way better food than Jack Astors.  

Go try the Blarney chips.  It's nachos with all the toppings, but with waffle fries instead of hard stale nachos."}

{"text":"So far... off to a poor start.  Asked hostess if there were any Friday Specials... she said \"I don't know, ask your server\".  Yet the daily specials are posted on a menu board in the Washroom! You'd think that being a hostess, she would at least know that!!

Waitress comes to take drink order and had zero personality - she couldn't get away from the table fast enough.  It's been 5 mins and there are only 5 tables in the dining area, but no sign of our drinks or our waitress... HMMM.
 
8 mins...drinks here and food order taken.  Food arrived 12 mins later.  Ordered typical \"pub fare\" fish n chips.  Coleslaw was exceptional.  Fries average,  fish - decent portion.  Nothing beyond average to the taste.   Table check came AFTER I was finished eating.  Made hint that I was looking for the bill... but still waiting for her to come back.

Finally came back - antiquated system for paying.

Overall - not the best and certainly not the type of service and food quality you'd expect with the amount of competition around them.  I'd go back for beers and wings maybe...but not for a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"We were hung over and looking for a place that served brunch until 3 pm that would not be crowded on a Sunday. And the neighborhood Cora's had a long line. So we ventured to this place. 

Nice atmosphere and not crowded surprisingly, we even got a booth. Service was good. 

Coffee was mediocre but free refills. 
I has the eggs Benny on a cheese scone with a salad on the side. My friend got the same but she had the home fries on the side that I sampled. They were good but a bit sweetened which was new for my taste buds. My frd's husband had the breakfast poutine without the bacon or eggs and said it was just ok. Our eggs Benny were edible but there was something a bit unsatisfying about them. Perhaps it was how small the scone was and how dry scones can sometimes be? I ate every bite plus the fruit skewer garnish which was a nice touch. 

Tons of screens to watch sports on and fun to people watch those that are walking on Front St. It was the Monster Jam so lots of suburbanites around on Front St taking their kids. 

I'd probably only go back if hung over again (but I'd try something other than eggs Benny) or to watch sports and drink beer as the location is convenient from my friend's place."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer and a burger. Staff is friendly and quick. Close to home for me and to downtown. Been a few times and have really enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Just made it to Canada !! Me and some friends decided to grab some quick late dinner and it was pretty tasty . Loved it !! I Just picked up wings :). The waiter could have paid us more attention :) but it was a nice peaceful time here . Late =empty"}
{"text":"One of my favourite \"go-to\" date spots! The chicken pie is life changing good. It is usually paired with plain spinach and mushrooms which doesn't appeal to me at all so I substitute for mashed potatoes at no charge or sweet potato fries for 3$ extra. 

They recently changed their calamari from the rings with a red pepper jam (oh how I miss that jam! **insert mouth watering here) to strips of calamari served with some kind of chipotle mayo I think. 

I can tell you honestly the new calamari is so damn delicious you won't ever need to dip it anywhere. If you order them extra crispy/well done you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Good times had by all, the craft beer special Thursday was a nice bonus, the service was friendly, the food was tasty and the atmosphere was wide open, but still had a homely feel. 

There aren't too many Irish pubs in the Vaughan area, and this one tops all nearby. The mini Yorkshire puddings are awesome. Once I realized this was owned by the same corporation as D'Arcy McGee's, which I visited in Ottawa, I had to get them for the wife to try out. The burgers were cooked well and were juicy and filling. The gravy on the poutine wasn't too bad and it even tasted like they used real cheese. I tried the avocado bacon burger which was a great choice, but even though there were good portions of avocado it really was over powered by the bacon. Filling and a nice compliment to the $5 pints of Steam Whistle. 

I would definitely be back and recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. Really can't go wrong. I have been here a few times. Slowly making my way thru the menu. Lol.  I have been pretty darn impressed so far. They just do it so well, covering typical pub must haves from fish and chips to French onion soup, and everything in between. In my opinion, they shine and set themselves apart by putting a twist on your staple dishes. Their Calamari and the signature blarney chips are my all-time favs. 
Great place with friends and or if you just want to catch the game. They always have something on. Big screens. Many screens. 
Best pub in Mississauga?!!! I think so!"}
{"text":"My brother and I ended up here twice during his visit to Toronto. We were looking for a laid back pub with a decent selection of food and beers.

The food was pretty decent but a bit heavy (which is to be expected for this sort of pub). The service was surprisingly kind and personalized. We had two different women and they were kind and amusing. The beer section is decent enough and the atmosphere is great.

There isn't much else to say. This place is solid and has live music to boot! Definitely a great place to grab a casual beer at the end of a long week."}
{"text":"In Toronto for a few days from New York and too cold to walk. Came in and ordered the chicken sandwich and substituted for Irish chips. Not bad at all. Recommend this place is not into the \"busy\" scene."}
{"text":"Came here a while ago and I remember trying the roti which was pretty good.
Think it was on the expensive side, though. But seeing how it's in a nice area and on bloor street I guess that's expected.

very convenient for the people working at Manulife. I guess that's where most of there customers come from"}
{"text":"The service started out good and kind of got progressively slower despite it not being that busy. The food was kind of bland and for the price I just think it's not worth it. Although I will say I enjoyed the live music."}
{"text":"I had never been to a Fionn MacCool's before this visit, but I had heard good things. Well, those things were all proven true! 
A really warm and inviting Irish Pub, although it's brand spanking new, it still has a nice comforting ambience.

The staff was extremely friendly and made good, honest recommendations. I tried an appetizer that I can't remember the name of (Dublin chips?) but it was basically lattice cut fries with nacho toppings. YUM. Talk about fast service too - I think we only waited 5-10 mins for it to come to the table after ordering. The rest of the menu had regular Irish pub fare. 

The piece de resistance - RED VELVET DONUTS. Oh my gosh - these are like warm crispy soft donuts from heaven. You get four freshly made donuts with white chocolate sauce to pour over them. WHITE CHOCOLATE SAUCE!!! They smelled like birthday and happiness. I would go back every day for the donuts alone. They are THAT good!!

I'll have to come back to check out their live music which they have Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Yay for Live Music venues!! :)"}
{"text":"Its Ok. Its just a regular bar. Go early though, I've been a handful of times only to walk right out due to no seating. 

Their burgers are \"made in house\"...Pfftt... not really. They are certainly frozen burgers.... ANYWAYS.... Get their lattice fries. Those are pretty good. 

Other then that, its a generic watering hole"}
{"text":"Everything was just ok.  I went to the washroom and the toilet exploded on me. I got so wet, I was appalled . I told the manager and she blamed it on me. \"We'll I'm sorry that you experienced that but I locked those washrooms!\"   Um okay but I went in and this is what happened.  I was soakened my wet! Cold and uncomfortable!  Can't believe they downplayed this, I don't care if a Plummer is coming, I'm wet and cold! You don't think a sign would be helpful??"}
{"text":"I've had lunch here too many times for it to be acceptable because of the location is so close to my office. The patio is lovely, and the service is quite quick despite the lunchtime rush with everyone from the nearby office buildings flocking here for a midday pick-me-up.

The food has improved a lot since last year, but the quality of the dishes are still pretty inconsistent. The shepherd's pie was the worst of the bunch, with the ground meat (beef? sheep?) swimming in a pool of grease and defrosted vegetable water. The Blarney Chips is also really strange tasting, and the only comparison I can draw is that the waffle fries taste a little bit like cleaning supplies (at least you know that the food is clean) This taste doesn't apply to the other Fionn location on Front St., so the taste of bleach and Windex is exclusive to this location.

There are definite winners on the menu, however, and the tikki masala is quite filling and delicious. Definitely not authentic by any means, but it's pretty tasty according to my unfamiliar-with-real-Indian-cuisine taste buds. The chicken pie is also really good: piping hot and fluffy crust. Mmmmm.

I know I'm going to come back for a cider and some pie again during lunch or a quick drink after work, so this place is a little more than A-OK, but the inconsistent experiences does not make me want to be a fan."}
{"text":"An unassuming pub tucked within the Sheraton complex near Eau Claire, I was pleasantly surprised by the low-key and warm atmosphere inside. Guinness was on special - Guinness I had! I was also pretty hungry after work so I got a Guinness burger (because why not); a huge patty with some kind of Guinness-soaked cheese, roasted peppers and sauteed mushrooms. It was perfectly juicy and the ingredients weren't the typical stand-bys.

It was a great opportunity to sit back and relax with some of my favorite people in a (somewhat) quiet setting: the radio was on and playing a fantastic selection of old hits that went beyond the usual rock radio staples. Animotion's \"Obsession\", the 12-inch extended version?? Yes please! I would come back here anytime.

{"text":"This was my first time at an irish pub/restaurant. I'm sad to say it was a pretty crappy experience. 

We ordered the Blarney fries ($14) and the Rover Bites ($10).  Blarney fries were like still white (not fried long enough). And for some reason they were kinda warm rather than hot. We were the only people in the restaurant at like 3pm, so I'm not sure how they managed to pull off the \"kind of warm\" food.

The cheese they put on top is like Cheez Whiz...very low quality stuff that comes out of your fridge. Then it was loaded with a buncha crap they chopped up and threw on top. You can make the stuff at home (and a better well prepared version) but then again you wouldn't want to.

The rover bites were interesting. At least I would recommend this one.

The waitress took forever to come take our order and then for us to pay when we were literally the only customers in the restaurant."}
{"text":"We stopped into this location today around 11:30, even though I could think of many other places in Brampton I would rather go. 

Given that we were totally starving, we ordered an appetizer with lunch... not a normal occurrence. We got the bread with beer cheese. Which was actually quite delicious and made me want to try making something similar at home. My issue with that dish was dirty plating with the cheese. It looked a total mess. 

We both got the Guinness steak and mushroom pies. The pies came out looking delicious and were fresh and piping hot. The accompanying mashed potatoes were lukewarm and the Guinness gravy was cold. All together the dish was truly delicious. I just wish it had been a consistent temperature all the way through. Another noticeable issue was the lack of mushrooms in the steak and mushroom pie. I'm not talking not enough mushrooms, I'm talking NONE. 

I do, however, like Fionn MacCools so I know that I will be returning. With slightly adjusted expectations."}
{"text":"Went to eat at this place for a work party. I chose something on the menu called rover bites, and unfortunately these little things sent me to the bathroom at 3:00am in  the morning. I'm just warning anyone who wants to try the rover bites from there, it will send you to the toilet. Other than that, the atmosphere was nice and everyone else's food looked awesome and tasty."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant! We've had fish & chips, Shepherd's Pie & Chicken Pie & all were great. Very friendly service and good prices. We're going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff that makes this place tick! 
Good beers and great food . Try the blarney chips and you wouldn't want anything else !"}
{"text":"My boyfriend wanted to come here for drinks. We got their 5 dollar house special. It was alright. Can't really complain because we got what we paid for. 

I think it was Bud. It tasted like bananas, like subtle hints of bananas. 

I really like the atmosphere of the pub, the two female servers were very outgoing and chatty. They were super quick, friendly and constantly kept checking up on us which was nice. My bf kept changing his mind about food and then finally we ordered food. 

The buffalo nachos were okay. That is my opinion since I'm not a huge fan of nachos to begin with. But I remember having their waffle fries which were amazing, I should have ordered that instead. 

This place was okay for food. I think I would come here again just for the waffle fries that are currently crossing my mind right now. Plus drinks, I rather hit up the pubs on main street instead since they have a better selection. 

Happy eating fellow Yelpers! =)"}
{"text":"I like this place.  It's clean and has a great patio that is set back from the street.

Servers are great.  Fast and super nice.  They always humour me when I feel like joking around.

A little weird though.  Sometimes I go there for pints and it is beyond dead on the inside, but sometimes rammed."}
{"text":"This place is only OK because it is convenient to my
place, otherwise I would avoid it.

They do show the UFC card for free and they always have tables available, so that is the main draw.

Service is ok, food is gross, pricing average. Nothing too thrilling or unique here. Sometimes overpopulated with tourist types or drunk students."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out this pub, i really like the atmosphere, it's not too rowdy and the live music entertainment every night gives the place a nice vibe. It helps support local artists which i find a plus and creates interaction for the audience/guests. The food was very good, although a tad pricey, but not as expensive as a place like the Keg or Cold Creek Canyon. Despite that, you DO get what you pay for! My friend and I tried the warm chips and dip, french onion soup and pie fries, all were very delicious and well worth the price. I dont drink, but my friend had their Ginger Mule and she said it was one of the best cocktails shes had, and she drinks a lot lolz. On another note some of the staff were kinda rude, i believe it was due to the late hour we were there (we arrived at 9:30 pm, left around 11:00pm) and that they were tired, however as a worker in the service industry myself i know that no matter how tired or grumpy you are (because lets face it we all have bad days) you always gotta keep a smile on your face! And make the customers welcome. Other than that, overall a great experience, awesome traditional celtic Scottish bar! :D"}
{"text":"Oh man oh man oh man. Love this place, love the vibe love the decor, definitely a spot you can go to get a drink, chill and catch up with friends. Went on a dinner date and had a $50 gift card and we decided to come here because it was close by.

We got our seats right away and it took awhile for them to come by and it was around 8pm on a Friday so it was getting busier. We decided to get the party platter with everything because we wanted to try everything on the menu. The platter came with chicken wings, these potato balls, chips and spinach and artichoke chips, it serves 6 but it was only for 2... couldn't finish it. Also had the fish tacos. Which I'm actually craving right now while I'm at a food court in Yorkdale while I write this review. 

Our waiter was legit he was very helpful and made sure we had everything we needed by the end of the night. Would I come back to this location. Yes, can't wait to try more of there food."}
{"text":"Usually love this pub, amazing fish and chips usually however this most recent visit was extremely disappointing. Waited 20+ minutes for the server to come take drink orders because it was \"busy\", there were about 5 tables with people. Order came out wrong and we were never asked how everything was to tell her. Will definitely try again as it's usually a favourite but tonight was a complete failure"}
{"text":"Who would've thought hotel pub food could be this good?  Their menu has a wide selection of pub fare.  I opted for a more standard dish, fish & chips.  The fish & chips quite good.  We had the stuffed mini Yorkies to start and they were great too.

Services was fast and friendly.  When we mentioned we were in a hurry to catch a movie the food came out in no time.

Great drink selection and specials.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Beer selection dreadful. Food, okish.

Had a terrible experience here where I made a reservation for 25 people two weeks in advance. When I showed up, the waitress claimed I was one minute late, and told me she'd given my table away. Ridiculous.

Don't go here if you don't have to."}
{"text":"Atrocious service: never checked in on us, full of attitude, and threw the bill at us! 

Located in a dodgy neighbourhood, east of Church and Bloor, this \"Irish\" pub is no lucky find.

Drinks were OK, nothing special. Clientele is after work crowd, mainly 30's and 40's.

Pub was half dead and TV was on loud. Perhaps the worst pub in a 10 mile radius. If you're thirsty, head over to Spirits Bar and Grill instead."}
{"text":"I walked in with some friends during their trivia night. Fortunately, we were able to find a table NOT in the trivia area, since with one of the group being in town only for the evening, we wanted to be able to chat. The fact that this table was inches from the kitchen was uninspiring, but that's the choice we had - noisy, or high-traffic.

The first thing on the menu that appealed to me was the Mac&Cheese. I'm Kosher, though, and don't eat bacon, so asked if it could come without. Nope - it's cooked in. I'm a tad surprised they don't have an option for no bacon, but there you have it. Waitress, very sweet and peppy and keeps calling all the women at our table \"honey\" and \"darling,\" recommends I get the vegetarian grillbread. I didn't feel like it, and ordered the veggie burger instead.

Five minutes later, she comes back and informs us that they're out of veggie burgers. At this point it's fish & chips or grillbread, or watch my friends eat dinner, so I go with the grillbread. It wasn't bad. Not spectacular, but eminently edible if you don't eat meat or shellfish and don't want to just be a spectator at the meal.

One of my friends got the Poutine, which she found tasted... off. Burnt, almost. We recognize it has a Guinness base, but she said it tasted unpleasant.

Don't remember what the third member of our party got, but it was also of the \"better than enh, but not stellar\" variety. 

Waitress was VERY nice and friendly, a tad pushy with her opinions about what I should order but in a way that probably goes REALLY well with straight male customers. Service was fairly speedy, prices reasonable, and two points for being presented with \"can we get separate bills\" *after* the meal and managing without blinking."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Fionn MacCools before, I had a great experience here.

 I ordered a Guinness Steak and mushroom crock. It contained large chunks of steak and the sauce was quite tasty. I savoured every bite. I also tried a beer called \"barking squirrel\" the waitress said it was tasty and she was right. It came in a tall glass with a little outline of a squirrel looking annoyed.  I thought this was hilarious. 

The decor was typical pub style with a few TV screens mounted on the walls here and there. 

It seems that they can accommodate any size group. The service was great and I would go back here if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend since the patio is open for the summer. I'll give this 4 stars given that it is one of the few pubs around with a decent patio. Thursday night they have live music outside which is OK - some might like it. 

Food was typical pub standard and service was decent, despite claims by others on the reviews that their service wasn't up to snuff. Not sure I'd venture to this pub in the winter though - inside was a bit boring to be honest."}
{"text":"Eat here often . Always consistent and fresh ! Best fish & chips ever . Tried the Rueben last week , wonderful and very filling . Worth every cent you spend here! Coming and eating here you feel at home ."}
{"text":"Heard great recommendations about this place so I decided to try it with my kids. I ordered hot wings, the kids had mac and cheese and pizza. 

Nothing was impressive. The wings were flavourless and were more sour than hot. The wings were $24 for two pounds and you have a choice of four flavours: Mild, medium, hot, and tandoori. 

If you can't do a simple thing like wings right, then sorry, I will be hesitant to try anything else."}
{"text":"Went out Friday night to Fionn's for some drinks and dinner, while the game was on, we waited 20 mins before we received our menus. She never took our drink order and and instead told us she would get our server, another 10 mins, still no server and no drinks. We left an went somewhere else that cares about their customers."}
{"text":"Very noisy, but that's to be expected in a pub. The service is quite good. We had the bacon burger and fish and chips special. The burger is filling!  Very well made and tasty. The salad that comes with it has a great dressing on it. Love the seeds for added flavor. Fish and chips were great as well. The one-piece fish was relatively large."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for a business dinner.  Great decor, good mix of tables, hightops, booths, and long bar tables.  Great wait staff and ours took care of our large group with a high degree of efficiency.  Good beer selection.  I will stop by the next time I am in the GTA."}
{"text":"Cute little Irish pub with a wide assortment of drinks! It's a great bar, their food is a little generic and there's not a huge selection, but I'd definitely come back here! Great vibe as well"}
{"text":"This pub is good! I've been here a few times for the pie (highly raved by one of my friends) and the safest choice after that would be hamburgers or fish and chips. I would always get French onion soup.. I find French onion tastes the best at pubs. We sat in the patio to enjoy nice warm weather where we were always checked up on by the waitress however, someone left their drink on a free table where a bunch of wasps kept coming near it since it was a sweet drink. It bothered us a bit, kinda gross cuz we were sitting right behind it so we asked to move. No problem, we got a both in the dining area. 

Food was yummy! They changed the fries. I remember years ago they used to be super chunky. They're a bit thinner now and tastes a lot better. 

Overall: good spacious chill place with friends. Will grab a drink next time if I wasn't in a rush to go somewhere after. 
Ps they accept scene card."}
{"text":"brutal service from wait staff.   two empty couple tables.  one with 2 chairs the other with 1.   \" unfortunately I can't move the chair\".   we didn't want to be right beside the entrance on the patio in direct sun! was 33 degrees.  refused to move a chair to a shaded vacant table!   bewildered, we asked again.  maybe she didn't \" get it\"? still sorry I can't?! my bf placed the chair in one motion walked ten feet and sat down.  I joined him and we were then blatantly ignored - server walks past and acts like we aren't there. we left.  good service pays.  bier market next door 100 x better- professional respectful experienced staff!"}
{"text":"Get the downtown Pub feel without travelling all the way downtown!  
The restaurant is located in borderline Woodbridge-Brampton area, but it really stands out, even from the outside.  Once we walked in it felt like the downtown location (darker \"Cheers\" type atmosphere) just not as busy.  We did go good there at a time when a band was playing (Thursday evening).  This is a great place to enjoy beers on tap.  There is also a nice patio with a big screen to enjoy the game outdoors.  
The staff is friendly however they don't come around too often when it is busy so you'll have to flag them down for your second pint.  
As for food, it's usual pub food, sometimes with an Irish twist, such as Guinness poutine and rover bites.  There is also a good selection of Sheppard's pie and Boxty.
It does get extremely busy during St.Paddy's day, which is no surprise, but you shouldn't have a problem getting a seat on other days.
I would recommend this bar over any that are around this area."}
{"text":"Big fan of this place. My girlfriend and I were staying at the Sheraton and it was nice having an Irish pub in the hotel. She had a roti chicken wrap and I had the Avocado bacon burger. Both very good. Also they had Harp on tap which is one of my favorite beers. Service was good."}
{"text":"Having dined at several other locations across Ontario, I can honestly tell you that Fionn Macool's is one of my favorite pubs. Having said that, the location which recently opened up in Newmarket does not live up the general reputation. Most of the staff we're not very welcoming, my friends and I were ignored by the hostess and had to seat ourselves, half of the items on the food and beverage menus weren't availabe due to \"late deliveries and broken kitchen equipment\", our server didn't  seem properly trained, each of our meals were missing at least one extra, and to make the experience worse the food really wasn't all that good. Yes, this is a brand new location and I understand that getting the routine down pat is a process. However, this location hardly does a good job of representing the Fionn Macool's franchise. Should I decide to visit again and my experience is noticeably different, I will adjust my review accordingly."}
{"text":"To those without 20/20 vision, don't make the same mistake as my friend by walking into the wrong washroom. The washroom names aren't a typo for male and female - mná means women and fir means men in Irish. 


Food was average, people were nice, and it wasn't too busy on a Friday evening. Also, they were showing the raptors game if you want to catch it!"}
{"text":"A mainstream Irish pub with a live vibe and awesome eats. Not quite a dive bar, a little more upscale with a sports bar on one side and a separate diner area on the other side.

The menu has lots of pub favourites, but one notable mention is their Irish pot pies. Great comfort food with healthy helpings of beef inside, savoury gravy and choice of potatoes, veggies or nacho for sides. The lamb, chicken and salmon pie options also impress.

For drinks, there's no shortage of the big Irish beer brands from Guinness to Kilkenny.  As an alternative, the radler from the cocktail menu is quite good with strong fruity notes mixed with a light weissbier."}
{"text":"Great pub style food and drinks. Good atmosphere. Excellent selection of local musicians who grace the stage every weekend. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Typical chain bar. Soulless and overpriced, but at least you know what you're getting. It's in a great location. For the Rogers Centre, so gets very crowded before Blue Jays games.
Food is edible and will fill a hole, but is nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"I love this pub, small and cosy, good beer selection and very good food. The patio is great, not my favorite though because of the proximity to the busy Bloor street, can be really noisy. Other than that, great for meet-ups with people from other cities and neighborhoods, easy to find and with plenty of parking along Ted Rogers Way and Church."}
{"text":"Last biz meeting of the day before a gruelling board meeting.  Needed to get a sanity check and a few fine ales to deaden the nerves before the night ahead.
FMac has places around town and also has several different banners they go by.  Each are similar but can have unique features.
This place is the newest one that I know of and is situated well.  At the corner of HWY27 and HW7, it is nestled between two new-ish hotels.  Though I've never seen it busy - when I've been there.  I'm pretty sure that the place is hopping once all the business people get back to their tiny rooms and need to forage for food and entertainment.
FMac's food is standard pub fare - their Irish Waffled Nachoes are a real standout - YUM!  Plenty of beers and shots to be had.
Service is always with a smile and a good time was had by all.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of big name or franchise restaurants however this pub is always consistent, great service and good food.  They have Bands on certain nights and really a comfy bar atmosphere.  I recommend the baked buffalo cauliflower as well as the cod sandwich.  Their house salad is amazing as their dressing is so good.  All staff there, bar and wait staff are super friendly.  Plus you can get scene points as well as money off your bill if you show your CAA membership card."}
{"text":"I had a great few times here. Good atmosphere and service. The hostess, Robin, was very helpful with seating us outside on the patio. As soon as we got there it was only a few minutes before our waitress came and got our drink orders. She was so nice and very knowledgeable about the various beer selections. I forget her name though :( I had the seafood pie with a side garden salad that had a sort of dijon mustard dressing. It was super tasty. My friend got the avocado and bacon burger. I had a bite and this was really good too!

I've been here twice now and will continue to come here."}
{"text":"Met with my girlfriend at fionns on Friday. They moved beside Boston pizza and they have patio now too.
The place is way spacious than before it's been a while since I last been. 
I am very disappointed with the portion the price and the menu.. 
Though I had their beef and mushroom boxtie it was same portion size. The soup was awesome...but child size. The calamari was ruberry... Very...
Iced tea was watered down. Price was kinda steep for the portion size received.
I don't think I would recommend this place again specially being an Irish pub....there are other places with better bang for your buck... But that's just me...hence...its down grade to 2 stars..."}
{"text":"It was loud. I would love to say more but I can't hear my own thoughts over the loudness that still echoes in my head.

Not to be a party pooper but I came for a girls night of chit chat and drinks and good food. So this was way too loud for that.

Looking for fun and drinks and don't care so much about catching up with your bestie? Then this would be good. 

Bathroom was a fail. Not clean, no soap. Not fun.

Staff was almost friendly. 

Fish tacos - yum! I will give them a rave review. Perfectly prepared and so delicious.

Dessert was also pretty great.

Hmmm, maybe my experience wasn't as bad as I am remembering. I'm writing this after the fact and when I think back, my thoughts are fairly negative. But I think that was more about the experience and ambience. The food was clearly good.

My bad for not realizing this isn't a place for girl talk?"}
{"text":"When I went in the bartender, Arthur, introduced him self to me and addressed me by my name all night . He was very attentive towards me and provided excellent service. The wings were good. Overall good experience. Will go there again."}
{"text":"Grrreat Lunch spot on Bloor street!
You must sit on the patio.....weather permitting!
Lots of suits come here for drinks after work.

Had Lunch here with my sister. Our server was super nice and cheery. Actually all the staff here were very friendly.

The menu is simple but lots of goodies to choose from.
We were taking forever to order because we couldn't decide but our server was really patient and gave us tons of time, no rush, and checked on us and even gave us suggestions.

For starters we had the potato and bacon grill bread. Smoky bacon, sliced potatos, melted cheese and sour cream. It was soOoOo delicious and a generous portion but we some how devoured the whole thing splitting the last slice. The suits beside us even commented on how delicious it smelled and looked. Our server recommened this and said next time we should try the smoked chicken one too.

For mains I had the steak sandwich grilled perfectly medium rare on top of a garlic cheese baguette with fried onions and mushrooms. Your average steak sandwich nothing out of the norm but still tasty. For side I chose the emerald green salad with strongbow cider-citrus vingarette. Loved the dressing, you can taste the strongbow beer in the dressing but it was not overpowering just delicious.

My sister had the lobster sliders which were part of their summer menu. She said they were also really good and also enjoyed the salad.

Overall great meal, service, and location.
I will definately be back for to try the other grill breads!"}
{"text":"Came in Saturday night on St.Patty's day weekend. The place had an energetic vibe from the time we entered. The pub is split into two sections the dining room and bar side. Definitely sit on the bar side as that's where all the action is.

We were lucky enough to snag the last available table in a cozy corner against a comfy leather banquet infront of a high table with the Leafs game playing on all the flat screen tvs.

Our cheery waitress comes over to greet us and gives us time to go over the menus. She comes back to take our drink orders. Fionn is one of the few pubs that carry the only beer I drink so I felt the need to indulge.

Fruli - Strawberry flavoured beer is served up cold in the bottle and is fruity & refreshing 

For Appetizer we decide to go with something a little different

Buffalo Chicken Meatball Skewers - Chicken meatballs tossed in our medium wing sauce, blue cheese drizzle. Served with celery sticks, medium wing sauce for dipping
Three plump tender meatballs with a distinct chicken flavour not quite as juicy as a beef meatball but I loved the wing sauce. Just the right amount of heat and tang I couldn't help but dip every morsel in it. 

For main I decided to keep it Irish

Corned Beef & Cabbage
Lester's legendary corned beef, Montréal's favourite since 1931, cabbage, mustard,
buttermilk mashed potatoes
Huge portion, Tender corned beef, on a mountain chunky homemade buttermilk mashed potatoes. Great flavour, a true to stick to your ribs hearty meal!

As soon as I saw the dessert menu I knew what I had to have!

Red Velvet Donuts - Icing sugar, white chocolate sauce.
This is a MUST have! These warm & plump sweet little donuts were simply heavenly! I'd take them over tiny tom donuts any day! 
*Don't forget to add some french vanilla ice cream for the ultimate hot & cold luscious finish to a fab meal

Overall excellent service, wonderful food, Live band with great music after 10pm, and a fun atmosphere with a good crowd, Fionn definitely is a welcome gem in the Ajax area!"}
