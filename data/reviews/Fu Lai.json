{"text":"I stumbled upon fu lai walking down bloor street in the mood for chinese. I noticed that the sign outside of the window was yellow sign, not a full pass. I didnt take much note and proceeded with caution into the restaurant. I ordered my mediocre dish and headed downstairs to the washroom that looked like a scene from a horror movie. I didnt even feel comfortable going to the bathroom because there wasnt a light inside the room so i headed back up and finished my meal and left. 

Bottom line
Food was nothing spectacular 
Cleanliness was missing"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place. I was here on a business trip and wanted something quick and easy and saw the reviews saying they were very quick. I was on the phone with the receptionist for over 15 minutes just trying to explain where our hotel was and ordering the food. The restaurant called me back to say the delivery guy was here and told us to go downstairs, however, he was not there. They called me back saying he was now at our door. He ended up being at the wrong hotel. He finally comes in to the right hotel and the delivery guy didn't have enough change to give us back the proper amount. Once that was settled, we began eating our food, and I found disgusting chewy parts in my general tao chicken, uncooked broccoli, and the deep fried pork wontons were nasty and tasteless. Not only did we wait over an hour for our food, got over charged for delivery fees, and our food was gross! Definitely not ordering from here again and I wouldn't recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Food is alright. Their salt and pepper chicken wing is pretty good. However, the service is good only when you can pick up. Not the nicest place to dine in. And they do have problem delivering. We ordered delivery and they negotiated about the price of delivery at which stage we just ordered pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered Cantonese chow mein, garlic broccoli, and spicy peanut chicken.  Apparence wise the food looked good, but it failed to impress. Chow mein is usually my favourite Chinese food dish, however, this one sucked. Huge chunks of gelatin were in the noodles which left me so grossed out I wouldn't eat the rest. The garlic broccoli was average, probably the one I ate the most of. Finally the only thing that tasted like peanuts in the spicy peanut chicken dish was the peanuts sitting on top. Wasn't bad, but the peanut sauce on top tasted absolutely nothing like the traditional peanut sauce I think of when ordering a dish like that.
Overall, I probably wouldn't order from here again.. I'll stick with New Ho King."}
{"text":"Basic Chinese food. Good prices.
Only once when we ordered they're was a hair in my meal. I know it's hard to avoid but still I was grossed out."}
{"text":"Received a menu in the mail. Advertised as \"New York\" style Chinese Food so we thought we'd give it a try.  Food was atypical Canadian style Chinese Food. Pass on the Chicken Balls as were very doughy with little Chicken. General Tso's Chicken and Shanghai noodles were decent. One comment is that they say delivery in 30-40 min and it was literally at our door in less than 10 minutes (almost too fast... it should take more than a few minutes to cook the food). As an alternative Check out China China Palace."}
{"text":"Just had them deliver to my place today and it was delicious.  Always get what you expect.  The prices are decent and the portions are pretty good as well.  I'm so full right now that I can't look at it again for another few weeks."}
{"text":"Typical food court chinese food offering in a $7 buffet

2 soups, 2 noodles and 10 other dishes with chicken, beef, tofu and veggies

Fried rice, chicken balls and egg rolls as a bonus

Friendly service and food quality is good and at $7 offers a lot if value to the double platers out there"}
{"text":"Good food but the delivery driver complained when I tipped him 5$, as if it wasn't enough. Rude. Won't be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"I discovered Fu Lai through Just-Eat.ca as one of the few places that deliver to my area for orders of just $15. I ordered the Black Bean Beef Flat Noodles and some Spicy Chicken Wings. However, I don't know how either of those taste because what I got instead was the Malaysia Fried Noodles and the Beef Lo Mein. By the time I figured out what had happened (my order got mixed up with another person's), the delivery man was long gone. It had been a long day and I was way too hungry to call and wait for them to fix my order. From what I had though, the Malaysia Fried noodles were very fufilling, which is why Fu Lai isn't crossed out of my list just yet. Hopefully they get my order right next time!"}
{"text":"First time trying fui lai. It very delicious and tasty ! Definitely will be ordering from them again and will be recommending to my friends and family. This place is definitely great take out. I ordered chicken lo mein, spring rolls, lemon chicken, Cantonese chow mein and yung chow fried rice. Definitely fresh and hot. Delivery was pretty quick."}
{"text":"Solid Chinese place - don't often get adventurous but the general tso is great for the $$"}
{"text":"For local delivery American style Chinese food, it's pretty good.  Always do delivery, have never eaten there.   Ordered from Wok Terminal a few times but I find this place is better.   The sweet and sour chicken balls are good (for what it is) as well as the fried rice.  Ordered the general tsao chicken, crispy beef (not that crispy), sesame chicken, Cantonese chow mein, etc regularly and it's always consistent.  

Rating it 4 stars as it well represents basic take out Chinese."}
{"text":"It's the usual Westernized Chinese, but pretty much hits the spot. I like them better than Mandarin or even Chinese Food Gallery. We've ordered here a lot thru JustEat, and I'm pleasantly surprised at how fast they are able to deliver my food every time. The dishes are always hot, fresh and tasty-- but as expected also very greasy and make a bit of a mess (and smell) afterwards. Yesterday after a trip to LCBO, we were driving around looking for somewhere to get take away dinner, and we decided on some greasy Chinese to go with our stash of beer. We decided to make a trip to Fu Lai as I was curious how the place looks like. Turns out it's really near our place but we just never noticed it before. The place is decent and looks clean, but not ideal for dining in. It was empty on a Friday night, but judging from how the phone was constantly ringing, they were receiving continuous orders. Staff were friendly, attentive, and quick! My order was ready in about 10 minutes, neatly packed in a big brown paper bag. We usually get the Cantonese chow mein, Yang chow fried rice and Salt & pepper squid. Last night we also tried the Honey garlic wings which was very oily but flavourful and went well with ice cold beer. They have generous portions and we actually had enough left-overs for lunch today. I like the fortune cookies that they give for free, and the Wing's chili sauce really complements the dishes more than Sriracha or any other hot sauce."}
