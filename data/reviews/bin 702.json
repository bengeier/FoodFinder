{"text":"Awesome staff, awesome drinks and amazing selections!!! Came out here for the first time and selected the bloody beer and was blown away! Nicky took the time to explain the menu and everyone was absolutely satisfied with their drinks! Definitely a must when visiting the amazing Container Park!"}
{"text":"$9 beer in a plastic cup and mediocre unfriendly service?!?!?!  Oh? You have glass?  You're right, you should HAVE thought to ask me before you poured... I probably would have stayed for a small plate!

This place is not exactly what I thought it would be when I stumbled across the place while exploring Fremont street...  I expected more based only on the appearance."}
{"text":"Fabulous friendly service, delicious grilled sandwich bites, cute interior, excellent beer and sangria selection.  Very cozy place to enjoy a beer and a light bite."}
{"text":"Had to come here for the hot Cheeto grilled cheese sandwich, and it was just as good as I had imagined it would be! Definitely, a must have! 

This is a great little spot in downtown LV, and they have a great beer and wine selection. The inside is somewhat small but their patio area is fairly sized and has comfortable seating. They also have fun games for you to play while you eat and drink."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Came for a quick bachelorette brunch before bar hopping, and we had an amazing time! Naomi and Terri the bartenders were so cool and made our brunch very memorable! There's a ton of board games and even Simon! Hit up this place if you're looking for a great experience!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this place is hands down one of our favorite places in Vegas. It's located in Container Park and is a hidden gem. The staff is passionate about what they do, and made our experience one that we will always remember. Big thanks to Ryan and Sarah for sharing your joy and love for wine and the bin meat & cheese platter. You guys to rock! I can't wait to come back again. What a great way to finish up my Easter weekend!"}
{"text":"Great staff - they make you feel welcome the moment you walk in! And epic cocktail menu.... fresh, surprising  recipes that are delicious! I could sit here all day, playing trivia with the cards they have at the tables, sipping drinks and listening to their jazzy music."}
{"text":"Stop in for a drink and ended up eating and drinking for hours. The duck sandwich was to die for.  We also had the lobster sandwich it was heaven. We had two specialty drinks a THE DEVIL INSIDE and the 1& ONLY IRISH MULE both rocked. Service was great be back soon."}
{"text":"Cute little place in the Container park...BUT  Walked in because I saw it said wine bar on the window.   I had a pinot noir @ 12 and my friend had a white wine for $9.     Our wine came in two glass cups not wine glasses.   The wine tasted really bad almost like box wine....I expected better just because of the price and the fact that it had said wine bar....I will not come back and waste my money!   So many great bars are popping up nowdays such as downtown cocktail room & Bin 702 is not one of them!"}
{"text":"Perfect place in Las Vegas to check out and not be on the strip!  its small and cozy with a great patio.  They also have several fun games to play that bring back some childhood memories.  One of the owners was there and bought us a round of cheese.  Thanks Sonny for always serving us.  Your cheese is great!"}
{"text":"Awesome spot for wine and cheese. Hip interior that's fun and upscale without being too stuffy. My first time there, I got one of the boards (the charcuterie and cheese combination board) with wine. My second time, I got a coffee cocktail and their brie-with-honey-and-almond sandwich, and that's when I fell in love with the place. Their sandwiches are amazing, and I like their cocktails even more than the wine (which is also great). I'll definitely be coming back a lot."}
{"text":"Crafty cocktails. Great beer selection. Intimate vibe. Nice staff. 

We had two of their specialty cocktails on a Friday night during summer.  Very refreshing.  However, was very disappointed in the size to price ratio.  Pretty expensive for a drink that did not even fill up what I think was a 10oz cup.  Any who, life goes on.

The place itself is very well put together.  All the decor, the colors, the furniture, etc.  someone did a great job in designing the place. 

Grab a drink, a table right out front, and enjoy the live music!

Will be going back again."}
{"text":"Three stars only for Bin 702 and here's why:
Very yummy Turkey Brie panini. The crunch on the bread and the apricot jam just make this a melty goodness and I would order it again. The negative - two house wines ordered and unavailable, with no offer of substitution. So I opted for ice water instead which came from the tap of the hand sink. Gross and a big no no. This is a cute place in Container Park and the girls working there seem to have it together. Not sure who the guy is, that came out checking on things and handing out handsink tap. I'm going to try the Lobster roll next time, but I'll check first to see if they have stocked their house wine."}
{"text":"Sarah, Taryn, and Bri rocked it! Now I wish I would have taken a photo. My husband and I love having cheese and meat plates and this was by far the best one that we have ever had! We had the \"bin\"and went with Sarah's awesome recommendations. The plate comes complete with candied walnuts, sunflower seeds, honeycomb, gourmet mustard, and a baguette. Being celiac, I could not have the baguette but it didn't matter. I made little cheese, meats, and spread \"sandwiches\" with the very generous portions provided!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic night here. The service was on point, the drink menu is solid, and the food was delicious.

My boyfriend and I arrived at about 6:00. This was my first time at the Container Park, so I was a bit nervous about how \"Disney-ified\" it looked. But, the sun was still up, kids were everywhere; I decided to be patient. We went straight to Bin 702 and found a table inside immediately, despite the limited seating. There were three employees working that night and each served us in turn. They were welcoming and willing to chat with us. It was a bit loud because there was music playing outside and inside is such close quarters that you can hear other tables and people at the bar clearly. 

We had 2 rounds of unibrou maudite to drink and to eat we had the deviled eggs and the \"bin\" (which is a combo. cheese board and charcuterie) to start, and then we split the Italian panini. I recommend you try everything I just listed. Not a weak item in the bunch. We especially relished the bin board, which also includes olives, nuts, and honey and jam. The Italian panini was like the Platonic ideal of a panini: melty cheese and salty meat between crispy, warm bread. We spent about $80, not including tip, which seems reasonable to me. 

By the time we finished, the sun was down and the kids had gone. We sat outside of the restaurant and enjoyed people-watching for a while. It was an all-around lovely evening and I hope to enjoy another night at Bin 702 again soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the Devil's Smash cocktail. It's a cross between a light margarita taste and mojito. Very light and refreshing. The bartender Rachel was very friendly. We ordered the cheddar grilled cheese. It has a hot Cheetos spread with mozzarella. If you need a snack grab one to share it was yummy and different."}
{"text":"Tried the lobster salad sandwich and a couple of grilled cheeses for the kids. We ate our lunches quickly as my girls wanted to get back to playing on the playground. The lobster sandwich was pretty big and it came with a side of Greek salad, but I managed to finish it all. All was good, although I personally would have liked my sandwich to have more sriracha. I'll be back soon to try the wines, and I saw someone enjoying a little cheese plate - that looked good too."}
{"text":"I loved everything about my experience. From the unique decor and warm atmosphere, to the bartender who was an actual real person and was so fun to chat with, to the beer selection, all the way down to the Turkey Brie panini...it was all so great."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! The owner Don came and hung out with us. He was so nice and accommodating. The bartender, Rachel, took such really good care of us. Try the grilled cheese :) great spot!"}
{"text":"Turkey and Brie sandwich was phenomenal. Staff was friendly, prompt, and helpful. Atmosphere was clean and relaxed. I definitely recommend stopping by for a quick bite or a glass of wine!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the happy menu.  Please revisit your wine happy hour offerings. You offer 2 wines for happy hour that are only $1.00 less than the regular price!  1/2 off or 2 for 1 is a typical happy hour...not $1.00 off the regular price....you've been warned."}
{"text":"We happened upon this amazing place, and loved it! Right when we walked in, Naomi greeted us-she was so friendly and welcoming. Then, Ronnie made us DELICIOUS sandwiches. Love the vibe, the drinks, and the service!!"}
{"text":"Love the Cuban sandwich! Delicious. Nice cozy place to have a drink in the front patio and enjoy the view of container park."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!!!! Our bartender was so nice :) the beer was great and the atmosphere was great can't wait to go back and try the cheer she meat platter it looked so good this is on our list of favorites"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a beer and a lobster grilled cheese and all I can say is WOW!  Friendly service and the best grilled cheese I've ever had in my life.  I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Natalie rocks! typo the name was Naomi and she still ROCKS! I again had the grilled Lobster sandwich which was great. All food was very flavorful. I will be back shortly again!  BTW Boris takes food to another level!"}
{"text":"Husband and I went here last Thursday 1/04/18 to grab a quick drink. Even though the place is super tiny inside I kind of liked it, it felt quaint. I had Taryn's B*!chface, I wasn't sure about the early grey tea but it was actually quite delish. My husband had the Ginny McCarthy and he said it was refreshing."}
{"text":"Atmosphere, personable staff, excellent customer service, superb cocktails, and delicious food! Great place for locals, business persons, or just a tourist looking for great vibes! Bin 702's location in Container Park downtown Las Vegas, Freemont East, is perfect. I am local, and I just found my new favorite place downtown! It's a wine bar with amazing food options to pair with it! So far, my favorite thing to order on the menu for a beverage, is the last option, be adventurous and let the bartender decide for you! I had a few different creations over a couple of days, and 2 came in first place at a tie, \"Jubilee Street\" and \"everything isn't icky\" by Davey. The guys and gals, such as Davey and Desiree,  have flare and style with such unique qualities that come together and you taste the love in the food and drinks! Each hand crafted beverage was different and had my taste buds craving more! Thank you team Bin 702 for making such great memories. Cheers to many more! (my runner up for 2nd place cocktail was the Downtowner and this drink they make with Ginger Beer made by Desiree!) You effin Rock!!!!"}
{"text":"Cute place in the Container Park. Super-friendly staff, good food and drinks. Pleasantly surprised by this find!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because the food was okay and the beer was cold. We were very excited to try the happy hour menu after we read the sign outside the patio area. We arrived around 3:00pm, placed our drink order, and asked about one of the food items listed on the \"Happy Hour\" menu posted outside. We were rudely told by a blonde bartender \"No food on the Happy Hour menu, all full priced-what would you like?\" We accepted the response and ordered two of the full price \"hot cheeto paninis.\" After our order was placed around 3:15pm, we sat on the patio and enjoyed our drinks. There were only 3 other parties being served on the patio, the inside of the establishment was empty. The large party that arrived after us received an incredible amount of food before us around 3:30pm. My boyfriend approached the bar counter to ask about the status of our food, but before he was able to ask, the blonde bartender asked him how we enjoyed our sandwiches. He explained that we hadn't received our food yet, but that we were fine with waiting a few more minutes. She offered no apology or explanation. 4:00pm rolls around, still waiting for our food, and I approached the bar counter to ask about the status of our sandwiches. The bartender responded \"Sh*t, hold on we'll get them out to you.\" as someone who looked like the cook yelled from behind the bartender, \"I'm throwing them on the grill now!\" We received two very simple sandwiches around 4:20p with no apologies or compensation for making us wait over an hour for our food. As we ate, one of the employees stood on the patio conversing with one of the other parties, cursing about every 5 words, yelling, \"Fu*k Trump! Put me on a tv show, I'll tell the whole world! She continued to scream her political views, high fiving the party around her, then ended the speech with, \"Sh*t, I'm on the clock, I should probably get back to work. Fu*ck Trump!\" and walked back inside. The family with two small children sitting near the patio got up and walked away, while a man who was clearly on a phone call, had to get up and relocate due to how loudly she had been screaming. Overall, it was not an enjoyable experience. This bummed us out because we typically love our afternoons downtown/in the container park. Will not be returning, and as locals, we will not be recommending Bin702 to any of our friends or visitors we have."}
{"text":"So, so close to five stars.

I came here with the intention of the trying the very delicious looking flamin' hot grilled cheese. 

The staff is friendly, and the container is cute. It's obviously not very big, so I am glad it wasn't busy. 

The grilled cheese has great flavor. I loved the bread; it was so thick and fluffy. The cheetos added just the right amount of kick. I was surprised to see the cheeto dust added after grilling. Usually, it's added before, so it doesn't fall off. This version makes it a little harder to eat, but the flavor is stronger. 

I had to take one star off because the cheese wasn't melted all the way. It's just not quite grilled cheese with only semi-melted cheese. They should consider how to better make sure the cheese is fully melted with such a thick bread. Don't get rid of the bread -- just melt the cheese more! 

Overall, I would definitely eat it again."}
{"text":"East coast vibes in container park. When the waitress found out our party was all locals she sat down with us and really went over the menu and pointed out some good drink and food pairings. I had the salad, a couple mini sandwiches, and the olives. 11/10 would go again."}
{"text":"This place has a stellar charcuterie plate. The beer and wine selection are pretty great and I love the cozy feel of the tiny little container."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here well over a year ago for the first time and sat and drank wine for hours and had the best experience. The staff was so great, the atmosphere was perfect - not too loud or crazy - it had a great wine bar chill vibe. Last night we went by again to have a glass of wine after dinner. We didn't have the same service as we had last time, it has changed to be more of a cocktail and beer place, the wine list seemed to be smaller, and the vibe has just changed. We were served our wine in small clear plastic glasses and my boyfriend was given the wrong wine - he ordered a red and the bartender gave him a white wine. He let her know she had given him the wrong wine, and she tried to correct it, but was out of the original wine he had ordered. We were disappointed by what this place has transformed into, but wouldn't completely avoid it in the future. It has just transformed into something different than what we were looking to have again last night."}
{"text":"great food and great customer service. love this place. get the sandwiches they are next level"}
{"text":"Came here with my husband while walking through container park. I ordered the hot Jameson cider and he ordered the tiny Pom. We sat in the booths indoor and had our drinks delivered sans napkins. The spiced cider was ok : it had a nice kick was a bit sweet but it covered the bourbon taste . His tiny Pom , was not as good as we had imagined . It didn't taste like vodka , pomegranate juice , or rosemary .. It actually tasted like straight vermouth. He questioned the bartender if they had made the right drink , she assured him it was the tiny Pom but offered to make another - he ordered the hot Jameson cider - as he knew that would be ok . 
Overall an ok experience, good place in container park. It's such a nice cute hip spot just wish their cocktail menu was better ."}
{"text":"This was the first spot here I found that was so Vegas. Taryn was awesome! I felt like I was in a down to earth environment instead of the usual strip. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This spot is really phenomenal !  From the unique blend of food offerings and of course great beer and wine choices you will not be disappointed.  Their food is really quality; they choose stellar ingredients and add wonderful sauces and delectable combinations which will make you want more and leave you more than happy you decided to try this bistro out.  Prices are a tad high but it's more than worth the gourmet experience you get in return.  Staff are quite lovely and helpful as well."}
{"text":"I was at Simply Pure that dosnt serve alcohol, SO I went to bin 702 for a drink, I asked what was a good drink and she suggested some kinda Bloody Mary beer thing for 8 bucks 
1st she fills a plastic 16oz cup with Ice
2nd she adds some tomato juice stuff
3rd she opens a beer I think Bud light and pours in no more then 6oz of beer
4th she hands it to me
5th i say, you want me to pay 8 bucks for that?
7th I let her keep it and went to the place next door and got 2 PBRs for 2.95 each
Now Im happy again."}
{"text":"Delicious! Great selection of booze. Amazing what they can do with such limited space. Think about it. This is a shipping container and a majority of their supplies, food, drinks, dishes are all located within the container.  I'm impressed. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Affordable snacks & awesome beer!! They craft beers & wines on tap. They have delightful mini sandwiches for 2.50 each. Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"I only had a (much needed) cocktail but I'm giving 5 stars for the customer service alone. I was in a pretty bad mood & the cheerful bartender (I think her name was Chelsea?) was very warm & friendly. Between her attitude & the vodka in my drink I left in a slightly better mood."}
{"text":"Decent place to drink. The mixologist mixed up a fireball like shot for my friend who loves fireball. It was damn tasty and better than the real fireball."}
{"text":"Came here for my break and was greeted by the most friendliest staff. Sara and Kat are so impressionable and will share their knowledge of their wines and spirits. 
They also have food! Don't get me started on the cheese platters OMG! I go every Saturday for mine. It's filled with a variety of regional cheeses, fig jam(my fav), real honey comb, candied walnuts, dried cherries and a huge French baguette. It all goes so well with my wine which I drink religiously on Sundays with.... You guessed it my cheese platter. Love you guys! Keep up the awesomeness!"}
{"text":"Loved this place which is made out out 2 shipping containers all done up inside. The lady bartenders where great and a pleasure to be around . Good vibes, punk music at the time, swanky chill vibe with some good drinks and what looked to be some good eats. 
Next time I'll go for the flaming hot Cheeto grilled cheese sandwich when I'm there. 
Stop by have a drink/bite and give them some love."}
{"text":"We stopped in when the adults and kiddos were all looking for something to eat after a long day of playing on the gigantic play structure nearby and a long day of watching the kids play on said structure!

The advertised happy hour was solid, something like $4 for a beer or wine and a few food specials. We decided to grab one of their luxurious grilled cheese options. They ranged from a $6 standard to a $15 lobster grilled cheese. We sampled the original and an apple/bree - holy cheese this was good! Really nice melding of flavors on a some boss bread! The original with white cheddar was quite lovely as well - served on some thick toast, it was delicious!

All in all, this was just about the perfect restaurant for adults watching the kiddos run off energy. The gals inside were very nice and kept things moving nicely. End of the day - Beer, wine, sangria, grilled cheese, done!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, great Bloody Mary and killer mini sandwiches the staff is nice and the patio seating is super cool. I like the place whenever I'm downtown."}
{"text":"My wife and I had some family in town and we decided to check out container patk in downtown Las Vegas. We came across \"bin 702\" in container park and decided to check them out. The wife and I went with the lobster grilled cheese while the wife's sister went with the flammin hot cheeto's grilled cheese. The ingredients were very fresh and the bread was flaky and had the perfect amount of herbs placed. The ingredients were top notch from what I could tell. The reason I'm giving them a 3 stars is that none of our sandwhiches had melted cheese. Its like they put everything together and then press it on a panini hot press to give it grill marks. When you think of a grilled cheese sandwhich you want melted cheese right? 45$ for 3 sandwhiches and 3 cans of sprite was also a little too much for what you get."}
{"text":"The hot cheeto turkey sandwich was AMAZING ! The service not so much. We decided to give this place another try after the first time we came we were told to have a seat wherever and sat right next to the bar on the tables. And never was served. People walked in and would get there alcoholic beverages ordered after waiting 15-20 min we decided to just walk out after over hearing them take someones food order right after walking in. We did not even get to order a drink. We really wanted to try the sandwich so we returned a couple months later to give it a try, as i said amazing!!! Service was just not attentive. Would definitely return back to order to go and sit elsewhere outside the establishment"}
{"text":"Here's what was on our menu: 

1. Lobster Grilled Cheese
2. Brie, Apple, and Honey Grilled Cheese
3. FLAMING HOT TURKEY GRILLED CHEESE 
4. Cuban Montadito (bite size sandwich)

Verdict: 

1. Lobster Grilled Cheese was sooooooo goood! I was a bit skeptical at first because I thought it would taste more mayo-y and not lobster-y but NOPE, you could actually taste the lobster. The bread is so crispy but also soft. Highly recommend. 
2. Brie, Apple, and Honey Grilled Cheese. This was good but after the Lobster Grilled Cheese it was a little bland. Maybe it needed more honey? I would get this but I would definitely eat this first. 
3. Flaming Hot Grilled Cheese. Maybe my expectation was too high bc I loveeeee Flaming Hot Cheetos. I mean don't get me wrong, I still ate it and licked my fingers but I kind of wish there were Flaming Hot Cheetos served on the side! That would've been perfection. 
4. Cuban Montadito. Don't waste your time on the small sandwiches. Just get a big one. I bet the regular Cuban would've been delicious."}
{"text":"I have been here countless times and I am mad at myself for not writing a review until now!

Admittedly, I don't come to downtown very often...I'm more of an LV Strip or Summerlin kind of girl ;) but I will gladly head to downtown for bin's charcuterie platter. I believe they call it the bin 702. It's a wooden paddle filled with meats, cheeses, bread, olives, mustard and honeycomb! Not honey...honeycomb! It's unbelievable tasty.

They have wines on tap which my friends love. My favorite pairing is a glass of champagne and that amazing charcuterie board. I seriously can't get enough of it.

Sit outside on the patio and enjoy! Headed back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm born and raised in Las Vegas and I never come downtown for lunch and this place will bring me here more often. It was exactly what we were looking for, reasonable drink prices and great food. Naomi and Terry were awesome and we will for sure be back. 

The Brie grilled cheese was phenomenal"}
{"text":"Fanatic place to have a drink and get a grill cheese sandwich!  Place is unbelievable and perfect place to hang out for a couple of drinks.  It in Container Park #DowntownLasVegas"}
{"text":"I just popped in here because I didn't wanna be in my house on a beautiful 95 degree day... I'm not very knowledgeable on beers and Kelly asked me what I liked and immediately poured me a big dog brew (a local vegas brewery ive been meaning to try) and it was perfect taste. 
The inside is very relaxed and comfy for setting up my little corner here on the couch. 
Will definately be back for the 3 to 6 happy hour and many many more brews. Thanks Kelly"}
{"text":"What is it with downtown restaurants and shitty service? Came for takeout, two staff behind the counter took 5 minutes to acknowledge me. Male looked at me waiting and decided to start sweeping instead. Inquired if I could place an order and was asked if it could wait til he was done. Apparently sweeping takes priority over paying customers.

Turkey and brie sandwich was served with a tiny side salad with balsamic, more of a garnish than a side, for $10. Good quality bread, ample amount of turkey, great accents of apricot jam and a house-made aioli...But no brie. WTF?!"}
{"text":"This place is just okay. Could be run a whole lot better than it is. My husband & I went in prior to Happy Hour to beat the crowds & it was still very crowded and you feel like a sardine in there because it is a bit warm with very little seating. So to the left is this wall of couches and there were two young women there reserving 2/3 of the couch for their friends who weren't even there yet! Had their feet up on the couch!! Since when is THAT okay??? When I mentioned it to the bartender she did zilch about it so I told the girls when her friends arrive we will get up!! Friends never arrived the entire time we were there.Hardly any seating in the place so they need to have some rules about that. Biggest problem was the bartender, a tall tattooed blonde woman who kept repeating like we were brain dead that hey, I am the only person here taking orders! We never complained & we just stood there. But the clincher and the reason we will NEVER go back & we go to Vegas quite often is this bartender! When the bar thinned out we got up & sat at the bar. My husband & I were conversing about something that happened back home & I said something to him which & get this the bartender eaves-dropped & gave me this look & attitude that was beyond belief!! Firstly, I wasn't even talking about anyone in there and what a rude thing to do to not only listen to a private convo but then huff about it, roll your eyes & act as if I was talking about HER! It was pretty ridiculous. When I saw her do this I said right away to her that we weren't talking about anyone there, YET she proceeded to show the disgusted face & acted all annoyed!! Lol! Huh?? Really Bin702!! Save this crap for your therapist. I was there to relax & should be able to talk about what I want to quietly with my hubby without getting judgement OR someone listening in, let alone making faces & judging!!! It was so weird. Prices are high for the grilled cheese which is just okay. Seriously, Over $34.00 for two grilled cheese ( and NOT the lobster) and three beers.The girl making the grilled cheese was very nice but JEEZ....I mean really? They cater to the locals & the bartender was VERY obvious in who she preferred and who she gave priority to. Trust me when I say it wasn't US. I am a VERY generous tipper even when service is lacking some. This reaction by her & lack of organization overall in how things are being done is something I don't want to revisit. Sorry, but I was so excited about coming here and what a let down. If they would be more organized and nicer it could improve.Maybe she was having a bad day who knows but did I feel welcome....NO, was the food phenomenal...NO was this place comfortable....NO. We have our faves downtown but unfortunately this one will not be on the list. For the girl making the sandwiches...thank you for being so nice. You are the ONLY reason we left a tip. I hope you got some of it!"}
{"text":"Wow! Great things come from small bins. What a surprise to walk into a shipping container and find an awesome place to eat. Now the seating is very casual but there is a lot inside or the seating areas outside. The sandwiches were combinations of flavors that resulted in very tasty bites. Glad the sandwiches were 4\" so that I could get a serving board of six. I was filled and enjoying the flavors. The turkey was my favorite, second the Brie and third the Cuban. The rolls were grilled so well they added so much flavor.
The service was a pleasant surprise, very good attention, description and everything you could ask for. After being to so many other places to try something new it is great to find a real winner. If you are ever on Fremont street try Bin 702, you'll like it"}
{"text":"Excellent! Atmosphere is great, food is wonderful, and drinks are even better! The staff was very efficient and attentive! A bit costly, but worth it! I will be back, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I had to reinstall Yelp just to review this place.  Simple health conscious delicious food and craft beer really made our Vegas trip pre-clubbing dinner complete.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"Great place for a beer or glass of wine while the kids run around in container park.  The Montaditos (mini sammys) are great!  Sit back, relax, and have a drink!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Service was excellent.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich plates.  One for me and one for the kids.  The kids loved their sandwich and great presentation as \"sandwich fingers.\"  My sandwich was also good and came with an amazing salad.  I'm not one to eat cherry tomatoes but they complimented the salad.  I asked and they said that they can even substitute it as a full size salad since it is not on the salad menu.  I took a star off because they no longer had their everything bagel deviled eggs but still love this place."}
{"text":"I love stopping by Bin 702! Can't go wrong with their wine selection & snacks. They have some type of amazing grilled cheese that I dream about at night sometimes! :) 

When the weather is nice I grab a seat on the patio to watch Container Park in action! The staff is also friendly & attentive. Def my downtown LV go-to!"}
{"text":"Similar to other reviews on here....I cannot seem to comprehend a $9 pour of wine that is 5oz. It literally comes in a small plastic cup that wouldn't even be satisfactory if you were drinking water. The bartender was very nice and understanding of our frustration and said she gets similar complaints all the time. Go for the service not for the drinks."}
{"text":"Wine is good, food is good... I have never met ruder people in my life than the staff here. The female bartender covered in tattoos was downright surly and acted like it was totally uncool to wait on customers. I will never go back for this reason. I don't see how this place can stay in business."}
{"text":"This place is super cute. Great spot to come and chill on their patio and have a drink. Very chill environment. Plus let's just say their Lobster Grilled Cheese is amazing! Also I read a sign that said bottomless rose Sunday's for under $20! Who can beat that"}
{"text":"The charcuterie is a must and the apple cider is literally to die for!!!  A thumbs up to Naomi, Nicole and David for the service and making it a special experience at the Container Park."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Container Park. Goal to have drinks with a little food. Our Baccalaureate party ended up at The Bin. The atmosphere and music was great. The staff friendly. Drinks great and not too expensive. You must try the grilled lobster and cheese sandwich.  Lasty we did some impromptu bloody mary testing. Just an overall great time!"}
{"text":"Okay drinks. Terrible service.  Bartender with the pink hair was very rude. Beers they \"had on tap\" were not actually available. Kind of lame."}
{"text":"REALLY LOVELY PLACE.

Came in for a respite from the rain and cold and enjoyed the place to ourselves. Very tiny and intimate. Fantastic music playing, very mellow indie rock not too loud.

Friendly service and great drinks. Didn't try the food, but noticed it was very well curated--only a few things are on offer, and they're made from scratch in house, so it appears quality control is in place.

Seems like a lovely place to come early with a small group of friends to take over a corner or to come huddle with just one close friend."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going into this establishment.  The BLT wrap is so amazing that I think about it from time to time and make a special trip down to the Container Park to obtain it.  The staff is always friendly, especially April, and we always get consistent service and food.  The drinks are great as well.  I think the prices are very fair and I don't have an issue with the size of the place - the air conditioner works well and it is a wonderful spot to hang out for a few minutes to get out of the heat or to wait on friends that want to join up downtown or for a quick meal on the go.  

P.S. - for those who wonder about the plastic cups - it is so you can take your drink and walk around.  If you don't want to walk around, tell them you are sitting in and they will gladly give you a glass.  They often ask me if I am \"staying or going\" and that is how I realized they had full glassware."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place in the Container Park. (Well, duh, they're all little.) They have wine, beer, and cocktails - and the good kind. They also have a small menu. The fancy smancy grilled cheeses are the highlight here. They also have some happy hour deals. There's some seating inside and then there's more seating on their patio. It's a good place to stop in for a drink and/or quick bite. Service is usually always friendly and attentive too."}
{"text":"Say cheese! Grilled cheese. I had the brie and apple. My husband had the flaming hot. Both were really good though it was a consenses mine was better. White sangria very yummy. Service a bit on the slow side."}
{"text":"In love with this place. It's our first time on a Sunday! The service was exceptional. The sandwiches were amazing & the games were fun. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"I was up the street for an event and snuck away because I was STARVING. The BBQ place was sold out if everything, as per usual, so I gave this place a try in the hopes it would be good and quick.  

Quick, yes. Good? Nope. The point of a panini is to be all squished and hot and melty. My (WAAAAAAAAAAY overpriced) turkey and brie panini was none of those things. There was like one slice of Brie on the whole thing, the turkey was so jam packed that it was still cold. If I'm paying $13 for and EFFING SANDWICH, Brie better be smooshing out the side and onto the table, not cheap deli meat!! Also, my overpriced wine was underpoured. 

I'm still sitting at the table outside on a busy night, and I literally want to tell people to keep walking. This place sucks. I shoulda gone to Subway at El Cortez. 

1 star for speediness."}
{"text":"The three people that work here ( David , Nicloe, Kai )  were awesome . Great place for a small bite to eat and drinks on a hot summer night."}
{"text":"Screw the impatient impossible customers that left bad reviews for this wonderful downtown edition. I really enjoyed some amazingly delicious food here. The service is a little off par and somewhat slow, but it's a very small restraint manned by 1-2 people at most, who put a lot of care and time into each dish (beautiful additions on each plate that enhance the aesthetic) which I'm sure is stressful even when the place is half full. The cheese platter was SO freaking good, the Turkey and Brie sandwich served to us by accident turned out to be my Favorite (comes with sliced pickles and a small salad garnished with a bright exotic fruit slice) ; there's this amazing jam spread on it which really brought the whole thing together. The wine list was impressive and held a few surprising gems, though a tad overpriced. We ordered a bottle and drank out of wine glasses ( I don't understand the plastic cup reviews, unless they ordered it to go?) 
All in all in looking forward to my next visit !"}
{"text":"Had the turkey and brie panini. GREAT tasting sandwich. The bread they use is really good, and the meat on the sandwich tastes high quality and they're pretty generous with how much they put on. The aioli was really nice too. Only problem I have with this place is their sandwiches are waaay overpriced in my opinion. Paid about $16 for a small sandwich (that was the cost of the sandwich plus $2 tip)"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the first time yesterday and the vibe is definitely great. Nice outdoor seating, rooftop area for those wanting a better, quieter view. 

Prices were okay for happy hour. It's a better deal if you go for a whole bottle of wine, but none of my friends wanted Malbec 

I ordered a vodka press, and to be honest, it wasn't very good. Just not the right mix. As for the food, I really wish I would've gotten the cheese fries, they looked amazing. 

The grilled cheese with hot cheeto spread was super greasy and not much of a hot cheeto flavor. Really was hoping for more of a kick. 

And lastly, service, yikes. The service here is pretty terrible. Waited pretty much forever for everything. They don't have a designated wait staff outside which makes me wonder why they even have staff running back and forth if they can't keep up. 

Hopefully this place makes it, everything in Container Park tends to come and go."}
{"text":"I love everything about this bar! The wine and beer selections are spot on and they have the best hot spiced Jameson cider I've ever had. Naomi and Taryn were behind the bar and were very helpful with their extensive product knowledge. There was great music playing, the vibe was wonderful and the food menu offered a lobster grilled cheese sandwich. Enough said."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails. Amazing food. Amazing staff. GM Sarah Lynch is the best. Definitely one of my favorite downtown hangouts."}
{"text":"Cute place!!!  I love the entire Container Park.  Their patio deck was the perfect Oasis from our busy Vegas trip.  We enjoyed a bottle wine that was perfectly priced and good.  Their overall selection looked amazing, not a huge wine list, but something for everyone.  We also ordered their mini sandwiches, and after not being able to make a choice the server chose the best ones for us.  Cute finger sandwiches which were very filling for lunch.  We are hoping to stop back by later in our trip.  They have happy hour that starts at 3."}
{"text":"This has been a go to of my for a good while. The meat & cheese plate is great, along with their grilled cheese sandwiches! Recently my boyfriend and I went and had great service and of course, top quality service and  grilled cheeses!  We, of course, bragged about it and sharing photos with our friends. We went out last night to enjoy the weekend shenanigans at DTLV. As the drinks and night rolled on, so did the need for food. Everyone we brought wanted these grilled cheeses. 

1st problem my boyfriend encountered. Our order was written on a napkin, not put in the computer. We waited, socialized. It was fairly busy when we first got there, around 11:10 but hey, it's Saturday on in the Fremont area, we wouldn't expect less. It died down before we ordered however. 30 minutes pass, we are tired AND hungry. I go see what's going on. The bartender was too busy chatting w three gentleman and partaking in their sampling of beers. Took another 5 minutes before I was next. I asked how much longer for the food and handed my receipt. This was accepted with an \"Oh shit! She didn't make your food??\" Um, excuse me? The line behind her was void of the person who was making the sandwiches and she had to text her for her whereabouts. Lord knows where she was (busy stocking, I was told). Please note, I wasn't looking for free food or some sort of comp. An apology, a sincere apology could have done it. But apparently I \"should have come and nudged us! We make them pretty quick!\" Why should I be aware of the timing you know you need to provide good service??? Anyway, I asked to be refunded and was told again, I should ask in the future to make sure food is on its way. I said, there probably won't be a next time. She was null of giving a crap.

She didn't need the card for the refund nor did we receive a receipt of the reversed transaction. So I will be making sure we actually get the money back. 

Another table was complaining about not having food yet as we were leaving (we were 5 people, who ordered the 12 mini deals) that party was larger and they pretty much saw the whole thing go down. They probably didn't get their food either.  I was pretty disappointed in the situation overall and the bartenders failure to provide good customer service. 

So glad we tipped cash for service and food never received."}
{"text":"A group of us came here for lunch after the color run. The container park was packed with people so we were lucky to find a place. The lobster grilled cheese written on the window is what drew in all the guys in our group. 

We sat on a couch area outside which was nice, probably would have been nicer if it wasnt 52 degrees outside but there was a heater that the server turned on for us. 

Most of us ordered the lobster grilled cheese. I thought it was ok, not something extremely amazing or different. It was packed with lobster meat but I think it was processed, definitely didn't taste fresh. I don't think I would order it again.

So why 4 stars?..our server was amazing. She  was all alone and she was still running in the back to help the People cook and prep the food. She was apologetic and as attentive as she could be all alone. Service definitely makes or breaks an experience.....she made mine!"}
{"text":"My first time here and it was an absolute pleasure! The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable,  and patient with my novice questions about beers.  Sarah and the crew were very professional and you can't beat the lication. Easy access to the outside music. Kudos and good vibes!"}
{"text":"It was my first time at the container park hanging with some 808 Ohana and my two nieces. Downtown in general spot that normally avoid. Only because not fan of dealing with the whole downtown parking or the distance from my house just keeping it real yelpers. loll. 

While hanging out at the container park for few hours started to get hungry. Thankfully talk about LOT of options comes to food. We started with some solid day drinking got some beer at bin 702. We checked out the menu but since just got there decided stick with the nice craft bottle beer. I forgot the name but it was grapefruit style beer that was tasty. I look over the menu quick notice lot of sandwiches, some anti pasta or charcuterie board, and some other options. The kitchen not really kitchen. It more small deli sandwich kind of set up behind the bar area. So the menu not that big but never been fan of huge menu. Diversity can be great thing in restaurant business. Sometimes keep it simple small and high quality take it all day. I ended up getting the Flamin Hot Cheetos Grilled Cheese. Come on start grilled cheese sandwich. What not to LOVE about that??? Cheetos that peaked my interest I was impressed!!! It definitely kicked grilled cheese sandwich up few notches. The bread was amazing. They use panini style pressed looks like on most of the sandwiches or my grilled cheese they did. The bread is nice crusty, crispy, and the perfect crunch bite dive into great sandwich. The cheese and the cheetos (most of it crush up fine on the outside of the bread) gives the sandwich not only different look but adds another flavor never had before in sandwich. Just perfect light/just right size sandwich enjoy beautiful outdoor weather had that day. 

The service thought was fabulous!!! Friendly. We were chilling with my friends kids out by the stage area with fake grass and lego blocks and other building foam things for the kids. They brought our food out no problems. They do have some indoor dining and outdoor seating. 

So not doubt if looking for something on the lighter side while hanging out at the container park bin 702 is great spot!!!!"}
{"text":"This was a great place! Service was wonderful and attentive! We had montaditos! They were amazing and our waitress was the best! Definitely come down here!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and the spinach lobster salad was amazing!!  We will come back for more!  For sure..."}
{"text":"These guys are off to a good start in the container park which is a must see. They were out of a few things that I wanted to try and could have been a little more friendly, but it is a cool build out and they have some decent wine and eats."}
{"text":"Bin 702 is located in Container Park and, as a wine bar, it is just about perfect.

It has an excellent selection of wines and craft beers (and ciders, and homemade sangria) and a terrific small plates menu, too.  Service was cheerful and attentive.

We ordered at the counter and sat on the cozy patio furniture just outside the entrance.

For food, we ordered the mini-bin (two gourmet meats and one delicious cheese with warm, toasted bread) and two montaditos (mini-sandwiches) that were not so mini and were absolutely wonderful (the turkey one was just as good as my beloved Cuban, the world's greatest sandwich).  

You get good quantities of very, very good food and very good wine at fair prices.  It's not dirt cheap but it is great stuff.

This place is a winner."}
{"text":"I was hot and getting cranky and just wanted something tasty and satisfying. I had wanted to try somewhere new, and had gone to another restaurant inside Container Park, and was pretty much ignored so I left and came to bin 702. I have been here a few times in the past, just for drinks, and always have enjoyed myself. In the past I have never gotten food here so this time was a first. I love the cute little inside and took a seat at the end of the bar. Started off with a local draft beer, Loveladys 9th Island, which I've had before, but on a hot day, it was a nice start! 
I was starving so I didn't waste time ordering their green salad and a 2 meat and 1 cheese plate. When that arrives I also ordered a Left Hand Milk Stout, on draft (Nitro). 
My meats were a truffle salumi and bresaola, my fave! I can't recall the name of the cheese but it was good. The plate included some bread and whole grain mustard. Everything was just perfect. I can't resist whole grain mustard! The salad was bigger than expected and delicious! Avocado was perfect. 
I ended up here bc of poor service elsewhere and I couldn't have been happier. The service was great and genuine. The beer selection was great and I can't wait to get come back and try some of the little grilled cheeses."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is every day at bin 702 from 3pm to 6pm, and they offer $5 beers, $6 spirits, $7 wines. Not a bad deal at all. I came to bin 702 to grab a quick bite and drink. 

The food to me was mediocre in terms of quality and taste. I enjoyed the drinks, however, and the prices for the alcohol can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Love this new spot at The Container Park! Nestled downtown in the center of the container park on level 1 is a need to stop bar.

Offering delicious craft cocktails (some on tap like Tanners Bitchface) delicious gourmet sandwiches all for affordable prices. The best part is the service behind the bar. Fast, knowledgeable and so friendly. That rewally makes it all the more fun to stop by for a drink or two.

Outdoor or indoor seating is available. I prefer to take my cocktail outside and people watch. If you find yourself downtown, a trip to this bar is worth the sip and nibble."}
{"text":"The hospitality at this place is awesome ! Great drinks and wine list, the meets and cheese felt like they didn't really have a taste, but the small paninis  are pretty good. They have a nice indoor and outdoor seating. Will definitely be back for happy hour."}
{"text":"Bin 702 is where my girlfriend and I had our first spontaneous date over a year ago and last night we made it back for a quick glass of wine.  Expecting the same amount of selection and service we happily trotted over from \"Glutton\" across the street for a bit of nostalgia and a night cap to end the evening...I wish we wouldn't have. 

 Although it has been a while since we have been there, things have totally changed for the worse.  Small plastic cups for the wine, of which there were actual glasses but we were not offered any.  The Bartender said, \"Oh you wanted glasses? We have them I am just in auto mode giving out the plastic cups for everyone else.\"  What???  Hey I get that it is downtown and the \"daiquiri in large funnel crowd\" is just up the street but it was later in the evening on a Tuesday and we are locals.  The wine selection is mediocre at best out of the tap, and they have gone to a much more cocktail and beer focus.  Maybe things weren't selling as well as they liked and they decided to go with what keeps the doors open...again I get that we all have to make a buck, but this place has gone seriously down hill.  The only redeeming factor of the place is that it is near the stage and has an outdoor patio to hang out on.  Good for parents who want to let the kids roam and dance and play, just not for people who expect more than the average store bought 8$ bottle of wine in a plastic cup.  Sorry Bin 702, you had something once but that is surely gone now."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner and drinks on a trip. There was one other restaurant I was considering going to in Container Park, but came here instead because prices were a bit better. Tried the Cuban grilled cheese and the Token Salad which were both good, but not amazing. If I came here again, I would stick to their specialties--the montaditos and boards.

They had a few good beers on tap and I tried two local beers. The service was very good. Overall, going to bin 702 was a good experience and fit right in with the atmosphere of Container Park."}
{"text":"I was in the area for work, decided to check out the Container Park. Bin 702 had happy hour specials and an inviting patio, with heaters. I was pleasantly surprised to find a great drink selection on happy hour, including beer, wine and liquor. There is no food available on special, but the service was great and the area is definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I decided to try this spot b4 my Neon Museum Tour because I haven't had a cheese toast in awhile.  OMG!!!!!!!!!!!!   That seafood cheese toast made me cry.  Have u ever eaten something that was so good u just wanted to cry??   Well I have and almost did tonight.  It was so delicious.  The 2 ladies who took my order were nice and friendly.  I am glad I made the decision to go here.  They have limited indoor seating but great seating outdoors plus u are in Vegas who wants to eat inside anyway.  I also had the white sangria and it was delish too.  Perfect way to compliment your sandwich."}
{"text":"I am reading these reviews and I am flabbergasted by the rude comments.  This place is awesome and if you have a problem maybe you should chat with the owner who is always there...


I have been to Bin 702 4 times...and  I have no complaints

Each time I have been during peak hours

Maybe it's because I own a bar myself and I know how difficult it is to run an establishment in this city....

I have eaten dinner there twice...we always order the cheese plate and we always get extra bread....we tried the lobster roll this last time...it was spicy but good.

I always drink the pinot grigio...its the best I have ever had.

The staff is attentive, the bartenders are always nice and funny...I have never encountered an apathetic employee

Props to Bin 702...you've got a great operation and it'll only get better as time goes on."}
{"text":"This place is fine.  The food is tasty and the portions are good.  The menu is just the right size - not too big, not too small.  The staff was very nice and the interior was clean.  The prices were steep, but what do you expect?  

I don't think it deserves rave reviews (zzzOMG this place is like so hip and so totally awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!), nor does it deserve the \"I'm-so-cool-and-hip-and-this-place-is-far-below-my-sophisticated-NYC-standards\" knocks either."}
{"text":"Exorbitantly priced for what you get. $9 for a basic grilled cheese (that is fairly lacking on any depth of flavor in either the bread or the cheese), and another $9 for a draft beer. I felt like I got a much better experience at Perch."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting the Downtown Container Park and I loved it!  We decided to stop into bin 702 before heading to Park on Fremont for dinner.  What a great idea and such a cute space!  The staff was very welcoming, the space was simple but very CA, the wine was tasty and the cheese/meat board was perfect.  What a great place to visit on date night and enjoy a nibble and a nice glass of wine."}
{"text":"Great patio space, grilled cheese sandwiches, and happy hour deals in Container Park. We ordered the Hot Cheeto and turkey mini sandwiches. Both were tasty, and the service was very friendly. Only downside was the wait - maybe it was an off day, but it took 20-30 minutes to get 2 mini sandwiches. Overall a fun, open spot to have a drink and a bite on a nice day."}
{"text":"Really nice little spot! Popped in during the workday for my dads birthday with the office, had enough seating for the 8 of us at tables, and not the bar, which was perfect! Beautiful little sandwiches, pleasant salad (only 1 kind) and everything was good!! HOT CHEETOS sandwiches and grilled cheese - omg. Cute little spot, nice and cool even in the summer, full bar, and didn't have a drink myself but they looked delicious!!! Waitress was super sweet an accommodating! Made sure to take care of the birthday boy and it was lovely!! Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Cute name, check.  Hipster location, check.  Overall experience...well...

If you're going to advertise a kale salad, and you're going to charge $9 for it, you better damn well make sure you're serving KALE in the salad.  Not just romaine (it was billed as a \"kale romaine blend\").  Unless \"local kale\" in Vegas is light green, ridged, and looks and tastes exactly like romaine, I was served a romaine salad on a paper plate with a plastic fork.  Yes, really.

If you can get past the salad faux pas, there are some little gems here at the bin - a lovely cheese plate with raw honeycomb and home baked bread (my weakness), some tasty cured meats (fennel salami FTW), and some majorly delicious beers (I ordered a run-of-the-mill saison and our \"in the know\" waitress brought me a Goose Island Matilda on the sly, which made me feel like a cool underground hipster).

Would I go back?  In a pinch, and for a beer, sure.  But if you want a high-star rating out of me you better not lie about your salad fixins - not cool, bin 702.   Not cool."}
{"text":"From the awesome service to the delicious cocktails .... to the brie sandwich, this place rocks!!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and the girls behind the counter are great.  Decent beer selection.  We didn't eat this time but the food coming out of the kitchen look amazing!"}
{"text":"Bin 702 always has a great happy hour with $5 drink specials form 3-6pm.  The entire month of June Downtown Container Park is having Country music every Friday so the live entertainment is a huge plus factor.  The stage is steps  away from the bin."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day outing with my daughters.
Super overpriced and the lobster roll I've wanted since they opened, didn't taste like real lobster at all. Maybe it's white fish / pretend lobster (like you get at the grocery store). A lobster roll, tiny beer & 2 tiny root beers came to $35 or so. Yeah.
I added the extra star for how unbelievably sweet  the chick behind the counter was (Sooooo nice) & how  efficient their \"chef\" was. But I can't excuse the joint and give them a higher rating for having a good staff.
The place just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"I haven't had a chance to try the food yet, but the drinks are reasonably priced. Staff are really friendly!"}
{"text":"I came here the other day for lunch and got the Turkey and Brie panini, it was amazing! I'm not the biggest fan of turkey but I wanted to choose something \"safe\" to try since they didn't have a lot of options. This was anything but safe, it was a delicious surprise. So flavorful and perfectly toasted! 

I can't wait to come back for wine and to try their other dishes and platters! 

Also, their staff is extremely pleasant and helpful. Container park is a fun atmosphere to be in!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Container Park downtown, some friends and I stopped in at Bin 702 for a snack. They have a nice little Happy Hour menu with some wine and beers. The staff was very friendly and professional. We had the 'The Bin' (3 meat/3 cheese board) which was very tasty but a little on the pricey side at $30. They have indoor and outdoor seating but it was very noisy outside because it's pretty much a kids park outside and kids are running around playing everywhere. If you sit inside, it's small and can get a little warm with the kitchen in the same area. We also had to clear the table from previous patrons so we could sit and noticed that nobody was clearing any tables. We were also told that they were out of plastic ware utensils but luckily a friend had a knife so we could, you know, cut the cheese. 
It was a good break spot but nothing spectacular (Just my opinion). If you happen to be in the area you might want to give them a shot."}
{"text":"Love love. Engaging, attentive service. Unique ambiance. Will recommend again and again. The exact reason I chose to stay downtown. Experience did not disappoint."}
{"text":"We ordered ciders & The Bin special, plus a spinach salad.  The meat & cheese plate was exotic,  super tasty, and very filling! My gf & I shared \"The Bin\" and the Avocado spinach salad. Yum! 

This isn't white tablecloth dining. It's trendy, industrial, funky with a sustainable attitude. Come with an open young mind & you'll leave happy!

Plastic (compost-able) utensils & paper (compost-able) plates. Don't knock it, the food was just a good with plastic silverware!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a secret place in Vegas but it shouldn't be. Great bloody Mary's. Lobster grilled cheese is to die for. And the flaming hot Chito grilled cheeses is one I tried this time and that too is great. Come by if you want something good to go with a great cold beer"}
{"text":"Definitely a good house warming atmosphere I went with a good friend earlier today and it was fantastic, from the service which ( Brianna ) was our bartender and made us feel welcomed, explained the beverages very well and was just so friendly... definitely a chill spot to hang out ! Thank you !!"}
{"text":"Recently moved downtown so on my days off I've been exploring my surroundings. Bin702 is located in container park. It has a wine on tap, great beers and delish sandwiches and wraps.

The turkey and Brie panini is very satisfying. Comes with a side salad and the Brie is nice and warm. It has turkey breast, Brie, apricot jam, lettuce, tomato and house aioli. It hits the spot when your feeling a sandwich.."}
{"text":"Service is incredible! Thank you Naomi! Mini bin cheese and char plate was delicious and the sandwiches are great! House made lobster salad...whaaaaaaaaaat!"}
{"text":"We sauntered down here after brunch at the Perch.  Naomi was the bartender and she was AMAZING & took excellent care of us. Oscar was so kind, and offered us his raincoat to travel to the restroom because it was pouring rain! Such a great bar, great atmosphere and great service. Definitely will return!"}
{"text":"Fun environment, good drink prices. Kids play place right off to the side, and a singer on stage. Came as part of a pub crawl and had fun at our first stop."}
{"text":"Just a great place in container park. A little expensive, but soooo good. The lobster grilled cheese is a must try for everyone."}
{"text":"Relaxed, cute, little bin with yummy food and drinks! I loved the mini sandwiches. The Brie one is delicious. Great for sharing!"}
{"text":"What a perfect place to grab a bite and a beer while the Little's run around on the play ground!

We enjoyed two grilled sandwiches:

Brie with green apple, almonds, wild flower honey & thyme.

& Turkey with Flamin' hot cheeto spread, white cheddar, avo, tomato.

Get the California dreamin beer! I haven't seen it around town so I tried it out. Crisp, light, subtle sweet finish."}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!! A friend and I had their cheese and meet platter. The chef came out and told us about everything on our plate with details from the history about the cheeses to the meats. So worth the experience and am option to try a wide variety of cheese and meats I have never found."}
{"text":"After a long couple of days on the strip, I needed to downshift a bit from the madness. During my day trip to Freemont Street, I was excited to have room to walk and breath (not to mention affordable bottled water, that which did not require a small loan or plasma donation to purchase). With 6 different options of love music available, I continued down the overhead screen until reaching East Freemont and container park. Just pass the adult sized tree house, I saw this inviting little patio within earshot and sight of the nearest music stage. Popped in and found athat delightful food and drink selection, including sangria! Settled in on the patio and began to just enjoy. Accidentally spilled my sangria halfway through. The ladies behind the bar were super kind about it and even refilled my cup to the top. Will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas, and now that I know where it is, ill be able to try a couple more items from the menu. Stay tuned..."}
{"text":"Outstanding watering hole inside Container Park. Great sandwiches and the customer service is outstanding. I would recommend this place to locals and tourists alike."}
{"text":"Dope little spot to stop in for a drink. Pretty good selection of beers and if you're not sure what you want the bartenders can usually recommend something you'll enjoy."}
{"text":"Great place for a drink and a light meal. I loved the mini grilled sandwiches! What a great way to have a meal that is varied and fun without being too big. The beer list was good too. The \"token salad\" was not very good - basically a huge plate of spinach with some walnuts on top."}
{"text":"We ordered wine & cider and the cheese board. The cheese board was ample with candied walnuts, almonds, honey, fog preserve, whole grain mustard, grilled bread, olives and 4 cheeses. The lady bartender was pleasant and helpful and we sat out on the patio. The only downside is the crowds that come with container park, but as a local I think I'm sensitive. When we came it was happy hour so our drinks were reasonable. Nice place if you don't mind listening to the kids playing on the play ground."}
{"text":"If I lived in Vegas I would eat here every dang day! Food and drink is perfect, as is the location in Container Park.  My husband and I are still talking about the lobster grilled cheese months later."}
{"text":"Lunch for 2 people on a Sunday, around 2p.
It was 115 degrees!!!

Had 6 of their mini-sandwiches/paninis. Enough for a light lunch for 2 people. Great flavor, especially how they combined various meats with cheeses. Too bad I couldn't eat the charcuterie plate because it probably would have been awesome!

Customer service: really excellent. We were there late so not many people. So sweet the chef cut the sandwiches in half for us to share."}
{"text":"Already obsessed with this place and I have been once. My friend took me here after work. Man am I happy she did. Bin 702 is a hip place located at container park on Fremont. The place is small inside but also makes up for it by having an awesome outdoor patio with comfortable couches and tables. Defiantly utilized this.

My friend RAVED about the Hot Cheeto Grilled Cheese. The hot cheetos were on top and inside the grilled cheese, which means I HAD to get it. I added avocado to it for something extra. Hands down the BEST grilled cheese I've had in years. I truly mean that. The bread wasn't soggy nor over cooked. Just the right crisp to the sammy. You can easily butcher a grilled cheese sadly and I've had it done to me. 

Perfect amount of cheese on it. Some people are slim with it and some people put so much you can't taste the bread. Well not here, with the \"heat\" of the cheetos this was a great meal. Plus it's served with a really good pickle, who doesn't love a good pickle ;)

The staff there was so chill, didn't bother us and for sure didn't neglect us with their conversations. The happy hour is from 3-6. Small menu with a few draft beers. Easy to make up your mind there. There girls there made an awesome suggestion for my friend and she loved hers too.

Defiantly coming back for another! And another after that."}
{"text":"Most excellent cocktails.   
Kale salad was spot on.  House made dressings.  Small menu: charcuterie panini salads.
Bartender made a spot on Manhattan.   
Come back here again."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars. 

I can at about 12:30 on a Saturday night. I wasn't aware before but the container park closes at 1am so they kind of rushed us in and out. They still served us drinks, in plastic cups, so we could walk around around, but it felt hurried. Their beer selection rotates but offers the usual Vegas scene beers with the micros and a couple Tenaya and Big Dog's. Their cocktails weren't all that creative either. They were about $10 and the usual creations. If looking. For a drink, I'd rather go to Oak and Ivy which is a literal 30 second walk, where you can get knowledgable bartenders and better quality liquor."}
{"text":"This is always my go-to spot in container park. The service is always fast and delightful, and they have something for everyone - from craft beers to craft soda. This is great for a light bite as well, however, I don't think they serve food after 10pm. If you do catch them when the \"kitchen\" is open, their avocado and spinach salad is quite satisfying!"}
{"text":"I am all about second chances, and this is exactly what I did with this place: Giving it a second chance. I have been there a couple of times just because I happened to be going to the container park for various events. The service really bothers me there. Bartender is not exactly the friendliest or caring. Bartenders are at the forefront of your restaurant. They are supposed to be friendly and accommodating. She is far from that and makes you feel like you bother her. Yet, I decided to look past that.

Last time we were there, I brought in a  group of people, ordered drinks and then sat at tables inside. Be mindful of the following facts:
- The bar/restaurant is inside a container = Small space, limited room to move around
- The purpose of the business is to serve food and drinks to as many customers as possible in order to remain open and generate revenue

Obviously, confined space and lots of customers poses a challenge and should be something that the owners of the place would have to learn to deal with, right?
Nope! My group was rudely reprimanded for talking to each other across tables by who I assume is the manager or/and co-owner. Even though, we were considerate enough to make sure that she could walk by, she got aggravated and threatened us that she would have to force us to move to other seats.
I get it, she needs room to move around, but diplomacy should be in order when you're dealing with a larger group that spent good money on overpriced, low quality and very undersized poured drinks and wines ($10 to $14 for wine, $3 for water, for example). It simply resulted in a change of plan and my whole group moved on to friendlier pastures. 

I am very respectful of people and was taught to be polite, always say thank you and again, be considerate of others. Something that is not standard practice at bin 702."}
{"text":"After being away for a 1.5 yrs for the Bin and Las Vegas, I came back today with a A.G.M. with an attitude. I walked in with my 1.5 year old in my arms and asked for a Chardonnay. The bartender (A.G.M. lady with long blond hair with attitude) asked if I minded a wine out of the tap. I said no and she spouted out the Blanc instead of Chard. I didn't mention it. She said $11 for the wine and I said I don't recall last week that it was that much and also I thought I got something out of a bottle for less. Well that kinda hit her nerve then it was all down hill from there. She thought I was calling her out and I  explained maybe it was my baby mind that I was confused since I was holding my 15 month old. Anyways she became cold and basically rude. She touted she was the AGM and then I touted I have been coming here 6 years and I don't remember the wine coming out of the tap. Most likely because I always came with a friend or friends and just payed the bill without noticing the pour or price. I was just trying to make conversation after that but she became irritated and made me feel uncomfortable. Being that she was in a position of management and i was a loyal customer she should have been a little more understanding that the customer was confused possibly and backed down. Obviously she was in a bad mood. After I agreed I would take a half carafe and she would pour 3 glasses for $25 instead of 1 for $11 I took the Blanc even though I ordered Chardonnay not wanting to piss her off anymore then she was. After coming  back in to ask for my 3rd glass of the carafe she rudely told me \"this is your last one\" I kinda laughed and walked out with my daughter. Here I am a local with many places  to spend my money and really  enjoying the Bin  I felt like if I was the Owner I would have told her to find another job right then and there. This is my last time to visit Bin 702 when I can walk 50 ft away to the next bar and get better service without attitude. Thanks A.G.M..im sure if the owners knew that you didn't care about \"their\" customers I'm sure you would have another job. Being rude to customers even if the Customer might not get it, doesn't give you the right to take away 6 years of good experience because you woke up with a bad attitude."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! With the gimmick of \"wine on tap\" your going to have a hard time finding a better casual wine bar in town. I cant get away from the Gernache Blend. Its a California Red, and wow is it amazing. It reminds me of a soft cab, but with a heavy finish. Ive tried the Riesling, pinot grigio, and one other red, im blanking on the name, and all of these wine choices were great. My boyfriend tried a few beers and loved them as well. 
The manager Kat is a doll. she provided us with great service. They dont have any gluten free options on their menu but if you ask the cook nicely he will make you a sandwich in a lettuce wrap instead. I had the turkey and brie, wow that was yummy. 
Its a very small space but they make do with what they have. This was by far the best service and wine selection in the Container Park."}
{"text":"Service is FANTASTIC!!! We visited on 7/11/17 for our Anniversary and my husbands Bday and the 2 girls working were awesome!!! Both made us feel welcome and had a great time! We had great drinks and the food is fantastic! I have to say my favorite part of my visit was what appeared to be maybe a homeless man come in and get water out of the dispenser they had on the bar and the bartender was clearly treating him like every other customer in the bar.  Made the experience even better! Thanks to the girl working on 7/11 Day!!!"}
{"text":"Based on F&b and experience, I had a 4 star experience. Ordered the Cheese Platter. Came out with Brie, Bleu, Goat Bleu, and a sharp cheddar. The accompaniments were great. Crisp bread, olives, house spiced mixed nuts & homemade dried cranberries or raisins. Great honey. Apricot jam. Everything tasted great in different mixes, the cheeses were complimented very well. 

I enjoyed the ambiance and our server was attentive. 

Tried the Dolcetta, tasted fruit-juicey, to me. Too light. Ordered the Cabernet- it was good with the cheese platter. Would love more selection of bold wines, they have a great beer menu, 7 whites and 5 reds to choose from. Maybe due to space concerns? Looking for a big bold wine was my main concern for 4 stars instead of 5. They had a broader white wine menu for those white wine lovers out there. I imagine with Summer around the corner, the red wine menu will stay put.

I can see how it would get crowded quickly here, but we had no problem around 2pm on a weekday.

If it was crowded in bin 702 I wouldn't sit down for a nice little meal and glass of wine, as that is an experience that I want to enjoy without rush.  I would grab a cheaper beer and set off to enjoy the life and sounds at the park. 

All in all, they did a good job, respectable craftsmanship, creative menu and I left happy.  I hope these businesses stay busy, the DCP is a great refuge in Vegas and I hope it thrives."}
{"text":"Visited the container park for the first time after a failed attempt to do zipline a few nights ago. my friend and I walked around and left. I came back to do zipline today and was intrigued by the Lobster grilled cheese. I'm glad I decided to take a chance because it was absolutely amazing. Firstly, the container park idea is cool in itself. Secondly, the server Taryn, who was also the bartender, cook and apparently has a beer in her honor was super sweet. She fulfilled drink orders, including mine, made my sandwich and everything by herself. She was literally the only person working at the time. Awesome. Lastly, but certainly not least, the sandwich. Delicious!!! I'm not really a huge fan of smoked gouda and wish it were a different cheese (maybe Meunster) but honestly, I didn't care. It was good enough. The Lobster Grilled Cheese Sandwich is absolutely incredible! I was torn between picking this place or Evel pie. I'm not saying Evel pie is bad because I didn't try it, but it would have to be some truly epic pizza to top what I had. I also had a cider beer (Seattle Cider) which was ok but as someone who's tried quite a few cider beers (which I like way better than regular beer now) it wasn't at the top of the list. Not only would I come back when in Vegas, this place might just be one of those \"must have\" places whenever I return. It was that good."}
{"text":"I love the setting , the interior, and the vibe, it is all really nice. I have been here 5 times and my experiences tend to be different so I hesitated to write a review as there can always be an off night. The last visit sealed my review because I now realise it is so inconsistent that I would rather not suggest bin 702 if I were to meet a group. if I was with one other person and we were passing and it was not busy then great.

First of all, it is really small, it is in a container so there is not a lot of space inside. The other night it was in the 40's and cold, there were no outside heaters so that was not an option. We went inside and there was a place to sit however both bartenders were with a group of 8, we sat at a table and waited for them to be served. Another group came in, and again both bartenders went to work on their order. It was disappointing not to be acknowledged but to be entirely overlooked, not good.

I have had wine there in the Spring and sat outside it was a complete delight. There were $7 dollar glasses available and that is fair,however the plastic cups are not my favorite and need to go if I am paying $10. 

I like bin 702, it just needs a little refinement to make it a go to spot."}
{"text":"The sandwiches were so good and very affordable. The staff was great! The drinks we're excellent as well. The whole container park is unique and a great place to grab a drink and some grub. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was here back in January. My wife reserved a spot to hang out with friends for the night and the employees there were very accommodating. The service throughout the night was great as they stopped by frequently to make sure we had everything we needed, cleared plates and glasses, etc. Prices for wines by the glass were more than reasonable, certainly cheaper than the Strip. The only food I sampled was the meat and cheese trays. Both were filled with a good variety of items. It's a cozy spot that worked well in the winter, as it never got too cold in there even with the doors open."}
{"text":"YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(347/365) \"Hot Cider For Sure!\"

Walking around Container Park one evening, we came upon bin 702. I can't comment on the food though, because we just  stopped by for a drink. At the time, they were offering holiday inspired drinks, including their take on Spiced Cider.

It was also kinda nippy out, so that spiced cider sounded great! The taste as pretty good, but after my first sip, I had a little coughing spell from the kick of cayenne pepper. Man, was it strong! That definitely put the spice in spiced cider!

Looking at the food pictures makes me want to return to try their edible options  the next time we're in the neighborhood.  ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Good for the price. Not classy by any stretch of a delusional imagination. But chill place to kick back with descent prices. Go as you like and drink/eat... Then move on to next party place."}
{"text":"Meh. When there is a gruner vetliner on the menu for $11 when the bottle is a little bit more than that price, I get a little turned off--and I know my wine. Also, happy hour only M-W. What?! Um, the wine isn't that special for me to return for full priced small pours. I know y'all just opened but take it from a Napa girl born and raised, you should offer a better happy hour--every day of the week, or at least give me a decent pour. Servers were not attentive on the night I came, and there were only 5 people in there. I'll be back to try again, and hope for better service, otherwise, I'll start being a loyalist to the Hostile Grape."}
{"text":"The miniature sandwiches were amazing.  They gave us an opportunity to try everything on the menu.  Go for the 12 that way you get everything."}
{"text":"TLDR: moderately priced drinks, par service, room temperature white wines, servers are not too happy to be working 

This quaint little side bar is located inside the infamous Container Park in Downtown Las Vegas. I'm fairly certain it's the same owner as Oak & Ivy, but there is surely a different clientele and service here at Bin 702. They have only 3 beers on draught and several wines to choose from. To accompany your libations, there are montaditos, soups, salads, and charcuterie to enjoy. They smell divine from afar, but I'm certain their charcuterie is not made in-house. 

The unhappy woman server with the lip ring and hooded sweatshirt seems to continue her mundane tasks of cloth-drying the cups as the flies enter the facility because the air curtain is off. Overall, this restaurant seems to not hold up to the standard that their rhetoric actually portrays. 

Who serves room temperature moscato, this place. Can I interest you in some ice cubes to accompany your drink that I forgot to chill? I guess since it's already poured and I feel almost obliged to accept. Needless to say, we will not be returning."}

{"text":"After getting off a restaurant shift at a nearby restaurant, a coworker and I decided to swing by bin702 for some wine and wine related snacks. I couldn't have been happier with my experience. Upon entering we we'd greeted by a friendly staff, a bubbly pink haired server named April, and their master chef Deena, who gave us a run through of the menu. Deena made some recommendations and soon we decided on the meat and cheese plate ($20) and a caprese salad ($8). We sat down at one of the few bar tables and anxiously awaited our snacks. 

Deena brought out a heaping meat and cheese selection and a colorful caprese salad. She explained each item in detail and suggested pairings. Nicky, the lovely mixologist, offered a sampling of their bellagria (white peach moscato) and The Last Word (a marvelous gin concoction that they served chilled on tap). 

I could easily ramble all day about how amazing this place is, but I'll save you the reading and put it simply: \"Honey, wear that cute black dress, I'm taking you on a date to bin702. This adorable wine and cheese bar at the container park\". You're welcome."}
{"text":"What a great little find. My friends and I were wondering through Container Park looking for a place to have a drink. We came across Bin 702. Made up of two shipping containers fused together, with indoor and outdoor seating. We didn't have any food (mainly because we were eating all day) but the have some great nibbles. April, our friendly sweet and knowledgeable bartender recommended drinks that were out of this world. I had an old fashion.  Due check out this space when in downtown Vegas, it's a must."}
{"text":"Best feaking sandwich ever. My wife and I each ordered a sandwich and slit them. They were the best sandwiches ever. And the staff was fucking awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great beers on tap and pair them up with the Montaditos mini sandwiches. They will not disappoint!!"}
{"text":"Monday June 2, 2014 - 2pm The food was a 10+, the service was -0!!!! We were hardly greeted as we came in, the place was not busy. The waitress acted as if she was doing us a favor by taking our order. The waitress, bar tender and cook (3females) acted as if we walked into their personal homes and treated us as unwelcome guests. We order the lobster roll and the spinach salad. Both were exceptional! The place was charming but the help was less than charming. We paid and said keep the change, which was a generous tip especially considering the lack of service. Not even a thank you from waitress!!!!
The people responding to the negative wait staff and saying the service is great, are obviously friends or staffers themselves. The reactions to the comments  are way to personal to be \"Joe Schmo\" customer review."}
{"text":"Pros: Charcuterie plate, friendly service
Cons: None that I can think of

This is a really cool wine bar located inside the new downtown Container Park. Came here for an afternoon snack with Kristin B and bin 702 is just a nice place to chill and people watch at the park. We ordered the Charcuterie Platter for $17 and it came with a really nice selection of meats and we paired that with some of their wines on tap. I had the Cabernet Sauvignon for $12 a glass and it was a nice complement to the food. The service was really friendly here too and they gave us good wine recommendations."}
{"text":"Have been here twice. First time for drinks with friends from Canada! This time with just my husband and our son. We had lunch here and it was great! The girls working the bar and food prep are upbeat, personable and very helpful! We will be going back for sure!! Try everything!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and there is a huge children's park right outside but your kids cannot eat here!!!!!!! Only 21 and up in the middle of the day even. Ate here with my 17 year old daughter and paid went out to patio and security guard told us she couldn't eat on premises. I can walk anywhere in Las Vegas with a beer in my hand but my daughter can't sit down and eat. She can sure pay for it though . Wow so I can buy the food but not eat it there because of over zealous security guard. If u like kids, stay away make them go out of business. Stay away as the whole container park with its cool play structures r only meant to look at!!!"}
{"text":"The crew here was lively and quick to pour a good drink. They are the pulse of the New Vegas. Watch out for guest bartenders--great people but they may give too much head on the beer. 

All kidding aside. The Cab Mushroom Grilled Cheese is amazing. I hate mushrooms but my friends got it and they were spot on. Absolutely the best item on the menu. 

Come down, be a local and enjoy the Container Park."}
{"text":"The tattoo parlor opens at 12 noon.

It's 11:35am.

As I stroll through Container Park on a beautiful Halloween weekend morning, eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to permanently scar my body with a nerd alert, I see the sign: hot Jameson mulled apple cider. With no voice and really nothing to lose, I saunter over to bin 702 and do it!

Curiosity gets the best of me with the montaditos (mini wiches). Although the kind server tells me the Cuban is of course very popular, I've had Cuban sandwiches a bit too commonly in order for me to pass up some of the other, more 'exotic' offerings. I choose the bresaola with gorgonzola (ughhhhh such a blue cheese sluuuut) and honey; she chooses the cab mushrooms.

Opting to sit outside and soak in the shaded sunshine, I recognize that bin 702 is indeed a hipster's paradise: craft cocktails, AMAZING beer selection, limited menu surrounding meat and cheese and small charcuterie platters, peppered with interest-piquing artistic expressions and deliberately mismatched outdoor furniture. I love it. I'm too old to give any f's about what is considered \"cool\" by the kids these days. It's comfy, homely, friendly, and now that my order is out, it's also yummy!

Though the sandwiches could use *slightly* more seasoning across the board, WHAT ADORABLE LITTLE FINGER WICHES!!! Smoked gouda is perfection with the mushrooms, and whoever first paired gorgonzola with honey definitely also knows where a woman's g-spot is. And that cider! Truly did help cure my missing voice and sore throat.

I dig you, bin 702. Keep on doing you."}
{"text":"The tiny sammiches are so cute and so good. I had the Cuban no cheese. The bread is soft on the inside and crunchy on the inside. The ration of filling is perfect, not too much meat not too much bread. The bf got the grilled cheese with flaming hot cheeto spread. He loved it. I didn't try it. I did try the turkey with Gruyere. So good I don't normally eat cheese but this was smoking and creamy. Delicious"}
{"text":"This place is awesome, happy hour is great, really nice location to sit, and really great grilled cheese. They make their own vodka and have some good beers on tap. Delicious food and great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch. I saw an Instagram post for bottomless rose' so we decided to check it out.

For $18 you get unlimited rose' all day, no time limit. If you are dining inside or on the patio you can drink out of a glass. If you want to walk around the park and come back they will give you a cup. They did eventually run out of rose' but we got about 3-4 hours worth.

Seating is limited but there is more seating outdoors.

The bartenders are super friendly."}
{"text":"Cool little spot in the container park. I stopped by here one afternoon for happy hour. I just had a few beers for $5 each. Didn't really get to try anything else here, but the staff was friendly and the air conditioning was nice. The outside patio looked pretty cool if it wasn't 110F outside. I would come back here again."}
{"text":"Meh. Overpriced. Crowded. 

I do understand that in Container Park the establishments are made out of shipping containers, giving business owners the challenge of designing with limited room. However, there are many other businesses on property that do a better job of utilizing the small space.

We sat at the bar, and although we were very conscious of the space around us, there was hardly room behind us and the front door for the servers to squeeze through. It was awkward and annoying being continually bombarded by elbows and purses. It was difficult to enjoy ourselves. We ended up giving up on this and getting our drinks to go. Paying $8 for a Brooklyn Lager, I'd like to be able to get away from the foot traffic outside and sit at the bar for more than a couple minutes. 

I found the bartenders and servers to be completely apathetic about the customers. They served us, but I can't quite say whether they were happy or mad about that. 

We were hungry, but didn't even bother extended our pocket books any more because of the bad introduction to this place. Won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Nice area they out in downtown Vegas. About 20 little shops restaurants. I got the avocado wedge, it was damn good!

Small place, and bartenders are friendly. I'd definitely check this place out again on future trips. 

For you wine junkies, this place might be for you!  They have about 20 wines on tap."}
{"text":"It's a great place to have a glass of wine and a selection of deli meats and cheeses.  Make sure you try the deviled eggs."}
{"text":"I stood at the counter for 3-5 minutes before some offered service. I ordered my grilled cheese sandwich at 7:37PM. I asked one of the ladies working if she could check on my order at 8pm and she said it would be \"soon\", lol. Official time food arrived was 8:02."}
{"text":"Ok, this place deserves 2 different reviews.

It's an easy 4 stars if you're here during the happy hour 3-6pm. Enjoying your 5 dollar beer (cheapest for the whole container park for a craft brew). Sitting on the patio, listening to the live music on a Friday or Saturday night. 

It's a 2 star if you're not here for the live music. Or if you eat the food. Or interacting with the staff. We made the mistake of ordering a pizza once, for 9 dollars we got white bread loaf cut in half, pasta sauce spread on it, and packages shredded mozzarella place on it. It was disgusting."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch the other day & have to say I am disappointed. The menu seems to have shrunk. They have less offerings which given how small the menu was before is pretty bad. My friend and I shared the lobster salad sandwich which was good. There was a large group of what appeared to be zappos people outside. I felt like they dominated the staff's attention. Seems like the fun vibe this place had is going away."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this location at the Container Park. I was on the verge of being hungry, but not quite there yet, so after looking at all the options, I decided on Bin702x 
The Venue is geared for 21 older guest (probably because of all the alcohol options) So while my son played in the park with my husband, I decided to venture inside to check out there menu, since I am not much of a Day time drinker I decided on settling on just grabbing a bite to eat.  The inside is pretty small and quaint and very limited on seating, but luckily there is seats outside on their front porch and if that's taken there is more scattered around the area.  What really made me lean on eating here was the menu, I saw a lobster roll as an option, after seeing how big they were and all the other options they had, I wanted to try everything. So I decided on the minis, I choose the Cuban, Lobster and Flaming hot Cheetos.  They were all good, but were to small to enjoy and purchasing the minis meant changing the bread. I think next time I will have to try the actually Paini sandwich and opt for the more intense grilled cheese style.  I totally recommend trying the full size sandwiches and getting the full effect of the yummy spread and cheese they use."}
{"text":"Four words, flamin hot cheeto sandwich. This sandwich alone earns this place a five stars, but it's not only that it's their other delicious food items along with great beers and awesome service. A few girl friends and I came here during the week around 6 pm and easily found a table inside. 

We ended up sharing the mini bin along with a mixture of 12 different monaditos aka mini sandwiches. This was more than enough food for the four of us. Out of the sandwiches my favorites ended up being the flamin hot cheeto, obviously, the lobster, and the Cuban. I also really enjoyed the mini bin assortment too! Ah and can't forget about the craft beers! I tried the Stiegl grapefruit and the college street, both were very light & fruity. My friends also raved about the Mother Earth. All very good options!

I'm so glad we checked this place out and we'll for sure be back soon!"}
{"text":"Best selection of wine at the Container Park!

The paninis are creative and delicious - so hard to choose which one to try first so I can't wait to go back.  If you go to the Container Park, do not miss this spot!"}
{"text":"Sarah is fucking amazing. It's 3:30pm crowded as fuck and she's handling it like a bar tending pro. The bin702 is the only place I can hang out and have a beer on a Saturday afternoon and not feel crowded. 

No disrespect to the better known \"Oak & Ivy\", but there's no room for a beer and bite. Bin 702 is serving food & alcoholic beverages at a fast pace and keeping your typical LV Downtown crowd happy. Again, another shout out to Sarah, who I've seen the past three times I've been here making everyone happy. Today I watched 3 customers gave her there gratitude for making this bar a fun place to hang out. 

I hope Container Park stays around for a long time and Bin702 is here to stay with them. I couldn't imagine this place without one hip bar that has the room for people to sit down and chill. 

Kudos Sarah and crew."}
{"text":"Our waitress, the food, the sunshine and, well, our waitress makes this Container Park spot a must-visit. I'll blame the booze for forgetting her name (Sonia? Sylvia?) but she's the bad-ass woman with ornate ear gauges who busted her (woman) balls serving, tending and entertaining the entire patio and bar. We ordered a number of crunchy, delicious sandwiches (grilled cheese, turkey and fig jam, reuben) plus The Bin board. Fantastic atmosphere (sunshine in my face, yes) and a wonderful time would bring my business back again."}
{"text":"Awesome find off of the insanity of the strip. After 3 days of overpriced, crappy food, Bin 702 provides a much needed break from $30 hot dogs and waters. Not good for groups (it's really tiny inside), but it seemed like everyone else was grabbing beers to walk around and enjoy the park. 

We had a few beers, cocktails, and grabbed some small plates. Staff was super sweet. Would definitely recommend and will be back on our next trip down. :)"}
{"text":"Had the montadores, which are mini sandwiches, we got twelve, one of each plus an extra of 3. My kids tried the flaming hot Cheeto grilled cheese, they loved it. I loved all of them my husbands favorite was the lobster grilled cheese, mine was the Brie. Next time we are in container park definitely stopping by again. Loved everything, and for those wondering the service was amazing."}
{"text":"Considering their competition in this area, this place did not blow me away. I had the \"Dirty Daiquiri\", it was a decent drink, nothing special. Nothing about this place really made it stand out. Plus, it is decorated like an old style bar, but they were playing EDM/ club music. This really didn't go well with the setting."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. They have a great happy hour for wine and the mini bin is sooooo good. Naomi always helps me and she's amazing. She makes the best sangria , and they pair well with the the mini bin. If your downtown or stopping in the container park , this is the place to go !  Quick , easy and entertaining. Plus they have games."}
{"text":"Real good food. Had the turkey flaming hot cheering. It's not your mom grill cheese sandwich. Different and very tasty."}
{"text":"Wow!!! So love this place! Ryan is a fabulous chef who you can tell truly loves what he does and the food he creates! The meat and cheese platter was fabulous and Sarah hooked us up with great wine suggestions! Loved the vibe and friendliness and will definitely be back to enjoy it again and again!"}
{"text":"Great place it's small not much indoor seating but it has a nice cozy vibe the staff is polite and helpful. I had a beer and a craft of wine with a cheese board and it was all wonderful. When ever I'm in Vegas I will come here. It's a nice break from all strip life a place for locals."}
{"text":"Went here after exploring the Donut Bar. Wow I was blown away by the teamwork I saw coming from Naomi and the master grilled cheese chef behind the bar. I forgot his name but the teamwork I saw from both of them was great! Its not everyday you see something like that from two people holding down the fort! 

Had an IPA and mushroom grilled cheese which was amazing! My mom came to join us after and had a signature fig drink with house infused drunken fig! :) That was great! Go see Naomi and eat great food! Definitely check this place out at the Container Park!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and lunch-tails Bins 7022 and had Grilled Flaming Cheeto sandwiches,  grilled Cabernet Mushroom sandwich, Token Sandwhich & Peach Sangria. DELICIOUS! THANK YOU Naomi for the Experience!"}
{"text":"We went here during the Halloween party with the 90s cover band. They had spiced cider with Jameson. OMG it was awesome! You need to try if you visit during the fall season. 

I was sad they ran out of the ingredients of one of their cocktails that I wanted to try which was disappointing. I feel that on holidays you should know you are going to be busy and plan accordingly but their cocktails we did try were good. 

The service was good and our bartender was very nice. I'd come back on a night I was looking for a low key night to enjoy a couple of drinks."}
{"text":"Got Cheese?!

My favorite friend girl and I stopped in to Bin 702 for a some gourmet sandwiches, wine and girl talk. Bin is another great addition to DTLV and a perfect fit in Container Park. The place is small but cozy and in 55 degree weather we didn't mind being up close and personal indoors. 

I started out with a glass of Pinot which is always a safe choice in my opinion. It was pretty delish as expected. 

We ordered: 12 Montaditos for $24 
*Flamingo Hot Cheeto was my first choice and I enjoyed every bite. Surprisingly I didn't taste the Cheetos but that's okay because the cheddar inside was amazing.
*The Lobster was another great choice and the bread was even better. 

We tried a few others but the sandwiches got cold pretty quickly and eventually everything started to taste the same. 

Cheese Board $26
 I'm no cheese master but I did enjoy the board. The fig jam and honey comb were my faves. 

$75 bucks later I'm full from bread.

I probably wouldn't return but I'd definitely recommend for the experience."}
{"text":"This is a super cozy little beer and wine shop built inside of an old shipping container.  We arrived on a Friday evening when there was live music in the adjacent courtyard, and were able to sit out on Bin 702's patio to take in the show.  We each enjoyed a beer (they don't have a lot of taps, but they were all good craft beers - including Hangar 24, one of our faves); and shared a small plate of their charcuterie and cheese.  The food was excellent, the service friendly, and the ambiance...on a warm fall night in Vegas...romantic and magical.  My only beef is their beer prices are a little high.  $7 for a pint?  Hmmmm."}
{"text":"Umm.....who's idea was it to charge $16 for a 6 ounce mimosa in a plastic cup. We will NEVER and I repeat NEVER be back and I will warn every single person that I can to beware."}
{"text":"The food is great the service sucks never met ruder people in my life, and they over charged paid $30.00 a salad and didn't want to deal with it!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! Went here for girls night to a cute little wood shack type establishment. The staff were so welcoming and had the pleasure to assist us!

We ordered the 12 mini sandwiches which were freaking awesome and a bargain! There were 4 of us to feed and we were pretty full. They have a hot Cheetos sub..... I want to try the full size of it for sure but it was incredible. My other favorites were the brie, and the mushroom subs! We also got the mini bin cheese and meat plate. A little expensive but so so delicious and worth it, next time I will definitely be buying the larger one.

Their beer and wine selection is definitely on par. Reasonable prices and amazing beers I've never even heard of. I think my favorite one was the good earth beer? I can't wait to come back to try the other food they have!"}
{"text":"I went to check out the container park and found this gem along the way. What an awesome little wine bar. Plus craft beer and craft cocktails. Taryn's b****face was excellent. I've never had fig infused vodka before. And then after that one of the amazing bartenders made a drink that she just made up and it was delicious! All the bartenders were amazing! I didn't get to try the food but it all looked amazing. Will definitely be coming back on my future vegas visits."}
{"text":"Hot Cheeto grilled cheese sandwich!!! Need I say more?   I was at the container park with kids so I couldn't hang out here but they advertise the sandwich on the window and the kids were all over it. Staff was super friendly, prices are reasonable for the location I think $8 each. And the sandwich, well I made them let me have a bite from each and I was pleasantly surprised. Both of my kids enjoyed it. They have a patio and a few seats inside, I definitely wanna come back without kids and try some other grilled sandwiches they have on the menu. They let me know they also do postmates..."}
{"text":"A kewl bar inside container park. I had a peach moscato that was good. I will definitly be back here and its a nice realsing area to have a drink with friends or a loved one ..."}
{"text":"What a great little spot. So cozy! We had the charcuterie with cheese very tasty. Very friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Bomb ass sandwiches!! Cabernet mushroom is my fav! Girls working here are super cool and polite and awesome and all the best about their service. Prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend for lunch and really enjoyed ourselves. I'm pregnant at the moment, so I'm jealous that I couldn't partake in any wine sampling, and for that reason didn't tease myself by even looking at that part of the menu. I would love to come back after baby to treat myself!

That being said they were more than patient and accommodating as well as knowledgeable about their food menu for my dietary restrictions. We both ordered paninis, and were sad when we were finished,  because they were really good. They served them with a few thick slices of pickles, which I loved (duh). They served my friends wine in the bottom of an old wine bottle that was re-purposed as a glass, which was a nice touch. 

I would definitely go back, cute, friendly, and good. Decor was nice too."}
{"text":"Amazing location! Ryan the chef was such a kind, descriptive, and fun person. The Bin plate was absolutely delicious. Worth every dollar spent, including drinks"}
{"text":"Came out on Friday night to enjoy David Park at Downtown Container Park and figured this spot might be okay to enjoy the music  out on the patio. This place was okay.. sorry i will be trying another spot.   

Service was good, the waitress was very attentive, but there was not a whole lot on the menu. the group shared a charcuterie platter and a turkey brie sandwich."}
{"text":"Amazing cus service!  Yumma wine.  A very talented chef.  You can tell a copious amount of love goes into his cheese trays!   JUST SAYING!"}
{"text":"Very nice cozy bar.. Perfect for GNO!!!
Service was amazing with Nikki. She described everything very well and held comfortable conversation. The place definitely encouraged conversation with soft music and comfy seating. Will be back!!"}
{"text":"If you are going to the container park, you owe it to yourself to stop by Bin 702! Plan to sit inside if you want to drink from a glass and not a plastic cup. They have several nice wines by the glass from $8-$15 range. We were able to get a brief break from the crowds on a Friday and find a nice spot to sit and be civilized, that didn't cost us an arm and a leg! We spoke with the chef for a bit even though we didn't order any food. Just really cool people and and a cool place to be."}
{"text":"We didn't try the food but the service we got was awesome. I went with my husband and some of his friends, and the bartender was so sweet and fun! The drinks we got were good and I really liked the atmosphere! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is so adorable. 

Right in the center of the container park, it's the perfect place to relax and grab a drink and a delicious little snack. 

Happy Hour is every day 3-6, with $5 beers, $6 spirits and $7 wines. This is the perfect time to come since the weather in Vegas is so nice right now and you can actually enjoy sitting outside.

We also ordered a cheese plate as well as 6 different mini sandwiches (montaditos) for $13.50.  The bread was so good. You can choose whatever 6 or 12 sandwiches you want. We ordered a lobster, the hot cheeto, a Brie and apple, mushroom, Gorgonzola, and a cuban. All delicious and perfect for sharing. 

The service was great and prices totally reasonable."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. I drag friends here whenever they visit Vegas for the first time and we get good drinks and the sandwich platter. The grilled cheese with flaming hot Cheeto spread is one of my favorites. I was also a big fan of a hot apple cider whiskey thing they had over the winter.  The bartenders have always been sassy but in a fun enlightening way that makes them enjoyable to chat with.  The seating is right next to the stage so you often have a good ambiance and whenever shows are going on a good seat."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing! The bartender was really nice, she gave great service all the way. My friend had the Ruben and I have the flaming hot Cheeto turkey sandwich. Both really really good. So glad we stopped in. Will definitely be back! Clean and cute love it"}
{"text":"Super cute wine bar inside container park. Had a small bin (mini cheese board) and a few drinks while sitting outside on a couch under a heater people watching. Great service and super trendy fun place to spend an hour."}
{"text":"Omg second time at the place, my friends and I had a blast hanging out here for cinco de mayo. They had great margaritas and lobster quesadilla which were crisp and so fresh. Shout out to the crew here they are the best"}
{"text":"Bin 702 is a small restaurant located in the Container Park is Downtown Vegas. 

I decided this is where I wanted to eat for my birthday for lunch before heading over to Oak and Ivy.

There isn't a lot to be said. The menu is fairly basic and the focus is on premium grilled cheese sandwiches. There are a few other options like salad and cheese and meat boards.

I did a salad, a mini Cuban, and a mini Flamin Hot Cheetos sandwich. Also got a beer. The food was pretty good and our bartender was awesome! She was really nice and seemed fully engaged with every person who comes in."}
{"text":"Specialty Grilled Cheese and wine on tap. Who doesn't love a wine and cheese party. Beer selection limited, but they are quality beers.
We did the 6 small sandwiches. The Brie/Apple and Lobster were the best in my opinion. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Brie grilled cheese sandwich is reallllllllly good!!! They have small food menu but their sandwiches are good!! Lots of beer and wine on tap also so if you just want to drinks, it's a good place to chill. The park next to this place have lots of live music event so pretty deal for a tiny bitty bar/restaurant"}
{"text":"Really? You all love this place THAT much?? Why? Because you want to pretend you're classy and such seasoned 'wine connoisseurs' while you watch 85 strollers walk by? As you eat your overpriced, shitty sandwich inside the steel walls of a glorified outdoor mall, remember that this is where you are: in a glorified, outdoor strip mall on land that used to be pissed and shit on by all the meth addicts who are currently not even allowed inside the premises. Oh, okay. Makes sense then.

This is not a place for locals. Locals cannot afford to spend $14 on a SANDWICH that doesn't come with anything. Come on. I know you're anticipating this place becoming 'hip and happening' but it's not there yet! I guess with prices like these, though, they are striving for only one kind of clientele. 

I ordered and paid $8 for a grilled cheese. Bread, and cheese, heated in probably a toaster over. Hello, I just moved from NEW YORK CITY, and if I were to get a sandwich for $8, I CAN ASSURE YOU, it would be more than just two pieces of bread and some cheese. 

Actually, at the 24-hour deli down the block from my last apartment, here is what I got for $7: sopressata (and a retarded amount of it), provolone, lettuce, tomato, mayo, onions, pickles, salt, pepper, oregano, and TOASTED on a HERO ROLL they made there, FRESH, BY THEIR OWN HANDS. any time of day. for $7!! and it's always so damn big that I save half for later cuz - seriously - it's that damn big. This is pretty much a standard anywhere in Brooklyn. I will take a picture next time and edit this post with it.

One would think, at BIN 702, they'd at least put a tomato on it, or some lettuce, or some SPICES??? Or SOMETHING to give it some flavor. Carmelized onions? Hell, I'd even take some raw red onions. Or chopped up raw garlic. Just do something to pizzazz it for THAT price. That would probably cause it to be an extra $5 for those ingredients. I am still in disbelief I paid for this, if you couldn't tell. And this happened a few weeks ago.

(For reference - this is what I can expect for **$7** - IN MANHATTAN, in the LOWER EAST SIDE, one of NYC's most expensive neighborhoods, at a grilled cheese-specific restaurant called, \"Little Muenster.\"

THE WORLD'S BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICH
Crispy Pork Belly/Soft Omelette/Gruyere/Gouda/Kewpie/Amy's Roll. 

AND BREAD FROM AMY'S. I rest my case.)

If you don't believe me, here is an example: http://littlemuenster.com/menu/

Las Vegas - you will never be NYC. Or San Francisco. Not even Chicago, no matter how hard you try. So please, stop trying with your \"artisanal wine tastings\" and just be your damn self. 

And, if you *DO* want to be like NYC or SF or, hell, even Chicago, start modeling yourself after their politics when it comes to catering to locals."}
{"text":"Another Container Park hit for me. This little bar, located on the first floor across from the toy store, has tons of great beer selections and small plates. The bartender was awesome in recommending some delicious local beers. Alongside our beers, I had to try a grilled cheese sandwich on the menu that was staring me in the face. It was a turkey, white cheddar and avocado with Hot Cheeto spread grilled cheese. Whoever created this sinful grilled cheese needs to be hailed a god. Overall, if you are seeking great drinks and an amazing grilled cheese then definitely check this spot out."}
{"text":"A fantastic little find in Downtown Las Vegas. We were on a whirlwind tour of downtown which had our group of 10 on a hop of bars, restaurants, casinos and museums on Saturday afternoon/night. We started at Atomic Liquors for drinks, proceeded to Bin 702 in the Container Park, then the El Cortez, and culminating with a nighttime tour of the Las Vegas Neon Museum boneyard. So, Bin 702. A local--a waiter in one of our breakfast joints--recommended we try something in the Downtown Container Park. Everybody in our group was willing to try something different, and Bin 702 was not a conventional restaurant. I contacted them to see if they could accommodate our large-ish party, and Taryn quickly returned my email request to say they could accommodate us. Bin 702 is located in two connected shipping containers. The menu consists of small plates options, charcuteries and cheese boards, and montaditos (mini sandwiches). We had a fantastic variety of each as well as an excellent selection of craft beers and inventive cocktails. We started with two charcuterie boards which offered 4 meats, and two cheese boards, offering 4 cheeses. The menu described these boards as such: \"Artisan cheese and curated meat beautifully presented. All served with fig jam, honeycomb, whole grain mustard, olives, almonds and dried cherries.\" Forgive me for not remembering the specific meats and cheeses on these boards, suffice it to say EVERYTHING was delectable, especially when paired with the fig jam and mustard! Next we split three montaditos samplers which included the following: Flamin' Hot Cheeto - house spread, white cheddar; Bresaola - St. André, Brie - Apple, almond, honey; Turkey - Fig jam, smoked gouda; Sopressata - whole grain mustard; and Lobster. The Turkey and Brie were so good we ordered another serving of 6 sandwiches of just those two options. Everything was prepared with care and wonderfully presented. Speaking of my drink option, I had the local craft brew, Big Dog Las Vegas Lager, which paired really well with all of the food I ate. As if the food and drink were not enough, our server, Naomi was FANTASTIC, happily engaging with our group throughout the evening. I'd recommend Bin 702 based on the food alone, but I heartily recommend Bin 702 for its atmosphere as well. In all, a wonderful experience. I'd definitely return when I'm next in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, staff and lobster grilled cheese are all awesome. Do not miss this place when downtown Vegas"}
{"text":"They had happy hour until 6 on a Thursday, and other wines featured for $5 any time. The featured wines were a variety of red and white, very nice! Our group of 4 sat on the patio, and started out getting our drinks at the counter.  They had water and cups available right on the bar, extra points! After a while, we had a server for our table. The line at the bar kept getting longer, so this was welcome! 

I loved the charcuterie, it was a large portion and had a great variety to sample! The cheese was very good, and I'd recommend this to share with a few others. The lobster sandwich was OK, it really had too much other stuff that overpowers the lobster. There are quite a few other types of sandwiches to choose from as well. As the name Container Park implies, the restaurant is smallish. Although, there was more room inside than I had imagined. Getting drinks at the bar was fine, but I didn't have to wait in line, as my timing was perfect. If I had, I doubt that my experience would've been so positive!"}
{"text":"I was only person at the bar and it took 5 minutes to get waited on. Then they forgot to bring me the food. The servers seemed more intent on their joking around with each other than serving customers."}
{"text":"Tasty wine and cheese plate and good Pinot Grigio. Nice location in container park with beautiful lights and a good patio to chill and relax on."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at this place.  Bad attitude, the lobster sandwich was terrible and they overcharged me.    

I love lobster sandwiches, so I went to this place induced by some good reviews about their lobster sandwich.  Not only their lobster sandwich was terrible, but so was the attitude of one of the servers, a lady with one of the sides of her hair shaved.  Although the lobster portion was generous, the lobster was cold, totally tasteless, and bad quality bread. I had read the sandwich came with Greek salad.  The so called \"salad\" was just a few pieces of cheap lettuce, without dressing, without nothing.  They carry no Coke or Pepsi, in fact, when I ordered my soda, one of the servers told me that Coke was not good for me.  Since when does a server have to be critical of a customer's beverage preference?   Then they wanted to sell me a Cola, a brand I had never seen before.  I ended up having a glass of water.

On the menu the lobster sandwich was $12, but they charged me $15.  After I disputed the charge, the same lady that criticized my Coke drinking habit refunded me not without adding more inappropriate comments.  She needs to learn the basics of customer service and business etiquette working at a food place.  First and last visit."}
