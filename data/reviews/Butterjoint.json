{"text":"Love the Butterjoint! My new favorite place. We went last night and had the best time. Will was our server/bartender.  We were able to get a table in the back. Very chill atmosphere... Loved the jellyfish art hanging from the ceiling. We started with tallow fries and the pickle platter. I love pickled and fermented food. The platter had pickled turnips, green tomatoes, sauerkraut, spicy kimchi, and pickles.  Amazing!! Super yummy. The tallow fries were so tasty that we ended up ordering another order. There is a bar menu but you can also order from Legume's menu.  I ended up getting the scallops with the lentils! They were perfect. For dessert Will made us Spanish coffees that they light on fire... So toasty and delicious on a cold snowy night. I am so excited about the Butterjoint! I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and would definitely go again, but wasn't blown away by anything in particular.  The food menu is pretty limited, which is expected since it's a bar and there's a full restaurant next door.  We tried the perogies and some of the pate.  Both were good, but again, nothing astounding.  Although, now I see that we could have also ordered from the legume menu...  We had some cocktails and would definitely come back to try some of the others.  Overall, I'm mainly won over by the location, which is walking distance for me, and the fact that it wasn't too crowded at about 5:30pm."}
{"text":"As mentioned in all the reviews the food was fantastic - the Kielbasa really carries the day - but what really makes Butterjoint special are the Mixologist's - Joe and Justin their passion, expertise and customer service make the experience truly memorable."}
{"text":"It's nice to have this bar located on this side of Oakland.  That is to say a bar that's neither sketchy, nor overrun with college kids.  The small plates are solid.  I had the small plate of the night, which was meatballs, polenta, and escarole.  The meatballs were a little tough, but the dish was filling.  There's a decent drink selection, though the drinks a bit over-priced.  $4 for a Yuengling?    I had to give this place only 3 stars because the service was poor.  Our server seemed more interested in talking to his friends at the other table than taking our drink orders.  He wasn't rude, just disinterested.  My friend then waited 45 minutes for a hamburger after we had all been served our small plates.  The server apologized and the manager brought over the burger, but neither seemed genuinely sorry.  The restaurant was very warm, so warm everyone at the table was complaining of sweaty thighs.    I will give Butterjoint one more chance."}
{"text":"This was one our favorite places in Pittsburgh. The periogies were so good, we ordered seconds! They have a great cocktail culture that stems from having two amazing bartenders behind the bar. The vibe of the restaurant was a mix of younger trendy professionals and students. The food, drinks and vibe were amazing but what really stood out for me was the excellent service! I ordered a bourbon drink knowing I don't like bourbon (wanted to try something new) and they took it off my bill even though it was completely my fault and I was willing to pay for it. They also were kind enough to help us find our way home since we were visiting from Canada and didn't have access to internet. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Seems like from the reviews, this place is hit or miss.  For us, it was a partial miss with the food.  Service was excellent, and the pierogies were good.  Burgers ordered medium came out uncooked in the middle.  We try and avoid that happening by going with medium.  Server was gracious and offered to have them cooked longer, and we were comped a dessert to share."}
{"text":"In Pittsburgh for work, went for a cocktail and a couple of apps. Not fair to judge just based on my couple of apps, BUT. If you can't offer fried chicken livers and then make it delicious, something is wrong. Unseasoned, greasy, poor fry. Blue fish crostini were ok, but the toasted baguette slices with olive oil had no finesse. Cold, crumbly. Cocktail was bourbon, rum, aperol and bitters I think. Good, but a little unbalanced with too much orange and not enough bourbon kick. Atmosphere was nice, busy and warm. Too bad about the iffy cooking."}
{"text":"Great vibe, amazing service. Enjoyed their restaurant next door 'Legume' last night. Came back here because we liked it so much."}
{"text":"First night visiting Pitt and had to check this place out. Friendly, courteous servers as well as a great cozy environment and fantastic food makes for a great time.  Check them out!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What a wonderful time my wife and I had at The Butterjoint! We arrived around 6pm on a Friday and had a bit of a wait, but we were greeted promptly and taken care of by the server even though it was standing room only.   Our server Ben was excellent, very attentive even with a big happy hour/dinner crowd, and his compatriot manning the clipboard watched tables like a hawk to turn them over without rushing the folks enjoying their meal.   The food was wonderful. Butterjoint has one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh, made with grass fed and finished local beef. Every day they have a new Fancy Burger that arrives with \"Fancy\" burned into the bun. So good!  We will return and try to avoid happy hour. The place settled down around 7 when we were there."}
{"text":"I tried to give this place two chances but both times failed me. The wait for my burger was 45 minutes the first time. The second time was 65 minutes! Both times they apologized and offered free dessert, which came out before the burgers. Burgers are fine nothing special... drinks not unique. For the quality of burger they're serving it's certainly not worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were so excited to try this addition to Legume out. We arrived around 7pm, sat down, ordered drinks, and inquired about food/desserts. After our drinks arrived, our waiter told us he'd 'be right back.\"  He never did come back.   The man behind us ordered and received his meal, and the family behind him ordered theirs. We finished our drinks, found our waiter, told him we would not be ordering food, paid for our drinks, and left. We have not had such bad service anywhere else in Pittsburgh. Really disappointed.  Highlight of the night, we had a delicious dinner at Park Bruges."}
{"text":"Great service here, great cocktails and an interesting draft list. The bartenders and waitstaff have a great rapport with the locals and I like that you can order from both the bar menu and the Legume menu.  Only two things prevent this place from getting the full 5 stars: 1. Why \"butterjoint\" instead of the bar at Legume? Why the need to brand it as a new restaurant? 2. Very limited vegetarian options and virtually nonexistent vegan options. Tallow fries really don't taste that much better, and they're not worth the extra beef fat, in my opinion.  Still, a fantastic place. Gets crowded on the weekends and during happy hour so get there early!"}
{"text":"The fancy burger is consistently the best burger I've ever eaten. Really classy bar, I would put it in the \"speakeasy\" category."}
{"text":"Excellent food, atmosphere, and service.  We went on a non-profit fundraising night, which they hold the first Tuesday of every month, and was created by the staff.  The place was packed wall to wall. It was good to see people getting out to enjoy some great food and support their communities. The servers donated all of their cash tips to a designated non-profit in the area. Amizade was the non-profit selection last night. Amizade helps connect people throughout the world with community projects to enhance education, health, fair trade, and other services. Overall if you enjoy a fine craft beer selection with a menu infused with fresh options daily, then Butterjoint is a great spot to try."}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh, we decided to yelp it for a decent place to eat. Legume came up, but we were in the mood to relax and veg out, thus decided to eat at Butterjoint instead. The decadently red interior was warm and inviting. Our waitress was super nice and even brought us menus from Legume, so we could try the food in the comfort of our red palace. The cocktails were unique and delicious. We tried the pierogies and ended up ordering the \"special\" burgers, which were mouthwateringly delicious. Perfect experience in a perfect bar to wrap up our trip."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. If your gonna serve a burger then is should at least be good. Legume is a fail too. Skip the headache and go to Tessaros where they make a fantastic burger and care about customer service."}
{"text":"Cute and classy. Not many tables and a small bar. The cocktail list is pretty decent and they do know how to make a good drink, even if those drinks are a bit pricey. I had the pierogies and they were good, yet nothing to write home about. The menu has a lot of fried items on it but you can also order from the adjacent Legume. I do like how they accept reservations for a tables. I definitely want to try their happy hour next."}
{"text":"I went to the Butterjoint last night. The menu is very limited but is basically pierogies or a burger with different toppings. Since I am a vegetarian the only thing I could get on the menu was pierogies. They were very over priced and didn't taste homemade even though they were supposed to be. Drinks were also very overpriced and small. Apparently the burgers were good but there was no option for a veggie burger. I would not go back"}
{"text":"Butterjoint has great perogies and I mean the real authentic stuff.   The burgers are great also."}
{"text":"The bartenders and cocktails are awesome at this place. The prices are also as cheap as you get in Pittsburgh. Especially whiskey pours. Ate a pork/kielbasa/sauerkraut pierogi dish that was honestly one of the best meals I've had outside of my mom's house in pittsburgh. The place is tiny but a nice environment. I don't go here enough. Love this place."}
{"text":"We came here on our first visit to Pittsburgh. My husband and I both had burgers and both thought they were the best burgers we may have ever had. I had the fancy burger of the week which had pimento cheese and fried onions and even though it had all that fancy stuff on it, I could still taste the quality, juiciness and flavor of the meat. The service and drinks were great too. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome burgers!  The extra fancy burger with onion jam was really good.  Fantastic service and good drinks.  Very impressive."}
{"text":"Wow. Best burger and fries I have had in 20 years. Grass-fed. Tomato was incredible. Fries were addictive. Smoked rhubarb ketchup, too. Awesome. Cannot say enough good things. Just visiting. Good reason to come back to Pittsburgh! Not much seating - more of a gastropub -  but nice people and good music. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Go there.  Everything blew my mind. If you appreciate excellent tastes you'll appreciate this establishment, and this review."}
{"text":"The food and environment was good. It's worth checking out once if you live in the Pittsburgh area."}
{"text":"I like the simple menu, I grabbed a burger with blue cheese and caramelized onions. The best part is that they will cook the burger as rare as an aristocrat would want it. The Happy hour specials are pretty darn good and I liked the variety of draft beers, yeah yeah I know that I'm supposed to try the cocktails, well, maybe next time. I will certainly come back here for a burger in the near future, or maybe an appletini...HA!"}
{"text":"It really doesn't matter about the food or drinks. I froze my a$$ off the whole time. I'm so tired of having meals ruined by 50 degree restaurants.  Waitstaff need to realize that clientele like cozy in the winter - no the correct temperature for kitchen s taffeta to be able to wear short sleeves."}
{"text":"holy sweet buttered heaven! the food is brilliantly well thought out. it's approachable and sophisticated. beef tartare small plate is perfect. the plate was bordered with four different traditional companion condiments. each quadrant was delightful, the capers being my favorite. the burger was phenomenal. a perfectly composed delicate-yet-hearty bun cradled a fresh formed and well seasoned patty.  add a smear of mustard and some dank Gruyere and it's like heaven.  steak tartare was a hard act to follow but the burger and fries managed to do it. the non traditional pavlova was also unbeatable. I fell in love with baked meringue because of this dish. every bite of whipped cream, ginger custard, crispy meringue, and pear was dreamy. good cocktails, great service, pleasant ambiance, & the full menu from legume is available too (not like you'll need it). definitely try it!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten here once so far, but I was highly pleased with my experience.  The pierogies I ordered for an appetizer were probably the best I've ever had in all of Pittsburgh, and I've ordered them at quite a few restaurants.  The burger I had for my meal was also amazing and is definitely as good if not better than the famous burger chains in the area.  I would recommend coming early though so that you don't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Cocktails were delicious - if you like Mezcal try the Cross of Coronado!"}
{"text":"So happy with what Legume did to this spot.  It's a delightfully dark and intimate spot, perfect for a happy hour in Oakland away from the masses.  Actually it's an adorable date spot if you're both good with a little pretension for not a break the bank bill.  The cocktails are carefully crafted, and they offer a some really interesting ones. There's a good selection of drafts not to scoffed at thanks to their generous happy hour pricing. The small plates all looked pretty good, the swiss raclette with gherkins I got was awesome and exactly what I wanted.   I need to try a burger next time because the one that went by me looked like a perfect late night snack during their late night happy hour.  Glad this place exists."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER IN THE BURG!  Hi My Loves!  Myself and \"Porty McFreedom\" hit Legumes sister restaurant/bar and happened to kiss-kiss \"Hello! How are you darling?\" with Dollar Bill Flanagan...how can you meet and interview captains of industry on your KDKA show but dribble on your tie?! JESUS CHRIST MAN!  ANYWAY...As my core group of (3) fans know, I have a foodie love crush on Tate, a waiter, at Legume. So to honor him, I decided to try Butterjoint.   Genius move on my part. Tallow french fries! Yes please! ::pops some Lipitor and Metformin:: The \"build your own gourmet burger\" is for real. Very unique and delicious options that aren't just the standard junk. I selected caramelized onions, Gruyere cheese, brioche bun and delicious beef burger. Just perfect! Only downside is that I cannot eat this meal daily without turning into fat Dolly Parton.  Props to the bartender who worked with me and was kind enough to find a drink that worked for me when I made a misstep with my first choice ( I'm not a gin drinker).  I will go back...you should too!  Love you! Muah"}
{"text":"The Butterjoint is our favorite bar in the area. Not only do they have great cocktails and beer, but they have great dinner as well. The fancy burger and one bowl supper never disappoint, and if you want something more upscale you can order off the Legume menu. Chelsea is our favorite bartender/waitress, she always makes sure we have what we need, and even lets us change to our favorite table."}
{"text":"I would not recommend for groups larger than 2 or 3, it's tough to get a seat. Great food with only a couple options. It's either the Pierogi or Hamburger both are great. Diverse beer menu which I enjoyed as well."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and decadent desserts! I had the buttermilk panna cotta and my husband had the chocolate truffle cake and BOTH of them were sublime! The burgers are tender and cooked to perfection. My only complaint was how loud the music was on Saturday night. Otherwise, it's an intimate space for a late night bite with great food and service."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place and couldn't wait to try it out. Working in Oakland this is a perfect spot for happy hour. It is small inside but a cozy and trendy atmosphere.  We were lucky to grab seats at the bar and from 4:30-6:30 most of the drafts are only $4. They also have a specialty cocktail happy hour deal of the day and 2 wine specials.  I went with the Bell's Winter Ale and it was very tasty. I also ordered the goat cheese and pepper jelly crostini. They were amazing!!  Glad none of my friends wanted to try them because I didn't want to share. The spicy pepper jelly complimented the goat cheese well.  I do wish it was bigger inside and had more seating."}
{"text":"Hand down the best burger in Pgh. Yum. I crave it regularly."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent Butterjoint when we're in the mood for an AMAZING burger and a stiff drink. It never gets old, it never disappoints. If I'm feeling adventurous I may order off of the Legume menu, which is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Neat place but don't be fooled, this place is cramped! NEVER, I repeat NEVER ASSUME you can get a seat in here for more than 4 people. You can try and use Nowait but the app will only allow for a 4 person reservation. We got hosed on this on a Saturday night for 7. The site clearly states first come first serve or use Nowait but doesn't specify they can't accommodate a reservation for more than 4 on there.   Here on a Tuesday currently and I've been waiting for 45 minutes for only 3. Silly wait times but the drinks are crafted well. Will update on food.  Still waiting at 50 minutes. They took two groups before us that were checked in well after us.  So food was ok. Bland burger. Really nothing to write home about. I expected more from a place like this and a burger priced at $20. Basic beef burger with blue cheese, pickles and bacon. The burger was cooked rare like I like it but the outside didn't have a good sear so it was really mushy.  Want a good burger? Hit up SMOKE in Lawrenceville on Tuesday's!!!!! Nice sear on the outside and soft middle!"}
{"text":"This has been on my list to try ever since I visited Legume last year. Many friends have also said Butterjoint has their favorite burger. Finally got a chance to visit and it did not disappoint.   Butterjoint is mostly a bar with a few larger tables and a rather small food menu. I would say burgers and pierogis are the stars of the food menu (which I ordered both), although there are some small plates and desserts too. We got the hamburger with cheddar cheese and caramelized onions and the pierogis with kielbasa and sautéed greens. The burger was good, but the caramelized onions made it better and the fries were the bomb. Could've used more fries! The pierogis were perfectly cheesy and doughy, with the perfect level of crispness on the outside. Again, the caramelized onions made it better. Sautéed greens were just kale and they were a hair too salty for me, still tasty though. The kielbasa was a nice touch and you could taste the quality meat. I also ordered the pickle back shot (as recommended by a friend who regulars here). Now, I've never had a pickle back shot and neither do I know if most bars will serve it, but Butterjoint has it for $5. It's just a shot of whiskey and then a shot of pickle juice. If you like pickles (and whiskey, separately), the shot is delicious.   Overall, the food was pretty good and the service was excellent. The space is small, though. We lucked out and came across only two empty seats at the bar.   Quick note: I overheard one of the employees talking to some other patrons that they plan on opening another restaurant across the street? If this is true, I'm excited to see what else they come up with!"}
{"text":"Butterjoint is probably the closest non-pub bar to CMU before you hit the Shadyside bars.  The sister bar to Legume, the restaurant next door, it definitely has an aura of classiness with it's dark wood paneling.  They have all sorts of interesting cocktails and drinks.  One of their drinks even features a gummy shark if that's your thing.  The burger probably falls under one of my top 5 burgers in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Me: I understand that you have Legume's menu on the bar side. Server: Yes.  What do you want? Me: I don't know.  I haven't seen the menu yet. Server: We haven't printed it yet.  We print them daily.  HUH?  Am I the only one who had no idea what she was thinking of on her end of the conversation?  Why in the world would you ask someone what they wanted before they had a menu.  She was fully aware that I couldn't have seen a menu yet as she mentioned that they change daily and had yet to be printed.    The goat merguez that I settled on was delicious.  The pierogis were quite good but the potato filling could have been slightly smoother.  In fairness, they were competing against my grandmother.  The server was inattentive, cavalier, and as such, inhospitable.  Here's hoping this is a temporary job for her.  The hospitality industry is not where she can excel.    I met some very friendly and interesting conversationalists while in town for two days.  Fortunately, she was the exception to the rule.     To sum it up, I'd never go back."}
{"text":"My first one star review :( I've been here before and the food always is pretty good. For the price I would say it's not proportional. However the service makes it terrible. The table next to me even noticed and made a and had to wave down the server.   THE PEOPLE NEXT TO ME JUST SPILLED RED WINE. OH MY GOD. HOW RETARDED CAN PEOPLE BE HERE???? My white tennis shoes are permanently stained with RED WINE. UGH.... As I continue....   Anyways, the server with the long hair was quite rude with the way he responded when we were trying to get a plate. He said with a long and demeaning tone \"what do you want?\" Seriously?  Ugh, I told you I was splitting a dish, you could at least bring an extra plate if you aren't going to cut my burger in half like you usually do.   I an enthusiast for small restaurants that go the unbeaten path. However, I never had to write a bad review, congratulations for being my first."}
{"text":"Butterjoint is a nice option compared to the other bars in the area (Logan's, Luna, Chiefs). Other bars around here seem to cater to those who have lost something, their home, their teeth, their dignity... But anyways Butterjoint is clean, has a great selection of microbrews and cocktails, and they have happy hour specials and good food. Which would be a 5 star in my book, but this place is sooooo small that it gets cramped fast and you have no room to move."}
{"text":"Best burger I've ever eaten, hands down. I have dreams about these burgers! I can't even explain the way they melt in your mouth and how the bun never gets soggy. Butterjoint is the small bar area of Legume. It has a more casual, hipster vibe and is far less stuffy. The drinks are pretty good too. You can also order the whole menu from Legume if you want. Wish there was more seating or they took reservations but other than that, the burgers are just mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"This place is tiny so seating is difficult, to say the least. For that and the long wait, I deducted a star. That's where my disappointment ends. We were in town for a few days and I was craving a good burger something awful so what do I do? I pull up my trusty Yelp app. My hubby makes fun of me for my dependence on Yelp, but he was thanking me yesterday.   The menu is very small, mostly consisting of burgers and pierogi. I ordered the burger with Gruyere and caramelized onions and my hubby got the same. First, I tried the fries, which I had with the aioli. How awesome. They were flavorful and fresh and everything that tries should be. Impressed and hopeful, I moved on to the burger. Holy Burgervana, Batman! That burger was good! The patty was clearly freshly ground on-site, the meat-fat ratio was perfect! And the flavor...oh, the flavor! It was well-seasoned, but not overly so as to take away from the flavor of the beef itself.   While eating a good meal, I hum. When eating a really good meal, I tend to rock from side to side. I did both last night."}
{"text":"It took three times to actually be able to come here an eat.  We tried two other times and the it was a 45 minute wait each time.  They only have around 7 tables total and a lot of first come/first serve bar and window counter space.   We got in at 6:30 pm on a Monday night and they weren't too busy.   It could actually be twice the size and still fill every table.   I had the Extra Fancy burger of the day with bacon and fries.  It was excellent.  Once of the best burgers that I have had. However the fries were almost cold.  I told the waitress when she came back to check on us and she simply offered to let the kitchen know for future customers.  She offered nothing to make it right.  I was a little shocked.  I would have taken another order of hot fries. Especially since the burger was $17.   My friend got the tartare.  He said it was very good, but it was the first time he had had it, so he had nothing to compare it to.  I don't like tartare, so I didn't try it.    Overall, it was very good. I would definitely come back.  I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but the whole french fry thing kind of ticked me off. The waitress was very attentive and nice otherwise.  I guess they don't care if you don't like the quality of any of their food product.  They have so many people who will fill the seats, they don't care about how hot the fries are or if you care or not."}
{"text":"This place is like a fancy Oakland speakeasy- which is cool considering the other, cheap and dirty options in the neighborhood.  I think it would be a great place for a HH spot for professionals.  The only downside is that this place is small and gets packed quickly.  I'm not a huge fan of standing up around a bar before 9pm -don't ask- so this place lost a few cool points.  I'm glad I wasn't feeling hungry for this exact reason.  If anyone is interested, I did recognize a few Pitt faculty and staff members there.  Just a heads up if you're trying to avoid your professors and advisors :)  Otherwise, a seemingly great selection of libations.  They had Mad Elf (a hot commodity in my book)! I'm sure I'll be back-my friends love it."}
{"text":"This place gets very crowded at happy hour, so better plan accordingly. It is small and does get very loud. I had pierogies with sauerkraut and sausage, and a side of onion and tomato. Everything was good, however, my favorite dish must have been the pavlova dessert."}
{"text":"Used the no wait app, and even tho there was only one party ahead of us, still had to wait an hour on a Wednesday which kinda sucked. However, the food was awesome and probably worth it. Tried the perogies first and they were awesome. Ordered the fancy burger of the day - it had peppers and pesto aioli. It was a great burger, and be fries were good too. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Great place for cocktails and appetizers. Food and drinks are always delicious. It can be a little cramped, but it's a good place to get drinks while you are waiting for a table at Legume."}
{"text":"Chelsea was phenomenal. We came in for a birthday, had great service, custom cocktails made for everyone in our party, and Chelsea's knowledge of early 90's music was the cherry on top of the sundae. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre burger. Decent pierogis. Loud. Overpriced. I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, but it would be a nice place for a group or a date."}
{"text":"Very cozy place to get a drink after work and have conversation with a friend. The fries were amazing! Not many tables, probably not suitable for big groups. Like the decor. Will come back again."}
{"text":"We ordered two apps (small plates), both reasonable size for appetizers. I hate when they give you so much that you don't want your meal. The blue fish patte was good, my husband loved it (more his taste) and the fried pickles were good, lightly battered and tangy, as they should be.  We both ordered burgers for dinner. Hubby finished his with a smile, but noted it was not the best he had ever had. Mine was a little under done (ordered Medium well, was closer to medium), but tasty, very juicy. The big digs were the fries-- absolutely perfect, crispy, salty, a favorite-- and the kimchi. My husband gets kimchi wherever they have it and this was the best he had ever had, comparing it to the real deal from Korea. Very spicy, though, be prepared. He loves heat and it made him sweat. I ordered the house red wine, which was lovely. Ambiance was good, however the seats by the window were a little cold and the tables a little too small for comfort. Wait staff was kind and attentive. If I could give points, 4.2/5, would only add a bit more spice to the burger and aioli and cook the burger a bit longer."}
{"text":"Not too shabby!  Stopped here prior to a concert at Petersen Events Center for some pre-show fixin's.  While I'd never been to Legume, I had sampled their works of art multiple times at the Steel City Big Pours and other food/booze events around the city, so I figured their bar would be a great choice.  The wife and I showed up at the beginning of happy hour (4:30-630pm), and immediately ordered ourselves a few $4 craft brews (more or less half off!).  After mulling both Butterjoint and Legume's menus for a bit, we decided to get the Goat Cheese Crostini (with an awesome house made pepper jam), the Vermont Raclette with Pickles (more or less a slab of melted cheese in a skillet with more crostini), and the Bread Pudding (my personal weakness and it didn't disappoint).  Service was great, and I just heard that Legume/BJ are offering lunch, so I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is formerly Legume Bar, and my friends and I have been frequenting after it opened 3 years ago since we live in the building above.  We've seen them go thru countless rounds of bartenders, menus, and decor changes, and we all unanimously agree it is perfect the way it is right now.  This is the bar we all wanted to live above. It is one long bar right when you walk in, made of dark wood, and the liquor is beautiful.  We come down for the best burgers in Pittsburgh every week.  When I say best burger, I mean it.  The meat is fresh ground 80/20 lean and fat. At medium rare, this thing sings to the red meat gods. So tender and juicy, never frozen, on artisan perfect buns with enough strength to hold the contents.  This is better than tessaros, better than eleven (big lean patty). In a different league compared to burgatory, brgr. The only burger that rivals it is Father's Office in Santa Monica / Culver City.  Do yourself a favor and come here.  Bar staff is like family, IPAs of all types always. on tap. I will dearly miss Butterjoint when I leave this city."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I came with friends on a Friday night, and though we waited a while for a table, we knew we were asking for it when we decided to come at 6pm. We were seated at a little table in the corner, and while we were waiting, servers continually came around refilling our drinks. I especially appreciated this as I was drinking iced tea.  My friends enjoyed dirty martinis and glasses of Grenache. They looked delicious, and my friends said they really enjoyed the drinks. To start, we shared the risotto balls. Yum! They were dough-y and gooey, and really delicious. We heard that the burgers are absolutely amazing, so we came to Butterjoint in the mood for burgers. We weren't disappointed.   I had a burger with American cheese and caramelized onions, and because they grind their meat fresh every day, I went ahead and ordered my burger cooked medium. It was really flavorful and melted in my mouth. It had just the right amount of red/pink for my taste, and the onions added an additional layer of flavor. The fries were yummy as well. They are the small, crispy, real potato-y kind. I was a fan.  Because we were all stuffed at this point, we said no to dessert. I would love to come back again and try dessert, or stop over to Legume and enjoy that menu as well."}
{"text":"Just WOW!! Have never had anything bad here!! Great beers on tap and great food that is consistent every time!! We always start with the Pierogies with all of the \"bells and whistles\" (kielbasa, sautéed greens and kimchi) and then we have BURGERS!! Seriously one of the best burgers in the 'Burgh!! The hearty salads are also delicious and very filling. The atmosphere is cozy - you just feel \"at home\" here. We usually go on a Friday night around 6-6:30 to avoid a wait and we have never had an issue. If you get there and you do have to wait, just grab a drink and hang out - it is DEFINITELY worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"This place is dangerous and can be habit forming.  First, the bartenders tend to know just what they're doing, and they do it well.  It gives the distinct feeling that they do care for their craft and want to make you happy.  Then there's the food -- almost always worth ordering and locally sourced.  Sometimes a BIT on the salty side, but hey....time for more drinks.  The ambiance is great (although the temp gets a bit high typically) and cozy.    Parking available right across the street in the garage."}
{"text":"Wow! This place was amazing. Went here last night while visiting Pittsburgh and will most definitely be returning. From service to food to the vibe this place is fantastic.  My husband had the fancy burger which he said is one of the best burgers he has had which is incredibly high praise coming from a man who has eaten burgers throughout the land. I had the pierogies and they were better than  a lot of the ones I ate while in Poland. The real five star bump came from the fries which were the best I've ever had. Seriously magic. We started the night with a pickle back (shot with pickle juice chaser) and even that was delicious. Cannot recommend this place more."}
{"text":"Not customer centered in which they should make clear their policy of not splitting checks for parties of 5 or more. Also when the bartender messed up a $10 cocktail instead of replacing it they simply said \"just squeeze the limes in it to make it taste better.\"  Terrible service. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Got the burger, goat cheese and pesto crostini, vegetables, house wine. All of it was excellent, and had a really fun time."}
{"text":"We stopped here for drinks after an event. We had eaten at Legume last spring, but since we do not normally frequent Oakland we had not been back to try out the cocktail bar side. I'm so glad that we did!! It is a small space on the opposite side of Legume with a separate entrance. There are a few tables in the front and back and bar seating. It was pretty busy when we were there but we were able to get a high table at the front.   We ordered a few different cocktails from the somewhat limited menu. The Black Manhattan was delicious, even though it was on the rocks and I usually order my Manhattans straight up. I also tried my boyfriend's Sazerac, which was also very good. The bartenders here know what they are doing! Bar Marco is still my bar of choice, but this one is up there with the recent openings of great cocktail bars in the city. There is a small selection of snacks, appetizers, and burgers as well. The service was attentive without being pushy, and we were left to enjoy our drinks with ample time between orders.  The background music and general noise level never overpowered our conversation, so it is a great bar to enjoy a few drinks with friends. Also, the lack of televisions is wonderful and adds to the relaxed vibe as it encourages patrons to focus on each other and their delicious drinks. I will definitely come back the next time I am in Oakland!"}
{"text":"Great cocktails and the only place I am perfectly happy to pay $15 for a hamburger.   The interior has a nice vibe, the music typically good, and the service solid.  My only complaint is that due to size and layout, once it gets busy it feels crowded."}
{"text":"Everything about my experience at Butterjoint was fantastic. I came at 7 on a Thursday evening and the bar was completely filled with a true mix of people, mid 20's to mid 70's. After waiting a bit a friend and I were able to secure a seat at the bar. I think this may be my preferred place to sit because watching the bartenders mix up all of the creative cocktails is pretty entertaining.   My friend and I both had the burger which is made completely in house from high quality, local beef; they break down whole sides of beef to make their own master burger blend. I can say with complete conviction that the burger coming out of that kitchen is the best burger I've had anywhere in Pittsburgh. It was cooked edge to edge to a perfect medium rare (that's what the kitchen recommends), perfectly seasoned, and served on a white bun that holds up to the juiciness without being super bready.  Pair that with some shoestring fries cooked in tallow (rendered beef fat), a great beer, and you have a burger and fries meal that can't be beat.   I'm sure everything else on their limited menu is just as good as the burger and I can't wait to come back and try it all."}
{"text":"I had a really amazing meal here and excellent attentive service.  There's an especially cute booth in Butterjoint that is oh so cozy, but there are other great places to sit as well.  The food is mostly comfort food and it is cooked to perfection.  Our waiter gave us lots of help in suggesting things to order, and he bent over backwards in making a drink for us that was not on the menu.  This place is a winner!"}
{"text":"For that little bit of Portlandia in Pittsburgh.  Hipster bartenders with tats who have facial hair and can make a mean cocktail.  The small plates do put the small in plates, and everything is medium good but nothing was OMFG good.   Great date spot.  They offer sautéed pierogies as well as deep fried, just in case you hate pierogies and want to see their flavor killed to avenge some childhood slight by a pierogi bully."}
{"text":"The wife and I had a good time at BJ. The vibe of the place is dim and intimate... the kind of place to take a hot date to  the food was lit the burger was quite good, but the tempura blossoms really stole the show  the service was exceptional, never did we want for anything. Recommended!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan! I'm not sure what took me so long to get there, but it was a perfect little place for happy hour drinks. It's small and cozy, so luckily we got there before the majority of people and had a great spot at the bar.   Happy hour specials included $4 drafts (which was what I had) and specials on wine and one liquor drink. Bonus points for the fact that they had several local brews on tap! I enjoyed a Grist House summer saison. The bartender was very friendly and gave great service.  I've also heard they do a beautiful job with their happy hour fundraisers - awesome to see them supporting great local nonprofit agencies!  Hopefully I can visit again soon to get food or apps and then bump this up to a 5-star!"}
{"text":"I loved this bar. The cocktails on the menu were fantastic (I had a strawberry cobbler and my friend had a peated martini...both delicious) but what really stood out were the drinks the bartender improvised based on my suggestions. I mentioned I wanted something with gin or silver tequila, not too bitter or sweet, and very clean-tasting and he came up with a cocktail that was both beautiful to look at and tasted even better. I had never had a drink with chartreuse before and he was dead-on with the suggestion/made sure I liked the taste & smell before mixing the drink. The decor is nice and dark and the food I saw looked spectacular (although I'll have to go back to heat). It's a bit expensive for me to be a regular drinking spot but, if you want a quality cocktail, this place delivers.  Update: I visited on a second occasion and tried the desserts which may give the drinks a run for their money. I'm not sure whether I loved my peach pound cake or Astoria cocktail more, although I want to give my bartender, Will, kudos again (had him both times) for another awesome suggestion."}
{"text":"Arrived around 4:30 pm and was able to get a table for 3. We all ordered the pirogies with sausage side. Oh my, just like our Mom used to make! Sour cream and onions included which was wonderful. The waitstaff was very pleasant and we will definitely be returning to enjoy more of the menu."}
{"text":"I have been to Butterjoint twice now and both times were above average. I visited last evening to catch up with a friend and grab burgers and they were cooked to perfection. We both got the same thing: burger with caramelized onions, bacon and cheese. I indulged in an Italian Greyhound cocktail - light and refreshing. You cannot go wrong with this place for a casual, yet trendy atmosphere with high quality food and drinks."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Decent selection of wine and cocktails. The aioli was magnificent, very smooth and garlicky. The burgers were cooked perfectly to order and delicious. I had the \"fancy\" burger with crispy onions and butter and onion jam that was unbelievable. Wonderful dining experience, can't wait to come back and try more stuff like the perogies with Kim chi."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burger I've ever had in the burgh! (Hubby said longhorn has better burger but I'm skeptical) Even the bread was flavorful with the juice from the meat. They sell out like crazy and we were lucky to get the last piece. I've read positive reviews so the expectation's already there but when I tasted it. I knew all the raving about that burger is true. Other items on the menu were ok but next time I would just get the burger and skip those."}
{"text":"Do you know why I like coming back to Pittsburgh? It's because the finest bars aren't too fancy to put pierogies on a menu with artisinal cocktails, and the finest bar patrons aren't too preoccupied with with propriety to pair a Sazerac with sauerkraut. Even if there's going to be an inevitable, peculiar aftertaste about an hour later.  I stopped in yesterday for happy hour, to drink, eat, and read last week's New Yorker. Nobody commented on the me reading the magazine or the other guy across the bar reading his book. This puts Butterjoint in the sweet spot of Pittsburgh bars for me, a place where I casually can do my thing and nobody raises a ruckus. It's not too refined that it's uncooth to read at the bar, not to divey that a guy sitting next to me would derisively inquire \"what're you reading, smartypants?\"   When I arrived at 6pm, the bar was filled but for one seat. I took that one. By 7pm, things had cleared out as happy hour ended. You may want to consider your time of arrival if you are coming with a small group. It seemed like a number of people sat at the bar while waiting for their table next door at Legume.  The burger here is magnificent. It's compact, but dense and weighty, filling but not bloating. You could try the daily Fancy Burger, but know the essential is a strong offering. The default burger even without cheese is a flavorful, ideally sized sandwich for accompanying a drink or two.   Order it medium rare, I say. The shape and density of the patty means temperature more easily controlled and done-ness more even throughout, meaning you get a better low-temp burger experience here than you might elsewhere around town."}
{"text":"Awesome spot! They have a service industry brunch on Mondays from 11:30 to 2. $10 for those in the industry and $15 for those who aren't. The vibe is great and the service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Younger crowd mixed with some older people. Happy hour specials are good. Didn't really like the Pierogies that much. Staff is pretty nice. Noise volume of bar is above average, but still comfortable."}
{"text":"I saw on the review on \"next\" where they thought the burgers are the best in the city... They are correct. I've had tassaros, brgr, burgatory.. They are all good, but butter joint is the best. The bar is cool stocked with local spirits, wigle whiskey, Maggie's rum, and others. The drinks are original and well made Drafts are local brew and the wine list is excellent. Plus, legume is connected so, there's that too! Great staff, very cool, very friendly, if they don't know the drink, they will find it!"}
{"text":"The best burger in the Burgh, some say. I ordered the \"Fancy Burger\" Pittsburgh rare and it was superbly prepared. I'm not one to lightly order a rare burger- but the quality of the beef at Butterjoint is second to none in the city. Cave aged Gruyere, onion jam, and an awesome bun all helped, but the beef was never secondary.  Tessaro's is a better bet if you have a large party looking for burgers."}
{"text":"On her recent visit to your restaurant my friend was treated rudely. I expect courteous service for all customers, even the ones that don't look like you."}
{"text":"I was really exited to try the place at first and plan to go back again because i have to believe what I experienced was unusual. The thing that really drew me to this place was the tallow appetizers. However when I went they were not serving that. It was a Friday happy hour and the whole reason I went was taken off of the menu. However I understand that sometimes ingredients run out and whatever excuse they may have had for its absence I will accept. Furthermore decent happy hour drink specials helped alleviate the problem. What i could not accept is that I had the single worst service of my life. This is sort of a hipster joint and I have never met a man that had more apathy to his job quality. I was at a table with five people and we saw so little of him it was comical. As this was a small bar and really not busy it was inexcusable.  After waiting for 20 minutes we finally asked him if would could order food at which point he said yes and then simply walked away for another 15 minutes before taking our order. The only thing worse than this mans service was his ridiculous mutton chops. I really hope this is not a typical experience at this place as decent food and drink specials could make this a very nice bar if the service was even remotely respectful."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for any day or any night. There is a great atmosphere with excellent music and friendly faces. While the food menu is light, everything on there is great. I recommend this spot to locals and travelers a like!"}
{"text":"This place is really small and there is not a lot of room to move around if it's crowded. I personally felt claustrophobic.  Cocktails were creative and they stock a lot of local spirits. Beer list was solid.   3 stars are for the uncomfortable setup of the place. I'm sure I would have given it a higher rating had I been there on a less crowded night."}
{"text":"What's happened to Legume and the butterjoint? They've both lost their luster. Our server tonight had no personality as did the servers who brought our food. I'm not quite sure why on the weekends, they have no valet parking. I'm so disappointed!"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS ARE NOT ENOUGH!  i love the chill atmosphere and stiff drinks!  will def be back!"}
{"text":"Nicest servers ever!   I visited Butterjoint for a cocktail with my friends before we went to Legume for dinner.  Ummmm...where are my friends?!?  The weather delayed everyone's arrival so I was alone for the happy hour before dinner.  I had been wanting to try drinks here for a while so I went in solo.  The wait staff greeted me, found me a solo spot at the bar, and even chatted with me for a few minutes.   I was really impressed with how friendly everyone was toward me.   I ordered a great glass of wine.  They have the same drink list as Legume.  The beers on tap looked amazing.  I was impressed with the unique assortment.  The food looked and smelled amazing and I will be going back to try it.   It is a smaller space so plan to go early if you want to sit to eat or plan on a small wait. Also, I would say plan to go with a small group, 5 at most."}
{"text":"Cool, chill and classy. Butterjoint is the kind of \"high-end\" like casual place I love to get a glass of wine and catch up with my girls over yummy pate and chicken livers. Yeah, my girlfriends are rad like that."}
{"text":"I'm embarrassed to admit that despite living pretty close to here, I had not yet been here (and we eat out... A lot!).  We didn't have plans one night so figured we would go check out Butterjoint and see what it's all about.  Well, it's all about the yummy in my opinion!   Upon entering, we were told seating was first come, first served so we grabbed a two top by the windows.  Within seconds, we were greeted by a friendly server who took our drink order... And came back with drinks quickly.  I was on fence as to what I wanted to order and he informed us that we could also order from the Legume menu. I wanted to see it, and he got us one super quickly.  My husband ordered from the Butterjoint menu - the corn fritter soup and the fancy burger... Both were fabulous. I love the tallow fries that come with the burger. Yum!  I ordered the mixed greens salad and beef tenderloin.  It was perfectly medium like I wanted and it melted in my mouth, like butter.  So good. I have to have it again.  For dessert, we had the inauthentic pavlova (I think that was the name)... Authentic or inauthentic, it was amazing.   The service was awesome, the food was fabulous, and the environment was chill. I highly recommend it... You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Best burger in the city hands down. I don't eat a lot of meat, so when I do, I like to make sure it is high quality and not something cheap like some of the other places around.  They also had a great beer selection and cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"A great bar! I love the happy hour. You have to get there super early, because it gets packed. Show up right at 4 and you can even snag the nice booths at the back. If it weren't for the fact that the staff clearly struggles to deal with the crowd, this place would get 5 stars.  The beer selections are good, and I always enjoy the house wine. Like Legume, there are not a ton of veg options for snacks (why must they be tallow fries??) but the pierogies are good, and sometimes they have arancini which are delicious."}
{"text":"Easily the best burger in Pittsburgh. Drinks are great and the vibe is very chill. Anything you order here will be delicious."}
{"text":"I came here last night during happy hour (which apparently encompasses Wed. after 10pm, who knew?) for a drink.  My drinking companion and I were able to get seated without a problem, which is nice because it usually seems to be packed.  We didn't order any food, since he just came from dinner elsewhere, and I'd had dinner earlier.  I ordered the house white blend, and it was \"citrusy and refreshing,\" as our waiter put it.  My drinking companion ordered a cocktail with tequila, fortified wine, and orange bitters, which I took a sip of, and it was quite refreshing, as well.  Service was excellent, as I've come to expect in establishments such as Legume, and our server was great at explaining the various drinks and suggesting them based on our tastes.  The atmosphere was laid back and classy, and quiet enough to actually converse with my drinking companion--much better than the average Oakland bar.  The only downside is that the drinks are a bit pricy, but the happy hour discount helps, and hey, you're paying for quality.  To be honest, I don't feel that I can fairly rate this place until I order some of the cocktails or food, hence why I'm going with my default \"I liked it\" 4-star rating.  I'm sure I'll be back, though, given how close I live!"}
{"text":"I still haven't eaten at Legume, but for my friend's birthday we wanted some cocktails and bar food so we thought it would be the perfect opportunity to try Butterjoint.  The ambiance is really nice. Laid back but refined, not quiet but not loud. Our server was genuine and hilarious, plus he had great recommendations. The cocktail menu is mostly classic cocktails, but I ended up going with a concoction of rum, applejack, and spices that was wintery deliciousness. My friend said all of the (many) classic cocktails he got were perfect.  For food we had the daikon fries, salad du jour, pickle platter, and burgers. Everything was really good, but the standout was the AMAZING pickles! The burger was cooked rare as requested and the meat was definitely top notch, but it was a little too salty for me, and I wasn't a huge fan of the accompanying fries with a pretty bland aioli. One of my friends did the one-plate supper of the night, which was stroganoff with meatballs--and the meatballs were seriously to die for. Who says that about meatballs?  Butterjoint made me want to kick myself for not getting to Legume sooner, so I'll definitely have to sample the full menu next time!"}
{"text":"I will admit that I was compelled to come here to try the burger, and I will say that it is pretty good. I haven't had many gourmet burgers in Pittsburgh, so I won't go as far as to say it's the best burger around, but it's definitely one that I would eat again. We tried both the fancy and the regular burger, but I would say that the fancy one is not necessary--just get an old-fashioned, classic meat patty burger with lettuce and onion, and cheese if you want. The bread is grilled just enough, and the patty is deliciously juicy (along with the cheese on top). In addition, the thin fries go super well with the burger. Definitely worthwhile."}
{"text":"Although I live a few blocks away from this place, I wonder how I have always managed to miss this gem! We headed here last night, after watching a show downtown for drinks and dessert!  I absolutely loved it. The service was excellent, the atmosphere was that of an upscale bar and for a Friday night, we were able to find seating pretty quickly. I had the Imperial Daiquiri which had a fine blend of Two Indies rum , cherry and lime. We also got the bread pudding for dessert, which was absolutely delicious!!! Baked to perfection with candied citrus and accompanied by ice cream with caramel, this was incredible. Reminded me, that I should head back to an amazing Legume dinner soon! Overall, totally coming back here as soon as I can find the next chance!"}
{"text":"Hip restaurant / bar attached to Legume.  You can order for the Butterjoint menu or the Legume menu.  I do appreciate the options.  Butterjoint really shines at happy hour.  The drink specials are pretty great and the service is top notch.  For starters, we had the fries.  Nothing special here but they went well with my IPA.  The goat cheese and pepper jelly crustini made for a nice flavor / texture combination.  I washed this down with the beer.  For dinner, I elected to order off the Legume menu.  I had the Artic Char which I ordered medium rare.  It arrived as I like it.  The veggies that came with it were also fresh and grand.  Great Fish on a cold Pittsburgh day.  I also sampled the sweet potato ravioli.  These were quite enjoyable as well.  Nice texture.  Good sauce."}
{"text":"Great food and a short but excellent list of beers, wine, and cocktails. Since it's connected to a nice restaurant (Legume), it has a little bit more of an upscale feel, but it's still relaxed (and it's always pretty loud). Get there early if you want a seat during the weekend or other popular times- it's small and fills up fast. This time, I got the hearty salad, which was great (though a little small for $14) and the fries. They change their menu up pretty regularly but I've been back a bunch of times and everything I've gotten has been great!"}
{"text":"Butterjoint added a tempeh burger since I last reviewed them - and it's pretty excellent too. Glad to see that they added a veggie option.  I wouldn't recommend coming here with any group larger than 4 people. It is simply a small bar with only one table that seats 4+. Accept that fact and plan accordingly."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burgers I've ever had was consumed here.   Although neighborhood felt a little dead when we came here late on a Thursday night, we were pleasantly happy to be embraced by the ambiance and a kitchen that was open late.   Everything on the menu looked delicious, but everyone told me that I could not go wrong with the burgers here, so I obliged and did not regret it one bit! The burgers are juicy, flavorful with a nice bun to meat ratio. I know that sounds a little particular, but I know you know what I'm talking about.  And how about those pirogies?  Excellent as well. I was surprised by the generous portions and just how filling it was, complimented by the kielbasa. Just about everything you could ever want from a late night, quality bite!   Also, they had great deals on house wines. How can you really go wrong?  The answer: You can't."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I was in Pittsburgh for a few months for work.  And this was my fav hang out.  You can get Legume's food at the bar!  So that was great.  Delicious food and great drinks.  Really nice bartenders!"}
{"text":"Great burger, great fries. I would go more often if they took reservations (but that wouldnt fit the casual atmosphere)."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great waitress - best burger I've had in awhile.   Get there early because this place is tiny and fills up pretty fast around dinner."}
{"text":"Everything we ate, drank was excellent. Extra special burger, fries, desert, drinks. All good. Service great."}
{"text":"I'd read some good reviews of this place on Yelp, so my date and I stopped by for a bite after work.   Our server was quite nice. He answered our questions politely, and I swear, if he wasn't so nice about everything I wouldn't have bought a $10 pink lemonade cocktail. Sigh.  I would say that our food was okay, but it didn't really meet my expectations. We shared some pierogis with sauerkraut, which were tasty enough, but just barely whet our appetite. My fancy burger involved sausage and sauerkraut, and it was decent. My date made his own burger, and he mentioned that the meat was not as hot temperature-wise as he wanted. At the end, we had a delicious panna cotta dessert with raspberry sauce and a shortbread cookie.   As my date brought up, I think the reason we were underwhelmed is because it's hard to compare our burgers here to ones we thought were equally good at Stack'd or Purgatory for a fraction of the price (especially Stack'd $3 burger deal)."}
{"text":"There is nothing really memorable here.   Had the peach tart - literally the worst dessert in my whole life. The pastry/tasting chef(s) should be fired immediately! It was awful, not sweet, or decadent. Bland boring ice cream. This thing should be written off ASAP!  The menu isn't very extensive. They have a happy hour - bar area only. However, its tiny and we couldn't find a seat.   I had a $14 cheeseburger. It was alright but no BD. Fries were pretty bad and they wouldn't let me substitute for onion rings."}
{"text":"Holy finesse! This place knows what's up! From their well-concocted cocktails and knowledgable staff to their fantastically innovational and delicious food, this place is sure to impress!  All that said, I'm a fairly broke person most of the time, and while I loved everything I tried (a gin cocktail, a laphroaig cocktail, a beer, beef tartar, duck), I won't be able to frequent the place because of the prices. They use the finest ingredients, prepare it in the finest and freshest of ways, and yes, of course, you pay for it. I expect and respect this, and still can't afford it.  I'll at least go by to sit with their super cool, super connoisseur staff!"}
{"text":"14 dollars for a burger was steep but this was definitely worth it. Best burger I've had in Pittsburgh. The ambiance is more upscale than most things in the area so it's a nice date night spot with great food. Drinks are expensive so load up before you get there, haha."}
{"text":"If I could give it 10 stars I would..  The best burger in the city no contest and perfectly mixed cocktails.  Their steak tar-tar is also top notch"}
{"text":"Butterjoint wasn't on the top of the list of my places to check out in Pittsburgh, but it was Monday and a lot of places weren't open. That ended up being ok, because our experience there was pretty good.   When we arrived there was a wait, but they have a tasteful beer selection and it was still happy hour. Eric was our server; he was very professional and friendly. No issues with the service at all!   For an appetizer we ordered the pickled radishes. We wanted something that wouldn't fill us up too much before dinner. This was a very simple appetizer with some amazing, bold flavors. The radishes were lacto-fermented and served with a perfectly contrasting creamy chili mayo.   We ordered the pierogies which were served with caramelized onions, sauerkraut (our choice), and sour cream. A good chunk of the menu is taken up by pierogi options which was surprising to me at the time, but then I finally put it together given the strong Polish roots in Pittsburgh. These pierogies had a nice chew to them and all the components worked nicely together. Would I order it again though? No. I was curious to see if there was something I was missing out on. Don't get me wrong, who wouldn't like potato and cheese stuffed dough? I just have a feeling there were stronger, more interesting menu items that should have been had.   The other item we ordered was the hamburger with Goot Essa cheddar. This was prepared well-- and you can tell that it is ground in house. Really good flavor.   I'm giving Butterjoint 4/5 stars, but I have a feeling if I chose more adventurous menu items it could have easily been 5 stars. As far as food that I had on my recent trip in Pittsburgh, it definitely was at the top and if in town again I would definitely go back. Little side notes: atmosphere was hip and who ever was playing the music was playing some excellent tunes."}
{"text":"My friend and fellow Yelper Carly K and I are always looking for fun places to grab appetizers and drinks and selected Butterjoint as our destination this week! I was a little confused as I walked into the restaurant when no one greeted me and was taken aback when another party barged in ahead of me, taking a table. Thankfully, there was still one table left after they were seated, so in my confusion of how seating worked (well, I'm still confused actually), my friend and I didn't get stuck fighting for seats at the bar.  As we arrived toward the end of happy hour, we started with a carafe of the house white. I was delightfully surprised by the wine. My reaction to most white wines is *meh* but this Portuguese white was absolutely delicious. I was excited when the carafe also gave us each two full glasses. We shared the tallow fries, which were flavorful and crispy, and then I tried the pierogies with sauerkraut on the side. Though the sauerkraut seemed a bit tough (undercooked?), the pierogies were perfectly warm, golden, and fried.  Even though we went to Butterjoint on the Monday night of Christmas week, the bar area was absolutely packed by 7pm, and the restaurant felt a bit claustrophobic due to the warm temperature. Though I really enjoyed the food, I wouldn't have enjoyed staying in the hectic environment much longer!"}
{"text":"I really can't speak highly enough of this place, and to know it's in North Oakland is even greater! The ambiance here is remarkable; trendy yet laid back. It's classy without being snotty. The best part, I can bring my fiancée here just to grab a night cap. It's a little more expensive than the Oakland dives yes, but  I guarantee that you will not find a better Manhattan in Oakland. And the happy hours..... You've gotta check them out!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at Butterjoint. The first time I stopped in was several months ago around 10 on a Friday night. This time around it was a Thursday night at 5:30. Butterjoint is located in one of the last  areas you'd probably think of if you were rattling off a list of areas/neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, North Oakland.  I can remember the first time going here and thinking it was a bit closer to the Carnegie Museums, but don't be fooled...it's a bit further away. I like this place because it has a warm and cozy feel. Their menu includes a wide array of specialty cocktails, beers, wines, and food. I honestly don't think the cocktails are pricey as they are right up there with bars of the same caliber (Acacia, Butcher in the Rye, and Livermore). A $12 cocktail used to be more of a once in a while kinda thing, but it's becoming more common lately, especially as newer, more unique places open in the city. On my most recent stop here, I managed to take advantage of a happy hour special (there were several). I can't recall the exact name/brand of the wine, but they were featuring a red and white for $5 a glass until 6:30. I arrived closer to 5:45 and sat at a high-top near the front window. The place was pretty packed with what I would assume were either early dinner guests or those also taking advantage of the specials, but by 6:30 the crowd has dispersed and openings were available at the bar."}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!!!  Great atmosphere, excellent food, delicious drinks, good beer on tap!  I ordered the Fancy Burger (made different each day) and it is currently the best burger I have ever had.  You have to try the burger!"}
{"text":"Nice little gem - superb burger, mediocre fries (a little too soggy and greasy) but a superb dessert (summer fruit crisp). Also, very attentive waiter!"}
{"text":"The burger was pretty good, really enjoyed the aioli!  I'd recommend coming here for drinks/snacks they have a wonderful happy hour.."}
{"text":"Had just the best dinner here last night.   Was a little crowded, so while we waited for a table we had a cocktail which was fantastic.  What made it even better is the waiter took our drink order while we waited, and then served us where we stood.  This was great for two reasons, first, the bar was crowded and it was tough to get any room, and the second was it was already on our bill when we sat down and didn't have to worry about closing any tabs.  Overall I thought the level of service was excellent considering it was crowded.    I had a burger, and in my mind it was the best burger in town.  I had it with the cave aged Gruyere and some lettuce and tomato.  Man it was so good.  My wife went with a couple small plates, the beef tartare and the pate, she raved over both of them.  However, I will never ever order anything but the burgers here.  It looked like they made their mayo in house, I didn't put it on my burger, but did dip my fries in it.  Was a little over garlic'ed for my taste, so beware there, I was happy I didn't put it on my burger.    Overall, great cocktails, amazing burger, great service.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A classy bar with some table seating. Went here last Thursday around 7:30 and had to wait for a bit to snag a table. Keep in mind all the seating is first come first serve. The wait was no big deal and we passed the time be having a few drinks.   After we found ourselves a table about thirty minutes later we ordered a wide array of the available bar food. Butterjoint sort of does twists on local cuisine favorites.  we ordered: Fried pickles, perogies and kielbasa, fried sauerkraut balls, pickled turnips, and the kimchi. Everything was superb, but the fried sauerkraut balls really stood out, a great spin on a Pittsburgh-style dish.  Drinks were sort of pricey, but well worth it. Food was a little more than the average bar fare prices, but again the quality was excellent. For two of us to eat and have a few drinks our tab ran somewhere around $70.  Great find. Will be back."}
{"text":"Amazing Food - local, fresh, delicious. Definitely try the burgers, pierogi, bluefish pate, and any dessert. You can also order from the Legume menu in the bar if the Legume kitchen is open. The people are amazing - service is totally down to earth and not uppity at all. It can sometimes be tricky to get a seat, since there are no reservations - just first come, first served - but it's so worth it! If you haven't been yet - GO NOW! They open at 4 pm so it's great for happy hours that transition into dinners. Will is an AMAZING bar manager, and will always make you something you enjoy even if it's not on the menu - although the menu options are always superb. If you haven't been back in awhile, get back there now!"}
{"text":"I went here with a friend for my birthday and was treated to some their fine concoctions. I was surprised that the prices weren't ridiculously high and while the size of the drink was rather small, it packed a punch.  We were out with our first drink. It wasn't hard to drink either, it was delicious and I'd never gone to another place that could whip up the kinds of drinks that they did that night. I am happy to say that I would come here again and again. This probably has the best ambiance that I've seen a bar have in all my life. The candles, the classically designed seating, and the nice wait staff were all part of making my night one of the best."}
{"text":"Butterjoint is Legume's bar area.  It's basically a bar and a handful of tables that are first come first serve, although when I've been there and it was super crowded, they did offer to take a name to wait for a table.  It's on the small side so on a Saturday evening by 6pm, it's really crowded and only gets worse.  This makes it a little awkward to get a seat/table.  However, the ambience (when not ridiculously crowded) is great.  More casual than Legume.  The food, as would be expected being part of Legume, is excellent.  It's a basic menu of a few snacks/appetizers, burgers and pierogies, although you can order from the Legume menu if you want.  I have had the frites, the raclette and the burger.  All three are amazing.  Hands down, probably the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh.  My overall feeling is that if you can go at a non peak time, it's a great pick.  If it's a super busy time, you may feel overwhelmed from the crowd but if you don't have to wait too long, it's worth it.  Again, it's still a bar so it's not meant to be quite a restaurant, but I enjoy going there when I want some great food and drinks in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Really great cocktails--too sweet, as is typical of American bars, but the bartender was great about tweaking them to our liking.  The atmosphere is very pleasant, and it's a great place to hang out before or after dinner at Legume next door.  It's a real neighborhood gem."}
{"text":"I love this spot. it's very loud but the food and drinks are amazing. I definitely have my favorite bartender - it's amazing how attitude can make the same drink taste better. Try the pierogies and delicious burgers. There are too many great drinks to pick one favorite, but my advice would be to splurge a little and get a real good one!"}
{"text":"I had the fancy burger with fries, a Ward 8 to drink, and some fig-panna cotta contraption. It was all super delicious, and the bartender was very friendly.  I would say that this place is sophisticated without being stuffy or pretentious."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a burger in Pittsburgh. Anytime we are craving a juicy burger, we head to Butterjoint. Last time we went, we ordered the fancy burger of the day. The burger was great, but we wished we got more fries! Other times we've built our own - which can get expensive, but doesn't discourage our return."}
{"text":"Took a chance on letting bartender make a cocktail, forgot what it is called on the menu. It was fabulous! As far as our burgers go they were excellent."}
{"text":"This little place was amazing!  My friend I went there right after they opened because we knew it was gonna be very hard to get a table. No disappointment! They had really nice bar area and the inside was small but well organized to have as many seats (appreciate!) Food was absolutely fantastic. Every bite of the burger was so juicy and loved the bun was toasted. Fresh to the last bite. Also their pierogi was so good!! Def coming back when I come to Pittsburgh again."}
{"text":"This place in Christian and my opinion takes burgers to a new level, be will warned    bring Bring your appetite great food"}
{"text":"This is my favorite kind of restaurant: casual atmosphere, hip, and excellent food. I love that you can order off of the Legume menu!! The drinks and wine selection were equally solid, I'm into the atmo, and the burger was just YUM. Cooked to a perfect medium-rare, which is hard to do. The toppings were nicely balanced. I had a delicious Templeton Manhattan on the rocks. My glass of rose was refreshing and crisp. I loved my server.   I read some other reviews talking about the crowd, which I can fully imagine. I have been on non-weekends and it was just peachy."}
{"text":"SETTING: Connected to Legume, a small and cozy bar with table seating for small parties (2-4 people). Casual atmosphere, no frills.   FOOD: Burgers. That is all.   I've been to Burgatory a good amount of times, and yes, I like their burgers. BUT Butterjoint's burgers are a notch above in quality. Medium rare and juicy goodness with every bite. Oh. My. Goodness. And this is just the regular burgers. They have burgers of the day too. Comes with crispy fries on the side. I want to say these are some of the best quality burgers I've had.  SERVICE: Waiting staff is average. I think they may have only 1-2 waiters at a time, and sometimes when things get busy, it may take a while for get noticed. They are polite, however, and try to help when they can--they are just busy. This really isn't a restaurant type of setting and more of a bar with seating around it, so I suppose the wait staff reflects that atmosphere.  IMPRESSIONS: Definitely my go to spot when I need a good burger close by to where I live. Pricing is very reasonable and comparable to other burger joints like Burgatory, My advice is to go on off times for a casual early dinner (4pm) or later dinner (9pm) bite since seating is pretty limited. Let me know when you ever have a tough week, I'll meet you here for burgers and drinks. It's the perfect pick me up!"}
{"text":"I don't do burgers at restaurants. I'm always of the mind that burgers are so simple and easy to make at home so I'm not going to pay $10+ for one at a restaurant.  Came here for a friend's birthday last month and I was highly impressed. The whole evening prior to our visit my group was raving about the burgers here and I couldn't imagine that they would be as life changing they made them out to be, but said nothing to deter the groups enthusiasm. On perhaps the biggest restaurant whim in my life, I went along with the group and decided to order one just so I could see what all the fuss was about. I got the fancy burger du jour (grilled ramps and ramp aioli) done medium.  IT WAS THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER CONSUMED. EVER.  (My other top two faves came from Wingharts in Market Square and BRGR in East Liberty).  So juicy, so moist, so delicious. Perfectly cooked. The meat pretty much melts as you bite into it; it was like a symphony of flavors in my mouth.  I would highly recommed trying it out to anyone who is a burger nut.   Oh, and the cocktails were delish too."}
{"text":"I really like what Butterjoint seems to be attempting--a cocktail lounge for non-bros who actually enjoy interesting drinks.  I met up with a group of friends seated in the back corner, and the server came over reasonably quickly to take my drink order.  I ordered a Ninth Ward (on special for $7) and it was fantastic.    However, we were having great difficulty hearing each other over the rather loud music, and the lack of anything soft in the room made being the noise that much more intolerable.  A friend asked our server if there was anything she could do, and her answer (no joke) was \"Well this IS a bar.\"  I definitely would come back here for the delicious cocktails, but if you're trying to attract people who aren't ordering PBR, let them chat and enjoy their drinks.  Butterjoint needs to work a bit harder on allowing the atmosphere to match the high-quality pours."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot for cocktails in an intimate setting.   The cocktails are excellent though not the deepest pours in town.   Mostly burgers on the menu.   Everyone who likes burgers is a fan.   I chose the non meat, burger which wasn't that great and the texture was unexpected.   Next time I will order from the Legume menu.   It's still a favorite spot though.  Long story short, don't get the SOY burger.....but that's my own fault."}
{"text":"First time in Pittsburgh and this is the first food impression. Had a burger that was very good. Service a little on the slow side and that's why the 4 stars. The bartenders seem oblivious to their surroundings at times. They tend to focus on one task and/or customer at a time. It isn't bad just could use some attention and coaching."}
{"text":"The burgers are juicy and seasoned just right. Our waiter was attentive. The drinks are creative. The menu is simple and straight to the point."}
{"text":"I had the best burger tonight. It was so satisfying after a long day at work and visiting with friends. The service was great and we were in and out quickly. I do think that the menu was a bit overpriced for what it was though."}
{"text":"This may be my new favorite place to get a veggie burger. They make theirs with tempeh and it is, hands down, the best tempeh I've ever had in a restaraunt. The burger was soft but didn't fall apart, full of flavor but not too heavy. The cocktails are FANTASTIC. They have a bigger cocktail menu than a lot of restaurants and I was impressed with every one that I tasted. I recommend the Lydia, Beefeater with lime, blueberry aigre-doux and benedictine. It's tart and bitter with a lingering sweetness, perfect summer beverage. The only thing that I didn't care for was that they only have tallow fries. I wish they had vegetarian fries, because what is a burger without fries? The greens were a fine substitute, I suppose."}
{"text":"I was able to have a burger and pierogis on two separate occasions, and both were outstanding. If you get the burger, medium-rare is the way to go. The bar produces well-crafted drinks and even has a delicious root beer on tap! Seating's a bit tight here, so either be ready to sit at the bar or wait. Thanks for being great, Butterjoint!"}
{"text":"First experience at Butterjoint was exceptional! Was unaware you can order anything off of Legume's menu (sister restaurant attached to the left of Butterjoint) until our bartender handed us both menus. Startedwith the pierogies. They serve you four topped with caramelized onions and sour cream. Pierogies are made in-house and you can really tell. The dough was thick and the filling was rich and creamy with lumps of potatoes. They were mouthwatering! Excited to try them next time with an added side. My friend built his own *grass-fed* burger and he too was blown away. Said it's the best burger he's had in Pittsburgh to date. Served with delicious French fries. I ordered the Grilled Escarole salad off of Legume's menu. It was on the smaller side but the flavor was remarkable, with house made croutons, pickled turnips, shaved parmesan, hold the bacon. So delicious, very excited to try more menu items in the future. The draft beer list was also seamless. So many options from local craft breweries including Full Pint, Spoonwood, Grist House, Draai Laag, Arsenal, etc. We were seated at the bar and admired the bar tenders brewing up some elaborate cocktails as well.   Restaurant is pretty small. When you walk through the doors the bar is adjacent to the left wall, with just a few tables around the perimeter. Ambience is really cozy, somewhat romantic. Cannot wait to get back and try some more items."}
{"text":"Hopeless as a restaurant. May be good as a bar which I don't know as I didn't drink. If you are a veggie just forget it. There is nothing. However the service was good for whatever little that was available. The food was a huge ball of salt. Very salty and horrible."}
{"text":"Located adjacent to Legume on Craig Street, Butterjoint is a great little hidden-away bar. I have been to Butterjoint quite a few times and I have always been a fan!  Their beer selection, while a tad small, is quite mighty.  They have a wide array of cocktails and spirits to choose from.  If you can swing it, try to go during happy hour when they have $4 craft beers and $7 cocktail of the day (I know some wines are on sale, too, but I'm not a wine drinker, so I didn't pay that close attention as to what their HH pricing was).   In addition to drinks, they have some of the tastiest burgers in the city.  You really don't need anything crazy on these burgers--just some cheese and light toppings--they are so juicy and delicious all on their own!   My only qualm is that I wish it were a tad larger--that way more people could enjoy this location at a time.  The small, quaint, atmosphere is delightful, though.   If you find yourself reading this review prior to your arrival, check the NO WAIT app and \"get in line\" for a table.  You can drastically reduce your at-the-restaurant wait times with this app."}
{"text":"I thought about panning Butterjoint in this review so I could keep all of the rest of you away, but I think the secret is out. This is the best burger in Pittsburgh. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And if they do they're wrong. They have a pastry chef make the brioche buns. The meat is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The aioli is absurd. The toppings are fresh. The bacon is wonderfully complementary. I wish they'd let me order a sunny side up egg on top of the burger, but that's me picking nits. It's a small dining area, but it doesn't matter. If you want the best burger experience in Pittsburgh, this is where you go. You could get lesser burgers elsewhere for less money, and in fact, I'd prefer you did. More for me."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and can say that the burgers and food in general are fantastic.  I also had the absolute best amaretto sour of my life here.  I am truly lucky to have a place like this a block from my apartment.  That said, there are a couple of reasons why this place gets 3 stars.  1) It's WAY too small.  I don't know a good time you can go and get a seat right away, but I have only been there once when that happened and it was in the middle of a blizzard. 2) The drinks are entirely too expensive.  Happy hour is OK, but I think $10 -$12 for a mixed drink is a bit much.   I get they are trying to be upscale, but I don't understand why there are so few bar choices between \"college dive bar\" and \"overpriced gastropub\" in Oakland.  Of course that's not Butterjoint's fault, but whatever.  Generally, I avoid the place as much as possible because just thinking about having to deal with the shoulder-to-shoulder overcrowded bar gives me social anxiety."}
{"text":"We went to Butterjoint for our last dinner in Pittsburgh and it was so solid. We arrived around 5:15 on a Saturday and had no problem getting a table, but the space is small and filled up fairly quickly. We started with the pierogies which were delicious - almost as good as my grandmom's! The beer list was great and I enjoyed a couple Flying Fish Red Fish pints - this beer paired perfectly with the food.   Next up was the super fancy burger, which had gruyere, tomato, pickles and bacon. I requested the aioli on the side - it had flavors of curry and other spices and was a great dip for the fries. Service was on point and I really liked the vibes overall. My only disappointment was that I was looking forward to trying the sauerkraut balls but was told that the menu is seasonal so they are only offered in colder temps. No worries - I'll be seeking this place out on a future visit for sure!"}
{"text":"Like this joint, it can be a great place for a cocktail, wine, a snack or dinner.   Have stopped by in the past for a cocktail/wine but never to eat.   Was looking for a place to have a late meal but not looking for anything to big, so the small plates and burgers seemed appealing.  While the menu is small it was difficult to pick between a burger and the pierogies.  Ordered a burger but will have to stop back for the pierogies sometime in the future.  My burger was one of the better you are going to get and the fries that came with were great.   Was able to have a nice glass of wine.  The wine list has some nice options.  The bar staff was very nice and busy but was able to spend a little time talking."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I went expecting a great bar food experience on a high end scale. The prices were higher but I figured it must be worth it. I got the \"fancy burger\" but was surprised with the low quality. Sure, the beef was grass fed and local but it didn't stand a quality check. The bun was charred and ruined the taste of the entire burger. The single beer battered onion ring only covered the outer ring of the burger and the cheese clumped off with every bite. I asked for medium well and received welllll done. I've had better $9 burgers at cheap bars with more flavor than the one here. Just because they stamp \"fancy\" on the bun doesn't make it fancy. Ended up spending $46 for two mediocre hamburgers, a beer, and $6 tip. Insane! However, despite the disappointment with the fancy burger and poor patty mixture, the fries were crispy. *yay* They did not have a light lager menu but their bar seemed to be upscale. The service was great as well. They truly did do a great job waiting on us. However, that doesn't really make up for the meal and it'd have to be a place you become accustomed to i suppose."}
{"text":"I went to Butterjoint excited to try what others have labeled \"the best burger in the 'Burgh\".  I have to say, I was disappointed at best.  We started with a couple of orders of pierogies.  I felt they were simply ok, and a bit overpriced for what they were.  I also found it to be misleading that the menu offers kielbasea, but you are served a piece of saussage.  Then, time for the main course - the burgers!  While I ordered my burger to be cooked medium rare, it came out medium well at best.  The bun was toasted lightly, which did add to the burger, but the total amount of bread was just too much.  I felt the flavor of the meat was lacking, and since it was so overdone, it was a bit dry.  The service was adequate, but not superb.  We were served fairly quickly after ordering, which is always nice.  I will say, the one element of the evening that did not disappoint was dessert.  I ordered the chocolate trouffle cake, and must say that it was quite delicious.  It was rich, moist, and chocoloatey - the perfect elements of a dessert.  If you want to try Butterjoint, I suggest visiting BRGR first to get your burger, and then finishing the night with the chocolate trouffle cake.  I was told this is the one dessert that is ALWAYS on the menu."}
{"text":"This place was a big let down. We are here from Atlanta. Firstly, awful service. Very unattentive for such a tiny place. My burger came out without the bacon I ordered. My fries were ordered well done, they were not when they came. They only gave us about 10 fries on each plate, very stingy. The person I came with had requested NO onions with the burger, the burger came out with onions. My soda wasn't refilled the entire meal. Even with all of these problems, the server was not apologetic and almost seemed annoyed to be serving us. We asked for a different side other than fries bc they were so greasy, but they don't have any other options. We asked for something as simple as ranch dressing, they don't have ranch. Just an amazing culmination of let downs one after the next. To top it off there is zero parking outside, so good luck!  The burger was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"One of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh and I am lucky enough to live within stumbling distance! :D  When you step into Butterjoint, it feels like a cozy speakeasy. Due to its popularity, it is particularly busy around happy hour time. But if you can find a seat, the snacks are great (some friends like the goat cheese pepper jelly crostini, not a fan of goat cheese myself but in case you are!), or if you're in the mood for a delicious fancy burger (almost $20 so it's VERY fancy haha), it's one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh. Of course, the drinks are also pretty good, they have a solid wine menu, and a long draft beer list.  If you're wanting to catch up with a friend or a small group or want to know where to take a date, Butterjoint is a great place to go!"}
{"text":"Loved the vibe in this bar! Dark wood, dim lighting, eclectic bottles of booze... Beware: it's teeny and gets very crowded right after work.  They have a menu for bar food and an interesting (lots of local and uncommon liquids) cocktail menu. My daughter loved the burger, and husband thought the polish sausage was great. I ordered from the Legume menu and enjoyed a delicious Legume dinner while relaxing at the bar.  The service from the bartenders was top notch. They were cool, attentive, and helpful, which boosted the already great ambiance."}
{"text":"I love a good cocktail.  I mean, who doesn't?  This place provides just that.  The menu offers some excellent choices and, if you're open-minded, you can put yourself at \"The Mercy of the Bartender.\"  It a cocktail made of whatever they are feeling that day.  Now it was my first visit, so I just did a bourbon cocktail and MAN.  It was spectacular.  The ingredients blended beautifully and the bartender was really cool to boot.  Drinks average $9-$12, but they are worth every penny.  The ambiance is kind of sexy: just dim enough with lots of beautiful wood tones.  There is a tv, which I noticed they had on for the Pirates playoff run.  But as soon as the game was over, that tv went off I'm glad to report!  Now there were 2 tables I noticed that had damned near spotlights directly overhead.  Sit there if you're on a date with someone you're just not so sure you'd like to see again (or with friends, since no once cares about being sexy).    This place is connected to Legume, so while I didn't eat here I am sure the food is amazing.  I have already raved about it to several friends and will continue to do so. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great place if you want a mixed cocktail and a bartender with awesome facial hair.  I would say this place is kind of like 1947 but better.  It's got the fancy but not too fancy vibe to it.  The staff is really friendly and the ambiance is very warm.  I would come back if I wanted a well made drink or even try some of legume's food without the huge price.  Also, the happy hour specials are great including $2 beers.  Not something I would expect from a place this fancy looking."}
{"text":"The environment is great, but it can get really noisy.  Also regarding the food - while it is generally good, the choices are very limited and have not changed much in my experience."}
{"text":"Great burgers and fries although a little pricey I think the burger was worth it.    They are stingy on the amount of fries you get.   Wait staff just OK, they guy tried to remember everything instead of writing it down....never works.  Got a medium burger rather than well done but it was very tastey, so much that I didn't send it back to get re-done...all in all recommended."}
{"text":"I've done happy hour at the Butterjoint several times now and I LOVE their $10 carafe of wine special. This is NOT the place for a large group, but great for a intimate party of 2-3. The menu looks promising, I need to go back and at least try the tartare. I'd recommend getting here early, because the bar area fills up. This is a great spot on N. Craig!"}
{"text":"This is the best burger I have had in Pittsburgh. Great bar atmosphere with terrific drink selection. I will be back on a regular basis."}
{"text":"If you're into BACON and burgers, this would be a great place to stop.   My wife and I went there as we were passing through Pittsburgh. We tumbled across this place using Yelp! The reviews were pretty good and this was the only place that was serving food past 11pm.   Immediately walking in, we were greeted by the bartender. The service was all around good, which makes a world of a difference. My wife and I both orders the \"Fancy burger of the day\". The burger had bacon cured in house, locally grounded beef, and different toppings which I wish I could remember all of them. All I remember is that the burger was good.   I thought I would be upset because the menu was small, but after thinking about it, a small menu gives them a better chance at perfecting their foods. My assumption was correct. That was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. That and a beer, my night was set!    The environment made for a nice chill bar with great people enjoying the night. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Butterjoint's sleek wooden bar and crisp $5 white wines provided a welcome respite from the 91 degree Oakland streets. We opened the place at 4:30, securing a coveted seat at the bar and were promptly welcomed and watered by a bartender. Happy Hour prices are a steal - $5 wines, house, but pretty good by house wine standards. Our group sampled a few of the small plates which left us all wanting more.  On the burger, \"The burger was like meat-butter. Caramelized onions paired with gruyere melted to make a French onion soup kinda-burger, which was melt in your mouth good.\"    On the pierogis, \"A comforting mix of cheese and potato fluff. Filling and delicious with greens, onions and kielbasa creating a salty crunch.\"  On the tartare, \"A dippy egg laden masterpiece - the perfect combination of salty and savory.\"  Learned that several of my favorite menu items are seasonal, making Butterjoint a regular on my 'must-visit' list."}
{"text":"This little bar is adjacent to Legume.  There is a bar menu for snacks but you can also order from the Legume menu.  I got the baba ganoush and a beer thinking I'd just stay for a drink.  The crowd was lively and the bartenders were quite attractive.  Although I am a sucker for a nice guy in hipster glasses.  There is a great selection of beer on tap (in particular Fat Head's The Sorcerer).   I stayed for a few more beers and ordered a plate of pierogies.  You either know how to make a pierogie or you don't and these guys knew what they were doing.    This is a nice little neighborhood bar close to the University of Pittsburgh. You leave feeling a little drunk and a little sentimental about the Pittsburgh experience."}
{"text":"I wish I had taken more advantage of living so close to Butterjoint, because the cocktails and desserts here are great - it's hard to pick just one dessert!   On my most recent visit, I had a Spanish coffee, beef burger with the fixings of the tempeh version (miso mayo and kimchi) and the cardamom pot de creme. I didn't taste too much cardamom in the pot de creme, but it was the perfect consistency and sweetness. The black walnut cake and honey tea cake also sounded wonderful.   The burgers are huge and quite good here, but I don't think they're quite worth the $14-20 you could easily end up spending with the toppings. I definitely prefer Butterjoint for the seasonally changing cocktails and desserts."}
{"text":"Oh, the balls!!! Those sauerkraut balls! Why not start off by talking about those delicious fried, cheesy, homemade sauerkraut filled balls! I could start a whole Schweaty Balls type commentary on them, they were that good.  It's no surprise, considering Butterjoint is connected with Legume, the equally as amazing restaurant next door. The bar is pretty much the same as it was before. Still dark, romantic and cozy, but with an expanded drink and appetizer menu. Brilliant move on their part because they'll attract people to the bar casually, then suck them in for the promise of delicious food next door!  For my drink I went with my old favorite, the Papa Dobé, which had Mt. Gay Eclipse Rum, Maraschino Liqueur, grapefruit and lime. I just can't get away from a drink with grapefruit. It's so refreshing, and this certainly did the trick. I also enjoy these well made cocktails because, although it's quite small, it's strong and meant to be sipped. Rather than a mixed drink thrown together at an average run of the mill bar that you suck down in five seconds because there's no liquor in it. No thanks.  We also ordered up the pierogie appetizer. Also, accompanied by homemade sauerkraut, which is the perfect blend of sweet and sour. The pierogies are made in house as well, and were crispy, but not burnt, filled with a potato and cheese blend that combined the best of two fine ingredients.  See, they hook you in. Because it made me think... \"Rachel, you must head back to Legume, stat!\" It did the trick simple as that, all it took were some tasty balls!"}
{"text":"Butterjoint has the space and atmosphere of a dive.  Which is great, right?  Well, in a word, no.  Butterjoint is not the dive that you love but rather the dive that you never want to go back to.  It has a reputation for making good cocktails, or so I've been told, and I can only imagine that reputation is used to mask a food menu that is uninspired in both design and execution.  I have eaten here twice, once with friends and the other time with my girlfriend.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Ambiance: See above, I know of hole-in-the-walls just south of Washington Square Park in New York that have more ambiance in the limited curb appeal than this cramped and hot space.  Service: The service was fantastic the first time I went but I accredit this to the fact that my friends knew the people that worked here.  The second time, without that built-in relationship and rapport, my girlfriend and I were consistently ignored throughout the entire meal.  We were not greeted at the door.  We were not shown to a table.  It took ten minutes before anyone noticed that no server was taking our table, during which time our soon-to-be waitress gave a great big bear hug to, wait for it, someone that she knew.  No silverware was given with our meal.  The list goes on.  The bottom line is that quality of service is not measured by how you treat the regulars but how you perform on a consistent basis with any random customer.  Butterjoint would do well to learn and observe this maxim.  Food: I've eaten better burgers at the chain restaurant Five Guys.  The perogies might as well have been Mrs. Ts from the freezer.  And the fries, I don't know how they tasted because they were cold and not worth even trying.  Burgers are an everyman type of food that is genuinely hard to make bad.  Butterjoint is impressive in that respect since it managed to do that very thing.  Price: Unreasonable cost for a burger that tastes like this.  I'd rather go to Five Guys to save money and have a much better burger.  The reputation for good cocktails: I can't speak on it since I ordered a beer; not a cocktail.  Given the aforementioned comments, I have to believe there are other trendy spots in Pittsburgh to quench my alcoholic thirst than this place.    In summary, if you're hungry look elsewhere.  If you have a craving for a cocktail, I'm sure you can find a place that combines an inviting and comfortable ambiance with tasty concoctions."}
{"text":"Butterjoint!! So much love.  The local burger of the day is always outrageous, and the cocktails are well-crafted (try the Sazerac or the Full Stop). There a few really cool booths in the back, but it's not easy to get a seat here. That'd be my only wish for Butterjoint: for it to be twice as wide and half as crowded (the narrowness of the bar means there's nowhere to stand without being in the way if you're waiting)."}
{"text":"The burgers here are so good. My boytoy (HAHA) has tried a lot of burgers and he thinks that Butterjoint has the best burgers that he's ever had, so of COURSE I had to try it too. We both got the fancy burger which had tomato, cheddar, and pesto aioli. And I have to say that this burger was pretty damn good!!  $16 is pretty steep for broke recent college graduate, but if you're someone who appreciates the quality of a good meat patty compared to the toppings, you'll really enjoy this burger. Super flavorful and juicy all the way through, not dry at all. The bun was perfectly toasted and light! The toppings on the burger enhanced the flavor of the meat patty without taking away/masking it. The fries were super delicious as well.   It was pretty busy around the time that we stopped by but we were able to snag a seat at the bar. The bartender was super nice and attentive to us, making sure we had everything that we needed always. I would love to stop by here again some other time."}
{"text":"Butterjoint was highly recommended to me, so I figured I would come try the \"best burger in town.\" Our waiter was not particularly attentive, but he was knowledgeable and able to provide me with a good recommendation. I started with the bluefish pate from Legume's menu, and then had a basic burger with the cave-aged gruyere cheese. It was great. The fries were very good, and the meat itself was juicy and flavorful. I was not a huge fan of the bun, but overall was very pleased with my meal."}
{"text":"Butterjoint is one of my fav spots for Happy Hour.  Most of their craft drafts are 4 bucks, and I love their rotating selection (Pumking in the fall, Mad Elf in the winter, and local breweries are also featured).  It is busy here during HH, so go sooner than later, esp on a Friday.  I've been there on a Monday with no issues.  On a Fridays, it's a different story.  If you don't get there before 5, you'll be standing.  The decor gives off a speak-easy vibe, and the bartenders and wait staff match, with hipster staches and clothes.  Parking can be a pain, but is free on the street after 6.  If you work in Oakland and plan to head to Butterjoint, I advise leaving your car where it's at and walk.  The full Legume menu is available at Butterjoint.  I've never ordered food here, as I prefer to concentrate on beer.  My friends and coworkers have raved about the food, though, esp the burger.  I plan to try it next time I'm there, which I'm sure won't be too long!"}
{"text":"What's not to love about this laid-back lair in Oakland? A well curated draft list, good service, delightful ambiance, and cast-of-characters crowd provide for an ideal venue for a second date or nightcap. The Fries + Aioli were simple yet addictive; in fact, the full Legume menu is available 'til 9:00.  A return trip is surely in order (read: burger), but expect to pay for the refinement."}
{"text":"It is sad for me to give Butterjoint only three stars because just two months ago this would have been a five star review. Unfortunately, the hamburgers are no longer living up to the standards that originally were established. Butterjoint had been our \"go to\" place for burgers - delicious food, easy access and consistent. No more. The past three times have not been good and each time for the exact same reasons. The \"extra fancy\" burger is meant to come with bacon. Last night, two of the four had no bacon and two had just one piece of bacon. The toppings used to consist of (for example) fried or sauteed onion rings or kimchi, always paired with cheese and a variety of other distinctive options. Now, all we get are a few semi-pickled cucumbers with uninspired cheese. And the fries that were always crispy, abundant and very easy to share have been under cooked and very stingy. The meat is still good, but for the price - and even for less - there are much better burgers within walking distance. Our inference is that there is an effort being made to cut costs - if so, it really shows and has turned us off completely. If not, then this calls for new kitchen help to assure consistency of quality and variety in the burger toppings offered on the daily special."}
{"text":"Came to Butterjoint with one of my friends that I've known since 1st grade and had a damn good. The atmosphere was lively on a Friday evening filled with people looking to have a good time with friends.  The food we ordered was quality! The Goat Cheese Crostini with Pepper Jam gets 5 stars. The burger was cheese and cooked to my liking. I had it with caramelized onions, cheddar cheese and bacon, which all were extra items that were an addition charge. I give this burger 5 stars. The only negative about Butterjoint was the dessert menu. After reviewing it I should have said check please, but I opted to try the Chocolate Truffle Cake. I didn't like this at all and wouldn't get it again.  All and all I enjoyed Butterjoint and would visit this spot again next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"One of my favorite post work bars in Pittsburgh. Perfect for a cold day. Cozy bar, great menu, and excellent beer selection."}
{"text":"The 5 stars are for the cocktails. I can honestly say re the Prince Edward: i've never tasted anything quite like it in my entire life. Also had the one with absinthe and grapefruit-- so well-crafted, so delicious! I would say that the food was good too but probably more of a four star. Go there for the cocktails and beer!"}
