{"text":"If you're parched and you're in the Pacific Place Mall than Bubblicious is where you oughta get to. They offer an amazing array of bubble tea flavours served up swiftly and sweetly. The mango flavour is a particular favourite of mine. I've had it both with tapioca pearls and without and it turns out it's an order you can't mess up. Both ways are awesome. It packs a lot more real fruit flavour than a lotta the other bubble teas I've tried. It also costs a wee bit more than a lotta bubble teas I've had, but it should, because it's better. You get what you pay for at Bubblicious - fantastic fruit flavour."}
{"text":"I like the selections here and they claim that they use real fruits.  It does taste a bit better than the one close by the pho restaurant in the same mall but it's more expensive.  My favourite is the watermellon perl.  I've also tried the mango and avacado but I didn't like that too much.  
If you don't want to pay too much, ask them for the regular cup versus the large.  $6.45 is a bit too much for bubble tea I think."}
{"text":"If you enjoy bubble tea this is definitely the place to be. They always have fresh ingredients on hand and are quick to serve. The staff are always friendly and I really appreciate the fact that they will do special requests for their customers. If you enjoy something lighter and not too sweet I recommend the lychee green tea otherwise, all their fresh fruit drinks are highly recommended."}
{"text":"I am a bubble fiend and I'd have to say this is the best place to get your fix in Calgary! Aside from their fresh fruits and ingredients, they have always shown me exceptional service. It's hard not to have the best smoothies when your located right next to a huge supermarket! 

I recommend this to all true bubble tea lovers."}
{"text":"You can't go to Pacific Place Mall/ T&T Market without getting bubble tea from here!

Although their set up is a big dingy and there's always boxes piled up by the counter, their drinks are amazing.

When possible, I opt for the fresh fruit bubble teas. My fave would be fresh watermelon with milk and pearls :)"}
{"text":"Alright y'all, it's your self-proclaimed bubble tea whore checking in.

So I told you where to get PRETTY good bubble tea and ALRIGHT bubble tea in Calgary, but now it's time for me to tell you where to get the ABSOLUTE BEST bubble tea in the city.

Bubblicious is a little joint located inside Pacific Place Mall. They don't even have a phone number or a website, but what they DO have is the best bubble tea you will EVER have.

I urge you to try the Strawberry-Mango fresh fruit slushy. It's to die for. 

I'll tell you right now - you do have to pay a little extra for the good stuff. The average bubble tea in Calgary costs between $4.75 - $5.75. At Bubblicious, the drink I mentioned costs $6, but TRUST me...the chump change is worth it! 

The right amount of bubbles, the perfect taste, all in one glass. Try it out and let me know what YOU think!"}
{"text":"With all the recent talks about \"hole in the wall\" joints, I'm pretty sure Bubble Tea shops largely occupy this category. Sure a lot of Thai and Vietnamese places them these days but often as a feature item. But strictly Bubble Tea shops rarely exist outside of Chinatown and the Forest Lawn area.

Save for this gem. Bubblicious has been around for a few years and tucked away in a corner of Pacific Palace. You'd almost miss it when you walk in given you're gaze is directed towards TNT and the food court, but look right (or left if you're passing by TNT) and you'll see Bubblicious. The funny thing about this place is that the owners seem to barely care about the look of the place, there are some tables you can sit at for a while but most of the place is riddled with boxes that makes the whole place look like a storage room.

But aside from that Bubblicious makes BOMB Bubble Teas. They'll serve the generic powdered stuff just to satisfy the masses, but they also make their shakes from real ingredients. Real TARO trumps Powdered TARO any day. I've also had their Mango (also made with fresh mango) and sometimes switched to try the Tapioca.

The prices are cheap, it's hard to get a decent Bubble Tea or Shake under $5 around this lunatic city, but Bubblicious is right under that threshold. So if you're cute and I happen to hear you shyly say to me \"allow me to treat you for some Bubble Tea\", then you are more than welcome to ;)"}
{"text":"Visiting from San Francisco and needed to see what calgary's bubble tea scene was like. Iced cappuccino was okay and coconut mango smoothie with boba was pretty solid although pricey ($6)."}
{"text":"Have been to this place since I was kid, always loved their bubbleteas- definitely taste one of the best for me.  Sadly, I noticed their prices have gone up quite a bit (rather expensive), but it's worth it considering the taste :)."}
