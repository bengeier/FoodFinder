{"text":"I hate to disagree with all of the lovely reviews below, but I was actually extremely underwhelmed by this place! I wanted to like it, and I've wanted to try it for a while, so when I was on my way to a doctor's appointment at TEGH, instead of going to the Tim Hortons in the hospital, I stopped at this place.
The guy working was great, he kept the place nice and tidy and was quick with the service, but the coffee was just ok and the pastry I had was... not very good.
That, and it's just not very cozy. I expected it to be a little more homey, considering it's small and, well, a cafe, but it was just a hard bench and some of your regular diner chairs and tables.
Because of all of the great reviews, I'd probably go back and give it another try, but as of right now... not such a fan."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Lots of variety  It's a mystery to me why they close so early. I'd be in more often if they were open evenings too (right now they close at six on wknds)"}
{"text":"Nice vibe to this neighbourhood place that boasts a patio on a side street. However, if you are serious about coffee and appreciate independents like Mercury, Crema, Rooster etc., this coffee will not stand up."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since 2009, and if there were more stars to give I would happily give them!  

Hidden on a sidestreet, the Last Drop Cafe has delicious baked goods, and the deli sandwiches are made with awesomely fresh ingredients for great prices (under $6 for a meat sandwich complete with chips on the side). Their hot chocolate is awesome in winter (marshmellows AND whipped cream!), and their treats are super-tasty (cookies, muffins, banana bread, and squares). The two owners are incredibly friendly and upbeat - I have been visiting weekly while getting treated at the hospital and they never fail to make my day with pleasant smalltalk and many smiles. The cafe itself is a comfortable place to pass time (e.g. reading the paper, catching up on some worK) - it's bustling with people but never so busy that it gets overly loud, and there is free wifi. 

I don't know where the people complaining about price usually go to eat, but compared to Starbucks where you get frozen/heated baked goods and coffee chain service this small business is so superior and for the things that I usually get way cheaper (I buy a drink, beef sandwich with chips & a couple carrots, and a baked good such as chocolate cake for less than $12... McDonald's is rarely that cheap, and I definitely cannot get a full and tasty lunch from SB, but easily spend the same amount for less). And frankly, I would far sooner have my money going to an independent local business than feeding into yet another corporation.

Overall, this is a really amazing cafe in the East end, and my hands down favourite cafe / lunch spot in Toronto."}
{"text":"Go to this place when I need caffeine and feel like walking. Nice little patio in the summer, wonderfully nice people that own and operate it, good food and good drinks. In east york, hard to come by. Free WiFi and generally comfortable environment."}
{"text":"beautiful coffee shop with a nice ambiance. the barista with orange hair made THE BEST LATTE I'VE EVER HAD!!! she was so sweet and the service was quick and phenomenal- would highly recommend for a decently price latte accustomed with excellent customer service"}
{"text":"So this place is a gem! Very cozy and quiet. And the locals here are supper friendly. Literally met a guy by the name of Cobra who had a watch with a cobra on it who told me a great deal about his town. But I digress... the americano is fantasticly brewed right before you. I also had the ham and cheese quiche with comes with some potato chips. For a dessert I had a lemon square and a butter tart which dissapeared into my mouth before I could take a picture haha. If you're in the area definitely make it a point to come visit this place for a great cup of coffee and for the pastries."}
{"text":"I've been here several times; the pastries are tasty and reasonably priced.   The sandwich my friend had was good according to her.   Clean washroom, very friendly.   Good location for the hospital.    Parking is available in lot or street but harder to find free parking because of the hospital.   Free street parking is limited to 1 hour on side streets.    Close to Coxwell bus which goes to the subway on Danforth."}
{"text":"We hit this place after waiting in line at 8am in the rain to register for a library course for the kids (silly mommies, babies can't READ!) because we needed a warm up. My friend had been there about two weeks before and had said that the muffin's were great and so I opted for a lemon cranberry goodie and SO glad that I did. The baked goods were truly delish and moist and EVERYTHING looked good. 

My only complaint was the general pricing. The muffin itself was reasonable but a medium chai latte for $4? I'm sorry are you Starbucks?? No, because your sizing isn't pretentious and called grande, that's how I know you aren't Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is a nice little cafe. It's not what you'd expect for the neighbourhood, and I love that. There is Starbucks and Tim Hortons around, but not many independent places. It's clean, the staff seem friendly, and the coffee is good.  I got an americano and a chocolate butter tart. It came to about $5. The americano was perfect. The tart was tasty but not mind blowing. It was a good compliment to the coffee and I appreciated the chocolate twist instead of a just a plain butter tart. I'll go back."}
{"text":"Saturday, September 13, 2014:

This is about as local as it gets--I'm literally just a few houses west of this place.  Why the heck did it take me 4 years to visit???

You can have food here or the usual coffee beverages.  There is good seating inside and a nice little patio outside.  I just had an espresso but would love to come back and drink a Steam here on a sunny, warm day.  

The staff seem friendly.  They know my downstairs neighbour because he popped in and was clearly a regular.  

My guess is that this place exists to mostly serve the immediate area including General East Hospital.  It is a nice place and I'll be more often."}
{"text":"Nice service.  But everything here is bland and lame. Latte was effectively warm milk with brown food colouring. Sandwiches were consumed only because of pure physiological hunger. The only flavour came from a ketchup packet. 

Pretty sure that all of their customers come from the hospital, waiting for people to come out of surgery. 

But yeah, they're nice."}
{"text":"What a beautiful little gem of a diamond in the rough!!! Look! It's the very rare related-mixed-metaphor!

ANYWAY dropped in here for lunch. I was at East York Civic Centre for a day-long workshop. I used my trusty Timmy's app to find the nearest location (I was craving a bagel) and it told me it was in East York Hospital - PERFECT!!! Right across the street! So after wandering around hospital corridors for 10 minutes, I finally found it, behind scaffolding and not open until next week. CRAP. 

So I started walking... and ran into Last Drop!

WHAT A FABULOUS SURPRISE! I love it! The girls working were so friendly and cheerful it picked up my entire afternoon - and the bagel & cream cheese was awesome, to boot! I also got a San Pellegrino.

I gather this place is a neighbourhood hotspot as it was super busy when I was there (granted, it was primo lunch crunch) and there are a bunch of other great reviews.

Highly recommend. The pastries look AMAZING though I did not partake (I have a severe tree nut allergy so avoid as a rule) - but the coffee is fantastic - I did try that! :)"}
{"text":"Loved it. Great sandwich for a reasonable price. It also had a large bathroom (much more accessible that I would expect for a small cafe) with a change table and they had a high chair available too. Makes it so much easier for moms or nannies getting out for a cup of coffee and snack."}
{"text":"LDC is an okay cafe.  The storefront looks small-townish, which is cute as it is located right in the middle of Toronto.  I ordered a Montreal Smoked Meat Sandwich and a coffee.  The sandwich came with chips and 2 baby carrots.  The sandwich was quite delicious.  The cucumber slices topping was especially fresh.  The coffee was okay for a speciality cafe.

There is free Wifi.  There is wine offering but I didn't order it, so I could not comment on it.

Overall, LDC is a neat cafe across the hospital.  It provides an alternative to boring hospital cafeteria food."}
{"text":"Very yummy baked goods, coffee is okay too. I remember when they used to give a lot of chips and veggies with there sandwiches, now you only get a small handfull of chips and 3 carrots:( 
  If you came across last drop in the winter go in and get a hot chocolate, they are very yummy. Or a latte, very good:D"}
{"text":"Quaint little place in Coxwell area, serving the best almondlicious  almond milk latte. I ordered mine with double espresso shot along with a apple cranberry muffin which was equally delicious and glutinous! Coffee roast is definitely legit!"}
{"text":"BEST \"ice to coffee ratio\" of any iced coffee or iced cappuccino I have ever tried (and I've worked at Tim Hortons and Starbucks), lots of seating, Wifi and has that \"downtown indie coffee shop\" feel without the crowds or pretension. This place is very much needed in the suburban no man's land that is \"Old East York Village\""}
{"text":"I can't really say I have not tasted the food I would truly like to know if it's real certified Angus or that Canadian stuff they call Angus. If they get it from the butcher shop it's the crap. I'm sorry but it looks like regular pub food to me"}
{"text":"This is a great place for coffee, tea, pastries, and more. They even have toys for the little ones."}
