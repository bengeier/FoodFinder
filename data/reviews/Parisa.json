{"text":"We ordered kabab koobideh.The food quality is medicore not that much special. We ordered bean soup( Ash resteh) but we couldn't find any beans or noddle inside the soup! Also the food was so expensive relative to portions since the restaurant is not a fancy place.They charged us 5$ for sharing the food! They said that you get more rice and salad..."}
{"text":"Portions were small, prices on the higher range compared to other Persian restaurants in Montreal. Taste and quality was average. Rice itself was best part as well as byow. We had ash, koobideh and kashk bademjan."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday and the service was good and quick.. we went on a Tuesday night and the resto was pretty empty. We were a big party (around 10) and ordered a main dish for everyone and shared everything as well as the soup to start and some eggplant dips for appies. The soup was really delicious and only $1.50 with a main dish - definitely get one - I really enjoyed it! Lots of flavour and lots of things in the soup... very savourly and delish. The eggplant dips were also very tasty. We tried a variety of mains and the table generally liked them all. I am only giving it 3 stars because Persian food is not my favourite... it is a bit too savoury without any spice. I would say the dishes were similar in taste to Khyber Pass on Duluth."}
{"text":"While visiting Montreal we had to try persian food, knowing that in Canada there is such a big persian population. I don't know what I was thinking, but I thought that due to huge persian population, I expected better persian food than in all  Persian restaurants in NYC, which had tried numerous times in the past ten years.  Paris's was worst persian restaurant ever! When we arrived and seated us and show have began....the waiter was nice, but it seemed that he must started working first day, was so disorganized, was jumping from table to table, seemed so lost. I ordered salmon kebab, and they said sorry we don't have it. My husband ordered soltani, which is main typical persian food (some beef kebab and beef skirt stake kebab), and he said that they don't have it to, it's even not in the menu. I was shocked! Later I have ordered shrimp kebab with green rice. And my husband ordered some beef steak. Omg, our food came out literally two hours later and I never seen the rice brought for me. The rice looked nothing like they supposed to, it was a mix of different rice colors and so oily and even had no peas in there. It looked nothing like suppose to. My husbands dish looked better, meat was soft but  I guarantee it had MSG in there, because my husband s allergic to MSG and the night we got home he had a severe allergic attack. What a disappointment and waste of time and money this place was! If you never tried persian food , maybe it will seem ok, but if you are familiar with persian cuisine , stay away of this place, this is nothing even close persian food. I been to all persian restaurants in entire east coast, but this  I would stay away from!!!"}
{"text":"their traditional soup has a mix of mint and yogourt and beans which sounds bad but was a party in my mouth!"}
{"text":"This is restaurant is by far the best fine Persian cuisine i have had experienced...and im a kebab lover!! First thing is make sure u RESERVE,..for the week ends! Jammed but very warm and cozy...a little noisy although but i like it like that! The service is most attentive specially when it's so busy! As for the food, we where 4 and had a little bit of everything and it  was done too perfection..i mean the meat was well seasoned and juicy.. Just wow!! And my personnel favorite was the lambs shank plate...off the hook!!! This is absolutely a great place for price to quality and not to forget that it is a bring your wine....!!!! Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"We decided to try Parisa after hearing about some bring your wine restaurants in Mtl on the radio.  This was the first Persian restaurant I've been to, and it was delicious!   We all started with the 'ash e reshteh' soup - a bean, dill and noodle soup. It was great! We then had an entree of sautéed mushrooms (full of flavour and a bit tart with a pomegranate based sauce) and grilled eggplant dip with pita (also very good). (Appetizer prices from 1.50 (soup on special!) to about $6)  I tried a bit of everything our table ordered (main plates $13-16): 'koobideh' - a ground lamb and beef brochette. It was delicious, but a little undercooked in the center for my taste. 'jujeh'- marinated chicken breast - good but too salty.  'chekertemeh' - a chicken stew which was full of rich flavour. 'shrin polo' - a vegetarian saffron basmati rice dish. It was amazing and tasted so fresh - Orange zest, peppers, almonds, barberries (tart little fruit).    All dishes came with basmati rice, salad and grilled tomatoes.   The service was very good - and the BYOB is a definite plus!   Will definitely go back! Make sure to make reservations on the weekend - they only seat at 5:30 or 8:30pm."}
{"text":"I went with a friend I hadn't seen for a while, and we had so much to talk about that the food was almost an afterthough... almost. It was the second time I went to an Iranian restaurant, so I had an approximate idea what to expect. I went for the Table d'hôte; the main dish was good but not exceptional : grilled chicken, saffron rice and salad, a well-balanced and healthy dish. The chicken was marinated in what I guess is a mix of lemon juice, a bit of mint and different spices, and was rather tasty. But the thing that you'll remember if you go there is the lentil soup in entrée... really something. In fact, It's worth going to Parisa just for the lentil soup, and they seem to be quite famous for it.  It's hard to know exactly what went into this soup, when you rely only on your tastebuds: the taste is complex, lots of different flavors with a dominant of mint and lemon again (hey, this is middle-east cuisine), comforting but fresh, tasty and subtle.  This is a fine restaurant, maybe not the one you'll remember for the rest of your life, but the kind that you want to go to once in a while."}
{"text":"What a little surprise in the heart of Verdun..  We heard of this place through a friend, and having had authentic spectacular Persian food before, I was quite skeptical. However, Parisa did not disappoint!  Their house soup was really something special (minus the random noodles that seemed out of place).  We had the sauteed mushrooms to start - I expected them to be sweeter, but they were quite good!  We then had the lamb (AMAZING) and the chicken drumsticks (not bad) as our main dish.  The service was great, the host was super friendly, and the atmosphere was nice and quiet.   For a BYOW place, it's definitely a nice place to go. Try it, and definitely do not miss out on the soup! Super good!"}
{"text":"Incredible evening !  Came with a group of four for our friends birthday it was her first time and she loved it.  We started off with calamari the mushrooms and the spinach and yogurt dip with pita. Very good and flavourful.  Had a fantastic plate meat was very tender I would recommend the stews. The salad dressing is to die for it's very unique u can't miss it comes with most the plates.  One of the best Byow in verdun :)"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. A little pricey.  Although I enjoyed the food - I had an Iranian friend with me who kept saying the dishes weren't genuine Persian."}
{"text":"Love this place.  They have the best food and service.  I recommend all my friends to come here when they are looking for something new and yummy."}
{"text":"This is my first foray into Persian food, ever! I look forward to trying out more in the future, and as a newbie to the cuisine, I'm definitely lucky to have tried it at a place that was good and with a guide. I came here with fellow Yelper Bobby, so you might notice that we have similar commentary, but different takes.  Now first things first, ambience: I found the restaurant quaint, the only issue is that their table layout was a bit weak.  I'm unsure if this is due to the 3 or 4 parties of 5+ people (one table seemed about 10) but it was packed when we came in. We didn't make a reservation because we didn't expect to, but to be on the safe side, if it's a weekend, call ahead. The colours were warm, and overall, I'd have to say it was nicely lit, and great windows looking out. The restaurant itself was a bit cold, considering how many people were inside, and I still kept my scarf on the entire dinner.  Service: This restaurant seems like it would give you the most attentive service if it was moderately busy, but overall, we were in for dinner for over 2 hours. It was a wait to order, then we had to swap tables because the server couldn't reach the table beside us, then another table of people had to swap. Our server was very amicable, but you could tell that she seemed a bit frazzled, which is understandable due to the amount of people there. Paying our bill was a long wait too, but we weren't rushed for anything after so it was fine.  Food: My first impression of our appetizers, mushrooms and an eggplant mixutre: tasty, zesty, and I would love to have that again.  I had a chicken breast kebab, with rice, salad, and grilled tomato.  The chicken was well-seasoned, the salad dressing was nice, and the saffron rice with Barberries was my first and I loved it! The grilled tomato though lacked in tasted, and it was charred beyond recognition.  The one thing to remember it is BYOW (Apportez votre vin), and for their prices, I thought they were decent and on par."}
{"text":"Pour la St-Valentin, Alex et moi avons décidé de découvrir un peu le quartier. Notre premier choix était Su, mais ils n'offraient qu'un menu dégustation à 65$. Nous avons donc décidé de le découvrir une prochaine fois. Après lecture des avis de tout le monde sur le Parisa, j'étais un peu indécise, mais Alex a tranché et nous n'avons pas été déçus.   Petit restaurant apportez votre vin, décor très simple (rien de fancy) et service poli.  Comme nous sommes deux gourmands épicurieux, nous avons choisi plusieurs plats sur le menu, quite à en rapporter à la maison. La soupe était selon nous incroyable!! Les champignons, suggérés par Risa et Noha était aussi délicieux. Les calmars frits étaient un peu fads, mais une fois trempés dans la sauce des champignons devenaient un peu plus intéressants. Ensuite comme plat principal, nous avons pris l'assiette de brochette de bavette et celle avec la brochette de crevettes. C'était bon, mais sans plus je dirais. Overall une expérience agréable.   Je reviendrai définitivement pour la soupe, un gros \"bucket\" à part de ça!"}
{"text":"I totally agree with Noha's review below, this place is A-Ok and pretty great - and I'll add that if you are down in the Verdun area looking for a hearty and filling BYO, something for all tastes with very warm friendly service, this is a sweet bet.   We arrived at 5:30 with a group of 5 and were given the cosy booth. We laughed and chatted with the waiter and popped across the street to grab beers. We enjoyed the soup starter, super tasty flavours and textures, and the mushroom app was my favourite dish of the night, next time I'd do that and one of the dips with pita I think, I could just eat that all night.   For my main I went for the salmon. I wish the waiter could have confidently said oh yah, this is sustainable fish! But the vegetarian dishes weren't appealing to me, so I went for it. The rice was tasty and so was the salmon. My dinner companions ordered the lamb and loved it, and the shrimp and thought it was ok, and the salmon and veggie skewers, also ok.   We had a lovely moment together at Parisa and the quantity of the portions was super generous and there are some great flavours at play."}
{"text":"Food is really good but prices and portions does not match reality. I like the fact that they have option of BYOW ( bring your own wine) but this is not fancy restaurant, this is a usual casual place but prices they charge and portions they bring are totally totally not adequate. Portions are small pries are high!!! Thank you"}
{"text":"This was such a great experience. I cannot wait to go back. The service and the food were both amazing. Also the food presentation was also beautiful. It's a great place to take date to or go with a group of friends. I went with a group of friends and the service truly deserves a 5 star. When you go there make sure to try the filet mignon. Also the appetizers and the stews are to die for.  I cannot believe someone gave this place a 3 star based on the fact that they don't like Persians food even though the food was amazing. Enjoy"}
{"text":"I am no Iranian food connoisseur, but I was extremely pleased by my visit at Parisa. On a Saturday evening, my husband and I spontaneously stumbled in without reservation (oops), but the waiter was kind enough to find us a spot near the window at the front of the restaurant (hurray!).  The venue is small and clean, and the atmosphere is intimate, perfect for a date or a small gathering. Parisa also invites its guests to bring their own wine, so make sure to stop by the SAQ on your way there if you are thirsty!  The food there is simply delicious; the lentil soup was to die for and the Shrin Polo a splendid blend of flavors! The saffron rice accompanying the main dish featured berries, nuts and raisins, and was no less than an arrangement of sweet and salty merged in perfect harmony. When that delicious food reached my mouth that night, I fell in love. (I hope my husband won't mind it...)  On top of the good food, the service, executed by a respectable young man, was excellent. The ingredients tasted fresh and the kitchen looked clean as well.  Parisa doesn't come cheap ($16-$25 per plate on average) but it's definitely worth every penny. Make sure you make a reservation before showing up to save yourself a spot, especially on weekends.  P.S. Vegetarians rejoice; Parisa has a whole page of its menu dedicated to vegetarian dishes, and all the entrees are vegeterian-friendly as well."}
{"text":"i visited this restaurant the second time i visited Montreal this year and the food is amazing and i cannot explain how amazing it is, i don't understand how any one give it less than five..."}
{"text":"Great fresh food and service. Baghalie is great and Koobideh excellent! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Another so called Persian restaurant , everything is disgusting here.  We were there last sunday. ordered koobide kebab it was like a rubber I swear my knife was having difficulty to cut the koobide, like I said another so called Persian restaurant. In North America Los Angeles is the only place where you can enjoy exceptional Persian food because in Los Angeles there are more then 1,5 million Persians so that's the reason all the Iranian restaurants thrive to do there best to atranct the Persian community ,not like montreal where there are minimal amount Persians ,Iranian restaurants in montreal they dont care about Persians the care about québécois because this people don't know nothing about Persian food so it's easy to satisfy them cuz they don't know what real Persian food is."}
{"text":"As for as Persian goes, Maison de Kebab is far better. While I found the food here was very tasty, I thought it was a bit overpriced for what you got. In contrast to Maison de Kebab, portions here are far smaller.  Their Mirza Ghasemi as well as their Garlic Mushrooms were excellent even if the portions were small.  On the plus side, it is indeed BYOB, and the place was positively packed (granted it was a Saturday night), we were lucky we scored a table. Even then, service was slow and it took forever to receive our food.  I was disappointed."}
{"text":"We were four on April 24/2015. Our second visit. I must say that the food was good but I have a couple of negatives of the way the restaurant operates. À la carte, I ordered the \"Koobideh\" a lamb and beed kebab, very tasty. I wanted to replace the Basmatic rice with crispy french fries, the waitress said that it's an extra $2.75, I said that it's a replacement, the answer is still the same. Since I'm paying the full price for the meal + 2.75, I asked that the rice be put in a container for me to take it home. It was refused. They kept the rice and I was stuck to pay the extra 2.75 for fries. Number 2 - At the end of the meal, we were asked about beverages, three chose the tea, I chose coffee, to my surprise, I was charged $2.25 for the coffee, the tea was included but I was not told about the coffee. Those little things will cost a lot to the owners because we will never go back. We will also spread the word abouth their penny pinching. Watch out."}
