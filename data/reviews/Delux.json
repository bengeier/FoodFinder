{"text":"This place was so cool looking!  Real dark with a moder/futuristic type feel with glowing blue lamps and crazy shaped decorations on the wall.  The Deluxe Burger was great and you get french fries in this little shopping car.  We got the 1/2 sweet potato 1/2 regular fries... great!  They even serve it with Fancy Sauce (Step Brothers reference.. but true story)!"}
{"text":"the burger was good, not great but oh the service, i think they forgot all about us.   If you are looking to eat in less than an hour forget it!"}
{"text":"Great place for those who are eating carb-free (low carb), got the Delux Burger with a lettuce wrap, and the tomato salad as my side."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and service. I got the beet salad and mixed fries. The salad was enormous. Easily good for two. I would have preferred less dressing is my only complaint. I've been here numerous times. Last time I got the veggie sandwich which was delicious. I'm a vegetarian but everyone else ordered burgers and enjoyed their meals. If you go you HAVE to order the sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"Great burger but I happen to love blue cheese.  Their panini's are awesome and even though I am not a vegetarian I still adore the veggie panini.   Sweet potato fries are amazing here.  especially with the aioli sauce. Bartenders remember me and the managers always come over to say Hi and make sure everything was alright. Love the candles everywhere cuz who doesn't look great in dim lighting?! Bathroom is always super clean and it's retro look is neat.  Some of the patrons can be a little stuffy but they are easily ignored."}
{"text":"The food was amazing, I had the breakfast sandwich. I'll come back just to get this again. The service, though, was really bad. The waiter never stopped by and the food took forever."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the place it smelled delicious! We were greeted nicely buy host who was very accommodating. We started with the freshest doughnuts that were still hot when they served omg yummy. Had for the first time the mango mimosa's they were good. Then we share the French on egg bread which was to die for. I had the Breakfast sandwich served on the freshest bun. My friend had the Duck confit and said  that it was flavorful and definitely recommended. The ambiance was warm and inviting with a cool city vibe."}
{"text":"This place has the best burgers and sushi I've ever tasted!!!!! And the staff is VERY friendly! Especially our server James& the other girl whose name I forgot to spell but starts with a L. They're awesome."}
{"text":"Great.   Had the Cubano, the pulled pork, the chicken sandwich and the rice and beans. All amazing. Great coffee as well.   A little on the pricey side, but they care, and caring isn't free (check my other reviews for the places that charge less and don't give a s***)  Oh and the manager has a peanut allergy so my fellow allergists should be safe (ask anyway of course)"}
{"text":"Great sushi!!! Quality and their reverse happy hour specials can't be beat. Love the whole look of the place. Really good beers on tap too! Perfect place if you take someone that doesn't like raw fish because they have delicious burgers! However I'm stickn to their late night happy hour sushi!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for late night dinner or hang out. We had sushi and it was pretty good. People we're still coming in here at 1am on a Sunday night. The sweet potato fries were amazing. We would come here again."}
{"text":"Good and fairly priced! Opened late was the key."}
{"text":"Delux has expanded their menu as well as added sushi to their repertoire. And can I just say, \"Holy hell there were a lot of menus that got dropped down on our little two top of a table\" lol.   I tried their Samba roll; it was alright, nothing to write home about. The Vegas room was okay - it was a standard Vegas roll. The fries, the one thing I remember being awesome at the place was alright. Maybe I built it up in my mind and it didn't live up to the hype or perhaps it really wasn't super awesome as I once thought it was. The lobster bisque was good. Didn't have that finish that Wild Fish had, but it was still pretty good. I really appreciate that they have local brews available cause who doesn't love Papago's Orange blossom?   Now onto dessert - had a sample of their some pie and their peanut butter cookie which was chewy but not like undercooked or anything. It was a good finish rather than a full dessert. Topped with ice cream was just extra yummy. The apple pie was okay, but you really need the ice cream to combat the top of the pie. The crust under the filling, which has all the yummy flavorful goodness is better and not so dry. Both desserts are a good size and perfectly capable of being split between two people.  I'd come here again and give the sushi more of a chance cause I do love the burgers here."}
{"text":"The food was OK, most uncomfortable seats ever! The blue lights are cool and I love the Lil fries carts. bUT this place is way waaaaaay over priced for what it is."}
{"text":"What's there not to love? The Delux burger is one of the best in town, and their fries and aloli are amazing. The wait staff is wonderful and attentive, even on a busy night. Big fan, although I can't say I've ever tried anything but the Delux burger (it's that good!)"}
{"text":"So glad this place is open late! Been here almost every time I drive in from Los Angeles late. Amazing sweet potato fries, great burgers, and I can even get a sushi roll to boot!"}
{"text":"Delux is always a good choice for a burger and a beer.  The hosts, servers, and bartenders are all very helpful, hip and seemingly all cool.  The real draw for me is the 25+ eclectic craft and micro brews on tap.  You can try some great Belgian style brews as well as eccentric American craft lagers and ales.  Good stuff for sure and if you are OK with a wait, Delux is a great burger and beer spot."}
{"text":"I've heard people love or hate the burgers here, kind of weird, I wouldn't know cuz I don't eat beef. But they have some excellent vegetarian options- my favs include the caprese, veggie panini and the beet salad. And of course the fries. Excellent drink selection as well. It's hard to leave this place without a huge tab though :("}
{"text":"Can't speak to the ambiance as I got my food to go, but my Chinese chicken salad was fantastic.  I was working late and picked up the food.  Went back to work and the salad even sat out for an hour before I got to it, but it didn't matter.  It was amazing.  I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"So after hearing good things for a while, I finally got a chance to check out Delux last night and I had to put my two cents in.   It was a Friday, so I expected a bit of a wait, but the wait wasn't as bad as I thought it might be, especially since we decided to wait for an indoor table. I was excited that we were seated at the blue-lit center table - the only negative is the stools become very uncomfortable after some time, but everything else more than made up for it.  I was pretty impressed overall. Friendly service, cool atmosphere and really good food - and I definitely felt like we got our money's worth. I ordered a dirty martini that was really more like two, since they left the shaker with me. Both their regular and sweet potato fries are really good, with a great dipping sauce. I decided I had to go for the delux burger - and for $9.50 you get a lot of burger, not only in size but also in flavor. It's smothered in maytag and gruyere cheese and caramelized onions and I love the bread they use for the bun. Oh and I love how they recommend it cooked medium-rare - perfect.  I didn't have beer this time, but I'll definitely go back for the beer selection. It was very exciting to see how many they had on tap for such a small restaurant.   Due to it's smaller size, it's probably not a great place for a big group, but if you have just a few people, it's a fun place and you definitely you get your money's worth. Oh and did I mention they serve food till 2 a.m., everyday? That's amazing for Phoenix. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was so completely ready to love Delux. I had been waiting to try it for a reaaaaally lonnnng time, and was excited to make the little trek down Camelback and give it a go. Pre-review context: it was a Friday night, and it was very busy.   My boyfriend and I rolled up into the strip mall parking lot, and spent a solid 5 minutes hunting for a space. And not just, you know, driving around looking for one. I mean competitive space hunting. Horns were honked. I became a little afraid. An ulcer was formed. After finding a spot some distance away, we walked up and in to the trendy, blue darkness of the restaurant.   The whole place was almost completely full, including the outside patio area, (which is where I really would've liked to sit - October, you are finally HERE!). But I wasn't mad at 'em. Good for them. A frosty hostess seated us at the bar-style table in the center of the restaurant, and stalked away. I think we interrupted her composition of a text message. Whatever, lady!   The table we sat at is probably exactly the place I would've LEAST liked to sit. While it is, you know, \"cool,\" and lit from beneath by fluorescent blue lights, I felt very cramped in between the parties to our left and right. They weren't being loud, or obnoxious, and I even felt they were being conservative with their elbows. All the same, it was not a comfortable fit. Plus, my man and I prefer to sit next to each other when we go out. I know...I know. We also like to converse during dinner, and, since we could barely hear one another over the din, this would probably be the kind of place I'd go with a group of tipsy friends rather than on a date night.   In contrast to the disgruntled hostess, our server was very sweet and pleasant. She was friendly and patient with us as we made our drink decisions, and also remained unobtrusively attentive for our meal. My boyfriend was excited to see that they had Sierra Nevada on draft; I ordered a French Vanilla martini, which I chumped out on and couldn't finish. This, from a girl who used to order three Long Islands at once...I think my heart cracked a little, to witness myself so far removed from my former glory.   We shared an order of mixed fries, \"a la carte...\" CART, get it? Get it? Very cute presentation, but I think I would've been more tickled if I didn't know it was coming.   Know this: I am a sweet potato fry maniac. In fact, Delux's sweet potato fries were really the big reason I wanted to give it a go. I had anticipated them for months! ...and they were just, okay. In fact, both varieties of fries were \"just, okay,\" and I also didn't really see any reason to rant and rave and Yelp about the ketchup or the aioli, the latter which I feel I make a better version of at home. So, yes. I was happy to munch on some sweet potato fries, but it's not like wings sprouted from my back or anything upon touching the first golden fry to my lips. My boyfriend said they were \"fine,\" which is his stock answer for assessing the quality of anything that isn't a beer or an action movie.   My boyfriend got some random burger, and I had the turkey burger. I agree with the several reviewers that have whined for \"more seasoning, please!\" on the turkey burger. Let's face it - the noble turkey is one bland-ass bird. It requires a heavy hand, a smackdown of spices and seasonings. My turkey burger seemed to get something more akin to a pat on the head, although I did still enjoy it, especially with the creamy sauce that came alongside. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger, but prefers the Original Hamburger Works. Oh, well. Apparently the fancy presentation, (\"what is this stuff?\", was his response to the julienned carrot garnish), wasn't enough to compete with the sheer grunge of OHW.   It was easy to pay our bill and leave. I know people complain about this sometimes - you will not have to complain here.   We will probably go back. I'd like to try one of the \"real\" burgers, and my boyfriend has mentioned the great beer selection several times since our visit. It wasn't a bad experience...it just wasn't all that and a cart of fries."}
{"text":"good for late night eats. Good burger patty but please change the bun already. Too much bread."}
{"text":"Delux has been my favourite regular place now for several months if not a year now.  The place has a beautiful vibe and feel, and my partner and I take family and friends here with confidence. The staff really make the experience, they know how to tell you about the food, what to expect, etc. They've been helpful in picking wines--btw the Hungarian (not sure if it's available still) was a great find.  The steak frites is a favorite. Scallops are beautiful.   Deserts ... the crème brulée is a superlative. Not on the menu any more, but there was an exquisite pastry desert.  Unlike Boehmer across the street, Delux is a little more in tune with the Ossington/Queen W vibe, if I can put it that way. Not trying quite so hard (and by that I don't mean working hard, just, cooler).  Btw.. the bread that comes with every meal is, I believe, house made, and has a beautiful unique texture and flavour."}
{"text":"It was my first time visiting Phoenix (I'm from LA), and I had just paid $10 for a pair of unbelievable Canali (Italian made) jeans at the nearby Last Chance.  That, coupled with drastically cheaper gas I'd just filled my tank with, and you can only imagine the love-for-everything-Phoenix high I was riding as I entered Delux with my native-born girlfriend.  The restaurant was nicely decorated with a slightly modern/upscale feel to it.  The prices were extremely CHEAP. The burger (I put my faith in the Delux burger) was unbelievable.  Truly a treat,  Not to mention their generous portions of fries,  The cart was convenient for rolling back and forth between my girlfriend and I, and it also created the illusion of containing less delicious sweet potato/regular cut fries than it actually did.  Not to mention the great thousand island that was served in a sauce dish along with the burger and its nicely plated garnish.  My girlfriend ordered the Vegetable Panini (after threatening to order a regular green salad for 10 dollars at the burger place she bragged about) at the last minute, and I was irate with her after she continued to ask for bites of my burger and expressed disappointment with her sandwich (which I later thought was pretty good after trying it, but nothing compared to the burger).  The bad part: Our server was absolutely terrible.  Maybe he had something going on in his life, maybe he's just a poor server, but we deserved more attentive service than we received.  It all seemed to stop after our food came, without so much as a water refill.  However, all around great, upscale burgers at good prices.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One of the only places in Phoenix you can consistently get LA quality sushi.  Fresh, high quality ingredients and fantastic late night reverse happy hour. Excellent."}
{"text":"Yanno, if you like your meat overcooked and you like mostly bread and not much meat, and you like slow service, then this is the place for you. Honestly, I'd rather have In-N-Out or even Burger King. Course, Delux's bathrooms are really cool.."}
{"text":"I fucking LOVE this place, ask anyone what my thing is .. And that's rootbeer floats. I'm a rootbeer float enthusiast. And guess what.. THEY BREW IT THEMSELVES! The rootbeer! Oh my fucking float masters of the heavens I was blessed. They have that shit on tap. So dinner CLEARLY was starting off pretty good. I ordered (what the waiter recommended) a grilled cheese panini, basil mozzarella heirloom tomatoes, add bacon and avocado. You have a thing of beauty and did I mention all the fries come in a Barbie size shopping cart?! Fuck yes."}
{"text":"We got in before dinnertime rush prior to our show at the LOT. The service was impeccable here and the decor was quite noteworthy. The ambiance was warm and welcoming.  For our appetizer, we had the fried fish fritters, crispy on the outside and nice cooked on the inside. This was served with a nice mustard/mayo sauce along with capers.   I had the pressed cubano sandwich, The ham/pork with the grainy mustard and gruyere cheese was a prefect combination. The salted plantains were a nice side. My husband had the duck confit. This was quite flavourable. The duck was well cooked with pear, apple and red cabbage. The portion were just right.  We finished off our meals with a nice cuban con leche (cuban espresso with steamed milk)."}
{"text":"Love this place, sushi is delicious, love the lollipop ...burgers and fries delicious..come here from Chandler for sushi...grandkids love the shark t.v. .Staff very nice , place clean."}
{"text":"This place is a great spot on Ossington that my wife and I have gone to for many dates. The menu is always changing, but every time we have been the food has been cooked well and we are always happy people when we leave. How can you not be, after having their made to order warm chocolate chip cookies and milk for desert."}
{"text":"Finally ate at the much talked about Deluxe. What a treat! The fries in the little shopping cart are charming and tasty. The cheeseburger was to die for! Portions are in abundance - more than I could finish. Price wise it was a little high, but without question, worth every penny. Our waitress was prompt, and there wasn't the long wait I've read about in other reviews. This is certainly on our list of places to visit again."}
{"text":"First time here, very welcoming. I love the atmosphere, very clean,  and friend staff. The food was good, not great, but good.i had the delux burger(which was recommended by our server) basket of fries, shrimp tempura toll, California roll, and a spicy tuna roll. The burger was good, cooked to order, not dry, and very filling. The sushi was ok, not too satisfied with it. Overall a good experience, and will be coming back."}
{"text":"Ohhh Delux. This is definitely the spot to cure a hungry stomach. The panini's are pretty incredible and their french fries in their little carts are their best match. Their burgers are equally as awesome, they're not your typical burger joint. This place adds character to their burgers, something that doesn't come around often.  One of the few that is open late (2 AM), which is always a plus, but the only downfall is that it is always crowded whenever I go."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great burgers and the fries are to die for! Jon was our server and was so helpful and charming, it made our experience even better!"}
{"text":"10 years ago, Delux was the spot. Phoenix was less a foodie town, and there were FAR fewer options for burgers around 2005. and so Delux was a place i hit whenever i visited Phx. now that i live here, and i see Delux more often and have gone there a few times over the past couple years, i'm gonna say it's a straight-up middle of the road burger joint with pretty decent parking and seating...but high-ish prices for what you get and a fairly obnoxious noise level inside, sometimes from the servers themselves when they congregate by the order-up area.  THE FOOD ordered a burger well and it was plain BURNT, son! major problems there when you a BURGER joint serving burnt bricks. BOO.  fries were good and dipping aioli and catsup complemented nicely. but holy hell there's A LOT of salt there. i would like more potato flavor and less sodium...but these are probably frozen and not fresh cut and so there ya go.  sandwiches...meh...similar to Crapplebee's or Chili's. big portions of wholesale supermarket ingredients.  dessert - afterthought.  booze selection - good.  shakes - COME ON, all shakes are delicious.  THE SERVICE on a recent visit we had Doug and he was FIVE STARS all day - a true professional doing the best one can in a mediocre environment. again, some of the other servers were loud as all get-out by the pick-up area and that was unpleasant. the noise in Delux is pretty healthy to begin with. i don't need the damn supervisor (hipster dude with glasses) amping it up to 11 with his cackling and joking with his staff: GET BACK TO WORK!  so, depending on who you get, service can be quite great........or dumb.  THE LOCATION hip decor...ACOUSTICS FOR SH*T - sorry but this place is just too LLLOOOUUUDDD if it's even half full. having a bar SO close to the sit-down dining is a bad design, because it makes those tables and chairs ---too close together to start with--- even more claustrophobic.  THE PARKING easy peasy. it's a damn strip mall so boomshackalacka.  PRICES for Applebee's-level food: high. about $25 per person with drinks and $20 per without.   OVERALL Delux burger has peaked. at least half of the service is not properly trained or monitored. the food is meh; the drinks are boppin but the space is too uncomfortable for a long haul. pass. next time i'd rather try Two Hippies, Smash Burger, or a funky Hillstone for that matter."}
{"text":"Ummm I wasn't impressed. The burger was alright (not as tasty as I hoped) and nothing I would go out of my way for. The sweet potato fries were good but again I wouldn't go out of my way for. My coke was mostly carbonated water and I feel it was too pricy for what it was. I'd rather go to In and Out. There was sushi on the menu too so I guess that says something.  It was a lot of food but I didn't want to take it home."}
{"text":"Decent burgers but overpriced. If the fries weren't as good as they are I would have given this place two stars."}
{"text":"Checking out burger joints in Phoenix. Heard about this and read some reviews so thought I'd give this a try. Coming from midwest where we have alot ofgreat food and even better burgers so anxious to see what Delux had to offer. Worked late and missed dinner so came out here late to grab a bite and see if Delux was up to snuff. Didnt seem too crowded midweek. One TV over the bar, plenty of open seating. Had a bar with one long table down the middle. I sat in the bankette. Since it was my first time here, tried the Delux burger first to see how it tastes. Like all my burgers well-done and it was cooked to my taste. Burger was fine. Nothing too impressive but better than a fast food joint so no complaints there. Burger was about $10 and with a drink I got out of there about $15ish or so.   Not the cheapest price I've seen but for burgers of higher quality you have to expect to pay a premium. From what I have heard The Grind and charr are similar pricing so I'll be trying those next. For now, Delus isnt bad. Didnt have too big a meal since it was late but will try the others and see which one gets my repeat business as a newbie in town. So far not bad though."}
{"text":"Raspberry Lambic.   Did you hear me?  Raspberry Lambic?  It's a burger joint with all the class and style of a downtown jazz club located in a strip mall across the street from a gelato shop.  It's a marriage of convenience to an ugly girl who really knows how to work it.    The best things about Delux are its burgers and fries.  The fries, sweet potato and regular, are crisp, salty and delicious.  They are served in miniature shopping carts with the D for Delux emblazoned on the front.  Our server adorably quipped \"Fries A La Cart.\"  Heh...heh....ehhhhh.....they still tasted good.   The burgers are properly cooked to order and the meat is flavorful and satisfying.   I've been twice now and have yet to be disappointed.   My only beef (pun intended) with Delux is the lack of 1000 island dressing for my burger (I'm white trash like that).   However, the aioli which is spicy but still smooth makes up for the lack of 1000 as a substitute condiment.     The beer list is extensive and the menus are adorable.  The outside patio is misted and looks out onto a nice view...well, for a road-side strip mall at least.  If you go during peak hours, expect a wait.   It's reasonably priced but still a $15/head trip."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Delux. I went on a Wednesday evening for dinner. The place has a cool vibe - very Queen West. The place is quite small - if you're not sitting in a booth (which there were only 3 or 4), then the tables they have are literally 1 foot away from each other. If you're fine with getting cozy with your neighbours, then try this place out.  We started off with the Charcuterie plate for starters. $20 for a large (recommended for 2 people) and the pates and cured meats were delicious. The toasted bread that came with it were perfectly crisp on the outside and slightly soft on the inside. It was a lot of food for 2 people, and it only came with 8 small triangles of bread, so there was a lot of meat left over.  I had the pressed Cubano sandwich for $15. The smoked meat was moist and flavourful and the chipotle mayo and grainy mustard was delicious and really added that extra oomph. It came with fried plantain chips (or maybe bananas, I'm not sure).   My friend had the pork belly (lots of fat on the cut of meat they give you). I can't comment on how it tasted, but he said it was delicious.   Service was great - our server was very informative about the menu items. They were very attentive and prompt on refilling my glass of water, especially since they had to do it about 6-7 times (I drink a lot).  Although I do think the items are bit on the pricier side, I would return again."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever. They're not of the typical bar-food burger to chow down on variety, but ones that you want to savor, loving every gueyere-covered bite. Just when you think it couldn't get better come along their fries. I could eat three orders of them. They come in a cute little mini-shopping cart. Delux offers regular fries and sweet potato fries, which are a must if you go there. I always order a combo of the two to dip in their spicy aioli sauce. My boyfriend has made this our official weeknight date spot. It's casual enough to stop by after work but has a vibe that definitley makes it \"date-worthy.\" I've always had great service, and have seen the owner strolling around several times. All-around great place to stop by when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am not a big meat eater so I either get the Grilled Chicken Panini or the Chinese Chicken Salad.  You cant go wrong with their Sweet Potato Fries either!  This place is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix.  I've never had a bad experience at Delux.  Great milkshakes too :]"}
{"text":"I can't believe I've failed to review this place! In fact, I'm not sure why I don't go more often. Had a nice lunch today, the burger at medium rare was super juicy and the fries were solid. I had a really nice bloody mary and the $3 price tag was nice. I want to stray away from the burgers and try some sandwiches next time... plus the wall o' draft beers is drool inducing."}
{"text":"Ah delux you little fancy hamburger joint, that must have a corporate account at Ikea or something because that place is chalk full of swedish furniture. Any how this place is pretty fun, its open till 2 in the morn which is a big plus in my book, the tap beer is extensive but in a beer snob way its kinda boring. It reminds me of the fathers office, I'm sure they ripped the shopping cart thing from them but its all gravy if you like fancy burgers at 2 in the morn than go getcha some son."}
{"text":"Forgot I went here in the summer. Had two dishes.  Duck confit picadillo hash: The hash needed more duck. I shouldn't have to search my plate for it. There were a small amount of fresh veggies on the side of the plate that felt like an afterthought. They didn't ask me how I wanted my eggs and they overcooked the sunny side up ones they gave me by a bit. Tostones felt overly oily. Just a lot of meh.  Donuts: Love the presentation in terms of having them in a bag marked Donuts. They didn't really wow me with their taste though. Felt overly thick, and kind of just reminded me of Timbits if they were baked fresh. Just a one note flavour of cinnamon.They came with some chantilly cream (I heard before that they came with both cream and dulche de leche, so I was disappointed by the lack of it).  In principle, while I'm all for complaining when something goes wrong, I just wasn't feeling it at all so I didn't do anything about it. Maybe I just had a bad day. It can happen. I'm just not going to take my chances on it again."}
{"text":"The hostess sat me at the sushi bar although I told her I wasn't gonna eat sushi. But the sushi chef invited me to try their sushi and I'm glad he did! The sushi was amazing I think it was one of the best sushi rices I've ever had at a sushi place, salmon was delicious as well. Best thing was the sushi chef, although he said he was knew he seemed very knowledgeable and was charming and very polite. Definitely coming back to see him."}
{"text":"Been here 3 - 4 times? (I come in for quick bites), yes, 3, tried lunch, brunch, dinner.  The first bit is the food's fine, ya know, pretty good, no real complaints, but the service is outstanding for the insecurity and pretentiousness and self-absorption.  FOOD  Cubano sandwich, not bad, the Fed does it better.  Donuts (supposedly among top 10) was OK, simple, served with bit of coffee/espresso?, cookies (meh, had way better in many places), other stuff were all equally fine, the quality is not gonna make ya regret the bill in the end.  SERVICE  Oh, yea, I remember because it happened every time, girl, guy, guy, the checking the book routine when the restaurant is freakiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnnnnnnn empty (I usu head over when just open), the sigh, the hesitation, the brooding, the pause as he/she considers if it's possible for me to be squeezed into the an empty restaurant at 6 pm, same done when couple arrived after me, for god's sake ya just check that book, did 10 new reservations in the minute or two in between?    Don't like that I have to get your attention when the resto empty, can see that you're just lounging and chitchatting (and there are two of you).  Survey the room, crying out loud, two freakin tables, yes, we're all ready to order.  Another time, didn't bring the coffee with donuts (\"Oh it's coming,\" says he, with wrinkling of nose), like it's supposed to come after the donuts are served.  The same with the milk (\"Oh, would you like some?  I can get you some.).  It's just Sealtest 2%, the same they use for coffee.    Then ya got the Concordia/Monreal-uni guy, tall, lanky, bit more attentive, but he's gotta lean in and whisper the French bon mots pour moi comme c'est un secret entre nous ... yeeeeeeeeeeeeeesh ... pretentious ... put-on.  Just make eye contract, keep the upward gesturing of hand into blossoming flower down, smile, and speak French without puckering up.  Stop hiring your friends' kids, hire good, focused, attentive help, without the character actor potential.  Everyone, look at the dining room, look at your customers and wait on them ... by waiting and looking to see when you're needed.    Goshdarn kids.  What?  First real job?"}
{"text":"besides the old fav of most AZ/88, Delux is one of the best burgers in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. in a strip mall with Gelato Spot, Zen/32 and the huge Safeway, it's found it's niche for hip. not many restaurants are beyond the strip center/mall in AZ, but you have to go inside to see if the spot is for you.   i have been going to Delux for a few years now since it opened and have always had good food there. and the major PLUS here is the GINORMO selection of brews that they have - probably about 20+ on tap and seasonal brews as well. the shopping cart with regular or sweet potato fries or a mix of both was cute at first, but now i'm over it.  what i order: - the beet salad (note: not just beets, there is lettuce in there too) - the standard burger either a lettuce wrap or the normal way (really if you're trying to cut down on bread, the lettuce wrap is pretty damn good) - mix of fries, although compared to my fav restaurant in chicago Rockit's sweet potato fries, Delux's are a little soggy and limp like that guy from 'revenge of the nerds' trying to throw a football  it's a cool spot and is open LATE NIGHT...big plus and hard to find in this area (note: the place is small, seating is tight, but there is outdoor seating as well)"}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said a dozen times? Sweet potato fries -- delicious. Aioli - worth every  calorie.   I had the Delux burger and though I would have liked a bit more bleu cheese, it was a damn good burger. You might get the same result at home, but only if you have time to grind your own beef and grow your own arugula.   I tried the Papago Orange Blossom beer...not bad, but soft; it was a bit too similar to what the eight year olds are selling at the lemonade stand down the street from my house.  Finally, the restrooms were clean and candle-lit. It's the kind of restroom you'd see in one of those late-night, Showtime movies.   I'll go back to Delux in a month or two, but I'll probably order from the to-go menu rather than pulling up a stool."}
{"text":"I'm still looking for a GREAT burger.  I cant find one.  Ill review ZinBurger next.    This place is okay.  The fries are good, burger is good...  I'm just looking to be WOWed.  Also... The burgers didnt have many options.   No list of anything fancy or unexpected.  Just a pretty standard burger.   Oh but the fries are served in a mini shopping cart, so thats just sooooo cool, that it makes up for everything else being just so-so...    Wait, no... my mistake... the fries delivery system doth not make up for an otherwise Meh experience.   NEEEEEEXT!"}
{"text":"I like Delux. The burgers are good, no doubt, but my absolute favorite there are the sweet potato fries. I hear the salads are not bad either but regardless of any good intentions of trying something new the next time I go I cannot get away from the old staples.  As far as ambiance, I find the inside a bit loud and the patio basically has views of the parking lot. But again, overall not bad."}
{"text":"While I'm not usually a fan of the trendy (and this place is trendy), I enjoyed the food here.  This comes with the caveat: You have to be willing to spend.  We had a salad topped with beets and carrots and some other goodies with a divine balsamic vin. dressing, weird to say the but way the beets and carrots were shredded made the dressing to \"stuff\" ratio really great.  We then shared some sweet potato fries and normal fries, good, but just fries.  I'm a sucker for a loaded burger that isn't cooked to death and that's what I got here.  There were other aspects of the place I wasn't able to sample (the beer journeys, for one thing...being pregnant has it's downfalls), they had some really interesting beer picks up there, I was salivating just at the thought of some of them.  If you have a taste for something more than Bud, Miller or the usual watery junk you should check this place out just for thier selection of craft beers."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. Fantastic, flavorful, juicy burgers but my favorite thing is their fries. They do regular and sweet potato fries (brought out in little shopping carts) and both are amazing - skinny, crispy, not at all greasy - they come with ketchup and another awesome dipping sauce. I've also had the fish sandwich and a salad here, and they were just as high quality and wonderful as their burgers and fries. Shakes are good here, too. They have a very small space, so expect to wait unless you want to sit at the communal table or outside (in which case you still might wait). However, it's a very nice atmosphere, with casual vibe and good music. I only deduct a point because service was so-so on my last visit, and the restaurant smelled like a nursing home for some reason."}
{"text":"Try the veggie panini! Also the reverse happy hour is awesome and they have great servers here as well!"}
{"text":"Delux seemed a little yuppie for me, but we tried it anyways after my friend kept raving about it. I got the original Delux burger with the caramelized onions and whatnot on it. I liked the soft baguette it came on; but at the same time when I want a burger I want a BURGER, you know? So one of those oversized buns would have been better, I think. We shared an order of the sweet potato and regular fries, which were good with that aoili dip that comes with it. They were crispy and thin cut, which I liked.   I was disappointed with their small selection of burgers. I like variety. But they did offer salads (the chinese chicken salad, by the way, is great) and I think a few other items. On the plus side, they're open to 2am... and they have cool bathrooms if that counts for anything."}
{"text":"Delux is overrated. I've had a better burger at Red Robin. Seriously, Fez has better Fez Burgers and Sweet Potato fries.  I won't be back here. It's just overrated and frankly boring.  My mom's burgers are better than this place."}
{"text":"I came here with one friend and it was a great experience. I only had a california roll, it was perfectly fine, and my friend had a burger which he loved. The best part of the restaurant is by far the service staff. They were talkative, friendly, and really made me enjoy eating more.   Douglas was my waiter, and he was phenomenal. Whatever he is getting paid, he deserves more. He was very nice, attentive, happy, and quick. He completely made the dining experience for me."}
{"text":"I am really impressed with this restaurant/bar.  I got the delux burger which was very flavorful, although the bread was a little too dense.  The sweet potato fries, served in a mini shopping cart, are awesome - a must have.  They have a great selection of beer, including my favorite framboise lambic.  The beer flights might be an interesting choice for my next visit.  The decor is nice with soothing blue lighting.  Be aware of the close sitting quarters.  I wasn't sure about the communal counter in the middle of the restaurant, but it turned out to be pretty good.  I was still able to have a decent conversation with my friend without feeling like someone else is listening to us or like I am intruding on another conversation.  Overall, a great place that I will visit again.  Especially since it is open late."}
{"text":"Delux serves an OK  burger. For the price you pay, I've had much better. Just go to In N Out for your burger fix. It's better and cheaper. I'm not sure where people say this burger is phenomenal. Anything usually tastes good with a lot of butter/oil and bacon, which are one of two main ingredients of the Delux Burger after the beef.   But, other than that, the food here is marginal. The Chinese Chicken Salad was horrible (chicken wasn't cooked), fish sandwich was bland, and the grilled chicken sandwich was less tasty than McDonald's McGrilled Chicken.    They have a decent selection of beers; however, the waitresses were slow with drinks and water. I would go to Four Peaks any day as the food is better and the drinks are cheaper. For burgers, save your money and go to In N Out. Although, Chelsea's Kitchen has a pretty decent burger (pricey as Delux though)  I think people in Phoenix haven't had good food before, don't know what good food it, or clueless. Still not sure why people rave about these burgers."}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant as a college student, they gave me a kids menu. I ordered the caprese panini and it was average. I've had much much better."}
{"text":"I lunched at Delux for the first time today...I liked the vibe in there! Some were there for business, some were casual and some were with their families.   My boss and I split a basket of mixed fries (I dig the little shopping cart baskets). The fries weren't outstanding but I appreciated having 2 dipping options - ketchup v. aioli. He had the regular burger, which was devoured in a matter of minutes. I had the turkey burger wrapped in lettuce - it was the most flavorful turkey burger I've ever had! I covered it with the avocado and fresh salsa that accompanied it on the side.   Overall it was a good lunch! I always appreciate a restaurant with good burgers and an open kitchen."}
{"text":"The line is there because the burgers are excellent. You must go here for burgers and fries. It's great! And the delux are good, too! Get the fair delux."}
{"text":"Had the Delux burger and shared some sweet potato and regular fries. Food wasn't mindblowing, but decent.  Atmosphere is pretty cool for the strip mall location and service was pretty good. Overall, a good experience and I would probably return if I were in town again."}
{"text":"When I die, I would like to be buried with the Delux Burger, Fries (please don't forget the aioli) and a yummy IPA fresh from the tap.   The Delux Burger brings you a little closer to heaven. Cooked and seasoned to perfection. Topped with a guyere and blue cheese mixture, coupled with sauteed onions and arugula. All on a brioche bun. The ingredients are super fresh and the meat is all grain-fed. Mommy daddy this thing is a symphony in my mouth!   Then add this lovely burger into an equation of a massive beer list. Not your usual Crud Light but lovely Microbrews. AND good prices? AND they are open until 2am 7 days a week?!? Not to mention that the service was outstanding?  I'm floating on a cloud. Please don't get me down. The taste of Delux Burger and Sunbru is lingering in my mouth. What's that? I'm slipping! The Burger is weighing me down. Falling. NO! Back to reality. Damn.  I contemplated ordering another Burger to get that moment back...I guess I will have to come back tomorrow..."}
{"text":"The Delux burger is huge! I shared it with a friend and still couldn't eat it all. And the basket\" of fries was a hoot! I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I used to love it here. For years it was the best burger in town. But, I have to say the last couple times we've been here I've been really disappointed. The burger is BLAND now. I have to take this place off the list, too bad. Houston's/Hillstone burger has never disappointed, so we'll be going there from now on."}
{"text":"Barney's this place is not. If you've become accustomed to the creative variety of burgers at that small Bay Area chain, Delux will be somewhat of a disappointment. Like others have mentioned, this place is loud, busy and pricey, but still manages to produce a decent dinner experience.  A recent 6:30 Friday evening visit had our party of four waiting for only about 10 minutes before we were seated at the long, narrow community table in the center of the restaurant. Not a bad wait, I'd say. The service was efficient, but friends she certainly did not want to make. Nevertheless, we ordered drinks, fries and burgers and tried to pass the time by talking above, through and around the noise. We were fairly unsuccessful. My qualm came with the bill.  The Standard burger is a whopping $9 and the separate basket of fries is an additional $5. That means a burger and split order of fries rings up at a very San Francisco-like $11.50. Yikes! A joint in a strip mall in Phoenix leaves a bit to be desired when contemplating an $11.50 burger. For about the same price, a diner can get a trip to Chelsea's Kitchen up the road. Both have good burgers and Sierra Nevada. One just does it a little better than the other."}
{"text":"Went here for a team lunch after some of us saw it on CheckPlease AZ (PBA Show)  It looked really good so we gave it a shot.  I had the Original Cheese Burger cooked medium rare and it was cooked perfect.  It was very juicy and had amazing flavor.  I also had a half mixed order of french fries and sweet potato fries.  All was very good but when I go back I will probably just to the sweet potato fries instead of the mix.  I felt very full after and had to make sure to eat a very small dinner to compensate."}
{"text":"Always been a fan of Delux; however it appears that over time and the addition of the 2go feature, has taken it all down a notch. Decided to order carry out on the way home with our 3 year old. Easy parking and the main restaurant was mildly busy for 8pm on a Friday night. Arrived and the cashier provided our 3 year old with a child's coloring page that included the kids menu. What was annoying was not offering crayons to go with it, and then after asking for some, told \"you can get them at the hostess stand in the restaurant\". What? She did finally bring crayons to us, but 10 minutes later. How about keeping those crayons at the 2go cashier as well? Hmmmm....I digress. Ordering and wait time was good (about 20 minutes total). Items were packed well and provided in plastic bags; NOTE to Delux: paper bags are better as when you pick up a plastic bag filled with take out, everything gathers towards the middle and the food inside the containers slides to one side. This can turn into a mess. Kids peanut butter/jelly sandwich was non-descrip; dark bread and soggy fries  Back to the above note on bagging, had paper been used, the french fries would stay where they belong vs using the plastic bags and the fries spilling into the melted peanut butter from the sandwich. Kind of gross. Main burgers (had both the standard and delux) were as good as I remember. However, fries are thrown in a double paper bag; 5 minutes after picking up the meal, fries (both sweet potato and regular) were a greasy clump of nothing. Tossed them both. I'm all about supporting our local businesses in the Arcadia/Biltmore area, but when something starts to slip, I'll run elsewhere. May dine again in the main restaurant , but no more 2go. They just don't have the service level nor take-out best practices to make it worth the time/money."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the Valley! The service here is always excellent, no matter who our waiter is. The food is very high quality. I often find myself here for an impromptu girl's night out, and the ambiance is just fantastic. Plus, they're open late, which is great for those late night cravings! I crave their French fries probably three times a week, they are THAT good. And the aioli sauce that they serve with the fries tastes so amazing, I have never been able to find another aioli even remotely close to being as good as that. Great ... now I'm craving them again! :)"}
{"text":"I love fries, and their sweet potato are some of the finest fries around.  Also, the burgers are pretty good, but that aole sauce that comes out with the fries along with ketchup is a winner.  I had the turkey burger and I usually get that because of the perfect blend of stuff to have on top a burger.    The only complaint I have is the place is to small.  Its really not good for a group more than four people and even that might be to many.  It just feels cramped inside and I have not sat outside yet.  The actual bar is alright, but I will go back for the fries.  Recommendation:  For people that like a hip scene and love sweet potato fries definitely go, If you are in a big group or claustrophobic do not."}
{"text":"Delux has been on our brunch list for a while. If I had known how amazing their brunch was, I would have made an effort to drop by sooner!   What we tried:  Donuts ($5) - These little buttermilk donuts were coated with cinnamon sugar and had a nice crisp outside with a dense, moist interior. They also came with a side of dulce de leche Chantilly cream which paired perfectly with the donuts. A must order!  Duck Confit Picadillo Hash ($12) - with tostones and two sunny side up eggs. This dish certainly lived up to all the hype! The hash consisted of red peppers, raisins, capers, olives, chunky potatoes and of course, pieces of duck confit. The combination of the flavours went together perfectly. I particularly liked the addition of the raisins which added a nice bit of sweetness to the dish.   Pressed Cubano Sandwich ($10) - cheese, slices of pork, ham, cornichons and grainy mustard. It pretty much looked like a grilled cheese with ham in it and the price was a little on the high side given that it didn't come with any sides, but boy did it taste amazing. A fantastic sandwich!   A perfect brunch!"}
{"text":"I love their beat salad and fries seriously yum what is that amazing sauce and the root beer on tap mmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Tasty crazy good burgers and even a deluxe hot dog! Their chicken salad has celery seed and red grapes in it, and if you've never tried that combination, you've never had chicken salad. I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries, and Delux does great sweet potato fries. The house aioli is great, I recommend the mixed basket of sweet potato and regular fries. If you still have room after that, get the float made with the stout. Happy Hour's good, everything's good!"}
{"text":"Nice looking place, but boring food.  We had the \"cuban sandwich\"....which is a favorite of mine at many cuban restos...but wow, $15 for grilled cheese and ham (nothing more than that, trust me...you can do a lot more than what was offered) is ridiculous....I would pay $15 for something special, THIS WAS NOT SPECIAL.  The duck confit was good, but hard to screw that up....sorry, many better restos on the ossington strip than this. Nice servers, very friendly, but meh on the food...I would not go back."}
{"text":"This review is based on the Grilled Chicken Panini Sandwich.  I was out in Phoenix for work one week so I called up a friend in the area and met up for dinner here.  I like to research restaurants on Yelp when I go out on my trips so naturally I found Delux.  The interior had this modern look - almost like a lounge rather than a restaurant.  We decided to sit outside because it seemed too crowded inside where you don't really have a table and just sit at a long counter next to other people.  I already had a burger for lunch that day, so I didn't want to get another burger.  I got the chicken panini instead - big mistake.  It was dry and tastless.  Nothing much else to say about it.  My friend had the burger which he claims was very good.  They did have a good selection of beers though.  If I'm ever out here again I'll definitely stop by again and try the BURGER Instead."}
{"text":"Still the best burgers and fries around, and a great selection of beers on tap. Zinburger isn't even close."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times and each time I've gotten great service from the staff. I'm not sure how they choose their people but they are always friendly and attentive.  Most of the food is pretty good. Their signature burger is good but needs a little ketchup. I've also had the Grilled Chicken Panini which was ok but not great. It just seemed a little bland. The bread that they use is always really good. I love their sweet potato fries and would get it all the time if it wasn't for my expanding waistline. The best thing I've had their is their Chinese Chicken Salad. The serving size is a little ridiculous because it really is made for two people but it comes in one giant serving bowl. Despite the size, it really is delicious. It has the right amount of tang from the dressing and savoriness from the chicken that makes this carnivore skip the burgers and order the salad.  The one drawback about this place is that it's really small. The outdoor patio area is much more comfortable in terms of elbow space but you're sitting on cheap plastic chairs. Inside you'll be lucky if you're not elbow to elbow with the patron next to you.  Love going to this place when the temperature is nice outside and having a convenient low-key dinner, a middle ground between fast food and fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in phoenix. Love the sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"I created a Yelp account to give this review to Delux. I consider myself a regular as I frequent here about once a week, and I live about 45 minutes away. This is a testament to how wonderful the establishment is. I don't really do reviews but I'll give it a go anyhow.  Food: Top notch. My favorite place to eat hands down. Get the Delux burger. It is 10/10. Read the other reviews for sexy adjectives on what is included with the burger. Sweet potato fries...Christ in heaven I love them. I will not eat them from anywhere else anymore, they simply don't measure up to the ones served here! Their shakes are out of this world, Haagen-Daaz I believe. I have recently started branching out from just the Delux burger. I rarely go alone and with friends I will order the grilled vegetable panini - OMG! Thunderstorm of flavors in your mouth, just fantastic! From what I see and hear they have quite a large variety of beers on tap - one I am eager to try is the Papago Orange Blossom, looks ace.  Atmosphere: For me, it is wonderful. Small, intimate yet loud, great vibe, chill music, all around fun. Almost club/lounge-esque.   Service: One of the reasons I come so frequently. I have had three stand out servers here that I LOVE. First, I believe her name was Stacy. She was in training when she waited on me, and gave me the best service I have ever received at any restaurant. Second, Alejandro. Very nice kid and down to earth, no bs-ing or fake smiling for a tip. Talks to you like a fellow human not paycheck. Third, I believe her name is Amanda. Funny, alert, observative. Never had bad service here from what I can remember, but these waiters/waitresses stand out in particular.  10/10, my favorite place bar none."}
{"text":"Delux is one of my top 5 places in Phoenix. Love the Delux burger, the sweet potato fries and Hagaan Daaz ice cream shakes!"}
{"text":"Okay so Delux needs to revoke whatever ill-conceived licensing agreement they entered into with the cretins over at the airport. That \"Delux\" burger--if you can even call that wretched mass a burger--was the absolute worst single thing I have ever consumed in my whole entire life. The free burgers they give you at this boat-shaped strip club in south Tucson on Fridays far exceeded the \"Delux\" burger in both quality and taste.   The real Delux burger is quite good. In fact, its one of my favorites. So, when I sunk my unwitting teeth into this sham and discovered it's pre-frozen mass-produced patties, cheap-ass American cheese, McDonald's tomatoes, stale \"Brioche\" bun, and conspicuous lack of a tasty condiment capable of masking the mess, you can probably imagine my soul-crushing disappointment.   This thing costs like $14, which is more expensive than a real Delux burger if I recall. I'll never see my poor $14 again. My poor $14 is now in the hands of some godless heathen who's probably reinvesting it to buy licenses from other unsuspecting local business owners. I should be reimbursed that $14 to pay for the colon cleanse I'm gonna need in an hour. My sad, sad anus...   This experience, suffice it to say, has taught me that there is no justice in this world. What's happening over here at Sky Harbor needs to stop ASAP. I am posting this to the actual Delux page to raise awareness, and politely urge the owners of Delux to put this to an end."}
{"text":"I ate the empanada, Marni had the duck confit hash - both were solid, but the service was soooo slow and even though the waitress tried to kinda be friendly, she was a complete moron. But yeah, good food, shitty experience."}
{"text":"Delux shouldn't have a menu.  Sure, some people like the classic burger with cheddar. Or some get a turkey burger. Or maybe a salad. But that's just silly, even though those are great, too. Some people even like their burgers a particular way: with ketchup, with two strips of bacon, with mustard... whatever. I'm one of those people.  But at Delux, you just have to throw yourself into the arms of the attractive waitresses and get what they recommend: the Delux burger medium rare. It's heavenly. And don't forget the basket of mixed fries (sweet potato/regular). Not only does it come out in a little basket, but it also comes out before your burgers. That annoys some, but just embrace being able to nibble on them before the medium rare Delux burger comes out (that is what you ordered, right?).  Plus, they have a killer drink list for a leisurely Friday lunch."}
{"text":"Great food and service. The donuts are deadly good! The price is about right, and would come here again."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Sometimes a little noisy.  Sometimes a wait.   I pretty much always get a lettuce wrap cheeseburger, their bread is too big AND sweet potato fries!  I love how the fries come out in little shopping carts.    It was the first restaurant I had been too after living in NYC that reminded me of NYC!  That was one of reasons we kept going back.  And now they have cupcakes too!  Or just head across the street for gelato!"}
{"text":"Yes the burgers are pretty good... but they suck in comparison to Zinburger down the street. The service is hit or miss. The last time we were there the waitress argued with my bf and told her his burger was cooked right when he sent it back... he ordered medium rare and it was black. She brought another one out but still charged us for it on the bill, so we had to get that fixed.  Overall the experience was just OK."}
{"text":"While the food was good, the service was horrible. It took the coked out servers (yes, that's servers plural) 20 minutes to make eye contact and then they stumbled around in a daze. They were nice but fucked. The food was pretty decent, so after awhile I got over being mad at the lame staff and enjoyed the company i was with The inside of Deluxe is pretty cool and it does have a nice feel to it (very small but comfortable). This review is from late 2010 (was sitting in my drafts folder for a year), so maybe the 3 servers i had are in re-hab and things have improved - I hope so as i do think the place has awesome potential and a decent chef"}
{"text":"Delux rocks. Good service, a full bar, great menu and its open late! if your feel'n not so much like a burger, get the Chinese Chicken Salad or the Grilled Cheese!   ........And don't forget about the root beer on tap!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice. I see no reason to return. The food is good but the toppings on the burgers are skimpy. Thought the first time might have been an off day but second time was the same. Fries are good but at $6, they are way overpriced and should come with the $11 plus burgers. There are much better burgers out there for less money."}
{"text":"Had delicious brunch there today with husband and baby. They were able to accommodate our stroller which was great. The Cuban breakfast and duck confit hash were both awesome! I really liked the raisins and potatoes in the hash. The bite of roast pork I had was very flavorful. Would definitely go more often!"}
{"text":"\"Ode to the salad\" Two words: In-vogue.  Delectable burgers, Exceptional Salad... When you think Burger, the first thing that comes to mind is a hands-on, unpolished, All-American type of fare. Delux is the sheik fashionista of the burger world.   Excellent brew selection: \"beer flights\" are amazing.   You can't go wrong with a Delux Burger, but that isn't what keeps me coming back folks. Are you ready for this? SALAD. That's right, salad.  You're probably thinking, \"Wow this guy gets a salad at a burger joint\" but I ensure you, The DELUX CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD will change your life. It reduced me to a confused, pathetic, blubbering oaf for days, maybe weeks until I returned for another. If you must have a burger, PLEASE, do yourself a favor and get the Chinese chicken salad on the side (but be warned, its siren call can tame the most pompous of meat loving men.)  And remember to get a basket of \"MIXED FRIES\", that way; you can try both the sweet potato and regular. Together, they're an unstoppable force of dynamic excellence. One of my favorite late night dinner stops. Eat well, Live well, and surround yourselves with ones who do. - Cheers"}
{"text":"My boyfriend just reviewed this place and although we have never  been here together - I thought that I might chime in as well. I really enjoyed this little burger place.  It makes eating a burger seem fancy in a very modern setting.  I really LIKE the sweet potato french fries....Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Used to love this place. Tonight didn't seem busy at all but had horrible service. Hardly got my water refilled (just after I paid), very bland turkey burger and ordered a beer I never received.  A shame,  used to be my go to place. Will now be going to Carl's Jr instead"}
{"text":"A half order of the fries is plenty for 2 people (IMHO). W and I split the Chinese Chicken Salad and a delux burger. The salad was so huge and they already split it into 2 bowls I had to make sure that it was just one order, not 2. The fries came out first, then the salad, then the burger. The fries should have come out with the burger because by the time the burger came out, we almost finished the fries. The service was kind of slow. I don't know if the waiter was sluggish from Thanksgiving turkey or what, but he was not very quick to clear the table at all."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and best burger ever!  Every time I come to Phoenix I make it a point to go to Delux!  I eat a burger about once or twice a year and I always hope it's from Delux.  The mixed fries shopping cart is excellent and the aoli is perfect!"}
{"text":"Two years ago, I moved from the Bay Area to Phoenix (and yes, I have had Barney's burgers, and Delux is WAY better).  I moved into a place behind Delux and an addiction was spawned.  This is THE BEST PLACE in Phoenix to get your late-night eating on.  Open 'til 2 a.m., I can blame Delux for my extra 5 lbs. of Phoenix weight.    Here's what would happen: I would get into my pajamas and get into bed, at around 11 p.m.  Then, I would start thinking about the sweet potato fries with their completely crack-addictive aioli.  I would open my window a little bit and then start to smell a little burger grease.  Like a mindless zombie, I would then get OUT of bed, put on clothes, walk through the gate to Delux, and order a shopping cart of sweet potato fries and their house burger.  This would happen 2-3 times a week and it was Heaven. The herbs and seasoning on the fries make them the best I've ever had.   I took my parents here and they could not speak for several minutes.  It was that good.  Although trendy, yuppyish, etc., I was always made to feel comfortable here, even if I came in my sweats. Alone. In the night.  The only thing I would recommend for change is their salad.  I really like caprese salads and theirs would be MUCH MUCH better with a lil' fleur de sel and some balsamic reduction, NOT just watered-down balsamic.    I moved back to the Bay Area last year and have to satisfy my burger and sweet potato fries cravings at The Counter in Palo Alto.  It's a poorman's version of Delux and every time I eat there, I feel depressed with how much I miss Delux.  I have seriously contemplated buying an airline ticket and staying in a hotel just so I can go to Phoenix for a weekend and gorge myself on Delux and a few of my other favorite Phoenix restaurants.  The justifiably \"higher-than-your-average-burger-joint\" prices are somewhat defrayed if you ask for a VIP card: they give you 10% off the food at Delux and Zen 32!"}
{"text":"Warning...I am not a burger person!  I do not love burgers and I do not look for new burger joints to open up.  I still haven't been to Five Guys!  So when I say this is the best burger I've ever had, please take it with a grain of salt.  BUT...the Delux is the BEST burger I have ever had.  Honestly, it had me at gruyère cheese!  Everything is perfect on this burger.  It's non-traditional and I love it!  And can I please get an AMEN on the sweet potato fries!  I have tried soo many sweet potato fries at other restaurants hoping they will be as good as these and I have yet to find any.  I have no idea what they do with these fries, maybe they fry them in sugar oil, I have no idea what makes them great, but you MUST get an order of them!  Yes, they are busy and the place is small and loud!  I've always gotten excellent service. They have a great beer selection...they even have my favorite, Hoegaarden!  And for that reason alone I would give them 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Trendy spot in the heart of the must-be-there Ossington strip, but the food is mediocre and overpriced. Avoid the steak at all costs.  The 4 of us went to Delux on a Friday night, and despite a reservation waitied for our table. The service is good and helpful, and the menu, while spares, had some interesting options. Overall, the portion sizes are small. You get 6 chickpea frites for $5, which seemed excessive (though they are excellent). The $10 goat cheese salad was a small pile of greens, and 1 crusted puck of cheese. While tasty, it was not exactly innovative cuisine.  The real disaster was the steak frites. On their recommendation, I took it medium rare which didn't put me off. What was horrific was the texture. The meat was very lean and sinewy, and tasted more like a $3 special at No-Frills than a $21 entree. Since you only get 7 strips of pre-cut steak, it was particularly appalling.  With so many great places to eat in the city, I can't say this is worth the money."}
{"text":"I was brimming with trailer trash jokes when I first heard about Delux. The idea of a classy hamburger joint seemed like an oxymoron to me. Now it just seems genius. They have an excellent selection of micro-brews. An upscale atmosphere and the burgers are some of the best I've had. I guess its not so much fancy than it is quality. Its a nice enough place to feel comfortable if your dressed up or in t-shirt and jeans.  Hagan Daz milkshakes are better (and cheaper) here than they are at the Hagan Daz store."}
{"text":"Brunch in Toronto is usually very depressing.  Aunties & Uncles excepted, the waiting is just not worth it.  Delux is different.  You can go on Saturday and have a wonderful sandwich and feel happy about your life instead of looking down at a plate of wimpy hash browns, wondering where it all went wrong."}
{"text":"Delux, a trendy, happening Burger joint in the Biltmore area. Why the hell is this metal head going there to eat??  - Great selection of beer on tap. The bar offerings are 3/4's of the menu. They did a good job on creating signature drinks and breaking down the beer selection into styles, Lagers, Ambers, Porters/Stouts, etc. To help the not so intelligent beer drinker figure out what looked delicious.   -Pop quiz: How does a restaurant get away selling a hamburger for $9.50? Topless servers? No. Lottery ticket with every purchase? No. It's by hand crafting their burgers, with bits of blue cheese, serving them with rocket (arugula for the lame) and caramelized onions on a bakery roll. The burgers are cooked to the customers specifics, Rare, Med, Rare, etc, which is a nice change of pace from the fast food joints. The roll does get a bit soggy, but that is just culinary chemistry. When proteins cook, they squeeze moisture out. Once a burger goes straight from grill to bun and cut in half, the juices start flowing. They might want to revisit their burger display idea and either leave it whole or let it rest for a few minutes after grilling to let the juices redistribute.   -Also their sweet tater fries are delicious. I'm sure they're commercial made fries, but they are tasty. And served in a cute little mini-shopping cart (Gag me now)  All in all. Want something to eat after 10pm? Go get a burger and beer and hangout on the patio."}
{"text":"The only place I have ever given five stars to! Some of the best burgers in town. I love how all their animal byproducts are raised being fed a grass only diet. Hot dogs here are also amazing and probably the best I ever had. They also have a great chicken sandwich that comes with peppers and zucchini that I can't get enough of. I suggest you order an order of their fries and you will be in for a surprise when you see what they're served in. The only complaint I have is how small it is but it isn't a big enough nuisance to knock it down a star. More locations around the valley please!"}
{"text":"I absolute love the vegetable panini and sweet potato fries.  The aioli that they make is the best, you can forget the ketchup."}
{"text":"I was dining outdoors at Delux next door when I spied a glass case of cupcakes.  We thought it would be nice to pick up cupcakes and tea to enjoy back at the resort.  I had the chocolate cupcake which was not good - there was 3x the amount of icing as there was cake and it was just not an enjoyable experience.  When we ordered tea, they looked at us like we had 3 heads.  We got crappy orange pekoe tea.  They gave us these huge styrofoam cups which they only filled about 1/4 of the way.  We asked for more water of course.  Then they gave us soda cup lids and straws.  Yes, straws....for hot tea.  I get that it's a multi-purpose bakery-deli-prepared foods to go type deal but maybe they should focus on getting one thing right before trying to serve too many diverse needs."}
{"text":"My new favourite restaurant in the city.   We went for a special occasion and the staff couldn't have been more helpful.  I had arranged a surprise at the end of the meal and I felt as though the staff were nearly as excited as I was for it.   The food was unbelievable and the portions are generous:  I don't see the need in ordering the extra sides.  I met the chef, Corinna, and she couldn't have been more pleasant (or darling!) The wine list is reasonably priced, along with the food.  I understand now why the place has diners coming in until 10:00 at night."}
{"text":"My husband and I had n excellent relaxing dinner at Deluxe yesterday night..  The space itself is very modern, with a calm but interesting and warm decor;  the tables were comfortable and romantic.  I ordered a market salad consisting of a combination cooked and raw local vegetables.  It was very good - all vegetables amazingly fresh, young, and perfectly cooked with an interesting dressing.  My second course, sablefish,  was also perfectly cooked  and served with a nice french sauce on the side... My husband ordered mussels and another fish dish - both of which he liked.  Overall,  a  professional-chef-level-executed creative meal at a very reasonable price.  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is not going to be a great review but I want to start by saying I LOVE the burgers and other things at Delux.  The problem is that the service has often been poor; not always but more often than it has been good.  The most consistent good service has been at the bar, especially when Boston is there; she's awesome.    For example, my wife and I went for lunch last week.  Server #1 took our order and she also asked for a diet coke which never came.  After about 10 minutes, server #2 was passing by so I asked if she could get the diet coke that we'd been waiting on; she said she would but never did.  Server #3 brought our food; good teamwork, I thought, until he walked away without asking if we needed anything else.  Both our waters were empty and we still didn't have the diet coke.  Shouldn't that just be automatic to ask a table when you deliver food?  It was when I was in the service industry.  Still, I try to cut servers a lot of slack because sometimes it's just poor training and a good attitude helps which they do have.  Anyway, at this point I finally got up to ask the 2nd server if we could get that diet coke plus water refills which we finally got.  I ordered the Mahi-mahi sandwich instead of my usual Delux burger; nothing special and wasn't worth 14.00, I'm sorry to say.  Just kind of blah.    Server #1 finally came at the end and apologized for being in the weeds and thanked us for our patience.  The place wasn't that busy, though, so I was wondering why he was behind the bar and with tables on the opposite side where the booths are.  Ok, so on to a different issue: gift cards.  I received a 50.00 gift card, used about 35.00 of it, then found out that they don't issue a new one for the balance.  Instead they asked me to fill out a form with my address so they can mail me a check!  Well, 8 weeks went by and no check.  We saved our copy and gave it to our waiter, Eric, who did a good job, by the way.  After much run-around from our manager he got the balance taken off our bill; nice job Eric!  Don't buy gift cards from here until they get a better system!  Finally, we've given up ordering our favorite sushi roll, the Tempura Shrimp, because  of the lack of coordination between kitchen and sushi bar.  Twice now, the roll took more than 25 minutes to get to our table.  I wish I could remember that server's name during the 2nd episode because he was awesome; great attitude.   So to end on a positive note the Delux burger is seriously one of the best I've ever had; love the fries, too.  I also love that they have such a great craft/import beer selection and that they DON'T carry Bud, Miller, Coors or any of that crap (I'm a beer snob.)  There is some stiff competition, though, from Ingo and others but we're still giving Delux our business; I just hope they implement some better training for some of the staff."}
{"text":"Even though I live in the area I've only been here once before and have avoided it for lunch. I hear great things about their meat dishes but they have very few vegetarian options. Went there today for a work meal and will definitely be back. There is only one veggie sandwich option but it was SO GOOD. Messy and basic but delicious. Got rice & beans as a side after trying some of someone else's and had a small salad to go with it.  For dessert we shared creme brulee and donuts which were seriously polished off. Was very happy to have given it a chance."}
{"text":"We arrived at 6 to an empty restaurant without reservations.  We were surprised they had to \"find a table\" as the place was completely empty but understood after we saw how full the place got.  The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and personable without being intrusive.  The food was also excellent.  We started with the charcuterie plate which was excellent and we had our bread replenish more then once, which was nice.  For the main we had the steak and the chicken, both great.  For dessert we had the crème brulee and that was excellent.  The ambiance was nice, the food was not overpriced, and our food was great.  We had a nice evening and would return."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Such a great (not so hidden) gem anymore. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. I love their sweet potatoe fries and their burgers are divine. The one recommendation I have is to order your burger with the bun on the side because the meat tends to be reaaally juicy so the bun can get soggy by the time it gets to the table (its still delish though!). I would highly recommend this place, even if burgers aren't your thing."}
{"text":"I've been going to deluxe for years and have never left a review because it's pretty much all been said with 500+ reviews. But, I think it's time...  Burgers are awesome! Always have been. The deluxe burger is great if you want something different. Extremely rich and delicious. The classic is good if you are more of a ketchup and mustard kinda burger eater. It was always too much food for me so I was sooo happy to see the addition of the mini burgers, woohoo.  And...you can just buy one if that's all you want. I wish they had the deluxe burger available in mini too.  As a frequent take out person, I was sorry to see the 2 go side slowly disappear. Now you have to walk in through the middle of diners eating and it's a little awkward. Then the to go counter completely disappeared and was replaced by a sushi bar. This I think is weird. If you want to do sushi, do it in another spot. You are trying to squeeze too much under one roof.   Also, my last take out order had extremely soggy sweet potato fries. They were cold, floppy and inedible. I didn't take away a star for this because it's the first time it happened. But, come on. Every drive through in town can provide warm crispy fries...so can you. They are amazing when done right!  Go here if you want a great burger and fries. The root beer and beet salad are also very good."}
{"text":"Burger was fresh, cooked to the right temp, slightly under seasoned, great service, priced a little high (to be expected).  I have had better, but I would definitely go back if in the area"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant.  I've been a patron for several years now, and I find the food to be very consistent.  The atmosphere is cool, very low-key and casual.  I also love that they're open until 2AM (at least on weekends... I'm not sure about weekdays).    I cannot post a review about Delux without recommending both the Delux burger and sweet potato fries.  The burger has always been cooked medium-rare, as ordered (don't hunt me down if they mess yours up), and the fries are worthy of being served at the Pearly Gates.  Said another way, I USED to think The Vig Uptown had the best sweet spuds in town.    I can also vouch for the beet salad and Chinese chicken salad.  Oh, and the Haagen Dazs strawberry shake/malt thing will make your messy divorce seem like a lighthearted disagreement.  And before you complain about the $6 price tag, remember how much your divorce lawyer cost you...  They also serve sushi now, and although I won't go anywhere near it (I was born this way!), I did sample my friend's Vegas roll, and...yeah... why don't you try those too.    The reason I award 4 and not 5 stars is because I find the service to be inconsistent.  Sometimes it can be great, and other times, I feel like my server would rather be anywhere else.  Considering that I eat out alone a lot, an absent or bland server can ruin a dining experience for me.  Don't project your bad day onto me, please.  Ain't nobody got time for that!"}
{"text":"Always slow and rude staff I've had multiple terrible experiences here. If it's late and you want food go next door to Mexx32 it's 1000x times better"}
{"text":"Love the sweet potato fries!! And serving it in a mini-sized grocery cart makes the whole dining experience fun! Then it comes to the burger, my medium cooked juicy classic delux with applewood bacon and jack cheese, so so good!!"}
{"text":"Delux is very over-rated and over-priced. The burgers were not \"top quality\" as the Phoenix Magazine recently illustrated. Despite the friendly wait staff, I would not recommend."}
{"text":"The Delux burger and sweet potato fries are my favorite! The employees are friendly and the food is so flavorful and delicious. Depending on when you go, sometimes it can get loud inside at prime time, but it is a really neat atmosphere, so it is worth it. Definitely my favorite burger establishment to eat at!"}
{"text":"Delux has been my go-to Burger place (other than In-n-Out of course) during my time in Arizona. Delux is open until 2AM.... 2AM!! Open until 2AM on sundays is unheard of! Given that I'm a night owl, Andrew and Delux are a match made in heaven.   The owner of Delux also owns the Zen 32 sushi bar and Revo Burrito, which all happen to be in the same shopping center. He controls 4 store fronts (also Delux To Go), which makes a pretty impressive representation in such a small area.  Delux offers indoor and outside seating, but like other yelpers mentioned, if you come with a party with more than 4, be prepared to wait. Most tables only sit 4, and will have to be moved together. There is a long community table in the center of the restaurant, which is a nice change for Phoenix... I say this because Phoenix seems like a place where people in restaurants pretend they're eating in their homes... and it's a social faux pas to talk to your neighbor.   Now for the food. The burgers are delicious. I personally recommend the delux burger. This comes with a cheese blend (which I always ask for no cheese, so I can't review it), bacon, sauteed onions, and arugula. I get this medium and with added tomato and pickles. Ask for a side of the aioli and ketchup to smear this on your bun, you'll thank me later.  As a compliment to your meal, order the sweet potato fries. The french fries are pretty standard, but the sweet potato fries are excellent. They come in a mini metal grocery shopping cart, which adds a nice touch. These are served with a side of the aioli and ketchup.  Delux has a very nice drink menu, with a large variety of beers and interesting drinks.   For the atmosphere, the restaurant is very hip, but far from hipster (which is good). You'll feel comfortable here dressed in either a jacket and jeans or even shorts and a t-shirt (you'll see both groups represented).  In summary, the food is excellent, the atmosphere is great, and the hours of unbeatable."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and they have never disappointed.  The burgers are consistently top notch and the french fries are crispy and delicious.  I love the dipping sauces as well.  Even though I only eat the burgers when we go here, other guest in our party have enjoyed the salads and the turkey burgers.  The only downer with this place is the wait times and it tries to be too swanky.  However, it doesn't keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from New Times Best Of.  My foodie friends and I went there.  The wait is usually long -- plan for that.    If you aren't planning on getting a hamburger then don't bother coming here.  There really should be only one thing on the menu: the Delux Burger.  Order it.  It's good, tasty, plenty of portion.  Get some fries (mix regular and sweet potato fries) and enjoy.  I'm not sure it is a burger that makes me MUST come back every time I want a burger (we don't live close), but it was VERY good.  In fact, if I lived closer, I'd frequent the place more.  The place is a bit crowded, and definitely LOUD on busy nights.  It's a bar pretty much, so keep that in mind.    Root beer is tasty too.  Recommend."}
{"text":"My wife raved about Delux. She said this was the best burger she's had in the area. I finally went with her and by no means was overwhelmed. The burger was fine, but not the BEST I've ever had.  The burger was not much better than something you might get at Chilis, Red Robin Cheeburger, Cheeburger etc (my opinion). I think I actually would prefer a burger from these places over Delux.  Maybe my expectations for this place and burger were set too high and I was disappointed with the final product.  Pros: The sweet potato fries and dipping sauce was very good. The service was excellent.  Cons: Limited seating and basically rubbing shoulders with the person next to you because you are packed in so tight. T the lighting in the bathroom is very dark. I'm shocked techno wasn't being played when I walked in. I didn't like the trendy nightclub feel of this place."}
{"text":"I have been to Delux 4 times and have had excellent food every time.  So glad we were told from friends to check it out.  Their Classic burger is amazing!  Sweet potato fries are my kids favorite."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of their burgers but I was a fan of a few other things so will give them another shot. The service was outstanding, the fries are tasty & come in a cute shopping cart. I like the ambiance & the pear ale. Prices are a little high for what you get."}
{"text":"Delux is an upscale burger joint located on Camelback Rd. The food was pretty high quality and I enjoyed my lunch there. If you go there you have to get the sweet potato fries. It is an absolute requirement. They are open late making them a great option instead of a fast food drive through. They also have a large variety of beer on tap which is a nice plus."}
{"text":"Fast food taste and portion sizes. I'm not sure why this place has won so many awards.   The classic burger didn't have much flavor despite having lettuce, pickles, onions, tomato, swiss cheese, and ketchup. The burger felt dry and wasn't very juicy. The fries were extremely large in quantity but not very tasty. They reminded me of luke warm fast food fries.  My girlfriend got the veggie burger and did really like the patty itself, but wasn't a fan of the rest.  Finally, the service was really slow and we were cramped in a table on the patio sanwhiched between several other tables.  Go to hopdoddys and spend less money and get way better food."}
{"text":"Got two lucky bar stools when the place was packed. I went when I was not that hungry and I loved it. Was there on a good night for people watching."}
{"text":"Visited Delux on our \"babymoon\" roadtrip through AZ in May.  I'm typically not a huge meat eater but, being pregnant clearly had an impact on my eating habits (needed more iron in my diet).    We checked out Yelp for the Scottsdale area and saw fantastic reviews so decided to give it a try.  We were not disappointed, in fact we're now super bummed that we don't have one out here in CA.    I had the Classic burger (would have loved the Delux but, was off the gruyere due to bébé) husband did have the Delux and we split the half and half sweet potato / regular fries.  We agreed these were hands down the best burgers we've had at a restaurant. Super fresh meat, super fresh produce, even the rolls they were on were outstanding.  Fries were tasty as well.    Not only was the food outstanding but, the on tap selection of beer was incredibly impressive.  Then top it off with outstanding service - this place really is the whole package.  Our server (wish I could remember his name) was super helpful - answered all my crazy pregnant lady questions, actually walked me over to the take out side of the business to find a pasteurized juice (he looked at the labels with me!), was extremely knowledgable about the beers and without being asked, brought samples of a few the hubby inquired about so he could sample them; this after the hubby had ordered a pint of one he recommended.  The management of this place clearly know what they are doing.    I wish wish wish we had places like this out here in our neck of the woods (\"the counter\" has really lost their edge).  Next time we're in AZ we will definitely be back (and I'll be ordering that Delux burger!)"}
{"text":"This is a tough one for me. Growing up, I came to Delus and its sister sushi restaurant, Zen32 all the time. Then Zen closed and they've apparently merged the two with a limited sushi menu at a burger joint. Kind of an incongruous concept, but honestly, there aren't many sushi choices nearby, so I guess I kind of get it.   Went there last week since I was visiting my family, and we wanted burgers.   So first the good. Fries are awesome, especially the sweet potato fries. They were hot, crisp, and just as I remembered.   Now, the not so good. The sushi. It was convenience store quality. The octopus was tough and rubbery (yes I know it is octopus, but there is a difference between good and old octopus). Yellowtail was fishy.  Portions are generous, but we only ate about half of what we ordered. The rest got sent back. Waitress assured us that the fish was fresh. Maybe they just don't get very high grade fish.  She did try to make things right, and gave us 20% off the bill.   Burgers were good. Nothing crazy. I had a turkey burger. Dad had grilled veggies, and mom did the chicken sandwich. Chicken sandwich had a giant bun with a not so big piece of chicken.   Overall, meh"}
{"text":"This may be an unpopular rating, but the expression \"meh, I've experienced better\", fits perfectly.  We were seated at a restaurant down the mall (how ghetto-the mall) when we realized that it was a prix-fixe menu.  After remembering  that we passed Delux on the way in, we decided that it sounded better, so after feeling silly leaving the restaurant, we walked \"through the mall\" over to Delux.  Had a super fun martini drink, and eyed the extensive beer menu (although I don't love beer) and proceeded to have a burger and split the mixed fries.  Burger was just okay, fries were good.  My partner had the fish sandwich which she says was just okay, all in all, it was cute, trendy, good beer selection, but not impressive food."}
{"text":"Any place that serves sweet potato french fries rates high in my book. Couple the fries with the savory dipping sauce and a cute presentation --the fries came out in a little metal shopping cart (everyone say \"awe\") --and I'll give the place a five star rating.   So, why the three star rating? Well, the place is just too small for its britches. The space is cramped. For the price I'm paying for the burger, I don't want to feel my elbows rubbing against a stranger sitting next to me.   Speaking of the burger. My husband ordered the Delux burger and proclaimed it one the best burgers he's had!   I ordered a Chinese Chicken Salad and was surprised that the chicken looked and tasted like it was processed (not freshly grilled). It was a savory salad -- I just want fresh chicken on my salad - especially when I'm paying $12 bucks for a salad.   Another downside is that Delux is located in a strip mall. I think I would find the place more endearing if it were located, say, on Central Avenue as a standalone restaurant. Also, one other thing to note: The place seems to be frequented by a younger crowd (high school and college age kids driving up in their BMWs and Land Rovers). I'm not making judgements. I'm just sayinggggg....."}

{"text":"I was working in Phoenix and was told that I had to try Delux, as they had the best burger and sweet potato fries I would ever have.  The fries were pretty good, but I don't think they were anything above average.  The burger, though, I thought left a lot to be desired.  It was juicy, but I would actually call it more grease-laden than truly juicy.  I like a moist burger, but I don't want grease dripping off the bun.  That was my major problem.  That may be what some people like, but I didn't."}
{"text":"Ordered burgers and fries carry out yesterday.   As the person is checking my order at the back counter she drops a bag of my fries onto the floor and proceeds to pick it up off the floor and put it into my to go bag !  Fortunately I happened to be watching and made her take them out and have a new order cooked for me.  Amazingly she did not throw the dropped bag of fries away but left them by the other waiting to go orders.  Hopefully she did not give them to another unsuspecting carry out customer.   I'll never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Very average burger. Overpriced for what you get.  Fries average.  Wasn't all that impressed.  Five Guys has better burgers and fries.  Would I eat here again...no."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place! Burgers are magic. Try the sweet potato fries with house fry sauce, it's the best around. Whoever is in charge of the huge beer selection knows what they're doing. Cool modern decor too."}
{"text":"Delux vaguely irritates me and I can't quite figure out why. It might be that because since it has opened, Phoenix magazine has breathlessly stroked it with loving essay after loving essay, complete with pictures, all of which painstakingly include its one gimmick, a miniature shopping cart to deliver french fries in. Still, sometimes you want a good burger, and last night was one of those sometimes, so we decided to head over to Delux at long last and check it out. Have you ever thought to yourself \"ha ha, if there is one thing I know for sure in this world, it is that a glorified hamburger joint could never have a menu that could be considered pretentious?\" If so, it is clear that you haven't been to Delux. The menu, six pages long, devotes one half of one page to its two hamburgers (signature and classic), one and a half pages to other food and four pages to various types of booze you've never heard of. In the food section, their ground beef, its origin and the manner in which it is prepared is described regally, using language clearly designed to indicate that you should be thankful you only have to pay ten bucks for it!  OK, so what of it? It's the Biltmore, I knew I was facing up a ten-dollar burger, so STFU and get on with it, right? Well there's no getting around it. This is a damned fine hamburger. It's not often that you will get to a place where it's menu SUGGESTS that their burgers are best served medium rare - rather than suggesting that if you get it medium rare there's a chance you could DIE. This one simple fact more than any other made me certain that Delux isn't just flapping its gums about the origin of their meat. They know where it comes from and are close enough to it to suggest that you can have it prepared in a manner that might put you in the hospital if you were dealing with commercial ground beef. They deserve a lot of kudos for this. I had their classic burger with American cheese (because blue cheese and carmelized onions, found on their \"signature\" burger - are not my thing on a hamburger). I had it medium rare. It was absolutely fantastic, easily the best burger I've had in this city. So there. I said it. The shopping cart is cute if non-sequitur. The regular fries were merely OK. I liked the sweet potato fries better than I thought I would, but the suggestion that a lot of yelpers have made that they are the second coming is a tad overblown.  The service was absolutely great, but I doubt that my experience could be considered a test case, because we were there off-peak and there were more employees present than patrons. Seriously, the place can't be any bigger than 1500 square feet, and I counted nine employees! Plus one for helping out the local economy, but minus several million for efficiency?   All in all, this place is too full of itself, but you can't argue with the end result. When I want a good burger, I'll be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars out of 5 (really wish Yelp would let us give half stars)  My friends and I went to Delux on Saturday with the intention of having lunch, but were slightly disappointed to find out they only had brunch on Sundays.  I guess we should have paid a bit more attention to their website, but I figured brunch was a universal weekend thing.  Nonetheless, we stayed for lunch and had a great time.  The decor is comfy and relaxed and the staff are knowledgeable and kind.  I ordered the chicken sandwich with a side of conch fritters.  When I visited the Bahamas, I remember having the best conch fritters, so I was excited to see this on the menu.  These fritters lacked the seafood taste I was looking for, and was on the bland side.  The chicken sandwich, on the other hand was amazing.  The bread was nice and soft and the tomato and avocado gave it a great fresh flavour.  The chicken was also well seasoned and moist.  I always worry that chicken will be dried out, so I always order it with a bit of apprehension, but I was pleasantly surprised.    Overall it's a great spot.  I hear they do a great dinner as well, so I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"We were out for a walk one day, not intending on stopping for food, and realized halfway through we wouldn't make it home on empty stomachs. We were on Ossington, and one of the only restaurants we'd tried on this strip was the Golden Turtle, but we wanted a more hipster style brunch and walked into the first such place we saw.  We didn't realize until after we were seated that it was Cuban food - one of our favourite cuisines. The coffee was delicious, the service was friendly, and the food was quite good. It was a little on the pricey side but that wasn't unexpected. My biggest issue is that it was quite chilly inside the restaurant and I had to wear my coat throughout the meal.  I had the breakfast sandwich. It was a messy affair due to several slippery fillings, but tasted great and the bun was fantastic! My boyfriend had the Cuban breakfast which he quite enjoyed. We probably wouldn't make a point of returning, but if we find ourselves in the area again I wouldn't shy away."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC!  The sweet potato fries steals the show.  The burgers are great and the beer selection is only second to the Yard House. I may or may not have had six too many beers on more than one occasion.  There is a reason this place gets Best of Phoenix every year!  Hip, good prices and the best sp fries I have ever had!"}
{"text":"This intimate and narrow restaurant oozes with cool and funkiness, only identified by a big sign with a '92 with an arrow through it'.  Occupying Sparrow's previous space on Ossington, Delux has been on my list of places to try for at least a year.  It's a small space so reservations go fast and the last time I tried to go - we stood waiting for our reservation for about 20 minutes before we decided to check out another spot as we were starving.   And I am happy I made it there again and actually got seated right away! I was adamant that I needed to try their famous Cubano pulled pork sandwich since I have heard it's absolutely delightful.  So Steve and I decide to share it as our appetizer.  The pork is cured in cider and molasses and is tender and sweet.  It's paired with grainy mustard, chipolte mayo, chopped cornichons and red onion to create a balance of sweet and sour which is delicious and addictive.  The fries are salty and crunchy which is a great compliment for the dish."}
{"text":"Delux is awesome! I dined here for the first time a few weeks ago with a couple of my girlfriends. The shopping cart of fries is a must! Their burgers were amazing as well! The manager and wait staff were very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere is awesome as well, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went back and had the chinese chicken salad, which was awesome, virtually identical to the one at Houstons but that's ok, I love it anyway.  Our server was great.  My friend had the bisque (daily)  and loved it and we shared jam fries.  Great experience, even better than my previous one."}
{"text":"I know it's totally creepy, but I fantasize about those sweet potato fries and aioli. Like a bathtub made out of sweet potato fries and filled up with aioli. Or a sweet potato fries swimsuit in a swimming pool of aioli. You get the point. I'm not proud of it. Especially because adding $6 fries to my $9 veggie panini is not a frugal choice. But there is no way I can go to Delux and not get those goddamn fries!  The kitchen is open late 7 days a week. It's wonderful. I can get my fix at 1:30am on a Sunday, even! If You show up near typical dinner time, though, prepare to wait. Try not to stare too hungrily at all the patio diners stuffing their faces with burgers and beer.   The service is usually decent and the food is yummy. But all the bread and cheese and, yes, sweet potato fries, make me feel a little regretful and terribly sleepy afterward."}
{"text":"This place was amazing when my family and I went for my birthday last week. It serves 2 of my favorite foods in one place. Burgers and sushi. Both were the  bomb! Between 4 people,  we Just  about ordered one of everything off the sushi menu plus a burger.  Everything  was delicious!!  And the service......  Douglas waited on us and was phenomenal. He didn't miss a beat.  I also liked the ambiance. Chill.  Cool community table in the middle that had neat lights. There was music playing although you could barely hear it.   We will be back. Very soon."}
{"text":"Swanky little burger joint - I loved it!  The Delux signature burger is fantastic. I loved the arugula and carmelized onions.  The fries are delicious and come in a little shopping cart!  Don't forget to have the fry sauce!!  Great service, awesome beer selection!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"By far one of the best hamburgers around. Fries served in a little shopping cart and the mixed sweet potato fries with the french fries were to die for."}
{"text":"Date Night Delux!   This place has a great atmosphere. My boyfriend and I went on our first date at Delux.  We shared a romantic mini shopping cart of french fries over a bright blue glowing table.  The Bar is lined with a great selection of Beer and I very much so enjoyed my wine.   I had the Turkey Burger, which I never do, but I was trying to appear more health conscious to my new beau.  It was the first Vege Burger Ive ever truly enjoyed! It was so juicy and cooked to perfection.  My boyfriend had the cheesburger which he devoured and in the few bites it took him to down his dinner, he made \"Mmmmm\" noises the entire time with his eyes closed as if he was in Burger Heaven.   The Staff was pretty attentive, and the open kitchen kept things interesting with the occasional flames of fire catching my eye.  The lighting was great, the music was good, the TVs had the right games on and even with all of that going on the mood was quiet and serene with a touch of intimate.  My only semi negative review is the location.  Its in a little shopping center, next to a Safeway and a frozen yogurt spot. A place like this deserves a more swanky, downtown feeling location with a nice view.   My boyfriend lives out of town but we go to Delux every time he's back to visit! Its our favorite Date Night Place with a twist of our own romantic sentimental value.   I recommend Delux  *Said So By Starr"}
{"text":"Definitely more French than Cuban. The lunch menu looked to have more Cuban to it but we were there for dinner.  Small and cozy place with a cool look and vibe. We were seated in the back room which was comfortable. We had to wait 20 mins for our table but at least they compensated us with some bubbly.  My wife and I shared the mushroom tart for appetizer which was tasty. It came with some greens so didn't feel guilty for not ordering a salad. I had the lamb shank which was fall-off-the-bone delicious. My wife had the steak frites which was great looking and tasty. Our dinner mates all enjoyed their food too (can't remember what they all ordered). The donuts for dessert were basically fresh and warm timbits - very tasty. Our friends had the fresh baked chocolate chip cookies which were also great.  Decent wine list.  Service ended up being very friendly and efficient. Can see us going back again."}
{"text":"Happily, Delux has managed to survive the inflated hype and clientele that plagued the Ossington strip for several years.  It now imparts more of a neighbourhood feel; save weekends, we often walk in without a reservation and tend to not have problems getting a table.   The service is reliable and the food is consistent: updated classics without unnecessary embellishment. The coffee creme brulée is terrific and the menu is definitely a nice reflection of the Chef's time at Chez Henri."}
{"text":"Not much in to burgers. But this place burgers are truly 5 stars. Very professional customer service,  clean place, and very modern. I will be back for sure :)"}
{"text":"One of the few places I recommend in Phoenix. The delux burger here is just WONDERFUL! Another GR8 thing about Delux is that the place is open daily till 2 AM! Perfect 4 after a concert or other late night outing."}
{"text":"First time going there was this weekend, and took some friends from LA out prior to a night out in Old Town.  I had heard nothing but good things, and was pleasantly surprised immediately walking in the door to find that they had 20+ quality beers on tap.    Split the Delux Burger with the lady and we had a basket (shopping cart) of those delicious mixed fries.  The fries and sweet potato fries were delicious and the burger was great.  Not the most amazing burger I have ever had, but when I can grab bar food of that quality at 10:30pm and spend less then $30 for 2 people, I can't complain.  Only complaint was the music...too many restaurants have the cheeseball Thievery Corporation and other knockoffs droning in the background."}
{"text":"Great food, great environment. Burgers are great but the FRIES and SHAKES rock the party that rock the body!!!  We have been going there for about 9 months and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Went to Delux  on a Sunday night in December to celebrate the holidays.  Since our group consisted of 16 people, the restaurant requested (in advance) that we do a prix-fixe menu.  That was fine with us.   The menu choices were alright, but I was certainly not blown away by the options.   Our options for apps were a poached pear salad, charcuterie (all pates), or \"tiny white fish\".  I chose the fish, not realizing that it is many individual whole fish, deep fried in batter.  While delicious, I was a bit put off once I learned exactly what I was eating.   Our options for mains were scallops, steak frites, or duck.  Almost everyone chose the steak frites.  While enjoyable, it was nothing to write home about.  Others in my group were far more impressed than I was.    Dessert was impressive.  They brought us all empty dessert plates, and it occurred to me that it was going to be family-style dessert.  I immediately worried that there would not be enough to go around.  But they then began to bring out plate after plate of warm, fresh-baked cookies (delicious!).  And just when we thought that was enough to go around, they also brought out fresh, warm \"doughnuts\" (timbit-shaped).   Dessert won me over.    Service was decent (although the waitress confused the bill and told us an incorrect per-person cost which would not have covered the whole bill.... luckily we double-checked her math before too many people left and underpayed).  They gave us the back room to ourselves which worked out great, although the acoustics weren't great and it seemed excessively noisy and difficult to hear each other.  I understand their brunch and full menu are beyond impressive.  So I may try this place again.  I enjoyed it, but won't be sending everyone there in a rush."}
{"text":"Dope spot! Love going too this place for a late night bite too eat....sushi happy hour for sure! Plus the vibe is trendy but not at the same time idk ! This is place is definitely somewhere too check out when it's past 10 every night of the week. And try too find James he's the man always on top of everything super friendly and very professional even at times of distress.....furthermore this place isn't that type of corporate establishment either... Thanks deuces!"}
{"text":"Open until 2AM!!  Phoenix for some reason is lacking on late night dining. This is why I give Delux gets five stars. The food amazing and ambiance up-to-date, open until 2AM seven day a week."}
{"text":"Delux rocks!! I always get the grilled cheese and it is delicous!! sooo good. I order take out pretty much every week from Delux, and my bf always gets the 'delux burger' it is soo good too. The mixed fries are so tasty. Also they don't close at 9 pm like most other restaurants! So if you are feeling like a late night snack definitly try this place..."}
{"text":"Where is the half star option so that I can give this the Goldilocks rating of 3.5? I rolled into Delux with high expectations on a Wednesday night with the city in a full-blown table drought (Delux was not our first stop in attempting to secure a table that evening). What recession, eh? Oh yeah, the food... How was it? Not bad. Not great. Just plain good. I had the chicken and my buddy had the steak.  The preparations were solid and the presentation was what you'd expect . With a glass of Chilean Cab each we were out the door around the $80 mark (before tip). And therein lies the problem with this joint. The food is good. The room is nice. The service is more than acceptable. However, I think it's simply a bit too pricey for what you get. If I were to try and quantify just how overpriced I think the place is I would say \"10%\" My rationale here is that I fee like I would have been smiling at a low $70 check versus the low $80 we had to deal with. In simplest terms, I would say you get more mileage for your money elsewhere. I would think twice before going back to Delux given the myriad of options in this stratum of restaurants.  Ossington, Ossington, Ossington..."}
{"text":"Great Burgers, Great Fries, and Great Beer, is there anything else you need to know?  The Burgers are fantastic, and they have their own amazing special sauce.  Even the Veggie Panini is amazing, full of flavor, and cheese.  The Fries come out in a mini shopping car, come in both sweet potato and regular potato variety.  Get a half and half.  The dessert cookies sucked, sorry, but they did.    All in all I will be going there again!  Probably Next week!"}
{"text":"The hamburgers are great and the sweet potatoes fries are sooo fantastic."}
{"text":"I visited this place on the way home from getting my taxes done and I was famished.  My wife and I sat at the long, blue table along the middle of the restaurant...We ordered the mixed fry shopping cart with both normal fries and the sweet potato kind...Great!  The spicy aioli mix was great and the fries were seasoned just right...The Delux burger was worth the hype I'd heard..Grain-fed, well-cooked and perfectly well done!  My wife's turkey burger was good too and I usually hate turkey burgers.. They have an amazing beer selection...I actually got a Four Peaks Hop Knot and I wasn't at Papago or Four Peaks... I was really pleasantly surprised and recommend this place highly... I can only imagine after a night of drinking how a burger would taste at one in the morning!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch today based on all the positive Yelp reviews.  My boyfriend and I both had the Cuban Lunch which comes with rice w/beans, pulled pork, poached eggs and salad.  It wasn't anything special at all.  We both wish it had been.    We also had 2 Cuban coffees.  Maybe their regular lunch menu is better?    Also, the service wasn't the greatest.    Oh well, at least we tried it.  **PS.  Also, as far as \"Cuban\" food this is not very authentic, and given the fact the my boyfriend grew up in Miami Beach, he knows a thing or two about good AUTHENTIC CUBAN food and this place just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"When I first walked in to this place, it felt like a sushi restaurant - the colors, the giant movie screen of ocean water being projected on the wall, etc. I found the food to be excellent. I had the turkey burger, which came with a nice side salad. It tasted delicious - creamy aoli, avocado, tomato and lettuce on a properly seasoned and cooked turkey burger on a whole wheat bun. It was so good that I forgot that I had ordered the \"healthy option\". I also ordered a flight of beers which I customized to my taste. A great burger and beer will keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Great Burgers!My favorite is their Deluxe!Definitely Reccomend!!! Yummy .Will be Back. SERVICE WAS OPTIMAL"}
{"text":"I live in tempe so it is a bit of a drive. Every excuse I get I go. I LOVE this place! Great atmosphere, best burgers (and im not a huge fan of burgers), the fries rock and they come in a cute mini cart, they have a Must try inhouse dipping sauce that i always buy a small container of when i leave, and their milkshakes rock(i dont drink alchol). They are even open very late :)   Best burger joint in the valley of the sun by far!"}
{"text":"I'd been to Delux a few times in the past few years for dinner, and liked it. I hadn't been back for a while, so I'm not sure if there was a change in the kitchen, or management, or what, but when I returned there recently for dinner we were really disappointed. The service was incredibly slow, we were seated at the bar before getting a table, which is fine, but it took like 20 min to get our drink order, and then another 10 to bring it to us (And it wasn't a complicated order). When we were seated, I asked about the fish, which was one of the mains, and was told it was a regular fish, not seafood, but when the dinner came (and we waited about half an hour at least for that), there were mussels served with the fish. NO mention of this on the menu, or from the server. When we asked one of the servers why it was there, when there is no mention of it he just kind of wriggled around and defensively said \"what do you want us to do about it?\" and \"well we don't list everything on the menu\" ... um yeah, something like that, to which people might have allergies or dietary restrictions, you list. He then came back later and said they were changing the menu the next day. Dessert was cookies, which were like immediately out of the oven, and as my lawyer friend said, liability hot. Service in general was pretty poor. Our used dishes were left on the table for way too long, service was beyond slow (and clearly unhelpful) and when calmly questioned about the food, defensive and bordering on rude. Our main waiter was also clearly unhappy, commenting on how he'd rather not be there. I totally understand, many times I'd rather not be at work either, but when you're working as a server in a not cheap restaurant, it's probably best not to let the paying customer in on it.   And the food wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying that the service was so slow I can only assume one of their servers called in sick. There were only two servers on the floor (and no bartender or any other wait staff) which was nowhere near enough. I went there last weekend, and was disappointed at having a long wait between every step of the meal (including even ordering drinks).  For an appetizer myself and my companion ordered two orders of the chickpea fries on the servers recommendation that one would not be enough. The fries were pretty tasty (I have never had chickpea fries before, so I have nothing to compare them too) but two orders was way too much. I barely made it through my order and my friend barely finished half of hers.  What seemed like hours later, our main course arrived. I had the 'crispy duck' which was more tough than crispy. It was served on a bed of lentils, which I felt were completely unremarkable. I have made better lentils at home. My friend had the red snapper which was much better. Personally I thought it was just ok, but my friend really enjoyed it.  However, the highlight of the meal was the freshly baked chocolate chip cookies we had for desert. If you do end up going here, you must order these! Delicious!!!  They were also pretty generous in filling up my wine glass, which was nice.  All in all, I think the poor service probably tainted my experience. I probably won't go back here, but if the service improved it could be a decent place."}
{"text":"This is my home away from home take out tasty meal. The Chinese Chicken Salad is where it's at. Fresh, tasty, quick. OK, so sometimes I\"m too lazy to make something healthy... so they do it for me. Eat half now and save the rest for later - 2 meals in one! And they're nice too."}
{"text":"I ordered the Medianoche sandwich. Cured pork shoulder and gruyere on a fresh bun. When it arrived it looked daunting to say the least and I was worried I wouldn't be able to finish it. It took me less than five minutes to prove myself wrong. Next time I visit I look forward to trying either their chicken or cubano sandwich and getting some donuts to go. They're made in house and were great sweet compliment to this savory masterpiece."}
{"text":"Went last night for a girlfriend's birthday.  How CUTE is this place!  They literally served our basket of french fries in a mini shopping cart basket container!  It was adorable!  The menu is pretty simple, and the drink list surprisingly offers a rather large selection.  I'm not a big burger eater, so I ordered the grilled chicken panini.  It came on a grilled baguette topped with cheese and veggies.  It was fantastic, and huge--I took half of it home for lunch today.  I liked that there was seating both inside and out--since it's about to get a million degrees out, we opted to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the nice weather.  It was Monday night, so it was incredibly slow, but our service was still great.  My girlfriends both ordered the burger, and definitely enjoyed it.  A glass of wine was very reasonable at $6 each and our sandwiches/burgers were each about $10.  Considering I got two meals out of it, I think that's a great deal!  Because it was my friend's birthday, the server brought out a complimentary ice cream sundae, which I thought was sweet.  If I ever am craving a burger, I will have to come back"}
{"text":"Best kept secret on Camelback! Grain fed beef? Yes please! Local produce? Umm of course!  The deluxe burger is perfect! I'll be back"}
{"text":"Delicious! This burger hit the spot. I ordered the classic with American cheese and bacon; he had the Delux burger with caramelized onions plus bacon chopped into that, topped off with pepper jack cheese. The meat was prepared as I desired; very good beef from Niman Ranch. Fries were perfect; we shared a mix of regular and sweet. To top it off: chocolate malt! Next time through town we'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ossington street is booming with trendy restaurants. This is one of the good ones..."}
{"text":"this place is amazing. Every item we have gotten here has been awesome, including the veggie panini"}
{"text":"I know this may sound silly, and I'm not sure how to write this without being sarcastic, but without a doubt, this place has the best water I have ever tasted in my entire life. If I could give the water a 10 out of 10 stars I would. The water tastes like it has fallen from heaven, filtered through God's tear ducts, went through the springs of Fiji and Iceland to somehow land in my cup. I do not know if it was tap, I do not know if it was filtered but I guarantee this place has the best water. I still think about the water this places serves to this day 3 months later and I wonder quite often if I can go by this restaurant with my 10gal water jug and ask for a water refill. I've drank the waters of all different brands (to me, which all taste different), I have drank the waters of different states (tap or no tap), and maybe it is because I have gotten too used to the filtered cloudy water of the phoenix area...and maybe I'm not familiar with this location...but this place...really, has the best water. I cannot stop thinking about it. Other wise, their food and service is great as well. I did not get a burger, like the name of the restaurant suggests. I got sweet potato fries which come in a small tiny little shopping cart which I thought was endearing, and I also got some sushi which was...a bit more to be desired I suppose. But I forgave the sushi because the water was so good. I will be returning here for the water, and the burger as well.  The service was excellent, when the waiter forgot the sushi, he gave it to us for free afterwards. A+ recommended for water (if you want to taste the best water of your life)"}
{"text":"The best burger in town. I love to try new places but I keep coming back."}
{"text":"Went during lunch hour. Service was really slow in the beginning and then rushed towards the end. The burger was good, but nothing fantastic.   The fries were the highlight oddly-- they came in mini shopping carts and the spicy mustard-y sauce it came with was tasty.  I'm curious to see what the sushi side of the restaurant is like, so I'll return to check it out."}
{"text":"Ehhhh...take out the once trendy atmosphere and it's really not that impressive. Burgers seem greasy. Fries are hit and miss. Oriental chicken salad is very good.  Beer selection is great. But you can find all this and better at many of the brew pubs in town. Not worth the $$$ to me."}
{"text":"Burger, the best. Fries. Just ok.  Get a chocolate chip cookie on the way out. They are like butter."}
{"text":"Love it!  I work nearby and it is always a struggle not to go there for lunch or after work.  Be warned, unless you go off hours be prepared to wait.  But they are open late so it is a good place to stop for a late dinner or drink.  Try the Delux Burger...medium rare...it's juicy and cheezy delicousness.  Skip the regular fries and go for the Sweet Potato fries.  They have the perfect balance of sweet and salty and excellent aioli for dipping.  There is a large beer list and the salads are huge and perfect for sharing if you want to go green.  All in all, a great place to grab a excellent burger and cold beer."}
{"text":"Great food overall. Great location. Can get really, really crowded and loud, if that's your thing. I can see die-hard extroverts loving this place. 5 stars for always making my pick up orders easy and no nonsense, so I'm not held up too long."}
{"text":"Having recently moved out to LA, this is the burger and the place I miss the most.  The burgers, whether it be the standard beef or the turkey, are exceptional. The fries are a delight. The alcohol menu is beyond compare when you factor in the quality of everything else. And who can deny the shopping carts. Kudos for serving food late night. You are a fixture on my occasional trips back home."}
{"text":"I decided to surprise my daughter with an after soccer burger, and once again Delux delivered on a great dinner. Experience told me that they always leave their burgers a bit undercooked so i stressed that we really wanted medium and that is exactly what we had.  Thanks Delux!"}
{"text":"Delux has the best burger and fries in Phoenix. The meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful; the fries are divine; you can't go wrong ordering regular, sweet potato, or a mix of both kinds of fries. As much as I would love to try the other dishes, the delux burger and fries are too good not to order time and again.   If you don't do the delux, get the standard classic burger. Order it on the demi-baguette, as the regular bun gets soggy from the meat juice. Be sure to try the aioli; it's excellent.  This place is popular, so be prepared to wait, especially on the weekends. My average wait has been 45 minutes."}
{"text":"It is a burger place, but you can bring your veggie friends. No one in my group tried the veggie burger, but if it was anywhere as good as the beef kind, you'll be ecstatic.  The combination basket of regular and sweet potato fries was also addictive.  I wish I had come for dinner, because they also have an impressive draft beer selection.  I'm guessing you won't find a better beer and burger place in Phoenix.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great home made style burger.  Love the little shopping carts the fries come in.  My cousin and I spit a classic burger and a order of mixed (sweet potato and reg. potato) fries.  It was all very tasty."}
{"text":"It's great to have an option like Delux for late night grub in the Biltmore area.  I will definitely be back.  I think I showed up around 11 PM on a Sunday, before memorial day, with my girlfriend.  We were pretty hungry.  Nobody really came around to serve us, but a manager walked by and asked if we had been helped.  We said no, but we were ready to order.  She took our order and our actual server came by a few minutes later and apologized for the mix up.  They were out of the beer I ordered, but the server recommended another one (he said it was only available in a few bars in Arizona) and I went with it.  I was just hoping it wouldn't be more than the beer I originally ordered (that would have been shady), but in the end it was actually cheaper and tasted good.  Awesome.  Both my gf and I ordered burgers, medium rare (recommended temperature on the menu) with a lettuce wrap instead of bun.  The burger was good, but definitely could have rested a little longer before it was served.  We both had a huge puddle of juice on our plate after just a bite.  The huge shopping cart of sweet potato fries was pretty awesome too.  One order could feed four people, I'd say.  Delux has a good ambiance, drink selection, and prices.  In the end the service was good and there is some more food and happy hour specials I'd like to try out. Although, I'm hoping it gets a little better."}
{"text":"This place has the most moist, delicious burgers my family has ever eaten! No way to even really describe how different their burgers are from anywhere else. Order the classic burger & have it come the temperature that they recommend. The fries are great, both regular & sweet potato. The shakes are lovely and big!! Love it here!!!"}
{"text":"I love the salads here. They are so flavorful without adding too much. I always get the Chinese chicken salad, but I have tried the caprese salad and the beet salad a few times and I am very happy with all of them. I also really like the turkey burger, it's so juicy! And my favorite drink is a welled mannered martini, some places don't have blue cheese stuffed olives but they do :) and the to go side is genius, I order from there a lot too at night if it is too busy, which it does get a bit crowded in there later in the evening, being that it is kind of a smaller place. It sucks that zen 32 is gone because they used to carry some of their sushi on the to go side but I guess it looks like I'll have to give revo burrito a shot. I've been meaning to do so but I some how keep getting sucked into Delux :) oh and PS you can't pass up the sweet potato fries. Nom Nom Nom Nom! ;)"}
{"text":"The Delux Burger gets the reward for being the juiciest burger I have ever eaten. This thing is like a meat sponge that's soaked up all the grease from the grill and the blood from the cow and it's quite amazingly awesome! Everyone knows that to have a good burger, you have to have good quality beef, which means humanely raised grass-fed cows. None of that grain-fed crap or that mad-cow cannibalism.   Also, be sure to ask for some extra aioli sauce because the burger is in desperate need of a condiment.  Restaurant itself is actually quite small so I could definitely see it becoming super crowded during the rush eating hours. But we went in-between lunch and dinner so we were promptly seated.   Kk the decorum was kind of gorgeous! Whoever designed this place has a flair for life and urbanism! The place has a very neon club lighting kind of style. And even though it's not at all subtle, it's still not over-the-top and in your face. The place glows with a blue light that enchants more than dazzles. Dig it, dig it, dig."}
{"text":"Best burger in town!! Love the fries too. Great service, food is always fresh and delicious!!!! One of my favorite spots to go for lunch."}
{"text":"This place is phenom.  Never a bad meal here, and in fact, the food & service are outstanding.  Trendy, hip burger bar w sushi, and great selection of draft beers - 40 on tap, including Lagunitas & other killer brands.  Just don't come here for the beer you can maybe find elsewhere... Great vibe.  Great burgers.  Bam!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix - amazing burgers, delicious fries, and great sushi. Upbeat, positive, friendly vibe. Always enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Got the Delux Burger cooked medium.  They say it's best medium rare, but my medium burger was plenty bloody.  The bread was excellent and the meat was delectable.  Mixed fries where delicious.  Nice shopping cart!!"}
{"text":"I went back today and tried the pressed cubano (with fries) for lunch.  The cubano was delicious, but very gooey and messy, and *very* salty.  It actually didn't feel very cuban to me.  The fries were very, very good."}
{"text":"My man had a burger craving late night so we stopped in. I have heard a lot about this spot. The burgers were juicy and big. It was busy but the service was pretty good. I noticed a lady at the table next to us put the French fry holder in her purse!!! It is a cute little shopping cart! Unbelievable!! I fought with the moral issue of narcing her out... I would recommend they put a little \"deluxe\" license plate on them so at least they get extra advertising when people see it at someone's house. Or maybe look into buying a bunch and make them available for purchase. People amaze me. Bad karma momma!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for a burger especially one that didn't come out correct. Server was slow, poor service."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in the valley that serves not only the best burgers in town but also excellent sushi! It's my #1 favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"Yum - a - licious  Yea that just happened. Mixed fry basket,,,, regular fries and sweet potatoes fries in a small shopping cart with a yummy dipping sauce.   On the real, I can not stop eating those freaking fries!! Danger Danger!  oh and the burgers and service -- they are great as well. No complaints KEEP THE FRIES COMIMG!!!  and maybe give me a free fry shopping basket  and i will give you 5 stars.. lol  what, what, I know its selfish and self serving, but hey don't hate the player.... Hate the game."}
{"text":"What a lovely place to spend a Friday evening.  The service was impeccable, and we were a group of 12, most of us from NYC so with very high standards when it comes to restaurants!  We had an amazing time with wonderful food and wine.  The highlights included the duck confit, charcuterrie, pork belly and of course the donuts!  Will definitely be back for brunch one day."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great burgers.  Nice tap menu and quick service.  The burgers was awesome.  And the sushi rolls were prepared nicely."}
{"text":"Must have the fries in the miniature shopping cart. All sorts of beer. Sandwiches and salads are great, sushi after 4:00 really fresh. Outdoor patio that is covered."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town!  Awesome fries that come in a tiny shopping basket with ketchup or chipotle sauce.  .  Place has a great vibe.   Burger by itself is about 9.50, a bit pricey but very good.  It's gets packed at lunch time,  so be ready to sit very close to other people as the seating isn't so great."}
{"text":"Got the cubano lunch combo.  14$ for fries, a coke, and a sandwich. Sort of steep for what you get - but the restaurant decor is nice enough to command that price I guess.  The sandwich was OK. A pressed panini with porcetta, ham, some mustard, and cheese. Didn't wow me. Fries were nicely salted and fresh, though.  Totally empty @ mid-week lunch. Cool design inside, comfortable booths (although a little tight).  If you have someone with bad knees or are really old - don't let them go to the bathroom. The stairs to the basement are like a foot and  half apart. All I could think about was trying to get down them drunk.   Bay of pigs."}
{"text":"Ah, where do I begin? My boyfriend and I have been coming to Delux for a while now. We were looking for a place that had great burgers and fries. Also, great service. We have finally found the place that meets and exceeds our needs! We always ask for Tara because she is AMAZING. She actually cares about us and how we are doing. The Delux burger is to die for. The garlic tomato soup, the roast beef sliders, also the sushi is amazing! The shakes are to die for as well. Did I forget about the fries?! They are so amazing as well. Always come out super fresh and crispy.   If you're looking for a delicious burger, look no more."}
{"text":"First time going to Ossington (apparently the new 'hip' place to be) but it's very nice and cozy regardless. Delux is awesome, small and intimate restaurant, not many tables, and a full bar. Has a cute rustic touch to it.  Food was great, we ordered the charcuterie plate for appetizers, being someone who isn't a big fan of meat, it was actually pretty tasty. They had a great wine list too just BTW.   For the main course I had the roast chicken (WOW). Tasted the duck confit and braised short rib from my friends, also, GREAT!  As for dessert, finished off with their cinnamon donuts (like 5 timbits/donut balls) with a nice creme and caramel dip.  For the portions it was quite well priced, around 20-30$ a dish (main course) and it's just so flavorful.  Definitely recommend this place! Also, very nice and friendly, helpful staff."}
{"text":"This place is okay.  It seems like I always have to ask them to remake my burger, I always ask for it medium well because there standard medium rare is very rare, and it is always way undercooked the first time. After that they get it right."}
{"text":"Delux is brilliant in its simplicity: great gourmet burgers and lots of beer in a posh/trendy atmosphere.  The fish sandwich is worthy of 5-stars, and the selection of craft beer on tap is quite impressive.  Great spot for a date, the bathrooms are pretty sweet too."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and a very trendy location with lots of options. Delicious burgers and food. Great selection of beer on tap with a full bar."}
{"text":"I have gone to Delux probably a million times!  I love thins place so much!  I think the food is great, the service is spectacular, and it just looks really snazzy.    So everytime I go I have the chicken panini....OH! Where to begin?!?!  It's so mouth watering good!  With the sun dried tomatoes and the yummy bread...DELISH!    I've had their famous burger, and it's really good too, I'm just not one for burgers really.  I do, however, love the sweet potato fries!  I love the basket they come in and want to steal it everytime I get an order!  (jk)  They're so good!    But the one reason I go back time and time again is because BRAD works there!  He started out being my server each time by accident, and then I just started requesting him.  So worth it!  He's funny and fun and really makes the whole expierience for me.  I highly recommend you ask for him if you go!    THANKS BRAD!"}
{"text":"We came back last Friday night, on a very busy night to see if there is any improvement. WOW! We were blown away. Our waitress was amazing, very attentive and sweet, the food was amazing, we felt totally taken care of and there was nothing, I mean NOTHING to complain about! Thank you Delux for proving that your reputation has a basis. We will be back and we will recommend you to others."}
{"text":"Amazing burger ( I ordered the delux and split an order of the minis), amazing fries, and most importantly they have an amazing well gin (Bulldog - I highly recommend a gin & tonic). Their key lime pie was also amazing but I can't recommend it at the price per portion. This is THE burger place to go."}
{"text":"I actually decided to go to Delux because of the positive reviews on Yelp.  Here's what you'll find. An exceptionally knowledgeable and approachable staff. A straight-forward menu with a great variety of local options. A hip (but not too-cool-for-school) atmosphere. And an excellent meal without much buyer's regret (Dinner for two with booze, 3 courses, tax and tip was $130).  Since I made a reservation at the last minute (a reservation is a MUST for any night, not just the weekends) my partner in dine and I were added to one of the two communal tables in the back. \"Great\" I thought, good food and a chance to mingle. Unfortunately, my partner and I were the only two in this room for the first half of our meal. It certainly didn't take away from the meal, but we felt a little \"left out\" as you could hear the laughter and commotion from the front room. Unless you want a really private dinner, I suggest asking if there are other reservations for the communal table when you go. And we'll be going again for sure."}
{"text":"Really great martinis and my favorite chicken sandwich around. Only problem is the place gets old after you've been there a few times.  But it's always fun for late night."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and disappointed both times.  The delux burger is bland yet incredibly salty.  The toppings are sparse.  The meat is good quality.  For the high price, you can do much better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Was served a dirty glass of water with lipstick on it, asked for a clean one and a kids menu. Get neither. Had to ask again. Waiter didn't take the dirty glass away. Every time I talked to the waiter, I had to repeat myself. Asked for a lettuce wrapped burger which then came on a bun over 20 minutes later. Not pleased with the service and will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is so convenient.  I used to place a call for take out every Sunday after church.  I usually had a hard time finding a parking place and then going to the bar to pick up my order.  Now, I can simply pull into the parking space up front that is reserved for take out and pick up my food.  This was a great idea, Lenny!  I also love the display of tempting cupcakes...too bad I am on a diet!"}
{"text":"Will not be going back. Food was flavorless and for the price I rather eat three Cheeseburgers at In and Out. Chicken tasted like it was not seasoned at all and the veggies that were suppose to come on the sandwich were more like 3 small slices and that was it. Waitress was just not helpful, slow, and seemed like she did not want to be at work at all. A smile goes a long way."}
{"text":"In fairness, I went back to Delux because I was with someone who wanted sweet potato fries and it was the most convenient place to go.  I figured I try to talk to a different manager.  The guy was actually very nice, and was nice again when I came in for dinner a month or so later."}
{"text":"Holy crap!! Delux makes a great burger. I'm visiting Phoenix and my friend said this burger is on his list of 20 burgers everyone must eat before they die. Could it really be that good, I thought? A burger.   The answer is hands down, yes. Great food, great decor and atmosphere and a fantastic beer selection as well. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For a lunch place, this is definitely four stars.  We all had the pressed cubano sandwich with fries, which came with a creme-brulee for dessert (it included a coke as well, but we opted for beer as it was a going away lunch and we were sad about the person going away).  In any event, all that for $15 was great.  The sandwich was great,  (grainy mustard, barely-noticeable-except-for-their-awesome-tanginess sliced pickles, and the melty cheese (yumm)[yeah these are square brackets in a Yelp review])).  I say melty cheese because there was nothing really different or compelling about the cheese by itself. The sandwich was a unit-- a unit deliciousness. Deconstructing any of the ingredients separately would do it a disservice.   So I say to you, order the sandwich and you're 90% likely to enjoy it (and opt for the salad for dinner)."}
{"text":"If over priced small portion dishes are your thing, then this is the place for you!!!  My review of this place 3-4 years ago, would have been 5 stars!  But  the portions (the burger) has shrunk 25%, and price has gone up 25%!   The food quality has consistently been good!    But the way they've gone to increase their margins annoyed me & my friends to not go back!   The place is always busy so I don't think ownership really cares they've lost me & several of my friends business!"}
{"text":"I've always like Delux. I don't go that often, but it has always been good.  The last time I went, wasn't the exception. The burger was pretty good as well as the fries.  This time I ordered also the beet salad which was barely OK. Nothing in particular but the beets (the flavor and texture) are nonexistent.   The patio was super dark, I mean, you could have a whole braid of hair in your plate, that you would't see it.  Also the add sushi in their menu. That gives me the impression that the burgers weren't doing that great. But why sushi instead of improving their flagship dish?  Oh well, 3 solid stars.   Go there and get a delux burger, you won't regret."}
{"text":"I'm not as impressed with this here \"2go\" version of Delux as everyone else. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy eating at Delux itself once in a while (including their new turkey burger), but when you sit around waiting for your burger just as long (or even longer, because sometimes they forget about you next door) as Delux itself, \"2go\" really loses the point.  Dock a star for the useless lit-up bench-that's-not-a-bench in front of the register. Who was the brilliant mind who designed that? Makes no sense to me whatsoever.   Then we have the ready-to-pick-up cold sandwiches in the fridge, along with sushi from Zen32. Sandwiches and salads run on average in excess of $7. Are you really going to pay $7 for a pre-made sandwich or salad? You're not in an airport waiting lounge (or anywhere in London), so that can't be your excuse . Although D2Go tries enticing folks to buy the sandwiches buy throwing in a free side of potato/pasta salad.   There aren't many places to sit and wait here - coupled with the sign that basically says \"Don't even THINK about eating here, mofos.\" Yeah, I knew that already.  So for me, eh. The cooked food, when I do eat it, is still really good, but there's no point in being in the local vicinity, suddenly getting a Delux craving, walking in here on a whim and ordering a hot dish (vs. calling beforehand). You may as well dedicate yourself to just eating next door, because you'll find yourself waiting and twiddling your thumbs without a drink in hand for at least 30 minutes. The cold, pre-made sandwiches aren't really worth the price (I tried a few). The sides are decent and they offer a selection of cupcakes and other desserts. They also have a hot dog machine, if you want to forgo everything else (I haven't reached that point though - I only save that for Costco).   So in the end, D2Go is nice in theory, but a little bumpy in execution. If you don't want to wait, buy something from the fridge that's not really worth the price or call an hour beforehand. Otherwise, sit down (but not on the lit-up bench-that's-not-a-bench) and devote your energy to beating your high score on your phone's version of Tetris. It's going to be a while.  2.75 stars (round up to 3)."}
{"text":"Coming from a line of folks who love nothing better than pulling out the weber and grilling up some sort of red meat, I consider myself an avid lover of all things barbecue or 4th of July. This includes burgers.  I had heard a lot of hype about Delux, and thought that I ought to give it a try to see if it could hold up to my dad's famous Gerrick Burger - ingredients are secret!  I ordered the Delux burger, lured in by the maytag and gruyere, as there can't possibly be two better cheeses on the planet. And when you add bacon and caramelized onions, you've snagged me.  The burger was good. Well, really to be more accurate, it was above average. It didn't blow my socks off, or make my mouth water for a second.    The Sweet Potato Fries were delightful, as was the aioli they were served with.  Will I ever go back? Sure. Will I be the one to suggest a visit there? Probably not."}
{"text":"Its open late, its tasty, its better than seating at a Denny's late night, but I don't think I crave anything from there except for the Sweet Potato french fries, and if your a slob like me and don't mind a mild heart attack along with your food, ask for the Pesto Mayo with your Burger...yummmm"}
{"text":"Only delux could make me want to be a homeless shopping cart man lugging my overflowing carts of spoils from place to place. I mean... homeless people's carts are full of the best sweet potatoe fries ever also, right? The spicy sauce that comes with them, amazing.... mouthwateringly amazing.    Service is always hit or miss, one star gone for that but for the food here i would suffer far worse than pretentious scottsdaleyians that think they are above slangin' burgers.   So i like to drink martinis, dirty, Chopin, and shaken hard.  Our server returns to our table with a shaker and glass, she shakes it, pores it filling my glass to the lip, and leaves the shaker which is still full of booze. WTF are we in a dinner and i just got a malt!? How awesome is that, makes the $14 price tag much less painful.   Burgers... amazing. Red meat at its pinnacle. Beet salad is great also. Do yourself a favor and get a Rogue beer on tap, this is one of two places in AZ i have been to that carry them. I love delux, it is trendy and pretty much SUCKS unless you sit on the patio but the pros far outway the cons."}
{"text":"sweet spot posh place decent food late night treat....fun"}
{"text":"I remember coming here when I first moved to Phoenix,and thought these prices for a burger is ridiculous,but after having the delux burger with sweet potato fries,I quickly understood why,though I still thought this was expensive...Keep in mind this was 15 years ago, today I still understand why,these are damn good burgers."}
{"text":"Really great burgers! We stopped in on a Sunday morning and we were pleasantly surprised. The fries were excellent as well. They serve a variety of other grilled foods, desserts, as well as sushi after 4pm. Might stop back in to give the sushi a try!   The atmosphere is very cool, like a club mixed with a sushi bar, and the staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"I got to the airport nice and early the other day and was delighted to see that delux was serving breakfast. It sounded delicious... the perfect sandwich. One of their yummy buns with two eggs, bacon and sausage. Heck yeah.  Unfortunatly it wasn't near as good as it looked and sounded. Eggs had been cooked a while ago and were a bit dry and the bun wasn't the yummy soft, fresh bun it should have been.  Fries were great. Maybe the burgers are better."}
{"text":"My husband had the burger and I had the hot dog and fries.  My hot dog was pretty good, not amazing, but good.   The fries were very good and I could've had a ton more of those.  Our server was GREAT and he recommended the Bever Sweet & Spicy mustard to go with the hot dog, which was delicious.  He did recommend the burger over the hot dog, but I had my mind set on the hot dog.  I tasted my husbands burger, it was AMAZING and I can't wait to come back and have my own!   Then someone came by and added a cake advertisement to the table advertisement board for My Sister Sally's cake.  First of all, it says it's for 2-4 people, it is NOT, it really is a single serving size, but my husband and I shared it because we were going by the recommendation.  Secondly, it was ok, the frosting was really good, but the cake was really so-so.  it was a single layer, and was somewhat dry.  Lastly,  this piece of cake was priced so high considering what I just told you, at $8.50, we were very disappointed.  Our server had recommended the banana split over the cake, but again, we had our minds made up.  Listen to your server!  We will come back for the burger and fries and the banana split!  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"The food is good, esp for burgers they say, which I don't eat.  The veggie one is good (albeit a bit spicy) and the grape chicken and celery salad (yeah, sounds weird) was pretty good too.  What bugs me is the setup - one uber-dark, long, narrow dining room with oversized booths.  It's great if you want to watch tv but since I go simply to eat, I give it 3 stars."}
{"text":"\"Best Late Night Burger spot in Phoenix\" as voted by Eric M of Yelp.  Portions are huge so split a burger with a date and a shopping cart full of fries with their amazing dipping sauces. Then sit back and enjoy some great local beers or whatever else they have on tap since they have a full bar until closing time.   If you're ending your night here and just eating, get a milkshake. Seriously, when can you ever go wrong getting a milkshake.   Sure food is more pricey here, but you won't get the patio dinning or late night crowd experience from your car of the [insert cheap fast food chain] parking lot, or the amazing fresh, \"all-natural\" grain fed beef. It's worth it.  Protip: Let the waiter know your sharing and they'll split the burger for you and give you an extra plate."}
{"text":"I've been obsessed with this place since my first visit and return anytime I'm craving a big, juicy burger.  My go-to is the classic burger, medium-rare, with a slice of cheddar and crispy bacon. It's always cooked to perfection, juicy and delicious. You really can taste the quality of the Neiman Ranch meat (burger & bacon). What really sets this place apart, however, is the fries & aoli. They say the fries are for sharing but my boyfriend and I always require 2 baskets and extra aoli. Both the regular and the sweet potato are to die for! Great beer selection too, really what more could you want than good beer, fries, and burgers??"}
{"text":"I visit Delux about every 2 months.  Their beer selection, shopping cart fries, outdoor patio and bathroom decor, make this a must-visit destination for a great burger.  Occasionally, there is a long wait, poor service or even mediocre cuisine.  We are taking about a burger joint in a plaza though.  It isn't fine dining and never attempts to be so.  Plan accordingly and you will enjoy a great meal here."}
{"text":"After slamming Scottsdale's Roaring Fork for their dry-as-hell Big Ass Burger, I felt it was only right I let those in the greater Phoenix area know who has a real burger.  Delux has a real burger.  Granted it is not on as many \"Top Ten\" lists as the Big Ass Burger, but how often are those things right, anyway?  I suspect those reviews are too often written by journalistic whores who make underhanded deals with restaurant owners, trading free meals on their knees and two-night-a-week access to the bottom shelf in exchange for plugging a restaurant's mediocre fare.  Luckily my fellow yelpers are much smarter than that. How much smarter?  Much smarter enough to trust a random stranger who utilizes a terrifying picture of Conrad Veidt as his personal icon and writes food reviews at 2:00 in the morning.  Damn straight!  Now, on to the food!  I have been going to Delux burger for about nine years, and the menu has grown vastly in that time.  However, I don't often stray from getting the Classic Burger.  It is always cooked great, and medium-rare means you are going to get your burger medium rare.  Full of flavor and just damn delightful.  It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth.  You know that Deftones' song, \"Passenger\"?  It's like that - but in your mouth.  If you aren't familiar with the song, trust me when I tell you this is a very good thing.  And I don't even really like the Deftones.  Or Tool.  I would also recommend the Delux Burger, the namesake, the flagship, the Big Kahuna, the Keyser Söze, the mysterious golden-light-coming-out-of-the-briefcase.  Okay, so it's not as good as all that, but it is pretty tasty.  For the Los Angelenos out there, the Delux Burger is a direct rip-off of the Father's Office Office burger (Santa Monica), complete with the baby arugula.  The difference?  Delux is less cocksure and will let you have all the ketchup you want.  Boo-ya, Father's Office.  Boo-ya.  I have never had a bad burger at this place.  The food is consistently exceptional.  My ex-girlfriend introduced me to Delux, so I cry a little bit every time, but the bittersweet, nostalgic ache in my heart is quickly soothed by the delicious red meat, grilled onions, and toasted bun I stuff in my mouth.  Despite the emotional baggage waiting for me whenever I arrive, I can still recognize it is a good place for a date.  My half-Japanese girl (who does it to me every time) really likes the sushi, and they give you as much hot water as you request to squeeze every last drop of life out of your bag of green tea.  If you are looking for a good burger, look no further than Delux.  Tell them Tommy sent you, and they will look at you blankly and nothing will happen.  You won't regret it.  Any of it."}
{"text":"As I looked beyond our table this evening I noticed the lovely decor, the funky blue neon lighting, and was reminded that people do dress up for dinner. Everyone was chatting and having a grand time. Then my two year old pushed aside the french fry cart and smeared her hand through the ketchup dish and on to my shirt. Yup - gone are those free evenings to sit around and savor time out with friends and loved ones!   This place was nice. The seating outdoors looked a little more spacious however with a record high of 111 today it did not sound appealing. The inside seating was tight.   The wait staff was friendly. I ordered a burger served medium. It came out medium rare. It was tasty and the bun was delicious. My hubby ordered the grilled cheese panini. It was made with three different cheeses and arugula. It was very good. The sweet potato french fries were well seasoned and I loved the aioli dipping sauce.   I would warn if you do have young children - this probably is not the best place to take them. Delux does have carry out. Next time we go perhaps it will be for \"date\" night. :)"}
{"text":"\"Embarrassed\".  I'm little embarrassed to have dine at this establishment at least 10 times and have yet to write a review of this place.  So a good buddy of mine met up for lunch, so we ended up choosing Delux, we both have eaten here before and we knew what they brought to the table.  This place is a great place for burgers and fries.  They are a little higher in price than your average burger joint, but you'll notice the difference in the taste and the quality of ingredients.  I believe they use a better cut of meat than most burger joints and every time I walk away satisfied. They are located off Camelback and 32nd street and are open til 2:00 in the morning.  My good friend and I ordered the same thing, The delux burger and each ordered a basket of fries.  The fries come in a shopping cart, nicely presented along with couple of dipping sauces. ( Ketchup and a Aioli)  I requested the burger medium rare and was cooked very nicely and the fries were nice and hot.  Overall I would highly recommend this place.  Great atmosphere and the service was great.  As mentioned its a little more expensive than more burger places, but its worth it.  If you are craving for the classic burger and fries, hit this place up, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"GREAT: 14 beers on tap! NOT GREAT: beer served warm.  When a reviewer goes on and on for paragraphs about the kind of \"fusion\" represented, that's a relatives or associates review you can bet.  Pointed info is the heart of YE_P!"}
{"text":"Great fries and sauce. Pretty much it. Waiters and Waitresses are usually very friendly but very busy. Kind of over-priced for what it is and very yuppie filled."}
{"text":"My other half and I were in the Phoenix area and really craving burgers, so we decided to stop by here for a late lunch. First impressions were a bit strange - I'd never heard of a sushi/burger place, but we were willing to give it a try.   I had a few complaints, for example the restaurant itself was very dimly lit and rather dark, so I had to hold the menu closer to my face to be able to read it. The bathrooms were a bit of an atrocity as well - single-person bathrooms, with the sinks out in the hallway?! Even with just a couple people waiting in line and an employee restocking the paper towels it was very cramped and awkward to move around in that tiny little hallway, so unless or until they expand and revamp their facilities make sure you use the bathroom before you leave the house.  Moving on - we were seated in the sushi half of the restaurant because upon arriving we were undecided if we'd be ordering a roll or two, which we didn't, but on the television screens above the sushi bar they were playing my favorite anime, Shokugeki no Soma (Food Wars), which I got a huge kick out of! I'll admit, I had a small fan-girl moment. It was a shame they were playing it without audio or subtitles, since I would've really enjoyed to actually watch and listen to it, but it was still an interesting and nice surprise nonetheless.  As for our food, I ordered a grilled cheese panini, which at first didn't seem like it would be enough for a meal but it was actually very tasty and filling. My boyfriend ordered one of their signature burgers, which he let me have a few bites of, and it was equally delicious.  Now, here's the story of the day: We had ordered a basket of fries to split when we ordered our entrees, and our sandwiches had arrived first. Our waitress, who was rather young and slightly ditzy but polite and friendly, said the fries would be out shortly, which was fine - and sure enough just a few minutes later we could see in the little window between the kitchen and the restaurant was our fries sitting there waiting. But unfortunately, we never got those fries... as we were eating our sandwiches we watched multiple times as our waitress stopped by the window to chat with the chef, with our fries INCHES FROM HER FACE but she still left them there and never brought them to us. It wasn't until after we finished our entrees and we were sitting there a bit disappointed with our now-cold fries still in sight at the window, our waitress finally stopped and asked \"Wait, did you guys ever get your fries?\" Uh... as our server that should be something you would know? But to her credit she was very embarrassed and apologetic at her mistake, so not only did she place a new order for fresh fries for us at no charge, but she also took the original fries and an additional 10% off our bill. While it shouldn't have happened in the first place, I'm very glad the waitress went above and beyond to fix her mistake and make sure we left happy. That's why even with the mistakes and minor complaints, the excellent food and mended mistake gets 4 stars from me. We'll definitely be back sometime in the future when we wants burgers or sushi - but hopefully they don't forget our fries next time!"}
{"text":"A vegan writing about a BURGER joint?!  Yes, it's true.  This place really does give me mixed emotions.  Here's the deal, they have an amazing selection of all craft beers (around 50 plus seasonals), they have a decent selection of local brews, by the way and they do have something for the veggie lovers.  If you order the grilled vegetable panini sans aioli and cheese, you're in the clear.  The baguettes are vegan (not the brioche buns, obvs) and they have a few salads that can be modified.  They also have a tasty gazpacho with avocado and (minus the goat cheese).  The fries are good, but I'm kind of over the whole sweet potato fries thing.  Back to the booze.   They have flights (three 5-ounce beers of your choosing, or preselected)!  They offer tasty martinis and wine, and have a fairly extensive liquor cabinet.  The staff is friendly and the vibe is pretty cool.  They are open until 2am, everyday so it's nice for those of you who like a late night snack or if you're preggs.  One more thing, they do use Niman Ranch beef, so at least you're eating grass fed beef and not contributing to the nasty system that feeds poor cows antibiotic-laden corn.  That is all."}
{"text":"Man disappointed in this burger place especially for the price $12 for a mediocre Burger I would say it was a 5 ounce Patty bun was kind of hard really nothing going on maybe 10 years ago when they open it was happening spot not anymore at least the service was decent probably won't go back"}
{"text":"Best burger in Phoenix. I don't get there often, but when I'm near the Biltmore area, I always make it a point to stop in. Order the DLuxe burger. Why mess around? It's perfect. Just get it as-is, medium rare. Then get yourself a shopping cart of sweet potato fries and dip them in the fry sauce. Do it! You won't regret it.   What else? The beer selection is amazing. And the service...the service. I can't even describe how friendly and accommodating they were today at lunch. I put my white cloth napkin across my black pants and the waitress asked if I would prefer a black napkin instead so I could match. What? That's insane attention to detail.   I've been going for 10 years. I took my wife-to-be there on one of our first dates. I take clients there. I had my bachelor party meet there for dinner before we hit the nudie bar. It's versatile like that. I'll always come back."}
{"text":"deluxe burgers. mixed sweet potato & french fries. chipotle garlic aioli. beer flights. open till 2am, 7 days a week.  need i say more..?"}
{"text":"I had the delux burger and the meat quality was perfect and came cooked as ordered. The bun was very nice."}
{"text":"I love Delux!! Especially for late nite eating an cocktails... the sweet potato fries are the best!! the staff is great, never had a bad time here!! sitting on the patio when it's not sweltering outside is the best, good place to people watch as well..."}
{"text":"So, maybe I don't get it. Maybe all the hype ruined it for me. Maybe it's gone over my head.   Only...I think I DO get it. This den of would-be Williamsburg-ites is beyond over-rated. Delux should spend less time spelling a word wrong, being lit like the interior of an alien craft, and begging for someone to confuse for them for a restaurant in the hippest part of Brooklyn...and spend more time on decent service, and food to match the lofty expectations set by your atmosphere. Which brings me to the point of all this:  the burger. The burger was, at best, okay. It didn't wow me, but it didn't repulse me either. The meat was tender and well-cooked but aside from that, I'm left wanting more...and honestly, I'm left wanting a lot more. I was led to believe that this burger would blow my socks off and that the fries would be so good, I would order another basket. The only good thing about your poorly seasoned, room temperature fries was the gimmick you delivered them to me in. You could literally hear my eyes rolling. I've had better burgers at plenty of restaurants that also weren't simultaneously clamoring for me to talk about \"how cool they were\". Our waiter was barely present;  I effectively only want to see you once in a while to refill my drink and maybe check in once the food is there...consider the ball dropped. I'd have more to say about this place and why I didn't like it, but I was too busy yawning at Delux's attempts at being \"cool\".  I do get it. You just haven't earned it yet, baby."}
{"text":"Stopped by Deluxe last night.  It's got that fun, it's-almost-like-we're-at-a-night-club ambience for people who want to feel like they're going out when they eat.  The tables were all lit up blue, the furniture is very modern and the music was hoppin'.  I ordered the Classic-Standard Burger.  The food and service was good, but I have one major complaint.  The prices are outrageous.  The burger I ordered was $9.90 and didn't come with fries, but instead, a teacup sized serving of melon. Like every other red-blooded American, I like my burger with a side of fries. It cost me $6 to get that.  (These were not $6 fries.) And while our service was otherwise good, when I asked about ordering fries for moi our waiter didn't suggest the $3 alternative (1/2 portion).  I still don't think you should have to pay additional for fries with a burger, but hey, that would've been better.   I get it, they're hip, the food is tasty, and they're kitsch so the prices are high. But there's limits to how much you can charge for a simple burger and fries.  For that price or less I can go to Houston's and get a burger with amazing shoe-string fries or get one with fries and fruit at AZ88. (Both restaurants are larger and their wine lists and menus are too.)   My advice to the owners: make your almost non-existent serving of fruit exchangeable for a satisfying portion of fries. If you are going to charge for fries as a separate, (hahem, your competitors don't), they shouldn't range from $5 (regular) - $6 (sweet potato) for a full serving.  The fries taste pretty much exactly  like Fuddruckers'."}
{"text":"Overall delux burger scores our five star award!  Reasons for this include grass fed hormone free meat, nice buns, delicious fries, and good herb teas!    The ambience is fun, casual, with cool lighting effects and a nice little patio.  We really appreciated the little touches including delivering the French fries in a little grocery cart!  Would definitely recommend especially for late night eats (huge plus of full kitchen open til 2!!)  late night joints with this quality of good are quite rare :)"}
{"text":"While the sushi is surprisingly good and very fresh, the service is painfully slow. You'll be waiting quite a while to eat. Plus, the wait staff doesn't seem to know much about the sushi to answer questions like \"is this one cooked?\" (Crabs and shrimps are typically cooked) The tiny busty bus girl is also very inconsiderate of the guests on the patio as she clears tables and covers them in new paper. The patio was nice to sit on but I'm not sure why they don't have a fan out there."}
{"text":"Sushi is not bad but the Delux burger && sweet potato fries never disappoint I like the sliders too burgers here are always on point kitchen open till 2am fuck yea !! If in sure get mix fries in the cute shopping cart a strawberry malt && the classic"}
{"text":"WTF this place has really gone downhill.  I ate here twice last week and neither time was impressive.   Meal one: My turkey burger was so dry and yucky that I only ate the avocado off the top. The burger was like hockey puck. The bun was a little stale. The fries were okay. The waitress did not notice my disdain.   Meal two: Seriously the worst grilled cheese Panini I ever had. The sweet potato fries were okay but didn't hold a candle to Fez fries.   I do like purse hooks at the bar.   I remember a time when Delux served delicious food that was well prepared and um..actually tasted good. Now two sucky sandwiches later I long for the yesteryear of Delux.  Even the a la care fries lost their charm.  Step it up Delux you are losing me!"}
{"text":"Talk about one of the best burgers in town...in fact i think houstons and this place have the best burgers in phoenix!!!! I took one bite and i was in heaven...it was a whole new take on a burger but not too crazy!! I love the fries especially when you mix the sweet potato fries with the regular ones OMG!!!  I like to dip them in ranch but you can select what you want to.dip them in...i have to thank.my sister for this place she introduced me!!! Its a great place to.go for lunch and dinner but it.is not very big so you may have to wait but its worth it!!! Its a fun place do not miss it..."}
{"text":"First time going here didn't have the best experience. Owner provided my girlfriend and I a gift certificate to come back and try again. This last time was a completely different experience. Staff was super attentive and the food was great. Also awesome that they have fresh wasabi. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Delux is a great place! I really love the sweet potatoe fries and their milkshakes are amazing!"}
{"text":"AMAZING. We were staying in Phoenix for work and asked the girl at our hotel front desk for a good burger spot. She told us about Delux where we could get burgers AND sushi. I'm preggers and was totally craving a bomb.com burger and that's exactly what I got. The meat was cooked to perfection on a delicious and filling egg bun. Their fries were addicting and come in the cutest little shopping cart, because they are a \"cart full of fries.\" Will definitely come back here next time we are in town, and again when I'm not pregnant and can eat all the raw fishies."}
{"text":"The grilled chicken panini sandwich was super yummy with the pesto sauce!!"}
{"text":"Funny thing about Phoenix: you never know where you can find a decent bite to eat.  Every year my buddies and I head down for a long weekend of Spring Training and lap dances. This year I decided I'd do some research on restaurants, as we'd been disappointed way too often.  After a long night at the Candy Store we headed to Delux. I was a little nervous about the strip mall location, but then I remembered \"this is Phoenix.\"  We showed up around 11:30 on a Sunday night. The place was packed, but they had a seat for us. The burger was awesome, only overshadowed by the incredible shopping cart of fries."}
{"text":"I've only been here once so far, but it was a good experience.  The place is fairly small, but has a little outdoor area too with misters - pretty comfy overall.  The beer selection is great - lots of good stuff on tap.  The burger I had, their signature burger, was super good.  There's some other stuff to try, but I know I'll have a hard time not wanting to just get that burger again next time I go here, which I know will be again..."}
{"text":"This place has great food, great ambiance, good service, and decent prices.  The burgers and sandwiches are all great, and the ingredients are all high quality.  We love the shopping cart with the mixed regular and sweet potato fries. And of course the reverse happy hour is always nice, too!"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Sweet potato fries are to die for, wish I could make them myself just like theirs. They come in a little mini-grocery cart, so cute! I remember we had these seasonal beer samplers - I think you get like five samples of beer or something; they tell you all about each one. Very cool. I like sitting outside so you can people-watch. Gelato Spot is a must afterward (100 feet away or so).    My only complaint would be the size of the place. You are in close quarters with everyone and can't really get the intimate feel if you're on a date."}
{"text":"Amazing! Yummy! Perfected!  That is three words to describe my experience (and many other experiences) at this restaurant.  The place is managed well from the top down.  I am always greeted immediately upon entry and have never (regardless of the hour) waited more than 30 seconds for a table.    Last night I had the Turkey Burger (outstanding, btw) and the sweet potato fries. I had the best service from Tara who was totally personable and on top of our drinks, meal, etc.  In the end she recommended a unique dessert that can only be found at their restaurant.  It was a chocolate cake with cream cheese icing and your choice of a flavor of ice cream.  I had the strawberry.  The dessert was spot on and I will definitely come back hungry for it.    I really do not think you can go wrong with their food. I have had many meals like the panini's, burgers, salads here over the past 3-4 years and they have always been good and consistent.  As a reminder, you get what you pay for, and I have no problem paying their reasonable prices for good quality food.  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"DUDE, I would TOTALLY go back. The atmosphere of this place is absolutely awesome. You walk in and it feels like a modern, classy lounge. The first thing I noticed was the ridiculous amount of beers they have on tap. As I sat down, I proceeded to count and they had 40 different beers on tap. FORTY. I've NEVER seen that many in my life!! That's raw -- way to go Delux.  DELUX BURGER (the first one on the menu) - Um, YEAH IT HIT THE SPOT. I wasn't brave enough to try the cheese that was on the burger so I swapped it for some melted cheddar. The waitress even suggested I do that if I wasn't bold enough to try this two cheese mix that was supposed to go on the burger. Shrug.   FRENCH FRIES - Kinda tasted like McDonalds...so it was GOOD.  SWEET POTATO FRIES - This is a MUST ORDER.  Anyway, your fries come in a cute small shopping cart w/ a side of ketchup and I believe what was a chipotle mayo sauce. It was tasty nonetheless and the chipotle mayo sauce tasted magnificent on your burger.  This place can get somewhat pricey but it was $10 for an orgasmic burger. YUM. Definitely a cute place to go on a casual date.  (Photos uploaded)"}
{"text":"I loved the decor. i ate the fries and I do NOT usually like fries! The aioli really lacked garlic... im used to my grandmothers burn your tongue aioli The sandwiches (me and my girlfriend split a delux burger and caprese panini halfsies) was fresh and yummy. Didn't blow my mind but very good. The waiters are super good looking and I suggest having them shirtless. Trendy but not annoying."}
{"text":"We had a friend in town and wanted a place to stop at before going bowling (not in the mood for bowling alley food).  Delux was only about a mile away and was pretty much perfect.  We split the mixed order of fries (half sweet potato, half plain old potato) which were DELISH.  They brought the fries out before the rest of the food, which was fine with us since we were hungry.  We also split a shake three ways which was fantastic.  We were all happy with our meals (Delux burger, beet salad, and mahi-mahi sandwich), and it was great sitting outside.  The only reason I didn't give a fifth star was because the service was a little spotty at times.  I'm pretty sure our server didn't come back to see how the food was though he was there several other times.  Overall a fun experience, and I'm really excited that they're open so late!"}
{"text":"Ive had the delux burger, chinese chick salad, turkey burger and enjoyed them all with every bite. They used to make these awsome apple pie cookies and they were to die for."}
{"text":"One lookat a picture of their signature burger and fries and its clear that they have completely copied Father's Office (Burger joint in Los Angeles). The problem with copying FO is that their legions of fans have no choice but to make the comparison.  So, I'm not reviewing this just as a burger, but as a FO wannabe. And as a wannabe, it falls well short of the mark.   First, although they seem to have gotten the ingredients right, the bun is too thick, the patty too thin and dry, and the toppings less flavorful. The regular fries are limp and bland, the sweet potato fries are better, but too thin. The sauce (they serve ketchup and some sort of aioli) doesn't hold a candle to FO's signature aioli.   The rest of Delux's menu is unnecessarily huge and for some reason they also serve sushi. Who wants sushi from a burger place or burgers from a sushi place?  Better to do one thing right than 2 things badly.   The ambiance isn't much better. The restaurant is located in a Safeway strip-mall. They have an indoor area mostly made up of community tables and a cramped outdoor area overlooking a parking lot with misters spraying the patrons. For some reason they decided to give it a club-like atmosphere with blue lights shining down on the badly prepared food and simultaneously made it family friendly by letting children of all ages eat there. The result is a hodgepodge of burgers, beers, parked cars, raw fish, and crying children.   All in all, a poor imitation."}
{"text":"I would give it a three, but the price just kills it.    I've been there twice and each time was a minor disappointment.  I got the turkey burger, fiance got a chicken sandwich, and we split a \"basket\" of sweet potato fries. Their \"basket\" is extremely small - even if served in a mini shopping cart.  The turkey burger falls apart easily and is sort of dry.  The killer here is the price.  This meal comes to $30 with tip.  That is pretty hefty cost for a burger and splitting a medium order of fries.  They do have a nice beer list and the cupcakes that are made next door and served as a dessert here are delicious but this doesn't outweigh the high cost, low amount fries, and the awful conversations you have to put up with (this is a personal view, and why I don't live in scottsdale).  I'd recommend checking out Soma Cafe for a better burger + sweet potato fries."}
{"text":"The best burgers in the valley, so. I've been told. Came here on a Saturday afternoon with some friends, and was blown away by the amazing blue tables, clean glasses and 2 HDTVs. Awesome."}
{"text":"Had a great time! Steven was awesome great service! Great burger! Be back again soon."}
{"text":"As a professional musician, I'm used to hunting for places to eat after 1am, which in the early-to-bed, early-to-rise culture of Phoenix is not easy unless you're willing to settle for the typical Denny's or IHOP.   Delux is a go-to spot when I can get there before they close at 2am.  And, unlike virtually any other establishment open at that time, it's not a compromise or last resort.   Food: Everything I've had--from soup to burgers, appetizers, etc. has been top notch and very delicious and properly prepared.  The burgers are obtained exclusively from one ranch and you can definitely tell the difference in quality.   Good selection of craft beers if you're into that.   Service: I've been here many times and always had excellent, friendly service.  I see some others' complaints here, but I've never personally received poor service.  The opposite is true--I've walked in more than once within minutes of closing, and not once has the staff acted in any way annoyed nor hurried me.  That is HUGE in my book.   On occasion the owner is there and he's very friendly and personable.   Atmosphere: It's trendy and upscale, but small.  I like sitting in a booth, and none exist here, but that's a relatively minor issue.  There is a nice patio out front which is comfortable for most of the year (they have lots of space heaters).    All in all, one of the best burgers in Phoenix along with other great fare.  And probably the best choice for late night dining."}
{"text":"On a Saturday night I was highly impressed with everything from the service to the food and atmosphere  Although busy my server, chelsey was amazing and although not veterans Day they approved a discount for me anyway. . that was indeed going able and beyond on any day besides it being very busy. .. and all my needs were met with no wait.   The atmosphere was busy but not overly loud where I couldn't hear my friends across from me  And the food. I know that my burger was so melt in you mouth awesome it could change a vegans mind. ..niman meat I looked it up and was very impressed about that farm  I give it 5 stars for all the above. I had a great time"}
{"text":"Ok so I'm a burger whore...been to a lot of places in the valley and this is my favorite so far. Bobby the manager is amazing! Has been known to give free cookies late at night and water while I'm waiting to get food for pick up. This place knows how to handle their customers.  The best for my money for sure."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi. The sushi is super fresh and very tasty. Dont be fooled by the way the restaurant looks, the quality of fish is top notch.  What's even more surprising is the sliders. One of the best in town and very juicy. This place is a hodgepodge of asian and american. It's confusing and awesome at same time.  They offer authentic asian sushi, but also serve one of the juiciest american sliders I've ever had. I have no idea how to categorize this restaurant, but you should just try it out. They have happy hour and reverse happy hour!  Great ambience for a date. Lenny the Owner is super nice too. He's at the restaurant usually ever night eating with the rest of us!"}
{"text":"Lots and Lots of interesting cupcakes much were tasty some were not! The decor was awesome I really liked it!"}
{"text":"THE #1 LATE NIGHT OPTION IN THE STATE. Don't get me wrong, this establishment is outstanding at any time. But after 10 you can get the best cheeseburgers and sushi and so much more.  Every time I go there the staff makes me feel like I'm their best friend.  The menu goes on and on.  Oh, and you have got to try the desserts, I recommend the vanilla milk shake.  When I first had it I felt like I was in pulp fiction, the scene where Travolta tries the shake.  It's that good.  In fact, EVERYTHING IS GREAT HERE.  I've had the sliders, basket of fries and the california, Las Vegas and rainbow rolls.  As usual I can't get past what I love but I have made an executive decision to try 1 new item every time I go there.  In closing, if you haven't been here, go.  You will not be disappointed.  Thank you Delux!"}
{"text":"Best burger place. Lived her for 5 yrs, and only Indulge burger comes even close...but still by a long shot. The turkey burger is amazing, and the caprese sandwich is even to die. The most quality ingredients around. The salads are delicious, the deserts are incredible, and if you don't mind the possibility of a wait, the staff is great too. Not to mention the beer selection is off the hook. Something for everyone. Don't have a take on the wine, not a big wine connoisseur. And also not a red meat eater, but I bring all of my out of town visitors (from the midwest...they know their beef) and they love it! MmmMMmmMMmmm!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and atmosphere. The ingredients are always fresh and tasty! I will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Delux is delicious. Their location seems hidden, and from the outside doesn't appear like much. The interior is modern, and their menu has some highlights. The highlights for me are the Delux Burger with bleu cheese, beer flights (flight #2), fry carts (a must)  with dipping sauce, & the malts. Burgers are more gourmet then backyard, but they are cooked well and come together very nicely. Service is solid, but sometimes can be a bit crowded, since it's a small spot. Don't overlook the milkshakes and malts at the end, totally worth it and you can ask for it to-go. Highly recommend Delux for anyone craving a new type of burger, & there is now a  sushi spot inside too."}
{"text":"Awesome! Hotdog was amazing, great drink specials and nice taps.. Get the Sally cake too... Jacklyn was fantastic! Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places to eat.  I don't get in here nearly often enough, but that is probably best, if I want to keep wearing the same sized pants.  I am a huge fan of the \"Standard Classic Burger\" here.  It is fresh simplicity, at it's best.  A hot, greasy burger on a fresh bun and tons of good fixings.....I go back here again and again.  Pair this up with a \"grocery basket\" of mixed fries (regular & sweet potato), and you've got yourself a great meal.  I always order extra sides of their \"fresh aioli\" sauce, which ultimately finds itself all over my burger, as well as my fries.  A quick note on their signature \"delux burger\"....very good and I love that it's served on a demi-bagette, but the maytag and gruyere cheeses are just a bit much for me.  I'm not a big blue cheese guy, and I think it just overpowers the burger.  But, if strong cheese is your thing, order away....they don't call it the \"delux burger\" for nothing!  One last comment that you may not know about delux......they serve until 2:00 AM.  So, after a night of power drinking, divert your taxi to Camelback & 32nd Street for the ultimate anti-hangover gut bomb.  Expect to wait for a seat.  I've found the wait at 1:30 AM is as long, if not longer, than it is during lunch!"}
{"text":"Delux has been a great spot for years and many burger joints have tried to copy this concept and they are good but there is one delux.  The french fry's on a cart of pretty bananas and the sweet potato style cart is just as great if not better.  I give these guys major kudos for their selection of menu items and they have great options for beer drinkers as well.  The price is reasonable for their experience."}
{"text":"Finally had a night out with a friend... and decided to go meet @ MEXX32... super cool ... and will definitely nosh there next time, wanted to check out Delux... (Both owned by a great, local restaurateur )  there was a perfect \"2 top\" on the patio... and the ambiance was perfect... fabulous menu, just enough \"café chatter\" in the background, but not overwhelming, where you cant enjoy a conversation with friends.  So.. we heard the house wine was new on the menu and fabulous... so we tried one white, one red.  Perfect temp... and absolutely devine!  Also got a tip from the table next to us, that the Lollipop Roll x a nd Zen Citrus were a must.  We hadn't planned on eating... but they were better than any I have ever had!  Fresh and top quality... all the way around.... A definite must for anyone looking for a one of a kind experience... local, unique and softly sophisticated.  Can't wait to try MEXX32!  Thank U  I give Delux a 10!"}
{"text":"Delicious food great service. In town for conference and this was a quick Uber away. The delux burger is the must get!"}
{"text":"I've been here probably five times now and this place is amazing. Their burgers got voted best in Arizona for a reason! I love their food, and the great thing is the sushi is really great too! You'd think burgers and sushi would be an odd combo but they make it amazing :) I definitely recommend this place for anyone! The shopping cart fries are the cutest ^-^"}
{"text":"mmmm Delux. I wake up and call for it in the night. I have magnificent dreams about those little grocery carts filled with mixed fries with endless sides of ketchup and that delicious pink sauce. Delux Burger, Classic Burger, Fish Sandwich...always superb. Despite the yuppie crowd, the restaurant often being a little noisy and our last waiter being a little preoccupied and strange we always leave happy."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by our uber driver and he was right it was fantastic. Root beer float was awesome, fries were great. Green chili corn soup was out of this world and the burgers bar none the best"}
{"text":"Terrific ambiance, extensive draft beer selection, and incredible food (I had the classic burger, sweet potato fries, & apple pie à la mode on this recent trip). What else do you need to get 5 star reviews from me? Oh ya, cute hostess didn't hurt!! I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"So Delux got too big and (like an evil twin) swallowed up the next storefront for this new \"to-go\" venture.  It's reminiscent of a smaller La Grande Orange, in that it's basically a glorified deli, but with all the trimmings - sandwiches, salads, sushi, bakery, plus all the regular Delux items are available as well.   About the food - think pre-made yuppie roast beef sandwiches ($7) with balsamic infused roasted red peppers or, what I had, the turkey sandwich with dijon mayo spread and cranberry relish.   The sushi is readymade as are the side salads (including a deliciously tangy southwest pasta salad) and are in a refrigerated grocery-style section along with Pom, Kemper sodas and overpriced waters such as Ty Nant, Blu and Voss.  The desserts are a welcome addition, but I thought the cupcakes (strawberry and red velvet among them) were too small for the $3 they were charging.  You're better off hoofing it to Tammie Coe or Karsh's for that price.  The cookies looked more reasonable and delicious -- the cranberry white chocolate chip had cranberry icing shavings on the top.  Yum.  There are only five or so seats in the joint, so be prepared to take it to go - as the name of the place suggests.  I guess they're upfront about that, right?"}
{"text":"So, in a competition for best beef burger around town, I'll certainly give delux their creds. The delux burger is pretty amazing. Good quality beef and super fresh bread make for a pretty great burger. The size is big, but the shape eliminates those awkward moments in trying to hold and take bites without it falling apart.   The fries are awesome as to be expected with an overly addictive aioli (sour cream, mayonnaise, cayenne, and lemon?). The sushi menu is not so expected for a burger joint. But hey - I love sushi so no complaints here.    I also have tried the turkey burger, and I wasn't over the moon. It was good, but not as amazing as their beef. Alas, this is why I will continue to go to those \"others\". However, I will say the delux has the leg up on the beef burger scene."}
{"text":"It was a burger kind of night, and we searched high and low on Yelp for \"Best Burger\" and found this place. Based on reviews, we decided to give it a shot.  It was a bit of a gamble considering we drove in from Scottsdale, but it was pretty good.  The vibe is pretty hip and swanky inside, with lighted up tables in the center row, but we opted to sit outside in the misted patio. Our server took our order for beer. Here is where things kind of went a bit south.  This place has a pretty extensive craft beer selection, with a strong selection of seasonal beers. Our server had NO idea what seasonals were on tap, and had no idea how to describe them once he figured out the list. My tip? Print out a list of seasonal beers and put them on the table.   On the plus side, they offer beer flights for all of their beers, so you can mix and match everything. Awesome sauce.   We shared a turkey burger and the chinese chopped chicken salad. Both were good. The turkey burger was moist and flavorful. Perhaps had a bit too much garlic. The salad was very good, and the portions were very good.  Overall, this was a decent place. I'd maybe give it another shot. There wasn't any huge red flags that said, \"Dave...don't come back.\" BUT, there wasn't anything that said, \"OMFG, Dave...you HAVE to come back next week and bring all of your friends.\"  Final grade. 3 stars. Solid B."}
{"text":"I was on vacation and went here for dinner and not to be repetitive but it's like the best burger I've ever had.  I couldn't understand the point of waiting for a hamburger but it was totally worth the wait.   The restaurant is so cute also I couldn't believe it.  My brother got the chicken panini which was good but if your going to go there get a burger.  I do have to say I shared a burger and a salad with a friend and it was the perfect amount of food once the sweet potato fries were added.  (those are adorable they are served out of a mini-shopping cart)  I would say go there...I loved it."}
{"text":"I really like it here. Food is great and I love the ambiance. I have had a few lackluster servers, hence the missing star. Tara is amazing however. And now I want a Delux burger :) ...medium rare, of course.   *update*   Went here today for my birthday. Medium restaurant traffic. My friend and I waited a few minutes for the manager to come up and seat us. She apologized for the wait. She sat us at a table, where we were ignored for the next 10 minutes. Eventually we left without ordering. No one had even come over for drink orders. I called to speak with the manager to let her know about our experience. Her response? \"That's weird. Well, as you saw it was hectic and we're short staffed\".   Food is good but management needs to be completely replaced.   *2nd Update*   Based on the response of the restaurant, I feel compelled to increase my rating. Not very many places listen to their customers as sincerely as they listened to me. I will be back to give this place the 5 stars their food deserves. Happy holidays."}
{"text":"I got to go service and the server I think her name was Alexis went out of her way to make sure our to go order was right and gave us extra condiments plus she was super sweet. Good job and thanks for the great customer service! I will also point out guy at door that is totally creepy that's why I couldn't give 5 stars. If you can get past him You'll get good service and great food. Thanks to the to go server for going the extra mile!!!"}
{"text":"Delux has great burgers, a good selection of beers but this once trendy great place has gone down hill. The concept has grown into a weird mishmash of who knows what is going on?? Sushi, burgers, milkshakes, French-fries, cupcakes, hotdogs, salads, fish... I am confused. The weird to-go store is just a waste of space and would serve much better as extra sitting room for the the main restaurant. Lenny Rosenberg a once great restauranteur for the valley has lost his touch as Delux approaches it's decade birthday. Time to retire Lenny?"}
{"text":"Best dam burger I have ever had.  Went there after a long day of drinking.  Split the large fries between two people, get the burger medium rare, and go for the chocolate malt."}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this place for several years and finally stopped in this past Sunday with my family for lunch. Even on a Sunday the restaurant was full but we got lucky and there was no wait for a table. Service was excellent with our waiter giving good suggestions and advice about what to order. We got a few baskets of the mixed fries - regular and sweet potatoes - which come in the miniature shopping carts as mentioned by other reviewers. The fries are delicious and my children loved the little carts.   For the main meal, my wife and I both had the Delux Burger as did my mother-in-law and my father-in-law had a salad. The burgers are big so bring your appetite or prepare to share your food! However, the burgers are delicious and well worth the reputation they have earned.  I didn't try any, but the selection of microbrews is extremely impressive and its nice to see a place with such a good representation of local and regional beers.  Finally, save room for dessert. The choices looked great and I saw other diners enjoying them. Unfortunately I was already stuffed!  Overall, Delux is definitely pricey but well worth it for one of the best burgers I have ever experienced. If I lived in Phoenix full time, I would make this a regular stop!"}
{"text":"112th review for Delux.  I give it five stars because it's the best burger in Phoenix.  Get it medium rare (rare is even better) and ENJOY.  The sweet potato fries are the best I've found as well.  Good beer selection.  Smallish restaurant can have quite a wait, particularly later at night.  Worth it though."}
{"text":"pros: +food is amazing. grilled cheese with yellow tomatoes is the bomb diggity. mixed fries & aioli rock the house. +decent vegetarian options! if you don't eat burgers, you aren't stuck ordering a mediocre salad. the grilled vegetable panini is fucking fantastic. +open until 2:00 am ALL WEEK. +papago orange blossom beer = yum +pretty interior (blue center table, nice restrooms)  cons: -pricey. would love to try the desserts, but $12 for a banana split? um, no."}
{"text":"Delux is great, they do burgers, they have a good beer selection, they do sushi, and their building is kind of split to showcase that on either side.  The right side is Delux, with bar seating in the middle, tables off to the side. There's outside seating with heaters, but I think it's still too cold the couple months Arizona acknowledges winter.   I've never been a huge burger and fries kind of person... until Delux.  They have a relationship with Niman Ranch (vegetarian fed beef) and their Delux burger is so good.  I kept telling myself I'd venture out and try something else, but outside of going for sushi, the Delux burger always happens.   It has caramelized onions, bacon, gruyere and bleu cheese and arugula.  I order it... bleeding.  It's soo goood.    The fries come in a fry cart!!! It's a little itty bitty shopping cart you can wheel around on the table and you can get fries, sweet potato fries, or both!  And it comes with a dish with an aioli on one side and ketchup on the other (there's a divider in the middle, don't panic).  They have my favorite lambic framboise, they have a 4 Peaks beer flight (kilt lifter, hop knot, sunbru kolsh), and a Sweet Street flight that included my beloved framboise, with another local favorite, Papago's Orange Blossom, and Crispin Cider.  They offer other flights and a custom option, and I love the selection.    I came here for sushi once with a friend.  We sat on the left side.. the sushi side.  They were playing episodes of Samurai Champloo on the walls.  The sushi was good, it was standard.  Like it was good quality if you want sushi but nothing stood out.  When I think Delux I still think burger.  If you wanted a burger and your buddy wanted sushi, or vise versa, this would actually work out really well.  So go here because: 1. Delux burger. 2. Beer! 3. You get to play with a fry cart 4. It's open late aaand 5. Reverse happy hour.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Delux is a reliable late-night dining and drinking destination.  For us, we were pretty hungry after watching a Spring Training game, and there weren't a ton of late-night spots.  Luckily, this place is open until 2am, every day!  And, luckily, it reminds me of the movie Tron, which I love, inside, with neon blue lights all up in your face!  Between the bf and I, we ordered the delux Burger and the Standard Classic Burger.  If you tell them you want it cooked medium-rare, they actually know what that means!  Pink and tender on the inside, light brown on the outside, and soooo yummy.  We also shared a beer flight, which was pretty cool, and some \"a la cart\" fries, which are presented to you in a mini shopping cart.  Convenient, cute, kitschy, yummy, along with a side of good service.  I recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Service is excellent.  I was greated right away and felt very welcomed. Very cool vibe as well.  I had the classic burger..... can't go wrong with that.  Is a must try."}
{"text":"Food is more 3.5 Stars, but I rounded down because of inconsistent service. Don't get me wrong though, I'm definitely a fan of this place.   I've spent quite a few brunches here nursing hangovers with great burgers, amazing mixed fries (they've got the best sweet potato fries in Phoenix), and...flights of beer. HAH. For half-awake, hungry, and indecisive folks like me on a Sunday morn, a beer flight is THE way to go. They've got some pretty decent brews too-- a lot of nice crafts from all over the place with token AZ beers like the Papago Orange Blossom and the Four Peaks Delux brew thrown into the mix. (Note: A lot of the hip, trendy places in Phoenix seem to have their own Four Peak brew...but they all taste the same!).   The burgers, once regarded as the best in Phoenix, are delicious behemoths jumping on the gourmet burger bandwagon of 2007 but falling just a little bit short of greatness. I typically play it safe with the original Delux burger cooked medium well. If I ask for medium, sometimes it's just too darn rare. They've got a mean Turkey burger, and some vegetarian options like a 3-cheese panini and veggie sammy too. The menu is simple, but the servers are not. Sometimes waiters are spot on; legitimately earning those tips with friendly and efficient service. Other times, you don't exist. The good thing however, is that they do offer take-out so you can just bring that awesome meal on home.   Oh, and if you're contemplating a cookie for dessert...DO IT. A simple and scrumptious way to punctuate an already indulgent meal."}
{"text":"We came for the sushi but they don't serve it until 4 pm a little disappointed I'm not  going to lie the food is alright my daughters burger is a little too pink for her liking looks like she is going home hungry We have been back since and the food was great ."}
{"text":"This place by far has the best burgers ever!! They are such good quality, made with such fresh ingredients. None of the food tastes old or processed. It's sooo good!!! Every-time I am craving a burger and some fries. I always order from this place. I have gotten the Delux Burger and the Classic Burger in the past and you can't go wrong with either one, such great flavor! Oh the fries are amazing as well. They always give you good portions. And the prices are amazing for high quality of food you receive! 10 out of 10! Definitely recommend! Everyone who I talk to about this place loves it and so do I!!"}
{"text":"Bomb place to come eat if you want a great panini!  Also has great sushi and the milkshakes are great."}
{"text":"I've been a few times in the last couple of months and have had an enjoyable time. I think the best part is that their kitchen is open late, sometimes that's are to find in the area. But their food options are a bit pricey for what you get. Service has always been wonderful and the Deluxtini is dangerously good - it comes with the shaker so it's like 2 drinks in one."}
{"text":"Great late night spot, with a great burger or a DELICIOUS chicken panini! A shopping cart full of sweet potato fries tops it off!  The service was a little slow, but it is what it is for a busy late night bite to eat.  It is a bit loud inside, but good for them for having that much business in the state of affairs today!  Overall a great place for a fun quick night out!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend brought me here for lunch yesterday, and talked about just how good this place was.  When it comes to burgers, I firmly believe that they should be held as their own separate food group, right along with Pizza, Beer, and Burritos....so you can only imagine how excited I was to try this place, as it was voted Best Burger in Phoenix Magazine.  There was no wow factor.  None.  So, to anyone who reads this review, please tell me what I am missing?  Because, to be honest with you, all I tasted was a piece of unseasoned beef, on a bun, with some fresh tomato, lettuce, and red onion.  What set's the place apart?!  What makes this place amazing?    The only thing that I can say that was good about this place is that they didn't use the same interior designer that Blu Burger does."}
{"text":"Delux is a very 'sceney' late night bar/restaurant.  I like their sweet potato fries, but I'm not a fan of much else there.  The buns they use for their sandwiches/burgers are, in my opinion, of poor quality and texture.  They need to use better bread/buns."}
{"text":"A local told us about this place, and they were right! With fusion being the new trend. this place got it right. I like that they have separate kitchens which is a brilliant idea for so many reasons. Burger was awesome, sushi was decent, drinks were STRONG! Look forward to coming back. Special thanks to Stephen on his professionalism and knowledge of the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing burgers, salads and the mixed basket of fries keeps me coming back! Not to mention they serve their menu until 2am! Bonus!"}
{"text":"Burgers aren't horrible....   mine was very under cook (asked for medium, I got rare) server was nice but in all... there still a greasy, flat top cooked burger! And it was $50 for 2 beers 2 burger and SHARED fries! (Although the order of fries is HUGE). And lastly hopdotty is in NORTH Scottsdale... Much better burgers and much less expensive"}
{"text":"OK, drove all the way from Gilbert to Camelback because the Phoenix Magazine rated Delux as one of the best burgers in the Valley. Two burgers, one mixed fries, one lemonade, one Diet Coke and tip came to $39. Fries were very good but because of the poor service it's hard to say how good our cold burgers were. Susan had to ask one of the other servers where our order was because we didn't see our waiter... everyone around us was getting served and they ordered after us. Too bad, we probably won't go back because of the service. I'm sure if they could make all the pieces fit together the place would be great. Just don't want to pay almost $40 for a couple burgers and take that chance again. We'll go to Burger King or McDonald's where we know what to expect."}
{"text":"Awesome gourmet burger restaurant! The Burger / Sushi menu is unique and evening I've ordered has been great."}
{"text":"Took over an hour and a half for one tray of sushi And then gave my party food poisoning, had to keep asking for our check so we could leave third time was the charm. definitely will never recommend or go there again"}
{"text":"If I'm in the mood for a fancy burger, this is where I go.  Parking is hard to come by, but its always worth it!  I usually get the Delux burger & sweet potato fries.  LOVE them both, especially with the aoili sauce.  Their aoili has a kick to it so I usually put it on my burger too.   Great for lunch, tons of beer on tap for dinner/happy hour.   Its worth mentioning that this restaurant is on the small side.  There's also quite a bit of bar seating.  With one (maybe two) long tables through the middle of the restaurant sometimes you sit right next to another party.  Its not a deal breaker, but if you're looking to have a personal or intimate conversation bet sure to get a table."}
{"text":"Delux restaurant located on the very hip ossington strip is a wonderful eatery.   Everything there is done to perfection with subtle modesty.  The interior of the restaurant is warm, welcoming and tastefully decorated.  Castor design type lights hang in the entrance way, giving the place an instant funky industrial look. On the right side of the wall hanging over some cozy booths is an interesting Technicolor alphabet light installation which some how does not look tacky at all.  There are some random industrial, metal chairs throughout the bistro.   I really enjoy the design and atmosphere at Delux.   They achieve an ambiance that is contemporarily chic and cool without it coming across as being contrived or pretentious.  Service was excellent, our server was very knowledgeable and an obvious foodie.   I ordered the Steak Frites and it was delightful.  The meat was cooked to perfection, was very tender and flavourful.  The French fries were delicious.  I was very pleased with this meal. For dessert we tried the donuts that were freshly baked for us.   I felt like Homer Simpson having a love affair with the dessert.  Prices range from $10-15 for tapas, $19-30 for entrees which all incorporate a classic French style cuisine.   Well worth the price for such delicious flavours.  Spend your hard earned bucks at Delux.   I highly recommend Delux!"}
{"text":"Michael helped my waitress with my table during a busy period and was absolutely amazing! got the delux burger and it was great! A great place to grab a burger!"}
{"text":"Cool burger and sushi place. Interesting combination but it works and it's nice to have the option. Service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere is very hip and modern. I liked the blue lights on the tables. Best part is they serve food late and happy hour starts at 10p! We ordered sushi from the happy hour menu and it was delicious and affordable. Great drink choices too! Most likely be coming back when I am around the Phoenix metro area to try their infamous burgers!"}
{"text":"On one of my Scottsdale excursions recently i got taken to Delux by a friend who said they make, \"the best burger she has ever had.\" So obviously i had to put this to the test.We started with sweet potato fries which were served in a mini shopping cart which was entertaining. They were cooked to crisp perfection and lightly seasoned and still had the incredible sweet potato taste. I got to try the clasic delux burger itself and it was quite amazing, incredibly juicy and cooked just how i like it. We also got the lightly seasoned original fries as well which were just as good as the sweet potato ones. i also got to try the turkey burger which was also juicy and flavorful, along with the chicken panini which was incredibly tasty.  it was a great lunch every one i was with enjoyed themselves and I am glad my friend recommended it."}
{"text":"With a week left before this place shutters its doors I doubt this review will make a difference. Anyway here goes after snagging a last minute reservation we made it here on a Friday. I had looked at the menu already and sorta had an idea I was going to order. Here is a the verdict 1) Corn Cakes. Very good. Nice bold tastes with corn nibbles grilled to perfection.  2) Confit chicken wings. Hmm I haven't had chicken done in a confit before though I do like duck confit. This one faltered and didn't add much to the dish. 3) Duck Confit empanadas. I was looking forward to this dish but this was a sad jumble of odd tastes. Raisins and olives just didn't gel well.  4) Grilled chicken. Very good though the portion is ridiculously small. Even though its sold as a main course I would say its half portion. The plantains served on the side were quite good pity they only had 3! A good dish marred by the portion size. 5) Grilled shrimps tostone. Decent dish with bold flavors.  6) Fresh doughnuts. Served warm so that was good thing as I am not a fan of traditional styled one's.  Overall I would say 3 stars as some dishes were quite good.  The house beer didn't do it for me though the cocktails looked decent."}
{"text":"In my opinion Delux has the best burger establishment in town. I no longer live in Phoenix, but every time I am back there (at least once a year) I make a trip to Delux!   1.) They have great burgers & awesome fries  2.) Decent beer/spirits/wine selection  3.) Nice staff and hip environment  4.) A great place to hit up after a show, or late night sporting event  If you're just visiting the Phoenix or live in the area, I definitely recommend hitting it up and giving the signature Delux Burger a taste test!"}
{"text":"Outstanding! We love it! It's my boyfriend's favorite burger and they serve his favorite beer!! The sweet potato fries are delicious. I love love the aoili! I put it on my fries and my burger. Cool atmosphere, just go here.    I don't know why some people are uppity about it being in a safeway shopping center. That doesn't bother me one bit. FYI uppity people its also in the same plaza as the super high end Molina Jewelers."}
{"text":"Best burger in the valley, and the only burger that is actually worth it's $9 price tag out of any of them.  Great selection of beers to go with your meal, my mom loves the Beet Salad as well.  OPEN LATE!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good.    Is it the best burger in AZ?  Nah.  I'd rather have Zinburger any day.  Way more flavor."}
{"text":"horrible service. we didn't even get a chance to order dinner because a server never came by.  sat for 3 hours with two appetizer platters and then they refused to split the alcohol on another bill for me. Then when we got the bill they had forgotten to tell us that their credit card and debit machine was not working and I had to walk down two blocks to get money to pay for the bill.  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"We came here on a weekend day, and it seemed ideal before we arrived: sushi for the boy, burgers for me! Well, they don't serve sushi all the time, only certain hours. So the boy was forced to eat a burger and I felt like I let him down by not noticing that when I looked through the Yelp reviews before going. The (regular) fries in the cute little cart were tasty! I liked my burger ok, but it wasn't my favorite burger ever. We'll try to come back sometime when they do sushi too so my guy can get his fix."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went for the cute shopping cart of fries. It was a good serving but the fries were not impressive. We had the Duo mini burgers, and it was lacking in flavor. Burger was cooked well though.  Overall, we were disappointed at paying that much money for a non-flavorful burger and fries.  My fiancé also had their sushi, which she said was good. The seafood used was fresh and that did have flavor. But we probably wouldn't return just for the sushi."}
{"text":"It's time to come to terms with today's reality.  Delux still makes one of the best burgers in town but they have priced themselves completely out of my range.    I recently went for a lunch break.  I ordered a Delux burger, side of fries, and a beer. The burger was really good.  The meat was excellent as always.  The bread was a little bit too soft.  Id like a little more crispness to it.  The fries were good but they were not full pieces.  Most of them were fragments of a fry.  The beer was great.  Now for the pricing issue.  The burger was 12 bucks, the fries were 5 bucks, and the beer was 7.  With a tip I was just south of 30 bucks.  For a burger, fries, and a beer!  You have to be kidding me.  Even if the food was perfect, which it wasn't, I would never drop near 30 bucks for this meal again.  The place was unusually dead for lunch but after getting my check now I know why.  Sorry Delux, you may have a great burger but you have officially priced yourself out of my range.  You will be missed."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff.   The hotdog was amazing. It was supposed to come on a pretzel bun but they brought it on a sesame bun so that was a bummer. It still tasted amazing.   I tasted my sister's Delux Burger, that was a life changing experience. Cooked to order, juicy not greasy.   There were no complaints from the rest of the party about their food (Classic Burger, mahi mahi sandwich).   The regular fries were the perfect crunchiness, as were the sweet potato fries.   It was a little dark, but if nothing to complain about. And if you like bathrooms, this one is neat. Very modern, but more importantly-it's clean."}
{"text":"I'm super curious about how this restaurant came to be. I have two theories. One is that somebody just LOVES both sushi and burgers. The second is that they're trying to satisfy couples or groups where somebody wants sushi and somebody else wants burgers, and they're gonna please both. I also wonder if most people order both or stick with one. Of course, because we were there, I had to order both.  I was really just expecting both foods to be mediocre at best. It turns out that both were quite good. I appreciated the options of smaller burgers and 1/2 fry orders (plus mixed sweet potato and regular!!!).   Props to people who can mix bites of burger and sushi...I found it easier to finish the burger/fries and then have a sushi \"dessert.\"   This place is totally weird, but it works for me."}
{"text":"Consistent.  Great chinese chicken salad and best beer selection.  No one does sweet potato fries better."}
{"text":"Faded Glory. We used to live nearby, and so qualified as regulars.  They deserved their reputation then, but now I'm afraid that they're living off of it. Disinterested server, no water refills, and we waited and waited after ordering.  When we looked back toward the kitchen, there must have been twenty plates waiting to be served, with the manager standing there, and no servers!  And my burger was overdone (they tend to do that if you order anything beyond rare).  And my wife described her sushi as bland. Too many other choices to bother with this one."}
{"text":"I have always had their burgers and have absolutely loved them! I've been eating here since 2013 and absolutely LOVE their burgers.   Last night I tried their sushi for the first time. I honestly was skeptical about trying it since I just associate them with burgers. I'm so glad I did! I ordered the dragon roll and jalapeño yellowtail to go and it was super delish!"}
{"text":"I mostly come here for the sushi which is awesome. However if you get the chance to try their sweet potato fries I would highly recommend it, the best sweet potato fries I've ever had. The staff here is nice and the food is really good, never had any issues here."}
{"text":"Love the Chinese chicken salad delicious and a must have. Decent burgers and beer selection. Have always had great take out service and at the bar. Will definitely be back. Love their late night hours till 2am. Probably one of the only restaurants open that late in my area."}
{"text":"Looked like a nice place in the beginning.. went to get seated, walked by cooks and saw a prep cook with his mouth about 3\" away from the toppings used to make the food acting like he was eating/licking the product while talking to another cook. He was doing this for at least 15 seconds or more.. Commented on this to the staff, they could care less about it. The wife and I abruptly walked out, not even a sorry or anything from management.... This place new employees that take a little pride in there jobs, when working with food your standards should be higher. Wont be back.  Wish I had a picture of this, didn't think that fast, would of made my complaint more satisfying.."}
{"text":"Suchi was great. Awesome place to grab a late night bite."}
{"text":"They shouldn't even get a star, I just had the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. I ordered my food at 10 and was told that it would be 30 to 45 mins. That's fine because I was coming from my friends house 45 mins away. When I get there I was told that my food wasn't ready, I didn't mind waiting what I thought was going to be an additional 10 mins. About 30 mins later I get my food after two tables got their food and 2 people that ordered take out. 3 sushi rolls don't take 1 hour plus to make. This place has good food with a mediocre service"}
{"text":"The place was a nice relaxed place to eat. Environment was laid back. Host and waiter were both friendly. Our waiter was excellent.  Had a burger and it was good. Nothing great or different. But tasty none the least.  Would return. Might try the sushi next time"}
{"text":"I've heard all the hype for years and this place turned out to be precisely what I expected; overblown nonsense that wishes it were in Manhattan.  We came here late night, post dinner rush around 9:30pm on a week night.  Sat on the patio. Had horrible service; slower than molasses in January in Anchorage Alaska.  Our server (if you can call him that -- he was more like an entitled lump expecting a tip), Christian never came back to check on us, offer refills or ask about dessert. I had to practically ambush him like a guerrilla warrior to get him to bring me the check. After that we waited another 10 minutes for him to run my card, even though the patio was empty.  The food was OK,but nothing memorable or extraordinary.  I'd sooner eat McDonald's Dollar Menu burgers then spend money here again.  Just a waste or my time and money."}
{"text":"Late Sunday night and everyone was hungry and we wanted burgers and sushi and tacos haha everyone was craving something. I look on Yelp on what's opened now because it's 11pm on a Sunday and this place comes up. So we said why not it has a lot of reviews and 4 stars is good for all those reviews. We get there around 11:45 and it was seven of us so when the guy asked us how many he knew it was a struggle because at nearly 12am this place was packed on a Sunday. He told us only outside is available for our party of seven which is fine they provide heaters so no ones really cold. We order Sake bombs and sushi and burgers and honestly for what I had on my own was good. The tiger and Vegas rolls were good. The tiger roll is more on the spicy side and a Vegas roll everyone should know what that is if you eat sushi. But they did lack on service they slacked on coming back. But for a party of seven shouldn't you give us more attention than a party of 2? The waitress was cool when we threw some drunk jokes out there she started to laugh and comment back. Also outside its impossible to see your menus you have to grab the candle or the flashlight on your phone. It's got a nice feeling it to it tho. I like the place the foods good they just need to work on service especially being such a busy place. Also very small and bathrooms are cool haha."}
{"text":"Having travelled the high seas, near and far, east and west, I have yet to find a burger to satiate me the way the delux original does.   Thank goodness this place is still around since my college days or else I would be very sad visiting Phoenix. But why would this place go out of business, which we often have to worry about, even with the best places.   Now, the sauce that comes with the fries is also something I miss with a fierceness. I believe they told me the recipe once but I forget. Can anyone refresh my memory? Pretty please. Ok, that is all for now. Oh, and if you are ever in the South Bay in Los Angeles visit fathers office, it is quite similar. Ok back to eating. Bye."}
{"text":"Delux, you are the Gayest of burger restaurants.  I say this because of the propensity for gay clientele to fill your swank space.  Also because the overwhelming desire to be trendy and coming across as trying to hard seems to fit as well.  That being said, I feel a little glitzier every time I step through your doors.  I am going to go with a Pro/Con for the rest of this review.  Pro: -The fries are pretty darn good.  Smaller and thinner than many places.  I'd recommend getting half sweet potato and half regular.  They come in a shopping cart which is adorable.  Best part is the chipotle mayo that comes on the side. -The beer list is extensive and full of local brews.    Cons: -The menu is a little small and comes with only two types of burgers (three, if you count the turkey burger). -The Delux Burger is just ok.  I have had it three times now and each time I am satisfied, but never thrilled.  I find myself having to slather generous portions of the chipolte mayo on it to make it better.  For 10 bucks, this burger should be stellar and it just isn't.  Like most of the burger places, it is better to come with many people so you can share the cost of the add on fries.  Delux certainly is worth going to, but I would rather go to Zinburger or Fez if I am craving beef."}
{"text":"This review is for their Sky Harbor Airport location: What the heck Delux!  I order your awesome sweet potato fries and not until they hand me my order do I find out you do not serve the fantastic fry sauce here! Wtf? Really? That's why I got the fry's in the first place! I had to walk over to Humble Pie and get some Ranch! Yuck! Bring your dipping sauce to the airport please. No sauce, no more patronage from me. Bummed out!"}
{"text":"Loving this amazing food.. Burger \"delux burger\" on point!! And sweet potato fries in the shopping cart hella cute, and also tasty!! Roll fresh and solid serving size not skimped that's for sure!"}
{"text":"It has probably been a decade, since I have frequented this business, and I asked my coworkers if they wanted to go here for lunch last week, as I have heard great things about the veggie burger here.  My coworkers stated that they used to go here for lunch once or twice a week, as it is close to our office in DTP, however after back to back instances of poor service from their server, they had stopped going.  We opted to give it a go again, as they all rave about the Delux Burger, and I really wanted to try the veggie burger.    Food:  The veggie burger was unbelievable, topped with caramelized onions and all the other fixings, and the half and half fries were just as amazing as I remembered them.  My colleagues have never had complaints about the food there, and they stuffed their faces with their burgers as well.  I also had a vanilla shake with caramel, and while it is pretty hard to mess up a milkshake, it was magical.  Service:  We had a server by the name of Mandy, and she couldn't have been more attentive to us.  Given that my coworkers had described some less than stellar past experiences, we couldn't have been more pleased with Mandy, as she was the opposite of what they had previously described.    We will be putting this place back into our regular rotation, due to this awesome lunch experience."}
{"text":"Just read the \"restroom\" issue & I had to add my SONG of praise to the restrooms here! I could have fallen asleep and this was lunch on a weekday. Candles, blue paint, calm, ahhh. And yes - the burgers are unreal, plus they sold my crazy friend one of the mini shopping cart condiment dispensers!"}
{"text":"I really love Delux but for such different reasons then a lot of other places I love. My favorite thing about them is that they are open late every night! I recently moved to this part of town and it feels like every decent food place closes down by 10, especially on weekdays. Sometimes I get home from work at odd hours in the early am and since their grill is open to 2am I can call in and pick up a delicious sandwich on my way home. One thing I have to say is some of their food I dislike. I love their chicken panini and chinese salad. Their sweet potato fries are also awesome. Their burgers and sushi are like 3 star quality and some of their drinks are rather weak. But hey, I go there and get what I like and I am super happy every time!"}
{"text":"Really not that good, very over priced for how mediocre the burger is.  People kept telling me it was one of the best in town so I had to check it out since I love burgers, but really not that special.  I would prob never eat here again.  If you want a much better burger for the same price, check out zinburger or the windsor."}
{"text":"A lot has already been said about the food here, and I don't think I have much more to add.  However, in my opinon Delux makes a huge mistake...since when was it cool to take away everyone's privacy?  I went here with a client, and was almost afraid to say anything confidential because the next patrons over were only about 6 inches from my face!  Ok, they weren't that close but it felt like it.  At one point the woman next to me actually chimed in on a comment I made to my client about the drink I was having!  I think it's arrogant for Delux to think their food is so good that everyone will gladly sit on each other's laps in order to wolf down a marginally creative burger.  The bottom line is that you shouldn't come here if you want one shred of privacy to talk with your companions.  If you're alone however, this might be the perfect place to make some friends!"}
{"text":"I sadly have never been to Delux before until tonight.  There's not much to say that hasn't been already said in the 300+ reviews.  Delux is good, atmosphere is cool, service is great, and if you sit at the long high top'd table you will make friends with the people sitting next to you.  Their Sweet Potato fries are bombDOTcom....the aioli that comes with them is amazing, I would put it on everything if I had a bottle of it at home.  Had the Delux Burger...flavor wise it had everything going for it, and everything that I've heard people rave about.....BUT 1 thing: it was madly overcooked, kinda killed it for me.  I normally get my burger's medium, but I know you should get the Delux burger med-rare, so I sprung for it and it came out close to well done :(  It's the only thing holding me back from giving it that extra star...."}
{"text":"Great service but food wasn't so good! If you want nice friendly and responsive service, this is the place. If you want a nice sit down restaurant with clean and open decor, this is the place. If you want unique flavorful food at fair prices then this is NOT the place!  Our waitress was nice friendly and all the staff was responsive. Awesome! Nice decor, comfortable and open, great place for a date or romantic dinner. However the food wasn't that good and overpriced.  We ordered the: Pressed Cubano ($10) - grilled cheese and ham sandwich, broke all my rules for a meal, bad carbs, processed diary, and process high sodium meat but it was really good like a grilled cheese sandwich to be.   Flat iron steak with chimichuri and crispy shallots ($19) - told that we should order from the middle section for the entrees but this was smaller portion than pressed sandwich. Was not falvorful at all and very chewy. Again, very small portions, more of an appetizer than an entree.  Black Beans ($6) - spiced black beans. Wasn't too bad but really, a side of black beans for $6? Beans are so cheap.  Lucky my girlfriend was eating on the drive here!! This is probably just too much for one person but not enough for two hungry person. If they can just get the food from Oddseoul next door than it would be a perfect mix of great food, great service, and great ambiance. I don't recall ever having Cuban food, other than the beans it doesn't taste that different from food at other restaurants.

{"text":"Let me preface this review by saying I am enormous Burger fan, I love them. I eat at least 2-3 a week, no problem and it is absolutely safe to say that I would choose a cheesebuger as my last meal on earth.. I once called In & Out my true love, but last night my friends, I met someone new and have fallen hard... his name is Delux, and he is amazing.  I arrived here really late to meet up with friends, so I didn't spend too much time inside.. and I never actually saw a menu, but from what I gather, the place is totally popular based off the amount of people and the wait I was told about, also that they have a great beer list (also a full bar) and some wonderful orange special sauce that you definitely need to dip your french fries (and whatever else) in. The interior reminded me of something the wonderful Chef Barbara Lynch would do. The Butcher Shop in Boston is very similar, aesthetically anyway. Since I was late and it was packed, I didnt get to order, so I just want to extend an enormous thank you to the wonderful Georgie S. for sharing with me the most amazing burger I have ever had. In my life. Hands down. I was in meat heaven last night, and the fries were freakin' awesome too, served in a miniature shopping cart no less. Top that off with a Makers on the rocks, and you have one, very happy Nikki.  In & Out... I would like to apologize for cheating. I still love you Animal Style #2, but it was worth it, I am in love and I now have a new favorite."}
{"text":"Delux is a definate staple in the Phoenix food scene.  This is one of the better establishments in the Phoenix area.  If it is your first time heading to Delux, I would start with the Delux Burger itself.  This is a very good burger that is best served the exact way that it is spelled out on the menu...including the medium rare serving temperature.  Trust me, I am a medium temperature on my burgers (the only thing that is not red), but the juices that flow through this burger are unbelievable.  Start the table off with a basket of mixed fries (sweet potato and regular fries) for every 2/3 people there.  Well 2/3 hungry mid-20s men.  If you want to venture away from the burgers on the menu, I suggest getting the grilled cheese and adding chicken and bacon to it.  The chicken sandwich is pretty good, but the grilled cheese is better.  The restaurant is definitely cool inside, and the patio is nice.  This restaurant is busy, but never seems to be longer than a 20 minute wait time.  The bar is cool, and a great place to grab a few beers.  They always have something new and exciting on tap, so ask for a draft list and enjoy something cool and refreshing."}
{"text":"the crowd is def of the 'i'm hip and sexy\" variety, but if that's not your scene, you're not going to feel out of place... when i got  attitude from the 16-year-old hostess  and i scanned the patrons i was like \"oh, great, it's gonna be like THAT,\" but i easily struck up a conversation with the table next to us when my company left me alone for several minutes to go to the bathroom (kind of impossible not to eavesdrop when you are practically bumping elbows and you have to pull your drink away from the edge of the table when someone needs to get by so their rear end or purse doesn't knock it over).  all that said, the burgers are delicious and the fries are amazing (get the mixed order if you're not sure about the sweet potato fries, bu i guarantee you'll love them with the chipotle dip it comes with).   the ground beef is organic and the delux bruger features applewood bacon-infused patties and gruyere cheese. not the place to go if you want a ton of options - the burger is the star and you have a choice of two. i did have one of their salads and it was very good and very big.   one friend who tried it did not like the baguette-style bun, but that's the only complaint i've heard on the joint.  on to the really important stuff -- booze. i take it back, the menu is huge, but that's because they have so many beers! including one of my favorite \"special treat\" beers, Framboise Lambic (raspberry dessert beer). they're milkshakes ain't too shabby, either.  yes, i'ts a little cramped in there, but it helps off set the very chicly-designed look and cool baby attitude to seem more like a chatty, happy diner... you know? except this diner doesn't have smashed fires on the floor and a gum-chewing waitress."}
{"text":"Best burger in town & great atmosphere!!  The owner Lenny came and greated us at our table when we were here. He made sure we had a great experience..something that is hard to find these days.  He truly has a passion for this restaurant.    The beef on his burgers comes from a small farm in northern Cali and is free of all the crap that comes from factory beef... and it tastes amazing!! The sweet potato fries and regular fries are very tasty too.  We also got the Kale chop salad, which was also amazing.  The atmosphere is very cozy here too, not loud, not too upscale, not to busy...just perfect.  I love all the booths too.  We will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I arrived before my friend, so the hostess was going to seat me while I waited.  I looked around and my first impression was that it was very modern decor, very trendy.  The tables to the left were along one long booth bench, then had a chair across from it.  There was a long table in the center with BOLTED stools along it, and then there was the bar.  The only table left was next to a couple with two very loud toddlers, and since the tables were so close together, we'd be almost sitting on top of each other, I opted for the long center table.  After sitting there for about two minutes, I was looking for somewhere else to sit.  VERY uncomfortable.  When I friend arrived, she sat there for an even shorter amount of time and said the same thing .... we have to sit somewhere else.  There happen to be a table open (a few down from the toddlers) so we opted to sit there.  Again, the tables were soooo close together, that we had to move the table over so that she could get through to sit down!    Now for the food ...  we happen to order the same thing, the Cool Caprese Panini.  As other reviewers have said, if you want any sides, they are all extra.  Since the panini was already almost $10, we opted for no sides.  The panini was very good, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and some kind of herb paste (I think).  The warm grilled roll was also very good.  It came with a small container of vinegar/oil, and two separate cups with salt and pepper.    It came with some fruit, about 5 small pieces to be exact.  If I were really hungry, I probably would have hit the vending machine when I got back to work.  Forgot to mention, it was FREEZING in there.  We sat close to the door, and it actually felt good when someone opened the door to let the 105 degree air in.  So, if you not very hungry, don't mind over paying for what you get, and don't care if you are comfortable while you are eating, you might enjoy this place."}
{"text":"How I miss Delux.. the best damn burger I have ever had.  I love how they bring you the french fries in little shopping carts, do they still do that?  While living in Phoenix for a year I became a regular at this place.  Get a burger and then go do your grocery shopping next door at Safeway.  Hope this place is still serving up the best burgers.  I didn't bother reading the other reviews before posting my own, so not sure what my fellow yelpers are thinking, but it's a solid 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Perfect place to stop in for a late night dinner. I ordered the mix fries (French fries/sweet potato) and the delux duo (2 mini burgers); both very solid. Saw online they offer a reverse happy hour on food and beverages, however I only saw a happy hour drink menu at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I loved everything about this place except the location.  I was a little drunk from a wedding when I visited & all I could remember about the location was that it was in a strip mall next to a Safeway supermarket. No Bueno!    Get past that & there's no turning back.  The atmosphere draws you in like a moth to a flame & then curiousity strikes....it looks like a bar so will their food taste like 'bar food'?? Nope, not at all!!  I had a delux burger, sweet potato fries, a red velvet cupcake for dessert & a martini (I forget what's it's called) to wash it all down.   Ahh...that's the stuff [food] dreams are made of."}
{"text":"went to delux for a date today and had the best time, the environment was great, the service quick and helpful, and as always the food was the best in town,  we ordered a burger and sweet potato fries with a flight of beers and it was the perfect meal to hold me over until dinner. Perfect place for an intimate date or a lunch meeting (seats both accommodations perfectly)"}
{"text":"Ok people lets stop being sheep here. Delux is nothing but an extremely overpriced low quality burger place. People are stuffed in here like cattle. The fact that so many people rave about Delux is just another thing I dont understand. I tried this place twice, (I will always try a place twice in case they have an off day) and I was very very disappointed both times. The burger I ordered was $11. ELEVEN DOLLARS FOLKS!!!!! No burger no matter how incredible is worth anywhere near $11. And of course this did not come with frys or anything else. The burger was kinda mushy with no flavor at all. The bun was very plane and did not have the best texture. I also ordered the sweet potato frys and did not like them at all. That was the first time I had ever had those so it could be I just dont like that type of french fry. The second time I ordered the regular frys and they were pretty undercooked with no seasoning.      This place proves my theory, if you make it snooty enough everyone will think its good matter how bad the food is. Delux is nothing but hype. If you want to try a real burger with great flavor and a descent price try Lenny's on Thunderbird and 35th ave. That's what a burger should taste like."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere with anime playing in the sushi bar. The food was good but not worth the high price. Happy hour pricing is higher than most sushi places and the sushi and rolls are only fair. Friends ordered a great basket of fries. The best thing you can say is that they are open to 2 am and have some good craft beers"}
{"text":"ATTENTION Single Ladies: Attracted to corporate-types that like $9 burgers? Like a man in a suit who isn't afraid to eat french fries from a tiny shopping cart basket? Like that frat-guy-turned-accountant who enjoys a good beer while seated at a cobalt & chrome underlit diner counter? Like a man who knows what color cobalt is?   If you answered yes to any of the above questions, then let me direct you to Delux. One more tip: go on a weekday at noon. The diner counter/table will be full, with maybe two seats available between two possibly good looking businessmen.   Oh, and the burgers (I had a turkey one) and sweet potato fries are delicious, just like almost all the other 186 reviews have claimed.  Go forth and enjoy the food and midday eye candy."}
{"text":"I definitely recommend ordering the Delux burger -- I can never finish an order by myself so I end up sharing it with my BF and order a basket of mixed fries with it. The flavor of their aioli is so perfect with the fries -- I always ask for an extra one.   Surprisingly, their salmon sashimi is one of the best I've had in AZ! So fresh, so unexpected from a burger place. Stop by on happy hour for their sushi.   I ordered the Delux burger protein style once, and that was a little bit disappointing. Nevertheless, this is still a neighborhood favorite. I stop by once a week to satisfy my Delux craving!"}
{"text":"The Delux burger lunch special with mixed fries is amazing! Special runs from 11:00-4:00 pm 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Great service ! One of the best Sushi place in town . Love how you can just come late and grab something to eat . Kind staff and lovely location."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was also great. Indoor seating is at long communal tables which isn't my thing. It was not above average so I'll try another place before I come back."}
{"text":"yeah, use to be awesome. but maybe not. i don't really remember. i think i just always really loved the super strong martinis.   otherwise, overrated. completely. but, recently i did come to learn that the hot dog here is better than roosevelt. which is saying a lot."}
{"text":"I love Delux! The sweet potato fries are to die for! So are the burgers, the caprese salad and the veggie panini. I've never really had an outstanding server, maybe because the place is always busy and crowded, but as long as they watch my drink levels and get me my food, I am fine. The Banana Split dessert is fantastic...they even give you a side of hot chocolate syrup to pour over the ice cream--and I dont even care for chocolate that much. I usually do lunch there, but have had some nice nights out with friends munchin on fries and drinking Hefewiezen draft beer."}
{"text":"We took other people's advice... The shopping basket of mixed fries were perfectly seasoned and delicious!!! The spicy tuna was fantastic but the Las Vegas roll was the BOMB. We've had sushi everywhere on the planet and this roll in particular was superb. Those were the appetizers, we thought, next time we'll wait to order dinner because that was so much to eat that's all we needed!  Then we had the turkey burger and Chicken salad and yet again, we were in taste bud heaven and positive we'd go straight to hell for such yummy pleasures! The ambiance is really a cut above some top Vegas nightclubs. Really great place to go for a meal, a drink and so happy it's open late!"}
{"text":"Wow.  I really had thought I'd already found the best burger in the Valley.  Then what happens?  I find myself out in the Biltmore area to study and *BAM* there's Delux.  Can I resist trying it?  No.  No I cannot.  Right when you walk in, I was struck by the 'cool' factor they have going on.  Dark paneling and blue accents, as well as an awesome long blue table in the middle.  It's not a big place, and I can see it would be easy for it to feel really cramped in there.  Luckily, the lunch crowd had dwindled, and my friend and I had enough space.  Sweet potato fries?  Done.  I was wildly amused that they came in a little shopping cart.  They are also served with side of ketchup and some some of vaguely-Cajun rémoulade.  They.  Are.  Awesome.  And then my burger came out.  I really think I heard a choir sing.  They win huge points for presentation here.  The colors they use to accent their burger are truly masterful.  It helps that the burger tastes awesome too.  And, truth be told, we went back that evening after the coffee shop gave us the boot for a post-studying drink.  We got to sit at the big blue table and enjoyed some of the many, many beers they have on tap.  It's a great place for a meal or a drink.  Now if only they had a quiet little corner I could put all my books out on..."}
{"text":"They have duck on the menu!  If there's duck at a restaurant, I must try it, and here, I'm super glad that I did!  This is a low key, dark restaurant with some seriously tasty food.  I came here with Catherine L for the Telus Tuesday Special, which by the way, was an amazing deal.    We started with the oysters and charcuterie plate.  Delicious!  The oysters were so fresh and the charcuterie was the right amount of saltiness and quantity to make for a light and appealing appetizer.    The aforementioned duck was crispy, juicy and all round awesome.  The black cod with mussels was meaty and perfectly done.    For dessert, we both had the creme brulee which tasted like it should.  If it wasn't for the deal, the bill would have added up quite a bit.  Also, it's not the place for big eaters to come and expect to be full.  I was pretty satisfied, but I know bigger eaters than me certainly wouldn't be with our choice of the menu.  The service was good.  The bathroom is located down a steep flight of stairs with single self-contained stalls.  The restaurant is bigger than it looks on the outside because there's an entire back area that is separated from the front of the restaurant by the kitchen.  The only complaint I have really had nothing to do with the restaurant, rather the difficulty I had getting here via public transportation.  The Queen Street West streetcar is notoriously unreliable.  On the way back, we waited over half an hour  even though the ttc text system said it would take 10 minutes.  A better alternative is to take the Ossington Bus which starts at the Ossington Subway Station and goes through to Liberty Village and back."}
{"text":"I tried this burger for the first time last night.  I took them up on the medium rare recommendation and was not disappointed.  The bun was very light and crisp and served to complement the burger, so the emphasis was properly placed on the burger itself.  The fries in the shopping cart were a nice creative touch.  They were solid aside from the presentation.    Allow for extra time to park, as the lot is incredibly crowded."}
{"text":"Tuesday is opposite day.  Or is it Thursday?  I don't know anymore.  I'm bored with reviewing at the moment, so I'm going to write this as exactly the opposite of how I actually feel (save for the star rating, which I will rate accurately so I don't mess up the average).  I'll let you do the decoding.  Delux is awful.  I hate that they have Arrogant Bastard on tap.  Their cheeseburgers are a huge step down from Applebees, my personal favorite.  Or maybe TGIFridays is my favorite...life is full of such difficult decisions.  Anyway, the french fries at Delux remind me of deep-friend cardboard: flavorless and tough.  When my server accidentally spilled an inconsequential amount of fry sauce on my twenty dollar jeans, he didn't give me 30% off.  Oh, and I hate the decor too.  I'm not already planning to eat here this coming weekend."}
{"text":"Came here before ever trying Zin Burger. I had heard through the grape vine that this is the restaurant that zin burger was modeled after. Absolutely delicious.   I had the Delux Burger. MMMM....The flavors of the meat, the onions and cheese came together in perfect harmony. Sweet Potato fries were cooked perfectly. All in all  the food was amazing.  Service: Our server was pretty knowledgeable but had a bit of an attitude upon learning that I had never been there before. As if I should've known what to order before hand.   Décor: Pretty and modern but it smelled kinda musky in there. Like a grandmas house.  I really like this place and will absolutely come back"}
{"text":"Some co-workers and I decided to try this place out. It was ok. It can get very crowded during lunch. They recommend their hamburgers on the rare side, a little too rare for me being hamburger. The sweet potato fries were good. Its small and kind of has the same vibe as FEZ or SWITCH. Probably more on the Switch side of things with all the blue decor..."}
{"text":"I have had my fair share of burgers and I can confidently say Delux has the best burgers in the valley. I have heard their paninis and salads are great, but if I'm going to Delux, I'm ordering the burger.   I have been to Delux several times and their extensive beer selection, creative drinks, and consistent great service makes their experience just that much more enjoyable.   There are hundreds of reviews, so see them for details regarding the atmosphere and specifics, but I can reassure you their burgers are the best.   Brett is the most attentive, pleasant, and knowledgeable server I've had at Delux (July 2010)."}
{"text":"Had the Delux with it's arugula and onion/bacon mush (for the record, if you're going to but bacon on a burger, it NEEDS to be in CRISPY, BACON-STRIP FORM), and I have to say I was immensely unimpressed...flavor was lacking :/ The french fries were ok, sweet potato fries fared a little better.  Häagen-Dazs choco shake was rich and super chocolatey (make sure you have some water on standby!)    That pretty much does it...probably won't go again.  Wasn't terrible, but was far from great.  I'll still get my late night/early morning burgers from Whataburger, yup I said it, Whataburger."}
{"text":"ehhhh... as a 2nd time visitor to phoenix i just gotta say i wish there more late night eateries open around 130am.  that being said, this place was ok.  sure the burger was pretty good, but damn, $11 to go?  also, i woulda thought they had a larger burger selection, but they didnt.  it was actually rather disappointing.  what was impressive however was their beer selection.  they had like a billion beers on tap.  anyway, they should rename this place \"land of a 3 dozen beers & 3 types of burgers\"... the current name is misleading!"}
{"text":"More like a 3.5* but i'll round it up...because our group had fun here.   Dinner: - Salted Pear Cheese Salad: the salted pear was so different but yummy - Cubano Pork Sandwich: done perfectly; crunchy, crusty and yummy pork - Steak Frites: the steak was good, but i wouldn't call it the top 5 steak in TO. Good fries...but maybe a little too much  Overall, reasonable prices, yummy meal."}
{"text":"Just OK. Food was decent, but not great. Atmosphere is middle of the road. We've been here a few times, and we always ask ourselves why."}
{"text":"Mrs. Ambiance and I went to Delux after the Chelsea Handler show this evening and their burgers were much more complex than the comedian.  Cool place, especially late night.  The long blue table in the center seems to be the place to be.  They tried to sit Mrs. Ambience and her sister (the really pickey one) out side, well, that did not work at all and we moved to the long blue table.  The food was just great, comfort food for late night.  Shopping basket for the fries is a great touch.  Early morning tomorrow, so could not fully ReTox."}
{"text":"Date Attended: 11/05/14 (Carryout)  Item Ordered: Delux Burger and Mixed Fries (my portion of the order)  Price : $18  Service: The staff allowed us to split the bill several ways for the five people that ordered carryout. Inside the restaurant,  the staff appeared very attentive to the guests.  Atmosphere: From the outside, it looks like a very cool place to eat with the neon blue lights. The patio was spacious and inside was on the dark side.   Food Quality: Here's where the ball was dropped. The burger was definitely on the greasy side as evidence by the accumulation of grease on the bottom of the takeout container. Interestingly, the beef patty was on the dry side. Despite this, I think I would return and try the Classic Burger, which is on a brioche bun (looks great). The fries were too thin (personal preference), but tasted great.  Overall Experience: The atmosphere definitely shined more than the Delux Burger, but will return to give it another try."}
{"text":"I'm excited there's sushi at Delux, it's a great add-on to what is an already good late night eats resto. It would be wrong of me to not be appreciative of their burgers, especially the Delux Turkey burger. It's one of the few places I've been to where the Turkey burger comes out moist and not dried out, and served with a really good cilantro and garlic aioli. The fries (they have both regular and sweet potato) served in the mini shopping carts is a great concept, and the micro brewery they have makes Delux a good place to grad a bite and enjoy a brew. As for the sushi, it's decent and does satisfy any late night cravings since they have reverse happy hour from 10 to close daily. It's a good eats kinda place and one of my late night favorites, it's worth a try."}
{"text":"This is a really great burger joint and I have always known that.  I stopped in with my wife the other day for a beer and a burger.  I noticed they had a \"hot dog\" on the menu.  Being German ancestry, I could not resist ordering it just to see how a classic burger joint works the hotdog.  THE THING WAS AMAZEBALLS.  I really loved it.  Of course, I got a cheeseburger as well because I would not have slept if I didn't get a burger there.  As always, really great service, great atmosphere, and food that satisfies.  Will be back soon"}
{"text":"Delux is the shitz!  Great service, diverse menu, tasty food, and kitchen that stays open till 2:00 am! Now that's what I call competitive advantage. If you like burgers get the Delux burger! You can't go wrong. I am mostly veggie so I enjoy the basket of mixed fries (that comes in a little shopping cart I always want to steal) or the veggie panini.   Their banana split is epic!   Pros -kitchen open late -good food -owner is nice -great service -awesome deserts -fast service  Cons -small outside seating"}
{"text":"Please don't use Jamie C's review as a deciding factor as she has also rated Jack in the Box with 4 stars.  No wonder you had to add salt to your burger.  And gross.  Anyway, I've only had great experiences here especially when I get off of work starving and this place is the only restaurant in the area smart enough to stay open late.  Service has always been friendly...then again, I know how to be respectful and not wave my hands in the air like a total douche.  See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the fact they have the option to sub bun for burger to be wrapped in lettuce. Basket of fries are amazing.. 2 thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"This place takes a unique approach to date night. Ever have a girlfriend or boyfriend who can't decide between sushi or a burger? Well guess what! Delux has your back! Delux is often raved as the best place to get a cheeseburger and I can't say they are wrong. Ever heard of Zen 32? Well they moved into Delux and the same sushi can be had here.  They have a large beer selection of at least 40 beer taps. They also have a large cocktail menu and wine menu. The happy hour is generous and lasts from 3pm-7pm.  I purchased the double mini burgers and there was nothing mini about their flavor... DELICIOUS. My girlfriend got the low carb sushi and she said it might be the best sushi in Phoenix, and she is HARAH, when it comes to judging sushi.   We got the Sally cake for dessert and boy was it a great choice. I came for the chocolate but I left talking about the icing. So good and I highly recommend!  Last but not least, the experience is probably the best part about this place. The owner walks around the restaurant and greets everyone and you can tell he loves the restaurant he has built. He is a phenomenal guy and loves to talk to the customers so don't be afraid to say hello.  All in all, a well deserved 5 star review!"}
{"text":"Most of the staff are excellent. The food is always great! I usually get the beet salad but I it would be nice to see a few more salad options. The passion tea is really good too and the fries are amazing of course!"}
{"text":"Neat and clean restaurant in a nice shopping center.  We were craving sushi and the reviews and location of this restaurant fit.  PROBLEM...when we arrived they informed us they don't serve sushi till 4.  We didn't stay."}
{"text":"I only go to this place for brunch or lunch to have their fantastic cuban sandwiches. Their service is so consistently poor though. It should not take you over an hour to order and eat what is essentially a grilled cheese and fries. We even try to call ahead and order and it still is soo slow.   A couple of weekends ago we went to have brunch. All the seats were full but there was not line. We waited at the door and nobody even greeted us for the 10 minutes we were standing there. The 3 servers just kept serving their tables and walking around us. After 10 minutes we just turned around and left ( I did notice the other eating customers looking at us almost understanding our frustration).  Good lunch if you can get service or wait long enough to get what you ordered."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite spots! Burgers are so juicy, fries are delicious with the special Aoli sauce, and the sushi is a huge plus. Doug was a fantastic server. He was very quick and friendly, even during the busy rush. Great food and professional service."}
{"text":"I eat here constantly when I'm having late night sushi cravings. Always good service and sushi is consistent. It's so clutch to be able to find a Vegas roll at 1:30 am. Also the mixed basket fries, amazing."}
{"text":"The sub sandwich of burgers. Seriously. I could only eat half and I can put it away.  The patty is just so thick, I couldn't handle it.    I must really need to get laid if that last sentence about a thick hamburger sounded sexual to me.  Anyway, besides the thickness factor, the hamburger was delicious-- medium rare, melty Gruyere cheese, bacon and onions cooked together in what makes a gooey, slightly sweet BBQ-like sauce.  I also partook in one of the beer flights... and then I partook in my friend's beer flight because I forced him to get one even though he doesn't like beer (Insuring that I would end up with two beer flights-- nothing in life is random, wait, everything in life is random... I'm confused.  How about nothing in life is random where beer is concerned?).  The sweet potato fries were soft. I like a little more crunch in my fry. Who wants a flaccid fry? Not me. I could bend them in all sorts of shapes, none of which were useful.    I think I liked the ambiance more than the food, but the food was good too. Or maybe I had too much beer and this review, tainted with sexual innuendos, is worthless. Either way, a must try.        P.S. I hope people I only know in passing never read this."}
{"text":"Disappointing & poor service! The two stars are for the burger only! Four of us came in for lunch and our waitress clearly did not want to be there. Was rude and unpleasant. The hostess also looked miserable and Mande our experience very uncomfortable. Being in the service industry one would think you would try to go above and beyond and that was not the case this time. Training is definitely needed here. As great as your burgers are, we have many choices."}
{"text":"Fabulous food, great prices and they are open LATE!  How did I not know about this place??!!  My fiancé and I stumbled on this cute little place while driving back to Phoenix from Scottsdale.  He ordered a burger and I had a salad.  Large portions, great menu choices and top-notch service.    I just love it when the manager works late, cleans tables and talks to the patrons!!  I've certainly included this place on my \"open-late-and-worth-going-to-when-sober\" list!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience here, and I was impressed. The decor alone when you walk in is stunning. My friend and I chose outdoor seating as winter time in Phoenix is just beautiful. From my understanding, this place is also a take on the former restaurant Zen 32, which served sushi. However, sushi here is not served until after 4pm and they also have reverse happy hour. From hostess to waiter, both were very attentive. We were promptly seated, drink orders taken, and quickly followed with our lunch order. I ordered the grilled chicken panini and my friend had the turkey burger wrapped in lettuce. Unfortunately, I opted to eat a bit healthier and skipped out on fries. Overall, our meal was delicious and portions were great for the price. I will definitely be back to try out there burgers!"}
{"text":"When I first came here, I was blown away by how amazing the burger was... easily the best I have ever had, and I've had a lot of burgers. The second time was almost just as good. I've been there a couple times after and things have just never been the same. It seems they can't keep their doneness consistent, some times medium-rare is rare, other times it ends up being medium-well. I hesitate going back because I don't want gamble on whether I'm going to be getting a good burger or not.  Oh and the sweet potato fries are amazing."}
{"text":"My new favorite salad in AZ is the \"Delux Chinese Chicken Salad\". It is so delicious! Its huge too. I can never eat the whole thing. Their specialty drinks are always on point too. I love Delux!"}
{"text":"The Delux burger is great and make sure to get the fries, especially the sweet potato fries. Service is always great. Prices are reasonable, go for lunch and the burger includes fries. Delux is on the rewards dining program so you get points and they are on the yelp program so you get money back."}
{"text":"Sometimes I just want a burger.  But normally burger joints aren't this swanky.  So after much campaigning from my brother, I went and tried out this small hangout near the Biltmore area.  And I left hooked, but not on the burger.  The inside is pretty small with glowing tables crammed together to where only a small group of people can fit (and even then just barely).  They usually play music you'd expect to hear at a club in Scottsdale with mixes of pop, hip hop and techno blaring on the speakers.  The crowd at the restaurant mirrors that feel as most of the people I encountered were very fashion conscious and sporting the bling.  As a whole, the atmosphere wasn't my thing, but for some in the chic crowd this might be to your liking.  Anyways lets get to the food.  I got the staple Delux Burger which is served on a baguette with and has a different (almost fruity) sauce to go with it.  It was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  Then I tried the one thing that might (I stress the word might) bring me back to this place.  The sweet potato fries and the accompanying sauces.  Talk about addictive!  I rummaged through my little shopping cart of fries in no time flat.  The fries alone were almost enough to make me warm up to this place.  In the end however, the noise, the slow service, and cramped feel of the place was too much.  Normally I always stick around to try dessert at a new place, but I constantly got bumped into either by the person sitting behind me or the passing waitress.  I had to constantly shout across the table to carry on a conversation with my bro and it just seemed like they were squeezing more and more people into the restaurant as the evening went on.  We'd had enough and didn't stick around for dessert.  Now to be fair, maybe I picked a bad day to go or my experience was highly unusual.  But I was sure that Sunday evening wouldn't be that crowded and one would think a restaurant's signature burger would be the one to knock your socks off.  Again, I just felt like I was suffacating at a crowded night club more than anything.  Not one to hold a grudge, I don't want to discourage people from giving these guys a try.  Judging from the crowds we saw it looks like it has a pretty solid following.  I just wish I'd decided to grill my own burger on the Foreman that night."}
{"text":"Turkey burger was so juicy. Sweet fries had the right amount of crunch needed and so f-ing tasty. Freaking delicious! Best tasting burger on wheat bread (thank goodness) and sweet fry lunch I've ever had."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here, after a craving for a nice pink burger set in.  I opted for the Delux Burger.  The meat was excellent, along with the bread, but the toppings were subpar.  The applewood smoked bacon was barely detectable, and there was a big glob of caramelized onions masking any flavor that would have otherwise been noticed.  It left the burger tasting a little too bland.  They should consider cutting the onions in half, and maybe adding some pesto or something in addition to the aragula to give it a little contrast.  I particularly appreciated the fact that they had Sonoran Root Beer on tap.    In a more negative vein, the food took forever, and the price for a burger, fries, and root beer was almost $20.  Definitely not a good value.  It's worth stopping by if you're in the area and you want a burger, but you don't need to go out of your way for this.  It's somewhat overhyped."}
{"text":"You know, when your on the go and in a hurry it's so great to find a place like Delux. Although, best known for their burgers, today we had the most amazing hot dog - on a pretzel bun - served with sweet potato fries and the biggest Chicken Salad Sandwich ever. The sandwich did not come with a side,  but our waiter, Steve, made it happen. How cool to be greeted at the door by Mark, the Manager. Everyone very attentive! Check out the patio too!"}
{"text":"A good burger and the best regular and sweet potato fries in PHX; however you need to provide good service.  The service is not as good as either Indulge, Zinburger or The Grind, and the seating is extremely cramped at peak periods.  The food is very consistent; parking can be a bit difficult."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite burger places...and it doesn't hurt that they make some fantastic martinis to go with :)  The sweet potato fries are the best in the city - if I say so myself (and I think I've tried them all).  Sometimes you have to wait here, but it is always worth the extra time."}
{"text":"The place is small but trendy.  It's always packed with good looking people and bartenders.  Good burgers and the fries are OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"1. Fries in a mini shopping cart(strange but cool concept) 2. sushi and burgers(it used to be no sushi, but now i love this concept, you could eat sushi and burgers, my favorite foods in one place. 3. happy hour(awesome deals, food and drinks0 4. open till like 2 am, when all other restaurants are closed Delux is still open) 5. BEST BURGER IN ALL ARIZONA, and probably one of the best i had anywhere outside arizona. theres a reason this burger keeps winning best burger in az. their Delux Burger is just delicious. The meat is melt in your mouth(make sure to order medium rare, otherwise you cant get the full benefits) two people can eat from one, and im a 6'1 guy so i could have enough with half. I would choose sweet potatoe over regular fries.   *****Once you try this burger you wont be able to enjoy others, as you will always compare it to this(just keep in mind, theres fast food, pub burgers and then there's Gourmet Burgers, Delux being gourmet; you cant put others in the same line.   AVG burger price: $11 fries: $5 or $6"}
{"text":"First things first -- this is some great food they're slinging over here at Delux. No doubt about that. The wife had a Chinese chicken salad, and I rocked the slider \"mini burger\" duo. No complaints whatsoever about the food.   Prices on the other hand? Not so much. My slider duo was $11.75 and didn't come with fries. That was another $3 for a half order. $15 for two sliders and fries? Ouch. Her salad was $10, which at least was a very healthy portion of salad. I also ordered a draft root beer, which was also delicious. That ran $3.50, and no refills. Nearly $20 ($18.25) for a pair of sliders, fries, and a drink? That's not cool.   Don't get me wrong. I don't mind paying for quality. And the service is fantastic. I just think you're paying a little too much for the quality at Delux. Protip: Get the half order of fries at $3. It's more than enough.  I'd come back -- as the food is that good -- but keep in mind you're looking at almost $40 for two (with tip) for a burger joint."}
{"text":"Great spot for late night munchies.. burgers and sushi, nice staff.. check it out... the beef is very lean and tasty.. haven't had the sushi there yet but will return"}
{"text":"Sorry. I see all the great reviews but tonight was a disaster. My burger was so raw, it walked itself to the table. The people behind us even complained about theirs. Maybe it was a bad night? It's a cool concept. Give it a try. I'm going home to pray I don't get ecoli."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I always go here when I'm in town - and always order the Caprese Sandwich and fries.  Best ever!  The owner is very attentive - he clearly cares about his restaurant and his customers.  Interesting ambiance (in a strip mall - but much nicer inside!)   Combination sushi bar and great burgers (according to the others in our group) is \"odd\" - but do NOT miss this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Delux is our go-to place after hours. I think the best thing about this place is that they are open till 2 am. For those people like me who love \"drunk food\" but don't want to go to Jack in the Box (LOL), this is the place to be!   Food is always good here. Sushi isn't top notch but it's pretty good. Fish is always fresh. My boyfriend loves the burgers here, especially the turkey burger. I love their lobster bisque which I believe is only available on Fridays. Their fries are good but I don't get the hype. The drinks are good too. I always have the deluxtini while my boyfriend gets the buddha beer.   Prices aren't cheap but aren't too expensive either. Service is good and this place is always busy on the weekends."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Grass fed hamburger or not... If I'm paying for an overpriced 12 dollar burger why the heck does it not come standard with fries.  Oh wait. That is $10 for an entire stash."}
{"text":"Found this place by searching on Yelp, and I wasn't let down! We came in for the sushi happy hour, the fish was quality for a fantastic price. I'm looking forward to trying out their burgers and other menu items, everything looks delicious, but we for sure found our new sushi night spot!"}
{"text":"As a long time Delux customer (I even have the 10% off VIP silver card) I'm sure to eat here almost a few times a month. You can't be the classic Delux Burger (medium) and a basket of mix fries.   I do want to say that over the past few months however the service has seem to have lost the personal touch and attention to detail I remember. Smiles and warm greetings have been replaced with sometime forgotten orders and rather robotic sever personalities.   Normally that would get a 3-star rating in my book, but there's a special place in my heart for Delux, so they still squeak by with 4."}
{"text":"My husband & I were at Delux on Saturday night for dinner, as usual their food was very good. I love the beet salad, it was so good. My husband had the turkey burger ,  Very tasty as well."}
{"text":"Visited with coworkers. Enjoyed the Chinese chicken salad and they enjoyed the beet salad. Fresh food, great service."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch last week after not having been to Delux since it first opened and couldn't believe why it took me so long to come back!  I enjoyed the lunch special of a $12 delux burger with fries - so ridiculously good!  The staff was beyond welcoming and truly makes me want to go back again quickly since they truly appreciate your business.  Nice atmosphere, amazing food and amazing service - what's not to like?"}
{"text":"My friend hyped up the burgers at Delux to a level that was nearly incomprehensible. Surprisingly, I liked the sushi here more than the burger. We ordered a Las Vegas roll on Happy Hour for $9 and it was one of the better Las Vegas rolls I've had.  The burger was quite good, although I wish there was more of a bleu cheese presence on the Delux burger. The sweet potato fries are also very good, better than the regular fries in my opinion.  I'll definitely be coming back for some sushi!"}
{"text":"Woah, this place is amazing! Tried three main things that keep me coming back...  1.  The Delux burger, simple and affective... The meat is fresh and melts in your mouth and with the Delux sauce, wowzers. I put that on every bite of the burger!  2.  The Chinese chicken salad, my girlfriend got this. This was HUGE and delish! It was so good the girlfriend was trying to finish but couldn't so we took the rest home.   3. The sweet potatoe fries come in a little metal shopping car and is delish with the delux sauce!!!  This is a must try for anyone in AZ!!!"}
{"text":"So this place really had the potential of being better but I think I miust have just gone on an off day. Unfortunately probably won;t be back in AZ for a while so they may never redeem themselves in my book!  We went for the beers and burgers and beet salad I had read so much about. First off, when we order the waiter tells us the fan is out for the night so theres no beer AT ALL.... they advertise their beer and burgers like crazy- you'd think there was a sign or someone would tell us before we were seated!  Anyways, the beet salad I got was very good. The beets and walnuts and arugula and all that jazz were crispy and refreshing and the dressing they use is very subtle so you can really enjoy those veggies. Also had the low-carb roll... it was good, but nothing special- served me right for ordering sushi at a burger joint. My boyfriend got the Delux burger. he LOVED it. the bun, the burger, the toppings- all of it was right up his alley and no wonder their burgers have been rated the best!"}
{"text":"I have been here so many times... to many to count in fact.  And I always resisted writing a review because there are so many already that I didn't think it would matter.  But last night I went to dinner there with Michael and a couple girlfriends of mine... we had a great time and the service was awesome!  Our server's name was Jaime and she was wonderful!  I just wanted to let everyone know that good service at delux is possible:)  Of course I got the delux burger and a basket of sweet potato fries... Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place is way over priced and not worth it. I will admit, I've never dined in, only gotten take out, but I've payed out the wazoo and wasn't ever pleased."}
{"text":"Great place, open late hours so it's more convenient for people who get off late from work, cause most of places are closed around 11 if so"}
{"text":"Great food, good service and respectful of the lunch hour.  I'll definitely be back as I now work nearby!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The only thing I get here is the Delux burger and sweet potato fries because they are perfection. Great atmosphere, employees are great, it is kinda pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Pretty awesome joint, except it left little to the herbivores. The potatoes are great, serving either french or sweet fries, the little shopping cart they come in is interesting (and confusing). good place to go in Phoenix when you got a hunger after midnight and Denny's just ain't cuttin it any more. sad though that it seems out of place in a strip mall sandwiched (or hamburgered i might say) between an Asian restaurant and a nail salon. awesome hip, feel, but packed at 1:30 am. the cranberry and white chocolate chip cookies are orgasmic by the way."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat when I am hungry at midnight!! They have a happy hour for sushi from 10-l to late night.. The place it's really cozy but it's really busy sometimes!!!"}
{"text":"All around great burger place with a martini twist.  I've been here many times and have to say it's a great place to drink and meet new people.  I highly recommend the common table in the middle of the place.  Service was great and the atmosphere is cool and hip. SWEET POTATO FRIES....enough said."}
{"text":"Delux is always really good, fresh, and it's a clean place too! I love the beet salad with chicken added. It's delish! My man digs the burgers and we both scarf the sweet potato fries. Love their dipping sauce that comes next to the ketchup, Ah-mazing!"}
{"text":"The Ossington strip has become quite the popular destination for foodies.  With crowd-pleasers such as Rock Lobster Food, The Saint and Yours Truly, Delux can be easily missed.  It doesn't have an eye-catching sign and is rather low-key.  The restaurant looks pedestrian but it belies an understanding of food that goes beyond its unassuming appearance.  Those in the know frequent Delux for the Pressed Cubano Sandwich, a duo of cider cured pork shoulder, ham, Gruyère, grainy mustard, cornichons, and red onion wedged between two immaculate, crunchy, slices of bread.  One couldn't ask for a more divine ham and cheese sandwich!  Having started with such a home-run dish, they continued to wow with their White Bean Cassoulet with a trio of proteins (duck confit, pork belly and Toulousse sausage).  This was a rich dish that probably shouldn't be consumed on a daily basis as the salty duck confit would surely max you out on your daily sodium intake and while the Cannellini beans soaked up a lot of flavour, I couldn't help but wish they were a tad softer than presented.  The Steak Frites topped with herbed marrow butter saw an evenly-cooked-throughout medium rare Wellington County with a uniformly-charred border that rivals the neatness of a crustless afternoon tea sandwich.  The fries are smooth even if a bit on the softer side which goes well with the creamy smoked paprika aioli.  To finish off the evening we opted for the baked-to-order Buttermilk Donuts rolled in cinnamon sugar served with a yin yang duo of vanilla-packed Chantilly and dulce de leche.  Part of the fun is licking your fingers from all the dulce de leche that you've smeared all over yourself from trying to get it to cling to these warm balls of delight!  If you haven't had a chance to check out Delux, there's no better time than now as they celebrate their five-year anniversary with a discounted menu - appetizers for $10, entrées for $20 and desserts for $5 until the end of the month.  The one caveat is that the drinks are a tad pricey, but there are plenty of cheap watering holes in the area for an after party or two post-dinner.  I'm already rallying up the troupes as an alternative to Winterlicious for round two!"}
{"text":"I ordered the traditional burger, with swiss cheese, cooked medium rare, with a side of mayo along with a half and half fry. My friend ordered an artichoke cream soup (options change daily).   Her soup came first. It was delicious. Had it not been about 110 degrees outside I might have been more inclined to devour it.  The burger had a cute stick in it that made note of the temperature at which I had requested my burger arrive. All of the extras were on the side, pickes, onions, tomatoes, and shredded lettuce (as a side-note, I LOATHE shredded lettuce, I think it is the bane of all greenery). The side of mayo was just enough. I immediately cut my burger in half, and it was cooked to as I had asked. It was juicy, the bun was nice and definately MADE the burger (more so than the patty combination that is expounded upon so much in their description that I couldn't even manage to understand if it might come with a side of gold bullion, bc it seemed to be THAT).   The fries were a combination of shoestring-cut sweet potato and average potato, served in a cute little metal shopping cart, low grease and cooked nicely. They came with a dish that had ketchup on one side and what seemed to be a mayo/chipotle combination on the other.  I took a peanut butter shake to go. It was good, but I could get the same at Sonic.   At this establishment you are definitely paying for the fluff-factor, a ten dollar burger tastes like a five dollar burger but comes with five dollars worth of accessories (temperature stick, shopping cart caddy, etc).   There is a lot more on the menu, so if you want to impress someone with a ten dollar burger go for it, try the soup though (it's only five dollars and a little more mouth-watering),"}
{"text":"As soon as I landed in Phoenix my boy took me here. Good job sir!  I got absolutely stuffed in the sushi, which doesn't happen often. I'm a big man.   Can't remember all the rolls I order, but they were all pretty good. I was however a little disappointed with the quality of tuna.  -minus 1 star  Overall though I would give them another shot to see if that was just not so great sushi night. It happens.   I really dig the ambience of the place. Great tables."}
{"text":"I'm not a hipster.  No really, I mean I should get kicked in the shins and then deported back to lame-world where I came from for being such a conformist.  So really, I should like this place right?  ...but this place just didn't do it for me.  The fries were delicious, but the burger was terribly bland.  Service was a little sluggish.  I give it A for effort though, as it was probably one of the cooler spots to chill in Phoenix.  I'm sure there's all this great culinary goodness that went along with making their burgers, but it fell short in flavor IMO.  You'd think that after my Camelback hike, I'd swallow every thing whole, but in the end... left only finishing 1/2 the burger.  Cliffs notes:  Ordered:  Delux Burger 3 STARS                   Basket of sweet potato fries 4.5 STARS (yummy dipping sauce) Price:  $9.50 burger, $6.00 Fries Service: 3 STARS Atmosphere: 4 STARS"}
{"text":"Delux has the whole french bistro dining thing down to a pat from food, decor to service. I'm not sure why I had been putting off a visit to this resto for some time now, most likely I was fearful of competing against the crowds that flock to this place nightly!   Anyways I'm certainly glad I paid no mind to that recently managing a couple of visits in the past few months. This spot is located on the tail end of Ossington near Queen and carries an industrial chic decor inside with the flourescent bulb fixtures hanging overhead, white cement walls to the awesome alphabet art installation that is situated on one wall. Service is charming, attentive and professional, definitely none of that too cool for school attitude that I was worried about.   I had the steak frites which was not as really well seasoned but it was tender to say the least-it's a flat iron cut which is not my favourite cut when I have steak in mind. The accompanying fries were knockouts, true bistro frites, crispy on the outside yet soft inside with the slightest trace of nutty peanut oil. On another visit I had the cubano which is truly an awesome sandwich, a tasty menage a trois between home baked bread, cheese and pork. Between expertly grilled bread there's molasses cured pork, ham, gruyere cheese, red onion, grainy mustard and cornichons-an explosion of sweet, sour and savory all in a few bites.   There must be some good bakers out in the kitchen because the homebaked bread I had to start and the bread in the sandwich was soft, sweet and had a perfect crust. Desserts are good and in-house made here, the cuban coffee creme brulee is a real treat as is the seasonal strawberry rhubarb shortcake. Wine list has some unique ones quite a few from niagara region.   Delux ranks up there with my favourite bistros in Toronto, it offers good value, great service and well executed food."}
{"text":"This is my 1st time here as service was amazing!!! And the mngr Casey recommended amazing food the Deluxe burger was so on point and the rain now roll sounds simple but still so awesome!!!!! All locals come on down!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, Excellence, Superior, Delicious, these words do not give justice to Delux burgers. I get orgasms in my mouth every time I take a bite out of their burgers. My only problem with this place is the crowded space. If there was more room, this place would be heaven on earth."}
{"text":"I went here last night with a party of 9.  I've been here several times before but this was the first time I got their private room.  If you want some extra room (they tend to really pack people in the main dining area) and if you want to make a reservation so you don't have to wait for a table (they don't take reservations); the private room is the way to go.  It seats about 10 people but the catch is that you have to spend at least $200 which normally isn't a problem if you go with more than a couple people.  The room itself is kinda cool but you can totally tell it is their office/conference room thingy.  They should really clear it out of all the office junk and make it more of a dining room thing.  It was pretty cool anyway.  Very private and quiet.  The salads, burgers and fries were excellent as always.  The sweet potato fries were a bit raw/undercooked which pissed me off but I didn't say anything because I didn't want to complain.  Our waiter was very friendly, quick and accommodating to our large party."}
{"text":"I give this rating based on four things  1) There hamburgers and caprese sandwich were very good.  2)The service was great.  3) Very mellow ambient qualities (music, lighting, etc)  4) The bathroom was awesome. I am not joking. If I were rating this place based solely on the quality of their bathrooms, they'd definitely get a five.  Gripes: $9.50 for a burger that doesn't come with fries. I think most people would complain about that."}
{"text":"Late night dining in the Valley of the Sun seems to be hard to come by so we where thrilled to find an option that serves until 2 am!  Added bonus was they have sushi ( and good sushi) until midnight and a reverse happy from 10-12.  We had a couple of the hand rolls and nigiri l, both were excellent.  We also shared the roast beef slider, they were impressive as well.  We had Tara as our bartender/server, she was amazing, great food and beer suggestions- we are going to be late night regulars"}
{"text":"Always loved this place.  Come here every time I'm in Phoenix.  This time I had a waitress that seemed distracted (yeah you, the one who was working this Saturday afternoon) And didn't smile much or was having internal conversations while she was dropping utensils and clashing plates.  She was preoccupied when she took my order and totally forgot my fries...wasn't even on the bill.  I don't know, when a burger waitress forgets fries orders she should be fired.  She apologized when I told her and she said she was just looking out for my diet.  Cute, but where is the incentive to come back?  I mean forgetting fries with a burger is pretty obscene.  She pissed me off so much I don't want to go back for a while. I guess my point is that service doesn't represent the individual but the restaurant as a whole.  If they hire people who have no understanding of customer satisfaction and they are no longer representing the restaurant but only themselves, then it means the restaurant is slipping as they are no longer managing service.  This waitress clearly was not representing the restaurant, or even aware she was working. The decline of good consistent service is a bad sign."}
{"text":"Service by Nick was prompt and friendly. Enjoyed the booth area in the additional restaurant area, for 2 go customers.  However, I would like this restaurant to look into colder beer and possibly frosted glasses. Beer was at a temp more common for wine.   The sweet potato fries were perfect.. Thanks."}
{"text":"I ate here the other day as a last minute \"I'm early for my appointment and am super hungry\" thing.  Glad I stopped by.  The seating? Meh. It's a bit crowded, and I sat at the community table. The purse hooks are nice, but sitting on a stool for an hour long meal was not good for my back, and my shoulders cried out in pain.  The menu is good; however, online they tell you if the soups are vegetarian/vegan. They don't mention it on the in-store menu. Good thing I'd looked it up, and that my server (Meschelle) knew her stuff.  I was in a bit of a hurry and not ready for a whole sandwich, so I got the gazpacho and an order of sweet potato fries.  Which come with ketchup and a house aoili, but the server let me know it had mayo in it, which means eggs.  So instead, she brought me ketchup and a nice mustard (they have 4 kinds) for dipping. I appreciated that a lot, and also her asking me about whether I wanted the goat cheese that came on my soup or not.  The fries? Delicious. Some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever been blessed to try.  I may come back just for those.  But then, I had my soup? Oh! It wasn't anything like what I'd imagined (it was way more chunky, and more like a tomato salsa than a traditional gazpacho), but it came with goat cheese and avocado on top, and it was to DIE for. So freaking good.  The service was excellent; my drink was always filled, food came out on time, and the check came out when I wanted it too, rather than too early or having to ask. The food as delicious. My only beef was having to sit on a stool and lean over a hot (because it was lit) table.  I'll be back with my partner for sure to try the burgers (her) and sandwiches (me)!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to come to for any meal! Always consistent with great food. My boyfriend goes for the sushi, and I always tend to lean toward their panini's or mini burgers! The baskets, or \"mini carts\" of sweet potatoes are awesome. Matthew is a great server- knowledgable with the drinks and food menu, he took time to answers all of our questions even thought it was a little busy in the restaurant. Only reason I give 4 stars is due to the noise level, if you don't mind a little loud atmosphere, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Had the duck hash brunch there and it was truly *fantastic*. The duck was seared along with crisp salty potatoes. A very nicely cooked rice and beans, grilled plantains and a light salad with a sliver of grapefruit all on one plate. Great place for dins too!"}
{"text":"oh yeah burger boiee! this place is always a great spot for a yummy burger cooked to perfection. for me, med rare with  some real redness, is only found here and they do it right! not too rare, but definitely very red for the medium and higher temp lovers. i got the standard classic burger with cheddar cheese and i totally forgot to ask for the onions to be grilled, so just lettuce and pickles. this was the best burger i have eaten in a while, and it tastes the same everytime i come back! i did try the sweet potato fries in the mixed basket and  i loved them and the shopping cart they rolled in on. there were 3 of us so we sat at the bar, about 10:30pm on friday and the service was superb! amanda was on task. i had the pear cider and was so enthralled with all the pretty pour toppers, i wanted to try every beer on tap, until i remembered i can't stand the taste of beer that tastes like beer...so there i was with my pear cider, tasting like a pear wine, sitting and starring at the shark, the devil, the animals and all those pretty enticing toppers. it made me feel bold, so i asked for a taste of the white chocolate ale, and yuckie...i was dropped flat down on reality...pooof! i do hate beer that tastes like beer, even if it has a hint of chocolate after taste. next time i come to delux, its all about the dessert menu! i was so full, as usual, that there wasn't room for dessert. but dang nab it! i had to see that there darn menu, and low and behold i couldn't believe my eyes...the delux banana split lava cake will be all mine, next time."}
{"text":"The absolute best quality burger in Phoenix hands-down. I've been going to Delux for over 10 years. The quality and taste is always consistent. Occasionally you'll get a new waitress or waiter or who is a little inexperienced, but they're trying their hardest. Whenever friends or family are in town and feel like a burger this is where we always take them."}
{"text":"My friend and I started off with the charcuterie plate... I love charcuterie so this was already a shoe-in for me.  I had the pressed cubano sandwich, which came with fried plantain chips on the side. I loved the sandwich - from the tender pieces of meat to the crunch of the bread to the whole grain mustard that they used.  The restaurant itself is small and cozy, and the service is friendly and accommodating. Our server really took the time to explain to us what each dish was and he always kept my glass full! I always appreciate that because it seems pretty uncommon these days."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, great prices. Late night happy hour is a plus.  Stephen was great. So many beers on tap. A great selection.   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Many changes going on at Delux. Lowered prices and fries now included with hamburger. Beer prices will be lowered soon. Better cook as food came out as ordered this time.  Remodeled inside after 20 years ...nice job.  New lunch menu coming with lower prices than dinner. Everything positive here."}
{"text":"Excellent burger and you can get it as a lettuce wrap and skip the toasted bun. Comes with onions and with the basket of fries or yam friends served in a mini shopping cart you get great spicy mayo. Nice wine list, good beers and a modern interior that makes the place ultra hip. A long island counter space runs down the middle of the room with mirrors and photographs lining the walls. Greta experience."}
{"text":"OH I have a craving and its Delux...in fact that's where I will be at lunch today!! Enjoying their basket of sweet potato fries and a Delux burger....no wait I will have a Beet Salad maybe to start...or the Chinese Chicken Salad....mmmm....yummy!! Get there before 11:30 or else you are screwed - first of all parking is crazy there....getting a table is next to impossible!! There is also a take-out counter side with a selection of pastries and RED VELVET CUPCAKES!! or Gelato Spot is across the parking lot!! =0)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot!!! Inexpensive and great food. They use humane farms so you know you are eating good quality meat that is raised properly. I love the atmosphere too as it is very unique. You will be addicted like I am! I like the Asian salad and the chicken panini the best."}
{"text":"You may have to wait for clearly some of the best burgers in AZ..or the west for that matter.. I dont really eat red meat, but every now and then..if worth it..I will shock my system.. Go ahead and cheat with the fries..they come in a cutesy shopping cart with aioli.. do it! My buddy had a burger....all engrossed with cheese and bun and sauce..I had to try it...it was orgasmic! BUT I love me some asian salad..and I ordered that after I inquired as to what it was earlier as it was delivered to the table next to me... IT is a huge salad.. huge!!! Yummy thai peanut dressing and another dressing on the spicier side comes with too... We sat in the middle..the long counter with blue lights.... we were seated on the patio..but the drip system...well, was drippy! So they happily moved us.. martinis and wine ... very good...staff very nice and accomodating..He even gave us a sweet little discount..I wont say why.., but he liked us.:-) ;-) .. but we gave it back in tip... My guy friend got a dessert next door...@Delux to go... looked yum...but I dont have the metabolism of a guy so I choose to not...."}
{"text":"OK I know this place is known for its burgers. But the sushi is why I go here. Chef Balo is on fire with his delicious creations. Great atmosphere and always delicious."}
{"text":"I'll admit it... I really want to be as gung-ho about this place as everyone else and maybe I will be someday. What this place lacks in taste (food, not style) it makes up for in atmosphere and design. I cannot express how overjoyed I was when I stepped in and was relieved to discover that this place wasn't some ridiculous Scottsdale scheme of making a \"burger nightclub\".   The best things on the menu are the fries, the sweet potato fries to be more exact. As far as burgers go, I've had better but that's not saying that the burgers here are sub-par at all; they're just not something to break an arm over like everyone raves. I think the aesthetic look of the place definitely makes the experience of eating there more fun as well as making it a great place to unwind with friends at 1:30 AM. The staff and bar are both great and definitely add to the chill setting that makes me want to come back for more.   Go there for the mood and the fries, but if you're honest you won't be so quick to hop on the \"I love their burgers\" train."}
{"text":"The Sweet potato fries are excellent and the burgers are huge. I tried the delux burger and was nit disappointed but could have easily split it with someone."}
{"text":"Probably the best burger in Phoenix.  Sweet potato fries are the best I've had anywhere.  Nice beer selection, too.  We go there at least once a month."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I've heard for three years since moving here that this place is the best. First off, it's pricey, the sushi was below average, and the burgers and chicken salad were average. Lastly, my rating doesn't take into account that we found a hair in our fries which the manager comped and apologized for. Atmosphere was dull, more like a diner with no ambiance. Overall not one of the four of us in our party said we would go back."}
{"text":"I visited on high reviews.  I think it's a little over-rated, but good none the less.  My burger was a bit overcooked, food was overpriced but the service was top notch.  Great service, exciting atmosphere (although a bit cramped).  I would go again with hopes of a better burger."}
{"text":"All I really want to say is that our server, Milo, was amazing!  Super friendly and attentive.  Oh, right, the food was spot on, too :D"}
{"text":"3.5 stars The food I can't complain about, I guess the overall experience is what brought it down.    The deluxe burger was very good but a little pricey.  Fries came out in a shopping cart accompanied with ketchup or chipotle sauce.    First walking in, it had this distinct nursing home smell,  I couldn't pinpoint if it was the restaurant or a diner at the restaurant.  The service is what brought it down.  It was soooooooooooooo slow especially when there were only a few tables to be waited on.  An improvement on the customer service would of  been better a better experience.  Maybe if the place was packed their servers would of been more on point."}
{"text":"I had real reservations about a sushi place that also served burgers. But I took a chance and am so happy I did! Sat at the sushi bar and got the Zen Citrus Yellowtail, Hot Sake roll, and the Delux Phoenix roll. All three were outstanding. Service was great. I got my choice between a free edamame or hot sake because it was happy hour (sake, duh). And the kicker was fresh wasabi.   I'm here from out of town but would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Who wants to eat a greasy bland burger with a thick bun (doubles the meat) with fries and pay $15.00 for it? If you said yes, then Delux is the place for you.   The only reason why I even gave it 3 stars was because it's one of few restaurants that is open until 2:00 AM and the interior is nicely decorated. It actually looked like a fun place to grab drinks but not the burgers. After reading reviews about Delux, I was excited to try a \"gourmet\" burger. Instead, I ended up with their \"Delux\" burger, which the meat was tasteless and overly greasy by itself. The burger was minimally saved by some of the savory toppings like grilled onions. The bun was grilled (drenched) with butter. We actually split the burger and fries and boy was I glad!   The day after my burger experience, my stomach reminded me that Delux is just not the place for me."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with their milk shake and sweet potato fries, can't forget the outstanding American cheese burger! The BEST!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic burgers, fantastic service...mixed fries with ketchup & aioli sauce is a must...   I wish they had a larger menu selection however what they do offer they do it well...  if in phx this is a must eat at lunch spot or late night grub."}
{"text":"I have always loved Delux and Zen but since zen turned to another place I am so exited that Delux now serves zen sushi. How can you beat killer fries, amazing beer, some sashimi, and saki... And if you are hungry after all that you can get the classic zen burger...  Best day ever!"}
{"text":"Will recommend this place to anybody that is a big burger fanatic!!! The patty here has to be the best I've had. So good. The fries are also awesome with the aoli sauce. Best burgers in Arizona !!!! Also had the Chinese chicken salad and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"My burger really was very good. I must say though... the sweet potato fries are WAY better at FEZ. You have to admit, Fez fries are hard to beat. I have only ever been for lunch so I can't say much about the drinks and what not. It's usually pretty busy, I try to go early or late. I have tried to do pick up and it wasn't my brightest idea. I had asked for my meal to be ready by a specific pick up time and by the time I got it, it was already soggy. Ick. I'll stick to dine in. So much for trying to beat the crowd."}
{"text":"My husband and I both love this place!  I've had the Delux burger and the standard burger.  To be honest I didn't really like the Delux burger.  I think serving a burger on a baguette is a bad choice. It was hard to eat and I thought it had a funny taste from the combination of cheeses and caramelized onions.  I also didn't like that they cut it in half.  The standard burger is a whole different story.  It is fantastic!  The quality of meat they use can't be beat.  I don't even order cheese on my burgers.  The meat itself is so flavorful it doesn't need anything else on it.    Every time we've ordered there our burgers always comes out at the perfect temperature.  I order medium rare and my husband orders medium well.  Usually when we order burgers at other restaurants   both of our burgers come out medium because the kitchen can't get the timing down for the two different temps, not at Delux.  My burger is always perfectly medium rare and his is always perfectly medium well.   The sweet potato fries are to die for.  Their always perfectly cooked and the dipping sauce they come with is awesome!"}
{"text":"Was on my way home and it was already 11:30pm but I was super hungry. I quickly searched for \"late night eats near me\" when I saw a burger joint open until 2am! I type in Delux and see it's only 12 mins away so I head on over. Man was I glad I chose this spot. I pulled up and saw the restaurant was quite busy so already I was feeling good about my decision. I decided to sit at the bar since it was open seating. The bartender (who I'm bummed I can't remember her name) despite being pretty busy still managed to take care of me in timely fashion. When I told her it was my first time she quickly gave me the rundown about the type of product they sold. I decided on the Delux Burger and an order of mixed fries, alongside my  Ballast Point Sculpin beer. My burger came out in a promptly fashion and from the first glance at it I was impressed. My first bite was out of this world! I was told to try the aioli that came with it and it made it even better. I was definitely impressed by both the food and service so I will definitely be going back when the late night hunger hits."}
{"text":"It's been quite sometime that I have been in, but the last time our server was kind of checked out.  Maybe I would come in more if Autumn was the only server. She's incredibly good at her job and very very attentive, without checking in too much. Just an all around great server.   also some days the food is great, and other days it's so so. I don't know. the sushi isn't my fave but the burgers and fries are good. The Caprese sandwich is the only thing that truly woes me."}
{"text":"Three words: Sweet. Potato. Fries. Burgers are amazing also, but I'm not a big beefy fan. Hubby is though, and he can't shut up about this place. I'll admit, the cute shopping cart in which the fries arrive is adorable. Yes, that's important. But if the fries weren't to-die-for, it wouldn't matter as much. But they are! Atmosphere is cool/trendy/fun - but not pretentious. Chef Matt is super cool - Hi Matt! :)   I've only been once, so maybe we'll move up to 5 stars after further visits. I believe it was a Friday afternoon, and it was packed. Word is out and they are busy for a reason, so plan on patience or plan accordingly for your visit here. But do visit! It's worth it."}
{"text":"For the longest, Delux had some of the best burgers in town. They still have good burgers but I'm not impressed with the staff, the wait or the prices. The classic Delux with bacon, mushrooms & sauteed onions is still my top pick on the rare occasions we go. I don't have to drive across town for a good burger with potato fries served in a mini shopping cart but if I'm in the area, I might stop in."}
{"text":"I always forget about Delux only because Zinburger is closer to me but I really do like Delux better.  I had their new hot dog option which was really good.  They bring out a bunch of condiments to add to your hot dog, although jalapenos are $1 extra.  The fries are really good too! I love the atmosphere here as well.  Our waitress was really friendly and super attentive.    The only thing I didn't like was seeing the owner \"scold\" one of the waiters, who looked new, in front of the customers.  I think that should be done away from the ears of paying customers.  I also do not like when you see a manager or an owner in house and they do not go to any tables to say hello or how was the food."}
{"text":"I love, love, love Delux!  It's open super late and that atmosphere is almost so hip it hurts. The Chinese chicken salad [I order it without chicken] is a crisp, nice, vegetarian option. Plus, it's served in a gigantic bowl with more than enough to share with a friend or two. Plus, the mixed sweet potato and white potato fries come served in a little grocery cart. How cute is that?!"}
{"text":"Yum!!!  I just wish it were... like three times its size.  I love their fries in the little shopping cart.... yum! And cute.  I love cute food."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to try this place and I shouldn't have bothered to drive out of my way to eat here.  Food:  I ordered the sushi since i've read on yelp that their is really good.  It was edible.  Most of their rolls have mayo so if you love mayo, this is your place.  If you don't, then you are pretty limited in selections.  Service:  OK.  My server was nice and didn't mess up my order but I waited 30 mins to get my 2 rolls when they weren't busy.  Ambiance:  Bleh.  It was so dark in there, I had to use my cell phone to be able to read the menu.  Not a deal breaker.  But it was so cold in the restaurant, I had put on my jacket and eat my dinner in it.  That is ridiculous.  Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Food and service are both great here with an array selection of draft beers. Small outdoor patio with a couple of tables. My friends were more into this place than me but the turkey burger I ordered was perfectly seasoned and tasty. I can't complain about the sweet potatoes fries either, dippin' in some aioli sauce - YUM!  The atmosphere is different here, with blue  lighted accents throughout. Futuristic feel vibe. Apparently they serve sushi as well. Burger/sushi combo is something I never pictured. Nice joint in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"When I want to splurge on eating out, this is one of the few places my boyfriend and I can agree on. I put up with the noisy, cramped, uber trendy dining experience just to eat a \"Delux Burger.\" Gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, smoked bacon & arugala with a side of sweet potato fries - yes please. That is one freakin awesome burger.   And the Banana Split Lava Cake - oh man. What a beast of a desert. It's WAY more than enough for two people...we couldn't even finish it. It's practically the size of a baby. Or maybe a small dog. I think I heard a few \"ooohs\" and \"aaaaahs\" from other patrons when it was brought to our table.  For everyone who complains that they've had cheaper, better burgers, I would really really REALLY like them to tell me where, exactly, those can be found. Seriously, I need to know."}
{"text":"Delux is good...it's just not as great as people make it out to be. They've got decent burgers, but they're nowhere near the best around. It's not worth a special trip to eat there, but if you're in the neighborhood anyway Delux isn't a bad place to eat.  You can tell they use high quality ingredients in the burgers, but the overall combination of flavors isn't out and away mind-blowing or anything. They are good. I could even say they're \"tasty\"...but I can't extend any praise beyond that. Also, for a place that's supposedly known for their burgers, I find it odd that there are only 2 burger options on the menu. Another note: if you want your burger Medium Rare, then order it Medium; or, if you want it Medium, then order it Medium Well. They have a tendency to undercook your burger by one level -- at least they keep doing it to me. The last time I was there, my (supposedly) Medium Rare burger possessed all the color and delicious slimy texture of red, raw ground beef. \"Mmmm....!\" (said with sarcasm)  The inside is narrow and cramped -- hardly a place to kick back and get comfortable. The service is okay -- not super friendly, but not over-the-top rude either. The fries are delicious though. And the beer selection is good. Overall, this place is \"just alright.\" I'm not a huge fan, but sometimes I'm in that neck of the woods and someone I'm with will want to go there. So, I can't say I'll never return...but I'm not looking forward to it. There are just so many amazing burger options in the Valley (SEE MY LIST), so I really don't see the point of going out of my way to get to Delux for their burger."}
{"text":"Delux has the best burger. no doubt in my mind (and there are many good burgers around).  However, I always order the same item when I come.  I always get the Delux burger exactly how they recommend it cooked.  Their prices are a little bit higher, but it is worth it for what I feel is the best burger.  The fries are excellent, great with the sauce, and the atmosphere is trendy and unexpected for a burger place.  I like that sushi is on their menu (for variety), but I haven't tried it."}
{"text":"Delux Burger: Median Rare (amazing) *they can also use lettus wrap instead of the buns. Sweet Potato Fries: Delicious (but dont take it home, its kinda gross after u reheat it.) Delux Dog: Great hot dogs, specially with their mustard. Mazzarella salad: ehhh not to crazy about it."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant; it had great ambiance!  I had the fish burger with sweet potato fries and washed them down with strawberry and peanut butter mike shakes.  All excellent!  Great service and the entire staff is very efficient, professional and friendly.  A very clean place with outdoor dinning."}
{"text":"There was a wait for a table inside (107 degrees outside!) so we found 2 seats at the bar.  This place has an \"LA vibe\" with the music, long drapey curtains, low lighting and candles.  I am an IPA fan so I had a flight of IPA's which were all excellent.  My wife chose a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc to go with the excellent homeade gaspaccio that had sprinkles of goat cheese on top and fresh avocado diced in, perfect for a hot day.  I had the Delux burger which was cooked perfectly and paired that with another beer sample this time the favorite was the \"Coconut Joe\" from Papago Brewing company.  My wife had a turkey burger on a whole wheat bun and paired that with \"The Big Red\" from Australia.  The staff was very helpful, allowing us to sample the beer and wine before committing to a whole glass.  Amanada helped my wife select lower calorie options as she is trying to cut back on calories but still enjoy eating out.  We recommend ordering the 1/2 order of mixed french fries which was still a very large portion.  The shopping cart of fries the the people next to us had was huge!  Be aware of ordering the chocolate lava cake as it is huge and for at least 4 people with 3 large ice cream balls (vanilla, chocolate and strawberry) with lava cake, a serving vessel of hot fudge to pour on top and at least 2 whole bananas!  Kimberly (the other bar tender) helped us pack some up to go."}
{"text":"Ok, ok....they earned it. I have explored most of the menu now and there is way more to it than just burgers. Chinese chicken salad, panini grilled cheese(!), grilled chicken panini, mahi mahi sandwich, Haagen Dazs malts, a few very good wines, fun beer combinations...all very bueno.   Plus now that I'm part of a group of regulars (that happen to tip generously, which may play a part in improved service), we get hella good service from our regular cycle of about three different guys.   Delux rules"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with a table of 4. It's a cute little place with a cozy feel. The staff are all very friendly and helpful and make you feel comfortable from the moment you get there.   I tried the cubano sandwich as an appetizer- split it with my husband. It was delicious! Definitely a very big appetizer though. My entree was a braised veal rib. The meat was so tender and hearty. My husband had the duck confit which came with some sausage and pork belly. I only tried one bite of his duck but it was perfectly cooked with lots of great flavour.   We also had the steak frites at our table and another braised rib.   For dessert we split the freshly baked cookies and the donuts. The donuts were amazing and the cookies were warm and gooey.   I will definitely keep this on my list of places to try again and again. They have brunch on Sundays which I might just have to try.   4 stars from me! NOM!!"}
{"text":"First time here, our server Patrick was very kind, attentive and helpful with suggestions. Even gave us 10% off the bill.   The Asian chicken salad was super tasty! Fresh greens. The sweet potato fries were delicious and crispy!! Rainbow and lollipop sushi were yummy as well."}
{"text":"The only place in this area that open late  The food is big enough for one person service is nice  The ppl are classy for local  I like the sushi and the burgers  Clean and cool music"}
{"text":"Following items on the menu are just amazing: Delux Burger  Turkey Burger  Chinese Chicken Salad Sweet Potato fries in a small shopping cart  The place is very clean, nice restrooms, trendy bar and the best thing is that they are open every day until 2am.  The only negative thing is that most of the time there is a waiting time (sometimes 30 - 45 minutes) and the other problem is that I really never can decide what to get. It's just too good..."}
{"text":"After researching numerous articles on the best burgers in Phoenix, it was noticed that Delux burger was on every one of those lists. I myself have been dying to try it for some time now and my bf happened to be having a burger craving last night. After some convincing, we went to Delux and for a small place, was so happy to be seated right away because it was 8pm and we were HUNGRY. The ambiance of the place is \"bar and lounge\" which to me was nice especially for a Friday night. However my bf wasn't initially pleased because of the dim lighting and the fact that he wouldn't be able to \"see his food.\" Let's just say that didn't matter anymore because his first words after his first bite of the Delux burger was, \"burger craving fulfilled!\" ... And after trying it myself, I was impressed. Definitely one of the best burgers I've tried. I got the veggie burger which was good, but I wish I had ordered the Delux burger as well! We also got an order of mixed fries (regular & sweet potato) a la carte (literally, in a super cute tiny shopping cart!) and was very pleased! My bf who also was not a sweet potato fan just became one because theirs were that good... And the aioli sauce it came with helped a ton!   Our server was more than attentive and we even got a visit and chat from who I believe was the owner which was very nice. We were curious to try the sushi that they recently started serving there, which the owner explained stems from his other restaurant, Zen 32.. But we will save that for next time because we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We mainly come when my wife is craving a burger with a milkshake.  Fantastic milkshakes  Pie Hole Porter -- sooo good!!!  They also have Lindemann's Framboise on top (raspberry lambic), which my wife loves.  Delux Burger is fantastic.  Try it as a lettuce wrap so that you can pretend it is somewhat healthy.  I really like their carmelized onions.  My only complaint is the 'bun' - it gets oddly soggy if I eat too slowly."}
{"text":"Excellent food, perfect burger, fries served in a shopping cart.  Go for the classic standard burger.  Perfect brioche bun, that lends to the perfect bite of very tasty beef and cheese.  I really can't wait to go back.  There is also a very good selection of beers on tap, each served in their respective branded glasses. Nothing more to say.  Just go and try it."}
{"text":"Rated #1 burger for a reason!!! I love their food!!! Don't miss this place. I never liked beets until I had their beet salad. Burgers are perfectly cooked. Mahi Mahi sandwich and Turkey burgers are also quite tasty. Don't miss the basket of mixed fries"}
{"text":"I always enjoy visiting Delux, their turkey burgers are the best. They have my favorite beers on tap, Abita Purple Haze, Papago Orange Blossom, and Rogue Hazelnut. The servers are always attentive and they are open late."}
{"text":"You are pretty much guaranteed a good burger at Delux.  That plus a hugeormous selection of beer and amazing service equals a great meal.  About the service, the last time I was there my waitress had a knack for knowing what I wanted before even I did.  That was impressive.  If I needed my drink topped off she was already on it.   Word to the wise, chances are you'll be sitting at a big long table with a bunch of other people.  So if you are looking for something more intimate, this isn't your place."}
{"text":"Here is why I have to give this place 5 stars.  My husband and I started making Delux our \"date lunch\" place every Tuesday a few months ago.  (see we have two kids and rarely get to eat without the little ones).    Since we go on the same day we've become familiar with a lot of the wait staff.  We prefer Bobby in most cases-super nice guy working his way towards medical school-loves to gab and gives EXCELLENT service.  He sees us walk in and comes to our table with two tropical ice teas in hand.  Usually we order the same thing-at least husband does-I like to switch it up so after confirming that my husband wants the usual he's off with our order.  Depending on how busy they are we chat with a few of the other servers too.  Since we are frequent visitors we don't even have to show our \"VIP\" card anymore.    Don't count out their turkey burger-I'm not a big turkey burger fan as they tend to be dry but this one is always delish.  The hot dog and chicken panini are also tasty and who can forget the Classic Standard Burger.  Hands down best sweet potato fries on the planet!  We love Delux and their super staff!"}
{"text":"I've had great burgers all over this country. I remember getting off a bus in the middle of nowhere, Nebraska and having an amazing burger (across the street from a slaughterhouse).   I was hyped about Delux, so I had high expectations.  The burger was great....however.....I could not get the idea out of my head that the place smelled like dead cow. Did it? I don't know, it smelled like something......died, maybe a cow....  I know that burgers are made from red meat (dead cow) but should the restaurant smell like it too? Maybe it's me, I don't know.......the burger was good though, AWESOME fries"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is a little too \"hip\" for me, but not bad.  Food is REALLY good.  Had an excellent burger, and sweet potato fries (Ta-HAY-STEE! - and served in a mini shopping cart).  Oh, and a chocolate shake as well, which was really good.  It's served with 2 straws, date or not, so there ya go.   No alcohol for me so I can't comment on that... but the vittles are top notch, yet at bar room prices."}
{"text":"We came here as a special treat--and we were not disappointed! I wanted Gazpacho. It was cool and flavorful, very satisfying. We had the Delux burger, mine with a lettuce wrap instead of a bun. Have you ever eaten in a restaurant that offered this option? I felt loved! This is an upscale sushi bar, too. We passed on this. The sushi bar was backed, near the ceiling, with six 42\" screens that showed bubbling water with a few sharks at intervals.  Our waiter was the epitome of professional--a real one! \"Folks, my pleasure, thank you very much.\" Decor was unique with the ceiling designed to muffle. Music was atmospheric, nice to hear. Perfect for fun, quiet, dining. A real keeper, this place."}
{"text":"Wow, overpriced, trendy, with below average food...  What a concept.  I've had burgers for half the price that are twice as good."}
{"text":"I had my second Delux burger.   It is tasty, but underwhelming given the price.  I also find the burger menu a bit limiting.  I think the price reflects the fresh and local ingredients, but I would prefer more choices, like Zin Burger...  Still good food though."}
{"text":"In keeping with my practice of no good reviews unless two visits, the Delux held up quite nicely.  Unfortunately, having tried both variations of their Burger (The Delux and The Standard) I did discover that the flavor of the Delux comes from the accompaniments and NOT the beef. This comes to light with the Standard, as without onions it does lack the \"beefy flavor\" one expects from an extraordinary Hamburger. Certainly a presentable and repeatable experience, although NOT sure it stacks up against other premium priced Burgers. Their late hours (open til 2:00 AM) are a plus forNightowls.  Biggest hit are the Sweet Potato Fries and the accompanying Aioli. FABULOUS, almost beyond adequate description. Plus the service in a miniature grocery cart is very cute!  Not the best of the Premium Burgers in town (See The Grind) but worth repeating occasionally."}
{"text":"The service was very fast and friendly. 40 diverse craft beers on tap. The delux burger is amazing and huge! The fries are so delicious and they come in cute mini shipping carts. Overall a 10. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm a Joker, I'm a Smoker ... I'm a Midnight Toker.  I usually pop in here with my Posse round' midnight. If you live in the valley and haven't inhaled a Delux burger with sweet potato fries ... well you just haven't lived!  Urban Cool"}
{"text":"Burger joints have been popping up everywhere making a good hamburger harder to find. This place is way over priced for just a basic burger ($12) with no sides. My boyfriend got their specialty and it was nothing too fantastic. I got the tuna and the bread overpowered the rest of the sandwiches. We shared the fries basket and had two sodas with a $39 total. Way too much to spend on a burger and fries in my opinion! I saw they had a sushi bar which just seemed out of place. I'm not sure this place knows exactly what they want to be either."}
{"text":"Take it or leave it. I left it and I'm set on that decision. Mediocre food, 'too busy for you' service, and some of the blandest drinks. Why? Because it's 'Biltmore,' and the suckers pay up for it. Been there, done that, don't like."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that marks itself as Cuban, the menu isn't a very good indicator that they're attempting to create anything other than hautely prepared french bistro-country food.  The dishes were all texturally and visually delicious, but lacked in flavor.    That's not to say the food wasn't excellent - but after basking in the warm ambiance of the cozy space, which has a rustic modern graphic-chic decor, I was expecting to be blown away.    The place was almost packed, but without that uber-trendy lineup, and the server was knowledgeable and playful, a plus for us 4 girls who hadn't seen each other in half a year and wanted photos taken and flirtations thrown around, giddy as can be.  He dealt with us well, and we never had to lift a finger to have our wine glasses filled.  One of our group is vegan, and he had no problem accommodating her diet by checking with the kitchen, who offered the vegetables pimped up a little from one of the meat dishes.  (it looked like a sad story of a meal to me, but she seemed ok about it - vegan is a tough subject in dinning that i don't want to get into).  The best part about the meal was a) the wine and friends, and b) the dessert of buttermilk doughnuts, which were the reason we chose Delux; a friend read an article where they were ranked as one of the top 13 doughnuts in Toronto.  There was a bowl of them, timbits size, and a bowl of Chantilly cream to dip into; a totally decadent and wholly unnecessary finish to our feast.    I'd go again but only for the ambiance, dessert, and perhaps some oysters - though they could be cheaper."}
{"text":"To remix the legendary \"Spinal Tap\" aphorism, Delux \"does for 'the burger' what 'The Sound of Music' did for hills\" - that is to make them bold, fresh, modern, and delicious.   Pros: Original, fresh menu - Great Beer selection (all microbrews from across the states) - Very stylish, vibrant, contemporary decor - and (an odd one) the bathrooms are incredible.   Delux boasts a fresh and clean aesthetic in the design of the space and the quality of its food. From burgers to sandwiches to soups, salads, and deserts, the quality and originality of Delux's recipes are evident from the first bite.  Everything I've tasted here (on my numerous visits) has been unique, and most definitely \"worth writing home\" about.   Entrees are $6 - $10 and served a la carte (sans fries or salad). Fries are available (in regular, sweet potato, or a combination), and are $3 for a half order, $6 for a full (more than enough to share). Known for their burgers, Delux also serves many other sandwiches and paninis including a chicken panini, a grilled cheese version, and a vegetarian panini(chock-full of deliciousness).  I've had just about every one, and they're all great. As an added bonus, the menu incorporates an extensive selection of beers from microbreweries across the US, along with a wine menu and a fully stocked bar.   But I think what really sets Delux apart as a destination more than just a place with tasty food is the design. Delux's design is fashion-forward, with a long bar-height table with diffused neon blue light emanating from it anchoring the room, repeating themes of mirrors and stainless steel, and numerous architectural elements to mirror and mimic the light around the room.  It's design probably steals elements from several nightclubs and lounges around town, and translates them into a unique and chic hotspot for dinner.  Con's: (only 1) Delux is a small restaurant which fills up quickly. Can be at least a 10 min wait if you have more than two people."}
{"text":"Great burger! The classic cheeseburger is great! Fresh buns, tender juicy meat and fries are great!  Milkshakes are delicious too!"}
{"text":"The BEST burgers, fries, shakes, and chocolate chip cookies in town! Never had a bad meal or bad service here."}
{"text":"When I lived in Phoenix I would eat here every day when my kitchen was being remodeled.  There was a time that my bodies DNA basically consisted of Delux classic burger.  Whenever I visit Phoenix I make sure this is a pit stop.  It's the best burger I've ever had.  I wish they would open one up in San Diego."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited tonight and we were not disappointed! I always ordered my burger medium rare and most of the time they mess it up, but not here. The Deluxe Burger was unique, juicy, and delicious! My wife got the sushi and she seemed to like it. Great selection of local beers ,and the fries were good to (brought to you in a cute little shopping cart). Very good place, will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Good food, had oysters then pan fried pickerel"}
{"text":"I had lunch outdoors at the Delux on Saturday (2/13/10) and ordered the Delux Burger. My burger (medium temperature) was undercooked and since the waiter didn't check to see how everything was tasting in a timely maner I asked for the check when he finally did take time out of his busy day to check on me. I was also pissed because there was a group of 8 people hovering next to me by the railing waiting for a table to open up outside. In short, the ambience does not match the hefty price of the meal."}
{"text":"I used to think that delux had the best turkey burger in the world.  Lately it has been mediocre.  3 months ago they would've had 5 stars but my experience lately has not been so good.  I order ahead of time and ask when I should be there, and this last time, I was on time but they weren't.  They did offer me an iced tea while I waited which was nice."}
{"text":"Delux? I think not. I expected to have an actual selection of burgers from a place named Delux. Unfortunately, they named the restaurant after one of their only three burgers. I wanted a barbecue burger, but they didn't even offer one...  Instead, they offered two beef burgers and one turkey burger.   I chose the Delux burger (I figured since they named the restaurant after it, it must be good), and it didn't even have any seasoning. It was bland, and tasted more like meat loaf than a burger.   The only redeeming qualities of this place were the fries and the decor. I didn't even like the dipping sauce that came with the fries that much. Very expensive for what you get."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and had a great experience!  The Delux Burger is delicious! Both the sweet potato and regular fries are fantastic.  Prices decent and service was great.  Love the bread for the burger.  Yum yum, can't wait to return"}
{"text":"The food and ambience was great as always. The service tonight was above and beyond thanks to our server Douglas!"}
{"text":"What a fun hip place for a burger and a beer on tap!  Everything I've had here has been great!"}
{"text":"First off, if you're a meat eater who appreciates a great burger, this is definitely a good place for you.  My boyfriend dreams about the burger with the bacon and the cheese.  So, 5 stars for the burgers.  But...  if you don't eat meat, there's nothing here for you.  And I've been about 4 times, I want to like them!  But, ick.  Their veggie sandwich is pretty much just mozzarella on bread.  And their fish sandwich is really weak.  There's just absolutely nothing memorable (except for the funny aftertaste) or interesting about it.  The fish is supposed to be marinated in some kind of citrus vinaigrette, but it's quite tasteless.  None of the salads have ever seemed appealing, so I haven't tried them.  I really wish they had a veggie burger, because I bet it would be quite yummy.    And their fries are okay, but they're skinny - and very fried.  But the sauces they come with are tasty.  They also have a great selection of beers."}
{"text":"Sunday fun Day.  I love trying new places  My friend and I went there on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.  First we thought about sitting inside, but the bar table we sat in was bolt down to the ground and has no back.  so we decided to sit on the patio, which was a much better choice  it was our server first day on the floor, she did good now on to the food..... i like the idea fries in a shopping cart basket, its cute...but it a pain when you get to the bottom and trying to fish it out of the basket for a $10 burger and the menu says best to have it med rare, i can do without the bun soak with burger juice (meaning red juice....if you know what i mean) i like to eat my burger with my hand....like the way it suppose to knife and forks are for some other food other then burger  over all, its a nice place for sunday afternoon i would like tell people if you like to eat your burger with your hand, then get them medium or even med well."}
{"text":"I thought I was really in for one of the best burgers of my life due to my fellow Yelpers' reviews but was sort of disappointed.  I did like the fries in the shopping cart, that was pretty creative, but they weren't anything special.  Same way I felt about the Delux burger.  The meat was dry and the condiments were lacking which made it worse.  I thiknk the bun was the best part.  I did do a cool beer flight which was nice.  The atmosphere is pretty neat here but I probably won't visit again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time eating at Delux. We were seated right away and were given roses for Valentine's Day. I thought that was sweet. I was pumped to be there. Everyone I know raves about their burgers and I thought I was in for a real treat. I scanned the menu and decided to go with the Delux burger and a basket of fries to share with my sister. The beer selection here is 5 stars. Unfortunately they were out of sunshine wheat beer so I settled for a beer suggested by our waiter. I think it was Papago? The beer was so good it made me forget about sunshine wheat! Our fries were delivered before our burger. I tried to practice self control and wait till my burger arrived but I caved in. The fries were great! I love the aoli sauce that comes with it. Then my burger arrived. I took my first bite and was NOT impressed. In fact I was disgusted because it smelled weird. I don't know if it's the organic meat that they use or what but I took one bite and had the waiter box it up so I could give it to my dad. He'll eat anything. I enjoyed the rest of my beer and fries and still left a happy camper. I'd come back for drinks but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Supposedly Delux is the only place that sells lobster bisque in all of the Valley.  After a week of craving lobster bisque, a friend of mine told me that Delux sells this soup.  I've been meaning to go to Delux for awhile.  I hear their burgers are the best in the Valley. I got crap on twitter because my friends knew I was going to Delux, but getting the soup instead of a burger.  C'est la vie...last week, my cravings were to strong and I had to give in.  Burgers will have to wait.  I went to Delux 2 Go specifically for the soup.  I decided to surprise my boyfriend with lunch and ordered him one too.  Delux sells soups daily.  They make lobster bisque on Wednesdays. A schedule of their soups is on their menu which can be found on their website.  I also ordered the tomato mozzarella salad.  I can never pass up a caprese salad.  While I waited for my order they offered me a water or iced tea.  I thought that was really nice.  The soups hit the spot.  The salad not so much.  The tomatoes and cheese were fresh.  I had problems with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Both came in their own containers.  I tried mixing them without success.  I tried dipping it.  Not luck there either.  It was very diappointing.  All in all, I will be back.  Just to try the burger and for a bowl of lobster bisque.  I loved the soup"}
{"text":"I love this place... granted I've only ever tried their Delux burger and sweet potato fries, both of which are amazing. Normally I'm a fairly picky eater so I was a little overwhelmed by the description of the Delux burger, but after a friend convinced me to just go for it without any substitutions, I tried it... and fell in love. Soooo good. The restaurant is pretty small and has a unique vibe to it. They serve a huge selection of beers. No complaints with the service.  I wouldn't suggest taking a larger party here, as it is so small and takes a long time to sit.  Depending on when you go, you can face a pretty long wait."}
{"text":"Delux is my favorite burger spot in the Camelback Corridor. I have been coming here for years and it never fails me. Juicy burgers, a nice selection of beer, and the cutest basket of fries.  No seriously, the fries come in a shopping cart. It ACTUALLY rolls.  Delux is also open late -- really it's one of the only spots to get good food later than 9 p.m. They also have reverse happy hour so their cocktails become easier on the wallet."}
{"text":"If you like your burger in a loud trendy joint, then you will love the atmosphere. The burger itself is awesome. Get the delux burger, the one with maytag and gruyere cheese served on a demi baguette. You wont be hungry after that. If you are pile on some sweet potato fries and a couple of craft brews and you are done!"}
{"text":"What's the sign of a fabulous restaurant? I simply cannot get this deelish memory out of my head -- and it's been weeks since I've eaten there. My restaurant habits tend to be that of repetition and fear of trying somewhere new. Having been a vegetarian for over a decade, new menus were more an exercise in fear than a potential find.  So a few weeks ago when I was feeling adventurous, I loaded the kid and the boy in the car and asked who wanted where and what to eat. The regular short list of restaurants offered nothing in the way of interest for any of us, and, desperate, I pulled out the Sidekick 3 to get some ideas. Ryan said he wanted a burger, so I searched for \"best burger near [my zip code]\" and a reference to Delux Burger popped up. It was relatively close to home, so off we went.  Arriving, the outside of the restaurant is a little deceptive. It's in a Safeway shopping center and if you're not looking for Delux, you're likely to miss it altogether. It's a tiny little place with a tiny little patio but (by virtue of being nestled in a shopping center) there's plenty of parking. Moms & Dads: I was a little nervous that an exclusive little diner like this would be the type to be unfriendly to kids, but that's definitely not an issue. Space is scant, but we sat on the patio and it was comfortable.  The menus were skinny and long and consisted mostly of the beer, wine, and liquor selection, which might have been their original focus from the start (but I don't know that for sure). Their hours are 11am-2am, so I think they're really hoping to serve a post-club-but-not-done-partying segment in the wee-er hours. I perused to find something other than beef or chicken (I don't eat either) and was thrilled to find a grown-up grilled cheese (3 cheese, oven-roasted tomatoes, baby arugula on a demi-baguette).  Shortly thereafter, I saw it. The delux Fresh Fish sandwich. The idea of a grilled cheese was interesting given the ingredients, but I wanted something less rich and more flavorful, and here it was, offered up to me in a single menu entry like a hand-picked wildflower from a wide-grinned, grateful, not-expecting-anything-in-return toddler...  From the menu:      Grilled Mahi Mahi marinated in sake and orange juice with wild herbs, served on a toasted, handcrafted brioche bun with redleaf lettuce, all-natural beefsteak tomatoes and red onions accompanied by sides of creme tartar and cucumber-pear medley.  One word describes this sandwich: Divine. It was hot and perfectly cooked. The fish was light and the flavors were magical. The bread wasn't overpowering and the lettuce was proportioned -just enough- to give you a taste and a different texture, but not take the spotlight from what the real star was. I couldn't get enough of this sandwich. Sadly, though, it came to an end much quicker than I'd desired and yet I was still craving more. How often does something so good and good for you leave you so breathless and wanting more?  We had also ordered a \"shopping cart\" of sweet potato and regular french fries (the kid loved that, though toddlers + things on wheels atop on high surfaces are surely a recipe for eventual disaster), and I snacked on those to curb any further temptation to order another sandwich. At $10 a pop, I didn't need to scarf these things like snacks.  The kid had a kids-friendly grilled cheese which was a panini-based creation (very simple) on a bed of french fries, though she didn't want anything to do with those fries when the shopping cart fries were also available and, by virtue of their container, much more tasty! Ryan had a burger and he liked it, too, but I honestly remember very little of our outing as I was too busy flying high on my mahi mahi experience.  Time kinda stood still for a little while and for that I must recommend Delux Burger to anyone who likes to eat stuff that tastes really good."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for burgers and fries! The milkshakes are the best milkshakes across the valley (chocolate milkshake with peanut butter is the winner). Tons of beers with a rotating selection. The sushi is also really good-the citrus yellowtail is outstanding! There are also several dessert options to top it all off."}
{"text":"Great burgers!  If you're going to pay $9 for a hamburger, this is the place to do it.  Don't forget to get the sweet potato fries.......& if you wanna go for a real calorie fest............ the milkshakes are good too.   Unfortunately, I will say I was rather disappointed with the Red Velvet Cupcake.  It was just the opposite of what it should be.  It's dry & there is waaaaaay too much frosting. Service is good, but expect to wait a little bit for a table, no matter what time you go."}
{"text":"Best burger & sushi in AZ! They use all natural Niman ranch beef that is truly delicious. Sushi is fresh and delicious.,The sweet potato fries are Ah-mazing & arrive in a cute little shopping cart. The atmosphere is clean, fun & vibrant. Have become a regular because the food & the service is on point. Ask for Tara as she is a fantastic person who also happens to be an excellent server. Even gives us a to go of carrot & beet spiral swirls for our guinea pig. The owner, Lenny, is here in the evenings often and makes a point of making sure your meal & experience is great. Personalized attention & delicious food=must go!  Found another fun & wonderful server in Vanessa. Food amazing as always. Best burger in town!"}
{"text":"Delux is awesome! Great burgers restaurant atmosphere but bar status at the same time! With the newish sushi bar inclusion it rounds off as an overall great place for a date."}
{"text":"Order the fries - they come in a tiny shopping cart. Like a fully legit shopping cart with wheels and everything . They tasted pretty good, too.   The Delux burger was flavorful and arrived quickly. They also sell sushi in the evening which was surprisingly delicious. You don't expect great sushi at a burger joint.   Service was good. There is a community table in the middle with cool lights (they were blue tonight - to celebrate Hanukkah?)"}
{"text":"Okay, i'm not sure about anything else on the menu yet, but the Chinese Chicken Salad is something else!!!!!!!  It's a little expensive for a salad, but its HUGE and well worth it.  Make sure you ask for an extra salad dressing.  There's so much salad that you may need it!"}
{"text":"Great hours!  So few places in Phoenix are open late but these guys are!  Great, friendly service and the burgers and fries are good. The sushi may be the best around and they have an incredible selection of beer. Definitely one of the better spots around!!"}
{"text":"I have a burger maybe every 4 months, so when I eat one I want it to be perfect. Delux definitely delivers to my needs. The Delux Burger is by far one of the most delicious burgers I have ever had. Within the 4 month stretch, I usually eat the vegetable panini which is also never a let down. My most perfect meal would be the vegetable panini with an order of sweet potato fries (I have finally learned not to get the mixed basket since the normal fries always disappoint). It is enough to split with someone. Dipping the panini in the special sauce makes it all the better. The food is always good in my experience, but when I go I usually choose to eat outside since inside is so dark and you can't really get up to go to the bathroom without knocking something off someone's table or putting your a** in their face. But if you're in to that closeness, darkness, hip, loud, can't see your food thing then you'll be fine. Delux is a great place to go on a Sunday night at midnight since it really is the only place open in the area. Thank God for that."}
{"text":"The owner reached out and sent me a gift card to make up for my previous experience so I tried this place again.   I have to say that I went in a little nervous. We ordered two tuna rolls, a Delux burger, and fresh wasabi.  I almost ordered my burger medium temperature because of the issue we had last time. However, I gave this place the benefit of the doubt and ordered the meat done medium rare. Our first visit here must've been a fluke because it was cooked perfectly this time. The flavors were spot on and the quality was great. Do yourself a favor and try one of their burgers!!!  Our tuna rolls were definitely better quality than before. The rice wasn't mealy as it previously was. We started with one and then ordered two because the first was delicious! The reverse happy hour also made the rolls very affordable.   Finally, we ordered fresh wasabi for $3. Our server was nice enough to bring us a small sample which had us hooked since my boyfriend is a wasabi fiend and uses a TON on sushi. It's a little pricey but definitely worth it if you can splurge.   Overall, I'm glad I gave this place a second change and that the owner reached out to make things right. It's a little pricey to be on my regular rotation but a great spot for date night especially if your S/O, like mine, isn't a huge sushi fan but loves a good burger. Heck, I'm craving one of their burgers as I write this!"}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Delux in a long while.  The recent Phoenix burger insurgency has put too many alternative options on my plate.  I stopped in recently for lunch and was quickly reminded of its position on top of hamburger hill.   This place has staying power.  We will be continuing to eat there years after most of the other burger imitators have gone under."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the beer flights (The Chimay was good but I still prefer the White Label to the Gold) This popular idea has been spreading from beer bars, wine bars and restaurants. It is a great way to enjoy multiple drinks without overdoing it. Which most people do easily because they cannot hold their liquor... ha!  Ordering the mixed fries shopping cart basket is a unique culinary experience. I daresay that it is borderline semi genius. The use of regular and sweet potato fries is a fantastic flavor blend. I had ordered just a simple bacon beef burger so I could deduce the quality of their meat. The bacon was cooked very well and the beef tender (all natural from Niman ranch). I am surprised they are not packed consistently.  This place is chill for either an afternoon, evening or late night dining experience. Whether you go there to meet an old friend, a group of colleagues, or a date this place is fun for all! What is even better now than before is that the other side of 'the wall' is Delux's sushi bar. It is a great addition to an already gem of the desert. I recommend this venue to anyone and everyone that lives in the Phx Metro area and surrounding cities."}
{"text":"Best burgers ever. Holy cow this place is good! Open till 2am too. Wow I love it, been here multiple times and have taken multiple friends and they all say the same thing. The mixed fries are the best too"}
{"text":"DELUUUUXXX! Is my absolute favorite burger!!! Anytime I want a burger i dont even hesitate its gonna be Delux!   The first time I went to Delux it was with my mom  and her girlfriends we had a huge group of 12 women. Our waiter was such a delight he knew all of the beers on tap and knew his wine very well. I got the pear cider (delicious!) When it came down to ordering he told us if we haven't eaten there before then we have to get the burger me./well so we all did just that. And of course we got the fries (you can get the fries mixed with sweet potatoe and russet) i highly recommend getting the mixed fries. And OMG you have to ask for extra sauce that comes with the fries because its not only good with the fries its superior on you burger.  That burger is gourmet and freaking amazing it seriously melts in  you mouth! There is a reason why they only put lettuce on this master piece. You can taste the perfect of the meat the and the gooey deliciousness of guryer and blue cheese. For the price of everything its not even expensive!  My mother and i loved this place so much we went back the next day!"}
{"text":"Great food with a relaxing, yet upbeat atmosphere. The food is very clean tasting and filling. I recommend this place to people all over the valley."}
{"text":"3 words......Sweet Potato Fries! Sure they have burgers to die for, but when you get a shopping cart of those fries..... man you can die a happy man.  Great service,  friendly people,  awesome beer on tap."}
{"text":"I'm not joking when I say this place is 5 star. From the the service, to the food, even the drinks, everything is always great. My fiance always gets the sushi and I can get a burger or a sandwich and they exceed in both areas so we both get something we want. Plus their chipotle aioli is fantastic - a must get with anything. Pro tip: You can buy chipotle aioli to take home!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh food! High quality burgers, good presentation as well. The Toasted baguette with olive oil and balsamic was a delicious starter. Fair prices & service at the bar was good.. We will be back"}
{"text":"I want to dislike this place.  Why?  Because it's aims to add pretension to the humble hamburger joint - does any town need another restaurant selling a 15$ burger & fries?    But damnit if they don't have a tasty burger and fries.  Well constructed with great flavor and texture combinations.  Their delux burger is unequivocally delicious and, at least the one I was served tonight, perfectly cooked to my specified temperature.  I comment about this because far too few places get the basics correct.  Delux did tonight."}
{"text":"Ossington isn't exactly the culinary destination in Toronto, but that doesn't mean it can't have its fair share of great eateries.   Delux is just that, a sort of fish out of water in an area known more for discarded box springs and hobos than fine cuisine. But the ambiance in this little French bistro is strong enough to make you forget where you are and just enjoy your surroundings.   I shared a molasses pulled pork sandwich and fries with a friend, and of a bottle of wine of course, and the food was just delicious. The pork was tender and juicy and smothered between two slices of homemade bread. The fries were also perfect - crispy and light and not greasy in the slightest. The waiter we had was friendly and amicable and we chatted about the resaturant's hours and how business was going.  The wine was also very tasty - a dry fresh white with may not have been the best pairing with pork but it was tasty none the less. The food wasn't too expensive either, considering the tastiness of the meal!  If you're looking for a new hot spot to hit up, away from where all the normal foodies like to hang, Delux is it!"}
{"text":"I love getting the sliders! The food is delicious!  It can be a little cramped when they are busy, but over all it is a great experience!"}
{"text":"A little known fact about me may just be that I have an obsession with tomatoes. They are always on the grocery list, they are the one thing I'd choose over all others if I had to pick one food item to live on for the rest of my life, they fit into my daily diet - breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack - they're my food soul mate.   And right now, Delux wins the top prize for favourite tomato sandwich: a beautifully stacked tomato, avocado and queso medley inside a soft bun melted in my mouth. I was bummed that they were out of plantains and wished that I had known to order a side to accompany my sandwich, but that's what second and third visits are for. Perhaps at another visit I'll learn why it's categorized as \"French\" and not \"Cuban\" on Yelp, but I'll leave that to the local Torontonian Yelp community to decide.   On a weekday at lunchtime, it's pretty quiet, which worked well for Vivek S and myself who sprawled out in one of the comfy booths, enjoying coffees and the big bottle of water that was left on our table.  Oh, and the sugared donuts served in a bag, alongside of a dulce de leche dip and a Cuban coffee? Yeah, that's the way every meal should finish!"}
{"text":"I'm sure I don't have to mention that they have the best sweet potato fries around, but just in case you didn't know, I'm telling you now, THEY HAVE THE BEST SWEET POTATO FRIES AROUND!!!  My first visit to Delux, back when I was a carnivore, was suggested by a friend after a night at the club ended way too early (no comment), and Denny's was not an option. I ordered a burger and a side of sweet potato fries because I'd never tried them before, and now I make sure those are the only fries I ever eat.  This last week I took my boyfriend there because he'd never wandered past his Gilbert bubble and since there really wasn't anything we could eat that had no meat (I know, vegetarian in a burger place, but I only wanted the fries) we ordered a cheese panini and a large order of mixed fries. My bf couldn't gobble them up fast enough. I knew I should have ordered two =("}
{"text":"Amare Stoudemire used to eat here when he was playing for the Suns; you may disagree with his move to the Knicks, but you should trust his judgement in burgers.   The Delux signature burger is pretty awesome, but I'm going to be real: I like the grilled cheese or the hot dog much better than the burgers. Even better than either of these are the sweet potato fries with aeoli sauce!  The service is fantastic! The waiters are some of the nicest I've ever met. Try to get Brad if you can!  Delux is open late, so it is the best place to go for food after a long night at the bars or clubs!"}
{"text":"Super warm spot. Amazing burgers and food, one of my favorite places to go. My best friend loves going to a burger place & having sushi options. 5\5!"}
{"text":"All in all I liked it a lot an would go back ... I really wanted to try there lobster soup and mushroom soup but I went on the wrong day so I will be back for that   But I had the turkey sandwich . It was really good but it could use a little more flavor .. My date got  the grilled cheese with sun dried tomatoes and that was very good as well but it could of been more melted but hands down best thing was the frys"}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times now. The most recent visit being yesterday for my birthday dinner. Delux did not disappoint me. I was hesitant to order sushi from here but decided to go ahead and try it. I am so glad that I did. I got the Tiger Roll. On the bottom of the sushi menu it asks for no modifications or substitutions but our wonderful server Lauren said that it would be no problem so I got it without cucumber and added cream cheese. I cannot wait to come back and try another roll. My husband got the duo sliders and asked for them well done and they came out medium rare. He ate one but couldn't manage eating the second. Ended up being okay though since we had ordered an appetizer and he shared some of my sushi. All in all will definitely be back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Miss Zen 32 so glad to be able to have their sushi still! Beet salad is also yum in addition to some of their cocktails. I no longer drink beer, but they have a great list!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I am a frequent customer, I have a 10% off discount card. I would eat here everyday if I could afford it. I can walk here from home. NO DUI. Tara and the staff here rock. As good as it gets."}
{"text":"Another must stop for us while we're in AZ. We've had a lot here too - beers and food! Last time I got the beat salad - filled me up w/o ruining my appetite for beers :) And \"shopping cart fries\" get the blend and don't forget that yellow/orange sauce!! Can't wait to try their sushi element next!"}
{"text":"good burger, though I wish that demi baguette was a little more toasted, or less bready more brioche like texture. I'm not a huge fan of the bread but it's not bad.  I normally don't like sweet potato fries, but they are really good.  Cause they are savory and not way sweet like the way most people serve them.  The meat is also cooked properly, I hate when I order a Medium burger and a friend orders a medium well and it's the same thing."}
{"text":"I'm a regular. If you want a great burger, fries and a beer -- from an enormous selection on tap -- Delux is an excellent choice. If you want that with a side of sushi its probably the only place in Phoenix. The sushi is excellent and fresh. Having it with french fries, a burger and a beer is odd, but very enjoyable. The burgers are consistently excellent. They encourage you to order medium rare with is unusual for a burger joint and shows that they have confidence in their beef. The Chinese chicken salad is one of my favorite items on the menu. Also, if you want this at 1 am it's the only place around. The bar staff are always up for conversation. In the parking lot you'll see Porsches and pickup trucks. At the bar 20 year olds are seated next to 65+ year olds and after a few beers everyone is chatting. It's also a great place for take out."}
{"text":"It was my first time here on a Saturday. I was beyond impressed. Everything was modern and the staff were polite. The whole place was elegant yet had an illusion; it looked like there's a huge mirror on the wall.. really it's the other side of the room. The food was great along with the ambience."}
{"text":"Really great place for lunch! I had the avocado and tomato sandwich was it was soooo delicious! The bread was fantastic. We also got the sweet plantains which were perfect and the fritters. The only down side was the waiter was slow with checking in on us so we eventually just went up to the cash to pay."}
{"text":"5/5 for me!  What a great burger place.  My husband found this place online and because of the great reviews, we decided to try it out during a trip out to Phoenix.  We were definitely not disappointed.  The portions were generous and well worth it.  It definitely is a little pricey for burgers and fries (we probably paid about $35 for 2 people)  But if you want quality, go to Delux!  Our waiter was one of the best servers we have had in awhile.  He was on top of things and very friendly.  We never had to ask for drink refills or condiments, he was always 2 steps ahead of us.  The ambiance was very inviting as well.  And the best part?  ITS OPEN LATE!"}
{"text":"Delux perhaps defined the entire summer I spent in Phoenix. I have only fond memories of this place.  Hip: let's get this out of the way first. Yes, from the blue and black lights in funky round balls atop the bar to the center table with stools to the booths along the side, the interior oozes of cool. I am particularly picky about where I sit in restaurants, but I tried pretty much every seat in the house here and I will say they're all great for whatever matches your mood. The place is small inside, and there's sometimes waits during peak hours/weekends.   The hours. This is what really made Delux...well, deluxe for me. It's open so late, and I loved coming here for a more mellow nightcap on weekends. The drink list is superb (essentially, the food consists of one page and the drinks are the other 7 pages of the menu) and I always found the bartender to prepare our drinks well and quickly.  Now, the food. Burgers. Are. Delicious. They are basically your high class, uber-chic and swanky burgers with impeccable presentation. I was impressed. I must say I'm sold on not only the image but also the taste. The perfect ratio of protein-carb-toppings. I would highly suggest pretty much any of their burgers, but start with their Delux Burger. It's the staple. As for the sides, yes, the fries (sweet potato AND regular) are tasty and adorable, coming in this little shopping cart, which makes it perfect to share. They are, likewise, delicious. Also, they don't make you feel like you need to go run a marathon or your heart might give out on you, so that was always a huge incentive for me to indulge.  Service has always been good here on the whole. Sometimes, naturally, during the busy times it can get a little slow and you can feel slightly neglected, but hopefully your company and/or the food will ease the pain.  I miss Delux. A LOT. I am also dying to try their cupcakes, which weren't part of the menu when I was last there..."}
{"text":"Went late last night with the family after a long day. Wanted to try The Grind, but they close at 9:30. Next up; Delux.  Went in, got seated promptly. Service was excellent. Ordered a Delux burger, and 2 Chinese Chicken Salads. $9.5, and $9 respectively. 1 beer, 2 glasses of wine, and two Ketels and Soda. The basket of mixed fries; get ready for it.... $6. Are you effing serious? Grand total, $77. Tip and total $83. (edit: my numbers were off, and it was brought to my attn that the tip sucked... so it was closer to $87 or 88.. we did leave a fair tip because the service was good.)  Value. It sucked. 6 bucks for a basket of mixed fries; it had better come with a blow-job. The bread on the burger was a little firm. Not saying stale, but a little firm. The burger was cooked right, but it just missed something. The salads were good, but not great. Just a ho-hum meal.   Great selection of beers on tap, and a great bar. Great service, too, but the food left too much on the plate to be taken seriously as a $100 burger joint.   For almost $100 you should leave with a big smile on your face, not holding your ass like someone just raped you.    Gotta say... It was entertaining watching a girl make out with two different guys at the same time. (+1 star) The whole group was snowed out of their minds. (-1 star) Think she put that in the, \"things I did last night that I do not remember\" category? Eh, maybe. But, it was a little awkward sitting with my family while watching the sexcapade.   So, the lesson here boys and girls is, when it's the only late-night game in town, you can charge whatever you want."}
{"text":"Love coming to Delux for lunch during the week. Our office recently moved really close and have already been back several times. First time had the turkey burger and the basket of fries with the mix of fries and they were delicious! the other times we have been back we get the Chicken Salad and it is one of my favorite salads in town! The serving size is huge and worth every penny. Shoot...I'm already craving it again!   We are always promptly seated and our orders are always taken quickly but without feeling rushed. Service is great and will not disappoint you at all."}
{"text":"As we were passing through Phoenix we decided to stop in and eat! What a great choice! Fantastic service and great food! Two of us had the burgers (big, juicy, amazing) and two of us had the albacore tuna sandwich and the chicken salad sandwich! The fries were so good! Prices were very reasonable considering the presentation and quality of the good!   An added bonus, I left my 6 year olds iPad at the restaurant and they are happily mailing the iPad back to me in California! Talk about going the extra mile!!! Thanks to the amazing staff for the food and the extra customer service!"}
{"text":"Delux is a modern take on the old-fashioned concept of a diner.  It's not a big restaurant.  If you are against eating at the bar or a more communal type-table, get there early and be prepared to wait.  If you're waiting at the bar, Delux has a decent list of beers, including a few different choices for flights of beers.  Once you're seated, get the Delux Burger!  By the way, Delux is one of the few places I've ever been where they allow you to order a burger medium rare.  Regardless of how you order it, though, I can't think of anything about this burger that i don't like.  Also, it's a big enough burger that you can probably share it with someone else, or take half of it home.  Be sure to order some sweet potato fries, a la cart."}
{"text":"I experienced severe waiter envy, once again, at Delux.  I actually had not gone to Delux since I bit into a chicken last time I wrote this review. But it was late at night, I was craving Chimay on tap and sweet potato fries and I knew they had Youngs Double Chocolate Stout on tap too. Plus it wasn't too bad of a drive from Tempe.  We heard Blonde Redhead coming in, a nice sonic surprise, but from there service plummeted. The host didn't even get up and as we went to the bar to look at the beers, he deadpanned \"You guys are just sitting at the bar right\" and didn't even look up from the stand. Okkkaaayyyyy.  Sat down at a table and our waiter ...no, our dude who brought us food once in a while, lets call him Noah, said \"what do you guys want to drink\". Ok. So we gave him the orders, brought back delicious Chimay, then came back 1/2 way through the drink (btw, you dont drink Chimay fast) and said \"ready yet?\". We first got the basket of mixed, which we demolished and def. better than last time we were here. Tim ordered the traditional delux burger on whole wheat bun and asked if it could be cut in half (his mustache has odd handling needs) and Noah deadpanned \"it already is like that\". If he could have said DUH at the end, I wouldn't have been surprised.  As his burger was done halfway, he brought him the Youngs Double Chocolate Stout cause I was still working on my Chimay. Fair game. However, Tim was done with the burger and we sat there. And watched the other waiter be so much better than Noah. The other waiter smiled, asked how people liked fries, the OTHER waiter even took our empty plates and glasses for us it was sitting there for so long! I wanted other waiter. I waited for Noah. Finally, I GOT up and ordered my own beer (Dogfish Punkin Ale) from the bartender and ran my card with her instead of Noah getting that tip from me.   While I was at the bar, he came back to our table and asked if we wanted dessert or if I wanted another beer! A little late, Noah, don't you think? Tim still ordered a chocolate chip cookie, and Noah dropped it off with the plate and two forks. Ooo, was it warmed up and goo....no. We went to get our forks-bascially cold and crispy. Okay. So we did manage to fork it in half and eat it with our hands. At this point Noah swoops to Tim and says in a loud, weirdly hopeful voice \"Another beer?\" \"Uh, no just the check, thank you\".   The most Noah does is at the end is when he drops off the bill \"HAVE A GOOD NIGHT\". Every single quote from him is verbatim. No hello, hows it going, have you been here before, HOW IS ANYTHING, nothing. It really wasn't that busy and it took what could have been a laid back night of burgers and fries and delicious beer into a frustrated and annoyed night.  If I come here, in another year or two, I will sit at the bar like I should have done originally  and until I cannot resist the Chimay. But two horrible services like that in a row? That is bullshit.  I'll borrow a shopping cart from my own friendly neighborhood bum and fill it with my own goddamn Safeway frozen sweet potato fries while drinking Natty Ice, thank you."}
{"text":"I remember my first visit to Delux,it was before heading over to shop in the craziness that is Last Chance. Anyway my friend suggested this spot because of their sweet potato fries...that's all she had to say, I was down!! It's a trendy little spot inside of a strip mall, it kinda looked outta place but it stood out in a good way.  I ordered the sweet potato fries they were yummy (I like mine a little crispier, but they were still delish)  and the CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD...Mmmmmm the flavors were amazing, the red peppers, cilantro, romaine and that peanuty vinaigrette is too die for! I was a little worried that I wasn't going to get full but this salad was easily large enough for 2.I'm ashamed to say that the 3 times that I have been to Delux I have had this salad, I'm hooked. Next time I promise I will venture out and try one of these burgers everyone keeps raving about...maybe."}
{"text":"A new one on Ossington wihch is just across from Foxley. Billed as French-Cuban but mostly a French menu. A bare interior but with a warm atmosphere. Limited seating and ask for a booth when making a reservation for 4. The menu is limited but has several few gems.   The charcuterie was smaller portions but marked by a tasty duck breast/ foie gras terrine. A celery root soup was flavorful. The much raved Cubano lived up to billing. Just the right mix of meaty crunchiness.  A braised short rib was very soft and hearty. Steak frites consisted of a flat-iron steak, smoky and tender. The fries in this place are a perfect balance of starch and crunch.  The one thing you MUST have and definitely earns a star on its own is the warm homemade chocolate chip cookies. Beautifully moist and crumble soft. Order with a steamed milk. YUM.   Overall, definitely worth another visit."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet! I live around the corner! I eat here all the time! Delux I'm so sorry I neglected to give you props until now! If you love burgers, sushi and craft beer look no further. They're all perfect. What we love the most is being able to go for sushi and get fries on the side. Or go for a burger and also have a sushi roll. It's like a dream. A yummy burgery sushi beery fantasy. They do all of it exactly right. They have sushi happy hour. They stay open late which is a rarity in Phoenix. They have cocktails. There's plenty of parking. They do take out. They do lettuce wraps. The lighting is perfect. The service is fast and friendly. The prices are right. It's so good I'm getting a little choked up just thinking about the meal I had only yesterday. Tito, get me some tissue. Jermaine stop teasing."}
{"text":"I've been to Delux several times, and each time has always been really great. Seriously some of the best burgers and fries that I have ever put in my mouth. Not the cheapest burger joint you are going to find, but the quality of the food speaks for itself. Sushi is actually really good as well. I don't like blue cheese so I always substitute the blue cheese/gruyere mixture for cheddar. I wish that they didn't pre-mix the cheese though because I would like to try the Delux burger with gruyere on it. One of the best burgers in Phoenix by far."}
{"text":"Located in the Biltmore/Arcadia area this has to be one of the best late night options available. Serving a variety of sandwiches and burgers till 2 am. I decided on the Delux burger cooked medium well. Solid quality ingredients, substituted the Bleu Cheese for cheddar on my burger. Had an order of sweet potato fries to go alone with my meal. Everything is à la carte and the fries come separately. Expect to spend about $22 for a burger & fries. Overall a nice upscale burger bar with a stylish ambience!"}
{"text":"Great sweet potato chips!!! Great burgers, the Delux and the Turkey are favorites.  Solid sushi. Vanilla shakes are the BEST! Open until 2am.  What more can you ask for."}
{"text":"Can't speak for Delux as a bar or social setting, but lunch out on the patio was somewhat mediocre.  Liked the fries (served in a mini-shopping cart) and their accompanying orange concoction, but the burgers were bland.  The outdoor seating area, with its view of the mini-mall parking lot, was less than glamorous.    One redeeming characteristic, aside from the manageable price, was the gazpacho, which was relatively delicious.  Would order, again, but that's about it.  A bit overrated.  Wheelchair friendly on the aforementioned patio, but not so much around the high bar table troughs inside.  *Been here a couple more times and feel like the food is at least dependable, and the attitude is kept at a minimum.  Deserves and extra star or two more than my original review because it's the kind of place that you don't love, but that you can comfortably hang out at for awhile w/ your friends, yapping it up.  Also, open late and full of beers."}
{"text":"Who knew that sushi in the Phoenix area could be oh so delicious?!  Two thumbs up for the talented sushi chef behind the counter by the name of Balo.  His creations clearly showed his passion and it was an honor for both myself and my husband to have enjoyed such delicacy. With Balo, Delux is definitely the best sushi place in town!"}
{"text":"Dining Experience: Dinner  Specialty: Quebecois/Cuban Fusion Menu items: Pressed Cubano Sandwich, Black Cod & Steamed PEI Mussels and Steak Frites Wine Pairing: Pinot Noir, Beaune-Burgundy.  It's quite a delight to find restaurants that truly give you a run for your taste buds. It's even more interesting when those same restaurants explore with different types of cuisines, without being afraid to be boxed into a \"specialty\".  I say Delux is one of them. Some people think of it as French inspired; others say it has Cuban influence...I say, who cares? In my mind, when it comes to Cuban and French, it just doesn't get better than that (ok, maybe if you add some Italian to that mix).  I fell in like with Delux from the moment the fresh Pressed Cubano Sandwich landed on my table. To the naked eye, the sandwich looks like your typical grilled ham and cheese. However, this is way more than a sandwich, its a \"deluxury\". Cider cured pork shoulder (lamb shoulder could've also worked here), ham, gruyere cheese, grainy mustard, cornichons (aka pickled cucumbers) and red onions, are definitely not the typical ingredients one finds in a grilled sandwich.  The acidity of the cornichons mixed with the nuttiness of the gruyere and the strong flavour of the pork created that je ne sais quoi I was hoping for.  Moving from the Cuban inspired to the French influence, we are now on to the Black Cod and Steamed PEI Mussels on a Bouillabaisse broth.  Having previously found Julia's Boeuf Bourguignon at a Toronto spot, I was extremely happy to see yet another place showing off with a great execution of her recipes. Bouillabaisse is a seafood soup originating from the south of France made with various kinds of cooked fish, shellfish and vegetables. The soup is flavored with a variety of herbs and spices such as garlic, orange peel, basil, bay leafs, fennel and saffron. Delux managed to make the broth with two of my favourite aquatic animals - Black Cod and Mussels. The cod was soft and buttery and topped with a crunchy and perfectly fried skin; the mussels were fresh, chunky and tasty. All in all a great Julia experience.  Fully aware that Delux was known for its Steak Frites; the decision was made to go with this recommend. It didn't disappoint. Deluxe's Wellington County Flat Iron Steak has been named one of the top 5 Steak Frites to eat in Toronto by Toronto Life. Next to Jacob's and CO steak frites, their stake offers a unique earthy mouth-watering flavour. I am sure the fact that the meat is grass-fed has a lot do with its taste, as well the way in which they cook it. Paired with some well done French fries, this was certainly the way to end a meal at Delux. Ok, I take that back...dessert would have been awesome, but unfortunately this Foodie can't over do it. Like my fellow Colombian said, my hips don't lie.  Until next time Foodies.  Buen Provecho, Viviana."}
{"text":"Henry's is a wanna-be camera store. They are extremely rude and ill mannered. Two years ago a purchased a Sekonic light meter from them. One day, apprx  a month afte,r I was out shooting with a medium format, and I discovered the meter was about a third of a stop off. I had misplaced the receipt. I took it back to them. They could of checked their files on their computer system. However, because of a speech impediment, they must of thought I was stupid; so they saw fit to dismiss me. Then they demonstrated their primitive and ill bred manners and up bringing by talking down to me and being patronizing. Funny thing, I have been into photography for 30 yeara and even did work for a travel magazine in Florida  I left and went to Vistek where I have also been purchasing equipment. I explained the situation to them. To cut a long story short: Vistek sent it out and I got it back ten days later, fixed. Onlly charging me $11.00 dollars for shipping.  Vistek, Thank-you  If anyone has any common sense stay away from Henry's. They are insulting and ill refined.  I phoned the manager, and he only said sorry and was short. As far as I am concerned thay are............"}
{"text":"Love coming here. Sweet potato fries are phenomenal. They're house sushi is to die for.  But top reason u keep coming back is the awesome staff and managers running the place. I never feel unwelcome! They're always mindful of our experience too.. just replaced cold fries on the house.   Will always come here for a good time and great food"}
{"text":"So I was just passing through Phoenix and decided to check this place out.  What a good decision that turned out to be.  I ordered the Delux Burger medium rare which was cooked perfectly, moist and flavorful.  I also ordered the mixed basket of french fries and sweet potato fries which comes in a novel \"mini shopping cart\".  The only thing cooler would have been if we were able to take it home as a souvenir.  The fries were also cooked perfectly, not too oily but crispy with a nice subtle sweetness on the sweet potato fries.  The staff was also very friendly and expedient and they have a huge selection of beers on tap.  The only downside I can think of would be the price, which isn't exorbitant but also isn't the cheapest burger you're going to eat.  Still, the quality of the food and the excellent service have me giving Delux an emphatic 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I frequent Delux about 3-4 times a month and each time I have an enjoyable experience Depending on the time and occasion, your visit can be calm and personal or it can be loud and not so intimate The blue island seating is so close together and groups of 2 sit next to people shoulder to shoulder basically I don't mind this but I have noticed that some people may need more space   Today my server was very great She was pretty busy but she managed to handle her tables in a very timely manner She made sure we had water When taking our orders, she gave an appropriate amount of time for us to look over the menu I had the Delux Burger, all of their burgers are great I have yet to try their sushi but I will soon I love their fries My bf loves their sweet potato fries We usually have to get half and half Today I was parched from playing in an all day sand volleyball tourney which we won so I wanted to celebrate by having a drink Delux has a great drink menu  The cocktails are a bit pricey Very good beer menu I opted for a flight of 3 I chose the fruity one (Sweet Street) It consisted of Crispin, a raspberry ale called Lindeman Framboise, and Papago Orange Blossom I liked all but the POB, I really didn't care for it"}
{"text":"The sweet potato fries with the chipotle aoili are so delicious. This is one of my favorite places to go because the food is consistently good. They have great sushi and drinks for a quick happy hour or late night spot to meet up with friends. My room mates and I can always agree to eat here."}
{"text":"I've loooooved Delux for years! This place is always incredible! Went to have lunch with a girlfriend, we both got the Asian salad and some sweet potato fries (of course! It's a must when u come) the sauce served with is yummy in your tummy! We got the smaller version of the salad and the portion was perfect for me since I still had fries on the side. The service here is also spectacular! Our waitress was a sweetheart and another man consistently checked up on us as well. We were really looking to catch up, so it was really nice that even after our meal they still made sure we were okay. Everything on the menu is delicious here, I've been many times. I'd recommend Delux to anyone! You'll be far from disappointed in all aspects!:)"}
{"text":"Outstanding sweet potato fries. The burger is served on a baguette roll rather than your traditional hamburger bun. They say their beef is sourced directly from Niman Ranch, and although I can't say I understand the significance of that, the beef patty at Delux is one of the most flavorful, and juicy patty that I've had. There's lots of parking available and it is conveniently located in Biltmore near all the business centers."}
{"text":"This is really a high quality burger place.  If you want a greasy spoon burger joint (which sometimes I grave) this is not the place.    This is more burgers the way Elements Restaurant would serve them.  What's great about this place is that it also serves high quality healthy food (beet salads, insalata caprese, sushi, etc.)  So for you guys who have healthy eating wives, like mine, go her with equanimity. You stuff your expanding gut and she can remain gorgeous and slender.   Ok, the fries were wonderful and not greasy but a tad too healthy for my redneck taste.  The burgers are of the highest quality.  You can see it and smell it even before you take one bite.  I love the way they cut up just the right amount of lettuce for you.  The pickles are sliced perfectly.  The meat is cooked just the way you order it.  etc etc.  My only complain--which is purely individual--is that I would rather a soft bun than a brioche bun.  I'm getting tired of burgers and sandwiches served on brioche.  I know it's french and chic but it's also too thick and destroys that elusive balance between bread and meat that makes a burger a burger--take a lesson from In 'n Out.  Our waitress was delightful and this place from the manager to the illegal alien serving the water go out of their way to make you feel welcome and appreciated.  My only counsel would be to the manager to stop by a patron's table once.  After three times, it starts to become interruptive--especially when I'm in the midst of gnawing on your delicious burger.  Chapeau to all those who work hard to make this place great and it is great."}
{"text":"Although I am not sure it is worth the hour wait, I loved the concept.  The burger was delicious, but the sweet potato fries were my favorite part.  The fries come in cute little mini shopping carts and I recommend going half and half w/ regular fries for the variety.  Yes, it is very trendy but we had a great time!  We split a salad and a burger so it is not too pricey if you go that way.  Also, they have a great variety of cocktails which left me very happy by the time we left."}
{"text":"The best part about this restaurant is that they are open super late. I am a night owl so I love coming here for some late night sushi or the amazing Delux Burger. Also, make sure you get the sweet potato fries that they bring to you in a little shopping cart! The milk shake is amazing too made with real vanilla ice cream. They also have a chocolate lava dessert with fudge and vanilla ice cream which is really good. The sushi is pretty good too. They have REAL wasabi here which is not a creamy as regular wasabi but chopped up. It's really good. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Perhaps it was all the hype that let me down? I've heard a lot about Delux and I'm never in the area.  Recently, I had a meeting there and got my first shot at it.   Sweet Potato Fries were the best I've had. Very good taste, little crispy on the outside and good texture and temperature inside.  I'd say they were too heavily salted but I'm hardly one to complain about that.  Burger was very juicy and fresh and cooked just right, which led to the bottom of the bun becoming soggy but I can deal with that - I eat slow.  Server was on top of it and, from what it seemed, the manager came around a couple times and made sure everything was going well and that we were happy.  Why 3 stars... It was just what 3-stars says... \"A-ok\"... no problems, everything was good but I wouldn't say that \"yay! I'm a fan\".   It's an upscale trendy burger joint.  To be honest I've had better burgers in hole-in-the wall mom-and-pop shops.  I know the meat is special and grass fed with no hormones or whatever but it's not worth paying x2 as much for. That's about all I have to say about that.  I'd be back but not if I'm buyin :) lol"}
{"text":"Another place I had heard great things about. I joined my Mom and Aunt for a bite between work (I'm downtown) and catching Mary Poppins (Gammage in Tempe). The place had a great atmosphere adn was full of young folks (and the young at heart).  Our waiter (Michael?), was fantastic! Very helpful with the menu and seemed very comfortable, therefore we were comfortable. Didn't waste our time but seemed to know exactly what we wanted to try.  We hit up the happy hour which was great! Martinis and wine were our choice (both well done) and we started with the mixed basket of sweet potatoe and regular fries; which were AWESOME! I LOVED THE FRIES!  My Mom and I shared the Delux burger which was just enough filling to feel comfortable and not fall asleep during the peformance to follow. My Aunt had their other well known burger, but it didn't seem like anything special. The Delux was great but I'm not sure what was so delux (or $10 worth) about it. The fries are DELUX! I wish I would've had some cookies, I've heard their great. I guess next time. Think this might be a happy hour option in the future."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic ! Great late night trendy vibe , the food was perfectly portioned and delicious , I even ate the slightly high price without skipping a beat.  The decor and lighting combine classic comfort with  upbeat /updated lighting and accents.  The service was great as well and the waiter didn't steer me wrong with the veggie panini yum  my only personal disappointment was the margarita... no bueno I wanna say that it was reminiscent of ill prepared lemonade gone slightly off . I obviously drank it but only because it's irresponsible to throw it away"}
{"text":"OMG! How did I not know about this spot sooner? First of all, the drinks were delicious with an average price point of $8-12 depending on the time of day and drink. I actually like that my burger didn't come with fries because then I'll actually eat the burger. I'm one of those weirdos that if a side of fries comes with my meal, I MUST eat all the fries first because who likes to eat day old fries? NOBODY that's who!! Now, you can order a side of fries that arrive in the cutest mini grocery cart you've ever seen. So, duh! You've got to order that.  For starters we ordered the hot dog and split it three ways. Best life choice ever. For real. I haven't had a hot dog in years and this was just absolute perfection. Oh, and that pretzel bun. To die for. Seriously.  I ordered the turkey burger, which was absolutely delicious. The burger clearly was made to order in house. The meat was juicy and fresh and oh so flavorful. Side note: the sauce that comes on the side IS cilantro. So, if you're part of the genetic pool that finds cilantro to taste like soap like I do, DO NOT place it all over your top bun.  The fries, both regular and sweet potato were like crack. I couldn't stop. Okay, I've never actually tried crack and I never will, but I imagine that it's a very similar experience. Why do crack when you can eat carts full of fries instead?!?!  I did take half of my burger home simply because it's what I do. The next day it was just as juicy and delicious as it was the night before. An epic feat by anyone's standards.  Other reviews say they've gotten greedy with prices, and while I don't have previous experience to compare to, I didn't find the pricing to be outrageous.  It's true, this spot also does sushi. I'm not a fish eater, thanks again to genetics. But if that's you're thing, my companion who did order the sushi said it was on point. And he doesn't give praise lightly.  The vibe is dark and chic, without feeling overly pretentious. You can watch the game, or anime. The entire staff was friendly and inviting. And I'm pretty sure one of the owners came to check on our table. Which, I've not seen in a very long time and is a particularly touch."}
{"text":"The original hoity toity burger place.  Smallish portions but the burger is so good!  Quality protein done well.  Good french fries (you can do a mix with sweet potato if you like).  Shakes are thick and good.  I know that folks aren't happy with the smaller portions, but maybe it's a blessing in disguise with our ever expanding girths :)  Still a great place to come to and they are consistently open late!  A huge plus in Phoenix.  Still hugely busy and sometimes hard to get a table if you are with a huge group."}
{"text":"The burgers are fantastic! the sweet potato fries are my favorite! wonderful patio seating! however, my burger is never prepared the way I originally ask that's always a downer and disappointing however if you like your burger well done ask for VERY well done they like to cook them rare.    Open until 2am everyday of the week so that alone keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Legit.  Love the decor, great service, fresh ingredients and clever layout.  I had the signature burger and a flite of three beers.  We got a few sushi rolls, and it's easily the best sushi I've had in Arizona.  The fries came out in a freaking tiny shopping cart - AND they came with fry sauce!  For a fat kid who grew up in Idaho / Utah, this is an absolute staple when it comes to fry consumption.  The only reason this place doesn't get a 5th star is, the signature burger, while tasty, came out with a grease soaked bottom bun.  This leads to the sog-factor, which is a texture I find intolerable in the burger kingdom.  I'm sure it's not easy to make a burger patty WITH bacon mixed in non-soggy, but maybe a grilled bun, or some lettuce under the patty would help with this.  Either way, I will be back, and look forward to it!!"}
{"text":"The only thing I order here besides the tasty burger on rare occasion is the amazing oriental chicken salad. Yet I always regret if I don't ask for a side of extra dressing for the 2nd half next day. Huge salad will last 3 meals if you don't put dressing over the entire thing. I will drive for 30min just to pick up a take out salad. It's worth every bite!!!!"}
{"text":"Delux is anything but. They really should have called it, \"Sometimes Good, Sometimes Bad but Mostly Just OK\" There are definately some rules you have to follow here:  1) Always get an order of sweet potato fries. 2) Never do the mixed cart of fries as the cart always comes less than full 3) Never go during the day (you can see how dirty/not well maintained the place is)   4) Always order beer as their stock is great and it helps you forget about what you may have seen if you didn't follow rule 3 and looked at the floor or under your table."}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Ice Cube - Today Was a Good Day)  Just walking to Delux gotta thank god I didn't know they serve sushi that's kinda odd No parking from streets, no prob And they're cooking up some burgers with plenty of hogs (or bacon!) I got my grub on, but didn't pig out  Finally got a some yam fries that I wanna try out Hooked it up for later as I hit the shots Thinking will I live it up, for another happy hour Don't wanna go cause I had me some beer flights  And if I hit the streets, I can get a DUI Had to stop to get another bite Looking in my mirror and was redder than a beet But everythings alright  I got a mini burger, and it's for happy hour all night Called up the yelpers and I'm reviewing y'all Which soup, do you want to try out at all? Get me in Delux and that's no trouble Last week Yelped around and got a duo burger Ketchup and chipotle sauce all the way You gotta believe today was a Delux Day  A Delux day all day everyday!  Yes, Delux is staple burger joint of Phoenix for some times now and now serving Sushi!  Located next to the Biltmore area, Delux burger is known to have a great happy hour and late night eats.    The place is always popping when I attend.  The blue lighting totally weird me out, but it's alright.  I've never came here for breakfast or lunch; needless to say I'm sure it's pretty damn good cause I know the late night menu is awesome.  Craft beer and flights is a must and your fries come in a mini shopping cart!  Don't understand the concept behind it, but it's a whole lot of fries I tell you that much; generally served with a side of ketchup or chipotle.  The burgers here are no joke and one of the best in town.  Nice and moist and the condiment pairings are second to none!  Overall, Delux is a great place to hangout for drinks as well as enjoy a great meal.   Service here is always the best and always a welcoming smile. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to go to Delux, and had been meaning to try it for some time, but I finally got around to it this last weekend.  I'd heard how great their burgers were and that if you wanted to spend a little more than the average to get a fantastic burger, that was the place to go.    So, off we went to give it a shot.  We got there at around 6 or 6:30 on Saturday and the place was pretty busy, although there was no wait.  We were seated at the tables along the west wall.  Talk about an awkward entry onto the booth side.  The tables are so close together, there's no graceful in or out.   To the table next to me... I'm so sorry I invaded your space.  Some other reviewers have said it was loud, boy were they right.  It was quite noisy and crowded, even the servers had trouble getting around the people & I did hear 1 tray of dishes hit the ground.    On to the ordering... 1/2 the menu is drinks.  From beers to wines, they have you covered & I appreciated the options.  Food menu is small to average, but a decent selection of items. My boyfriend & I opted to both go for the Delux Burger.  Can't go wrong with the namesake, right?  High quality beef with arugula and a blend of cheeses, onions, and bacon.  mmmmm ... bacon.    As we waited anxiously for the tasty treats, I got nervous. I heard the woman next to me say, \"I seem to be missing my bacon\".  I saw her pull her burger apart, searching, and no bacon.  I was hoping it was a one time oversight and that my burger would come with bacon, as promised.  Not so.  Both my boyfriend and I were lacking our bacon.  Our server was just attentive enough to not be MIA, but if I'd waited for him to come back so that I could point out my lack of yummy pork product, I'd have been sitting another 15 minutes with food in front of me that, although lacking a bit, was fairly tasty.    This brings me to the fries.  Everyone keeps posting how fantastic the sweet potato fries were.  Um, yeah, average at best.  We got the 1/2 and 1/2 basket and both types were limp and bland.  They were only cooked to the point of being 'just done'.  No crispiness.  It made me sad.  Oh, and I have to throw this in, when asked if we wanted desert, we politely declined & said we were all set.  Apparently, that is server code for, \"No more fries for you!\".  Yup, he snatched up that basket of fries without asking if we were done.   All in all, I didn't hate it, but wow, I sure was hoping for something better.  You know, that gem of a place that you get a craving for.  Maybe it's like that blockbuster movie that you've heard so many good things about, you can't wait to see it, but it's been so built up that it winds up being a let down.  I'm not sure if it was an off night, but I'm also not sure I'll go back."}
{"text":"I got the lucky opportunity to tag along with the wife at her business lunch today.  Her boss, a lovely man named Jim, chose Delux, and what a pleasant surprise.  I ordered the cool Fresh Panini with fresh mozzerella cheese, fragrant basil and ripe tomatoes.  MMM, so good, dipped into a mix of balsamic and olive oil.  Morgan shared her burger with me, grassfed beef, and very juicy and delicious... I think it was topped with gorganzola?  So clean tasting... on very good brioche buns.  We also ordered a milk shake \"that's a pretty fuckin good milk shake!\"... chocolate goodness!  And dont forget the fries... we all shared baskets of regular idaho and sweet potato fries, served with ketchup and a mayo type sauce... WHAT THE HELL?  I dont like sweet potatoes or mayo, but why the hell couldn't I stop eating them!!!  Crazy good...  We HAVE TO GO BACK in the evening and try some beers, they have a ton on tap.  I don't like beer, but I do want to TRY if its from this place :o)  OH, one more thing, we sat at the bar and our server was awesome, Amanda was her name I believe.  Very nice and even recommended Zen down the way, which I already have to try."}
{"text":"I went in for their \"happy hour\". Well, it wasn't much of a happy hour. The price was only a $1.50 less than normal. Whoohoo. I got the sliders and sweet potato fries. Of course the burger doesn't come with fries like most restaurants nowadays, so that jacked the bill up more than I was hoping.  Okay, so the prices aren't great. It's actually kinda overpriced. One could go to the Vig and get the same quality food for significantly less. However, the service was great. My server continuously asked if I needed anything else and was friendly throughout my visit. The food itself was pretty good, and the fries inside a tiny shopping cart is a nice touch. The atmosphere is unique, dimly lit with blue lights; cool effect! Will I be returning? Probably not anytime soon, as I mentioned, I can eat the same quality food elsewhere at places with equally awesome environments for much less."}
{"text":"Delux is a somewhat-trendy hangout where you can easily make getting a burger and a beer part of your weekly routine. The atmosphere is sleek and chatty, with a distinct focus on their wide-range of beers on-tap that lines the bar area and a large communal table in the center of the restaurant. Delux rotates seasonal specialties into their beer selection so you're always either trying something new or enjoying an old favorite.  When it comes to the food at Delux the obvious choices are between one of two burgers, the Delux Burger or the Standard Classic. Both are BIG patties of meat that are recommended to be cooked to the rarer side. Which ever you decide on, it's sure to be filling and delicious, especially when paired with a basket of mixed (regular and sweet-potato) fries.  Much can be said about Delux's alternative sandwiches however. The vegetable panini and turkey burgers are flavorful, lighter alternative to the heavy burger. Delux's gazpacho soup is perfect for cooling down in the summer heat or anytime as a small snack.   Service is happy and usually snappy. Prices are reasonable though have risen steadily over the past few years (but where hasn't?). If it's past 10pm and dinner has still yet to be eaten, the choice to go to Delux is a no-brainer! Overall, a great place to frequent in the valley!"}
{"text":"This is the best late night burger and sushi place in town!   Well, it's close to the only such place, which is most certainly a positive.   In any case, Delux is a relic on Yelp. It remains largely unchanged, and reviewers throughout town have doted on their signature burger since Web 1.0. And while I harbor no resentment toward this establishment, I maintain reservations. The atmosphere is stellar, and so are the hours. But I am not quite sure this could stand up to the competition.   The Delux burger consists of a medium burger patty, gruyere cheese, alleged bacon, spinach, and a special sauce, all between a thick, sweet roll. For the usually strong ingredients it boasts, it came across as rather mild to me. I don't think the beef was seasoned at all, and I had to work hard to get past how mushy it was. Correct me if need be, but the point of undercooking beef is to let its quality shine, right? This meat was woefully average. Forgettable, even.   Fries are extra. TONS extra. At $7 for a mix of regular and sweet potato, this is the most expensive order of the side I've ever made. They aren't mind-blowing, but they are good, as is the aioli they're paired with. Ooh and aaah at the little shopping cart they're served in.   In any case, you've just paid 20 bucks for a burger and fries, so you'd hope it'd absolutely blow your mind. It's just OK.   Sushi is in the 'just OK' tier as well. Just your basic tempura, but at least it'll hit the spot at 1am! The happy hour pricing is a negligible difference, by the way, so don't go waiting for it!  In the end, this is a really cool place to hang out. The hours are hella convenient. Paying for that is justified, but goodness gracious let's stop acting like this food is anything above average. It's not."}
{"text":"Been to Delux a couple times on gourmet burger hankering. With a side of fries and a big selection of drafts (and misc comfort desserts/drinks), Delux delivers. There is a cool atmosphere, friendly service, and good food.  One item of note, they advertise Niman Ranch Beef, which many see as grass-fed. Their's is specifically listed as grain fed. So, while the treatment of the animals is still better than typical factory facilities, the diet isn't the same as grass fed. Hey, we can all make our own choices, it just kind of perturbs me to see \"vegetarian fed\" advertised when it is a non-issue -- grass fed is the standard."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but allot at least 2 hours for dinner. We came at about 10 and my friend still hasn't gotten her sushi at 11:30pm. There is only one chef. Weird! But ill be back!"}
{"text":"This place is tremendous! Oh my god! The burgers are amazing! The fries are amazing as well. Despite the cart of fries getting smaller the quality of the food is still there!!!"}
{"text":"Saw this place advertised on MSN.com as the best burger spot on Arizona so I gave it a tried and yes it was delicious. I got the Delux Burger and the classic burger, of them both I recommend the classic. The fries come in a super market cart which is makes it unique."}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment monthly and each time I set my taste buds free down the lager roller coaster they call a Flight.  Their beer selection is amazing and the atmosphere is trendy (but not pretentious).    This is a burger bar and they do burgers right!  If it's your first time, I highly recommend a burger and flight.  If you want to try something new, go for one of the focaccia sandwiches."}
{"text":"The only down to this place is the stripmall-esque location. But this is not your average burger joint. These are creative, high-end burgers. You have your choice of regular our sweet potato (not my cup of tea) fries, served in a mini table-top shopping cart. Great selection of beers and an AWESOME trendy bar. Definitely worth check-in out"}
{"text":"ok, so really. how can you go wrong with burgers? i guess it's a just little absurd to me that people dress up to eat a burger. or that people choose to drink a glass of pricey wine instead of say, a root beer float with their burger. speaking of which, their rootbeer float is too pricey for what you get....  at any rate, i took my brother to eat here once upon a time, for kicks and giggles. see what all the hype is about. we were actually seated really quickly on a busy night, and quickly ordered our burgers. they were good. that goes without saying. and i really enjoyed the decor and the fries in the mini shopping cart! yes, something so ridiculous it is adorable. i don't really like having to order fries separate, because i think they should just come with your burger, but i digress. the burgers were juicy, came out fast and piping hot, cooked to our specifications, and surprisingly, not too much more expensive than my childhood fave, red robbins. ok fine, at least their fries had yummalicious dipping sauces.  i'd go again, just not on a busy night. and maybe i'd dress up a little more. but then i'd feel crazy - like, why am i wearing a dress to eat a burger? but i do like those fancy-schmancy burgers... i guess i can suck it up."}
{"text":"Not often do I get to go for lunch downtown, had to find a place with a 'lunch' menu. This place is nice for lunch, it's not too crowded but has people to not feel like I've taken over the place.  I had the lunch cubano, basically a cubana sandwich. As people say, it's ham and cheese but it's weird, it's a pretty good ham and cheese sandwich. The toast haad texture of croutons.  The Cuban dinner is pork, rice+beans, plantains. They don't skimp on the salt. But the plantains were delicious, pork though is a bit dry.  I'd say the service could be more attentive. Though it's ossington, usually it's laid back. But they usually show you they care. This place, just laid back.  I like the \"art\" that is on the wall, particular the alphabet signage. I was corrected (not at the restaurant, by someone who I was telling about it) that it's \"typefaces\" not \"fonts\" that is the art. People in this area must like their \"typefaces\"."}
{"text":"Location: The restaurant  itself is really cute. I like that it's tucked into its own little corner, makes you forget you're in a strip mall area. Small patio but probably 7 tables. The two doors with different signs is a bit misleading it's all one establishment. Seems like over kill. 4  Service: Upon arrival the door was held open for me by the hostess. She was very friendly and smiled as I passed though. I was then greeted by the other hoatess she inquired about number of people in my party and promptly  took me to my table, by the door on the to go side. Not the most ideal seat at first but turned out to be nice as many people don't use that door. I was quickly greeted by our server, Patrick,  with menus. In told him I would look at them  and wait for my friend to arrive before ordering. He brought waters by soon. He was knowledgeable but he did talk a lot more than I would have wished and at the  end he said, \" I'd offer you two dessert but you ate plenty already so  I doubt you need it\". I was shocked. ALWAYS OFFER. I was on a date and it was like damn, is he calling me fat?? 3.5  Food: We only did sushi. It was good. Nothing memorable but good.  Writing this review a few days after and honestly can't tell you what I ordered. I love sushi and ate it again recently and can tell you every roll! So it was basic at best. 3   Presentation: food was presented neatly and quickly wait time was not long. Drinks wet offered once. Both  had a glass of wine. 4  We were satisfied when we left the restaurant.   I'd like to give a 3.5 due to service and food but I will go to a 4 because service change easily. Also, because I didn't try the burger and it's what they really are known for."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour and ordered the spicy tuna rolls (decent), sweet potato fries (decent) and a beer. The server was nice enough to let me try a few different beers before settling on one.   The food was standard and the two tuna rolls for $9 are a good price."}
{"text":"We were in the area and felt like a burger for lunch. Splitting the classic burger and an order of fries was the perfect serving size.  I like that they let us mix the regular and sweet potato fries.  For dessert we had a root beer float. It was OK but the root beer seemed a little flat and syrupy.  Overall, this is a pretty good place for a burger in the Biltmore area."}
{"text":"This place is essentially a copy of the old Father's Office (www.fathersoffice.com) in Brentwood, CA.  It took me a while to get over that fact and give it a decent try.  Among the things Delux has copied from FO is the famous \"Office Burger,\" which Delux calls the \"Delux Burger.\"  They also bring out the fries in a shopping cart just like Father's Office.  What Delux fails to copy, however, is the quality of the food and the high-end nature of the original.  At FO, the wines changed weekly and are all incredibly rare selections.  The beers at FO also tend towards the more obscure.  Delux seems to concentrate almost exclusively on beers and does have a decent selection, but nothing you can't find elsewhere.  Wines are available, but as an afterthought, and definitely not of the quality served at FO.  For Phoenicians who never experienced the joys associated with the original Father's Office, you're missing out.  It's like being an Eric Clapton fan but not even knowing who Muddy Waters is.  But all the imitation aside, I have to say that Delux does a pretty good job with everything and they have taken the FO concept and adapted it to the PHX strip mall environment.    Food wise, everything I have tried was ok.  They did change their sweet potato fries a year or two ago because the other ones weren't \"crispy\" enough.  The problem is that these new crispier ones have no flavor.  When they were testing out the new fries, the manager asked me and a friend to opine and we told him the truth: We said the new ones are flavorless.  I guess we were the only ones who thought so because they went ahead with that change.  That lost them 1 star from this review.  I would rather have the soggier more flavorful ones (who knows how they make these new ones so crispy anyways?).    When I go here, it's almost always out of convenience and late at night.  Not many places of this caliber stay open until 2 am, so it's about all there is when you are in need of a late night meal in this part of town.  Their 2 star rating is based on: clearly knocking off one of my favorite places, Father's Office (minus 1 star) and for ignoring my feedback on the new crispy tasteless sweet potato fries (minus 1 star).  They also lose a star for retaining the FO prices but substituting Phoenix strip mall quality."}
{"text":"family love the salads and mix of sweet and regular fries. always ummy. hard to get a good burger though. meat is to dense and buns to big, toppings to much. Always a wait to get mustard and the right amount of onions. They seem to have an aversion to giving raw onions. staff is usuallyl pleasant. Kind of over priced for value."}
{"text":"Decided to come give this place another try the weekend of Halloween, Douglas, I believe was our server.  He definitely did better as a server than our last few, but that doesn't say too much. He was very patient and attentive for the most part. We ordered 4 burgers a basket of mixed fries and a sushi roll. The sushi roll we ordered was terrible, I had to send it back. Definitely not worth the $16 or so they charge you for it. I can't remember what it's called but, it has a bunch of shrimp in ther, and topped with I believe a spicy mayo?  I've worked at alot of sushi places throughout my life and the size and the amount of shrimp they only give you, definitely isn't worth the money, and pretty bland even dipped in soy sauce with wasabi.  So all in all my experience was good, better service this time.  Burgers are always a 4 star. Sushi is a 1 star. Starting to think we should probably just order burgers to go."}
{"text":"Favorite joint for late night sushi and/or burger.  You can't  miss it if you're in scottsdale, pv or arcadia.  the chicken sandwich is delicious...strings of carrot and beet. Yum."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, veggie panini and the best sweet potato fries on the planet. Ask for extra spicy aioli, you will want it! Good selection of beers on tap with specials which rotate out monthly. It can get noisy inside but the patio is a great alternative, especially with the misters (in summer) or heaters (in winter)."}
{"text":"I am a regular. High quality meat, Nieman's  Great burgers, hot dog is out of this world. fun place, small but good. Want fabulous service, ask for Brad, he is the beat. This restaurant just added another side and now serves sushi too. Try it, it will not disappoint. Open till 2am I think."}
{"text":"Burgers are good but not stellar, but they do cook them like you ask. I would describe them as bland. Fries are fantastic as well as some of the appetizers.   Good selection of craft beers.  Everything is somewhat overpriced.  Seating is crowded and not very comfortable.  My favorite is that the grill stays open until 2 a.m. I have come in at 1:55 am and they will cook for you and give good service."}
{"text":"Best burger in the valley if you ask me. The service is sometimes hit or miss, but the food is amazing!   They now have a \"To Go\" half of the restaurant that has a more casual vibe than the main dining area/bar. They always have nice beer on tap, Ballast Point's Sculpin IPA is there right  meow, need I say more?  Fries - get the mixed basket of sweet potato and regular shoe string.  The creamy dipping sauce (CRanch?) is zingy and addicting - you've been warned! Delux Burger - Nieman Ranch beef definitely fresh, juicy, flavorful and the bread is so soft and perfectly toasted with complimenting sauteed onions.   This place has other yum things on the menu, but if it's your first time go with my recommendation. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"The staff rocks, as do the hours, as does the food. Even as a vegetarian, I  love hitting up Deluxe late night and grabbing a grilled cheese, fries, and a shake. They only have a few veg options, but they taste fabulous. Love this spot."}
{"text":"I love this place     , i have met the owner and he really cares And appreciates his customers. Food is great , and late late food for the servers and bartenderz thT work late.   My fav is the SUSHI is great. Also try the turkey burger is awesome!"}
{"text":"The only redeeming quality of this place is that they serve Papago Orange Blossom Wheat Beer.  I went here expecting something delicious. We had both heard good reviews, and are both burger fans so we were excited to see what Delux had to offer. Their menu was very limited in the burger region, with only two to choose from and no option to \"build your own burger\" like many burger places have. In addition, their burgers and other menu items are very over priced in my opinion. This restaurant takes pride in serving fresh ingredients. This may be true, but we both left feeling less than fresh. We were both nauseous, and the food resulted in me nearly throwing up a handfull of times.   We ordered two delux burgers; mine was served well done and his was served medium-well. Each burger came with a small side of fresh fruit. We also ordered the half and half fries. I was not impressed by the burger, and thought it was too sweet. I only ate half of mine.   After battling through hours of nausea, I called to speak with the manager. She refused to acknowledge that her establishment was the cause of our nausea and sickness. She told us to \"further investigate\" what he had consumed prior to eating there (but this was the first time we had hung out in 2 days due to complicated schedules- so it was the only meal we had shared). She kept saying to \"further investigate\" what could have made us sick, when we were both certain that it had been the food from Delux. The way that she handled the situation was less than professional, to the point of being insulting. She kept saying that they get their ingredients fresh daily, implying that since their ingredients were fresh, they couldn't have made us sick- which is absurd because there could have been one thing in there that was handled wrong or cooked incorrectly. Then she told me that she would \"further investigate\" with her head chef, and said she would call me back. She called me back less than 5 minutes later, which convinced me that she obviously didn't care and probably didn't check with the chef.   Personally, if I were the manager, I would have apologized for us not feeling well and I would have invited us to come in again, on the house, to try the restaurant again. Instead of handling it like this, she infuriated me beyond belief. The only reason I would ever go back would be to get the beer again, but I definitely wouldn't eat their food."}
{"text":"I honestly don't understand what all the hype about Delux is about. I honestly prefer Fez.   The meat is supposed to be this amazing, specially raised beef - that's all good, but could you maybe add some flavor/spice to it? I'm not sure they even added salt. Besides that, my bun was soaked with juice. Really? I've never even got that at Burger King.   The one positive thing I have to say, is that the atmosphere is pretty cool and they are open late. BUT..even though they are open late..it's not enough for me to go there even when late-night options are slim."}
{"text":"4 stars if you're a fan of soggy sweet potato fries.  3.5 stars if you are not...  I happen to be a fan of well done any kind of sweet potato fries, so Delux 2Go, you're lucky I'm not a tough critic!  (The fries were soggy but oh so yummy!)    I decided to go all out tonight and get a 'Delux Burger' and sweet potato fries (a 1/2 order was plenty).  I think that next time I will opt for the 'Standard Classic Burger' instead.  The caramelized onion and applewood smoked bacon mixture was a little much for me.  Not that the classic burger with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, and pickle isn't a heavy meal, but the delux toppings just made it seem much heavier and is sitting heavy in my stomach as I type!  I think this concept is great... I didn't have to wait to place my order and I ran over to Safeway (next door) to pick up a few necessities and when I returned, my order was ready.    The sandwiches, salads, and desserts were all looking appealing.  I will have to try those in future visits...  a girl can only eat so much!  I was also pleased to see that there is a limited menu from sister restaurant Zen 32 Sushi - sashimi combo (salmon, tuna, and yellowtail), california roll, vegetarian roll, and edamame.    For all of us yelpers that don't really grill or are just interested in picking up food rather than grocery shopping, preparing, cooking, and cleaning, Delux 2 Go is a great solution!"}
{"text":"Woah woah woah.  There are MUCH better burgers in the world!   I came here on the recommendation of a cab driver (don't mess with cabbies they know everything about a city) who said that he thought Delux had the best burger in the Phoenix area.  While this may be true since I did not get to try any other burgers while in Phoenix, I highly doubt that this is THE BEST in the Phoenix area ... I simply refuse to believe it.  The food wasn't bad.  It just wasn't great.  The only saving grace of Delux is that they had a really expansive and interesting selection of beers both on tap and in the bottle.  If I lived in Phoenix though, I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the most tasty French fries to ever touch my lips. Fun, upbeat atmosphere with a cool hipster vibe. Great craft beer selection too.   We went here planning to get sushi. But...we got sidetracked with a half order of mixed fries and 'mini burgers.' I'm not sure how a 4 oz. burger is considered mini, but it was pretty phenomenal, so who cares. Perfectly prepared, pink in the middle. I put some of the 'secret aioli' recipe sauce on it (comes with the fries)and, wow. We wanted to try 'My sister Sally's chocolate cake, so we skipped sushi and went straight to dessert. Our server suggested it warm and we said 'Go for it!' So glad we did.   If you're trying to decide where to go, just go here."}
{"text":"Such a good burger! I went with the Delux burger and it was very good. Cooked to perfection and seasoned well! The blue cheese was perfect and not overwhelming. Delicate onion flavor that enhances the over burger experience. Our waiter was super attentive and he keep my iced tea filled to the brim! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I recently tried their main burger and it was delicous. Good spicing and sauce. I got it without the bread as a lettuce wrap. I still haven't physically been to the place and just order through ubereats. My code for discount is  eats-mbdvx."}
{"text":"The Delux Burger, Cooked medium-rare, is the best burger I have ever had. Anywhere. Ever. If free-range fresh organic sirloin isn't enough, they mix in gruyere and gorgonzola, and top the thing with caramelized onions, bacon and ARUGULA! The plate comes with beautiful little grated curls of carrot and beet-root which are tasty atop the burger. Don't be a weenie and order a plain burger! Order the Delux. Medium rare.  Ask for extra chile aioli, you will want it for the sweet potato fries, trust me! The sweet potato fries are delicious, but I only order them to share because I am pretty sure this is a half pound burger and the fries for me alone are way too much food. The beet salad is also very good. Order the Delux Burger! Chimay on tap, so this COULD get spendy folks.   This ain't McDonalds.   The place can get annoyingly crowded and loud. It is very popular. try to get an outside table if you can."}
{"text":"I will admit I enjoy Delux burgers. I've been there a couple of times since they opened back in 2006? Anyhow, I tend to get the Delux burger and sweet potato fries. I will say the seating is a little limited. Furthermore, I've had subpar service mostly every time I've been there. They have recently added a sushi menu which I just do not understand. They state on the tables that it was at the customers request. The bf went ahead and ordered the Vegas roll (why I'm not too sure). anyway, I went ahead and tasted a piece and the smell alone had me question the freshness of the sushi and the batter was slightly soggy. I will stick to burgers at the burger joints and let the sushi places master their sushi, I'd advise this to any of my friends as well :) I'm pretty sure we'll be back but neither the service or the food really help it to be a regular stop."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, a little cramped but not too bad, fast service, great food, slightly overpriced, overall not too bad."}
{"text":"After a long awaited trip to Delux I was soooo disappointed.  Had only read great reviews about the wonderful burgers....well maybe they are but not on my visit.  Terrible service.  Cold burger (my melted cheese had hardened), soggy bun.  Don't think we will return anytime soon if at all."}
{"text":"This restaurant is  amazing!  The best Delux Hamburger. The best french fries- the best Chinese chicken salad. Oh you won't believe the amazing vanilla milkshakes. Be still my heart. The childhood memories of what it was is here in the flavor and quality My husband enjoys good Sushi. So this is the place we come. And he always is pleased with quality and quantity! Best in town so he says!   We like the genuine care you receive from where you sit to feeling ; no one is in a hurry to fill your booth and move you out!  The waitresses/ waiters are cream of the crop!  Lennie the owner never fails to pop by and say a few words. What s gem!  I cannot recommend a restaurant more . Great fresh, and always delicious  food consistently!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal here tonight!   My server, Xtian (Christian?), was really excellent. He checked on us continuously, yet never became annoying. He was friendly and polite without being too casual or over-the-top. I was really impressed with him.  My meal was also really good tonight. I ordered the panini grilled cheese and it had great flavor. It was so much more than just a regular grilled cheese. Unfortunately, my husband didn't enjoy his caprese salad much and reported that the tomatoes were pretty gross. Hey, at least I enjoyed my meal. ;)  Thanks for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"Great burger joint.   Went on vacation with my kids and they loved it as well. We will definitely go back when in town again."}
{"text":"Can you be a member of PHX yelp having NOT reviewed Delux?  This is like being jumped into Los Yelpes Gigantes.  Since Delux has been reviewed consistently for over two years, there is nothing that I can offer as a varied opinion, but i thought, what the hell?  I don't stop breathing air just cos everyone else has already done it.  Some things are necessary.  Delux is like your all-time favorite song.  Sure, you've had it over and over again, you know its intricacies, you've interpreted, and digested its offerings.  And then something happens that shocks you.  You get sick of it.  So, you stash it away, lose it on your memory's playback, and banish it from your favorite playlist.  Sometime later, it comes up again, and you think ... \"Oh yeahhhh!\"  This is Delux.    So you go back, get your usual pint of Anchor Steam, your maytag burger, and the halfer of sweet potato/boring potato fries.  Then you wonder why you ever shunned it.    This shit is great.  I won't ever dismiss it again.  Pretty soon, it will be a classic and you'll hear everyone talk stories about it, how they were there in 1972 when Delux opened for The Kinks."}
{"text":"They have tasty sushi, and burgers. I recommend going in at happy hour! Best place to visit late at night for good food."}
{"text":"Good food, good service and nice environment.  I ordered the hot dog with fries and had a Kemp's root beer to drink, for lunch.  The fries (regular not sweet potato) were excellent and the hot dog was pretty good, too.  The only thing that could be improved upon is the seating.  I sat at the long community table and I liked that idea, but the bar stools are bolted to the floor, so I had to sit an uncomfortable distance from the table.  At the least, I'd prefer to be able to move the bar stools.  The best change may be to get rid of the bar stools for more comfortable high seated chairs.  All in all a very good experience."}
{"text":"Dined here again today because coworkers wanted  to eat here. Well since I dined here last it has done nothing but get even worse. My food was so bad I just pushed it away after a few bites and had to ask a friend for a mint to get the vial flavor out of my mouth.  I had the Cool Chicken Salad Sandwich. The Bread was dry, the chicken dry, the mayo mixture was flavorless, the only thing that had any flavor was the slice of Swiss Cheese. What a waste of $12.00.  I give this place a below zero but Yelp won't let me do that!"}
{"text":"For me, it's always been 5 stars for both food and service every time I've been to Delux.  I love it here.  What's there not to love?  The menu is succinct and their pate/terrine/charcuterie appetizer is melt in your mouth.  Ordered the sauteed rapini, french fries and oysters on a half shell also as part of our appetizer round.  Being Good Friday, we had to order fish :)  So, out came the black cod with mussels in a bouillabaise broth.  Lastly, the donuts with creme anglaise was masterful.  And the 2 bottles of Chinon, poured and refilled constantly didn't hurt, either.  I will always recommend Delux - I will always go back - and I love this place."}
{"text":"AWESOME BURGERS! This is the top of the foodie chain. Fries were perfectly cooked, burger was amazing. Went with the house special and couldn't be better. WILL BE BACK!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Food/atmosphere/service all top notch. I would go here every week if I could. definitely on my top five fav places to eat in az :-)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite burger joint as Delux has the best burgers for taste.  I've never had a problem with the food here, only thing I find strange at times is sometimes the wait staff has a bit of an attitude, which is funny considering it's a burger place.  I know it's in the Biltmore-arcadia area but la de da.  This last visit was funny as I saw some parents bring a bunch of children here.  This does not seem like the type of place to bring your child, totally odd, but whatever rocks your boat."}
{"text":"Delux is awesome!!! Any place that serves a Hebrew National hot dog is A-motherfing-OK with me. It is the only kind of hot dog I will eat, being a good Jew and all. It comes with sauerkraut and choice of mustards, or whatever else you want on it. Their \"basket\" of sweet potato fries are on time as well. Literally a small metal shopping basket. I like them with regular ketchup, but they are served with a dipping sauce that is pretty good. I have had the Delux Burger once. It was good as well, but i always get the dog.   They have a great selection of beers, but I always go to the old standby; Stella Artois, in authentic glass and all. My none beer drinking friend Dally even gets some sort of fruity ale-type beer. So it has a good mix.   They have a pretty decent dessert menu as well. I have split the banana split sundae before and couldn't get through it all. It could probably feed 4 or 5.   Delux is great. It is open late, but can have a wait earlier in the evening."}
{"text":"Went here last night as my final blow out before I jump on the Fat Smash train. Amazing burger, I couldn't have asked for a better send off. I had my creation I love so much..the Caprese Burger, see previous review. Friggin' delicious!"}
{"text":"Great late night spot, the hours make it awesome.  Quality Sushi, love the sushi chef's, service is good all around, love the turkey burger & sweet potato fries as well as the dipping sauce.  Great location, great food, great service. I am a regular!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but one of the better burgers you'll find in the Phoenix metro area for sure. They offer sushi too but I've yet to try it. I have heard good things though. I absolutely love the Oriental salad and the variety of fries they offer here. Really great place for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"just what we needed on a HOT Phoenix Sunday afternoon !  sitting at the busy bar was perfect for service with a very professional and cool bartender/waiter named James made our lunch even better !  his attention to detail without hesitation was fantastic and actually made the whole lunch even better !  ( again )   without a doubt, the burgers here are the best in the city , juicy and tasteful and filling with NO Skimping at all !  the Delux burger is the best !  the salads are huge and worth sharing !  the place is clean and fun modern and with a place ti really kick back and enjoy your company . not too loud , just right !"}
{"text":"My girfriend and I have never had a bad experience here! Turkey burger is great, fries with the dipping sauce and all while sipping some Lindeman's , Pecheresse."}
{"text":"Delux is a restaurant I expected to be better than it actually was. The restaurant was not bad, but it also didn't strike me as particularly good. I really have nothing else to say about it."}
{"text":"I took my friend here for her birthday and I had been warned ahead of time that it gets expensive so I came strapped and prepared.  The atmosphere is great. Some nice exposed brick and an overall simple vibe, with a nice little bar and kitchen in the back. I felt comfortable as soon as I walked in and having two super-friendly servers made me feel even more at home. Our waiter was knowledgeable and genuinely seemed pleased to serve us! Started off with some Kronenbourg draft (one of my favourites that I seldom see at bars, let alone in draft form) but they only came in half-pints. Which I guess makes sense for a French restaurant.  Now the food tastes amazing... But I was a pretty hungry lad and the portions are very small. I ordered a romaine lettuce salad which was delicious, but it was very minimal. Same goes for the duck, which was the size of a baby chick. The flavours are out of this world though but I am a simple man and was looking for something more filling. So you might not want to assume going on an empty stomach is a smart plan.  We went full-on this night... We even had some dessert and fruit wine to end the evening. The dessert was fantastic. I had a coffee creme brule! In total we had appetizers, mains, dessert, a bottle of wine and dessert wine as well. For two people the total (with generous tip) was 260 dollars!  So definitely not for the poor. But if you want to impress someone on a date I can't recommend this place enough. I think the thing I was more impressed with was the service. It just couldn't get any better in my opinion. Mind you there were only about 3-4 other tables when we were there, so when the place is packed it might be slower. The overall vibe of Delux is perfect. Will definitely be coming back when I can afford to spend a bill on one dinner."}
{"text":"First time ever going to this place and  I LOVED IT  It's crazy to think you can have awesome sushi and an amazing burger in the same place. If you have not had a deluxe bigger then your missing out so delicious I ordered sushi which was amazing but I ended taking like 5 bites of my friends deluxe burger.    The service is great to our waiter was attentive fast and polite. I was unsure of what drink to order and he picked out the best one for my taste I will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The burgers, fries, and shakes are amazing! The atmosphere is nice too. I met the owner and he treated us to some sushi and was super kind and welcoming. I have been coming back to this amazing place ever since!"}
{"text":"Walked pass the tempting patio, misting a cool welcome.  Entered this contemporary restaurant, buzzing with upbeat music, food favorites, and brew fans.  Drank a perfectly poured Guinness, ate a shopping cart of french fries.  Loved the combo of sweet  and white potatoes.  Wished they would have stayed crispy longer."}
{"text":"My girl and I visit this place every time we fly in!! its a tradition! The fries and sweet potato fries come in a mini shopping cart basket and are bomb!!! Overall the food is great, the service is great, and the vide is chill! prices could be worked on... about a $1 or $2 above market prices for the same quality and style type restaurant. But a definite check out!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I love delux, sometimes I don't. The greatest variable usually being the service which is incredibly inconsistent. The staff  needs to learn you can be hip without being pretentious. (A seemingly difficult task, but obviously an art that has been mastered by many Phoenix proprietors.)   If the service was as up to snuff as the food, I would definitely have to bump up a star or two....I want to give a better rating, especially since the bathroom is awesome & always super clean and smells like home-baked goods, but service is just too crucial to overlook!"}
{"text":"I LOVE the Delux burger!  Plus it has Kolsh on tap which is awesome by me!  The rest of the menu.. not so exciting, but damn that burger is good!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best burger I have ever had.  Check Yelp for a good burger place and Delux looked best. Ordered a burger and on that first bite you always wonder what it will be like. So bit in hopefully and... It was the most amazing taste. I swear I heard angels sing. The burger was absolute heaven.  My wife had a panini and said it was very good.  The fries were so-so.  Giant selection of beer. Got a couple of samples and then had a new one (Green River Street something) that was really good. The selection is really varied so you should definitely find one you'll like.  Really nice seating & decor."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had! Fun atmosphere, and a great selection of beers on tap. Anytime I'm in Phoenix I have to make a stop, even if it's a hour out of the way. I always get the classic burger. The bun is amazingly and the beef has wonderful flavor."}
{"text":"I didn't think this place lived up to what it's known for.... BURGERS!  It was suppose to be this great place to have burgers, we get there to find only three burgers on the menu... kind of a let down. And they weren't anything special. Not to mention it was very dark inside. The only cool thing about it was that the fries came in this tiny grocery cart shaped baskets..."}
{"text":"the servers worked as a team, thought that was cool. they were great. the food, always good.. the croquettes..sandwich, pickerel and gnudi were yummmmmy :) and pllllease get the donuts... mmmmm.... donut."}
{"text":"Nice upscale joint but service is way below par. Took a lot to get the waiter's attention, he didn't even serve me my food, I had to signal the cook to serve it to me as it was just sitting on the hot plate with the waiter nowhere to be seen. Food was good though. Most likely will not return here."}
{"text":"I am so grateful for this wonderful eatery. I love the quality and atmosphere. I'm truly thankful that it stays open late and serves amazing sushi or fine burgers into the wee hours.  Never disappointed with the ample portions and smiling service. A hit!! With a full bar to keep the spirits high. Happy hour and reverse happy hour ( after 10 PM) offers such a huge discount on fresh tasty sushi and beer it's difficult not to justify pigging out just once in a while. Or maybe twice in a while.  Yummm!"}
{"text":"This place continues to be a great late night option while in the Biltmore area.  Coming from a larger city when I visit the Phoenix area I tend to dine late.  Apparently this concept is lost in the valley of the sun other than Delux.  They are open until 2am and serve burgers and sushi as well as drinks.  I know what you are thinking burgers and sushi?  Let me tell you the sushi is very decent and I am extremely critical of sushi in Phoenix and Scottsdale.  Its fresh and tasty...what else do you need at 1am when the streets are barren and everything is closed.  Thank god for Delux."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Since moving to Phoenix it's been hard to find late-nate sushi and I will drive to this place as they're open until 2 am and get my sushi-fixed be it alone or with friends. I haven't had too much of their non-sushi items, but the burger and fries were really good as well. Most nights the service is great and you will remember your waiter/waitress."}
{"text":"It appears that the point where Ossington meets Queen is not just reserved for really shady looking karaoke bars and the mentally ill (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/camh---community-services-toronto).  Not only do we have a dandy drinking hole in Sweaty Betty's (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/sweaty-bettys-toronto), but we also have a newly-opened restaurant that serves up dandy food in the form of Delux.  One of the fun things about Delux is that you need to know its there in order to find it.  Hiding on Ossington doesn't really help, and neither does a street sign with a single arrow pointing to the door, unless you know where you're going.  Your ability to find the place will be a rich reward.  No worries.  Once your in, you're taken away from the albeit roughness of Ossington to a modern monochromatic dining area.  Seating is ample, and the food rich and well plated.  I ended up ordering the duck off the menu upon recommendation by the servers and was anything but disappointed.  The freshness of the ingredients is showcased prominently in the resultant dishes.  The wine list is ample.  The post-supper liquors and liqueurs are sufficient.  The restaurant as a whole is so inviting it can easily be the focus of the evening instead of a part of a larger night.  Worth fighting your way down Ossington for."}
{"text":"Love this place! We go here a few times a month usually for the late night sushi. I've had a little bit of everything at this place!! Sushi is fresh! Veggie burger is really good and little shopping karts of fries are adorable!"}
{"text":"Delux was on my hubby's bookmarks and we were looking to try something new, so we ended up here! The parking lot was a bit tough to navigate since it's a busy spot and finding an open spot took a few minutes, but we ended up close-by.  We headed on in, and the place was on the smaller side, but we were seated right away inside at a two person table.    Our server was Mario and he was really helpful in walking us through any questions we had about the menu or options. The space itself felt crowded despite it not being full of people since there are tons of seats, decor, staff, bar space taking up every nook and cranny. But the fun ambiance and all the things to look at are fun at the same time.  We both opted for the Delux Burger and decided to share an order of fries. We hesitated to see that the burgers were roughly $12 and didn't come with any sides, but once we got our plates, it made a lot more sense. The burgers are gigantic and there are two of them on the plate! The fries come in an adorable \"shopping cart\" and they were cooked perfectly.    They had dessert options, but we were pretty full and decided against it, but will know better for next time!  Overall: A Definitely a winner among the various burger bars in the area!"}
{"text":"Came into this place on St Patrick's Day because Keegan's was too busy. Walked inside and my husband and I were seated right away. You would think that a restaurant that serves both sushi and burgers wouldn't be that good, but let me tell you! We only got the avocado roll for sushi but it was so good! Husband and I both got burgers after with a basket of fries. First of all, they come out in an actual basket! Cutest and coolest thing ever, I freaked out. I got the delux burger and my husband got the turkey burger. His was pretty messy but so delicious. As  for mine, it was medium rare and tasted like butter. On top of the great food, our waitress was the sweetest ever. So kind and helpful, I think her name was Autumn. We noticed that they're open til 2 am! So this would be the perfect spot for a late night snack. I believe they have a late night happy hour starting after 10. Needless to say, we will definitely be going back! Also must mention that I loved the environment, very trendy and cool inside. Not too loud."}
{"text":"I like delux.  Their food is always consistent, prices are reasonable and the service is good but not ever memorable.  I always get the delux burger with mixed fries.  It never seems to disappoint.  I've tried their asian chicken salad and that is pretty tasty too.  During lunch times or weekends, it can get busy and parking is limited."}
{"text":"CHARCUTERIE PLATE This was nice. To be honest, I wasn't sure what I was having, but it was all very delicious and flavourful. Nothing was overly gamey. The flavours were subtle and delicate.  DUCK CONFIT Heavenly. The way duck confit ought to be. The meat fell right off of the bone. It was so tender and moist, unlike the way many places make duck (dry and tough!). The duck was served on a bed of brussel sprout greens, which was a nice, tender touch. The slice of grilled eggplant was a nice contrast to the pretty salty duck. I want the confit again. And again.  THE STEAK Oh, goodness. That steak was so tender and buttery. The flavour of the meat was just right - tasted of good quality beef and none of that \"meaty\" flavour. Just lovely.  CUBAN COFFEE CREME BRULEE Oh yes. Oh, what a creme brulee. So silky and aromatic. It was rich and thick...so satisfying. The silkiness was a wonderful oral experience.   DONUTS People love these donuts. I didn't. I mean, they were good, but I found too much of a oily/greasy taste to them. They were obviously deep-fried because all good donuts are deep-fried...but no good donuts taste of the grease! And I found these ones did. However, like I mentioned, I know people really, really enjoy these."}
{"text":"If you love burgers than you should eat here at least one time, especially if you love sweet potato fries!  Just get their standard issue burger with a \"basket\" of sweet potato fries.  Literally, it's a shopping cart basket filled with their fries.  It comes with this orange sauce that's amazing.  They'll cook your burger any way you want it so if you're the kind of person who wants the beef still mooing, they'll bring you the cow."}
{"text":"Delux, seriously. It's well-done. The kitchen stays open until 2am and the Grilled Cheese is out of this \"californian cuisine\" galaxy. I had to switch from the Delux Burger because I think it stopped my heart for a few seconds in my sleep the night I decided to take it all in. I'm usually just here for the beer anyways and it's not bad with 17+ on tap.  No can do on Friday/ Saturday night. The wait will be an hour. Yes, still.  Shut up you CenPho/ Biltmore trendsters.... oh wait."}
{"text":"Stopped in for for a quick bite being that what I was really craving was closed for remodeling. Sat at the bar and thinking since it was past the lunch hour it wouldn't be busy (and it wasn't) yet it was a good 4 minutes before I was even greeted.   Ordered a turkey burger, added cheese and mushrooms ($3.50 extra seriously?!?) and got a half order of fries (mixed)  Fries were better plain as sauce was pretty bland.  Burger came with a side of some pico de gallo that had zero taste to it as well as a garlic aioli that a little flavor but nothing to really write home about.  The only thing that was salvaged was the bartender redeemed him self and was pretty attentive after taking so long to get to me.  I gotta say I'm not quite sure I would go back anytime soon. For what I paid I'm just not that impressed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Sunday night go with the family in shorts place!!! Menu is small but doesn't have to be any bigger.  Just get a burger, the sweet potato fries and kick back with a beer or 2. The only complaint is that I end up eating too many fries before the burger comes and I am full.   I would go every night if I didn't care how much I weigh."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my wife who works in the area. The place was loud & crowded. We waited 10 minutes to be seated and the service went downhill from there. I ordered a beer, server asked for my ID, which I handed him, and he ran off with it (I assumed to check it). 5 minutes later he returns with my ID but not my beer! I finally got my beer shortly after.   The food is overpriced and marginal at best. It seems like it is a place to go to be seen as long as you don't care about mediocre food at a Biltmore district price.   When we were ready to leave, we waited for the bill. Then waited some more. Then more waiting. The group of 4 next to us at the table was in the same boat - where is our server & our bill? I finally got up, walked over to the manager & asked for our bill and the bill for the party next to us. He of course apologized. We paid, which took the server way too long to process, and left.   I will not be back & I doubt the party next to us will be either."}
{"text":"I have been here three times lately and just don't love it. They really push the all natural Niman Ranch beef thing, but how about making those burgers taste great!?  They basically have two beef burgers to choose from, classic and delux. I had the classic on my previous visit and it was good. Tonight I had the delux and it wasn't so good. Despite the delicious toppings on the delux it really didn't have any flavor. I would rather have a burger full of hormones and chemicals that tastes great!  Be aware that the delux burger is served on a baguette instead of a hamburger bun, some might find this to be a turn off.  Sushi is also available here and it's pretty good. Yes, this is also a sushi restaurant! It's sort of split sushi side/burger side but you can order either or both wherever you are seated.   They have great cocktails, even martinis. French fries are very good and they serve a large portion.   You can't beat the late night hours at Delux! They are open and serve food until 2:00AM. Great concept, the burgers just need to improve a bit."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. It has more French offerings than Cuban, aside from the yummy Cubano sandwich, but everything is done very well.  It's trendy without being pretentious - just a clean, modern cool. Two of my dinner companions heralding from New York likened it to a hip Soho eatery, and I cannot disagree.  The duck confit and steak frites, two classic French dishes to which one can measure by, are fantastic."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Amazing food selection. Awesome beer specials.   i have tried the Grilled Cheese & Turkey Burgers and both were amazing. SWEET POTATO FRIES! To die for!  Don't skip this place, :)"}
{"text":"My wife finally got me to come here, as she claimed it was the best burger. Turns out it is not the same as Delux in Canada, (which I had several times) and now I am a full on Delux addict!!! It is the best burger you will ever have in your life. If you're lucky you will get Douglas as your server, he's definitely the best. So regardless if you're a visitor or resident of Phoenix go to Delux and indulge in burger heaven!"}
{"text":"the burgers are GREAT!! and the vanilla bean beer is good. the fries are better then most. it has the snottsdale vibe but not as bad as most spots \"in snottsdale\" the waiters kinda give that \"I want a huge tip just because\" service. I like the food but not the vibe.. lets be clear.. they may have the best burger in town despite of all the other BS."}
{"text":"I had nothing but a burger... touted as the best burger in the Phoenix area, what did I get?  Well, it might be up there.  The texture was great though the sauce on the burger was likely unnecessary.  They cooked the burger perfectly (this is a huge huge requirement for a burger joint).  I don't know what or how they did it, but even though its a tad bit pricey for what it is I'd definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This is my first time having their food, and let me say everything was sheer perfection.   My spouse and I ordered: the Chinese chicken salad and the Delux Burger medium and fries.   The Chinese chicken salad was delicious. They give you a huge portion. This salad is loaded with flavor--Sweet, spicy, fresh, crunchy. I was so full and literally couldn't stop eating it.   The burger was cooked a little under than what my fiancé preferred, but it did not stop him from devouring it. And it was an extremely big burger! And the fries were crispy and seasoned very well.   It's definitely worth visiting and I will definitely be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for everyone. My boyfriend is a burger and fries type of guy, and he's tried practically every burger in town but the delux burger is his favorite! The fries are also delicious, I like the mixed basket, and they come with a yummy sauce (and I don't typically like French fries!). I personally love sushi, and wasn't expecting much coming into a burger joint for sushi, but I was wrong! My Dragon roll was delicious! It was a very large roll as well, so come hungry. Service was fantastic, our waitor came back to check on us multiple times and neither of our glasses was ever less than half full!"}
{"text":"As soon as we touched down in PHX and picked up our rental car, we headed to Delux for some late night grubb.  I was hungry but my other half wasn't as she ate on the flight to PHX.  Upon entering, we were promptly seated.  The ambiance is very nice.    We ordered a Delux burger, sweet potato fries, and a gazpacho soup.  The sweet potato fries came out first, and it was great start to the meal.  The Delux burger and soup came out a few minutes later.   The Delux burger was good, but not great.  The meat was prepared just about right and the burger was the right amount for the price but honestly I've had better.  The soup like a crushed bowl of salsa with a nice kick to it.   One thing that stood out about this place was the service.  Our server Brad took very good care of us and ensured that we were happy and taken care of.  I would recommend Delux as a nice late night to eat at."}
{"text":"Delicious food, a little expensive."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it here! Where else can you get sushi and a burger at the same place?! We ordered the delux burger which was so delicious and juicy. We also ordered a philly roll which was absolutely perfect. Very cute ambiance and lighting. They are also open for food very late at night. Definitely recommend this."}
{"text":"The fries are amazing! Hope you aren't expecting a good burger though. They have obscenely tough breads and normally come out overcooked. Not only are they hard to eat, but they are overly buttery and not all that flavorful. The double stack from wendy's is tastier every time..."}
{"text":"This place was built up quite a bit to me for a long time before I ever had the opportunity to go check it out for myself. The build, for whatever reason, gave me the impression it was going to be a dimly lit bar with techno beats bumping from inside.   What I found when I finally went there was a clean, well organized diner with some killer hamburgers and good salads. In many respects, it was better that I expected it to be.   I highly recommend the sweet potato french fries with chipotle mayo, as well as any of their burgers. But stick with the beef, as the only legitimate knock here are the chicken sandwiches."}
{"text":"Voted \"Best Burger,\" by the Phoenix Magazine, January 09 Dining Guide issue, Delux's Delux Burger was far from the best. The burger was nothing more than an under-seasoned and over-cooked beef patty confined in an oversized soggy baguette.   The burger is supposed to have been dressed with organic rocket, caramelized onions, applewood-smoked bacon and blue and gruyere cheeses. Should have had a lot of flavor, right? But it didn't. The only identifiable flavor was the sweetness of the caramelized onions.   Also, the roasted beet salad was overdressed and soggy. If it wasn't for the texture of the beets I wouldn't have known they were there.  The sweet and earthy flavor that I was hoping for was lost due to the overabundance of the salty blue cheese and sweet balsamic vinaigrette.   Delux does have a couple things going for them: a pretty cool ambience, an extensive drink menu, and they serve up a refreshingly cold glass of H2o."}
{"text":"Absolutely love these burgers. Maybe my favorite burger of all time.  The first time I went I had the regular burger.  It was good, but wasn't blown away.  Then...I tried the Delux Burger.  Wow.  I'm talkin', \"Holy Shit Wow!\"  It's that good.  (Ok, so I used that expression in a previous review, but it applies here as well)   The meat is so fresh and so good.  The bun is great. The baby arugla is a nice touch, making it stand out from all other burgers.  Here's how the menu describes their burger...  \"fresh ground, all natural, grain fed certified premium beef, maytag bleu cheese and gruyere cheese blend, caramelized onion with applewood smoked bacon mixture and baby arugula served on a hand crafted toasted demi-baguette. [lettuce wrap available]\"  They recommend the burger prepared medium-rare and I agree.  Gotta try the fries with the aioli sauce.  I suggest dipping the burger in the aioli too!  I am starting to crave one now just writing this."}
{"text":"Interesting concept for a burger joint.  I was expecting to wait to eat at such a trendy-looking restaurant, but we were seated immediately at our choice of patio or inside.  We opted for the patio.   The waiter seemed distracted and didn't know much about the expansive beer list.  If you pride yourself on beer (Delux has over 40), you best know your shit. We ordered a beer flight, with our choice of three--this satiated my indecisiveness when it comes to ordering...  The menu was limited.  I was expecting many more creative burgers than the five or six listed (only two of which were actual beef burgers).  I guess if you do the burger right, you don't need many to choose from.    My dining companion and I split the chopped Asian salad and the turkey burger.  The salad was very tasty and was enough for two large helpings for each of us (and then some).  I'm always hesitant to order a turkey burger for fear of crumbly, dry meat.  We took a chance and it came out moist and flavorful.  The burger arrived cut into halves, which made divvying it up easy.  Plus, it came with non-fat cilantro aioli and pico de gallo (I love my sauces!).  We were happy campers.    The setup of the patio is awkward. There is no flow whatsoever.  Our waiter slammed an opposing chair into my knee, and I felt like I had to crawl over people sitting at surrounding tables just to get to the bathroom.  Also interesting was the communal sink outside of the restrooms.  It's a restaurant...not a club.   I'm curious to try other items.  I'll be back, but it's not the first thing on my list."}
{"text":"This place I highly recommend! Burgers or Sushi! And its amazing!"}
{"text":"Delicious. Got the delux burger and sweet potato fries. They were friendly and the food was ready relatively fast. The burger was a little undercooked for medium rare but not bad. It's a little pricey, but I was starving."}
{"text":"We love Delux. They may be overpriced (hence the 4 stars) but the fries and the aioli are perfect and the burgers are delicious. We always receive great service here. On our last visit, the manager took care of us and treated us to free cookies at the end of our meal. The beer selection is fabulous and there's something for everyone. We only go a few times a year, since it's expensive, but we always enjoy it."}
{"text":"I had the crispy duck confit and a glass of chardonnay, and was for the most part quite satisfied with my meal. I was a little amused by the Urban Outfitters aesthetic of the waitstaff, but the gentlemen servicing our table were for the most part friendly and helpful. I will concede that the food is a touch overpriced, but once you indulge in the refined, exotic flavors, money sort of becomes a non-issue. Ambiance was fairly relaxed and there wasn't an overhanging sense that one had to \"put up appearances\". I would go back again."}
{"text":"This place needs another good review like a hole in the head, but too bad. Any place that my uber-picky, easily disgruntled, vociferously opinionated tipsy father finds no fault with should be heralded with a choir.   The Deluxtini, which you feel like a dumbass ordering, is some concoction of orange vodka, pineapple juice, champagne, and peach nectar. $11 sounds like a lot until you see the shaker that comes out with it -- easily, there's three full martini glasses' worth in it. Okay, I was solidly buzzed. The beer list is huge, and they have my SO's Chimay, so bonus points there.  I love sweet potato fries, even these, which were a bit on the flaccid side. The much-heralded orange sauce is tasty as well. The roasted vegetable panini was excellent, but not quite cheesy enough; next time I will stick with the grilled cheese panini, which is a fatty bit of heaven. My dad and SO split a burger and the caprese panini, and again, both seemed relatively content, a rarity.  Dessert (chocolate cake and a vanilla malt) and coffee were generously portioned and delicious.   Our server was fabulous - very helpful, friendly, genuine, and never once tried to rush us out of there, even when it got super busy. Oh yeah, and we get to the minus-one-star area: it's fucking busy. The parking lot is a Range Rover disaster waiting to happen. The whole shopping center is really a trendy yuppie Mecca - pure chaos.  Getting there early, as we did, circumvented some of that, but in general - it's verging on a Xanax moment."}
{"text":"CONS: the crowd - it can get really busy so I try to go right at 11 on Saturdays, but never on a Friday! The parking can also be a b!tch. The seating is cozy and tight, so if you're not ready to make friends with your neighbor this place is not for you.  PROS: GREAT food! My favorites include the Delux burger( but don';t let the bacon in the description fool you...its just a miniscule amount, if you want bacon on your burger order it extra), sweet potato fries (the best!), the homemade root bear, the shakes, the chinese chicken salad and the beet salad."}
{"text":"this establishment is very modern.  almost too modern for my taste BUT the food was damn good!  it seems like whenever we go it's hard to find parking and there is a 30-60 minute wait.  the service is always good and professional.  we always go for any burger and the sweet potato fries.  we also order desserts too.  our bill for 2 adults is usually around $40.  it's too bad that other folks have had bad experiences regarding quality of food and service.  dang it, now i got sweet potato fries on my mind!!!!"}
{"text":"that burger and those regular/sweet potato fries super tasty get the caramelized onions on your burger"}
{"text":"We came here for their reverse happy hour. Our server was very attentive, nice, and friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a great late happy hour. Not to mention the food is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time tonight, excellent food and beers!  I got the turkey burger, it was really good and their fries are amazing!  I will definitely be going back!  Oh, and I had a sip of someone's vanilla shake, if you like shakes these were pretty amazing too!"}
{"text":"Excellent meat sourced from the same farms that supply Chipotle.  The burgers are wonderful masterpieces of beef.  I would say this is easily the most succulent tender flavorful burger I have had to date.  The mix of sweet potato fries and regular fries come in a cute lil shopping cart.  The service was great as well.  Well worth going to."}
{"text":"We ate at Delux over the weekend. Great meal!  Dinner dining seems more focused to French style food than Cuban although they had a cubano sandwich as an appetizer.   The lunch menu on the wall leads me to believe that it is very Cuban focused for the noon-crowd.   As for dinner -- things to love:  - STEAK FRITES - my hubby had these and they looked good and tasted good. Meat was cooked perfectly, frites were crispy on the outside.  - CHARCUTERIE PLATE - OMG --- was so good, three different options, and way to much to eat alone unless you are very hungry -- so perfect for sharing. Came with lots of toast points. We had chicken liver mouse, another soft pate and a coarse country pate - pickled raisins and cournichons on the side.  - DUCK CONFIT - I had this and it was good. It is a smaller helping than the steak/frites but I was good with that. Crispy skin, moist meat and on top of grilled eggplant and some greens. Had some kind of \"jus\" that just made it wonderful.   They had good selection of wines - some at good price point. The Crianza we picked went well with our food.   DESSERT -- you must try the doughnut holes with chantilly cream. They came warm -- sooooo good.   SEATING - ATMOSPHERE -  In the front -- note that the booths are tight seating and also the side seating is close (right on top of your neighbour!)   In the back - much more room (no booths) and very comfortable. We sat back here and enjoyed it very much.   PARKING - street parking only   Not a huge space so if you can reserve or go early - do so -- place fills up quickly.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It's been a while since I've been to Delux, but I do keep meaning to go back. Their burgers are a nice change of pace from the typical fast food variety. Order up a \"basket\" (served in a miniature shopping cart) of sweet potato french fries and you have a not-so-ordinary dining experience.  Beer. Beer, beer and more beer. So much beer that the sheer volume of it outnumbers the rest of the items on the menu. From Microwbrews to Michelob, you're sure to find something cold and refreshing. The sweet raspberry lambic is a nice way to top off your meal.  The interior is a bit small and it's often crowded and very noisy. Carrying on a conversation inside when it's busy is next to impossible without having to shout. If you can get a seat outside, I would go for it. Keep in mind that Delux is located in a strip mall so you'll be constantly barraged with cars driving by."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out for ages. What a mediocre experience. Wednesday night, no reservations, the place was pretty dead. We went in at around 7:30. So if there was dinner rush it would have happened. There is plenty of room and we get sandwiched beside a bunch of other two tops. I may as well have been sitting at a picnic table. No intimacy at all. I watched as the restaurant continued to be empty. Longing for a booth across the way.   So this place is pricey. I don't mind paying if the food is spectacular. We ordered the fish cakes. they were yummy. but for 12 dollars, they were the size of 3 small meatballs. My entree was the Cuban sandwich( I keep hearing is amazing ) 14 dollars without a side! Had to order fries for another $5 It amounted to grilled cheese/ham and pickle sandwich that was so greasy I could not eat it, with a side of soggy cress.  My friend did not fair much better. Pork Belly with white beans. $24 literally a slab of braised bacon on a half cup of beans. MEH! He ended up finishing my fries ( also disgustingly greasy) because he was still hungry.   After two glasses of wine, and our meals, I was blow away that our bill was $120 plus tip. Ouch! Yeah, as I said I have no problem paying for a great meal. I would have done better at the Lake view down the street if I wanted that much grease. for a quarter of the price."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last night since I was craving some sweet potato fries and one of my friends have told me they have awesome sweet potato fries. Came here around 11 pm and they have happy hour from 10 p- close!  The place looks cool! There is patio seating, bar, sushi bar, and dining area. It seems like each seating area has a different ambience, so I would love to go back sometime and sit at another spot. We sat at the sushi bar this time because we get complimentary hot sake, pale ale, or house wine. How awesome is that?!  We weren't too hungry when we arrived, so ordered a basket of sweet potato fries and two mini burgers. The shopping cart of fries is just too cute. The yellow dipping sauce that comes with the fries was so good! The burgers were very good as well...the meat was juicy and I love the bun!!!!   Given that...I would go back again!"}
{"text":"I had the Jumbo Hotdog. It was great! I loved that I could order my French fries mixed (regular & Sweet potato)"}
{"text":"Very hard to get a burger here medium rare. The service was excellent, and I felt bad because I had to send it back. Chef needs to focus. Fries were yummy."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here I had to chime in.  WHAT ABOUT THE BEERS?  OMG soooo many imported brews on tap served in the appropriate glassware?  This is awesome!!!  Not to mention that everything on the menu here comes out to less money than the god awful Fudrucker's that so many cardboard people in Phoenix adore.  I wont even go into my dreaded $13 lunch experience there.  EW!  An amazing burger for 9 bucks.  A shared basket of fries for 5.  10 or 12 beers at 4.75 each?  This is a dream come true.  If you don't look out the window you can even forget you are in a parking lot.  This place is even open late so after a night of bar hopping and parking lot traversing you can still pop in here and get a burger and beer in appealing surroundings.  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Spent my 2015 New Year's here, and I don't have any complaints!  Walking in, I was taken by the trendy lighting and decor along with cozy booths that make the place feel intimate despite the open design.  Quick and attentive service was consistent during our whole meal.  Our party ordered the Bruschetta as a starter and a Delux Basket of Mixed Fries to share. The Bruschetta was wonderful; crispy baguette slices topped with perfectly textured tomatoes. I could have eaten just that for dinner and been happy. The Mixed Fries were good - I was especially surprised that the sweet potato fries were crispy. The accompanying housemade sauce was delicious.  For our main eats we ordered The Classic and Delux Burgers. Our pescetarian friend ordered a California Roll, Shrimp Tempura, and Spicy Tuna.  My burger (the Delux) was delicious. The burger had a nice, perfectly seasoned flavor, and a good amount of chew texture-wise. I especially enjoyed the caramelized onions and applewood bacon that top the Delux Burger. If I'm ever in Phoenix again I'd order another for sure.  Two of use decided to ring in the New Year with Deluxtinis. If you're looking for something that is sweet and packs a roundhouse kick to the senses, get the Deluxtini.  Orange flavored vodka, peach schnapps, pineapple juice, and champagne are all mixed up and served to you in a classic martini glass. This drink is STRONG, and if you don't enjoy the taste of vodka it might be off-putting; if you are into drinks that aren't too sweet but have a lot of fruity flavor I'd recommend the Deluxtini.  All in all, Delux left a great impression on me. The food was good, and we had great service. If I lived in the area, it'd be a regular happy hour spot as they have not one, but two!"}
{"text":"Going with the 4 stars on this one.  We've been there 3 times... the first two times the burgers were off the charts good. Love the beef there... just on another level.  We did have an off night... burgers were a little dry... so... knocked the review down a star.  the sweet potato fries are great! Burgers are very flavorful and just all around great.  Drop in and give this place a try.  It's not very big... I would suggest you go during the week and avoid it on the weekends or Friday night. Very busy!  But... just go... if you like a really good burger... this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My burger tasted like a wet dog smells. The french fries came in a shopping cart."}
{"text":"Delux is our favorite burger place and we don't even live near their location. We always get a classic burger plus bacon and a Delux burger. We also love the sweet potato fries as a side and we like to sit at the bar for the consistently great service. The beer selection is really good too. I like Green Flash or Stone but they are sure to have something you will like (unless you like standard domestics b/c they don't have those.)"}
{"text":"Delux has been hands down one of my most fundamental locations to frequent. The owner and his marketing manager have gone above and beyond in making every experience memorable and exciting.  Thank you Lenny and Mac.   I recommend this place for dates (ambiance) as well as casual get togethers.  Ask for the bloody Mary's hands down the best!!   Z."}
{"text":"If I'm looking to step it up from your drive thru burger joint, Delux is definitely the place that hits the spot. The signature Delux Burger with sweet potato fries are absolutely mouth watering. The little added novelty of the sweet potato's coming in a mini grocery cart was also a nice touch accompanied by a nice aioli sauce to dip in. Now I'm not a fan of onions, let alone grilled onions by all means, but the waiter talked me into them and I'm glad he did. The carmelized onions were a nice texture touch to the burger and infused the burger with more flavor.   After what I felt like, was inhaling my delicious burger, we had a apple cinnamon cookie with a glass of milk. Such a great finish to a great burger. A nice 'fancy' touch to comfort food indeed."}
{"text":"Cool, hip and happening ... sure. I was impressed when my friend took me here after noticing how I pay attention to good places to dine. We were in hamburger mode and Delux was just what we were looking for.  The atmosphere was trendy, busy but not packed and overall had a good vibe. We sat in the outside patio area after a short 20 min wait on a Friday night. I immediately liked the place just on their drinks menu. I really appreciated the fact that they are descriptive about their drink selections. Nice touch indeed.  So I got the turkey burger and it was pretty good even though I wasn't digging the bun too much. We got a mix portion of the sweet and regular potato fries in what seems to be their signature container - the mini shopping cart. Overall the food was above average and worthy of high praise.  I plan to visit the Phoenix area from time to time and I certainly will need a repeat visit to Delux. They were just that good!"}
{"text":"Okay, I'm from L.A. where we have possibly the greatest burger I ever had from Father's Office.  But if I hadn't had that burger mere days before I had Delux's burger, then I would say this is the greatest.  The difference?  Father's Office is aged beef.  And I didn't taste that in the burger at Delux.  The Delux has carmelized onions, arugla, and seemed a little bit over cooked. If I hadn't had the recent experience, I would say it was way up there. I would try to order a different bun or maybe it get it with the lettuce wrap because I didn't really think the foccacia went with the burger. I think it's fun they served the fries in shopping carts (maybe it's a trendoid yuppie thing).  My friend who had the salad said there wasn't enough nuts in it for protein.  Hmm, possibly this is not the place to go if you're vegetarian.   My other friend who had a walker had a lot of trouble maneuvering in and out of the tight table the put us at near the front and though the staff was trying to be nice, they didn't know how to deal with it.    My friends also felt it was really loud but I didn't think it was.  Maybe my hearing is gone.  Wha?"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, all natural beef, great salads, nice staff... And an excellent beer selection!"}
{"text":"Went there for brunch and left there pretty disappointed. The place is a little small, would have wish to have a little more space for my elbows so they don't end up on the neighbours face. Service was not that great. The server brought us the wrong plate out. Never asked us if the food was ok, or refill our water.The wait was a little long, (for food and bill) We've ordered 3 different dish to share.  The famous duck confit hash was the biggest disappointment ever. To the point that we have to asked the server if they had brought us the wrong plate again, because the plate has nothing reminiscent of any hash and the duck was nowhere to be found. The plate look more like a giant portion of rice and bean with an egg on top. The server confirm that it was the right dish and started to point out with his finger the tiny little shredded pieces of duck mixed in the chopped potato pieces. Not only it was small, but it was also tasteless. The potato was nothing like a hash, it was just some chopped up soggy and blend potatoes. We've also ordered the 2 eggs with some house made chorizo that was served with, again, rice and beans. The chorizo taste more like an italian sausage. Another disappointment. On the other hand, I really enjoyed the French toast with banana dulce de leche. however, my two friends hated that one as well. Guess we won't be coming back. BEWARE: the steep stairs down to the washroom was like a trip down to hell!"}
{"text":"Delux is absolutely awesome. Every single burger they have is amazing. The fries in the carts are super cute and super instagrammable. The just recently remodeled and it looks great it's just a pretty small place but they also have outdoor seating. Servers are always great and extremely attentive. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great place to come and enjoy a well cooked burger some delicious fries and an ice cold beer from their wide selection of beers and other beverages they offer! They also have a killer sushi menu that's very well crafted and is delicious!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! I had a tasty tasty Delux hamburger!! And their sweet potato chips are just perfect combination. Decoration is original and you don't even feel like eating fast food. Service was GREAT! My hamburger was forgotten (we were in a large group), but when the bill came, it included a 10% discount on the house for the delay! Worth to try!"}
{"text":"I'm really sad to write this review.  Both my fiancé and I love Delux, but after our last dining experience there, I don't think we will return. We stopped in late on a Sunday afternoon for lunch- around 3:30PM.  We were both starving, borderline hangry starving, and a burger and fries from Delux sounded delicious!  We took a seat at the bar and were greeted promptly, although the bartender seemed slightly annoyed to have guests.  We placed our drink and food orders quickly, and sipped on our drinks while we waited. I am sure most people know, and understand, the feeling of being STARVING.  Any movement at the food window prompts a glance- and a prayer- for your food.  We watched ours get put in the window about 10 minutes after our order was placed.  We also watched 3 servers and the manager look at the ticket and our food, and then walk away.  We were tempted to grab the food ourselves, but as a former server, I cringed at the thought of doing so.  By the way, the bartender was nowhere to be seen, and hadn't been present since he delivered our drinks. After about 3-4 minutes later, the manager finally picked up and delivered our food.  This may have been prompted by my fiancé loudly commenting on how hungry he was, since she (manager) and a female server were standing inches away just chatting about life and enjoying a lovely Sunday afternoon.  I am not saying my fiancé was right (I shushed him), but it got the job done.  Food was delivered and of course the fries were cold.  Burger was nothing special- I would have had a better burger at In-N-Out for 1/3 the price.  Overall, food was gross and not worth the price.  I left over half of my burger, which in itself is an accomplishment.  I love a good burger!  And on another note, which had nothing to do with the food, there were two other things that occurred during our visit that left such a bad taste in our mouths.  First, there was an unpleasant odor that permeated the restaurant.  I personally thought it smelled slightly of dirty cat litter, fiancé said he didn't notice.  Second, the friendliness and professionalism of the staff left a lot to be desired.  Our bartender- a male- was unfriendly and present maybe 10% of the meal.  Maybe.  The female manager was in hippie fringe booties with a long sleeveless dress and her waist length hair untied.  I was a server in Arizona for over 10 years, and I still work in the food service industry.  From what I can recall, both are health code violations in a restaurant, and they just added a negative element to the experience.  While she has lovely hair, when they are waving around my food nilly willy, it is gross.  Additionally, the other 3 female staff members on shift seemed more concerned about gossiping and wandering around than actually caring for guests.  Having shitty food isn't always a deal breaker, but professionalism and environment can truly make- or break- a meal.  Perhaps of the staff had been more attentive to our meal, our burgers and fries wouldn't have been cold.  Perhaps if the bartender had reappeared from wherever he was hiding, we would have had the chance to tell him how bad our food was, rather than leave this review.  Perhaps if the manager was less interested in gossiping with her staff than ensuring her guests had a quality meal- and experience- we would remain loyal guests of Delux."}
{"text":"Same deal as zenburger good hamburger but you have to have a deep wallet. Prefer full course meal for that price. Sorry. In and sorry fries are fries nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"The yam fries were fine and the beer selection was good.  My salad was ok but nothing memorable, pretty average actually.  Delux Burger was highly recommended by a friend and I expected better.  My server was attentive and friendly but in retrospect that might not have been completely sincere.  Hey... either bring us our change automatically or ask \"do you need change?\" when taking our money.  Those are the only acceptable options.  It's a little too presumptuous to assume I meant it all for you."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their burgers!! They also have this amazing bucket of mixed fries with spicy aioli!"}
{"text":"Came here when we visited family from Arizona! They decided to take us here bc it was good. It was a far drive though.. Everything seems to be so far away from each other compared to California. Anyways onto the food:   Chocolate milkshake- my bf ordered this and it was so thick and creamy! It was absolutely delicious and is a total must!  Deluxe burger- I switched out the bleu cheese for Swiss. The baguette bread was so soft and just the way I like it. The meat was so juicy and tender (I had it in medium rare).  Regular and sweet potato fries- it came out in little carts and was so cute! I like the regular fries more tho Vegas roll- my little cousin ordered this and we should've known better than to order sushi at a burger joint.... It wasn't good and got very old easily. She didn't even finish it.  California hand roll- she enjoyed this, but how can anyone mess up such a simple entree.  Classic burger- bf loved it and seemed happy with his choice   Decor Very trendy place! I'm not use to a burger joint being so hipster. Looked more like a bar for me. It was pretty cool though!  It was a bit on the expensive side for burgers. I don't usually eat burgers so maybe that's why? For 3 people, it was $66-76 excluding tip."}
{"text":"Great place!  I wish we had something like Delux in my neighborhood back in LA.    Burger is as good as the one at Father's Office in Santa Monica, without the hassle and the attitude.  I love that they have a take out annex where you can get anything on the regular menu to go!  Definitely one of the jewels in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Tried these guys last Sunday for lunch and was quite impressed. Sat on the patio (in the shade) and my friend and I were immediately served.  Had the regular cheeseburger - RARE and sure enough, it came back pretty bloody. They listened to me. I wanted to hug our server. Their buns tasted homemade and taste was on-point (not too bread-y)...  Fries came in my very own tiny shopping cart - very whimsical. And, tasty.  These guys are the bomb - I'll be back."}
{"text":"Amazing sweet potato fries with the perfect aioli!  Their burgers are good, just difficult to eat as the bun is very delicate.  Love coming here after hiking Camelback for beer and fries!  They have a great beer selection!"}
{"text":"I gave this rating base solely on my customer service experience, the food here is very good....The last time I walked into Delux 2 Go to pick up my turkey burgers was so awkward I wanted to walk right back out.  Now that the 2go side of the restaurant is also seating there are more servers walking around and going behind the take out counter. On a semi-busy Friday evening I walked inside and over to the counter but no one was there... not a big deal, I'll wait. Most tables was occupied with diners so I was just sort of hanging out with nowhere to sit, smelling the food and craving mine. Two different servers walked though the doorway from the main restaurant into the 2go area -zooming right passed me to their tables without even looking in my direction.. and then back out again. I thought I could at least get a smile, a 'how are you?', a \"someone will be with you shortly\" Nothing! Then, a server walked behind the counter where I was waiting and started ringing up something on a register. He was looking down or passed me the entire time, avoided eye contact completely. It was so uncomfortable!!! I am literally standing a foot away from his face and he says nothing and will not look at me... I was so close to greeting HIM and asking why he was avoiding me but I held back. It was super strange and I really wish I would have said something instead of just writing about it.. but hey. By the way when the young man who was working the take out counter finally came over he was nice and helpful... But seriously Delux.. Say Hello to people! I understand you are not making any money off me by saying hi or looking in my direction but a little customer service is always appreciated.  I am truly posting this review with the hope that this situation will not happen to any other customers. I am not trying to rant or complain that I was invisible to at least 3 employees as I waited for about 5 minuets.... maybe a little..."}
{"text":"The best BEST best BEST sweet potato fries. Good consistency with awesome seasoning! Sweet potato fries never really crisp up the way regular fries do, but there is so much flavor to these that you hardly notice they're a little limp! And served in mini silver shopping carts, which is surprisingly more cool than trying-too-hard. Burger patty is seasoned really well and is HUGE. Be careful when you order it medium-rare... it might come out a little more rare than you're expecting (soggy in the middle... but still oh so good)."}
{"text":"First time customer this past weekend! Our server was Connor and he was great! Helpful with suggestions, polices, and on top of refills.   The food was great, the best part is the lack of grease. The fries were light and crispy. I got the chicken panini which was flavorful and healthy. The chicken by itself was lacking in flavor, but combined with the other components, was well balanced."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The service is good, the food is great, the burgers are all Niman Ranch beef.  They also have resurrected Zen 32 in the adjoining shop.  Fantastic beer and wine selection and happy hour.  Love it!"}
{"text":"- Opened late, check!  - Friendly and accommodating waiters, check! - Communal table, individual tables, bar, or patio seating, check!  - Cool blue lighting on tables in bathroom, everywhere, check!  - Tons of beer on tap, check!  - Cute little shopping carts that hold french fries, check!   I love this place! It made me feel like I'm in a lounge with the lighting and decor. My turkey burger was great. I couldn't really see it clearly with dim lighting and blue light emanating from the table tops, but that didn't really matter, because it was flavorful and cooked to perfection. My absolute fav were the french fries that came with different dipping sauces and sweet potato fries. I can't get over the fact that it was just so darn cute that fries came in mini shopping carts, too adorable...I really wanted to take it home. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love their burgers!  I usually get the classic burger with avocado.  Great service every time we go! We like eating outside and they always turn the heaters on.  Plus their sweet potato fries are the Amazing! My husband loves the regular fries in the shopping cart."}
{"text":"Yet again Delux has not let us down.  Great food and even better service!  Thank you Matt Priess for the sympathy over the closing of Mexx32.  The sweet corn and recipe you gave us for the creamy rice will get us though the loss!  Thank you again for being a great local place to enjoy."}
{"text":"Creative dining concept...sushi, sashimi and real wasabi were all spectacular! The tuna rolls on the daily special were a great deal. Loved the real wasabi!"}
{"text":"This has now become our favorite burger place!  They are so confident of their Niman Ranch beef that they recommend medium rare burgers!  That's what I'm talking about! Juicy, flavorful and cooked perfectly. We shared a Delux burger on this visit (we couldn't finish them last time, and it's a 59-mike trip home for us!).  Our sever split everything for us - the burger, the shake and 2spoons for our soup.   They have a featured soup of the day. On Thursday, it's mushroom Brie.  You've got to try it. Creamy and just the right amount of mushrooms.   Love the sauces they serve for your fries. Tip - get the mixed fries. So good!   We will be back - there are many items on the menu we want to try. And Sushi after 4:00!!!!"}
{"text":"Delux has a neat vibe and the food is packed with flavor. The food/drinks might be considered a little more pricey than most places, but it's definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Well I'll start off with saying I like that they are open late. The service is good  even at the late hour. Had I not quit drinking I would have loved their huge beer menu. The atmosphere is nice and modern, the window to the kitchen and open kitchen is a nice touch, the shiny squeaky clean  kitchen makes you feel warm and fuzzy about your food.   Again the hype. Like many places I have tried the hype kills it. I expected this burger to a burger fit for the gods. One that is so great that one has to fast for days to able to mentally and spiritually prepare for the extraordinary flavor.  It was a good a burger, just not the best. It is what one would imagine for a gourmet burger. Fancy bread, fancy greens and fancy stuff on the plate that no one eats. The sweet potatoes fries are good but nothing special about them, I mean they sprinkle some chopped parsley on it.   All in all it is a nice place, the food fits the atmosphere and area. Just not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Delux burger medium rare (how they recommend it)...mmmmm!!! Such a good burger and get mixed fries so you can try their sweet potato ones as well. They come with great dipping sauces and in a little shopping cart which is cute and funny. I like the atmosphere inside, and they have a little patio too if it's not too hot. It's also open really late. I've never gone late....but I like knowing I have the option."}
{"text":"On recommendation of my friend who must have gone to Delux a long time ago, the signature burger was served maybe warm at best, with literally cold fries & McDonald's style shredded lettuce.  The burger was undercooked (which was explained to us after we complained about the food temp of all of our meals).  Suggestion to management; instruct wait staff (who in our case was new & not very knowledgeable about menu/bar options, but I don't blame her, except other wait staff not much more knowledgeable) to advise customer of lower cooking rating before customer orders (& before you serve people undercooked beef bacteria!).  Really, if this place was good to great (not sure if back in the late 90's?), then clearly it has been managed into a really second rate burger joint not worth passing a fast food burger restaurant.  Another suggestion to management, maybe take a day & go have a beer and a burger at your competitors like for example Yard House where that many beer handles is worthy a menu that describes your beer ABV & IBU Characteristics with actual bartenders who know their pours!   Until you do figure this out, trust me, your competitors will love your repeat customers!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to spot when I wanted a good burger. I was there a few weeks ago and it was as I remembered. Today the food was unrecognizable. Stale fries, dried burger, just totally off. So disappointed. The service was great though!"}
{"text":"Hype is way too big. Not a \"great\" burger and not a \"great\" environment. Plus, whatever you do, don't order desert. My wife and I ordered a key lime pie for $6, which is fine, but it was smaller than an iPhone. Such a joke."}
{"text":"So, after hearing about Delux from co-workers and Yelp, I had to try it.  Getting there early helps, because the restaurant gets packed quickly.   First off, the place is ultra chic. A large bar/table is in the center of the restaurant, highlighted with blue lights. This place oozes of sleek.  But enough about the lighting, onto the food!  I got the Delux burger, which was incredible. Medium rare beef, served up on arugula with gruyere and a mixture of onions and bacon was incredible. The bun, a super soft baguette style was incredible as well.   Juice dripped from this burger. Not grease, but juice.  Pure, delicious, incredible, beef juice. If I could bottle and sell it, I would.  My fiance had the turkey burger, which was excellently spiced, a tad dry, but the aioli helped cover that dryness.  Their fries were also tasty, I enjoyed the ketchup and aioli. However, I have had better sweet potato fries.  Their beer selection is awesome, including selections from 4 Peaks, I had an excellent Kolsch-style lager, that complemented my burger well.  The prices are a little high, but the burger does make it worth it, both size and quality  On a final note,I wouldn't recommend coming here at night, it seems like over priced drinks, loud music, and lots of stuck up people."}
{"text":"Rat infested kitchen Lenny doesn't care to fix it. Overpriced hamburgers and crooked owner. I came in a saw a rat running across the floor after trying Delux for the first time after getting a coupon from Mexx 32 which is now closed needless to say I wont be back. The staff is extremely friendly."}
{"text":"I've eaten in and done take-out from here, always a burger and fries. The burgers are fantastic and both the regular and sweet potato fries are delicious. Order a basket (or 1/2 basket) of mixed if you can't decide. The low rating is the result of two poor customer service experiences, both at the take-out counter.   Take-out is on the sushi side where you can call in or order at the register. While looking at the menu and asking questions about bun/cheese options, the gal at the register's attention was divided between me and a fellow co-worker (it may have been the owner). While she answered my questions, she wasn't particularly pleasant and I left feeling as though asking questions about their menu was bothersome to her.  To the staff:  Take care of one person at a time and don't rush your patrons. If you must be interrupted, be apologetic so your customers know their time and patronage is appreciated and respected. If you can't give customers this attention they deserve, add more personnel. Your food is great, but the customer service could use improvement."}
{"text":"Came here a handful of times recently. I sat at the bar and always have a fun bartender and friendly bartender helping me.  The beer choices for Amber's/Red's are not that great. The ones they do have range from Terrible to Middle level. (In my beer book). They give you a ton of fries with your order.  There isn't much option when it comes to the burgers, which is sad. I'd expect more from them."}
{"text":"The to-go section has now been transformed into a sushi bar/to-go area. Still the same space, but now they have a counter to sit at and watch the chefs roll the sushi. I called ahead and placed my order, they said it would be ready in 20 minutes. I got there in less time and paid. It didn't take much longer for my food to be ready, definitely quicker than the 20 minutes as previously stated. They separated the fries from the hamburger, so they kept crispy - which is good because I don't' like limp fries. The Delux burger, the namesake, was delicious as always. I love Delux and it's great you can get the same items from the restaurant quick and easy. If you are in a hurry, ordering ahead is a lifesaver."}
{"text":"The place is a bit dark inside. The burgers are fresh. Their sweet potato fries are fun and tasty, not overly greasy. I never leave feeling horribly full after my meal. Decent place to go once in a while."}
{"text":"We stopped by Delux on a late Saturday night after putting it off for several months. Having dined at the nearby Mexx32, we expected a pretty average experience. Delux has been around for awhile now, which means that they were one of the earlier adopters to the whole \"upscale\" burger trend that has since over-saturated the city. That's probably why most of the awards that they report were given out around a decade ago when places like this were still relatively uncommon.  The burger dining area was actually full, so we were seated on the sushi side of the restaurant. People describe it as trendy, but I consider it more to be along the lines of mid-00s Scottsdale as opposed to present day. The bar plays this video on a continuous loop that simulates bubbly water, with the occasional appearance of a badly animated shark. That's one of the problems with going with a trendy atmosphere. While it may have seemed cool at the time, it now looks pretty generic.  We started with a toasted demi-baugette, which includes olive oil and balsamic reduction. It was okay, but not much different than something that could be emulated at home.  I ordered a Delux burger, replacing the bleu cheese with American, due to my renowned hatred for anything within the bleu cheese family. My girlfriend ordered a classic, both cooked medium well, despite their medium rare recommendations which just seem a bit nasty when it comes to ground beef. Honestly, both burgers were just okay. My girlfriend felt hers was desperately in need of some type of condiment, while mine had a bit more life thanks to the inclusion of caramelized onions. Both burgers had decent quality beef, but I wouldn't quit put their burgers on the same level as say Ingo or Hopdoddy in terms of quality or creativity.    We disregarded their usual list of desserts and instead opted for the chocolate cake made with Mexican cocoa. It was actually very good and highly recommended, in contrast to the shakes or desserts that use Häagen-Dazs, a concept that was probably much cooler before Smashburger adopted it.  Honestly, there's nothing about Delux that's bad, but there's not really anything about it that I found incredibly great either. It's just a pretty generic upscale burger experience that was probably considered significantly more \"special\" a decade ago in comparison to now.   I'll give it an average three. But rest assured, if you do your research, there are far better options available if you're seeking a great burger."}
{"text":"I was on the fence at first but the burgers were simply outstanding.  The sweet potato fries were excellent.  I wanted to try the 7 dollar cupcake but we were having a birthday event.  Next time I am getting it!  The staff was friendly, made a spot for 8 of us and even helped us sing happy birthday."}
{"text":"A la carte fries in a SHOPPING CART = love. Sweet potato fries in a shopping cart = I have to check that I still have a pulse.  I wish wish WISH that there was a Delux in Chicago. The burger (rare, just how I like it) was nothing short of incredible, and I am ridiculously enamored of the mayo aioli for dipping the shopping cart sweet potato fries.   The beer/cocktail menu here is more extensive than you'd ever expect for a burger joint. It takes up several pages of the menu - which, by the way, is pretty nifty looking. The beer flights come in cute little trays, which may be entirely unnecessary, but they're fabulous nonetheless.  If I hadn't been so full from the burger, I would have had one of the gorgeous cupcakes from Delux's to-go place next door. Or a mini-apple pie. Or both."}
{"text":"\"If the melting pot exists, the cheeseburger may well be its most palpable product; to take a bite of it is to take a bite of history...\"  -Elizabeth Rozin, Primal Cheeseburger  Who could argue with that statement? Checked out Delux Burger today; Delux is a burger joint that gets some serious buzz and numerous Best Burger awards from the local media. They are also a late night favorite since they serve food until 2 AM. This gives them street credit in my opinion.  The mystery dining companion, otherwise known as L. joined me for this burger excursion this evening; we arrived around 10:00 PM for a late supper. The seating is a bit cramped in the dining room and the patio. The Delux menu is very nicely limited, meeting my personal rule for just do what you do best. We both ordered the signature entree, the \"Delux Burger\"($9.5), starring a half-pound of freshly ground Harris Ranch beef; supporting cast includes a toasted demi baguette topped with Maytag and Gruyère cheeses, sweet caramelized onions, applewood smoked bacon and organic arugula. We also ordered the Combination Fries \"a la cart\" ($6) which came out before the Burgers. The fries were fantastic! They were served in a mini shopping cart (making them easy to share) and included french and sweet potato fries. Two sauces were also included with the fries, a standard ketchup and a house aioli which resembled a thousand island type sauce with some kick.   The burgers came out shortly after the fries. They were impressive looking before we took the first bite - robust in size and the beef was perfectly cooked. Delux recommends to order their burgers at medium rare allowing them to showcase the juiciness of the beef; L. and I ordered our burgers medium and they were prepared perfectly. As we bit into these works of art, the beefy goodness oozed wonderful flavor onto our palate. The beef truly is the star of this show, however supporting cast complements it nicely without taking away from the magnificent flavor of the beef. This burger really hit the spot.  I was able to command and conquer this burger, however L. was only able to master one half and took the other half home. Adam from Man Vs. Food would have been so disappointed with her. A few other good factors that Delux offers: Good service, fantastic beer selection, which are primarily microbrews from across the country, and reasonable prices. If Delux has a weakness, it's an atmosphere that's a bit trendy and possibly even slightly pretentious, but the burgers are so good that it's overruled.  Overall, a fantastic experience... and another bite into burger history."}
{"text":"I recently moved away from Phoenix and can easily say Delux is 1 of the top 5 things I miss about that city. We ordered from Delux 2 go at least 3 or 4 times a month. The service was always consistent and we rarely ran into issues with our order. You can get just about anything off of the regular Delux menu to go. I do agree with others that the sweet potato fries can be soggy. We usually avoided soggy fries by telling our order taker that we had issues with soggy fries in the past and wanted to prevent that from happening again. The Delux burger is THE best twist on the conventional burger I have ever experienced and is best when prepared medium rare.   The sweet potato fries are a must with any meal and you always have to ask for extra secret Delux sauce. That stuff is good on ANYTHING!"}
{"text":"Best burger in town hands down! I've been here multiple times and it never disappoints. Burger is always cooked perfectly , can get seating fairly quickly and fries are great and come in cute little mini shopping carts! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Dinner at 10PM is a bit late for me but it happens when you have 7 girls flying in from different places to meet up for a bachelorette party.  ^_^  We drove over to the restaurant in our rented minivan.  We were starving.  As we walked in, all eyes were on us.  I want to say it's because we were 7 hot chicks, but honestly, I think it was because were 7 hot ASIAN chicks.  I think they were all impressed by how well we spoke English.  Ha ha.  Good times!  We had a little wait before being seated but it wasn't bad at all.  There just isn't an area to stand around because the joint is cozy.  But the decor is beautifully chic and totally fun.  We sat in the middle aisle which is set at bar level.  The stools (hence no place to hang your bag) are pinned to the ground so you can't group together with your friends but it's kinda good that way.  You're forced to step out of your comfort zone and sit a little closer to the guy next to you whom you never would have been so close to before.  I almost wanted to eat the fries off his plate.  Ha ha.    Speaking of fries, they were delish!  And the dipping sauces... one was ketchup but the other one... a most wonderful spicy mayo type creamy thing.  I had to save some to lather on my burger as well.  I had the Delux Burger, of course.  This wonderfully fantastic fat raw (but in a good way) burger was SO good, despite being full I finished the whole thing with a break in between.  Our waiter, this adorably gay blonde and outgoing boy, asked me how I wanted it cooked then proceeded to tell me it had to be medium/medium rare.  I'm glad I trusted him.    I had never thought of having a glass of wine with a burger before but I must say, the Ravenswood \"Icon\" Syrah was excellent!  The wine itself was delicious but with the USDA Choice all-natural, grainfed, Certified 4 Diamond Angus Beef it was to die for.  ^_^  http://www.deluxburger.com/"}
{"text":"Second time here and it will be the last! We ordered sushi for my friend and a mahi sandwich for me, they were served at different times and we didn't eat together. The Mahi sandwich was over cooked and served with a salsa that was unrecognizable and inedible. No sides with a $17 sandwich, absurd! Not once were we asked how things were....I would have sent the mahi sandwich back, no one cares to even ask why I left it on my plate. Water glasses never filled and overall poor customer service, very tragic as I think they have potential. $112 for us to leave hungry and had dinner at separate times! 2 thumbs down!"}
{"text":"I was on a burger kick and the word on the street was this place was it... Sat down at the bar and was blown back by the beer on draft it was stellar... Was greeted by Kristina with a smile and asked what we wanted to drink I had to have a sleepy Dog - Red Rover ... And some more chatting with Kristina helped me pick a beer flight I looked over the menu... I went with the Delux Burger (Blend of premium all natural ground beef topped with maytag and gruyere cheese, organic arugula and caramelized onion and apple wood bacon mixture all on top a toasted bemi-bagueette.  Plus an order of Half combination (sweet and French fries) The burger was really good and the fries as well it was funny the fries come in a little shopping cart made me laugh... This place is a really cool hip place really friendly staff and great craft beer selection will be back for sure."}
{"text":"De. Lish. Us.   Delux was one of the first restaurants I went to upon moving to Phoenix and I have gone back a few times since, mainly at lunch during the work week. It's my favorite burger spot.   The atmosphere is slightly on the pretentious side. However, it's very small and pretty cramped. Even at lunch during the week it can feel cramped at a table and there's a big chance of waiting in line awhile. I've sat both inside and outside and felt a little too close to the other tables. It's a little complicated with bigger groups also.  The food however is amazing. I always get the same thing, a delux burger and sweet potato fries. I don't care if you are scared of medium rare, you need to try this thing. It's one of the most amazing burger's I've had and I can never finish the entire thing. I'd love to have a mini one. That would be perfect. A regular order of fries comes in an adorable metal mini shopping cart. Also good to note is that by default you do not get just ketchup with your fries. Being a non tomato eater, it's nice to not have to remember to ask for another dipping sauce.   Oh the beer list you ask? Phenomenal. Being able to order a red velvet always makes me happy. Unique beer flights make me happy also.   I never have room for dessert while I'm there but I did have a friend order the cookies they brag about one time. It was rather hard and I wasn't impressed. That cookie should have been soft and chewy and full of deliciousness.  It's a bit on the pricey side, and you typically are going to have to wait awhile and/or be cramped, but if you're not in a hurry, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Blah.  I spent a while trying to figure out a good reason to go here.  I mean, the food's unspectacular.   The ambiance is kinda played-out.   The portions are smallish.  There really isn't much selection.  It's very expensive for what it is.  But... they do have a really cool fluorescent alphabet sign on the wall.     It's what suckered us inside in the first place.... and ended up being the most memorable thing about our meal.    It's really quite wonderful.  All of the letters are there.   You can combine them to spell any word.  While this neon-induced do-it-yourself wheel-of-fortune fantasyland can take you so far, in the end you're left hungry and unsatisfied.  BL_H.      I'd like to buy a vowel, please."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised that, during Happy Hour, my date and I were able to order a California Roll, Las Vegas Roll, seaweed salad, and a beer for $20. It was a good meal at a good price! I can't speak for their sushi prowess, considering we ordered pretty tame rolls. But the service was spot on and I left satisfied. Can't wait to come back and take on the American side of their menu!"}
{"text":"Went late Sunday night and ordered a plethora of food for my first visit.  The Las Vegas roll = highly recommended  The sweet potato fries = great The deluxe chicken salad = a MUST Very good food."}
{"text":"At first glance, Delux Burger stood out with its exterior decor (blue neon lights-It's blue inside too), outdoor patio (heated) and modern atmosphere (think Vegas).  It has an extensive menu (burgers & sushi!) and a wide variety of selection in wine, beer and other beverages.  The Delux Burger was well cooked to your specifications with quality beef from grass fed cows, but it is a bit blend by itself.  Fries/sweet potato fries are to die for and comes in a cute shopping cart/basket, but it is not included in the price with the burger.  I also ordered a house made root beer and it was well made.   The restaurant itself is quite small, but it is packed and everyone there seemed satisfied with their food.  Service was excellent as well, and the owner (or manager) came by a few times and seemed to be interested in whether people are ordering sushi (freshly shipped from LA?).  This restaurant is also one of the few places that opens until late.     It is definitely a high end burger joint complete with a sushi bar, a good place for a first date, but price was too high for me to fully enjoy a burger. 4+ stars."}
{"text":"Love the Delux Burger...Medium with extra aioli .  yum.  The panini's are fantastic and I love the grocery carts the sweet potato fries come in.  But the heavenly milkshakes are the best!  haagen daz.  Ooh hoo."}
{"text":"FOOD: Arguably the best burger I've ever had. The sauce they have on it is what makes it. The bread is also good. The sweet potato fries are a must have! Get a pint of beer to wash it down, they have a good selection.   PRICE: Expensive by burger standards. A burger is about $9, drinks are around $6, fries around $3.   SERVICE: The wait can be painful, I once waited over an hour with some friends for a table. The dining area is simply too small for how many people want to eat at Delux. Luckily, they gave us a discount on our meal for waiting so long.   ATMOSPHERE: Really odd blend of stylish bar and a burger joint. It's funny to see people dress all up for a burger.   SKINNY: Come here on weekends with a group of friends for an excellent burger and good drinks. You will be back again."}
{"text":"I'm not really a fan of burgers but boy, their Delux burger is a must try!! It is delicious! Their fries are also decent and I like how they serve it on a mini shopping cart(super cute!). Their special dessert is okay, I didn't really like it but it is good to try.   The place is very modern looking and my server was awesome. They also have a sushi bar which is kind of cool. I think the price of the sushi is kind of overboard but I didn't try it so I can't say much. However, the $13 burger is worth a try."}
{"text":"I have been going to Delux for years and years.. A great late-night spot (long hours into the morning!) with nice ambiance and yummy food.  Anyone who likes spicy mayo/chipotle aioli NEEDS to try the sauce they serve with the basket of fries (which, by the way, are in an adorable mini shopping cart). I think I could eat that sauce with every meal for the rest of my life (did I take that too far?). I usually do a basket of mixed fries - half sweet potato and half regular - and even dip my grilled cheese or burger in it!  I also got one of their giant cookies and the waitress offered to warm it up for me... Game-changing. So fresh and so good! Thanks Delux for being such a staple in my life for all these years! :)"}
{"text":"Great hot dog and chicken panini to-go!! Couldn't wait to write a review before I ate my chocolate-chocolate chip cookie."}
{"text":"Delux has one of the better burgers in town, and their fries are super tasty as well. The sushi is a great late-night treat."}
{"text":"This place seems to convince oneself that burgers are not only OK to eat but somehow cool, too.  The ability to eat here late is a plus.  Although the place is super lil, I have never waited very long for a seat....the burgers, beers, fries, and milkshakes are all 5 stars and the inside ambiance with the nifty lighting, furniture, plus shared restroom sink is also super hip.....BUT it's in a strip mall and strip it down, it is a burger joint.  A must for flamboyant burger and beer peeps.  I have been a number of times because of the late food service and will be back again for the fries and sauce."}
{"text":"Well, I finally made it here!  I went here with a group of coworkers for lunch the other day and I wasn't disappointed.  I ordered the Delux burger, but I'm not a fan of bleu cheese so they were able to substitute it for me.  The only bummer was it was a bleu cheese and gruyere mix and I would have loved to still have the gruyere.  So good, but a little messy!  We also had a basket each of the regular and sweet potato fries.  Yum!    It's busy during lunch time, so try and get there early if you have a bigger group.  The service was very good.  I really can't say anything which hasn't been said already.  I'll definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"When more than 400 Yelpers are telling you to give Delux a try, you should probably listen!  While there really isn't anything unique about this small modern burger bar, Delux comes up where it needs to; it offers up a delicious burger.  There are only two on the menu (the Delux burger and the classic standard burger), but my party of four ordered them in a different way, and no one complained.  I had the classic burger cooked medium with swiss cheese.  When it arrived at the table I cut the burger in half, and saw (then tasted) a perfectly medium cooked patty.  I didn't recognize any crazy seasoning or added flavor to the beef, which is a good thing.  I like knowing that I'm eating a premium beef that doesn't require anything more than a pinch of salt and pepper.  And the brioche bun; out of this world!  My table also ordered a basket of regular and sweet potato fries.  The fries come in cool little shopping cart baskets.  Go for the sweet potato fries and dip them in the special aioli, you won't regret it, the fries are crispy and the aioli has a wonderful sweetness that compliments them quite well.  And if you're looking for a quality drink to go with your food, Half of Delux's menu is alcohol.  There's a massive selection of micro brews and imports on tap.  How can you go wrong?  Not into burgers?  There's also a few cool looking sandwiches and salads.  Put off by the location being in a strip mall?  Welcome to Phoenix.  That's where the best local spots are."}
{"text":"As someone who has worked in a sushi restaurant, I'm a major sushi snob. I nitpick everything from the rice to the seaweed to the fish. I like Delux because the sushi is pretty decent and they're open late. I love love love their reverse happy hour! The service is pretty standard. Good ambiance, a little loud but still enjoyable. This is a great place to go alone and enjoy the late happy hour with a roll or two. They have an animated shark tank above the sushi bar which is fun to sit back and watch for a bit. I think the rolls are a little too thick to comfortably fit in your mouth in one bite (the rice ratio is a little off), but the roll varieties that I have tied have been really good. Definitely try the tiger roll is you are looking for something sweet and spicy!"}
{"text":"Best burger in the valley! They recommend getting your burger served medium rare, for me this is fine but many prefer their burgers to be cooked more. Simply delicious, and the french fries are addicting. I always get the mixed basket of fries, half regular, half sweet potato. They give u a plate of ketchup and their house aioli sauce for dipping. The tables are very close to each other and the place gets packed, so privacy isn't really something your going to get. They do have a patio so you can sit outside. I prefer sitting at the bar if you can get a seat. They have a lot of beers on tap, try a beer flight"}
{"text":"Happy Hour? It rules.   The food? It rocks.   Drink selection? Most excellent.   The best part? OPEN LATE!"}
{"text":"Any place that serves the full menu until 2 a.m. is awesome!  Aside from food till 2 a.m. (that's every night by the way), the food is fabulous.  So are the drinks.  I'll admit that I've only ever had the burgers, but damn they're good.  This place is on the pricey side...but who can put a price on a great burger?  Also, they have a to-go side too!  Make sure to try the red velvet cup cakes, if you still have room after the burger."}
{"text":"Delux is great - lots of good beers on tap.  also a bunch of vegetarian options - grilled cheese is great as is the caprese sandwich.  we usually sit at the bar which is good.  they have a great patio even though it overlooks a parking lot.  inside seating is not for me - it's like long picnic benches where if its crowded you are right next to strangers.   something i hate.  great atmosphere and a smallish tv which usually has sports on it."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and head to Delux!!!! You won't be disappointed. I had the pleasure of the Turkey Burger which was nothing short of fantastic! And the miniature grocery basket of half sweet potato and regular fries topped it all off perfectly. Can't wait to go back and sample the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, its very metro decorated.. very modern, which I like.    The food was good, I had a cheeseburger, the sweet potato fries are absolutely fabulous..   And the staff was really attentive and very nice.  I def recommend it."}
{"text":"I have heard of this place over and over for years, but since I really don't eat beef all that often, I had never visited... until yesterday. Let me just tell you, that friggin' Delux Burger is my new \"GO TO\" for premenstrual MEAT cravings!  Wow, it was a crazy delicious shot of iron my body needed. Honestly, I am salivating like Pavlov's dog just writing this review. Crap... now I'm starving.  Go. Get the burger. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"First time here and had heard good things but couldn't have been more disappointed. I was trying to choose between the chicken panini and the turkey burger. The waitress said I should definitely do with the turkey burger, it was by far the most disgusting turkey burger I have ever had in my life. It was chewy and just tasted awful. I would have sent it back but our waitress never returned to check on us after we got our food to ensure we liked or food or needed anything. She arrived back at the table after the group had finished eating I had over half my burger left and she didn't even notice. I will never return. I always order turkey burgers, a frozen jennie-o cooked at home tastes better then this crap served to me. The fries were nothing special and I know my friend who ordered the deluxe burger was not impressed either. Awful food and awful service, don't know why this place is popular."}
{"text":"Interior lighting has been brightened, thus losing the cool-hip and dim feel that I craved so much from DELUX. Liquor menu is WAY OUT dated, staff made no effort to compensate. Prices have gone up. Service is consistently INCONSISTENT. There's a TON of places where you can get an $8 cocktail and $10 burger.."}
{"text":"The place is cute and the staff is friendly. We sat out on their little patio and it was cozy.   I had the sliders and fries and boyfriend had the panini. His was awesome, mine was a bit bland but for once the patties on a slider were cooked properly to a medium rare. The fries were where it was at for me, they were delicious! Next time I will have to try their regular burger to see how it is really seasoned. I am also excited to try their sushi because that looked awesome on the menu."}
{"text":"We went here for desserts after going to our Burger Week's restaurant. We got warm chocolate chip cookies and donuts. Both were warm and delicious and I absolutely loved both. I have to say that I love the donuts a bit more though! This is definitely a must try dessert when you visit this restaurant! (I believe each dessert was $5.)"}
{"text":"Love the food. The fries are a meal in themselves!  We live on the other side of town but are still able to find time for Delux."}
{"text":"We went for dinner.  The staff is excellent.  Very attentive, prompt and super!  We split their burger and fries.  Delicious!  Also, love the decor and ambience.   But if you sit outside avoid sitting at a table where the waiting benches back up to the fence.  Something about having strangers heads sitting with their back right up against my table bugged me."}
{"text":"I used to think of Ossington as a street only to be trodden on if you were scouting locations for a murder scene or looking to buy illegal weapons from a guy named Buddy X.  But Ossington has become quite a hot spot in recent years with bars, restaurants, and galleries popping up rapidly on its southern blocks.  Among the hubbub is a very notable little place known as Delux, a French Bistro that is coolly stripped down to its naked elements - concrete walls et al.  The décor though definitely atmospheric leaves something to be desired, which is a good thing, because the food is most definitely desirable and fills in any gaps that the space itself may leave open.    Definitely check out the address before going to this place because it's one of those places that is way too cool to put up a sign.  God knows I walked by the place as many time as it takes to fight with your boyfriend 3 times before arriving."}
{"text":"I liked this place. Hip, young crowd. Burger patties are square and come with Caramelized onions and bits of bacon among other things (see pic of menu). The burger was juicy and good. Not sure what the point of the mix of shaved raw beets and raw carrots was other than garnish.   Extensive wine and beer selection on tap, with Sierra Nevada, Chimay, Green Flash, and Stella to name a few. This place also serves sushi: rolls and sashimi, although 7 slices of yellowtail for $17 is a bit on the pricey side.    This place has won numerous food critic awards for the Delux Burger, so it's pretty ligit as far as burgers go.   Point for improvement: not sure bun qualified for a \"Demi baguette,\" but that's how it's described in the menu. Was more like a French Bread loaf rather than a baguette in the traditional sense and it was a tiny tad on the doughy side.   All in all, I would come back here for the beer and burger.  I'm a tough grader. Service was prompt, nothing special."}
{"text":"I know, I know, \"How could you drop from 4 stars down to 2? Have you no Yelping character?\" you may ask.....well after several visits to Delux since my initial review, I am no longer a fan.   The burger is OK. They recommend you order it medium rare, and I decided that the reason they do this is to thoroughly soak the massive loaf of bread they call a bun in order to make it edible. The completely inocuous side of shredded beets and carrots is just confusing. And at 9.5 bucks, its just not doin it for me anymore.   This burger is just missing something, and all it really does is make me long for a delicious Father's Office burger.   Sorry Delux (and any fellow Yelpers whose sensibilities I've offended with my flip flopping) but I won't be headed back anytime soon...."}
{"text":"Okay, first, the service here is totally shitty. -5 stars, duh.  The burgers are yum. +3 stars  The beer selection? OMG BRB S&M BBQ LOL. AWESOME. +4 stars"}
{"text":"Thank God for this place. When all else is closed and you want a great meal (sushi or a burger) this is the spot to go. Service is great and so is the atmosphere... If you sit at the sushi bar during happy hour your first drink is free! The owner often visits your table to say hi... Smart move!"}
{"text":"If sushi is cut at midnight... Cut it at midnight. As someone who works in the industry, I know that you have to go by what your website says. Cutting items earlier than their scheduled times is bad for business. From my restaurant's perspective: you lost a customer because you decided to try and get out of work early. Which shows where your priorities are.   Sushi until 11:55 (or earlier maybe) for those of you who don't know. Not 12. Seems minor but pretty disconcerting when you make it to a restaurant before something is cut only to find out they did away with it earlier than they were supposed to. What are the hours posted for if you don't abide by them?"}
{"text":"Had their veggie burger w sweet potato fries. The fries were amazing and super cute cause they come in a mini shopping cart. The burger was alright it was too big to eat and the bun was dry not much flavor throughout. Kind of disappointed cuz I had heard a lot of things about this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. I love their fries, and I love their milkshakes the most. Of course the burgers are solid. They also do sushi and I still need to try that! The atmosphere at night is beautiful and low key. Great date night place for sure!  The best part is they're open until 2am! My friends and I were looking for some late night quality food and where else better than Delux :)"}
{"text":"If I was rating this purely on burger love I would def give four stars. Since I have to factor in service, Delux remains at a low 3. As with most things, at first it was great but it seems with every visit it gets worse. Last time, I actually called to complain. Too long a short story to get in to but just disappointing.  Now on to the burgers - juicy, cooked to perfection, flecked with blue cheese, spicy arugula, on a crisp bun! mmmmmmm Maybe next time I will just order take out?"}
{"text":"Great Beer selection.  Great Sweet Potatoe Fries, and well everything here is pretty damn good.  I usually stop by Delux after work and get a drink around 10pm. Its always a little busy but never hard to find a spot.  Delux is definanatly one of the places i  can go and just enjoy a good beer."}
{"text":"Stopped by for reverse happy hour. They had decent beer & sushi on HH specials. The sushi isn't amazing but for the price & for reverse happy hour - it was good!"}
{"text":"I come to delux all the time because it's really convenient for me and there's something about fries and sushi that really does it for me. The fries here are amazing and they have an aioli sauce that is AMAZING. Theyre served in a cute little shopping cart, too. They have tons of beers on draft which I really like, and most of their sushi is good too. They're happy hour is relatively unimpressive but does save you a bit (and they do reverse happy hour too). Service is always really good! I also recommend their mini burgers or lava cake. And Haagen daz shakes! Anyway, they're open til 2 and the food is good so I recommend."}
{"text":"This is the best burger place I've ever been to. There is no competition. There is only Delux. Accept Delux. Delux will be thy savior."}
{"text":"Forever one of my favs. Burgers, fries & sushi!! Plus it's open LATE! only thing that would be better is if they had more locations... Branch out!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for an excellent Asian Chicken Salad that is affordable, and tastes really good.  Check out Delux.  Get here around 11:30am and beat the lunch rush.  The place doesn't fill up until after noon.  Service is decent.  They have a nice patio area too so in the cooler times of the year it's a great place to sit.   One thing I will say is the smell when you walk in seems clinical.  I don't know what kind of cleaner they are using, but it smells like a hospital ward.  Maybe it's because we got there early, but still the smell lingers and its actually not very appetizing.    Overall, it's a great place to grab lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Delux burger are fabulous. The sweet potato fries are addicting and the beer puts it over the top. I often do not give five stars but this place has it all. Good service, Great Food, Outstanding Beer selection. You really can't go wrong. It is true it does get crowd but it is worth the wait and everyone know it. My recommendation is to go late night after the bar and have another drink with a great burger and fries."}
{"text":"I'm sorry, but hamburgers shouldn't cost $9.50.  The sweet potato fries are delicious, but I felt guilty pigging out on greasy foods with all the chrome and blacklight illuminating the hipper-than-thou disco-type dining area. I prefer dining in places that look like diners.  Anyway, I appreciate that Delux is open late. I appreciate the attention to ingredients. I just don't like the price and the late-90s \"modern\" look of the place. And the generic techno backbeats made me wish for a jukebox or my iPod."}
{"text":"Headline: Nothing Special  The headline pretty much sums up my visit. Neither the food, the service, nor the location were anything special.  I had the delux burger, which on paper should be a real winner. Unfortunately it turned out to be a big pile of *meh*.. Same with the fries.  The beer selection is decent with a few local brews that I haven't seen elsewhere.  I wouldn't mind giving it another try if I'm in the area again, but it seems like there are some better options pretty close by."}
{"text":"I was told that I *must* go here -- that the burgers are without peer. The website's touting of its countless \"best burger\" awards left no doubt. I was down.  The burger itself was just bland. I'm still curious why people think it's that great.  The fries, however, were amazing. A friend and I shared them, and it was more than enough. I'd order the fries alone.  Believe it or not, the best part of the meal was my root beer float (made with Haägen-Däzs). It was amazing -- the absolute highlight of my meal. The root beer is on draft, but I think it was the ice cream more than anything."}
{"text":"This joint definitely has highlights and low lights. Interestingly enough I'm not impressed with their buns on their burger or the beef patty they serve with the burger. I never enjoyed any of the bread they serve with sandwich it's not very good.  Mmm their sauce they serve with their fries is so so tasty it's tangy and creamy and lots of flavor. I wish I had the recipe.  I usually go for the salads their big and fresh organic lettuces. I've also had the lobster bisque which they have every day. That was pretty good.   I would have really liked to enjoy their sushi except I found their rolls to be overpriced. Shucks.   Oh, I really like their alcohol samplers good beer options here."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Always liked the burgers and fries.  And now that they have sushi it is also really good. never disappoints"}
{"text":"Fanciest most fun burger joint I have ever been to.  At midnight, the place was bumpin'  The burger was out of this world and was topped off with a great basket of fries served in a small shopping cart and complimented by a great mayo sauce and ketchup.  Washed it all down with some Fat Tire.   I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Deliciousness -3.5/5 Happiness - 5/5  Delux is a really trendy place, with dim lights, fun decor and plenty of neon. It is also the restaurant I have visited most consistently since moving out to Phoenix. Being open until 2:00 AM is another huge plus, especially if your priority is food. I have spent many a late night poker winnings on the reverse happy hour sushi there.  The food is really good. Though it's a burger restaurant, I would say the hamburger, though good, is the least tasty option on the menu. This is literally the only place where I order the turkey burger over the hamburger. The spice blended into the turkey is excellent, and they load plenty of avocados on top. The veggie sandwich is a crowdpleaser and the mozerella and tomato sandwich/salad is also delicious. They recently added sushi to the menu and it is passable, but not particularly memorable.   The fries are the true stars of the show. I would absolutely recommend the mixed regular and sweet potato fries. They hare served with tasty aioli and ketchup.  They are delivered in mini shopping carts, which is a nice touch (and always puts a smile on new diners' faces).   The beer selection is a bit disappointing and overpriced, and rather than the hagen dasz milkshakes, I'd recommend walking across the lot to the nearby Gelato Spot."}
{"text":"Delux sounded really good, so I decided to grab a burger for an early lunch.  I had heard from others that it was really good.   The service was excellent and for that alone, I give Delux 5 stars however..  I ordered a cup of coffee $2.50,  a half order of sweet potato and regular fries $3.5 and the delux burger with bacon and avocado $10.90 (typo in the menu it said $9.90) and $1.50 for the bacon and avocado. It was over $21, crazy!  The bill was high for what I got I think , compared to other restaurants, definitely not worth it.   Fries, awesome, in the top 5 for best sweet potato fries but not the best in town, sorry, I do have my favorites!  The burger was not a tasty as I imagined it to be.  Yes, it was fresh, but it wasn't that tasty even with the extra bacon and avocado, and usually I devour burgers if they are good regardless of the size, this one I didn't.   Delux has a wonderful outside venue and is a great place to hang with friends and maybe share a burger and fries, but I wasn't blown away as I thought I would be.  I gave the restaurant a 3 because of pricing and just the taste of the burger, it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"Great burger, very good beer selection, great service, nice atmosphere, open (& serving) late. My new go-to place when I want a bite & a beer - especially late."}
{"text":"1st: sweet potato fries with aioli 2nd: of course their burgers are great, but so is the chicken panini!!!!!!! 3rd: last but not least, great beer selection! Never had a problem here, other than getting a seat right away. I kinda wish their take out area was dine-in instead, but it's fine!"}
{"text":"Delux Burger is way over rated. And here I thought I was missing out on something. The only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because our service was good (Brandon). I ordered their signature Delux Burger. Uh no. As someone else's comment stated, there really was no taste, the roll was soggy with blood (I requested medium and then sent it back to cook more) and now that I think about it there was nothing more on my burger than lettuce. The sweet potato fries: ok. Hard to mess them up.  \"Good classic burger\"? Not at all."}
{"text":"Great burger, salad and service.   Would ask for extra blue cheese on the Delux Burger next time.   The Chinese chicken salad is huge and very good.  Great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Came here for a late night snack. They serve food late-- maybe 12 or 1 but not sure. They pour strong drinks, too. Be sure to try the fries, they come in a little grocery cart!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty neat! I loved the décor. We came here one night for sushi and it was pretty good. Not amazing but good enough. Service was friendly and the environment was fun and clean. I'd like to try their burgers, since they seem so popular. And their fries come in these little cute shopping carts! Lol I'd definitely go back for another try."}
{"text":"The other day I was hungry for a burger and had never been to Delux so thought I would give it a shot.  So let's start with the good, the fries were great.  They tasted good and love the little shopping cart.  Our waiter was really nice and friendly.  That is about all I was really impressed with.  My first impression on walking in was \"it is very loud in here\". Then looking at the seating I was thinking it should be fun sitting elbow to elbow with everyone in here.  Seats are very close together.  Not much room to enjoy your dinner and have a conversation.  Now the food.  I guess I just was not impressed by the food.  I had the Delux burger and it wasn't bad but not worth the price.  The beef may be good quality but it was not the best burger I have ever had.  I would probably not even put it up on the top 50% of burgers I have had.  I feel like if you say you have amazing burgers, then you should at least live up to the expectation.  My opinion is the burger fell short.  Other things that were not up to par was that the AC was not working very well.  I will say the owner came around and appologized for that and I think that was nice of him.  A confusing part of the place is the whole sushi thing.  Are you a burger place or a sushi place?  From what I have heard neither are amazing so maybe focus on one and do it well.  Also while our waiter was very friendly I would not say the service was great by any standards.  Not sure if I will try it again... maybe a sandwich next time???"}
{"text":"Delux is a great, they have won a gazillion awardsfor a reason. Their burgers amazing and their partnership with Niman Ranch makes for all natural veggie fed meats. They are open until 2am which is great for a lot of people who work in the service industry.   I've never tried the sushi as I always come for burgers but I heard it is pretty outstanding also. My favorite part about the food is they serve the fries in these cute little grocery  carts. It may be silly but I think it's pretty cool."}
{"text":"First visit was a couple weeks ago after a concert and had to say one of the best burgers I've ever had. Came here again and it confirms my opinion of the best burger. Well balanced and the perfect combination of bread/meat/toppings. If you come here, order the delux burger the way it comes, it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"I knew I shouldn't get sushi in the desert but I was really craving it and my friend told me there was good sushi in Scottsdale.  Well this isn't it.  I spent $40 on takeout sushi that would cost me $15 in (Washington) DC in a high end grocery. Maybe $25 in a restaurant.  Just to be clear - DC is not a cheap place, and sushi is not cheap food in DC.   Delux sushi tasted like grocery store sushi too.  Like crappy grocery store sushi. The crab meat was tasteless imitation crabmeat, the avocado was hard and unripe, the rice was stale, a lot of the fish was rubbery.. the spicy tuna was tasteless and not spicy.. etc. I could go on and on.  Finally the rolls were small. Sorry guys, but small rolls + crappy fish + stale rice + $$$$ is not a great formula for sushi.  I could understand either:  - big rolls + crappy food + $$$$  or - small rolls + decent food + $$$$  but not small rolls + crap + $$$$  (FWIW I ordered the rainbow roll and the tiger roll, as well as seaweed salad.)"}
{"text":"Delux is that hip place you get to overpay for a burger.  Who cares about overpaying when you're in the Arcadia area anyway?  The atmosphere is cool, burgers are great, beer selection is eclectic with many choices, wines by the glass are good, but bottle list could be a little nicer considering the clientelle.  Not that many nice wines pair well with sandwiches, I'd just like to see a little more creativity from the owner/management.  I've been here many times, and will be here many more."}
{"text":"Delux's fries, sweet potato fries and aioli (garlicy, olive oil sauce) are really what makes them special. Try them and get out. Bar has a great selection of beers.  Service was nice and the ambiance aspires towards a Deutsch discotech. We opted to sit outside because the neon blue lighting inside looked overbearing.   The Delux burger itself is much meatier than most burgers, and I think this is what impresses most people. Unfortunately, the meat and bread lack flavour. On return visits, I tried it a few more times, but there's something about the meat that sets me off. I usually walk away feeling not quite right and suspect the meat has been treated.  Nice place for people who don't care too much about the food but want an interesting ambiance; otherwise, it seems to stretch its image of itself beyond reality somewhat. I don't object too strongly to coming here, but on my own accord, would not choose to visit again."}
{"text":"This is a very delicious burger joint. They sell sushi as well which is just as good. The decor is wonderful and the service is great too! Great place for a burger!"}
{"text":"Awesome concept! Some of my friends don't like sushi but with delux you have something for everyone since they have sushi and burgers."}
{"text":"Delux is my go to place.  Always a great burger and my favorite beer selection on tap (besides Yard House, but I'm not into chains).  Can't go wrong with either the Delux burger or the Standard burger.  The rest of the menu is good, too.  The Chinese Chicken Salad is refreshing and can serve two.  Love the milkshakes.  Every once in the while the burger comes out undercooked, or the bread hard, so that's why I'm not giving it five stars.  I guess given the frequency I eat here, I'm not going to hit a home run every time.  Hope to see here you soon!  [Update 11/30/12] Realized that my prior review is way outdated.  At one time my favorite local beer and burger spot, but now, just a distant memory.  I've given Delux soooo many chances to change my mind.  Beer is now often flat, and my burger never comes out right the first time around.  I really hope they can fix the problems and bring back the Delux I was knew and loved."}
{"text":"Where's the Beef?   Evidently it's at Delux! A burger is all in the beef and Delux doesn't skimp! The Delux burger is melts in your mouth and get prepared for the flavor explosion from the sautéd onions different cheeses and a great bun! I had the gaschpacho as well which was fresh and tasted good but I was disappointed that they started with bloody mary mix as the base.   The Beer selection is amazing and they have great taste in micro-brews!  Atmosphere is hipster sheik but the clientele is biker to gym rat!!  If your close this is a must try!!"}
{"text":"Delux burger has always been a favorite of mine, you can never go wrong with their burgers or sushi, oh and can't forget the mixed fries with their aioli sauce!!! I've been coming here for quite sometime and I have not once had a bad experience here, except on ubereats, a few minor mistakes, but still hasn't stopped me from keeping this place one of my go to spots! Definitely a lover of Delux burger!"}
{"text":"The burgers at this place are AMAZING! They are big, cooked to perfection, and extremely tasty. The fries are delivered in a cute little shopping basket The service is friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant. This is definitely a place you want to visit. It also is open late night with a full bar; that's certainly a plus!"}
{"text":"After the beet salad I had here recently, it was time to update this review.  I LOVE the fact that no matter how late it is, Delux seems to always be open (at least for an old person like me).   I LOVE the fact that the restaurant caters to different appetites. Feel like sushi? No prob. Feel like a hamburger from grass fed beef locally grown. No prob. Feel fat? No prob, order a tasty salad. You won't go wrong!  I LOVE the fact that the location is so convenient to home, and the parking lot is big enough to find a place to park.  I had my first Lindeman Framboise here. So, refreshing! There are a lot of beer options on tap, so you'll likely find something you like.   The beet salad was excellent and I'd definitely order it again. Full size, no prob. Just keep me away from those addictive fries!"}
{"text":"I came in last night and mostly enjoyed my visit. I love the food here and the staff is as friendly and helpful as can be! Despite the cool ambience and delicious food, the managerial staff is below average and, in fact, makes me not want to come back. Being so that I work in the restaurant industry and have been for years, it's easy for me to distinguish between an effective management staff and one that isn't. I even watched them pull one of their employees aside last night and interrogate her about what seemed to be a complaint or bad review or something right in front of us! I have ordered togo before from this employee who has well exceeded my expectations in the past and am shocked. A few times before I have had encounters with the managers who have badgered me and truthfully, creeped me out and I am not about to spend my money here again when the managers seem to be as shady as they come. I will miss this place!"}
{"text":"Ever since they started selling sushi at this restaurant it really smells inside. My wife and I will get the food to go or eat on the patio because the fish smell is so bad inside the restaurant. Also, why does a side of fries cost $6 when it should be included with a $12 burger."}
{"text":"Why doesn't Delux offer a veggie burger? Come on Delux! I would give you 5 stars if you would!   Anyway, I'll settle for the beet salad which is huge, delicious and healthy.   The sweet potato fries are pretty good too, especially with the sauce they serve with it.   Service is always very friendly. Great location too!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  Went there for my husbands birthday - he loves burgers.  I ordered the Chinese chicken salad.  The salad was horrible - no vegetables except small pieces of lettuce and cabbage and shredded carrots.  They give you  packaged breadsticks that iare stale,   Chicken was extremely salty.   I ate about 1/8th of the salad and  couldn't eat more.  The waiter never asked why I didn't eat the salad.  We wound up picking up Chinese food on the way home."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying I'd have slapped Delux a third star if my burger wasn't so god damned over cooked.  I'm a meat-a-holic (that sounded naughty) and I know what I like.  Fa-reaking rare;  cook the \"moo\" out and we're good to go.   My sammy was chared on the outside, gray-ish pink on the inside.  Tell Mr. Krabs to fire spongebob and get a wage monkey that can handle temperature orders. (I'd so work here)  All that being said,  the restaurant was nice, though I was sat at the community table (what is with THIS fucking trend? I don't want to sit on a strangers lap...hmmm....) and even though my meat was nuked, it did have some good flavor.  I shall return to Delux in search  of redemtion.  For them.  Yeaaaah."}
{"text":"What's not to like about Delux?! I had a tasty turkey burger, which was nicely seasoned (you know turkey burgers can be on the dry side). We had the mixture of sweet potato fries and regular fries, which come with that yummy sauce. We sat at that long middle table, which is awesome with the lights (loved the under table hooks for purses..nice touch). Quick service, fun place-good food. Love the late hours-it's not easy to find late dining in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Technically, I have not eaten at Delux but will review them regardless. I have non celiac gluten intolerance and I HATE IT!!!! There are people who have jumped on the gluten free band wagon in the hopes of losing weight....I assure you, I am not one of those people. Combine that with the fact that I am vegetarian makes trying new restaurants challenging.  I checked the menu and could get a grilled panini wrapped in lettuce instead of bread but I cannot get the fries. I could get a salad but I don't know if the dressing is gluten free. A trendy restaurant that is located in the Biltmore does NOT offer gluten free bread and does NOT have a separate fryer to prevent cross contamination makes no sense. The menu doesn't even list if somethings are gluten free/vegetarian/vegan or can be modified for those diners that are gluten free/vegetarian/vegan. If this restaurant was located in a tiny midwest town that would make sense but you're in the Biltmore. My advice is to partner with a local gluten free bakery, get an additional fryer and update your menu.  I really hope you guys read your Yelp reviews."}
{"text":"I first came here several years ago before I was a yelper.  The delux burger haunted my dreams as the best burger I've maybe ever had.  Since then, I've had many high end burgers, so I was thinking, it's probably not as good as I remember and I've built it up in my mind.  Nope!  It's still awesome and totally lived up to the anticipation.    So what makes the Delux Burger so great, well it starts off with very high grade Niman Ranch Beef.  You want this burger to be nice and pink so order it medium rare.  It's such a juicy burger that the beef itself creates a sauce that is soaked into what they call a demi baguette.  This is a perfect bun.  It's shaped like a mini sub roll and the burger is also rectangular so you have burger covering every inch of the roll.  You would expect something called a baguette to be crunchy on the outside, but this isn't.  It's nice and soft, yet firm enough not to fall apart.  The cheese on this burger is an interesting mix of may tag bleu cheese and gruyere.  I felt on this visit, there could have been a little more cheese, so next time I'm ordering extra chese for sure.  The burger is also topped with a blend of caramelized onions and chopped up smoked applewood bacon.  The only veggie is baby arugula.  It is perhaps tossed in a little olive oil first, but I'm not sure.  You don't add on or take off from this burger, as it's perfection.  They brought some ketchup and mayo but it takes away from the flavor.  The juices from the beef along with the caramelized onion bacon mixture makes sure the burger is in no way dry.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delux-phoenix?select=9-u-8vM2cZKHwQYG00yZ4w#ORnSlQsuz19YA5juttyufQ  Now if you live in Los Angeles, this burger may be familiar to you.  It's called the Father's Office Burger.  And truthfully Delux Burger ripped it off.  But this is better hands down.  I've had a few father's office burgers in between my first and last Delux Burger and it's not even close.  They have perfected it here.  They even stole the A La Carte Fries idea served in a little mini shopping cart.  But let's just call it an homage, because the fries are way better at Delux too.  We got the mixed sweet potato and regular fries.  Perfectly seasoned, crispy, but still potatoey.  I'm not sure which I liked better, so I love that you can get a mix.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delux-phoenix?select=9-u-8vM2cZKHwQYG00yZ4w#hcCouQJXFqiYIFikfy_eZQ  Got to try a few other things as well such as the Brie and Mushroom Soup.  While it didn't have gooey strands of brie (man I was hoping for that) it was more like a very rich cream of mushroom soup.  Very good.  They have a different soup each day, so if you want this one you have to come on Thursdays.   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delux-phoenix?select=9-u-8vM2cZKHwQYG00yZ4w#JZaNWjKY7Q8YgAWmUy62TQ  I was so full it was hard to get dessert, but I'm so glad I did.  The apple pie was very homemade tasting, piping hot topped with Haagen Dazs Vanilla Ice Cream.  We loved every bite of it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delux-phoenix?select=9-u-8vM2cZKHwQYG00yZ4w#MpH-7ioUSrGWUCqgxLo3TA  I wish I lived near Delux as I'd love to try some other things on their menu.  They now have a Sushi bar as well, but I have no idea how it is.  The vibe of the place is great and they have the kind of bathroom you wished you had in your house.  The attention to detail at Delux doesn't go unnoticed and it was great to see that they are still at the top of their game.  Another plus is they are open until 2am with a full bar!!"}
{"text":"Always on Point!    Been there over 30 times and never had a bad experience.  I Get the Delux Burger, Medium cooked and a basket of sweet potato fries. May be the best burger in Arizona. Service is always great. I also recommend their Grilled cheese and Peanut Butter & Banana Milk Shake. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Delux is delicious! I go here pretty often and it has yet to disappoint me! You wouldn't expect to find amazing burgers and amazing sushi in the same place, but they manage to do it every time! The fries are great too and come in a cute little shopping cart :) I loveee the fact that they're open until 2AM because it helps when I'm out with friends and we are hungry but most places are closed.   The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food can sometimes take a while to come out, but hey for the food you're getting, I don't mind waiting a little while! :)  I will continue to recommend Delux to anyone in the area looking for good food!!"}
{"text":"Best place for girls night ever.  The food is delicious and the atmosphere is fun and hip. When it cools off, the patio is awesome to sit on. The servers are mostly friendly and attentive.   Pros- Great Food, Reasonably priced, Open late (2am! And serves food late too!) and Tons of beer on tap.   Cons- Can get crowded during peak hours, Not insanely kid friendly ( not unfriendly- but the restaurant is smallish and my child can be very friendly with whoever is sitting next to her) and sometimes the fries are too good and I want to order more.   We've been coming here for years. Definitely try the grilled chicken panini! You wont be sorry :-)  The to-go side is great as well. Definitely fast and efficient."}
{"text":"FYI, it's bad luck to have chopsticks sticking up in a bowl. Re: Chinese chicken salad  Anyways, the burgers are not what they once were, or my tastebuds have greatly evolved.  Mine was no good, no good at all, if i were not so hungry i would have sent it back. Yeah, that bad.  The fries were good though!"}
{"text":"This place has a really laid back atmosphere, ordered sushi and the classic hamburger. The hamburger is pretty simple just great meat, cheese and bun, they do give you lettuce, pickles and tomatoes on the side and I asked for mayo and the brought that too. Meat was cooked perfect, it needed a tiny bit of more salt other than that, it's a decent burger. The sushi tasted fresh and it's one of the best ones that we have tried in Phoenix. Service is great, and the order came really fast."}
{"text":"I came here after having wanted to try this place for some time.  I love hamburgers, and a good burger is a real treat for me.  Nothing complicated really, just a good well made burger.  When my date and I arrived, we liked the interior.  The place was smaller then I had anticipated.  Very narrow seating.  Anyways, service and menu selections were excellent.  I went with the traditional burger, and my date went with the Panini.  I went with the French fries, and date went with sweet potato.  I loved both.  The excitement of my night was the fries in the shopping cart!!  Anyways, I was happy with my experience here.  I would return, and liked my food.  So did date. Aside from tight seating, lovely place!"}
{"text":"This is such a great place! Have been several times and don't know why it's taken this long to write a review!  Open until 2 am everyday.... love that!!   Husband had a burger..... I had sushi! All under the same roof!! Genius!!  Service...... fabulous. Tonight we had Tara.... she Rocked!!  Must try this when you just don't know what you want!! It ticks so many boxes   Oh..... did I mention.... 40 beers on Tap! Come on!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while but I can't believe I forgot to review it.   This place is one of my favorite spots to get a burger. They're open till 2am everyday. Their burgers are so delicious and juicy. They also have my favorite beer Chimay, which not many restaurants carry.   The staff was nice the last time I went and before that but I don't know how they are now I'm sure they're great because the owner is a smart guy!   If you're willing to spend $12-15 on a good burger, then this is your spot!"}
{"text":"The burger is juicy and yummy. My friend and I ordered the same thing and we enjoyed the burger immensely. The patty simply melts in your mouth. Also ordered the mixed fries. The only complaint is the food was pretty rich and I felt kinda nauseous after devouring the burger and inhaling the fries. It's my problem though. Give it a shot!!"}
{"text":"I love Delux! It's open late 7 days a week, which is a huge plus in Phoenix! I've never had a bad burger, all have been delicious; including the turkey burger, it's is very juicy and flavorful! I can't forget to mention the Chinese chicken salad, large portion and yummy! The addition of zen 32 sushi is nice light option to have at a burger joint. Some of the sushi items are a little overpriced, but has always been fresh!   Basically, You can't go wrong when you stop here; night or day!"}
{"text":"I come her all the time and the service is hit or miss. Ask for autumn she is she beat and so cute!"}
{"text":"I have little else to say about Deluxe, other than it was there that I witnessed the unfortunate result of an unfortunate trend. Low-sodium \"soy\" sauce got itself added to the table at Japanese restaurants over a decade ago. Like a virus, its process of proliferation led to its overstepping its boundaries. Four years ago, I began having to ask the server to bring the real-er soy sauce to the table, as it became standard practice to bring that green-lidded, watered-down, bitter-tasting, sodium benzoate-laden gorp that people thought would act as the sole prophylactic against future kidney troubles, high blood pressure, and heart problems. My dinner at Deluxe exposed me to the culinary downfall of Western Civilization. The standard procedure, of the server bringing over that swill, happened like clockwork.  - \"Will you bring a bottle of regular soy sauce?\"  - \"We don't carry regular soy sauce. The low-sodium is the only kind we have.\"  To the server and among my friends, \"(chuckling) I never thought I'd see the day...\"  What to do...I had to think fast...  - \"What if I had a gluten allergy?...Do you have gluten free soy sauce?\"  - \"Yes we do.\"  BOOM! Checkmate, Sir. See, like the company informing you that Twizzlers, a product composed almost entirely of sugar, is fat free, I can order gluten free soy sauce and get as close to the real thing as possible. Companies like to save money by cutting their soy sauces with wheat, a practice they may have picked up by watching crafty drug dealers. Those with celiac disease cannot have wheat-derived products, so gluten free soy sauce is typically made purely from soy beans. Kikkoman still looked to money-saving strategies and cut their version with rice, but I was still happier than being forced to dip my maki roll with the fake crab in it into a fake soy sauce."}
{"text":"Excellent burger place! The music was interesting and the patio was beautiful. Little slow waiter and someone was smoking right by the patio.... Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"For variety in Phoenix, I give this a 5 star rating. It is quite good. The sweet potato fries are a must. The aioli they serve with it is great. The salads are not that great and their burgers are more impressive in their description than their actual taste. The milkshakes are rather icy, not creamy. However, it is still pretty good and its open late."}
{"text":"What to say? It's burgers and sushi in a club-like atmosphere. I tried the lobster bisque and a mini burger. Both were rich and made with high-quality ingredients. Would I have liked more lobster in my bisque? Am I not a man (woman)? So the answer is yes, but the only place that really loads up their bisque with a 1/4 of a lobster is Ray's the Steaks in Arlington, VA. Go to there. Back to Delux. I really did not like the decor/lighting and the seating is uncomfortable. I think a more homey atmosphere would go better with their food and give off a less gimicky vibe. But, what do I know? I am a mere simpleton from Tucson. Some in the party enjoyed their sushi, but I did not try. I thought the low-carb roll options were a neat idea. The beer selection was also better than average."}
{"text":"As I walked into Delux the other night I instantly felt guilty of cheating on my beloved burger joint, that shall remain nameless in this review.....   I have to say I was impressed. Lots of beers on tap, Mothership - really close to a Hoegarden was my fave! They also have what they call \"Flights\" where you get a board of three different beers shooter style to try. Next time if I am feeling feisty I will trying them out.   I ordered the Turkey Burger, very good. It has lots of flavor. And sadly I had to admit that their wheat bun is a bit better than the one I get at the burger place that shall remain nameless.   Over all the place is a go. Nice ambiance, a tv to watch the game, great plate presentation, good sized patio out front (patio is key in AZ!). One thing I will say negatively.... bar stools - not comfortable at all."}
{"text":"As a self proclaimed burger connoisseur I am always on the hunt for a quality burger spot that provides a tasty product without the need to overdo it with toppings and condiments. I am happy to say I have found another place that meets this criteria!   Delux is a small restaurant that doesn't look like much from the outside, but the food they cook up on the inside is bomb! I had the sushi years ago and it was good, but their bragging rights come from their ability to create a darn good burger that stands on its own. There are a few options for burgers including a turkey and veggie version, but I go with the classic and add crispy bacon. They cook them to perfection (medium rare is highly recommended), and when you bite into it the flavors and juice of the meat melts in your mouth. Lately it seems as if places are creating a bigger badder burger with everything besides the kitchen sink as a topping, and in my opinion it ruins the beauty of quality meat. Delux does not do this, they let you taste a good burger as it should be! They also have regular and sweet potato fries that are delicious and seasoned perfectly.   Tonight we ordered to pick up and the guy who took the order could not have been more friendly, competent, and on point with the order. When we got there to pick it up it was ready at our requested time and the order was flawless. Their prices aren't exactly cheap, but it seems to be the going rate these days.   The only thing I don't love about Delux is the atmosphere inside, it's just not my cup of tea. It is modern and tight, so I prefer to order to go.   This place is great, you've gotta try it!"}
{"text":"VIBE  Relaxed. Casual. We were here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Perfect for a lazy weekend. Lots of dusty blue booths and if you go right when it opens, it's quiet. By noon the tables were pretty much gone. It's the type of place where the clientele are stretching out their legs or reading a newspaper at the bar.   WE ATE  This was my first time for a pressed Cubano. Cured pork and ham were tender and sweet. It went well with the  grainy mustard, chipolte mayo, chopped cornichons (mini pickles) and red onion. Sweet and sour is a good way to satisfy my tastebuds. Instead of fries, we tried the rice and beans and the fried plantains. The rice is a hefty portion and had great flavour. The plantains were a wee bit on the salty side but also sweet and a great alternative to fries. Plus, I got a mini coke bottle. It added to the whole retro-modern vibe of the joint. I'm definitely coming back here.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  The only restaurant I know of in Toronto that has conch fritters on the menu. Refreshing to see food with a Cuban/French flair. I felt like I was on vacation. Brava!"}
{"text":"This place may be better known for their fries but they have a great burger. I like that they only have a few burger options. I suggest the original Delux burger. Get a mixed basket of potato and sweet potato fries.  Great beers on tap too!"}
{"text":"Listen if your on yelp trying to decided what to eat chose this place the burger ORDER it !!! It was amazing HOLY grail of burgers ..that is all"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 5 girlfriends and we had a great meal. We ordered one of almost everything on the menu and shared it all. Everything was AMAZING although I had a particular affinity toward the pork belly. The texture was spectacular and flavor... Well... I actually licked my plate, but just a little, we sat right in the window afterall. Hahha.   They should really review their staffing though, we were there on a Sunday of a long weekend, all of Ossington was bananas but these guys only staffed one server. Joe was totally slammed and couldn't keep up as everyone arrived in a big wave and we were all on the same schedule and the place was nearly full. We waited for 45 minutes with empty plates and wine glasses, and then another 15 after requesting our bill. There was also a long wait to order but the food came fast (meaning the kitchen was probably adequately staffed for the rush but not the front of house). Joe was great, super friendly and kept his cool the whole time but really needed some support. Poor guy was making drinks for everyone too! He was really really great, just a bad situation.  Ossington on the first long weekend of the year and only one FOH staff? Are you kidding me?! Lucky he was such a strong server or we probably would have walked out. That guy deserves a raise."}
{"text":"My boss has been picking all of the restaurants while we've been in Phoenix (and to his credit, they've all been pretty awesome) but today I was told to find us something for lunch. Fortunately, there's this nifty website called Yelp where I was able to find a place that had both burgers and sushi, thus hedging my bet.  Upon arrival, we were informed that sushi was only available at night, which kind of bummed Boss Man out - he was secretly hoping for some sort of sashimi burger creation, but it was not to be. He had to settle for the Delux Burger which was served on a brioche bun and topped with any number of things. Given the speed at which he dispatched it, I assume it was very good.  Because I am forever in search of a decent turkey burger I had to sample Delux's version. It was legit - a thick, juicy, well seasoned patty that was full of flavor and topped with fresh avocado slices. It was everything I hoped it would be.  Service was prompt and pleasant and the tab was reasonable. Four stars for the best turkey burger I've had in a long while."}
{"text":"Two words, CHICKEN PANINI!!!! Actually, I'd like to add the mixed basket of fries. The burger is great too but I always default to the panini. I have never had anything like it. Its fantastic. The atmosphere is pretty cool and the staff are friendly. Its open until 2am so its always a great place to go for late night eats. Definitely go here, you wont regret it."}
{"text":"You have to experience DELUX.  The food is a combination of sushi and hamburgers. I had a seaweed salad and a Classic Burger. The video makes you feel like you are watching a giant aquarium and then oops-a shark shows up just for the thrill of it. Wanted a 1/2 order of fries-no problem.  They customize everything on the menu for you, if you want, and make a point to offer \"protein style\".  Love the vibe and the atmosphere.  The food is delicious!"}
{"text":"So sorry dont go here     Three of us had different items for breakfast horrible  County fried steak raw in middle, Corn beef Hash  hardly any corn beef red whole potatoes not even cut up.  Toast no butter just dry toast.  Same owner has mexican restaurant couple doors down but asked for salsa was given Tobasco told they have no Salsa. No taste very Bland.  My Husband Loves cornbeef Hash I warned him about the bad reviews from others he said well restaurant must read the reviews and now have made it good.. WRONG"}
{"text":"Slightly overpriced and overhyped... still a decent burger. Reliable and tasty... just not exceptional. The fries are decent too, but nothing I'd rave about. It's a pretty cool place, but it's very busy and popular, so it's often difficult to find a good seat. I also don't much care for the way it's set up - you might have to rub elbows with a stranger - it's far from intimate dining... no matter where you sit, your conversation is open game for everyone nearby.   I'll eat here once in awhile, but I'm not their biggest fan and they haven't really won me over ever with their service. I don't know why it's so popular really... maybe it's cuz the menus are fancy looking."}
{"text":"I would move back to Phoenix just for this restaurant.  My roomate introduced me and although I've been there only once, that was all it took for me to fall in love with this unique Burger joint.   Its probably the best burger I'll ever have!  The fries (regular and sweet potato) come in cute little shopping carts!  Great beer selection and the menu isn't too extensive, but don't bother with anything else than the burger! Not too pricey, and the wait staff is friendly.  Unfortunately is so damn good, its always crowded and the seating area is just so friggin small!  You're kinda seated family style on this long table on bar chairs that don't move.  Wait can be looong sometimes, but trust me, its all worth it in the end when you take your first bite!!  Gosh, my mouth is watering!!!!"}
{"text":"Best burger I have had in Phoenix/ Scottsdale area yet. Two choices- having tried both the classic standard cooked medium rare gets my vote. Also the mixed fries with the aoili are amazing. Great job just a little crowded."}
{"text":"I have never tried a burger that was so delicious. I am absolutely blown away with not only the food but the quality of staff. They are very quick and have never messed up on anything I have ordered. The layout of the restraunt is nice and they keep the place clean.   Drinks are a little bit on the high side of the price scale, but the quality of food and service makes all the difference. I will be dining here again and hopefully in the near future!"}
{"text":"Amazing fries and burger. Can't wait to go back. Great ambiance. Large draft beer selection. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"02.05.10  Stopped in here about 20 minutes before last call.  Greeted and seated right away at the middle bar.  Decor is very mod.  Blue lights everywhere.  The restrooms are fresh and clean.  I loved it.  We ordered two Delux drafts and a double chocolate stout.  The lights come on.  The waiter urges us strongly to do a shot.  We knew it was a bad idea.  No go.  Then came the freshly baked cookies [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NJ0RzuWd5xDqfJejYQZ65g?select=RWLEGQXa2ss05mth8fxn-w].  So enticing.  The waiter says no free cookie until you take a shot.  We really wanted the cookies.  In the end, no shot, free cookies.  Extra star for service!"}
{"text":"Good draft beer selection but you should know what you want because the waitresses are often ckueless. Really good food, love the sweet potato fries. 40 taps and the kitchen is open late."}
{"text":"You don't expect Delux when you pull into the Safeway parking lot.  At night there's a phosphorescent blue glow drawing you in like a moth to the flame.   There is an outdoor seating area, which is actually pretty relaxing for being in a grocery store shopping center.  This time around we opted to sit inside, and to my delight were seated at the long lighted table in the center of the room!  I love this table because it always makes me feel like I've entered a much trendier, fashionable city than Phoenix.  The fact that they're also open until 2 am helps, too. There's not a lot I can say about Delux that hasn't already been said.  The atmosphere is enticing and the food is always excellent.  They serve Niman's Ranch beef, which always makes me happy, and the price is reasonable for the higher quality meat.  There's a great beer menu, if you're into that sort of thing, and a sizable list of other cocktails if you're not.   If you find yourself drifting towards a drive thru because it's getting late and you're craving a burger, reconsider and head towards Delux for a damn good burger and a drink."}
{"text":"We were all hungry for some great burgers and fries so we had heard about this place and decided to try it out. First of all we had a large group and the seating is mostly for groups of 4 or smaller. The staff created a little private area so all of us could still sit together which was awesome! When it came to the food most of us ordered different types of burgers from coby beef, to turkey burger, to veggie burger but we all agreed that they were some of the best we've experience in the valley! Also we ordered tons of fries they have regular and sweet potato or you can get a mixed batch, but the coolest part is the little mini shopping cart that they are delivered in! you should have seen our table littered with carts! Must try for those fans of a tasty burger!"}
{"text":"Tasty burger and great sweet potato fries!  Came here with a friend and was greeted right away from the hostess and I was very impressed with the blue hue and indoor ambiance. We decided to sit outside.   I ordered the delux burger served medium rare and we ordered fries that were half sweet potato and half regular fries. It's served in a tiny shopping cart basket, haha. I liked the sweet potato fries and the burger was juicy. Not my most favorite burger in the world, but it was good. It was served with like shredded carrots and beets on the side and I didn't know what to do with that! I put it on my burger just in case and it did nothing for the taste but perhaps the texture. I just didn't \"get it\" lol."}
{"text":"Delux is different, yeah it's different ...  Think outdoor pool club scene meets Niman Prime Angus gourmet burgers on Ciabatta meets sushi meets retro bakery menu. Sound weird? More like a true condensed description of Delux if you ask me.  To be honest I bookmarked Delux, because i love me a good burger and the little shopping cart holding the fries here are just so darn adorable- hey, what can I say I'm a sucker for cute packaging and eccentric food presentation.  I decided to go for their signature Delux burger and had a bottle of Kirin to share with my roomie- don't judge it was Happy Hour and the bottle was only $7.  Delux Burger- Fresh ground, all-natural, grain fed, niman ranch certified premium beef, caramelized onion & small bits of applewood smoked bacon, a blend of gruyere & maytag bleu cheeses & topped with baby arugula. served on a toasted, handcrafted demi-baguette (seems more like a ciabatta to me)  This is hardly a burger, if anything it's a burger for two. Comes in a demi baguette so it's in a strange oblong sandwich shape, nonetheless it is damn good! I got my patty medium- well and the beef was tender, juicy and had that signature niman ranch flavor. The cheese wasn't strong in bleu cheese and the touch of carmelized onions added a good sweetness. The arugula gave it a kick of pepper, but slightly and the bread was substantial enough to hold this huge burger all together without getting soggy.  Really good burger though I would say if you're a small gal like me share a burger with a friend and share an app as well. I ate only half of my burger and took the other half home and was stuff with the beer and all.   The environment was awesome to be in and service was good. A bit pricey, but for a gourmet burger this good- it's well worth it."}
{"text":"I visited Delux a few weeks ago with a friend after hearing about it via meetup.com Upon entering, I was immediately impressed with it's nightclub ambiance, blue lights, and the long table with high chair seats down the middle of the restaraunt. It felt ultra hip and trendy. The menu is very minimalist, but I immediately found something that peaked my taste buds.  My hot and sexy male waiter came over stared me and my friend in the eyes and took our order. We ordered mixed fries for the appetizer, which is a mix of sweet potatoe and brown potatoe fries with aioli sauce. they arrived in a tiny lil shopping cart, which was so cute my friend and i both took pictures with it. I ordered a delux burger because it came with gruyere cheese and I'd never heard of this cheese. I requested my buger not have bacon and well done. Another hot and sexy male waiter delivered our food and agin flirted with us. My burger was delicious. My friend and I were very impressed with the attractiveness of the waiters, we even left them a special love note because we are immature in that way, but we tip well to make up for it. I would return to Delux for both the food and great service."}
{"text":"The chicken salad was HUGE, but very tasty.  Service was a tad slow, but overall everything was very good."}
{"text":"We came her for dinner on a Sunday because oddseoul was closed and this happened to be next door.  What a great accident!  We had the Sunday oyster special  ($1 per oyster), corn cakes, squid, grilled chicken, cod, fries, chicken wings and the coffee creme brûlée, doughnuts and the dessert special of the day.  Fries and dessert special were ok.. The rest were delicious, especially the corn cakes and the grilled chicken. The cocktails (mojito and Caesar) were also yummy."}
{"text":"I'm not going to lie, I go here for the amazing sweet potato fries with the aioli. They are worth the wait - seriously one of my all time favorites. I'm not really a burger person, but the burgers are pretty good. Also they have a great beer selection...a lot beers. I have been here a couple times and it always is busy - they must do something right (my guess is the fries and the beer selection!)"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and had the pressed cubano sandwich. It was delicious, but very rich, buttery and meaty. Filling enough for 2 meals! The atmosphere was nice, and the server friendly. Great but nothing too unique or special. Wish they offered more lunch options than sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I LOVE DELUX!! This is the kind of restaurant I have been dreaming of. I always crave some quality food at late hours and Filberto's and McDonald's does NOT seem to cut it. The burgers are high quality and cooked to perfection, also the bread is amazing. I'm not a huge fan of bleu cheese and it's on the Delux burger so sometimes I will just substitute it for some Monterrey jack or American cheese. The mixed (regular & sweet potato) fries are a MUST! They come with an addicting aioli sauce that I always need extra to spread on my burger. Since the burger is so huge I always split with the manfriend. To top off a great meal we get the black and white milkshake which is vanilla with fudge (BOMB.COM). Regardless of the amazing food, the service is impeccable. My bf was super thirsty and was joking that the waiter would not be be able to keep up with his light speed water drinking. Well, sure enough, the waiter was crazy on top of it the whole meal. HAD to tip big--he was amazing. I will be sure to remember his name next time and update this review with props to him."}
{"text":"We absolutely love Delux - especially the sweet potato fries and the Delux Burger.  It's not uncommon for us to compare other places to what Delux offers.  We enjoy sitting at the bar, ordering a basket of the sweet potato fries and splitting a Delux Burger (cooked medium).  We also order more of the southwestern-style sauce (I always forget the name of it though).   Add a Sunbru beer or wine flight and 'heaven'!   :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite burger places I've visited, and I love me a good burger. The decor is nice and modern. They serve fries and sweet potato fries in a mini shopping cart, mixed if you want them. So yummy! The burger was great too. Nothing disappointing about this place. Quite impressive for a burger joint. I guess in America they take their burgers more seriously than in Canada."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today in Phoenix   Had the original burger and the mixed fries and beer flite.  Excellent food and service."}
{"text":"It's not like Delux needs another review, but oh well, here goes... I'd heard soo much about this place that it started to seem strange I hadn't tried it yet.  And while I don't eat meat and can't try this heralded burger, I did get to try both the grilled vegetable panini (my dish) and the panini grilled cheese (my boyfriend's dish)- and both were delicious.    Of course we had to get fries, but it was a really hard decision on what to get for dessert.  Should we opt for one of the amazing looking shakes we had seen going by on trays to neighboring tables or give in to the call of the GIANT banana split lava cake?  We gave in.  And it was wonderful.  This dessert was meant to share, but every bite I took was worth it.  I can't wait to go back to Delux again to have it, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Came here after reading some of the reviews and unfortunately was disappointed.  Ordered the delux sliders, half order of fries, and a vanilla shake.  Best part of the meal was the fries.  The texture of the burger was off - tasted almost rubbery and had vey little seasoning.  The shake too watery and didn't have much flavor.  Would rather get this combo at In N Out and save 10 dollars."}
{"text":"The hamburger plates even at one fifty-nine in the morning are huge!   So I was told by my ever so-sweet bartender during my lunch hour.  I ordered the Cool Caprese Panini. Inside the sandwich, they lay out the fresh thick Italian mozzarella, beautiful tomatoes. Then a spread of basil leaves and roasted red bell peppers. Served cool on a handcrafted demi-baguette, toasty.   I get a little baby dish and baby spoon of reduced balsamic and olive oil to drizzle on each bite.   Classic? no Amazing!  And for a tasty beverage. Lagers, wheat beers, specialty beers, beer flights, ales, wines, martinis. Many premium and luxury spirits. I even see a craft root-beer tap and would bet the ranch there is ice cream in the house.  Think twice before you stop somewhere else for another fast food sandwich.  Top Ten~"}
{"text":"This place by far makes the best \"designer\" burgers I have ever had, the Delux buger with maytag bleu, caramelized onions, and arugula is orgasmic! They have an unbelievable selection of delicious beer as well. I've had many meals and many late night meals there as they serve until 2am!!!"}
{"text":"The 2 Go section of Delux has me going back here after a long time away. I live right across the street now and don't seem to come to Delux as often as I used to when I lived way out in Mesa. The sandwhiches at this place are really awesome, especially the Tuna one. A little overpriced, but always a reliable standby."}
{"text":"Where the heck else are you going to find a dual burger/sushi joint?! How cool! AND its open late WITH a late night happy hour  Two establishments connected inside & styled the same but slightly separated. Didnt try a burger but the fries were great. Had 2 sushi rolls, caterpillar was good but lacking in eel. Late night happy hour scored me a shrimp tempura roll, pretty good, a bit disproportional in crab salad for my taste. Sushi menu is not very extensive but their beer list is. Overall i thought the place was super cool & while theres a bit of room to improve the menu, the concept is unique & service was fantastic."}
{"text":"A great burger and a great atmosphere.   The prices are a bit high, but high rent area, yet the food is great.  Get there early.  The noon crowd can make things busy."}
{"text":"Great food, but why did we have to get a bad server!! When I say bad, I asked for aioli and mustard when our burgers came out and I got to the point where I just walked up to the kitchen window and damn near was about to pour my own sauce. I know how it goes where people can get overwhelmed quickly and forget things, but that's what attributes to the overall experience.  Order from the late night happy hour with margarita (frozen and on the rocks) along with some sushi (from Zen) and the 2 slider burgers!!!   I don't make it by as often like I use when in the area, but the food, fries and atmosphere help to look past the 'odd' service. Other members of the staff helped out which was good. Even ordered a 2nd round of sushi to make sure we left 'fulfilled' with no lingering hunger.   Lots of options and good food so give anything a shot you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Best burger in town, best beet salad ever.  Fries to die for.  Banana split off the hook.  Groovy ambience for dinner, casual chic for lunch.  My most recent trip, took a business partner for lunch.  Wait was negligible at 12:30, and the staff was fantastically friendly and attentive.  Water refills are a luxury on a 95 degree day, and they were on the ball.  They have a great drink menu, including some fun beers that go well with the burgers.  I got the house lager this time, which was crisp and clean for the toasty day.  Burger is to die for--I think it's gruyere, caramelized onions and a baguette.  Skipped the fries this time and got the beet salad--perfection with goat cheese and candied pecans.  Reasonably priced--$25 for Beer, salad and burger.  Sweet!"}
{"text":"Great vibe and solid burgers. Tried their sushi for the first time and was impressed. Great place to catch a late meal."}
{"text":"Delux.  Since today was National Cheeseburger Day I thought it only right to go out and find a place where I can get a really good cheeseburger, and from all of the reviews, this sounded like the place. We started out with their take on Bruschetta for an appetizer, which while good, lacked a bit of flavor. The bread was a little too soft for my liking and they piled the mixture on so high that you had to lift your plate to your face just so it wouldn't fall all over the table when you took a bite. So for the main course, we obviously both got the classic cheeseburger and a half order of fries. The ingredients came on the side and the fries on a completely different plate. The array and design of the dishes and food looked wonderful. As we ate our cheeseburgers we both noticed that the burger had no flavor, like it hadn't been seasoned at all. Honestly, they could have just put some salt on it before the cooked it and it would have been perfect but it was lacking on that department. Other than that the burger and the ingredients (pickles,onion,tomatoes, and lettuce) were very fresh and tasty. The bun was the best part, cooked with perfection to a golden brown outside yet a perfect medium between crispy and soft. Very tasty! The fries came with this garlic Chipotle aoli sauce that was to die for! I was well satisfied with the meal. For dessert, we ordered the Classic Root beer float made with two scoops of Häagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream- and you can't really mess up a root beer float, so that was a perfect ender to an overall, pretty good lunch.  And to comment on the service, it was great. She came only a couple times when she needed to and not any more so we can enjoy our lunch. I give this jazzy joint a 4 out of 5 stars. And recommend you try it out for yourselves!"}
{"text":"WTF. this is a COMPLETE knockoff of Father's Office in LA!  Cheaters!!!!   HOW UN-ORIGINAL and TYPICAL OF PHOENIX.  Isn't this illigal?  http://www.fathersoffice.com/html/fathersOffice.html"}
{"text":"I got the Delux Burger and it was really good! The carmelized onions, feta/gruyere cheese, and arugula went really well with it! They actually recommend that you get your burger cooked medium-rare, which was perfectly fine with me since that's how I like my steak cooked. The ground beef was really high quality, too, so I definitely see why they recommend you order it that way. The only thing was that the bottom bun got crazy soggy. I ended up just getting rid of it all together. I love sweet potato fries and love how you can choose to order them mixed with regular potato fries, which is what I did. To be honest, the fries really weren't THAT amazing, but they were also only $3. Oh yeah, you also have to buy the fries separately. This isn't a place for penny pinchers, but it's also not super expensive considering the quality of the burger you are getting. No, it's not a spot to go to all the time, but if you're looking to get out and try a good quality burger, definitely go for it. I'd say it's worth it!"}
{"text":"I've been going there for years.  The place is small but the atmosphere and service make up for it. Fries served in a mini shopping cart. Good option for non burger eaters. The grilled cheese is pretty good.  Tip: Order your burger a step more done than you normally would."}
{"text":"The Delux burger with a Papago orange blossom beer is my favorite meal in AZ. Highly recommend the sweet potato fries also. You will need extra sauce, it's amazing."}
{"text":"We love the turkey burger here! It healthy, juicy and tasty. When you have different craving, you can get sushi or American food. Great options in a small place. They even have real wasabi. Now, they have TVs. They are small but, at least, there is something to watch."}
{"text":"Delux makes good burgers, but you probably figured that out already. They also have good fries (sweet and regular potato thank you very much). They are kinda expensive. If I have to compare it to something I would compare it to California Pizza Kitchen. Better than a regular Pizza, but probably not worth the cost."}
{"text":"Great late night sushi. Nothing amazing but consistent and tasty. Jeff does a great job at the sushi bar. Real crab is available which is awesome. Tara always takes great care of us. Happy hour is rockin. Shrimp tempura roll is delightful and I usually grab some yellowtail nigiri which is pretty good. Great for late night eats and good for a sushi craving."}
{"text":"If you like cow, you need to go to Delux.  They have the best burgers!  They even have a turkey burger if you are so inclined.    I always go with the Standard Classic Burger, cheddar, extra pickles.  Love it!  One thing to watch out for though - the last time I was there I asked for my burger medium and my dining partner ordered medium rare.  The burgers came out more like well done and medium well.  If this type of thing matters to you, stress to your waitress that you really do want it cooked the way you say you do.  Then again, it could have been an off night.  I love their sweet potato fries - a guilty pleasure that's also good for you.  Delux has a great beer selection too and I've found that the beer flights are the way to go.  The servings are generous and you get to try a few before committing to one.  For those who fear commitment, this is the place to be.  I've never made it to desert so I can't comment.  Finally, try to get there early or late, ahead or behind the crowd.  Delux is always busy at lunch and dinner time and I've almost always had to wait."}
{"text":"We have got to go from here a few times but sometimes the fries become soggy so we decided to dine in and apparently so did everyone in Arcadia because it was busyyy! When we got there around 8pm only the patio and bar were available so we opted for the patio. Even tho it's like 95 even when the sun is down it wasn't too bad with the misters. I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries and of course got the half/half basket- so good. I got the 1/2 caprese salad- taste just like every other place. Boyfriend got roast beef slider and mini burger which he enjoyed. Both great portions. The only bad thing was that our server was obviously sick. She couldn't even get through taking our order naming the cheeses without coughing at least five times. I just hope she washed her hands before touching the plates. It could've been allergies but she had a stuffy nose and legit couldn't stop coughing and it's not attractive when you're handling food."}
{"text":"I ordered the classic burger. The bun was over buttered and over toasted so that the first 1/4\" of both the top and bottom buns had the consistency of a crouton and overall a bit dry. The meat was juicy, well cooked, but lacking a little in flavor. The chopped iceberg lettuce was wilted and had started browning, and did not bring the fresh crisp texture that makes this burger so great (usually).   The side of fruit was not fresh and took away from the quality of the burger just by association.   Ordered a basket of the classic french fries and the chocolate shake both of which were the stars of the meal.   I have had this same meal here with satisfaction but this time we left disappointed. If the bun, lettuce, and fruit had been fresh our overall impression would have been positive. The tap beer selection and the fries will probably bring me back."}
{"text":"When I come here, I normally sit at the bar. Also, the bar area/restaurant is not crowded.   Beer list is ok for the area. It is better than some places that advertise themselves as a beer bar.   Bathrooms are not unisex, but normally clean.   Food is pretty good. It's nothing amazing, but a solid burger and sushi roll.  And good happy hour prices if you can come during that time.   If they are broadcasting a game over the speakers and also have it on at the bar, there is a 3-5 second delay between the broadcasts, which isn't pleasant to listen to.   Some bartenders are more attentive than others.  Sometimes my glass is never empty (water or alcohol) and sometimes I have to sit there for a while and flag the bartender down to get more water."}
{"text":"I had to try this after reading all the positive reviews here on Yelp. I was not disappointed.  The look of the place is very modern an chic. The wait was only 20 min on a Saturday night, the service was excellent. The group seating was unique, but enjoyable.  I savored my Delux burger and tried my gf's Panini Chicken sandwich - both were delicious. We also tried the sweet potato and french fries with an amazing mayo-chili sauce they served along with ketchup. The iced tea was really good too (which is hard to find).  I will definitely keep Delux on my radar."}
{"text":"The food is good, no complaints there. The service however, seems to be slipping lately. Brad is awesome (I'm bad with names so I am only 97.4% sure that's really his name) and has helped me a few times and was great and always talks to me when I come back even when he hasn't been our server (why I don't ask to be seated in his section, I do not know). One of the assistant managers is also great and very friendly and personable. It's everyone else there that seems to be the issue. One female server was nice just not personable at all. One male server was just kind of lame. It's the last one that I really had an issue with. Not friendly, not personable. I went there at around 10:30pm with a friend of mine. We split the caprese salad and she ordered a half basket of sweet potato fries. I had a beer and hotdog and then we split a milkshake. He brought my friend a mixed basket of fries. She was ok with that so we didn't say anything. Later in the meal he came back and left the bill and we had to flag him down to ask for dessert. He brought it  and left the bill again. My friend and I were going dutch and each paid with separate credit cards. After putting the cards in the bill...thing (is there a more technical term for it?) he quickly walked by picked it up didn't say anything to us or come to ask how we wanted it split, he just split it 50/50. That was really annoying! I mean more so for my friend than me since my portion was much more expensive than hers. I still give it 3 stars though. If they can kick the service back up to where it used to be, they'll get 5 stars again in no time!"}
{"text":"The most DEE-LICIOUS BRUNCH I have had in ages!  Delux does Cuban brunch on Sundays (yes, only Sundays) from 11am-3pm.    My fab femmes and I visited here and were blown away by the scrumptious food. I had the duck confit hash with rice & beans, salad, tostanos (fried plantain) topped with two sunny side up eggs. My dining companions had the breakfast sandwiches and the Cuban breakfast.   Complete silence ensued once the food arrived - it was so good we had to stop the small talk for awhile.  Brunch is reasonably priced from $8-$14. Booze (mimosas, mijitos) were $8 each. Cuban coffee, americanos and cafe con leches were also available. Homemade in-house donuts and fritters available for $5 a plate.  We were seated in a comfy little booth, but there were some regular tables too. Nice decor and friendly hipster-ish staff.  I'm not sure I would return here for dinner, but I will definitely back for brunch. A new favourite for sure."}
{"text":"To me, Delux is just your typical burger joint that seems so atypical nowadays. The burgers are pretty decent and the fries are pretty yum. I would say go if you're in the area. But, I prefer the burrito place next door."}
{"text":"Delux is the perfect place if you are looking for a good classic burger and a cart full of fries (I like the sweet potato). The ambience isn't my favorite, the tables are jammed packed inside. It's worth eating 4 inches from your neighbor at this place though!   The burger: Great seasoned beef patty with fresh vegetables sandwiched between the perfect bun! I am a big fan of the med rare. There is so much flavor in this burger.  Cart of Fries: I like to do the combo, reg and sweet potato, with the aioli sauce. Yum!!   This would be in my top 3 places to go for a burger and fries. I would advise getting the turkey burger at Keegans. Delux's seems a little dry."}
{"text":"Super nice and relaxing. Very friendly! I enjoyed myself quite a bit. The food was well cooked and nicely presented. Everything was up too par. Very nice. Would recommend to grab a bite or drink."}
{"text":"Came in for some Magic Hat #9s upon arrival in Phoenix and it was a great first stop! We also ordered the Delux Mini Turkey Burgers with Sweet Potato Fries. The burgers were thick, juicy and supremely savory and the fries were crunchy and mouth-watering. The meal paired so well with our beers too. We didn't want it to end! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Passing through the Biltmore area, we were in the mood for some good quality burgers, and thought, we'd give Delux a try!  Was it worth it?  Location & Aesthetics - located off East Camelback Road, on the corner of N 32nd. Street and E Camelback, in the Biltmore area/section of Phoenix, and in the same compound with Safeway grocery.  Lots of available parking that's separate from Safeway's parking area.  This particular area does have a couple other restaurants so you may have to drive around (within the parking lot) to find a parking spot which isn't totally inconvenient in my opinion. The interior decor is nice though, I thought, a bit on the small side.  There is outdoor seating, and I believe there was a heating lamp outside for those chilly evenings.  At the time we went, it was around 3:00 PM and the place wasn't too busy on one side. I say \"one side\" as apparently there's two sides to the restaurant -- side with the bar and, if I'm not mistaken, the side that served the burgers; and the other side, I believe, was for the sushi though I could be wrong on this assessment. We were seated on the side for the burgers (for the purpose of this review) as that's why we were there.  There was seating with high chairs that seemed appropriate for couples or just two folks grabbing a bite to eat; and seating with tables, chairs, and booth-styled (though not entirely) seating against the wall.  As I was in a party of three, our greeter was kind enough to join a table together for us.  As I mentioned before, the interior did seem on the small side (-1).  If a medium-to-large sized group came in, I'm not sure how they'll finagle the seating to accommodate.  Lighting was ample with enough light from outside streaming in through the front windows.  There were TV's on the walls but appeared muted.  Noise level wasn't bad.  Dress is casual.  Menus - were quickly brought to our tables, and we were quickly acknowledged by waitstaff!  The drinks menu was quick extensive as well as the dining menu, which were both comprehensible to read and understand.  Waitstaff was happy to answer any questions we had on either menus.          Service - very prompt!  Drinks were brought to our tables, followed by a small wait, then our food.  Waitress visited our table frequently to see if we had any issues, concerns, or complaints, and always appeared with a warm pleasant smile.   Even as we entered, the greeter gave a warm welcome and was prompt to acknowledge us we walked in, asking whether we wished to dine outside or inside, and provided us with options of tables as there were three of us.  Wait time for the food wasn't bad considering one in the party ordered the Delux burger cooked well, and I wanted mine cooked medium-to-well.    Food - I had their signature Delux burger -- premium beef with the Niman Ranch signature seal, their signature infusion of caramelized onions, bits of applewood smoked bacon, blend of gruyere and maytag bleu cheeses, and topped with baby arugula.  All of this is served on a handcrafted demi-baguette!   If you don't know much about beef or products from Niman ranch, I highly encourage you to research it on the web to discover more about their mission. The burger, once presented to you, doesn't look round like your usual burger, but instead, looks similar to grinder sandwich. One phrase to sum up the experience of eating this burger -- it is to die for, and out of this world (okay two phrases).  The burger tasted great -- really fresh; cooked to perfection and as I had asked -- well done; juicy; and really well seasoned.  It certainly didn't taste like your ordinary ground chuck you pick up from the supermarket.  The buns were freshly baked, warm, and soft.  The smoked bacon added that extra bit of smokiness to it; the caramelized onions a bit of sweetness; the cheeses gave it a slight bit of acidity; plus the arugula seasoning, though unusual and never thought could be used on a burger, was a great surprise that provided a slight peppery flavor to the whole burger. For my drink I ordered their Haagen-Dazs vanilla shake which comes with whipped cream and a cherry on top.  Let me tell you, this shake isn't your regular shake and probably that's because it's made with Haagen-Dazs ice-cream -- it made it very authentic tasting....the real deal!  It was super creamy, rich, and thick, and was served with two straws in case you wished to share (yeah, right).  What I particularly liked is that, even though it's served in a traditional milkshake glass, they will bring a metal cup and spoon with the remainder of the shake for you.  In other words, the remaining portion of the shake isn't wasted!      Despite the time we arrived was still 3 PM, they were still serving the lunch menu which entitled you fries with your burger.  I ended up choosing my usual favorite -- sweet potato fries.  The portion size was adequate, and were fresh, warm/hot, and not soggy or limp, but actually very crispy.  A definite must return!"}
{"text":"Best sweet potato fries in town! We went on a busy Friday night & got right in at the bar! Chinese chicken salad was good & not soaked in sauce but would prefer all white chicken meat.  Not a lot of options for non red meat, carb eaters but environment is worth it! It's tempting to splurge for a hamburger!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice as we just moved next door, so we can walk.  Douglas has been our server both times. Service rocks...burgers and fries good...and their house wine is really good. This last time we sat on the Zen 32 side where they serve you complimentary Edamame, and I also got the Seaweed salad that chef made special for me with just the right amount of spice that I requested...kinda like he was in my head.. We enjoy  coming here and happy that we live so close."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite burger place.  Very high quality in every aspect of the food.  Full bar and great beer menu too.  Plus they're open late."}
{"text":"Excellent place with excellent service, and great food, our server douglas was very helpful with all our needs, We will definitely come back. The owner and manager would come by our table to check on us, we had a problem with one of our drinks and they went above and beyond expectation to make sure we were happy; just overall excellent service!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Delux!! The turkey burger is the bomb.com!!! I have yet to be disappointed. The ingredients are always fresh. The food is always hot. Customer service isnt bad either. If you are into beer...they have a fantastic selection. If you like fruity beer...try the Flight #3...its soo tasty. This will always be one of my fav spots in Phoenix....will def go back"}
{"text":"Delux is amazing! The turkey burger is one of my favorites. Ask for Phillip -- he's the best server. Oh and if you have a sweet tooth or are celebrating ANYTHING, get the milkshake. Thank me later. :)"}
{"text":"Their fries are the best! The food is great and I can always get a good martini here. Plus they are open late, have patio seating and added sushi to their menu. Definitely a must try!!"}
{"text":"They changed my life.  I never have been a huge fan of burgers. But after going there last week my life has been flipped upside down. I went at 1 am and the guys who came with me, complained that they didnt want to wait 10 minutes for a table or shell out 9.50 for a burger, so I opted for takeout. When I finally got back home the bun was soggy and was luke warm, but even through all the faults I could taste that I was in love. If a soggy burger can get me going I know this place is fantastic. Moral of the story I wont be taking those friends with me out anymore and I will with out a doubt be eating in next time. I cant wait!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go food and received it cold. And the lettuce that came on the burger was from last week .. i shit you not this lettuce is pink . How could any restaurant even think that is ok to serve  do not recommend this place to any one"}
{"text":"Come on down for the best late night happy hour! 40+ craft beers. Burgers are out of this world. Then there are the fries. Wow."}
{"text":"Fries were soggy and over salted.  Mayo condiment very salty.  Burger was ok kind of cold.  Bacon cheese mix nothing special says applewood bacon but the waiter explained to me it was like bacon bits.  Bacon bits really?  The hype is why people come but honestly there are way better burger places out there.  It's a trendy place with fancy lighting and a nightclub type atmosphere. I came at lunch and there is no lunch price its still $9.50 cents for burger with no fries.  Grain feed, organic I get it.  Thats why it is pricey.  But it should knock my socks off and this place does not. Comes with carrots and beet strings hmmm.  Good for groups but it is family style seating in the middle of the burger joint.  I did notice they have a large selection of not your typical beers so I may come back one day for a brew."}
{"text":"The burger was good, but not delicious enough for 13+ dollars. Not sure I would go here again unless it's really late and nothing else was open."}
{"text":"Amazing burger, drinks and service. Haven't tried the sushi but I've heard good things. Never a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I have now been here three times and every visit has been a fun adventure. This visit was the first time that I experienced the sushi and I was not disappointed. Our group ordered three sushi rolls, two hamburgers and a order of mixed fries as well as two beers and a glass of house red wine.  We finished the meal with key lime pie. Everything was marvelous. The sushi rolls were fresh and flavorful with enough ginger and wasabi to satisfy any palette. The hamburgers were very tasty and you can choose any cheese you want to top your burger. Because the meat is so fresh I recommend cooking the burger medium so that you don't have too much juice making your bun soggy. This establishment has an exceptional beer selection so don't be afraid to try one of the many local brews on tap. You can also try a beer flight if you want a variety of beers to taste. The key lime pie is to die for! If you eat at unconventional times this place stays open until 2 am.  This is a must-visit restaurant if you want a great meal (burgers or sushi) in a fun environment with friendly and knowledgable wait staff."}
{"text":"It's kinda small and you have to plan early to get a table reservation. The steak-frites is a work of art. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Love this place.  This review is long overdue.  My girlfriend and I hit this place up late one night when we were craving food.  We know it was a burger place but had heard it had good sushi also, so we decided to give it a shot.  This was an excellent idea.    We got there and were seated in the sushi side as that was what we were craving.  Tara was our server and she was awesome.  She made some great recommendations based on what we liked.  We ordered a few rolls and had a couple of drinks.  Here is some info on the rolls we shared:  Lollipop roll - good, light, looks like a lollipop  Samba - excellent and tasty, little bit of heat on the back end - teriyaki-ish  Vegas roll - very good, lightly fried but great flavor  Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"Why did it take me so long to come here??  I've heard about Delux since it opened and finally made it here.   I quickly browsed over the menu and saw they have a \"Delux Burger.\"  Namesake = Order.  So I did.  Along with a half order of half fries and half sweet potato fries. I make some of the best decisions ever made.  The fries are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  They are on the skinnier side of the fry spectrum, but not the skinniest I've had.  I love crispy fries.  These were the best, I said it, BEST sweet potato fries I've ever consumed. Onto the burger... I ordered mine medium but would have preferred medium well.  It was a bit pinker than I'm used to for medium.  It was delicious, nonetheless.  I'm not a big fan of arugula, but could hardly taste it because the flavors from the cheese, beef, bacon, and onions.  It was definitely a gourmet burger.   They offered tasting flights of beer that we had to talk ourselves out of since we were having lunch during a work day.  I can't wait to go back and be able to enjoy a beer with a burger.  Yum!!"}
{"text":"I was a little hesitant in giving this place a shot. Sushi and burger just seemed like a weird combo but after my visit I realize  it's perfect combo. I know not everyone loves sushi so it's a great spot to for a group of friends with different taste in food. I may love sushi but I am aware not all my friends are sushi fans so hello burgers and fries. Not only was the sushi delicious but so were the burgers and fries.   I can tell the company prides itself in its customer service. They had a sign at our table requesting anonymous feed back. Our server was great and they even gave us a free basket of their fries/sweet potato fries and dessert since their kitchen was a little backed up. The best part was we didn't even have to say anything they thought it was an issue and corrected it.   Overall was impressed with the place, food and service."}
{"text":"Delux is a great place!    My girlfriend and I went there for dinner the other night because someone told her that they had great vegi-burgers there.  I can always go for a burger, so I was game.  Well, she was let down (initially!) since they don't have vegetarian patties.  They do, however, have many other vegetarian delights!  She had the grilled cheese and enjoyed it.  I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was cooked to perfection.  The bacon wasn't too crunchy or too soft, and the bun tasted and felt fresh.  We got the normal fries, and they were very good.  Not too thick, and tasted fresh.  They give you a variety of sauces to dip them in.  The service was beyond excellent!  Our waitress was on the ball.  She filled our drinks very often, brought out our food with amazing speed, and was very attentive in all she did.  There are a few minor things I didn't like.  Certainly nothing enough to take away from the rating.  The restaurant feels cramped.  Inside, you may have to share a table with others you don't know in bar-like seating, and outside on the patio, they shoved in as many tables as they could fit, and the seats aren't all that comfortable.  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about this hamburger place and was very excited to try.  Was not disappointed. The burger was tasty and HUGE.  I could have split it with someone.  And I loved the sweet potato fries and dipping sauce. The seating on the inside is a little odd as we sat at a long bar across from one another but the space is not big so they had to be creative.  Wish that the prices had been a little less but if I split it, it would have been a perfect cheap lunch."}
{"text":"This is seriously the BEST burger I have ever had (The Delux Burger, cooked medium).   Sweet potato fries are great as well. Open late every night. Also do takeout."}
{"text":"Any review of Delux requires an obligatory mention of the Los Angeles landmark restaurant Father's Office, whose concept was all but completely plagiarized by Delux. I always say, though, it doesn't matter who came up with the idea, it matters who executes it. And, I like how Delux executes the concept. High-end burgers, delicious craft beer selection and great service in a cozy (and hip) location.  Of course, I have to be the weirdo -- I am also a vegetarian, so I can't have a burger anyway. Instead, I grabbed the amazing grilled cheese, which they grill panini-style, cut into quadrants. The baguette, as usual, was perfectly toasty, firm, yet chewy. There is a great variety of craft beers -- everything from Alaskan Amber to Stone IPA. The service is always good, although this time our server was particularly flirty. He actually sat down with my dining companions and I to chit chat. It was charming and fun and certainly added to the fun (and enjoyment) of the meal.  Another mandatory purchase at Delux is the fries -- available in sweet potato, regular, or half and half. The fries are served in a mini shopping cart (familiar to anyone who has been to Father's Office). They are perfectly seasoned and served with a delicious aioli dipping sauce.  Delux is a perfect place to have a sandwich and day drink on a warm afternoon, and I am looking forward to the temperature cooling off so I can waste a few Sundays there. And, of course, Delux is open till 2 a.m., so it is a great option for late nights as well."}
{"text":"I don't know where to start. Walk in at 2 pm on Sunday. 6 people are there counting us. Place our orders and I ask for a root beer float. $7.95. After a few minutes I'm told they have to purchase root beer next door. After 15 minutes our food comes out, waitress still busy shopping for root beer next door at Safeway. They usually have root beer on draught; something that sort of justifies $8 for the float. Another 10 minuets go by and we've just about finished our food and a root beer over ice in a cup comes to the table. I tell the server I ordered a root beer float and she apologizes and has it made. Ready to pay my bill, and holding a fresh can of \"A&W from Safeway\"$8.00 root beer float would have been ok if the burger was good, which it wasn't. The burger was ok at best And to top it all off I was charged for a root beer and a root beer float. Worst experience I've had going out to eat in a very long time."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I've been coming here for the past year and every time it has been amazing. The happy hour prices are definitely worth it so I try to visit when that's going on. The sushi is amazing, always tastes fresh and I've never had an issue with the quality of my food. The service is great, I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to be seated and the server Tara is amazing! I definitely recommend asking for her when coming in."}
{"text":"Delux is by far one of the best beer and burger spots in the valley. I recommend getting a classic with double applewood smoked bacon and cheddar. Add a mini-shopping cart filled with sweet potato and regular fries and you have the perfect cure for previous evening overindulgences!   As an added bonus, Delux is currently featuring Lagunitas Brown Shugga' on tap, which is an amazing american strong ale."}
{"text":"AWESOME! I would elaborate further but I'm mowing down a killer Delux burger..... yum!"}
{"text":"OMG I just found this little place no one has ever heard of called Delux. Yea, Delux, without the e at the end. Tre creative. Ok, so it's my first visit and here goes. Service was great. Thank you Lacy. Room was comfy, we sat at the large community table, had great people watching. Fries were yummy tho a VERY small portion in exchange for one Abraham. The Delux Burger had no flavor of Maytag Blue cheese (or Kenmore for that matter...god that's not even remotely funny) or bacon. Cupcake at the end was dee lish. My favorite part was a picture of Pink's hot dog stand on La Brea in L.A. that adorned the wall.  Although my freshman Delux experience was aight....I couldn't help but stare at the framed photo of my second favorite weenie stand in the good ole u s of a! Three stars. That's all."}
{"text":"I love that this place is open late and has two of my favorite things, FRIES and SUSHI!! Its weird to think of burgers and sushi in the same restaurant but they're both SO good!! I'm just obsessed with their sushi. The sushi rice is always cooked perfectly. My go to late night sushi spot"}
{"text":"Great palace for a midnight snack ! The food is ok but the staff are super friendly , very friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I have to say I'm surprised at how many people love this place.  I had the Delux burger, and it was as two stars says...Meh.  I would not go running back there for another one, especially at $10.50 a pop.  I will say the mixed basket of regular and sweet potato fries was tasty ($6.00 but enough to share).  The burger lacked flavor, even with all the toppings including caramelized onions.  Nothing popped when you would bite into it, and even the bun was a little soggy.  I would go to In and Out and get a tasty burger for a better price before going back.  OR, stop in at Blu Burger for a tastier burger at the same price."}
{"text":"Tried this place late Sunday night and it was AMAZING. The vibe of this place is great, service and food are just as great. My girlfriend and I ordered sushi and burgers. We have both decided this was the best sushi we've ever had, Vegas roll is a must try! I got the classic burger and it was great! The bun was super buttery and soft. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight after my soccer game for a beer and a bite.  I really enjoyed the styling of the place nice patio for outdoor dining and a cool inside dining area with blue accent lights.  Started out with their huge beer menu and got a basket of fries.  The fries come out in a mini shopping cart which was pretty cool.  Right before we start to eat Bob Saggat and Frankie Muniz came in.  Figured I had came to the right spot for a burger now.  Sure enough the food was amazing.  I'm glad I stopped in and for sure will be back again."}
{"text":"I love love love Delux.. Can't believe I haven't reviewed. I have never been disappointed. Delux Burger.. fries.. beer.  It's all about the buns.. soft, pillowy buns.  Then the meat.. juicy, rare, and flavorful.  Throw cheese, onions, and bacon on that bitch, and it's over. You're crazy for this one D-   Hov"}
{"text":"The Cuban sandwich was super tasty. We're visiting from out of town and were taken here by our local friends. I really liked the atmosphere and the service was great....we did have to wait for water refills a few times, but the waiters were obviously slammed and doing the best they could so it wasn't a major demerit. We got a Cuban to share for the table as an app and I got the roast chicken as my main.  We got the fresh baked cookies for dessert as well as this interesting peach and cream thing. The cookies were gooey and warm, but not the best cookies I've had. Didn't stop me from eating them though! The peach dessert was a really interesting complex dish. I'm not usually a fan of fruit desserts but you could tell a lot of thought and effort went into it's creation, which I can appreciate.  Overall I really enjoyed our meal here and would come back..."}
{"text":"I visited Delux in my search for a replacement for Induldge, which sadly closed a couple months ago. Amazing cheeseburger, great fries. The chocolate shake was way too rich (must have been haagendaz). The tables are super close together and it was packed even during an \"off\" time. No Indulge replacement, but a really good burger and fries - if they could just get their chocolate shake in line ;)"}
{"text":"I always come here with bae late at night.. There's not many restaurants that are open this late... besides fast food and this is def the spot I like to come to for a late night healthy meal!   I usually order the Chinese Delux Salad, California roll and the spicy salmon roll. Yum!"}
{"text":"So I left 4 starts but didn't explain why and I apologize for that. This place has fantastic burgers and food and service but at a more significant price than necessary. While the food is great there was nothing in the burger that particularly stood out. The meat is juicy and fantastic and the quality of the ingredients is amazing but that being said getting 2 sliders was over $10 and French fries were extra.   I understand that it's in a nice area and appreciate the restraunt as a whole I was just hoping for a more unique burger experience. That being said there are plenty of other options I havent tried and if you want high quality product this place is still most definitely worth seeing"}
{"text":"Telus Tuesday Specials Restaurant #2   I wish Delux will keep its Cuban flare for their dinner menu... I tried really hard to find anything remotely Cuban... aside from the Pressed cubano Sandwich....   I asked my waiter which items on their menu that is close to Cuban cuisine... and he went hmmmmmm ... and said just try the chicken.. since the chef used Achiote and lime as marinade....   Oysters on half Shell ($15)  - great oyster flavour and fresh.. that hint of crisp apple migonette did enhanced the flavour...  - I finished that in record speed... and I want more more oysters!   Salt Roasted Pear ($11)  - I don't know why I enjoy what my date vegetarian option more... maybe I am slowly converted..........   Achiote and Lime Roasted Chicken ($21)  - The chicken was surprising juicy... even the breast area which usually dry turned out to be nice and tender...  - A-OK! But did not Wow me...   Cuban Coffee Creme Brulee ($7)  - Now.. I discover this ongoing pattern.. what your date ordered is always more tasty!!  - Not the best creme brulee I have, but rich and creamy... and yes I was glad that someone nice shared it with me!  - The coffee taste was not really strong... just a hint...   Buttermilk Doughnuts with Chantilly Cream ($7)  - Fresh and Hot Doughnuts... crispy and crunchy on the outside.. soft and warm inside...  - Good tasting as doughnuts.. but they don't really satisfy my sweet tooth   The drinks!! $11 for a Mojito and other cocktails are a little pricey.... I am not surprise when no other tables around us ordered any cocktails, most of them either drink beer or wine...   Will I come back? Maybe for lunch... but I found the dinner menu uninspiring... but I am glad that I came for the Telus Offers!!  BTW, my date was still hungry after eating here with the 3 course meals...maybe Delux knows she wants to be on a diet?"}
{"text":"This is a well-kept secret, at least it was to us.  Came in at 10:30 Monday night and the place was bustling.  Great atmosphere with cozy lighting and that certain neighborhood feel to it. Happy hour M-F 4-7 and reverse Happy Hour after 10 pm.  The food was absolutely delicious and the service was immaculate and on top of that, it was very reasonable.  Not only did our server Xtian do a fabulous job but there was also a manager there who checked up on us. This is a must go to place and we will certainly be back and tell others."}
{"text":"What a pleasure it is to eat at this restaurant! It's charm lies within the combination of flawless service,a unique and diverse clientele base and it's absolutely beautiful decor. Add in some great happy hour specials with good a sushi and burgers,my friend you are in for treat.  The music late night is fantastic and sets a good vibe along side the low ambient lighting. A date night would go well for both parties in this wonderful setting. I highly recommend you eat,drink  and even mingle here! :)"}
{"text":"Great Burgers and Great Sushi!  Sushi was fresh and cold... I've been eating sushi for years, and if it is not the correct cold temperature I will not eat it.. perfect balance of rice to sushi on the rolls, they slice thick pieces of deliciously fresh quality fish, not like the terrible place I ate in Chandler, called Sushi Room.. UGH .. now called Rock Lobster I hear... anyway would NEVER go there again.. so back to Delux.. I live in Chandler and yet I still CHOOSE to drive here to eat sushi; and the burgers are absolutely deliciously fresh and I just love the decor here..  You wont be disappointed with either meat or fish !!! enjoy!!"}
{"text":"My buddy is moving to Phoenix, he needed somewhere to park his car for a week (my house), and he needed a ride to the airport.  He let me know that he was buying lunch on the way down to the airport.  I hadn't been to Delux in about 6 months and a burger sounded great. I mentioned to him how good their burgers were (Best in Phoenix!), and he wanted to try it out.  Free Delux Burger?  Yes...yes indeed!    We walked in, were seated immediately and served water (the waiter instinctively brought my son his own plastic cup with a lid on it...I appreciated it.).  I noticed that they had a little pop up flyer/table piece that was advertising their \"Lunch Special\" between 12-4 any day of the week, you could get a Delux burger and fries for $12.00.  Um.....SOLD!   I ordered my Delux burger medium rare and got regular fries (you have your choice of sweet potato also).  Here is how it was.........  Delux Burger-  Nothing has changed!  And that is exactly what I wanted to see.  Delux burger is hands down the best burger in Phoenix, and it's definitely in my top 3 burgers in the USA.  They use superb quality Niman Ranch beef, which is absolutely perfect when cooked medium rare.  Juicy, tasty and flat out delicious.  The baguette they use is perfect.  Its sturdy, yet soft and chewy and is the perfect bread for this type of burger.  Sandwiched between this great bread and on top of the burger are blue and gruyere cheese, some baby arugula, and their caramelized onion/bacon jam/spread.  The flavors work so well together, its absolute perfection.  Find a better burger in Phoenix.  I dare you!  The fries were good (the few that I had, because my son, Bill, mowed down 80% of my fries, as well as about half of my buddies.)    Can't say enough about Delux!  Service is always friendly, the food is always fantastic, and every single person I have brought here, has loved it.  Don't change a thing, Delux...don't change a thing!  See you soon for another fantastic burger!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing burgers. Unfortunately, if you get a burger you have to buy fries separately...however, the fries are big enough to share! Give this place a try if you are near by."}
{"text":"SETTING: desert/1:30 a.m./Tuesday/the club is not goin' up/I'm disappointed to be awake/alive/hungry.  PLOT: *SPOILER ALERT* I remember Delux is open/I go get a hella juicy Delux burger/plus a wee shopping cart of \"how I like my men\" mixed fries.  EPILOGUE: Everything was great/I'd totally eat here not at 1:30 a.m./please someone help with this insomnia/never mind I'm just gonna go back to Delux."}
{"text":"Oh Boy. This could be grounds for divorce as my husband loves Delux, but I just can't give it more than three stars. Why? INCONSISTENCY. Don't get me wrong, I've had 5-star nights at Delux but I've also had 2-star nights so here I stand.  The beer selection is fantastic, the wine list is okay and  the menu is simple and what you'd expect from a burger joint - burgers, a hot dog, salads and few apps but there's just something missing for me. The service is okay. I don't think we've ever had exceptional service at Delux. It's always \"okay\" or \"good.\" I like the community table (although I wish the seats were more comfortable) and the outside patio is good when the weather is nice (if you can get over the fact that everything in Phoenix is in a strip-mall and you have views of the Safeway parking lot).  Overall, if I'm going to spend $60-$100 for a beer, wine & burger night with my husband - I want it to be spot on and unfortunately, you just can't count on Delux for delivering that all the time.   If you're in the area looking for a burger joint with a good vibe check out Zin Burger at the Biltmore Mall."}
{"text":"Bar none, the BEST place in Phoenix to get a burger. I took a friend here for lunch today (Ada G.) and we split the Delux Burger (medium rare) and the sweet potato fries and each had a hard cider. I've been telling her how good it is and she's been wanting to see for her self and she wasn't disappointed.   The fries always come out first in their cute little grocery cart and we each get our own dipping sauces (ketchup and some kind of chipotle aioli?). Once we gorged ourselves on those, our burger came (we split, how else can we be expected to keep our girlish figures?) and it was on to the second course. The patty is always the perfect medium rareness. The juice from the meat melds with the Gruyere and blue cheeses and makes the perfect sauce with the caramelized onions. It's topped with arugula and is served on a baguette. When you get this, don't change a thing. It's perfect as it. It would be a travesty to play god and change these beautiful flavors. I love this burger. I could eat another one now. If I could write poetry I would write it a poem, but I can't so I'll just stop now. And maybe plan my next visit."}
{"text":"Best burger in town. Easily. The sweet potato fries are great too.   I think burger-purists will have a hard time getting past the modern decor and scenester crowd, but I count all that on the plus side. I've never been treated poorly or felt uncomfortable.   But the burger is so good that I'd even compare it favorably to national-renowned burgers like those at Corner Bistro and the Shake Shack in New York.    And the late hours are great too."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. Is it because it's in the same plaza as a gelato joint and zen 32? Oooh, and sweet potato fries served in a cutesy mini shopping cart?...no thanks. The burger was just so-so, but nothing I wanted to even continue eating after the first bite. On the plus side, better than IHOP or Denny's for a late night, after the bar meal."}
{"text":"Seriously?  Went back with my family and ordered the same Vegas roll. Service was a lot faster than I remembered so high five for that, but I looked at my roll and it was deja vu.   Guess what was missing from my roll ... again.   I looked over the wall and yep, it was the same sushi chef who forgot the last time as well. Even the server was surprised it happened again. The director of operations came up and apologized, saying that the sushi chef was new, but that's what they told us the last time and that was back in July. If this much time has passed and they still consider him new, I'm going to start using that excuse at the office asap. Throughout the rest of the night, the sushi chef kept glaring at my boyfriend and I who was facing him, giving us the stink eye because the manager spoke to him about his mistake. As long as he didn't spit in my sushi, I don't really care. I just want to eat what I paid for because eel is not cheap these days.   Food is still good, that's why I come back. I just always hope it's the other sushi chef that's working when I walk in and not this dude who looks like he wants to throw his knife at me over the sushi bar Kill-Bill style."}
{"text":"I thought the burgers were really good. Cooked perfectly. Service was really good also. I appreciate when the wait staff doesnt come by every 5 minutes to see how things are. It was overall a really good dinning experience."}
{"text":"i think this place is a tad over-rated. the food is good but because they are always so over crowded and busy, their service is extremely slow. the wait is rarely less than 15 minutes. my husband loves their selection of beers, but if i want sweet potato fries...fez has better.   i'm not huge on the crowd. it's just really loud and the seating arrangements aren't very comfortable for having to pay such an expensive tab. i go when i'm invited or when i have a lot of time to kill, but it's not my first choice when i go out to eat."}
{"text":"Don't come for the burgers or the sandwiches.  Come for the fries and the atmosphere.   I agree with most of the reviews, the fries are awesome and its a great people watching place.  They have the tilted mirrors.  I would have given it one star but the fries are really good (mainly the dipping sauce).  Its kinda cramped so look out for large parties.  The bathrooms are large, clean, stylish, lockable, and unisex. So if you don't go for the food at least go for the fun."}
{"text":"As I have mentioned in a couple of my other reviews, I am not a big fan of burgers. However, after a good experience at Smashburger I figured maybe I could enjoy if they are done right. A friend had kept wanting to try this place so I finally gave in.  My thoughts? Meh. I was completely underwhelmed by this place. I love their fries. It's the only thing I have had there before and those are still good. The burger though? No flavor... I asked for it minus the arugula (not a fan of the stuff) and I realized after I had left disappointed that they also managed to leave the bacon off. I certainly didn't ask for that. If that had been on there it might have been a little better. But even then I don't think it would have been a good burger.   If someone talks me in to going here again I will likely just stick with the fries. Get the combination basket, half sweet potato and half regular."}
{"text":"Didn't sit down, this review is for the 2Go part of the business. It seemed totally packed the night I went through there and was able to wait for my order on a small bench near a TV that was showing the local NBA game. I had a good experience overall. This is a burgers/panini/grill type of place that doesn't scrimp on the arugula. Really enjoyed the fries, both sweet potato and normal. Also had a salad. It was all good. Ingredients seemed high quality. Relatively quick turnaround despite tons of diners. The decor was blue LEDs and sorta club- y which is ok by me. There was a sushi bar that I didn't try (sorry I have a rule about eating raw fish in the desert). Would totally go there again for take out."}
{"text":"Surprised to find this place open (until 2 AM) on a Sunday with great food choices and a bar !! Our Server\"Caleb\" was WONDERFUL. Drinks were good, food was fresh, hot and tasty. Delux is the whole package: Open, late, nice outdoor seating area, good food, great customer service (@ midnight no less) - ask for Caleb if your lucky enough to get seated in his section. Would have given it 5 stars but liquor selections were limited, however, if your a wine, beer, basic martini (signature \"Deluxtini\" was delicious) or jack & coke kinda person - 5 Stars all the way !! Did I forget to mention the ample parking !!"}
{"text":"Wowza! I can't to come back! This place is super cute, unpretentious, the service is amazing and the food, well, HOH. MY.  If you want a burger, this is definitely a place to check out. Seriously. Looking at the photos from last night is making me crave a burger now.  At breakfast time. (Ok, so I started writing this review before breakfast. Fast forward many, many hours later today and I'm still craving another one!)  My super awesome fella suggested this place 1) for their impressive beer list (yes!) 2) food 3) service factor. Although I numbered them these items should be weighted equally. Yes, I like dark beers. (And so should everyone. But that's a different topic;)  There are two very different sections to this restaurant. We sat on the \"sushi/pick-up/to-go\" side in a booth. If you can swing a booth I'd recommend that.  The hostess offered us a round of free drinks if we sat in the main area. (Where the bar is.) I've heard the following from my fella and my brunch friends. (This could be a yay or nay for some, I didn't personally experience.)   The chairs are bolted down to floor and the tables are, perhaps, a bit, on the close side. Sounds like fun for socializing to me! (Or a stretch to have an intimate moment.)  I'm very gung ho to return given how efficiently and seamlessly our order was processed. And (obviously) the food. Even tho the beer menu has recently changed our server* knew her stuff!  My drink of choice was a \"Delux Youngsberry\". This is delightful mix of chocolate stout with framboise. Hoh. So. Good!   On the sushi side there are these hypnotic TVs with an ocean theme. The bummer is all four of them are dedicated to sea worthy endeavors. There are two other TVs to watch sports (but those must be tuned to the same game).  This is a great place for groups of four and under. (I would say the space can't handle more tho.)  * I wish I had written down our server's name. (You'll love her!) Keep an eye out for her / you can't miss her. Pitch black straight hair, slightly longer than chin length with blunt bangs.  She's the bomb!"}
{"text":"Ate there again on Fri night (3/28)... consistently great.    Once again, late night dining in a nice casual hipster environment. Service was great as (almost) always. Food is timely and awesome. Sushi is adequate remembering that they are more a burger place than a hard core sushi place but it was certainly well prepared and taste great.  If they could just do something about the crazy menus..."}
{"text":"Strolled into Delux on a lazy Saturday afternoon around 2pm. The place was mostly empty so we grabbed a quiet corner booth. Loathe as I am to use a word like \"chill\" this place does have a chill vibe, with slate grey booths, whitewashed walls, and ashen hardwood floors. The natural light courtesy the Ossington-facing window does much to illuminate this marvellous but small space. Well placed mirrors don't hurt either.  Service is spot on. We were immediately greeted with menus and gender-coded napkins, and presented with beautiful menus clipped to non-standard sized clipboards. Neat. Only in for an afternoon snack I opted for the most Canadian of snacks from this Cuban-themed menu: donuts and coffee. Bueno. They serve a Cuban brunch on Sundays from 10:30 to 15:00. I shall return for a heartier serving and report back.  Obligatory Title Pun: Power up your DELUX capacitors and travel back to brunch time.  Menu Readability: Revolutionary typeface on natural kraft paper. Drool.  Need to mention: Closed on Mondays.  What this place teaches me about myself: If I owned a time machine, I'd travel back to brunch time."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, eager to please. Overpriced at 11-$12 for a sub-par burger. Fries not included ($5 extra). For a place called Delux Burger we expected the menu to consist mostly of well....burgers. Only 2 choices. The burger itself was flavorless and greasy. The Applewood smoked bacon might as well have been missing as at one point we were both digging through toppings in search of the bacon the menu made us drool over. The cheese was nice and gooey, the arugula was fresh, and the bun was amazing. If the main course wouldn't have left us so disappointed I would have gone back just for the fries."}
{"text":"You can't really say it's the best burger in Phoenix because it's not really a burger, it's a Delux burger which is very different.  The bun is not round, it's like a hoagie roll cut in two.  The cheese is fancy, the veggies are fancy, the meat is medium rare and very tender.  The service is usually pretty good.  Very professional and they're always checking back on you to make sure you have everything you need.  The decor is very hip and modern.  The blue lights are very easy on the eyes.  It's very dimly lit- I almost couldn't see in the bathroom.  They have a pretty decent beer selection.  I tried the Papago Orange Blossom.  Very unique beer that's very smooth and flavorful.  The french fries come in a little shopping cart.  Very cool.  They are flavorful and addictive.  This is a great place."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't updated this review for so long! So I have been to Delux several (and I mean SEVERAL) times since the last review. This place has my favorite burger in town. The Delux burger is crazy delicious. I was a fool to ever order the classic burger. The Delux burger has delicious caramelized onions on it and has bacon in it....yes....in it! I solved the problem of their huge burger sizes by taking half home and having it for lunch the next day (ohhh and it is soooo good the next day too). The sweet potato fries are the way to go here, like I said before, they preserved the flavor of the sweet potato in the fry, which is great because usually that delicious flavor is lost. Also, their fry sauce is excellent...good on the burger and good with the fries (and I'm not usually into mayo at all). The prices are a bit high, but for dinner and lunch the next day (and fries with dinner the next day because I always have to take half of the basket home), it is well worth it. Skip the desserts, though, not the most awesome and you can go get Hava Java next door (much better move for sure)."}
{"text":"Went for a birthday party last night. The only seating they had to accommodate a party of 14 was the tall table in the middle of the restaurant. The stools were very uncomfortable, we ended up getting another table outside for the older & pregnant people.   Luckily I am not drinking (I'm the pregnant person) & was full from lunch. Because it took 15 min at least to get drinks, two different waiters took our order at different times so the food came out separately. I only ordered the miso soup, which was disgusting.. I never knew you could mess up miso soup but you can. I tasted a couple of rolls & they weren't anything special.. But the spider roll was the most horrible tasting roll ever. I swore it was made with rotten crab, another person tried it & felt the same way. Our waiters were scattered.. service was a mess.   I don't recommend this place for a large party"}
{"text":"I thought the burgers here were going to be top-notch. Not the case, as mine was lacking in flavor, Swiss cheese notwithstanding. I only went here once but I don't think I'm coming back."}
{"text":"Maybe you have to come here at night? At lunch it was just OK. The burger was fine bit nothing special and the fries were good. I had heard a ton of hype about this place and it didn't live up to it. In'n'Out for me next time."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Delux since 2005.  My friends and I were drawn there originally by their beer menu and burger.  I am happy to say that 10 years later, I feel the same way as when I first visited.    The Delux Burger is their flagship burger and is wonderful.  You have to try it with a shopping cart of sweet potato fries.  Don't forget to put some of their custom aioli on it.  If you are in the mood for a sweet treat, try one of their awesome deserts or even a milkshake.  Peanut Butter and Chocolate have never tasted so good!"}
{"text":"So, I know I am not the first to review Delux, but it was a pretty good experience, so here I am.  First, let me be honest.  I don't eat red meat.  This makes eating at Delux a little unusual but pleasently enough, not impossible.  I went with my friend (early, because I have seen how busy it gets when I hit up Zen 32).  The decor was super cute (which I find important) and I love that french fries come in a shopping cart.    Anyway, I went because my friend had a major hankering for some of the cupcakes.  I got the turkey burger (because of the no red meat thing) and it was pretty fantastic.  I took off the tomato (I hate them), but they had a cute sign that told the customers why theirs were still safe.  My friend had a burger (of some sort...I didn't pay too much attention...sorry) and she really enjoyed it (although she asked for medium and it was probably medium rare...she couldn't eat the middle).  I am telling you that it is good.  I want to go back for sure.  Oh yeah, one last thing, the burgers are huge!  I couldn't finish mine...but I really did want to..."}
{"text":"Overpriced burger joint.  Nothing too special about his place."}
{"text":"I read about this place in Phoenix magazine where it got an A+!   I didn't know anything else about this place besides the fact that it received an A+ for burgers!  When I saw the restaurant from outside, it looked like a small, hole in the wall place. I saw misters in front of it so it seemed nice.   Once I walked in the place, I was surprised by the decor. It has a retro and trendy look. It has a contemporary feel to it with a mix of the oldies. It looked really small at first. When we took the host that we are a table of three, we looked around and realized there's no where to sit. However, the host led us to the other side which I didn't notice. The other side had booths and it reminded me of a cute little ice cream parlor. I like the furniture and decor.  I decided to order the delux burger since I figure it's probably the burger that received the A+. My burger came out and I took a bite of it. It's definitely juicy but does it deserve an A+? Well, I guess it depends how you're rating it. The meat in it deserves an A+ (I got mine medium rare, delicious and juicy!). Everything else in the burger is nothing out of the ordinary. It had arugula and although I don't like arugula, I think if they put more arugula in there, it'll probably be there. There's also onions and cheese there but could I taste it? Hmmm, they didn't put that much especially with the cheese. There was no cheese. The bread was crispy but also soft, so it wasn't bad. Overall, the burger was juicy and good but it could have used more of the other ingredients in there. I like my burgers to be large, packed with flavors from the meat and other ingredients.   The delux burger actually reminds me a lot of the pork belly sandwich at roli roti except roli roti uses pork and this place uses beef. Similar concept - I think the delux burger combination of ingredients probably works better with pork than beef because I think arugula's bitterness goes well with pork than beef (Maybe that's why there's not that much argula).   We ordered a side of fries (regular and sweet potatoes). They were fresh and crispy, delicious! I love the chipotle aioli with it. It goes well with the sweet potato fries.  I'll probably come back and try the classic burger. The delux burger was just something for me to try once to experience.  Pros: +Juicy meat for the burger +Onions are grilled nicely +Bathrooms are neat looking - very contemporary and the sinks are outside. I like the decor a lot! +Love the casual, contemporary furniture +Open late (yay!)  Cons: - Can't really taste the cheese (it's a plus if you don't like blue cheese because you can't even tell there's blue cheese) - The order of a burger is just a burger, it doesn't come with fries or any other sides. You need to order the sides separately."}
{"text":"There certainly was nothing wrong with my experience here - the service was excellent, the atmosphere is very cool, they have an impressive draft list - but I just don't see what the buzz is about with the food. I am not complaining about it by any means, but it just didn't knock my socks off. Our order included the signature burger, sweet potato fries, and the chicken salad sandwich. The fries were great. The burger was well constructed, though the temperature was a bit over the medium rare that I ordered (this is also how they recommend it). I'm not surprised as the patty was probably only half an inch thick. It was still juicy and the flavor was fine. The chicken salad sandwich was gargantuan, but its contents were a bit lacking of flavor and the chicken was a touch on the dry side.  All in all, it's certainly worth a shot if you've never tried it. I didn't really see the value in it at the moderately high prices so I doubt it will come to mind when deciding on where to eat, but maybe it'll do it for you."}
{"text":"good burgers, fries are served in a tiny shopping cart, optional sweet potatoe fries"}
{"text":"Burger is ok. With all the hype expected more. Fries highlight of the meal tho real good. Still feel that the west valley has a better burger. Sorry east valley. But I would go back again just know now what to expect."}
{"text":"I've always liked Delux Burger. But I LOVED Zen 32. I am so so so glad they started serving the Zen 32 sushi at Delux. I've never been more excited about anything. I've already been a few times and it's just as good... No it's BETTER!   Try the Sweet potato fries with the Aioli sauce. One of the best items on the menu.  Also the Haagen Dazs shakes are yummy as well."}
{"text":"Strolled up to Delux today shortly before 7pm and was pleasantly surprised to see some empty tables on a Friday night. My friend & I decided to forgo the 5 minute wait to sit inside (because I was THAT hungry) and were seated right away on the patio. Yes, it was hot as hell and the misters didn't do much,  but I just needed to be fed ASAP!   I had my usual (Delux burger), my friend had the turkey burger and we shared an order of sweet potato fries. I'm really glad he got the turkey burger because I've always wanted to try it, but was always hesitant to order it in case it sucked. It actually turned out to be really good! I'll probably order it the next time I'm there. And the sweet potato fries are so nice & crispy!!! I almost didn't order them because the past several times (last year) the fries were limp (even when I requested them to be well-done/crispy). I guess they finally got a clue and now I heart their fries.. yummy!   Our waitress, Jessica, was great. She was really helpful, friendly and always made sure our drinks were topped off."}
{"text":"Delux Burger, medium rare + basket of mixed fries (regular and sweet potato) + draft root beer = happy, satiated girl. Delux is like a glam, modern, futuristic Peach Pit. What else can I say?"}
{"text":"service was great. but they had be at GLUTEN FREE BURGER! :)"}
{"text":"I've been to a LOT of sushi bars and restaurants, Delux us truly a cut above the rest.  Fantastic quality, super service and portions beyond other residents in the area.  I HIGHLY recommend to anyone searching for value service and quality.  We're here on our second night in a row!"}
{"text":"Deluxe always has a great vibe. Nothing but friendly staff, and where else can you get a burger and a spicy tuna sushi roll on one plate.  Don't skip the basket of fries......and deserts (root beer float is my favorite) is to die for.  They are open super late (2am) so great late night eats with good music."}
{"text":"Back in the summer, I had a chance to try Delux's Cuban lunch (though I thought of it as more of a brunch!)  We started off with a plate of conch fritters ($8) served with a delicious and addictive mayo-based dip. At first, we were confused because the conch was nowhere to be found. Upon inquiry, we learned that the conch was actually finely diced and incorporated into the batter. On the whole, we really enjoyed the crispy fritters, particularly the doughy texture. I would order this again in a heartbeat.   Couldn't eat at Delux and not try their famous Pressed Cubano ($10).  I haven't had a lot of Cuban sandwiches in my life, but this one was, hands-down, the best I've ever had. I absolutely loved the crunch of the bread and the mustard was awesome! I have nothing but praise!  My friend tried the Cuban Medianoche ($8) with cider cured pork shoulder, ham and gruyere on a fresh baked soft bun. This sandwich was also very enjoyable with a softer overall texture. The gruyere melted beautifully into a gooey mess over the pile of savoury ham.  Another friend also ordered a sandwich with achiote and lime chicken, avocado, tomato, aioli on fresh baked bread ($9). For me, this sandwich, while tasty, was the weakest one of the three. We wished that the bread had been toasted.   All in all, we had a fantastic lunch at Delux. The sandwiches here are wonderful (especially the Pressed Cubano), and I look forward to coming back to try their famous steak frites for dinner!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Delux for years.  Lots and lots of pros.  First, the Chinese Chicken Salad is amazing.  Probably my favorite on the menu.  Secod, the beer selection is great -- they often have Orange Blossom which I really enjoy (it pairs especially nice with the salad!) Third, the basket of French fries are also great - I prefer the mix basket. Finally, they are open late for food!  This is a super pro.  At times I get stuck at work past 10pm and know I can always still get food here."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I just went on 02/11 most recently for my friend's birthday & they gave here a free Ice Cream Sunday which was a nice touch, but I've never ordered anything I haven't liked there.    Their hot dogs are amazing as well as their turkey burgers and their salads.  Their sweet potato fries are to die for yummy and the fries are served in a cute shopping cart.    This place is also open really late so it makes it a great spot to go for the late night munchies or if you just got home on a late flight and are headed back up to the north valley on your way home."}
{"text":"I love this place! Looking for a good late night eat? Come here! I usually get the Delux burger and its best to get it the way its suggested on the menu (med rare).  Their fries (especially the sweet potatoe) are out of this world! They come in a little wire shopping basket on wheels! I have been tempted to take one home with me!           They have a very extensive selections of beer and wine, all sorts of imports are available. This place does fill up fast but will not disappoint the palate!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Been coming here for years. Lenny, is amazing, makes you feel like family! Such a great place to get a late night grub!"}
{"text":"Had dinner today with some friends. Nice intimate place, relaxed vibe. Tables were a little squishy so much so that the dude beside me was cutting into his chicken and a little of the potato flew on to my cell as I was txting a friend. (Txting before dinner started and while my friends were in the bathroom - so I wasnt being rude).  The food was tasty for sure. Oyster platter was nice, though the tiniest little oysters I have ever seen. So I dont think I would have those again.  On of my friends had the pear salad and she said it was good, though she had better... and the portion was small. I had the chicken and it was good, quite tender when chicken breast is usually dry. Good sauce and tangy crispy veggies. Over all pretty good... I thought it was just right, but one of my friends had the same thing and also found the portion too small. But usually thats what you get when places get all fancy pancy. My other friend had the pickerell, I think, the fish dish anyways, and she said it was good, I tried a bit of it and it was definately tastey. Though she also commented that it was about 2 bite fulls and that was it. Dessert we had the coffee creme brule (any kind of coffee dessert I absolutely love! so this did not disappoint) and the donuts. We actually found that the donuts dipped in the creme brule tasted amazing in comparrison to the whipped cream they served with the donuts.  If we had wine and 3 appetizers and 3 desserts instead of 2 each , it would have been kinda pricey for the amount you get. But really, as I said those are how these places work. Even the water glasses are small, the waiter had to come by several times to fill them up and finally he just gave us the bottle of water he served us from. Service was good. Nothing sooo wowow amazing but definately tastey! Definately a good place to go, I would go again. And great place to bring a date. (kind of intimate, but the seating is pretty close to the next table, unless you get a booth) Busy place, but no line up. I would definately reserve. Oh and I wouldnt say this is totally Cuban food. Other places say its French. Maybe its both? Who knows. I would say a 3.5 out of 5 but they dont have that option."}
{"text":"So you're out with friends. One of you is craving sushi. The other wants a juicy burger. Look no further than Delux. This trendy centrally located restaurant has delicious grass-fed burgers and a halfway decent wine list. I've never had their sushi so I couldn't verify how it is, but seeing it come out of the kitchen it looks pretty good. This place is tiny so it can get loud but on the bright side it's open until 2am. Not super kid friendly."}
{"text":"Always like eating at Delux and Revo Burrito....  Healthy food and it doesn't hurt that they belong to Idine so I get reward points every time I eat there."}
{"text":"Have not been here in many years. Still makes a very good burger and excellent fries. They have also Incorporated Zen 32 which was in the same shopping center owned by the same owner which does sushi. A little strange to have a burger sushi place but it is somewhat separated. Food and service are good. They pour a nice stiff drinks as well as have a good amount of craft beer on tap. Worth checking out if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Burgers were amazing!! Love the fact that I can have sushi too! The shopping cart full of French fries was adorable plus they were crispy and delicious! Can't get enough of the sauce! Service was awesome, very on top of drinks and attentive without smothering. The desert blossom iced tea is great, one of my favorites!! The bread with the oil & vinegar was very yummy, great starter. The building was a little cold is my only complaint but I just wore my jacket so all was good."}
{"text":"I had been here once before and had a burger with a fun fry \"grocery cart\" and a beer, which was good, but when one of my attendings brought us back here for sushi, I was incredibly impressed.  Who knew that a burger joint would also have the best sushi in Phoenix?  We chose several of the happy hour rolls, keeping the selections simple (for example, salmon rolls and spicy tuna, without the usual fancy additives).  The rolls contain a large amount of fish and very little rice, really highlighting the flavor of the buttery fish.  Delicious.  We also had some sashimi which was spectacular.  Even better - if you ask for it, the chef will chop up some REAL wasabi.  I didn't even know that the wasabi I ate at other restaurants wasn't real wasabi, but apparently real wasabi looks like a green salsa and has an incredible taste.  Way worth the extra $2.  Try some warm saki while you're at it!  We're excited to bring back friends to what is apparently one of the only places in Phoenix where you can get true unadulterated wasabi without the horseradish."}
{"text":"Two words: \"Yasss Queen!\" This place is delicious, quick, amazing and friendly!!! Alisha was our server and she provided one of my best resteraunt experiences in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"A few of my favorite things about Delux: -It's open LATE (2am every single night) -SWEET POTATO FRIES!  They are nice and crispy.  I always order the mixed fries (regular and sweet potato mixed together and served in a mini shopping cart) -The blue lighting (under the table and around the small restaurant/bar) which gives the whole place a soothing, yet vibrant blue glow. -Wide selection of Martinis (I would love it more if they weren't at least $11 each, but that's definitely standard for a specialty martini). -Bar setting without carding at the door (then no one gets excluded from delicious food just because they aren't old enough to drink). -Dessert: Mmmm Chocolate  Delux is one of my favorite places to take someone when I want to hop out of the ASU Tempe area (over to Phoenix), but don't want to go too far.   I love the long, slightly higher table with stools (but not as high as a high top) that runs down the center of Delux.  It's always fun to sit next to interesting people and strike up (even brief) conversations as you wait for your food.  The bathrooms are two dark individual rooms (both unisex) with a sink and vanity area between them.  They have bead curtains around the urinals which was a nice was to add some glitz."}
{"text":"People keep saying how this place has the best burgers. Well not so for veggie burgers. Seriously, Denny's veggie burger is better. The patty was dry bland mush."}
{"text":"Turkey burger. Best anywhere. I've been going here for years. Whenever I am in the area, I have to eat there. The 2 go take out service is really good but for some reason the wait staff, not so much. Still hands down, one of my fave places to go for a burger and fries. This is NOT In n Out! MMMM!"}
{"text":"I'm SINCERELY blown away by the negative reviews about their Delux burgers. My boyfriend and I would come here at least once or twice a month when we lived downtown solely for burgers.    Seriously, these burgers are the bomb.com  - Juicy, flavorful, not piled 2' high with useless veggies that take away from or try to mask the flavor of the meat itself. The bread is soft and helps in absorbing the juices from the burger. They have this amazing spicy aioli that comes with the fries and I usually spread that on the bun for a little extra kick.   Since moving 15 min outside of downtown we don't frequent Delux as much as we would like, but we did make it down last night for a late dinner.   Managers - your new bartender is the SWEETEST. I ordered an annoyingly complicated (I know this. I manage a restaurant. I judge myself for ordering it. Every time.) Manhattan. It came out wrong the first time, but the server took it back and had the bar remake it. The bartender ( didnt catch her name but short with shorter dark hair ) delivered it the second time, made sure I was happy with it and asked me to taste it before she left to make sure it was perfect. Such a sincere extra step to insure customer satisfaction. Muffin.    Anyway - Delux, keep doin' what you're doin! Don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Good Turkey Burger, Excellent Fries, Pricey But High Quality Ingredients  I went here last week on the sincere recommendation of a friend who loves turkey burgers (doesn't eat beef or pork). Of course, I tried the turkey burger.   I arrived after the lunch hour, so the restaurant was not crowded. I was immediately seated provided a menu, and offered a beverage. Service remained excellent throughout my visit.   The menu offered many attractive options, but since my mind was already made up, I ordered the Turkey Burger. As an afterthought, I also ordered a half order of regular fries (they also offer sweet potato), which my friend had said were delicious.   Fairly quickly, my server brought me my fries, and told me that my turkey burger would be up shortly. This would have been a problem if I had wanted the fries in tandem with my burger. Here is a tip - if you want burger and fries together, tell them when you order. I noticed that the other diners also received their fries prior to their entrees - like an appetizer. I was hungry, and didn't mind the delivery of the fries first. They were hot, thin, very crisp, perfectly lightly salted, sprinkled with parsley, and served with amazing catsup and delicious spicy aioli for dipping. Yum. These are a must have.  At about the perfect moment, my Turkey Burger arrived. All-natural, extra-lean ground turkey breast served on a toasted wheat bun with red leaf lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, and sides of pico de gallo and fat free garlic & cilantro aioli. Per my friend's recommendation, I added the sides to my turkey burger. The only problem with this burger was that it was too thick (even with squeezing) to get into my mouth for a complete bite of everything. I did my best, but I really hope that no one was watching me. I would have liked my turkey burger a touch less lean, but the sides, avocado and tomatoes added moisture and fat that was much needed.  The portions were generous, and had I not been so hungry, I'm sure that I would have taken half of my burger home. As it ended up, I abandoned half of the bun. I didn't notice initially, but I could have had a lettuce wrap instead of the bun. That is what I will do next time.   Yes, next time. There are great burger, salad, and sandwich options, in addition to sushi after 4pm, and daily soup specials.   This was not an inexpensive place to dine, but the quality and service were worth it. For their burgers, they use Niman Ranch beef and other high quality ingredients. They also have a full bar, and extensive beer and drink menu. Seating was tight, so I will likely go back during their off peak hours again."}
{"text":"We came in tonight around 530, they were pretty full but were seated right away. We sat in Jacquelines station and she got our drinks right away and Mom ordered a beet salad that was very, very good. Lots of beet strings and candied pecans. The dressing was a tad heavy and blue cheese was powerful but that salad was awesome nonetheless. I had the Delux burger with caramelized onions, cheese, arugula and perfectly cooked patty on a roll. I thought it was fantastic. We got the mixed fries on the side and it was a healthy portion with a fry sauce and ketchup on the side. Service was great, food was great....what more can you ask for? I can't believe it's my 1st time here but definitely not my last."}
{"text":"This place serves the best burger I have ever had. It's a hip joint with a great menu and amazing quality food. No weaknesses.  Go for the Delux Burger with sweet taters (and extra helpings of aioli)."}
{"text":"Nice concept which has been around forever. Solid burger & bar. Open late which is rare. This restaurant operator has a knack for being ahead of the fad curves (sushi, burgers, burritos). Can't miss"}
{"text":"This is a solid 4-star joint. Based on the food and beer selection alone. The burgers are really, really good. It's a well seasoned and dressed with caramelized onions and arugula on a ciabatta or brioche type roll....And the gazpacho - this is one of the valley's best gazpacho's.  Considering there are 130+ reviews on this place - it strikes me odd to not see any comments about their seating and ambiance. Delux is little. At one point, they seemed to have realized how great they were doing, and smooshed every possible table,booth and chair together to try and squeeze every last possible patron.  D's ToGo (next door) is a great concept, but it seems that space could be programmed better. Utilize curbside or call ahead pickup instead of cramming us in the main area like sardines.  And although trendy and stylish, if this were anything but \"Delux\", we would all be yelping about their shameless exaggeration of their logo and branding. Just take a look at how many Ds you see floating around the restaurant...We get it - we're at Delux, eating Delux burgers, going to Delux bathrooms, ordering Delux beer, wiping our asses with Delux toilet paper.  It's a FUN place with GREAT beer, though.... Remember that!  Oh yea, their fries are good. Not great. And a bit overpriced... And so many people have sweet potato fries now, I wouldn't be surprised if I saw something new starting to accompany the burgers...."}
{"text":"4 and a half, really!    Burgers are great!  One of the few places that will give you a medium rare burger without hasseling you.  I love my burgers medium rare and juicy!  The the sweet potato fries, too!  I really want to try the chicken panini and the grilled cheese, but I just can't stop eating my fave burger, the standard.  The ultimate is the chocolate malt, made with chocolate ice cream instead of vanilla ice cream with choclate syrup added...there is a difference.  Great after a hang over or on a date, guys dig burgers."}
{"text":"Modern, \"yuppie\" atmosphere but the food is consistently good, and the craft beer selection is among the very best in Phoenix.  Open late.  Service is usually good.  Clean restrooms too, which seems to be the exception to the norm in Phoenix.  Highly recommend sweet potato fries.  I prefer weeknights early in the week to avoid the crowd."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I was really excited about this place. If you look at my other reviews you'll see that I'm not a particularly picky person but this really was just an ok experience. The regular fries were seriously no better than fast food. The burger was decent and cooked to medium well as requested but it really just wasn't anything special. We were there during happy hour and draft beer is a dollar off. That's good because draft beer prices are on the high side. For the two of us with one beer each the meal was fifty dollars (that's after the 7% Yelp cashback). I really wanted more out of it than this."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST place to go for anything!! Classy night with friends? Delux! Relaxed high-end date? Delux!  This is one of a few reviews I do and I'm making this one because ever since I went I just want to go over and over. Their signature \"a la cart\" fries are si okay amazing, you have to order them if you go! Sushi is definitely a must also not to mention their burgers. Bucket list (or routine) restaurant MUST. service is great too, all servers are happy and helpful."}
{"text":"Get the mixed sweet/regular fries basket and a rootbeer.... ahhhhh awesome! The Delix burger burger is different but awesome, fresh and the bread is really good too. We tried the Vegas sushi roll and that was really good as well!"}
{"text":"Delux is a real boon to the Biltmore/Arcadia area and is probably one of the few good restaurants open in Phoenix until to 2 AM. The place does fill up fast, so I prefer to go there on off-hours, especially during the reverse happy hour. The bartenders are very friendly.  The burgers are large and tasty. The fries are some of the best I have ever had. The bar is well-stocked with a large variety of beers, wines, and spirits. I tried a hot dog at Delux once and thought it was good, but I suggest sticking with the burger and fries."}
{"text":"Meh - Honestly I've had better. I read and heard so many raving reviews about this place that I just \"had\" to try it. Both my boyfriend and I weren't overly impressed by anything. Fez is 10 times better in my books. Same general location, so if I'm ever in the neighborhood and want a burger, it won't be Delux.  I ordered their Delux burger, and my boyfriend got their All American Burger.  The meat was good, but nothing to write home about. The garlic sauce they serve with their fries is pretty tasty, but way too heavy on the mayo side. The fries weren't that spectacular, and were pretty gross after they lost their warmth. We didn't go after the sweet potato fries, so maybe that's what we were missing (??) The salad the lady had on the table next to us looked pretty good. Big portions. I dunno, still not sold.  Needless to say, I ended up trashing my left-overs. I guess these are the kinds of things that happen when you find over rated restaurants. You'll find me at Fez."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite burger in Phoenix! Great fries, fun atmosphere. Love the late night menu and service is usually great."}
{"text":"If you are new in town or your first time here and you could only pick one thing to try, the Delux Burger is a must!  Cooks are excellent, quick, and consistent...the waiters not so much, they are very friendly but often forgetful and slow for simple requests.  Sushi is also probably the best I've had (although the portions are much smaller than they used to be but still the pretty high price) if it's packed you may not want to get sushi though the wait for sushi is often VERY long I'd say 75% of the time. I do remember one time I came and only ordered sushi, the rest of the table had already ordered, received, and finished their meals before I ever got my Sushi rolls this was the second time this had happened.  Overall though it's the quality of the ingredients and how they are combined that trumps the wait and makes everything here delicious and keeps us coming back no matter what.  Only docked the star for the speed and quality of service, the food otherwise is excellent, I only wish they had a westside location so we can go more often!"}
{"text":"Ahh, so much hype and rave and I can finally throw in my 2 cents.  I am purely reviewing just the burger and fries.  The patty was prepared nicely in it's medium rare form.  But I felt like there was not enough beefy flavor to it.  Maybe the caramelized onions and applewood bacon took that away?? Not to mention the fancy arugula green leaves.  The final piece to this atypical style was that it came in a demi-baguette roll.  All of these supporting cast ingredients to the patty tasted fine and complemented each other but overall the final product steered away from the American classic style.  The only thing I remotely liked about the fries were that it was lightly seasoned with salt and little herbs and the fact that it came out in a little shopping cart with the Delux logo in front of it.  I would rate them as mediocre.  It just did not pop.  I was hoping for the potato fresh taste in the inside and crispiness on the out. [Regular Fries]  As for the decor, it's a nice, clean contemporary and young professional lunch spot."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a friend. I had heard from multiple people about the place so I had high expectations. I ordered a cheeseburger lettuce wrapped (being gluten-free for awhile). The burgers were out of this world as were the sweet potato fries. The servers are always first-rate!"}
{"text":"A solid burger and fries. I ordered the Delux burger; Adam ordered his normal, Delux Chicken Salad. We split the mixed fries.  The burger was cooked nicely, although I think it was more medium than medium rare. Whatever. It tasted great. The bacon was my favorite layer of it, obs. Eating a rectangle burger was a fun twist, too, as I've almost always eaten round burgers. It was also the perfect portion to fill me up without busting my gut.  Now, I'm not a fan of shoestring fries. They've always seems to delicate and skimpy for me. But the sweet potato fries were excellent, dipped in the garlic aioli.  The décor is pleasant and at 7:30 on a Thursday night there wasn't a crowd. But there was a drunk dude at the bar area who thought he has something important to say."}
{"text":"Believe the hype! Great food and service. So nice that they're open late - it's always a struggle to find GOOD food spots to hit up late night and now I've found one!  Came on a Friday night and sat on the sushi side which was a bit quieter than the other burger side with the bar. Waiter was super attentive and chatty, which I love :) He gave us lots of recommendations. I took a risk and tried the Delux sushi roll even though I don't usually go for raw fish (well, seared salmon is still raw to me). It was soooo good! Perfect amount of spice and so much flavor. I can't wait to go back just to get it again.   They offer reverse happy hour and lots of drink/food specials. Seem like they have a great dessert menu-- although the apple pie that's posted in one of the pictures here on Yelp is no longer being served. So don't get your hopes up on that because I was pretty bummed! They do have lots of other dessert options. Be sure to try the mix of regular and sweet potato fries!"}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just thinking about the yummy food that we have eaten here.  The sweet-potato fries here are the best ones we've ever had ANYWHERE!  The burgers are ALWAYS cooked to perfection no matter how we order them (I prefer well-done burgers, and my hubby likes them medium with pink in the middle).  The Chinese Chicken salad here (idk if thats what it's actually called, but thats what we call it) is the best ever (ok, it ties with the one at Houstons, but it is a salad that I actually ENJOY eating...and I would normally rather starve than eat a salad).  On the weekends it usually pretty busy and hectic, but it is soooo worth it! Also great for those late-night burger cravings."}
{"text":"I wasn't all that impressed with Delux like so many other people have been.  The place is a tad over-trendy for my taste, and rather cramped.  I also don't like the condescending attitudes of the staff.    The food here is decent though.  I wasn't amazed by it, but rather let down considering all the hype I had heard.  The burger was cooked the way I asked for it, medium, and was quite flavorful and juicy.  The whole burger experience was just not as stellar as I had hoped.  I do love how they serve their fries in the shopping carts.  I had to resist the urge to steal them, but I did notice that they had them for sale.  The sweet potato fries are pretty good, but pale in comparison to the amazing sweet potato fries at FEZ.  The regular fries aren't bad either.  The presentation of the food here is quite nice, and I give them props for that.   I've been here a couple times, but I'm just less than impressed.  I probably won't be back because it isn't close enough to go often and it isn't good enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"One of the top 4 places in Phoenix to get a burger. Try the Delux Burger with the Baugette Bun which is awesome. If you like sweet potato fries this is the place to get them. This place is always busy for a reason with high quality ingredients and fast service. Great central location and is open till 2:00 am"}
{"text":"Really good but I have to penalize it for its over-priced cupcakes.  The red velvet cupcake is divine but at $3.50 I just have to shake my head and think, what is this world coming to... the mark-up has got to be about 1000%.  Am I wearing a sign that says \"sucker\"?  I read about a cool bakery in NYC that sells award winning red velvet cupcakes and they charge $3.00.  In NYC!  This is not NYC.  It's Phoenix.  Come on.  And $6.00 for a hot dog?  Granted, it is a Neiman Ranch hot dog, but it is to go.  I think you can buy a whole package of Neiman Ranch hot dogs at Trader Joe's for $6.00.  That being said, I probably will fall prey to the red velvet again.  As you leave Delux, you can see them in the window of To Go, beckoning like a siren.  Glorious and succulent looking.  Genius."}
{"text":"Burgers are amazing and sushi was great.  Wasnt a huge fan of the lollipop (because they literally are like huge lollipops of sushi wrapped in cucumber).  But the other sushi was really good.  2 smaller burgers to share was just right for a couple (doing sushi also)."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the cute shopping cart of fries, they'd get a one star. Went in an hour after they opened today so it wasn't busy at all. All the servers and host were standing around looking bored out of their mind. My server was nowhere to be found so I waved down a server that was standing right next to me with nothing to do, he shook his head at me and replied \"I'm not your server,\" and went back to staring at the damn ceiling before asking if he could help me with anything. I couldn't read his name tag but I think his name was Ali or ali-something. Finally my server showed up after a few minutes and took my order. If it wasn't for my friend wanting to try this \"popular\" place, I would had walked out of there. Overall, service was below a one star.  As for the food, I got the delux burger since it was their popular item with an order of sweet potato fries. I ordered the burger medium well and it came out way over cooked. It was extremely bland, I had to add a lot of salt and pepper just to finish half of the burger. Oh, the BACON was nowhere to be found in my burger. Over $10 for this dinky tasteless burger? I rather go to in-n-out. The fries was okay since the sauce was good. My friend got the chicken panini sandwich, which she said was nothing special. With that price, you could've gotten much better for less elsewhere.   Overall, we're never coming back."}
{"text":"Delux, what did you do to yourself? you get all these awesome reviews and then you let you asshole fall out.   the first two times i ate here pretty close to just after you opened i had great food and good service. the grilled cheese was awesome and your burgers too..the fries were good, especially the sweet potato ones.   the last 3 times i visited your bosom, i was turned away by the uppity, unintelligent service staff and the lack luster food. did i miss something? do you just not care about your appearance anymore? have you been turned out so long you are a used up toothless whore now? i think so. sorry honey, I've found some new piece of ass.   keep on strolling.  Yelp."}
{"text":"We were SO hung over from visiting a friend in Scottsdale last week and he recommended a nice burger from Delux.    We met up with him and the place was pretty cool looking.  We sat at the long row table which I would have rather sat down in a chair or booth since I could feel the alcohol seeping from my skin.    I really wanted to curl up in a ball and die but needed some food first.   We were starving and got the delux burger with mix of sweet potato fries (served in a cute cart!).  None of us could finish the burger it was so filling and delicious!  I also had the gaspacho soup which was refreshing to begin with.   I didn't give this five stars though because the atmosphere to me wasn't very comfortable and a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Holy molyyyyy this place is my jam! First off, I loooveeee sushi. Like, I would marry sushi if I could. But, my boyfriend? Not a fan of raw fish. So we always have an issue when I want to get my sushi fix. Delux is the perfect place for us! It's a sushi and burger bar rolled into one heavenly place.   So, on to the food. I've had all of the low carb rolls, the sashimi, nigiri, and a few of the hand rolls. Verdict? Fresh fresh fresh!!!!!!! And the best part, HAPPY HOUR! They have some great deals!  My boyfriend is obsessed with their hamburgers and fries. Every time I suggest Delux he says HECK YEAH!  Honestly, I am a total sushi snob but this place gets 10 stars. New favorite spot."}
