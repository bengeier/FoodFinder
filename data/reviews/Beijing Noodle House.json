{"text":"I ate here with some friends on February 2, 2017. We ordered the pig intestines and they had a foul smell like they weren't cleaned before preparing them. We told the server and they said they were fine. We did not eat them. We also ordered the stir fry lamb chops and they weren't much better. The flavor and odor were no good.  We then ordered the beef cho fan and the beef had the texture of rubber and was very hard to eat. The server wasn't very accommodating to our complaints. My friends and I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"The food here is just fantastic. I've been here twice so far. The first time I had to try the noodles, of course, because their homemade right there. I got the beef chao fun, and the beef was just so tender I had to try the orange beef this time (I love orange beef) and it was no less amazing this time. 

This place is so underrated. If you are looking for a great, new place to try, you really should try this place. The waiter is so friendly, and the atmosphere is so home-like. 

I'm telling you, it is worth trying. Really worth it."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! Wow!  I live I in Gilbert and stopped by this place on my way home from work on a recommendation from a friend.  I was very amazed at the incredibly delicious complex flavors. ... I'm not Chinese but I certainly know good food considering myself a quasi foodie. This is fresh delicious food that will entertain the most distinguished palettes. I have ordered thus far. .. potstickers (the best I've had) 
Hong Kong fried rice, beef soup with handmade noodles and braised pork noodles.  Don't let the menu names or regional food selection distract you from the amazing flavors of this incredible cuisine.  Highly recommended that you try this great place.  Go hungry!"}
{"text":"???? ?????? ?????? ???????? ???? ???
has the best Chinese food ever!  They use white meat for their chicken dishes which is fatless and juicy.  Their service is quick and comfortable.  Simply wonderful! 

Eating here right now for the 26th time. This place is awesome. Great food and great service! You are crazy to think other wise!"}
{"text":"The food is great and they have good service. I will be back again soon to try more of their dishes!"}
{"text":"It deserves a 5 star since the master chef was from a famous restaurant in China. His skill is probably the best in Phoenix.
The reason I took away one star was because:
1. Master chef was not cooking on that day, therefore his wife was making the meal. Her skill is not that good. I can give no more than 3 star to her.
2. May be the master chef can show his wife some cooking skills. It helps a lot when the master chef is not around.

That is why I took away one star."}
{"text":"Menu has a lot of choices including authentic selections. Service was prompt until we were served our food then we ran out of soda, we were done with our meals and wanted to leave. There was only one waitress serving the lunch crowd. She never came to check on us and we had to flag her down after sitting for nearly 20 min after our meal. She was in the back a lot and would not look in our direction once our meal was served. Not sure if we will come back."}
{"text":"Great food.  Sitting here watching people pick up at Burger King drive thru --- they don't realize what they are missing!  Very authentic food."}
{"text":"I have been coming here awhile and the food is pretty Dame good, very consistent. Noodles are awesome and dumping are handmade."}
{"text":"It is with a heavy heart that I say my last couple visits here via take-out have not gone well in terms of food quality. I ordered General Tso's chicken with Hot and Sour Soup and picked it up and drove home as I normally do. When I started to eat the soup it was warm but not hot. The soup was really bad. It had a thick consistency to it almost like it had been sitting for a little too long and it tasted so bad that I threw it out after one or two sips. The General Tso's chicken was acceptable but there seems to be some issues in consistency with this food item, they make it slightly different every single time and the sauce was very watery this time around which wasn't that great. The fried-rice tasted a little stale as well. It was not a very enjoyable experience this last time around. 

I have noticed the following since my first visit-
- The ground is sticky
- Doesn't seem like that much cleaning goes on here/not really in-depth cleaning
- Strange smell inside of restuarant
- The front doors could probably use a door professional to make it so they are even and open easier (this is a minimal complaint/professionalism complaint)
- Quality of food has steadily gone down"}
{"text":"The food is great, that's the only good thing I can say about this place. The service was horrible. The waitress was slow, barely spoke English, and was rude when asked questions. They also don't serve beer like most of the restaurants in this area. Get your food to go, or skip this place."}
{"text":"Very authentic, delicious handmade noodles and dumplings. We ordered way too much food but we're looking forward these leftovers!"}
{"text":"Came in a little over an hour before closing. Other people were just finishing up their dinner, but we weren't rushed or treated as a burden. We ordered the Teriyaki chicken combo and Chicken Chow Mein combo. The soups that came with them were piping hot. Always a good sign, especially so close to closing. The teriyaki chicken was delicious and beautiful to look at, though a little salty, but overall the best I've had in a while. The Chow Mein was also delicious, but not as flavorful as I'd hoped. I usually pass on the fried rice, but the rice here wasn't greasy and looked healthy even. Everything did! I also noticed how the sweet and sour sauce actually tasted like sauce and not like some sugar syrup.

Now here's where things were a little iffy. The server was polite and respectful, but oddly cold. Wasn't like he didn't want to be there, he was just distant. Also, when we sat down, there were chopsticks, but he replaced them with silverware without asking. What if I had wanted those? How could he know whether or not I could use them? Also, traffic started picking up, and when a group of Caucasian people came, it was like he was more animated with them. He even stuck around to explain the menu to them even though a few of them said they had eaten there before; this was our first time but we didn't get that same treatment. Now, I'm not one to play the race card, but no matter how much I tried to reason with myself, it just didn't feel right. 

In short, the food was good, but the customer service could've been better. Don't know if I'll come back; I'd rather find a place were I feel like the server wants to take my order, not that they HAVE to."}
{"text":"Great place, the tender noodle is amazing so is the spicy and sour noodle, dumpling is great, will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"I came from Scottsdale to enjoy the food here. It's hard to find good, authentic Chinese food in the area, but now I have a new favorite place. Had the Mongolian beef, specialty dumplings, and a taro Boba tea. Food was not salty or greasy like most places, and the service was fast and friendly. They make their own noodles and dumplings, and it definitely has that comforting homecooked feel and taste. And let's be honest, when the staff and majority of the patrons are of the same ethnicity as the food they serve, you know it has to be great. Will definitely make this my go to place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place is perfect for those looking for AUTHENTIC Chinese food. Having grown up in a Chinese family, I missed the dishes that my mom and dad made which you don't see at PF Chang's or your average dim sum restaurant.  But I found them here.

The first time we went, we ordered some Dan Dan Noodles, a beef rice-noodle dish, some green onion pancakes, and some of the house dumplings. The dumplings were the star, with fresh homemade wrappers.

The staff was very friendly and non-judgemental. Feel free to ask more about the dish."}
{"text":"Was excited to try a noodle house,  but did not enjoy the experience.  There was a dust film was over windows.  Dingy. Dirty.  Unsanitary.  Ordered orange chicken egg drop soup. We ate it but not savoring and was not determined to eat leftovers.  Tea was also watered down."}
{"text":"Noodles are really good.  We had the won ton noodle soup, the won ton is delicious.  The scallion pancakes are thick and yummy! not greasy.  The leak and eggs bun are excellent, very juicy.  You can tell the wrapper is homemade, super thin.  Dan Dan noodles has nice texture and flavor."}
{"text":"One of our favorite Chinese restaurants. Singapore noodles and dumplings are great! Also boba milk. We have tried fried rice which is also good. Chilli chicken is good but bit too spicy. Run by a nice family. Low to Average on ambience but food seems to be authentic. I see Chinese folks eating here, so my guess may be right."}
{"text":"Friendly service, diverse selection of items on their menu, good prices, and delicious food! 

We ordered an assortment of different things from their dinner menu. Our only qualm was just how long it took to get our food after we ordered. We waited over a half hour. I understand it is a sit-down restaurant, but we were surprised it took so long to get our food. We will be coming back, but next time, we will order ahead of time and pick it up since it took so long."}
{"text":"Some of the best noodles/Chinese food I have ever had. Huge portions,great prices but above all it tastes amazing. Staff was very friendly,food was super fresh and piping hot. I look forward to trying something new next time. This time it was braised pork noodles, leak pancakes and orange chicken between my boyfriend and I."}
{"text":"I'm pretty adventurous when it comes to food, and mom and pop ethnic places are my favorite places to try.  Language barriers make some people nervous, not me.  Even if your English is minimal, we can get through ordering food.  Not so much here.  Not only was the menu incomprehensible, the poor waiter was completely unable to assist.  We ended up with some seriously bizarre items.  The dumplings were good, as was the fried rice (although it was unlike any fried rice I've ever had, which may be why I liked it because I generally don't).  The fried noodles my husband ordered were like birds nests of uncooked ramen, inedible, although the sauce was pretty good.  My dan dan noodles were too hot to eat after one or two bites, so I ended up with his crunchy noodles.  We had a hard time getting our drinks refilled.  It was just not a good experience."}
{"text":"First off I don't get why this place has high ratings?! I walked in and it was so dead! No one but their kids on the tablets at the tables. I ordered food to go and I wanted BBQ pork buns but instead I got some nasty pork with scallions instead! Absolutely gross. I won't be returning here."}
{"text":"I got the braised beef noodle soup and it totally hit the spot! Their noodles are hand drawn and cooked perfectly with the right amount of chewiness. The broth was very flavorful and paired well with the bok choy and other added ingredients. I met the family of the business and they are the nicest people! I definitely recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"Went there at 7:30 pm Monday night but they were close despite the signs say they open till 9 pm."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch based on Yelp reviews.   We were not disappointed!

Very good lunch specials with great value for the price.   The orange chicken was excellent.

We shall return!"}
{"text":"Excellent pot stickers and dumplings.  Legit Beijing-style food.  Love the Wonton Soup and Dan Dan Noodles too.  Most authentic Chinese food in the valley."}
{"text":"We flew in on Christmas Day and needed food before our journey was done. My wife found this place and we decided to check it out. 
Wonton Soup: bland , wontons hard, a little piece of bok choy. Fair at best

Scallion pancake : floury not cooked well. 

Orange chicken : so over battered and greasy , rice was dry and horribly seasoned 

Cashew shrimp  : just ok not great"}
{"text":"We came in on a Saturday afternoon and we we're the only people in the restaurant. Somehow service was still slow and the waitress kept forgetting our drinks. There were also long stretches of time with no refills until we asked. I don't think it helped that she was napping in one of the booths when not at our table. There was definitely a language barrier.

The facilities were ok. No flowers like it shows in the photos, maybe that was a special event.  The furniture was new, but looking at the restroom, it does not look like they clean it everyday. Eww.

I was disappointed that the first two items I ordered we're not available. 3rd time is the charm! 
The food was good.  Everyone at our table was impressed. 

I would definitely recommend this place for take-out!"}
{"text":"Great food, really good dumplings! Service is normally good, but recently I was there on a Saturday night and it was packed and still only 1 server - I didn't get anything I needed like refills or sauce and it took forever to get the check - I really like the food though"}
{"text":"Large portions,tasty food and very good customer service! It was our 1st time here and we will definitely be back!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Thank you for being open on Christmas and for serving us an unforgettable meal! A bunch of us gathered here, ordered lots of dishes and passed them around on the lazy Susan. The highlights were the dumplings (of course), crispy eggplant, dan dan noodles and bok choy. Some adventurous friends had fun ordering jellyfish and pig intestine (much like calamari, they said.) The scallion pancakes were also delicious and we left feeling very full and happy. Merry Christmas!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places for authentic Chinese food. They also have a good selection of the Americanized versions as well. The restaurant is pretty big inside and the menu is even bigger.

These are the same great people that ran the Kong Fu Gyoza restaurant in the Mekong food court. I wasn't sure until my curiosity made me ask one of the employees. She said yes and called the chef out of the kitchen. He was the same dude and was happy to give me a quick howdy. He told me that he would cook me whatever I wanted. Even some of his items from their last resturant. Sweet!

Ordered the Pot Stickers and the Cumin Lamb on my first visit. The Cumin Lamb was so good and just melted in my mouth. It had just the right amount of heat and the perfect combination of flavors. The Pot Stickers were also good and I covered them with their homemade chili oil and some Chinese vinegar.

Next time tried out a Noodles dish with Shrimp, Pork, Mushrooms in a thick gravy and a Seafood Wonton Soup later in the week. The soup was a little on the small side but very tasty!

The menu is just too big to cover everything in this review. Appetizers, Soup, Fried Rice, Rice Soup, Combination plates, Chef's Specials, Entries, homemade Noodle dishes, homemade Dumplings, homemade Buns and so forth and so on.

Can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu. Everything is fresh and served rather quickly. They also have several Chinese items that are not on the handout menu. Instead they are hanging on the wall and not translated into English.

Service is friendly and very helpful. There can be a small language barrier when ordering. Just ask the same question a few different ways to make sure that you both are in sync.

Definitely like what they are doing here and the food is really delicious. I'm going to step out on a limb and give them a big 5 thumbs up. I'm getting hungry just thinking about the place. 

Please give them a visit and help keep their doors open. A large amount of the ASU Chinese students go back home in the summertime and it's a little slow right now. MARK LIKES HIS CHICKEN SPICY!

5 STARS"}
{"text":"Incredible Chinese food in, of all places, Mesa, Arizona. We had the chicken dumplings, Dan Dan noodles and Orange Chicken lunch combo (for the kids) along with Strawberry shake and sweet soy milk. All were great. The dumplings and noodles were some of the best, most authentic (to this Arizonan's limited experience) I've had. 

We came during lunch time on a Saturday and were the only non-Asians in the place (a sign this is a legit Asian restaurant). If you go, go authentic."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time. Tried their house fried rice and H25 noodles. The serving sizes were great! Enough for two people to share. Their prices are reasonable and we didn't wait long for our food to come. When the food arrived it was super hot and fresh! Not like other places where you can tell your foods been sitting there for a while. I have no complaints for the food quality! It's an amazing place with great authentic taste! 

I'd have to say this place is perfect except for one thing. We had help from two of their servers and both didn't know what their menu items had as far as vegetables or meats. There was definitely a communication barrier. The serves didn't really understand English which made it hard to ask question and get correct answers. For example: we asked for orange soda and when we got our soda it tasted like ginger ale. When we tried telling them it must've ran out the server had no idea what we were saying and instead to make it easier for him we ordered a different drink. 

Overall this place still earned my Five Star Rating!"}
{"text":"Greasy.  They misunderstood me when I ordered--ordered chicken skewers and got fried chicken wings with no flavor or sauce, ordered spring rolls and got fried veggie rolls. Over priced. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"When people ask me for a list of restaurants serving authentic Chinese cuisine in the Valley, I give them a very short list and this restaurant is in that list. Not many Chinese restaurants in this region would serve dishes like black fungus (wood ear mushrooms) and scallions, or cold spicy beef tongue laden with Sichuan peppercorns. Of course they also serve familiar dishes like sesame chicken or orange beef and those are good choices here as well. But for an establishment like this, I suggest that you try to make the most of your visit -- be a bit adventurous and try something out of the ordinary. You'll probably discover culinary gems that will become your new favorites! Everything I have ordered here has been delicious, prices are easy on the pocketbook, the service has always been efficient if just a tad impersonal, the restaurant is spacious, the location is convenient (on Country Club Dr. in Mesa close to I-60) and parking is never a problem."}
{"text":"This place has the best best best beef noodle ???? and Dan Dan noodles and cold and spicy noodles and dumplings! I found the place on Yelp and I suggested it to my family. We decided to meet here for dinner one Monday night. When we arrived outside the parking lot there was no car or customer. So they asked me again are you sure you want to eat here? Yes I said. The best gambler I was to brave it and now you know how good it is. 

I have returned 4 times in a month. My husband got to go last week while I was sick. It's noodles it's my comfort food.

The owner is also the server during the week she may not be the most friendly staff but come here for the bomb noodles"}
{"text":"Hidden gem!  The 5 stars is really based on how delicious their lamb noodle soup is but everything else is still 3-4 stars.  Come here for good traditional Chinese noodle soups and dumplings but definitely not ambiance.  Family owned and owner runs the whole place with little help up front.  They make their own noodles and they are fantastic!  They are slippery and delectable and the best homemade noodles I've had in AZ. The lamb noodle soup has ultra thinly sliced partial fatty lamb that melts in your mouth!  The thinness of it cuts out any game-y taste so that even lamb haters don't taste it.  The soup broth is completely unique with spices that are mysterious to me.  Perhaps a bit of curry but no idea.  I've never tasted anything similar and it's to die for.  I want it as I am typing this.  The dumplings are decent as well and she will pan fry them on request.  Hot and sour bean noodle soup is  ultra flavor concentrated and good.  Few know about this place but it's great."}
{"text":"Over all my experience here was all good.
The whole place was clean and spacious the tabes had a nice layout to them and I'm pretty sure there is a private booth for parties. 
The lady that took my order was definitely patient with me since I had no idea what I wanted to get. I also did the check in thing for a free egg roll. Lol 
Let me also say I was not sure what to expect from this noodle house due to their location but man I'm glad I tried it. The noodles & beef were pretty damn good. I did add a little bit Sauce because I like my food on the spicy side but over all it was good as is. 
I'll definitely be returning here to try some more things. the price was not bad either, I rather come here then go to Panda Express."}
{"text":"We loved it!  Located in a strip mall next to the Burger King, the outside is unimpressive, the inside equally so. But that is where the blandness ended. After seating, we were giving these huge menus and a dry erase marker.  You use the marker to mark on the menu what you want.  Remember to pay attention to the menu selection sections, they have a \"dinner\" section and an \"a la carte\".

The food was fresh and delicious.  I had the kung pao chicken, my wife the sweet and sour chicken, both with rice, egg roll, and egg drop soup.  I regretted not trying something outside my usual Chinese dish.  Looking at the other tables, their food looked so much better.  I recommend trying a noodle dish, any noodle dish, as opposed to the typical Chinese fare you can get anywhere else.

The service was good, the lady who was serving us, explained the menu and was quick with the food and drinks. Be warned, she has a heavy accent but is still understandable."}
{"text":"I think most of these reviews are from employees or family members. The pork and chicken very cheap cuts of meat. The rice was good but most everything else was somewhat flavorless. Be a lot better choices in Mesa. Should've known when I went in there and we were the only people in there."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously good!!! If I was a local, I would be a regular.

We ordered a lot. Here's a dish breakdown:

1. Fried Black Bean Zha Jiang Mian: Flavorful, noodle texture was perfect, the fried bean curd and sauce was a little too salty, so taste before you add/mix.

2. Szechuan Dandan Noodles: Very mild spice, which I was disappointed about, but overall, still very flavorful from the minced pork. Delicious.

3. Cumin lamb/lamb skewers: Similar flavors, except the cumin lamb dish had a more intense spiciness. If you like strong flavors, order this.

4. Chives and egg pancake: Tasty, awesome flavors. Highly recommend.

We also ordered the wonton soup, lamb noodle soup, and lamb and greenonion bun, and those were also really good."}
{"text":"I'm not Chinese and haven't been overseas to China but I do and have enjoyed food from authentic style Chinese Restaurants in the metro Phoenix area.

We entered this large restaurant and got coated menu's with a dry erase pen to check off what we wanted.

We tried to order a few different appetizers and our server told us \"no\". She said, \"no buns\".

I tried to order another appetizer and she said, \"no\".

My husband tried order something and she said, \"no\".

She suggested something spicy with a Chinese Name that I didn't know what it was so I asked her what was in it and she stuck out her tongue to me. It took me a moment to understand the connection. I wasn't in the mood for her spicy Chinese tongue so I asked for chicken and celery dumplings.

I ordered the eggplant with beef noodles in thick gravy. The noodles were very good. The eggplant was cooked nicely. The beef was really tender. It was just in a sauce I didn't care for. The sauce had a prominent taste I can't identify that I don't care for. My husband tasted it and he liked it even less than I did.

My husband's dan dan noodles were good.

The dumplings arrived when we finished the noodle bowls.

I thought the dumplings were good. Anybody would like the dumplings.

For me this was a little hit and miss.

Prices were low. 

Portions were big.

Slight language barrier."}
{"text":"Second visit and love the youtiao with Soy milk. Spicy tender cold noodles is a must try."}
{"text":"Don't wanna recall that memories! Used to be good, now is so........ OMG. Worst dinning experience of 2015, so glad is Dec 30th!"}
{"text":"This has to be best chinese food I've ever had! Every dish was completely on point. Huge portions too!"}
{"text":"Great food and good service.  I ordered spicy noodle , wonton soup and fish dish.  Came out very nice.  Since my husband likes soup so she gave us a big bowl of soup for the price if small bowl. Very nice of the lady"}
{"text":"Nice facility, roomy, clean and nicely decorated.  Our server spoke pretty good English, attentive at first, somewhat not around after a bit.  The food was fairly priced, very large portions, everything good and hot.  A friend and I decided to give them a try.  I asked about the check-in deal and our server said it was no longer pot stickers, but instead an egg roll.  My friend ordered a combo plate of chicken kung pao which included an egg roll, a crab angel and egg drop soup.  We didn't realize that they put my check-in egg roll on her plate and she ate both of them and said they were very good.  She also ordered scallion pancakes which didn't have a lot of flavor and were a bit greasy.  I'd give them a 2 of 5.  I ordered pork leek dumplings, whose noodle skins were wonderful as well as their meat filling, but I had to make my own dipping sauce with what I found on the table, (soy sauce, vinegar, hot chili oil and sugar).  I'd give them a 4 of 5.  My main dish was beef eggplant noodles with thick gravy.  The meat was very fatty and the eggplant was cut into little pieces which almost disintegrated to the touch, a nice way to describe \"mushy\".  Lots and lots of wonderful noodles, but the sauce was not thick but rather soupy and didn't stick to anything.  The flavor was very mild, like a beef broth.  I'd give it a 2 1/2 out of 5 as I would give the overall rating for this restaurant but there are no half stars so I will say 2 overall.  $29 and change, no drinks, no dessert, I was disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food, great service. They are willing to spice up and change the dishes to your liking!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Food was ample portions. I had the orange beef, and my companion had the beef noodle soup. The appetizer soup was a chicken with noodles and vegetables soup. That was virtually tasteless. But the two entries were quite well done. For the price, very competitive. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good. The food is very authentic.   Noodles are hand made.  My favorite dishes are the dandan mien and the braised pork soup.  My son loves the scallion pancakes and the chives boxes.  The Chinese broccoli is outstanding. They even sell frozen home made dumplings to go that make for super convenient future meals. In my opinion this place is currently the best Chinese place in the valley."}
{"text":"Really delicious authentic food and kind service. It was quiet inside. Definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"Came here with my family to eat and told the our sevrer to just bring all the best items out and don't stop til we said so, hah. We had so many authentic dishes it was unbelievable how flavorful every single dish was! I wasn't disappointed in any of the food that came out, everything tasted extremely fresh and delicious .  You definitely can't go to any other Asian place to get flavors like this, everything tasted like secret handed down recipes! But I do agree with other patrons that there is a slight language barrier, other than that, loved this place!"}
{"text":"Like les miserables,
Empty chairs, empty tables.
But food is so slow.

Typos everywhere.
Menu is kind of a mess.
Sprawling, and dirty.

Dad was bit by a skeeter
Chopsticks came in canvas bags
And they smelled dirty

False advertising
Newspaper ad said one thing
Owner says it's wrong

Order chicken dish
Teriyaki with some rice
Soup, roll, and rangoon.

Server forgot soup
Made with bagged, frozen veggies
It was flavorless

Chicken dish tiny
Just 9 pieces of chicken
And mountains of rice

Menu said fried rice
Came out steamed and really dry
Such bad serving size

Crab Rangoon was cold
Found cloth fibers on spring roll
We waited for this?

Vegetables were gross
They were dry and going black
Can't believe this crap."}
{"text":"everything was tasty! they are a bit pricy, but portion was big. i went with my two friends and we ordered egg&tomato noodles, spicy lamb noodles, peppered pork soup noodles and a side of grilled chicken wings. i liked the taste of chinese hot tea. food was great, service was ok. will come back to try other menus."}
{"text":"Fresh authentic food. Very clean. Came in near close and never felt rushed. We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with 15 of us.  LOL!  We roll in large groups when it comes to food.  Our table did our own ordering, I took a lot of pics.  These are the things I remember eating:
1.  Pork and chicken dumplings:  Very good but I wanted the special soy blend instead on the regular soy on the table
2.  Beef noodle soup:  Beef has good flavor, the handmade noodles were not bad, the soup base needed a tag bit more flavor
3.  Green onion pancake:  OK, that was good not too greasy
4.  Pork and green bean stir fried noodles:  Love it.  Not greasy with the right amount of flavor
5.  Pan fried chow mien with assorted meat (don't know if that was the name):  The flavor was there, just wish we had more noodles
6.  Moo Shu Pork:  this is not the one that is wrapped up in the rice paper, it is stir fried.  It was very good also
7.  Soy bean milk:  was good you can ask for unsweetened

The service was OK.  Check on us here and there, but we had to wave them down for things."}
{"text":"Really really good. Not some typical Chinese joint. We tried the signature buns and Singapore noodles, just to be adventurous and it paid off- fantastic food! We also got curry chicken, because she always looks for a good curry chicken. And this was more than good. Excellent place, and we're looking forward to trying some of the exotic ingredients in a hot pot."}
{"text":"This place was OK, there's definitely potential for improvement so I wouldn't call it a 5 star worthy place just yet. 

The food was slightly above average, but the portions were relatively small when I compare it to established rockstars- aka Asian Cafe Express. 
I liked the spice levels of the dishes, but somehow the noodles, rice and dumplings all  started to resemble each other and my palate became really bored with the one note. 

The decor and location along with the waitstaff also falls below average"}
{"text":"This is the place I always come when I miss my mom's home made Chinese food. Favorite dish is egg tomato beef. Dumplings. Their home made soy milk really good too!"}
{"text":"Just a total fluke that I even went to this place I was basically parking to go into the Burger King and I saw the place and I just thought I love Chinese food might as well give it a shot I mean it's an old beat-up run down terribly terribly looking strip mall and you just think it would be such a bad place to go and it was incredible the food was amazing the guy that worked there was so nice so cool I would highly recommend this place if you just want to go somewhere for great great great Chinese food"}
{"text":"The taste is PERFECT.  This is exactly how I expect Northern Chinese food to taste.  Excellently greasy, hot, filled with flavor, and filling.  The place tastes better than Eric Clapton playing live with a Les Paul Guitar.  The food is exceptional and every dish I ordered was enough to feed a person.  The dan dan noodles had the perfect amount of peanut sauce and spicy sauce to stir and flavor the noodles.  The service is attentive and prompt.  Although the area is horrible and the location is even worse, it's worth checking out if you're a food affection-ado and want to eat one of the 8 styles of Chinese cooking."}
{"text":"This place is in the most ghetto area of Mesa, Az.  The parking lot was full of people asking for money. The service was terrible... felt like we were bothering the waitress. The food was ok. I am from Los Angeles where there is a large assortment of great chinese restaurants that serve traditional dishes so I have pretty high expectations. Indeed, this place reminds me of the food at Kong Fu Gyoza..  which used to be at mekong palace in Mesa, Az. The menu was big and lots to choose from which is great for those who are hungry. Overall. The service not being great and the location of the restaurant is the reason why this was scored so low. If they had better service ad were located in a nicer area.. i.e.closer to ASU or in chandler they would def. be awesome"}
{"text":"Had to try this place: scallion pancake, dumplings and lamb noodle soup.  It was all very tasty and friendly service.  They make their noodles in house."}
{"text":"This authentic Chinese restaurant is our new favorite. The service and food are fantastic. Our experiences with dine in and takeout have both been overwhelmingly positive. I would recommend all of the dishes I've tried: signature dumplings, noodles with beef and eggplant, beef chow fun, orange chicken, salt and pepper pork. All were excellent and I can't wait to try more dishes on their massive menu!"}
{"text":"Not your average Chinese food restaurant. This is an authentic experience. The flavors and items on the menus are very different. The Chinese broccoli and string beans are awesome. I also enjoyed the BBQ beef. I'm on a keto diet so I didn't get to try the noodles."}
{"text":"Nope nope and nope....$20 on lo mein, crab puff things and a tea. Waaay too expensive for cafeteria quality food."}
{"text":"I got the beef noodles here and the beef was really good. The broth was a bit bland. My friend got the lamb noodles and I thought the lamb broth was more flavorful but the lamb meat was not cooked as well as the beef. 
They sell their homemade noodles here $3.99/pound. The noodles here taste good and the texture of them are great! Not too soft or firm. 
The service here can be slow or fast. I've experienced both. We were here on a weekday once at 1pm so it was lunch time. You would expect them to have more staff there at lunch time since people usually eat out for lunch. They only had one server there and it seemed like only one chef since it took so long for the food to come out."}
{"text":"Amazing real Chinese food...HOMADE noodles...and buns...More people need to come here"}
{"text":"I'm so impressed of this noodle restaurant . I went with my husband try to explore some authentic Chinese food and noodle. I was order noodle with gravy and my husband orders pork rib soup noodle.OMG !! When they service to us we both were very surprised for the noodle size. Large size noodle soup and the pork rib soup tasted very thick and authentic. The noodle with gravy also with great taste. After we finished I bought one bag of frozen dumplings with 40 pies $10 only .Great deal. If you try this place I strong recommend you buy their frozen Chinese hand made dumplings, you will love it and easy cook at home ."}
{"text":"Any place that gives you real chop sticks instead of those wooden ones are a winner in my book! I had the Mongolian Chicken, brown rice and egg roll and needless to say I finished it all! Ingredients are all fresh and delicious! I recommend this place to all!"}
{"text":"We happened to drive by while thinking about what to have for dinner.  What a pleasant surprise!  My lady is vegetarian and the host suggested a special meat-free chow mein dish that turned out delicious.  I really liked my choice too, which was the string bean and pork noodles.  We will be back and share this place with others."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to this place as it was new to us and I wanted to try a new place.  Wasn't happy with 2 of the places we normally go to for years, so convinced my husband to try a new place.  The plus, the food I would give it a 3-4 star.  We ordered more Americanish food as some of the weird stuff, my husband would not eat.

First, I placed my order about 1/2 hr before I wanted to pick it up.  Got there about the time it was supposed to be ready.  They said it wasn't ready and it would be another 10 minutes.  20 minutes later, it was ready, but we didn't know.  We were standing by the register and the guy that took my money had 2 boxes with him.  He set one down at the counter and then walked away, saying nothing to us.

Two other Chinese women that worked there were around and said nothing to us.  After 5 minutes or so, the guy gives us a look and mentioned that that box that was off to the side with some food was ours.  He never said one word to us saying that was our order.  How would we know?  How rude?

I've never gotten take out food where they say nothing to you telling you it's your food and you're supposed to assume it's your food.  There wasn't much in the box.  We ordered Orange Chicken Combo, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops Combo, Beef Chow Fun and Scallion Cake.  The food tasted alright and my husband liked it.

These were not combos - though we were charged the price of the combo of $8.60.  No fried rice, no eggroll, no crab angel, no soup.  Maybe you don't get this for dinner combo, but you just get charged more for less food?  I didn't know this until I got home and just didn't want to call back and argue.   For the 2 combos, we got a very small container of rice, which was the equivalent of 1 cup of cooked white rice.  The size of the portion of the entree is about half the size of the what you would get a normal Chinese restaurant like Tao Gardens, Green Tea Bistro, Saigon (Vietnamese), J&K, but you're paying the price as if the full portion at these other restaurants that do cater to a lot of Chinese.

For $33, we usually have enough left overs for my family of 4 for another meal.  This was just enough food for tonight and no leftovers.  So pricey for take out Chinese of this type.  The Beef Chow Fun was very greasy, more than usual.  The Scallion Cake was way too thick, but at least this wasn't too greasy.  The Orange Chicken was okay, but so would Panda Express.

While we waited for the food which should have been ready (the restaurant wasn't busy - 1 other person waiting for take out and 1 woman), my son and I ordered Taro Boba and Coconut Boba.  Do NOT order Boba from this place.  The boba was hard and there wasn't a lot of boba.  It's supposed to be slushy, but there were large chunks of ice amidst the slush.  This was a very laborious drink.

My son and I know our boba and let's just say Bosa Donuts makes WAY BETTER boba drinks than this place.  What a waste of $8+.

The food doesn't taste awful, but at least for take out, you don't get much for your money.  If you're eating Americanized type food, you're better off going to a different place, even Panda Express.  

All the while we waited, no one said anything to us and they spoke Mandarin amongst themselves.  That is typical Chinese behavior, not very friendly.  I guess I should have been able to just suck it up and gone to Tao Gardens and sent my son in to pick up the food. 

The location of this restaurant isn't in a great area, on the NW side of US 60 and Country Club.  That area is usually very congested.  Not going to be coming back."}
{"text":"Really really great food. Orange chicken is our favorite but there hasn't been anything we didn't like. I suppose the only critical thing I can say is that there is a communication problem as the staff doesn't speak English well and they never can seem to understand our requests."}
{"text":"This place is really casual. Decor could use some improvement but it's neat & clean. We came at lunchtime in the middle of the week and were the first in (a hanging sign on the door said 'closed') My stomach is glad we decided to just walk in.
The food was overall very tasty. I ordered dry chili stir fry cabbage & my date (my daughter) ordered pepper steak (OMG, gasp - She's still a meat eater!). Points were deducted because I found what appeared to be a piece of animal flesh in my food #gross & my daughter reported her beef to be a little chewy.
We had crab angels as an appetizer which we enjoyed but seemed to be lacking the crab.
Customer service is friendly enough although the language barrier makes understanding difficult in some instances.
The prices are not over the top here so you won't break the bank on a casual date (wink)
If you are in Mesa stop by & enjoy."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago I saw this new Noddle shop near another place my wife and I were trying out. It looked clean, friendly and glancing at the menu, I knew we had to try it.
     Wanting a good soup last night, I talked my wife into trying it out since I was paying. We enter and it felt good from the start. The menu can be a little overwhelming with over 120 items. We took our time, asked questions and got the answer we wanted from a friendly young lady.
     I choose the Lamb Noodle Soup and my wife had the Seafood Noodle Soup. We also tried the Spring Rolls and Crab Angels. The later 2 were wonderful. I could have eaten far to many given the chance.
     Our soups were out of this world. Mine was the Lamb Noodle Soup, with home made noodle, tender thin sliced lamb, bok choy and a Spicy broth. I was in Heaven. My wife had the Seafood Noodle Soup and she was very pleased. Besides getting more vegetables than I did it also had large shrimp, scallops and squid which was surprisingly tender for squid.
     Service was fast, friendly and polite. 
     To be honest I'm over joyed to have a wonderful Noddle shop a mile away from home that offers home made noodles, special dumplings and a huge variety other dishes I've never heard of. I'll be coming here often for new pleasures to satisfy my palate."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but I'd probably only order something from here again if I were to get something to go. A group of us ate here on a weekday night and it wasn't too busy. There were only a few tables filled and we were the largest party eating here (5 people). The menu is fairly extensive on a large laminated double sided sheet so that your can use a dry erase marker to mark off what you want to order. We chose a variety of items: Cumin pork, beef chow fun, fried rice, pork and leek dumplings, and scallion pancakes. 

Each menu item trickled in one at a time to our table. All the meat items were very tender and well seasoned. I also enjoyed the dumplings whose outer skin was very nicely made. The fried rice had a lot of chopped meat and shrimp in it. I wasn't a fan of the scallion pancakes. While the outer layer was nicely crisp, the whole pancake itself was too thick and doughy for my tastes. 

Service is really what keeps me from wanting to come back. I understand totally if there is a language barrier, coming from immigrant parents myself, but our server had a dour attitude and made us feel very uncomfortable eating here. She made us feel like we were a burden to her by deciding to eat at the restaurant and giving them our business."}
{"text":"This place looks nice on the inside. I like the furniture and decor. I liked the chopsticks and their cover. I was seated quickly and ordered a water and Szechuan noodles. There was no music, but the people were nice. The food was good, but nothing special."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic Chinese food, this is the place to go. The owner had two restaurants in the valley before this. I was always a big fans for his place no matter how far he opened the restaurant at. Me and my husband now go there almost every day because this one is close to my house, how lucky! Love it as always!"}
{"text":"I decided to up my rating for this place, because it is, in every way that matters to me, \"As good as it gets!\". I came by here today to place a really big takeout order, and I just couldn't be happier.

Items which I ordered:
Mongolian Lamb
Chinese Pork Hamburger
Jingdong Meatloaf
Signature Dumplings
Beef Noodle Soup
Piokied Ca Age Pig INtestine Noodle Soup (I think a typo for 'Pickled')
Fu Qi Fei Pan

When I placed my order, the lady asked:  \"Ah, you like Chinese food?\", and that was really about it. Which is *GREAT* for me. No weird looks, no presumption that just because I'm white I won't like something, no hesitance in taking my order. It gets old, being constantly asked \"Are you sure you want to try that?\" when I order intestine and offal dishes, and here they didn't even bat an eyelash. It's not a huge deal, but it *IS* a nice touch.

I didn't have to wait long for my food, but I was also the only person in the restaurant (that needs to change, folks!!). Everything was packed up very nice and tidy for me (see the picture I uploaded) so nothing shifted around during the drive home. The price was EXTREMELY reasonable, and all-in-all, the ordering process was easypeasylemonsqueezy.

I got home and began the grand unveiling. My girlfriend and I dove facefirst into everything, and here are my thoughts:

Mongolian Lamb - a little hit of spice, and a GREAT flavour. The lamb is thinly sliced, and extremely tender. Very approachable for the average white person.

Chinese Pork Hamburger - delicate, flavorful pieces of pork sandwiched inside of an english muffin. Comes in two burgers, and has a very nice flavor. Eating an entire one would be a bit heavy, but sharing it could be difficult.

Jingdong Meatloaf - Good god almighty this is amazing. One of their homemade bun dishes, it's very tasty and very approachable. A must-try. Same for the signature dumplings- these are items that you absolutely *MUST* treat yourself to.

Beef Noodle Soup - Apparently this is some traditional Chinese comfort food, and I can see why. It's not hugely dissimilar to pho (in that it's a beef noodle soup) but the taste is quite different and it scratches a different itch.

Pickled Ca Age Pig Intestine Noodle Soup - Very tasty, but might be a little weird for some people. If you're feeling adventurous then definitely give it a try, but the light flavour of the broth doesn't really mask the 'intestiney' flavour as much as some people might hope for.

Fu Qi Fei Pan - This has become one of my favourite dishes. I've had it at several other Chinese restaurants in the area, and everyone does it just a little bit different. Basically, it's cold, thinly-sliced pieces of meat and offal swimming in a spicy chili oil. If you have a friend whose world you want to broaden, then trick them by ordering this and sharing it with them. They'll thank you and develop some new tastes!!!

All in all, I can't recommend this place enough. In an area that is pretty much already SWAMPED with great places to eat, Beijing Noodle makes a great addition. It's too bad that it's a little bit far for me to drive to, since I'm sure that if they ever *DO* deliver then I'll be outside of their range, but any time I come to Costco I'll definitely be stopping in. I'm very happy to see them making great food, and I really hope that the restaurant brings in more business."}
{"text":"The food is good here, I got the Kung Pao Chicken lunch special, the flavor was really good of the chicken. And I really like how they have the sturdy plastic chop sticks. The reason for the 3 starts is because on Yelp it says a free order of potstickers with check in, however once you get there, it's free order with check in and purchase of 2 entrees...I felt that was a little misleading.  But the food was good and there was a nice crowd during the lunch hour but the food came out promptly and was hot.  I would recommend this place just don't expect the promo if you're alone..."}
{"text":"Great place for noodles.  We had Singapore rice noodles, Szechuan Dan Dan noodles, and seafood noodle soup. All were delicious. Large servings"}
{"text":"I need to show this place some love because they deserve it! I absolutely loved this place and have been craving it ever since. I had the lamb soup with hand pulled noodles which was effing amazing. That has to be the best broth I've ever had from an Asian restaurant!!! The noodles were great as well. We also had the orange chicken which was the best I've ever had! So crispy and not too much sauce. I will definitely be coming back for more. Probably today. Lol"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. Can be hard to understand when ordering pick up but every dish I have is consistently good. I have maybe 5 restaurant menus in my kitchen and this place is one. Quick service, good eats"}
{"text":"I was left underwhelmed. I ordered the Mongolian beef, spicy. The food was good, but there just wasn't much of it. I'm used to Chinese food having too much food, but here it seemed like they were skimping on the rice."}
{"text":"Yelp you FAILED me for once! No clue why this place has 4 stars. Food was horrible, my noodles looked like they were thrown on the ground then placed on my plate. Chicken wasn't any better. The waitress tried to tell us something about \"food service said no\" which should of been my sign to split. But it was hard to understand her english. There was trash piled up outside. The place was dirty, the soy sauce containers were disgusting and you can tell they were very old as the glass was not clear but opaque and black almost. Same for the chili oil. I didn't even eat my food, just tossed it in the trash. 

Don't do it! 4 stars is absolutely absurd!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. Tastes like \"Mom-made\".
They have a lot of food of northern China style. Too busy eating to take photos. Will definitely come back very often.

?????????"}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious!!!! Best green onion pancake! Awesome pot stickers, and HK style pan fried noodle was YUMMY!!! Definitely will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Great place, no one was there when my boyfriend and I went. Nice a nd quite. The woman who served us was so sweet and nice. The food was so yummy and they have mooncakes during the moon festival in September.  Definitely will be back again!!"}
{"text":"The unassuming strip joint restaurant jostled with a few other Chinese restaurants and its largish interior was nearly empty when we came in. However, we were encouraged by the few diners who were all speaking Mandarin and the waitress who greeted us, also in Mandarin. We looked at the menu, which featured soups, noodles and dumplings on one side, and plate dishes on the other. The steaming wonton noodle soup came to our table looking a little grey and unpromising, but the broth was beautifully seasoned and complimented the dumplings, noodles and bokchoy. Next, the boiled dumplings filled with chives and pork arrived. It too, was juicy and tasty. The bite-sized morsels were enhanced by the chile oil, soy and vinegar at the table. Lastly, the Hong Kong style pan fried noodles arrived. This was our favorite: a large plate of crispy crunchy noodles topped with vegetables, mushrooms, shrimp, pork and chicken. Though we were full from the first two dishes, we devoured this dish. We didn't expect to eat Chinese food on this trip but will keep Beijing Noodle House on our must-visit list the next time we are in Mesa."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here about a month ago.  The food is ok and they got my order wrong, but I didn't complain and just ate what they brought me."}
{"text":"My husband and I were there on Friday night around 7:20 pm. It was quite empty probably because it's summer vacation for ASU. Anyways. We had the Lamb Noodle, veggie noodle and the Wuhan hot dry noodle. The soup noodles taste really good!!!! The Wuhan noodles are definitely not the authentic kind you will get in Wuhan but the dish itself is actually quite tasty. So I wouldn't call it Wuhan noodles, but I could see myself getting it again in the future. The price is not too bad and we were both really full after sharing three bowls of noodles! Will definitely go back to try other stuff."}
{"text":"Delicious! First time here! Very authentic and yummy. Had beef chow fun and pork Dan Dan noodles, delish"}
{"text":"Excellent food, and friendly staff. Love this place for delicious comfort food. I come here about every 2 weeks for homemade dumplings, and handmade noodles and delicious soups."}
{"text":"We met some friends there for dinner and we were the only table in that place. While we were waiting, a cockroach crew on the chair next to my wife's purse. It was so disgusting just to think that how many roaches must be in the kitchen if they are roaming in the dinning room around tables. When our friend pointed that roach to the owner, she just swept it off the chair and step on it, no apology at all. Maybe this is a routine and she is used to it. We left thanking God we had not ordered anything yet. I have to wonder how dirty their kitchen is and how in God's name this place is still in business."}
{"text":"This is by far the best restaurant i been to... Good food ni e people and i love the chopstick cases"}
{"text":"I am a sucker for any place with authentic dumplings. I was so excited to try this place. I went with a friend and we split several items. We had two types of potstickers. One the waiter said was xioa long nap...but it wasn't. Just a bit so good plain pork dumpling. The pan fried potstickers were much better and had more flavor. We had some of their noodles, which weren't amazing, but not bad. The scallion pancakes were delish. My biggest problem with this place? The service.... We couldn't get a water refill to save our lives. We literally had to get up to get a box and our check. Yikes."}
{"text":"So this is a new place, I wanted to give it a try.  For the most part the service was fast. BUT!!! Once you got your food we were basically ignored by the server.  We didn't get our water refilled once. The food was good, but we started getting a headache due to us not getting any water and feeling super dehydrated. We even slurped up the ice to give them a signal that we wanted more water. We finally  got water after we paid and got our cards back. The food was good, but customers service is always what matters the most."}
{"text":"Didn't like anything I ordered.  Really disappointed because I specifically asked for recommendations by the workers...  I had the pork buns, Mongolian beef and green bean noodles.  The noodles had a stale taste to them, the buns were just gross, and the Mongolian beef was 2-star at best.  Wish I had my money back."}
{"text":"I have found myself following the owner of three previous restaurants to this place which is just opened on month ago.  They were one the owner of food court in Makong Plaza on Main and Dobson which specialized Northern Chinese Cuisine.  The food tasted awfully familiar and I know the waitress well as well as her husband in the kitchen and I have met his help who are my customers so I am bias on this review.  The dumpling and noodles are so well made that it will melt in your mouth which is what a noodle house should do in Asia.  This is what you will get in Beijing so they deserved your full support if you truly love authentic Chinese food with great chef skills.  Will return very soon and often."}
{"text":"The noodles taste fresh and they have washable chopsticks.  My husband ordered beef cho fen and I ordered noodles and meat in a gravy sauce and we shared really delicious pot stickers.  Both entrees were tasty and my order came in a big bowl.  The prices are reasonable.  We will come back here to try other dishes."}
{"text":"The seating areas are nice, so are the waiters and the food is delicious! I've been craving noodles for a while and I was not disappointed. Great prices for serving size. I didn't even make a dent in my noodles before I was full."}
{"text":"Beijing Noodle House was a bit far for me but I'm glad I tried them out. Some of the dishes were outstanding. My favorite was the leek and egg bun (omelet). It was juicy and savory and had plenty of the yummy leek flavor. I'd like to order two of these and make it a meal. 

The green onion pancake was decent but i prefer mine much thinner. The ones here were thicker and doughier. 

The fungus and green onion dish was delicious as well. The flavor was really good and paired nicely with other noodle dishes. The cold noodle dish wasn't my favorite but my family enjoyed it. It had nice spice and kick to it.

Our least favorite was the pork noodle soup. The broth was good but the meat was bit gamey. 

They offer big variety of dishes. There are few that I'd like to try next when I get a chance to drive out there again."}
{"text":"Best Dan Dan I've had in the East Valley. Everything lamb is good too. I like trying a different item each time I come in. Nothing bad yet."}
{"text":"We called ahead specifically to ask if they served Red Braised Pork Belly. Initially we were told no, and that was fine. But then we got a returned phone call saying they COULD make it and that it wasn't on the menu. We were excited and went in to eat. We asked yet again if they could make the dish and we were assured they could. Our food came and right away it wasn't even close to what we asked for. The taste was overwhelmingly teriyaki and soy sauce based. The pork tasted like tough, fatty bike tires. The server KNEW we were not happy but made no attempts to apologize or make things right. When she came with the check her excuse was \"yeah if you want real Chinese cooking maybe you find it in LA\". Meanwhile, we could hear screaming and yelling coming from the kitchen. It got so intense I almost called 911. Do yourself a favor and don't stop by here. Food is overpriced and everything tastes the same. We will be disputing the charges. 

Oh and BJ Noodlehouse??? You can keep your incentive to post a review on here."}
{"text":"Excellent---try the lamb noodles."}
