{"text":"Amazing food and service!  outside of posanna's in Asheville this is the only fully gluten free resturant i've come across in north or south carolina. They use local eggs and dairy and thus far I haven't  noticed any artifical ingredients. This place makes it possible  for me/anyone with celiacs to GO OUT and have lunch in the charlotte area. The baked goods are devine!"}
{"text":"No Gluten? No Problem!

We used FoodieCall to order from here. Wanting to try something new and healthy. I had the chicken pesto paninni and it was delish. I really liked that the prices and the portions were right. I think people usually give you too much food and you throw most of it away. The sandwich was just right and the sauce was yummy. I didn't even feel like I was eating gluten free food.

I like to see small businesses with great concepts working. Give it a try even if Gluten doesn't bother you."}
{"text":"Jaylas Gluten Free Cafe is on the first floor inside the Park Seneca Building. I called in and picked up an order for six people in my office and the food was ready very fast. Nicest people working there and the food was fresh, delicious, well portioned and reasonably priced. Great for breakfast and lunch and will definitely be stopping by here again."}
{"text":"I appreciate hard work with a purpose. The owners have heart and strive daily to serve their customers tasty, gluten-free food. I'd appreciate more focus on healthy options. For example, they serve Frito Lay Potato Chips as a side. But with more feedback from customers that are willing to pay for quality, then it can happen. Portions are not large, and prices are very reasonable. In the \"Healthgram\" Park Seneca Building. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Good food and great customer service

Had read about this on Facebook, and had to try it, have been there several times now, most recently this morning for a cinnamon roll (love cinnamon!!).  Did not disappoint.
They have soups, salads, daily specials, very good."}
{"text":"The pesto chicken sandwich was awesome -- I'm going back to find out what rolls they use, I love the texture and consistency for GF bread. 

Sides/drinks are standard soda/chips lunch stop fare. They mentioned that the menu is being updated regularly since the place is new, so, as mentioned above they'll likely update options for sides as business grows.

Super nice couple runs the place. Give it a look for lunch!"}
