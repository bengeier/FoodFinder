{"text":"This place has been remolded since I visit 2 years ago. I enjoyed it then, and enjoy it now. It's clean and nice atmosphere to take friends. The food was great. I ordered the lamb with yellow rice."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to try this new place tonight and was presently surprised with the food. The atmosphere is simple but clean.    We started with the hummus and I'd rate it about 4 out 5 on scale. They give you plenty of pita so no need to ask for more like other spots. For the main dish we both got the chicken shawarma plate. Tasty chucks of chicken topped with an awesome garlic sauce all on a huge pile of rice. We easily could have split the one plate.   Also the staff was very friendly and courteous. Definitely will be eating here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat at Sheba's pretty regularly. The food here is good and the staff are nice. We like the hummus alot. We get the lamb shank and goat kebsa quite a bit also. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This place was great! Family ran, tiny little place. Wandered over here from embassy suites and was pleasantly surprised! Gyro was tasty,  pita was great and really good grape leaves! Great service too!"}
{"text":"I stopped in yesterday and the owner said this location had only been open for 2 days. So, I'm not sure how they have reviews from 9 and 12 months ago. I got the chicken wrap lunch combo and it was very good!  Unfortunately, the next day I brought my whole family there at 11:30 for lunch.  The OPEN sign was lit and the door unlocked but we were turned away and told the restaurant was actually closed until 1.  WTF?? We drove away and passed it again  a few minutes later and the OPEN sign was still on. Not cool Sheba's, not cool!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food - authentic and delicious. It was made fresh (the tabouli was made to order) and plated with care. The service was friendly. Next time we're in Tempe we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, friendly people. Authentic food appreciated by new friends of mine from the Arab Gulf and Middle East.  And love the distinctive spices they use nd the rice is wonderful. They now have a room for group use next to the regular dining room.  The larger room has both tables and chairs and also an area with rugs and cushions for dining in Middle Eastern fashion."}
