{"text":"Love this place for the sushi specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays. We've never dined on the hibachi side of the restaurant, but it always seems lively and fun. We've had sushi here dozens of times and it is better than Shinto and much less expensive.  The manager is also very hospitable, but some of the servers are a bit inexperienced. We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been here probably over 10 times in the last year for hibachi and are always so pleased when we leave. Awesome food at reasonable hibachi prices. Can't speak for the sushi or dining room food but as far as the hibachi chefs and food go it's awesome. Our favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"Just what I wanted; food tossed at me; liquor poured on me and the wrong order.  At best; annoying"}
{"text":"The food normally is great. We come often. The waitress was kind.  I order red snapper and it was delicious.  My friend orders sword fish and it was old n gross.  My friend did approach the situation rudely but the manager basically told him he's wrong about the sword fish.  she made him another (meanwhile we said not to) sword fish like that one was fresh from the water. Wait but she says a complete meal will be prepared again so My friend gives the waitress his old plate to dispose but we only receive the sword fish (how confusing). As a manger your job is to make your regular customer feel appreciated.  The managers apology wasn't sincere  and we paid for the complete bill. Their employees begin to stare talk n giggle looking our way. We paid but the sad part is we will never return.  First bad experience. Maybe it was just one of them days but I can't return. This was my favorite sushi spot"}
{"text":"First timer here and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. The waitress was cordial and attentive to my needs. Once the Chef came out thats when the show began. He entertained us and kept us laughing while preparing the food. Very polite and friendly the whole time. I ordered the Filet Mignon and Chicken and it was FANTASTIC. I came for good service and good food and wasn't disappointed!"}
{"text":"My brothers and myself eat here as often as possible. This is by far the best hibachi place I've been to. Probably eat here at least once a month. Take out is even better, they load you full of food and allow exchanging of vegetables for other food choices like noodles for free. If you want hibachi, there's no further search"}
{"text":"Great sushi, some of the better fried rolls I've had in a while, if you're into that sort of thing. During the half price days its a great deal too! The casino roll is one that I'd recommend, is pretty huge also."}
{"text":"They sat us at a table where people had already finished their soup and salad, so we felt rushed ordering because we didn't want to hold them up. The food was really good and so was the sushi! Our waiter Dominic was one of the best waiters!!"}
{"text":"What a shit hole place with shit management. Went there for New Years Eve last night. From the very start, did nothing but absolutely rush our entire party the entire time. And I told them it felt that way. Forgot half the party's drink orders. Idiot cook splashed the sauce all over our eating area CONTINUOUSLY until finally he splashed it all over my shirt and water and beer. He just stared at me, smiled and said sorry. And didn't even clean it up. Just a fat puddle of sauce was left there. Nothing but rush rush and shitty service and so so food. Shinto shits on this place.   Will never go back and will advise others about this experience. Manager was a bum too, no apologies, nothing comped for the mess on my shirt either."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of negative reviews so I just wanted to add my experience. The service was prompt. Our server was quick and polite and there whenever we needed anything (just how it should be). The hibachi chef did a great job. cooked up the food with some tricks thrown in. The portions were very large. I ordered the steak and chicken and was very happy with it. Steak was cooked to the right temperature and it was just all around delicious. Would definitely recommend and go back."}
{"text":"The best sushi fresh taste fast service unless it's half price day   They have a good hibachi area I have never been there but tried hibachi meal they were so yummy"}
{"text":"Grabbed takeout tonight consisting of various sushi rolls. The order was prepared on time. The tempura was light and crispy- probably the best in town.  I ordered online and the total was $15 for 3 rolls. When I arrived, they told me it was $16. It's only a dollar and I didn't argue but it is worth noting the online pricing may be out of date.  Can't wait to try the hibachi some night!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times, and each time, it's pretty consistent in terms of quality. I've tried many of their items (see pictures).   Now the Midwest isn't exactly known for fresh fish or sushi. You can get far better sushi in places like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York. By those standards, this place is worth about 3 stars. I've had better.   But that would be taking it out of context. The taste of the items here are much more crisp than anything I've had anywhere else. On one occasion, they even had uni! Further, their mixed alcoholic beverages are quite unique, and although I have not tried their hibachi yet, I'm inclined to give them 4 stars for being a place that's dependable and consistent."}
{"text":"Only have had sushi here but my husband and I liked it! Seems pretty legit ! Love the lobster roll and the original California roll!"}
{"text":"I was soo excited to try this place and Im soo sad with how much of a disappointment it was. First off when the girl took our drink order I asked for a Dr. Pepper and my boyfriend said same thing. The girl replied with \"1 Dr. Pepper and 1 Pepsi it is.\" She walked away so fast I couldnt even correct her. I got the hibachi chicken which was so dry I didnt even eat it. The rest of my dish which consisted of rice/noodles and cooked veggies were just all around bland. My noodles were also greasy. The only thing that was good was my side salad with ginger dressing. Maybe just get a salad if you decide to go?!.. Waitress' are so slow and barely come back. I also got a stomach ache after going here. $60 for 2 people and didnt even enjoy. I Will not be returning.   Im sticking with Hibachi Japanese Steakhouse in Independence Ohio, next to Chipotle!"}
{"text":"Love coming here for sushi and drinks! They have some of the best sushi in town and great specials. We love coming for the lunch specials, super great deals and a comfortable atmosphere. The sushi area is separate from hibachi, unlike Shinto and you can actually hold a conversation while eating. The staff is always very friendly and food comes out super fast!"}
{"text":"Very good service! Great, interactive and entertaining chefs. I got the red snapper on hibachi and the fish was excellent. The rest of the meal was above average. The atmosphere was \"poppy\" and playing pop music. Restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my family.  They serve classic Japanese Steakhouse fare and do it well.  What a great lunch value!  Why eat at the mall when you can get something different for about the same price."}
{"text":"DO NOT MAKE PLANS FOR DINNER HERE AROUND THE HOLIDAY.  We had reservations for 6pm on New Years Eve (adults & kids).  Was sat promptly enough, served drinks and food and take out containers (basically dropped in front of each of us) all before 7pm.  Barely had time to enjoy the meal before we felt rushed to get out.  Chef did not interact with our party, just all routine.  Was very disappointed with the experience here.  Definitely will not be making the same mistake again.  Only giving 1 star because you have to give one."}
{"text":"this place has got to be kidding me... the first two times i went there, later in the evening about a half hour before close, they started VACUUMING while we were still eating... when a restaurant saying open until 10, it is assumed that they are still seating until 10 p.m., not CLOSING at 10 p.m... if the place wants patrons out of there by 10, they should advertise that they close at 9:30... how friggin ridiculus...  the staff also was lame... no smiles during dinner, they acted like you were doing them a favor eating them... when i complained to the manager about this, he said the staff worked like 12 hours a day or something, and i would be tired too if i had to work those hours... who says that to a patron? absolutely stupid... what do i care what kind of hours the staff works? if they work a 12 hour shift it's not my problem... i expect the staff to be up and positive and smiling the whole day, not just early in their shift... i work part-time at macys and have had to put in crazy hours during the holidays... i would be fired if i had the kind of attitude at the end of my shift like the samurai servers have.  this third time i went, this time during the dinner hour, the server was equally as dour as the other servers had been near closing time, so obviously the courtesy of the staff does not depend on the time of day... again, she also acted like i was doing HER a favor eating there... here's just a little but infuriating example of disregard for customers:  i did not want the typical vegetable side so i asked what kind of veggies they had so i could just get what i liked... she looked at me like i was stupid and recited three veggies... i chose one... turns out they had a fourth vegetable that she failed to tell me about and that i would have wanted to make my dining experience more positive...  listen, the food is good and i have gone because of the groupons they send out, but the service is horrible, horrible, horrible, and this is why i NEVER intend to go back... the staff's unhappiness is not my problem and i expect good or better service when i dine out, especially when the entree's i'm ordering start at $20... it's not a diner, u know...  i would never recommend samurai sushi and steakhouse... steer clean unless u want below average service"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently ate at Samurai Steakhouse for the first (and last time!) The problems started when the hibachi chef was flipping around the cooking tools. He missed the catch and the flipper landed in my bowl of steak sauce on the table. As result, I had steak sauce splattered in my hair, left eye, all over my face, white sweater and all over my jeans (quite the mess!). My girlfriend also had steak sauce on her jeans and shirt as well. The chef sincerely apologized to which I understood (hey..accidents happen). I spent about 15 minutes attempting to clean up in the restroom and finished dinner wearing a tee shirt with my messy sweater wrapped in a plastic bag and steak sauce still running down my back. The big shock came when the full bill was presented for $64 by the waitress. By no means did we dine here with the intentions of a free meal, but to be expected to pay the bill after having a bath in steak sauce and our jeans and a sweater likely being ruined was absurd! I asked our server, who was of no resolution, to speak with the manager. Another female (manager) came over and presented a 10% card that could be used with future dinning visits. Even after I explained that my sweater and jeans were ruined, she insisted there was nothing she could do .. pay up! I then asked for the general manager who was not present. He was allegedly contacted at home by the female manager and she then hastily presented a 20% off card on future visits as long as I paid the full bill. I told her at this point I would not be returning and would be submitting a bill to her for our ruined clothing/dry cleaning! She then angrily said they would take care of the bill, but at the expense of the chefs paycheck, and she rudely walked away. All the other unknown guests at our table were in shock we received a bill and of the poor customer care by the waitress and manager. The chef came out to apologize again and told us they were now going to fire him! I felt horrible for him and again told him I wasn't upset with him.. just with the poor way the manager handled the situation. This place has zero concept of customer service and apparently could care less about their staff or customers! We will never eat here again and have told many others of the horrible customer service and experience."}
{"text":"This place is my pick for my sushi needs. Every Tuesday and Thursday they have sushi specials and it's not just dine-in, you can get the specials for carry out (such a plus). The spicy tuna is the best I've had and the rolls are a good size. They have a lot of specialty rolls to choose from and are all so good. I like the atmosphere and the hibachi is in a separate section of the restaurant from the regular dining. This is nice so if you choose to not do hibachi you are not listening to the loud cooking and such."}
{"text":"I had a great time here for my large birthday party dinner. We reserved the back room for our party. It was very nice to have everyone together at the same time. One thing that was bad, was that the hostess spoiled that it was a surprise dinner \"O you're here for the LARGE party\" Owell I guess. We did visit the restaurant once before and keep going back. The food is delicious. You get rice and noodles and plenty of leftovers. The entertainment is great too, they share sake! What a fun night!"}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for Sushi. We are in a few times a month and the staff is always great and friendly. We carry out regularly and the orders are always accurate and quickly prepared. Sushi is great and Tuesday and Thursdays it is half off which is even better. Finally the bartender Sam is awesome and one of the best! We've always had great experiences at Samurai and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 9 for early dinner. The manager was extremely rude and therefore I will never go back. The only good part was the hibachi chef he was very funny and enjoyable. But will not go back"}
{"text":"This is probably not a reflection on the restaurant, and more of a reflection of my personal opinions.   I don't like hibachi.  There, I said it.  I've only ever had hibachi maybe 3 or 4 times in my life and I can only say that the first time was as exciting as it could have been--I was with my family, we had a good time, and the \"show\" part of the meal was great! But that's in the past and now I'm over it.  The last time I went out for hibachi I got sushi and didn't partake in the giant piles of carbs and salt. That was the right decision because this time I got the rice and noodles and meat and veggies and salt and...ugh. I just don't see the draw for the actual food. I felt like the noodles were better than the rice here, but everything left me feeling bloated and oily. My lips were oily, by body was sluggish. It just isn't my favorite. Not to mention our cook was not really into it and kind of barked things at us and just stared.    That said, our actual server was amazing and he took a particular liking to our group, which was adorable.  I wouldn't be upset to come back here and give the sushi a try, though. Maybe that will gain a few stars."}
{"text":"If I could give more than 5 stars, I would !  We went to the Samurai to celebrate my adult son's birthday.  It was Amazing !!  I've been to other Hibachi-style Japanese restaurants in the past, but this one is THE  BEST !  From the hostesses at the welcoming station, to the server and the chef, everyone was friendly, enthusiastic and genuinely seemed to enjoy their job.  They have an impressive array of Sushi.  They have a nice alcoholic beverage selection - Japanese beers and wine and other exotic cocktails.  I started with a Sex on the Beach (it was a celebration, after all.)  There are three parts to this hibachi - the bar, the dining room and the hibachi.  You can skip \"the show\" and eat in the dining room (I personally wouldn't miss the show - it's the best one of its kind I've ever seen.) The chefs were entertaining and engaging - not just the usual onion-fire volcano and juggling cooking utensils.  The extra touch with the Saki was cool.  It was great to have a couple of children at our table.  Watching their amazement made the meal even more special. I really like the seating at this restaurant as well.  At a lot of hibachi restaurants, seating is arranged in twos around the cooking area.  Not so here - grills and seating are arranged in larger numbers (so if you have an odd number in your party, as we did, no one is odd-man out.) They are very efficient, and know how to treat customers right.  There was no feeling of being rushed,  and server and chef were very attentive. We started with the clear soup and salad with ginger dressing (which comes with the meal.) I splurged and had the \"Samurai Special\" - filet mignon, scallops and lobster.  My son and his girlfriend had scallops and salmon, and filet with scallops.  They also serve noodles (lo mein style) along with rice !  It was great !  We all agreed that their yum-yum dipping sauce for seafood was the best we had ever tasted.  I also had a glass of plum wine with my dinner.  Their special way of celebrating birthdays capped off our experience - they have disco balls and a recorded birthday song. They serve the birthday person a very unique serving of ice cream with a surprising topper - the server, using a lighter, touches the topper (an unfolding plastic lily, and the heat makes the flower petals open with mini candles lit for the birthday person to blow out. It also played Happy Birthday !  It was very impressive and cool !  It was one of the most awesome birthday meals we have ever had."}
{"text":"Got turned on to this restaurant through a Groupon deal a couple of years ago. Each time we go I think it gets better.  for the most part we have very satisfying meals and experiences here.  The service is good, the staff is friendly, the food is hot and fresh and I always get enough food for leftovers. The hibachi dinners are always filled with lots of yummy, fresh veggies and lots of meat. I'm a veggie person so I find this to be a good ratio of veggies to meat. Some places skimp on veggies but not here. I also like this place especially well because it's one of the few hibachi dinnerplaces that I've visited that  serves fried rice AND noodles.  And how I love the noodles! The order that the hibachi dinner is cooked and the speed in which it is cooked  means that nothing gets cold while you're waiting to eat everything together and that is important to me. I always get some sushi when here and it's one place around that I think has some good sushi for the area. We're not drinkers so I can't comment on the alcoholic beverages.  On the last visit we had 5 adults and a 4 year old.  the hibachi chef wowed the youngest of the group with fire and tricks while cooking our meals! The adults of the group got saki from a  squeeze bottle to keep them busy and entertained! We each got something different for our hibachi meat choice... chicken, salmon, steak, and combo. They were all great. We ordered a couple of sushi items and traded around. There was nothing left of the sushi by the time the meals were served.  I can't say there was anything negative about our last visit or two.  I'd highly recommend this restaurant if you are int he area."}
{"text":"When we got there as a party of 4 they told us they would check on availability of the hibachi room. Then a group of 3 walked and asked the same thing.   The manager told us they did not have room for 4. I then overheard the manager say they could take the 3. The hostess said \"but the other group was here first\" and the manager said \"oh well\".   Awful management!  On the plus side the food was pretty good.   However poor service/management has lost my business."}
{"text":"The food here is great. We went for Kids eat free Sunday. I was told by the person who answered the phone that each adult hibachi meal equals one free kids meal. So we came in, I didn't even want hibachi but ordered one meal to split up between me and the younger kids and had some sushi. I have four kids. When the bill came, the waitress who was barely present for most of the time told us it was one free kids meal for every two adult meals. So we ended up spending $150 when we thought we were going to pay much less. Be careful with the kids eat free deals! I could've went to Shinto and spent the same for better service. I have them 3/5 stars because the food was good."}
{"text":"BEST sushi ever!!! Amy (owner) knows what it takes to operate a 1st class restaurant! Staff is AMAZING!! Jenny, Sue and all others are excellent and so friendly! We literally go EVERY Thursday for family night!"}
{"text":"Went here for a date night and had a lovely time! The atmosphere is upbeat and the decor is stylish. It's nice to step into a restaurant that so neatly walks the line between upscale and casual. I tried 3 sushi rolls, and all were delicious. Reasonably priced, too! I'm not a big fan of hibachi so we didn't try that out but I'd go back for sushi any day."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go for sushi. I'm a deep fried sushi kind of girl (I know, it's not really sushi at that point) and their variety is quite impressive. Waitresses have always been kind here each visit and their food comes out quick. Has a very mellow mood inside, with changing colored ceilings, bamboo trees covering one wall- overall its a very nicely remodeled place. I've never had their hibachi but I wouldn't expect it to be anything less than great. Also just a tip- Tuesdays and Thursdays they have half off sushi. I wish it was closer to me, I'm pretty sure you would know where I would be every Tuesday and Thursday."}
{"text":"In town visiting family...my first time here. 3 things we were really blown away with in which prompted this review.   1. Our hibachi chef was fantastic!! (Don't recall a name) We had a 3 year old child with us and he totally customized his presentation to her and her reaction to the fire. He didn't make a \"big huge fire bang\" which would have scared the pants off her. He kept it mellow - train, mustard squirt trick. She then warmed up to him and he did a lot more with her. He was exceptionally with her and very personable with her.   2. The manager approached our table and asked how things were but we kept talking to him telling him about our experience here. He seemed sincere talking with us and it was refreshing to have a manager so engaging.   3. Really thought the steak filet was very delicious."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a relaxing environment to go out with friends and eat quality food, this place should be taken into consideration. The sushi at this place is quite on par to the average sushi. The portions are a tad bit smaller than I typically care for in sushi The hibachi food is worth getting for the simple entertainment and for the taste! Whats makes this place very appealing to me is the hospitality. Very roomy area with staff that are friendly."}
{"text":"We love this place. Best hibachi and sushi around. The staff are so nice and we have never had a problem here."}
{"text":"I have to admit, my review of this place is a little personal so take it for what it's worth.    My boyfriend and I went on our first date here almost three years ago.  We've since moved about an hour away and were back in town this weekend.  We decided to go back just to reminisce.  It was around a 6:00 on Friday evening and there was no wait when we walked in.  We were promptly seated.  There were two servers on the sushi side of the restaurant who kept walking past us.  We had been waiting for someone to greet us for about ten minutes when the table right next to us was seated.  A server went up to them immediately to greet them and take their drink order.  We got up and left.  The hostess up front didn't seem to care that this happened as we told her.    I honestly don't remember the food that night three years ago, it might have been good.  But, it's unacceptable when restaurants do this and it really put a damper on our evening."}
{"text":"Absolutely the most horrid sushi I've ever had and horrible service. I worried I would get food poisoning after. The atmosphere is like a disco -- dark with Christmas lights in the ceiling and loud music. I would not go there again for free. Stay away!!! The waitress kept calling my mother \"LADY.\" HEY LADY, What do you want? Like a bad movie."}
{"text":"Always a great time! Atmosphere, food and chef are always great!! Would highly recommend this to anyone!! 100% better then Shinto.."}
{"text":"We usually go to Samurai every other week because it's that good and I can get my sushi fix and my wife can get her hibachi chicken fix. My favorites include the sushi deluxe dinner, the sashimi deluxe dinner if I'm not in the mood for rice, and the the spider roll. The sushi is extremely fresh and good deals can be found on Tuesday's and Thursday's as those are half price sushi nights. My wife gets the hibachi chicken every time and loves it. The portions are enormous and the chicken comes with the typical hibachi veggies, fried rice, fried noodles, and the 2 shrimp hibachi appetizer. Both the sushi and hibachi also come with soup and salad as an appetizer. Our 18mo old loves loves loves the miso soup. The service is always excellent especially if you are lucky enough to get Sue as your waitress...she rocks! IMO Samurai offers the best service, quality, and value for sushi in the Strongsville area."}
{"text":"Great Hibachi!  My son and I just had the best experience.  The Hibachi chef was everything you would want, and the staff was so friendly and helpful.   We were laughing the whole time.  Oh yea, and we both loved the food!  My son LOVES hibachi and he said this is his new favorite."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant located in Strongsville by the Best Buy and Costco.  They have the Hibachi but you can also just order from the menu which ends up being a little cheaper.  The Hibachi show is about the same as the others with pretty much the same food.  The is cleaner than other Hibachi restaurants.  The staff and service is friendly.  Do keep in mind you will be sitting with others in a group at the Hibachi tables."}
{"text":"Food is alright, but they don't seem to honor their own Groupons & make up their own rules based off of what the hostess sees with her eyes."}
{"text":"I loved the half off sushi tuesdays. That is the largest incentive to come here. Im also in love with yhe fried ice cream. It should be a staple after eating at any establishment. This would be true if i didn't order it to come before my meal. These are the things i loved about this place.   What i didnt love was the smell of mop water at 9:00 a hour before the place closed. I understand getting a head start to closing on time but i could yaste cleaning products with ever bite of my food. They didnt hide the fact that they wanted us out and that it was closing in an hour or so. We carried ourselves as if it didny bother us buy it did."}
{"text":"Found this little place by mistake and decided to try it out. It was awesome! Best hibachi I've been to in a long time. Their menu has many options and suited the needs/tastes of my family. The food was great and the servers were very attentive. I can't say it enough how great the food is. There are two sides to this place, a hibachi side and a quiet dinning side. Both sides are delicious no matter what you order. I definitely recommend coming to eat here! Sometimes it gets busy, and the wait will vary depending on what time and what day you come here, but it is definitely worth the wait.   Tuesdays and Thursdays are half price sushi!"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and it kinda deturted me a bit, but I went anyway and I am so happy I did. Service was good, food was awesome especially the casino roll which I loved. I would recommend this place for dinner."}
{"text":"I've been here for sushi a couple of times and finally tried their hibachi a few weeks ago. I love their sushi, and love even more that they do 50% off sushi on Tuesdays and Thursdays, it's a great deal for some awesome sushhhh. I can't remember what sushi rolls I like here but I've had a few and they were all good.  In my opinion, the salad that comes with the hibachi dinner, is the best I've ever had compared to other places. I ordered the salmon and steak and I enjoyed it. The rice and noodles were average but they still get 5 stars because of the sushi.  Service is good, I've had better waitresses on different occasions but nonetheless it's never been a bad experience.   Looking forward to the next Tuesday or Thursday to get some sushi!   Go for it :)"}
{"text":"Great place for a hibachi lunch. I'm not a huge fan of hibachi, so maybe I'm a bad reviewer. I actually got some sushi, but almost everyone else (in my large group of 11) got the hibachi and liked it.  The price is good for lunch too. It was kind of dimly lit for lunch, and the floors were strangely slippery, but it was a fun place for a group."}
{"text":"After the Cleveland Browns / Green Bay Packers game we stopped here for dinner around 6:30.  We had reservations for 7 - good thing.    Food, service and atmosphere was perfect.  My wife and I ordered the lovers meal which included lobster, shrimp, scallops and steak.   All cooked perfect."}
{"text":"Fantastic service from our waitress, Brady, and wonderful food. We were just passing through and we found a gem! Delicious sushi and sashimi. The waitress brought us a variety of dipping sauces just to be nice! Very good, fresh fish."}
{"text":"Sat at the sushi bar for lunch. My tuna was very fresh. I enjoyed the atmosphere and wasn't too crowded.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My wife & I have been eating sushi here for over 3 years now. We usually go once a week. We've eaten at many other sushi restaurants too but you just can't beat Samurai. The sushi rolls are always good and larger than many other places. Fish is always great quality. And the prices are very reasonable, especially on special days tues & thurs.  I've only had better sushi in a few select restaurants in NYC, LA and Hawaii but at roughly 2-3x the cost. The owner is great & the staff very nice. I've never tried the hibachi side so can not comment on that except to say it always seems busy & popular."}
{"text":"One of my new favorites! On Tuesday's and Thursday's they do half price sushi, offering a wide variety of rolls for half off. The sushi is soooo delicious! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for a going away party. First time here and it was like any typical hibachi place, the cook does tricks, and the food is cooked in front of you. This place was a little interesting though. Like any other places that sing happy birthday to you, this place kind of does the same thing but they have one of their guys dress up as a red cat and beats on a drum. The disco ball comes out and techno music starts playing. Kinda out of the ordinary but I guess it would spike some fun if you bring kids.   Another interesting fact is that if you can catch a food item tossed in your mouth, the cook shoots sake down your mouth that is that you're 21, but this activity did spark a lot of excitement and fun for everyone. The rant is to shout \"sake\" multiple times while they shoot sake down your throat. We went on a Wednesday night so it wasn't really busy so the service was good. They had $5 Martini special so some of us took advantage of that. The green tea and mango martini are good choices to pick. For combination dinners, they range anywhere from $19 up. I got steak and scallops and that was reasonably priced. It came with salad, 2 extra shrimp, noodles, rice, and vegetables.   Overall, the food tasted alright to me. It was a bit salty for me because it had too much of soy sauce and I'm not a big fan for that stuff. The food was heavy so beware if you get food coma after. It's located right in that shopping plaza by Best Buy across from the mall. One of the plus is that it's on the modern side of things so the place looks nice and they do have a sit down bar out by the door."}
{"text":"Like any hibachi grill, it really is all about what you make of it. If you're not interested in conversing with others at your table and don't want to play along with the chef's games, this probably isn't the place for you. There is a dining area separate from the hibachi grills that looks really nice, but have never sat in that area.Portions are hearty, prices are reasonable (especially half price sushi nights on Tuesdays and Thursdays), and the service is okay (there seems to be quite a bit of turnover in staff since each time we go there, we have a server who just started within the past few weeks). Samurai is similar to most other hibachi grills, but one differentiator is the Samurai Volcano! This is equivalent to an entire liquor cabinet poured into a funky Hawaiian-themed fishbowl (random...I know) with a volcano in the center. The volcano is filled with a shot of 151 that they set on fire when serving. Surprisingly enough, the drink is fruity deliciousness and at $10 a pop, splitting one of these is a fabulous option for getting your drink on for cheap. I would also recommend the Samurai sushi roll which is deep-fried goodness. There were three birthday celebrations taking place while we were there most recently and they've got quirky down to an art. A giant green bunny (disturbingly reminiscent of Donnie Darko's friend Frank, in my opinion) came out banging a drum, but the kids seemed to enjoy it. Frank was followed by one of the coolest birthday treats ever, though, so I'll let the creepiness factor slide. The server lit the top of a plastic flower bud on the dessert plate, which reminded me a bit of a roman candle. The flower then opened its petals up and a candle was lit on each petal. I have no idea what kind of dessert it actually was, but the entertainment factor alone makes me want to go back for my birthday!"}
{"text":"We went for hibachi lunch but ended up with hibachi dinner. The service was good but the price is obviously too high for the quality of food compared to what we got from other hibachi places. Most frustratingly, our hibachi salmon wasn't fully cooked and my friend had to rush into bathroom in the afternoon. So we don't think the salmon was fresh.  The fried rice was only cooked with soy sauce, so there was not much flavor to it."}
{"text":"Went for an early evening. Restaurant was fine not bad.. Chef was pretty entertaining. We ordered chicken and Salman in hibachi. Salman was okeish.. Chicken, our main dish was pretty average.. It was bland and a little hard / not tender..  3 star was as we had good time.. But the food spoiled it all. 70 bucks for two people.. Nice time and mediocre food.."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I recently ate at Samurai Steakhouse for the first (and last time!) The problems started when the hibachi chef was flipping around the cooking tools. He missed the catch and the flipper landed in my bowl of steak sauce on the table. As result, I had steak sauce splattered in my hair, left eye, all over my face, white sweater and all over my jeans (quite the mess!). My girlfriend also had steak sauce on her jeans and shirt as well. The chef sincerely apologized to which I understood (hey..accidents happen). I spent about 15 minutes attempting to clean up in the restroom and finished dinner wearing a tee shirt with my messy sweater wrapped in a plastic bag and steak sauce still running down my back. The big shock came when the full bill was presented for $64 by the waitress. By no means did we dine here with the intentions of a free meal, but to be expected to pay the bill after having a bath in steak sauce and our jeans and a sweater likely being ruined was absurd! I asked our server, who was of no resolution, to speak with the manager. Another female (manager) came over and presented a 10% card that could be used with future dinning visits. Even after I explained that my sweater and jeans were ruined, she insisted there was nothing she could do .. pay up! I then asked for the general manager who was not present. He was allegedly contacted at home by the female manager and she then hastily presented a 20% off card on future visits as long as I paid the full bill. I told her at this point I would not be returning and would be submitting a bill to her for our ruined clothing/dry cleaning! She then angrily said they would take care of the bill, but at the expense of the chefs paycheck, and she rudely walked away. All the other unknown guests at our table were in shock we received a bill and of the poor customer care by the waitress and manager. The chef came out to apologize again and told us they were now going to fire him! I felt horrible for him and again told him I wasn't upset with him.. just with the poor way the manager handled the situation. This place has zero concept of customer service and apparently could care less about their staff or customers! We will never eat here again and have told many others of the horrible customer service and experience."}
{"text":"We decided to visit this place to celebrate our daughter's birthday with family and had 8 to our party. The staff was friendly and seated us right away and amazed how fast our waitress was able to seat us, take our orders, and then the chef start his presentation.   The Chef must of been tired from long hours because seemed like not interested in doing anything other than make the food with taking out the usual Awesome presentation  that all really enjoy and one of the reasons we like visiting this place.   The soup was very bland and nobody wanted their soup and became the quick joke everyone trying to give it away at our table with no takers...  The salad is something I usually look forward to having but cant say it was good this time and not sure what changed on the dressing but just was not very good....   We could hear a discussion going on between a few couples, waitress, and then the manager who needs to smile a bit more in regards to the great Groupon deal that really helps drive the business to this establishment. I see these customers commented today and a little funny sitting at kitchen table and wife saying hey those are the couples from last night!   The problem is that once you get there with your party some real confusion on how many coupon's can be used verse how many to your party and really strange to hear the manager say no I seen how many people that were sitting with you and we watch for this... The one person commented what? how do you know who is with me and who is not?  This is hibachi you wait for X amount of people to fill up a table and then begin.   The food was good as usual and still most likely visit in the future hoping a few things will change before our next gathering. We will check out at least one similar place to compare beforehand because always Samurai Sushi and Steakhouse when we wanted this type of food in the past.   A few comments:   1. It was nice that the staff brought out a electronic birthday candles that you light and after heating up opens and sing happy birthday. My daughter loved the ice cream as well and funny the toy candles kept playing and a few at the table being funny about it kept saying STOP PLEASE with the song, even when leaving my niece yelling from the other side of parking lot I can still hear it!  Our Boxer took care of it once home and heard the sound as well!     2. The manager is a little scary and reminds me of a Las Vegas Pit Boss from one of those older gangster movies looking over the floor to make sure nobody taking advantage of the house!   Roll back the video and you will see customers trying to enjoy the place and use the groupon offer that your company agreed upon!    Less is more done at 100%   1. fix soup  2. fix salad dressing  3. fix the groupon offer so both the customer and staff are not going at it when the bill arrives with the manager needing to get involved.  FIX THIS ALONE AND THINGS IMPROVE INSTANTLY!"}
{"text":"Ive been going to Samurai ever since they opened. I love the sushi bar and dining area. Ive gotten orders to go also, and they are always timely. I have had the hibachi there and the servers and chefs are great, but the décor is a little lacking. Other than that, they do nice things for people's birthdays and have an overall great restaurant. The food is always delicious and the prices are reasonable. Its great for families, couples, and even single diners just looking to grab a bite at the sushi bar."}
{"text":"This is a good hibachi restaurant,  the brown sauce is good and not just soy sauce like other places in the area. They do birthdays well, usually an ice cream dish for the recipient. The food is great, seafood and steak are both cooked as you like it."}
{"text":"Visited tonight for my daughter's birthday.  Three hibachi dinners plus I tried the sashimi appetizer.  Large portions, which they should be for those prices.  The noise in the hibachi area is deafening plus you are stuffed together like sardines.  I couldn't believe all of the young children that were here running around.  Another girl at our table also had a birthday but neither of them received anything."}
{"text":"I come often with my mother and I love there food. The buckeye and volcano rolls are my favorite. The house salad with ginger dressing is really good. It's busy most of the time when we come in. Food comes out quick and is always delicious."}
{"text":"Not good this time around. The cook decided to put teriyaki sauce on every course including my scallops why? I have idea. The rice was extra crispy and to top it off the yum sauce was horrible! First it was bright pink instead of the regular color and second it tasted really bad. Overall a really bad experience won't be going back"}
{"text":"Came here on a Tuesday afternoon for half priced sushi and it was good stuff.  Very clean which I value much when eating sushi.  They were fairly busy but my service was great.  They also have half prices sushi on Thursday.  If your a sushi fan can't really pass it up."}
{"text":"Very bad experience after they seated us and we ordered soup and salad cam then we were almost done with sushi app they seated people at the habachi and we had to wait for them to order then eat their salad and soup then the chef came out. He put teriyaki on my lobster it was bad experience I complained to the manager he could care less the place was half empty now I know why ... Go to Shinto or some other place do yourself a favor."}
{"text":"Very fun place for kids and adults.  The chef was fantastic at juggling his cookware and eggs. They seem like they are giving the Saki in the spray bottle away like it is going out of style. Food was good and portions were fair. Last time here the sushi was room temp and that is a red flag for me so I am staying away from it. Otherwise good experience."}
{"text":"So, my Uncle Joey as I like to call him, invited us out to this place. Needless to say that I was quite excited due to my love and obsession for Japanese Steakhouses. I decided to check out the menu and reviews online as I always do before visiting an establishment. My joy started to fade as I read some of the reviews, one person actually stated that this place looked like a warehouse. Which I later found out was totally false, and most likely it was just a competitor slandering them.   So with that said, when we first get there me and my Wife look at each other awkwardly. We were absolutely puzzled by the negative reviews on the atmosphere of this place. It was hip, modern and inviting. It was just a reminder of how many liars there are on Yelp, people who don't have the right intentions concerning accurate reviews of an establishment.  Let's proceed though, to the service and food. As far as the service went, it was good not great. They were very attentive don't get me wrong, just not extremely friendly or talkative. The food was excellent though. We all ordered Hibachi of some sort and we were all pleased. We did not sit in the Hibachi area though, so I cannot speak on their Hibachi Chefs. So let that be known.  I have only been to this place once, but would definitely go back. The food and atmosphere alone were enough to sell me."}
{"text":"Went here on a last minute decision over Shinto for a special occasion. It was kind of dead save for two other parties, but that's probably because it was a brisk -10 on a Monday night.  I have to hand it to them. It really was dead in there, but as soon as we were set up at our table, our chef and our server made it feel very lively and entertaining. They were on top of everything, and our chef was awesome. Like, I seriously wanted to be that dude's friend. A breath of fresh air from the chefs at the Hana (what the cool kids call it), who don't want to be there and practically sleep through your meal. Flames, volcanoes, catching eggs on various parts of his uniform, flinging food and squirting sake (though my white dress shirt and I opted out of that part), and all the while paying attention to our order details and carrying a conversation with us. Dude set the bar for hibachi chefs. Shame I forgot his name.   As for the food, I mean it's hibachi food. It is what it is. Ridiculous portions of super greasy but satisfying food. You do get fried rice and noodles at no extra charge, so that's a win. It's on par with Shinto prices, and it crushes the prices at \"the Hana\" (+10 cool pts), but still expensive for the food you get. Just remember you're paying for the show.   I also ordered some sushi. Their specialty rolls are all Americanized sushi which isn't a bad thing, and the one roll I got was huge and delicious, but I don't remember what it was called. They also offer raw sushi which I didn't get to try much of, but I will say that their uni sushi was quality stuff, and it was reasonably priced.   Overall it was a very enjoyable experience and the food wasn't too bad either. I'd return for some happy hour sushi or future special occasions.   3.5 rounded up."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check this place out a few months ago. The other times that I've been here, I always thought the food is just...okay. Last night was no different.   This restaurant is always busy & even on a Tuesday, it was packed. I got the A1 hibachi meal which has steak, chicken & shrimp. All hibachi comes with with your standard soup, salad, & all meals come with the veggies, fried rice & noodles. The chef put too much soy sauce on all the meat & noodles, they were a little too salty for my liking. I felt like the portion was a little smaller than the other hibachi restaurants I've been to. The food was just okay for me. What was disappointing is the yum yum sauce. It was too liquidity from what I'm used to!   The service was really good. The waitress was attentive. The chef was very friendly & cooked the food pretty fast...which I could appreciate because I was starving!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. The two other times were for lunch, and everything was fine. I went for dinner, and it was so horrible. The server said one word to us the entire time. Drinks? And that was it. She aggressively set down our drinks and food and never checked back. It took her forever to even acknowledge our table. Not sure what her problem was, but it was awkward and she made us feel like we shouldn't have been there. (No, we didn't walk in near closing time) My food came out and had fish eggs on it, even after I double checked I was ordering a vegetarian roll. I tried to pick them off, but it wasn't going well. Also the server forgot my sauce I asked for on the side, but neither mess up could be corrected because she was nowhere to be found. Finally I went and told the manager about the server as well as my food mess up and he corrected the situation. He wasn't all that friendly either, but it was nice he fixed it. I don't think he ever apologized though. I wish there were more sushi options in Strongsville, because this one isn't great. Oh- I also felt pretty sick after eating my corrected food. Not good."}
{"text":"Hands down our most favorite sushi spot in Cleveland!  Tuesday and Thursday nights are discounted but even their regular prices are very fair for the quality you get.  The owner and her staff are also awesome!  My husband and I eat here almost weekly and are never disappointed."}
{"text":"Wanted Hibachi and decided to try someplace we have never been.   My husband ordered a Hot Roll as an appetizer, which he said was good  For dinner I ordered chicken and scallops and my husband ordered shrimp. Both meals came with soup, salad, shrimp appetizer, noodles, veggies and fried rice  Both of us enjoyed our meal and our chef was very entertaining too! This is somewhere we would come back to  I forgot to take pictures of our dinners!!"}
{"text":"All the fish smells rotten. It feels slimy and old. Placed a to go order today and just got home. This is disgusting. The sushi at the mall smells better than this.   Salad and miso soup were alright."}
{"text":"This review is solely on sushi... The fish is sooooo fresh and delicious! Every single kind of sushi here is outstanding!! Feeling unhealthy but in the mood for something truly delicious? Try the samurai roll!!  Their drink list ranges from saki to unique signature drinks!  The service and atmosphere are superb!!! I love the fun decor and the upbeat music! The manager stopped over to make sure everything was good and she was friendly and very welcoming! We go here all the time and even get carry out when were not in the mood for a night out.  It's on my to do list to try the hibachi side!!"}
{"text":"Samurai is a great place to go for sushi or hibachi. The food has always been AMAZING! My only complaint is that every time I've made a reservation I still have to wait an hour to be seated."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very modestly decorated  and was ant to overbearing with random crap like some hibachi places are the server was very kind and attentive when my chef came out he immediately went into customer service mode and he was so professional yet so much fun the food we received was delicious I had so much fun the only down fall was the couple next to me was celebrating there wedding anniversary so I asked the waitress if they were able to do anything and she stated sure for 5 bucks which I found unprofessional in my opinion something small like that to make sure people are very happy and greatful will always keep them coming back overall a very good experience"}
{"text":"To start off positively, the food is pretty good and am usually surprised how some things come out considering ive heard their sushi wasn't good in the past.  However, service wise.. First time in there, my server was extremely annoyed we were there even though she had other tables too.. So she couldn't have been leaving anytime soon. She slammed down the drinks, took my plate of food without asking,( that I was still finishing ) and I literally just sat there in shock. I'm not one to complain or get mad. Then, after she took my food, she comes over and says \"you don't want anything else do you?\" And gives us the check. What?!?..so strange.  Second time in... I sat near the door and witnessed the blonde hostess completely ignore and blow off a man giving her information about an event he was having for his mother with cancer (usually for gift certificates, donations, Etc.) and he clearly was not used to doing this as he was completely mortified that he was talking to himself as the hostess walked away and answered the phone without saying anything. I felt so bad!! Basically, I can go for a quick snack so I don't have to drive down to Sakura, which is super good."}
{"text":"The inside looks very nice, clean, and modern. Food and service were fabulous. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Want to hear some crazy stuff about his place?  We went out to eat with our neighbors tonight. We bought a Groupon for Samurai Sushi and Hibachi in Strongsville, one of our favorite places. We've both bought many Groupon's for this place and used them before no issues in the same situation. We've been here for many times in the last 5 years, since they opened. We've used Groupon's here before without issue.   At the time of paying our bill, the manager came back and told us we couldn't use the Groupon because our friends used a Groupon on their separate check (they processed their credit card before ours). (Groupon states 1 Groupon's per table unless you have 5 or more people). How can you assign \"tables\" when eating hibachi?? Side note: the couple (of 2) next to me used a Groupon too without issue.  The reason the manager wouldn't let us use ours tonight because I told the hostess we had a party of four for hibachi, even though we paid separately. They would not us use our Groupon because the people we went to eat with used one (on their own separate check).   How is that even right or fair?!?   I could understand if it was ONE check. But, we paid separately. Ugh! So unhappy. We've used Groupon's here at least 3-4 times before no issues. But because we told the hostess we had 4 people they wouldn't honor it. WTF?   So if we said we were two and two they would have let us use the groupon. I don't understand why this matters?   Terrible manager. Couldn't even give us a one time warning or something. So sad. Then, at the end he told us to go to Groupon and ask for a refund to get our money back.... #groupon #badservice #wtf"}
{"text":"BY FAR the WORST hibachi experience I have ever had!! literally, every aspect of our dining experience was TERRIBLE; enough for me to feel inclined to leave this review.   **Please note:: I am a server &have been in the service industry for almost 4 yrs. I am ALWAYS empathetic toward servers/bartenders when I am out to eat if they are busy or are struggling because anyone who has worked in the service industry knows what it feels like to be in that situation. I'm never one to complain in a restaurant, and I'd like to think I'm generally a very easy customer to please. I'm giving this background in order to stress that my experience here was genuinely horrible enough to provoke me to speak up and leave a review, which is completely out of character.**  From the moment we walked through the doors, we should have known things were going to be bad. The hostess told us it would be 25min wait. My sister &I sat at the bar to get sushi while we waited. The bartender was making drinks that the servers were ordering for their tables, which was fine. After ~10mins of still not being acknowledged, she walked out from behind the bar and went to stand at the host stand (even though there was a hostess) and wait for people to arrive. Finally, the manager walked passed and I asked if my sister and I, and another couple that had arrived and also hasn't been served, could have some drink menus. He didn't say ONE word in response, grabbed menus, set them on the bar and walked away without saying a word. eventually the bartender wandered back and we finally ordered beers and two small sushi rolls.   After FOURTY FIVE minutes sitting at the bar, we've still not gotten our sushi rolls, even though I could see them on-top of the sushi-bar sitting for ~15mins, waiting for the bartender to bring them over for us, but since she had wandered away again, I had to ask a server walking past if she would grab the plate for us.   Finally, we get seated at a hibachi table, order waters, & wait for the meal to start.... which doesn't happen for another ~20mins. We eat the salads and soups, and once everyone has finished both courses, we wait ANOTHER ~20mins for our chef to come around. we're all starting to get a little irritated at this point but since the food is arriving, we try to just enjoy the experience...  Based on how long we've had to wait just to get this far in the meal, you'd think we'd at least get our money's worth for the actual food. BUT, the chef RACED through cooking the food, to the point that our veggies weren't even cooked all the way through. Everyones water glasses were empty. Our sauces were thin and runny, and tasted watered down like they had run out and were trying to stretch what they had. The chef forgot to use any seasoning or sauce on the meats because he was so rushed, but once we all commented how bland it tasted, he finally used some sauce on the shrimp and chicken which were the only meats still cooking. to sum it up, the food was COMPLETELY sub-par and disappointing.   FINALLY, after being there for over 2.5 hours, our checks come around and we each have a groupon to apply toward the price of our meals. the server gets the manager (the rude one from before who got the menus) who tells us that my sister and I can only use one groupon, not the two that we had each individually purchased. **Although the groupon fine print explained the stipulations on when you could/couldn't use them (ex: can't be used on split checks), when the manager came to the table we were not aware if the guidelines, so naturally i asked him why we couldn't use our groupons.** the conversation that followed was ABSURDLY rude and uninformative. instead of explaining why we weren't allowed, he pointed at our phones and repeated over and over \"Read the Groupon better!\" \"Scroll back and read the groupon better!\" in the most patronizing voice. When I asked if we could each have individual checks, he said \"We know you two came together. We know you're a group.\" then he said \"we don't seat individuals at hibachi, only groups of 2 or more. so we know you two are together.\" He really never answered any of the questions we asked, just continued to talk to us like we were wasting his time and that we were idiots because we didn't know the restaurants policies. after basically yelling at us &the other guests who were chiming in &agreeing with us, he just turned around shaking his head &walked away.   as the MANAGER of the restaurant, the head of hospitality & guest service, he never ONCE said \"I'm sorry\" or tried to answer any of our questions, or tried to diffuse the tension &anger everyone was feeling.   while the WHOLE experience was awful, this manager really just topped it all off by acting pretentious and rude. as I said, I fully understand if service was substandard because they were busy but there is NO excuse for a manager treating customers that way, and because of him and this experience, we will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here probably 20 times or more. I really love the relaxed atmosphere, the portion sizes, and the specials they run.   The hibachi chefs put on a decent show and try to involve you as much as you are willing. I love the small jokes they make such as saying they are adding Japanese coca cola when pouring in the teriyaki sauce & when they sing along to the music playing in the background.   I have seen many people have their birthdays there and they put on a birthday song and being out a flower that opens up presenting the desert - everyone seems to love it!   My top I love it about this place: 1. Teriyaki noodles with every hibachi dinner 2. Huge selection of vegetable sushi 3. Casual dinning atmosphere  They also give out VIP cards if you dine there enough that will offer discounts off your bill :)"}
{"text":"This was my first time at this hibachi spot. We came with friends who frequent this place and they had good things to say. We went for lunch and they have great deals! I wish I remembered to take a picture of the lunch menu. It's available everyday 11am-3pm Monday - Saturday, except holidays.  I would recommend going for lunch because is about half what you would pay at dinner for the same amount and quality of food. Although my friends did say if you go for dinner you can get rice and noodles with your hibachi which of course who wouldn't love! Or you can add it as a side at lunch.   I had the steak and shrimp hibachi and it came with fried rice, vegetables, salad and soup. For some reason every time I go to a steakhouse they always over or undercook my steak. My steak came out just as I ordered. My husband had the scallop hibachi and it was cooked to perfection. Very fresh! Had some sushi for the table. Which was also a great lunch deal 3 rolls for $11 or 2 for $8. Our table chef was very entertaining he offered sake from the squeeze bottle to our mouths. He also tossed small broccoli pieces to our mouths everyone participated except 1 person. We had a Great time!   We were also celebrating a birthday and they played their happy birthday recording and they bring out this really cool candle to go with some complimentary vanilla ice cream. The candle starts off closed and then as it burns the petals of the flower open up."}
{"text":"I love Hibachi ever since my boyfriend introduced me to it. Dinner and a show, such a fantastic idea! I was thrilled to try this place out. They give you the option to sit on the kitchen side or the hibachi side, so of course we chose the hibachi side. The waitress was pretty friendly and prompt with our drinks and appetizers. The chef was FANTASTIC! He was so funny and friendly. The food was delicious and everyone at our table had a great time. I ordered the chicken and steak, and it was so good! I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I started coming here when they first opened and almost no one knew about the place. Prices were cheaper back then! I miss that but I understand why they went up and I'm glad this place gets more business now because they do deserve it. Every time I call in an order the people taking my order are always so nice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I frequent this restaurant often. We have experienced both the hibachi, as well as the dining area, and every time our experience is awesome! The food is delivered quick and it is always delicious! We usually go for half price sushi on Tuesday or Thursday, but have ordered hibachi a handful of times as well. The hibachi chefs are very entertaining and the food is great. I usually go with the chicken, & my boyfriend the seafood. No complaints yet!! The atmosphere is young & fun and perfect for a fun evening with friends or a date night. They also often have deals on Groupon for half off. This is definitely a spot that we will continue to visit frequently. I would definitely recommend!!"}
{"text":"We went there tonight and it was really nice. The retardant is beautiful With a modern decor and cool lighting. The sushi bar is great and the hibachi room is nice. A little dark and the floors are oddly slippery so be careful! However, the food was very tasty. One of the better hibachi I've had in the area. Our chef wasn't quite as enthusiastic as the others but he does give free saki shots to anyone willing! All in all it was great."}
{"text":"Ok so we roll into town and it's all booked up. We get in at a Airport Hotel. We look at Yelp we see our options. We try this place. Well how weird we find a Local's place. Wow we lucked out. The Sushi was real tasty. The Sashimi was two large hunks. The Octopus was unexpectedly great. Good Service , the Bar was busy but a boat load of staff. Good find and easy to get into."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times have been a-ok. It's like a cheaper not as high quality version of Shinto, but there real reason I gave this place a shot is the groupons. They often have groupons so check back, but you can beat  deal on hibachi dinner. Their hibachi dinners also come with noodles and rice.  Also their half price sushi days are on Tuesday and Thursdays, I found the rolls to be rather large and filling!"}
{"text":"Good prices, large menu, food served quickly. My server however should have written down my order, they brought me the wrong soup and my steak was med well instead of med rare it even said so on my reciept."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here, especially on discount sushi nights on Tuesday and a Thursday. Sushi selection is great and the service is generally quick, but that depends on the amount of guests. On the hibachi side of the house, the experience is equally pleasant. You will get noodles AND fried rice with the meal along with a small salad and bowl of soup. The \"yum yum\" sauce isn't as good as other places, like Shinto's\", but you definitely get more food here. I highly recommend this place if you love sushi or hibachi!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time yesterday and really enjoyed it! I love anything hibachi but this place really did a fabulous job with everything. Now i have been to many different hibachi restaurants, some being in different states and I would have to say this is by far on the top of my list.   For starters, our  waiter was extremely friendly and very attentive. Since I went on a Tuesday the whole sushi menu was half off which is extremely affordable. If you like California rolls I think it was only $2.50 for 6 of them.   For my entree I ordered the chicken hibachi and with that you get soup and salad. The salad used this ginger dressing which was very tasty. Then with the hibachi of course they provide you with a little entertainment before your meal. For the first time I finally caught the food in my mouth when he tossed it across the table with his appliances. I expected the usual rice and vegetables with your meal but this place also provides noodles which were amazing! Their sauces are really something different for your taste buds.  To kick off the night someone in my party had a birthday so to celebrate the whole restaurant lights turn off and they start their incredibly awesome disco ball on the ceiling. If that wasn't enough they hand over a cute little singing flower display with lighted candles on top of a huge mound of ice cream.   At the end of the night the owner made sure he attended each table making sure they were satisfied with their meal. I had made sure to tell him about the pleasant experience I had.  I really enjoyed this place and they provided us with excellent food and service. I can definitely say I will be returning!"}
{"text":"Casino roll is awesome. Very kid friendly with very clean restrooms. Hibachi is good as well with good portions."}
{"text":"Server and manager were nice. Atmosphere casual and modern. They've got that going for them. Otherwise, the food gets an D and I question the hibachi \"chefs\" qualifications. They serve very large portions, of course, but the shrimp was bad as in old and inedible, the \"fried\" rice was saturated with oil and my filet was overcooked. I questioned the \"chef\" about my filet and he tried to convince me it was as ordered, medium rare. Really?? 1)I just watched you cook it with the persons steak next to me, who ordered medium and 2) there was no pink in my filet. Just dark brown meat. He offered to cook me another one, which I should have had him do, but really after the shrimp and rice I just wanted to put something edible in my stomach and get out of there. I literally got sick to my stomach when I left.   Maybe they'll improve with time, but I'm not willing to be their guinea pig. Obviously I have no plans of going back."}
{"text":"Average place for sushi. It feels like they're more concerned with people having drinks and having fun (dark atmosphere, upbeat  popular music) than with the presentation and quality of the food. The soup and salad were average. Miso soup tasted a bit watered down though... Sushi and sashimi were also average.  Servers were very nice, and I think the manager(?) also checked on us a few times to make sure everything was great.   Overall, I was satisfied. I would come here with friends, but I'd go elsewhere for a family dinner."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I used to love the Otani's in the Valley (Akron area) but they closed a few years back. Since then we have been on a hunt for something comparable and this is as close as it gets. I always order the chicken & filet mignon hibachi dinner and it's amazing. It's also decently priced compared to most other nearby hibachi restaurants. I've been here numerous times since they opened and it's always a good experience. I'm honestly shocked they don't have a better rating. If you enjoy hibachi, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I stopped in on my way back home to SW Ohio from working in Cleveland.  I will certainly come back again!  I just happened to be there on half price sushi night.  They have a great selection of rolls and it's a great hip type of atmosphere."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch the day after Christmas, so it was pretty empty. Service was great. Food was good too. Casino Roll. What else can I say. It was amazing.   Not sure why some reviews knock on the restaurant's appearance. Yes its in a strip mall next to Costco, but they actually did a decent job making the interior look nice. Has a modern Asian aesthetic. I'd definitely give this place a try again."}
{"text":"I love Samurai!  Super affordable, always fresh and delicious.  They have \"half-price\" night on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  Beware, it is not exactly \"half\" the regular price,but it is still discounted.  The wait can be very long, but it's worth it.  They do a really fun schtick for birthdays, too. I have not yet had hibachi there, but the room is always full!  CHeck it out!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant! All of our sushi rolls were amazing. Hibachi was entertaining and delicious. Kudos to our server, Brady. She handled our party of 9 with ease and class. She didn't miss a beat!"}
{"text":"Samurai is one of our reliable to-go sushi options when in the area. They also have awesome weekly specials on Tuesday and Thursday. I've never been for hibachi, but that seems to be a popular item for them as well. Great service, big dining room, and comfy booths on the sushi bar side!"}
{"text":"You generally know what you are going to get when going to a hibachi steakhouse. My party of ten enjoyed a fathers day dinner here, and it was our first experience here for all.  Food The orders ranged from filet and shrimp, scallops, tuna, and an all veggie selection. The food itself was of medium quality. The cuts of steak/filet were of fair quality.  The scallops were fresh, but not particularly of high quality. I didn't try the tuna, but the comment was that it was just fair as well. He veggie selection was boring and uninspired.  Shrimp always gets over cooked at a hibachi.   Entertainment The only reason to go to a hibachi restaurant is for the entertainment while your food is prepared. The usual stuff including starting off with a large ball of flame, the onion ring volcano, catching vegetables in your mouth as they are tossed to each of the guests, and other showmanship.  It is still fun, no matter how many times I experience it. It was also a birthday dinner.  We got a song routine complete with disco ball and light show. And inexplicably, a large green bunny.    Service You are going to be here for a while.  This is dinner and a show so expect to be here for an hour and a half to two hours."}
{"text":"Bubba Con Roll!!!!! So bomb.  Anyways, I love this place - way better than Shinto's. They have more choices, more adorable, they change their menu, they have half price sushi on Tuesdays and Thursdays! Its awesome! Great appetizers, great soups even, variety of very tasty sushi rolls and hibachi is great as well!!! My husband and I come here at least once a week for a good martini."}
{"text":"I came here after my brother told me about the GroupOn offer. Silly me, forgot to print the offer out. My girlfriend and I decided to come anyway.   I'm a little biased as hibachi style restaurants are my favorite. I frequent them for a night out so I'd like to think I know what's typical in a nice hibachi experience.   The food: slightly above average. I ordered the lobster and steak combo. The steak was pretty good actually, but the chef used a myriad of sauces on my lobster which isn't normal. The dipping sauces were very blah. I didn't particularly enjoy using sauce the way I do at other hibachi restaurants. There's only a few soups I like, one of which being onion soup that is traditionally served with a hibachi meal. Their soup.. SUCKED. It tasted like water. I was so disappointed after the first spoonful. The dressing on the salad look like it came from a bottle they purchased from Giant Eagle.    The atmosphere: It was.. decent. I felt like hibachi section was a little darker than it should've been. The hibachi area is on the other side of the wall from the bar and regular table section. The EDM music playing from the bar is awfully loud. It feel's as if they're trying to emulate a night club without the dancing.   The price: Very reasonable. This place is cheaper than Benihana and Shinto's. Which was kind of nice.   Conclusion: I wouldn't come here again. Shinto's is right down the street and ten times better. This place just feels half-assed. If you want a phenomenal meal and experience, check out Benihana. It's my favorite hibachi restaurant."}
{"text":"My first time there was last night and I'm glad to say I'll be going back there often.  The food was great and a heck of a presentation from the chef. Service was awesome once we got are server I guess they had a no call no show so it was a little hectic at first. The only thing I wasn't happy with was the long wait time was told 10 or 15 min was closer to 40ish BUT well worth the wait.  And the value from A hibachi steakhouse was great Will be going back soon"}
{"text":"On Tuesdays and Thursdays the sushi is half price! You can get hibachi in the regular dining area. The prices are typical hibachi prices, probably more for the atmosphere of hibachi cooking. The hibachi meals come with onion soup, salad, meat, vegetables, low mein noodles, fried rice. Always been clean and fun. The half price sushi is the reason we go. Sometimes it can take a while to get the sushi but it's always made fresh."}
{"text":"Wednesday night, late night - SAKE, HIYAH!   Holy craaaaaap they were generous with the sake party shots straight from the chef's squeeze bottle. I couldn't take it any longer, I was going to be hammered before I actually ate dinner. Someone in our party had a big mouth and announced it was my \"birthday\"... needless to say, I had way more food than anyone else. I shoved so much food into my mouth, my stomach couldn't handle it. I enjoyed the shrimp and all the veggies, plus the salad was tasty but could use less dressing on top.  The room itself was pretty empty, it being late and all. But the MUSIC was so damn loud, I had to ask the host to come and turn it down. It was like a freaking rave in there, and only two large family parties were enjoying a late dinner. A bit annoying but the matter was resolved. The staff was a little slow and forgetful on drink refills and odd requests like silverware.  I stuck to a hibachi style dinner and no sushi. It hit the spot and satisfied the craving until my next trip out!"}
{"text":"I believe this is the restaurant in the shopping center next to Best Buy. My husband and I love sushi but had never been to this place because it always looked dark, like it was closed or something. We are in the shopping plaza a LOT because there is a Bed, Bath, & Beyond (for me), a Best Buy (for him, lol), and a Petco for our two cats even though they hate visiting that place! So when we finally decided to try it after passing by on many occasions, we were shocked that it was a classy place inside! At least, I was. I thought it would be cheesy, being in a strip mall next to a Five Below or whatever that place is next to it. We have been there two or three times in the past year or so and have loved the food each time. It is never crowded, at least when we go, and the drinks are very good, too. The service is okay. I agree with other reviewers who have said the waitresses are not overly friendly or warm. One time our waitress forgot to bring out my drink and we had to ask her twice to get it from the bar, but that was a rare occasion. We have not eaten in the Hibachi side yet but would like to."}
