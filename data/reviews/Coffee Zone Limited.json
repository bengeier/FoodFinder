{"text":"I'm always looking for nice non-corporate coffee shops where I can spend some time.  I just came across Coffee Zone, have been here about 5 minutes and feel the need to write a review.  

The decor is kind of funky and the music is a lyric-free funky jazz. (Yep, two \"funky\"s in one sentence!)

The chai latte, as I use that to measure most coffee shops ;), is quite yummy.  Not as spicy as I would like but it has a nice light flavour that I can appreciate.  Wi-fi connection was fast and easy and the service was quite pleasant.

I'll definitely be spending more evenings here when I have time to kill between jobs!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in town to work remotely. Reasonably priced, reasonably good fare, and friendly staff. 

I often come here for 3-6 hours at a stretch to work, and this place has everything I could need that a more sophisticated (snooty) cafe wouldn't: free high-speed internet, easily accessible power outlets, and plenty of seating. There are also three pay-to-use computers at the bar ($3 per hour, kitted out with Chrome and Office), if you're travelling notebook-free. 

This place is clearly catering to the business crowd staying at the adjacent Holiday Inn, and for that reason it feels a bit like an airport lounge. Don't mistake it for a food court coffee stand or a sterile big-name chain, though. There's enough atmosphere here to make it quite cozy. 

The fanciest drink I buy here is Twinings Earl Grey, so I won't comment on whether the barista is pushing the envelope of the caffeinated beverage experience. I don't think that's the crowd Coffee Zone is after, and I'm fine with that. The baked goods here are totally acceptable, and far cheaper than the Starbucks or Second Cup down the block. 

This is a workman-like coffee shop, and the city could do with more of them!"}
{"text":"There's a party in the hotel lobby.
Ok, not really, unless Chingy and Snoop Dog want to rap about a coffee shop.

Unless you are staying at the Holiday Inn, you would never notice this shop.  I have walked by Coffee Zone a few times and to be honest, I didn't feel like crossing the street for coffee and I decided to check this place out.

It's very brightly lit and reminded me of a university cafeteria but with older people.

The lady behind the cash was super friendly and greeted us with smiles.
I ordered their dark roast Fairtrade coffee.
My friend had a latte.  They have a long list of flavoured lattes (flavoured syrup).
It's an additional charge of $0.79 for soy.
They have a collection of Gluten free cookies and health bars that I usually find at Noah's.

I might swing by here again on a Tuesday... 
They have Toonie Tuesday and you can get a latte for two bucks!

But if you like your coffee fancy, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I can honestly say, I have walked by CZL countless times, sort of glimpsed in, noticed some people doing something inside, ...likely seating, blocked it out  and continued on my merry way. 

CZL is truly inconspicuous and due to the mildly darkened glass, easy to understand why people would walk by without giving it much thought. Well, I happen to have moved into the neighbourhood and due to a... uh...scheduling misstep on the management side, found myself having to be out of my unit during the day as they did my floors. So off I went to find a cool place to write the day away. 

Well, I must say I have found it!
Why people miss this place? You see, CZL is attached to a hotel and this is the reason for its 'Cafe Of Mystery' status since most people are allergic to looking at hotels for too long, specially Holiday Inns. So by proxy, it gets miss in the shuffle.

The place is longer than it is wide, so most tables and couches have a great view out of the floor to ceiling windows. Now, this being an internet Cafe all tables next to the window have plugs(!!) plus of course the obligatory free WiFi. 

They have a large selection of coffees, teas plus a number of cakes and panini sandwiches for those who want a snack. The place has a classy, perhaps even sophisticated, art house vibe and it is quite feasible to stay here and work if you bring your laptop, although I would suggest to bring your own headphones. I would also suggest getting the hard tables rather than the couches if you need to do some serious writing. 

The coffee is decently priced and it is good overall. Mind you, as I have mentioned before I am not a coffee connoisseur or hardcore, so even though it tastes more than fine to me, those of you who must take their latte's with some serious steamed milk art might find this place not up to par.

However it is really worth visiting, specially if you live in the hood and in fact, I am fairly positive you will walk away pleasantly surprised of this little spot.      

Danger, Will Robinson! Danger! -- For some reason they charge ¢0.75 extra for Lactose Free, Soy Milk and Almond. Why?!"}
{"text":"Heads up, there's no more Toonie Tuesday promotion anymore! (You used to be able to get a latte for $2 on Tuesdays. RIP, sad times.)

Pros:
- nice buffered view of a trafficked street (Carlton)
- nice relaxing atmosphere
- plenty of plugs along the window seats for laptop users
- there are computers here for public use I believe. Not sure if they charge though.
- relatively friendly staff

Cons:
- Pricey (Reg Cappuccino+muffin = $6.50)
- can be noisy - it IS at the bottom of a Holiday Inn -- bring headphones if you're planning to work!
- Nothing gourmet - woudn't come here for the drinks/food especially.
- not a wide selection of baked goods. 

If I wanted gourmet though, I'd go to Bulldogs. But they don't have wifi there.

Final verdict: Meh!"}
{"text":"Basic. Quick. Drinkable.

There isn't a whole lot more to say about this little café that clearly exists to just handle the customers staying in the above Holiday Inn.

While it's set up with all it needs to crank out your average café fare, it's pretty clear that the barristas aren't exactly pros so don't get your hopes up when ordering your typical thirty-four syllable morning beverage.

Keep it simple though and you'll nab a cup that's just perfect to keep you going until you make it to your coffee snob destination of choice!"}
{"text":"One of these places i always hit to get off Yonge street.
Good coffee, normally quiet but usually quite busy.
Looks like a good place for tea drinkers.
From what my GF tells me they have so good exceptional house blends
Being a coffee drinker i guess i'll never find out
One of my regular hang outs when i want some relax time"}
{"text":"THIS PLACE WAS REPLACED WITH A STARBUCKS! 

Was a Beautiful and quiet place to study or have catch up with friends. I do get starbucks quite a bit but this place was really a hidden gem. 

Such a shame."}
