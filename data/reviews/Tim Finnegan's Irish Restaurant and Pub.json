{"text":"I have stayed in Phoenix only six nights in my life, but all six of those nights I got wasted at Tim Finnegan's.  A+ would recommend."}
{"text":"Relative to its location, this bar is a little gem. It's tough to find non-chain anything in Phoenix, let alone something with good food, but this place serves some sort of Irish bread (soda bread?), made in-house, with a very dense consistency and delicious flavor. 

There's an authentic-ish looking wooden bar area, live music (when I visited on a Monday night at least), bartenders were social enough, and they had some decent drink prices as well. Horribly weak first drink unfortunately, but not enough to keep me from coming back two nights later while I was still in town for work.

Check it out!"}
{"text":"Tim Finnegan's is outstanding! It is the most authentic Irish Pub in the valley, and in Arizona for that matter. It is operated and still somewhat based out of Ireland, by actually Irish, people. It has an authentic pub feel and ambiance, and is not overwhelmed with the color green, leprechauns, shamrocks and all that stereotypical, superficial and over romanticized \"Irish stuff\" that you find in most \"Irish pubs\" in the states. In fact, I've never seen any of these things here. If you're looking for a more ambient pub experience (which I like) I would go anytime time between opening and 7pm. After that it'll get a little more loud as any place selling tippling beverages would.

The food is fantastic. I've tried a plethora of things from their cod sliders, flat breads (it's essentially pizza) burgers, fish and chips, Shepherd's Pie and many others. I have not been disappointed with anything here. Their drink selection is what you will find in any Hibernian pub, and they poor the best pint of Guinness (properly poured, clean lines, and ACTUALLY in a Guinness glass) I have found out of the many pubs in the phoenix area.  They offer wide range of Draught Irish beers, and have rotating tap of local  & nationwide craft breweries, as well as an extensive bar with a plethora of Irish and Scottish Whiskies. They even serve Kilkenny Cream Ale, which is hard to find in most places around the states. I would suppose the only downside on the food is their dessert. It is very tasty, however a bit expensive for the portion size. I got the Guinness Brownie (or cake, can't remember), with ice cream and it was very delicious! However, it was small and $8, which is costly for a poor(ish) college student like me haha. 

Overall this place is a great, fun, budget friendly (but quality) place, with fun events such as trivia and kareokee (however you spell that), live bands, and amazing happy hour deals, like half off apps which are fantastically portioned and taste great, dollar off drafts, and $3 wells, EVERYDAY from 4-7pm and 10-2am. The service is usually great, and sometimes it's slow for your server to come, but it is entirely understandable because I know they get busy. I would recommend it to anyone who is look for an authentic Irish pub, or just in the mood for something different. Tim Finnegan's will always have mine and my friends business, and highly recommend your patronage as well!"}
{"text":"When I am craving really awesome fish and chips, this is the place to go. Especially on fridays, where their fish and chips is all you can eat! Although, be warned that the fish and chips servings are huge so come super hungry lol. And Fridays, they have some live music adding to the awesome vibe of the place. It's an awesome cool place to have a drink and get my fish and chippies on :)"}
{"text":"Very good. The draft cider was great, as well as the Thursday special (a 5 oz. flat iron steak). Our server, Cheryl was very nice and helpful. The fish an chips were average, but the garlic chips were pleasantly good. Overall happy with the experience, I guess I need to learn the enjoy Irish food more!. We will be back again for sure."}
{"text":"Nice casual Irish pub with awesome food. Thursday nights they have this 2 man band that's I have seen at other spots in the Phoenix area and them alone is worth the trip here. The outside before u walk in looks a little sketchy but once u walk in the doors, you feel like ur in an Irish pub."}
{"text":"This is our favorite hang out! Usually bar food isn't the greatest tasting but I would go here just for the food. It is amazing! Try the garlic fries, they are to die for! They usually have live music playing which makes for good entertainment."}
{"text":"Great pub where the food is not at all an afterthought. On the first visit, we took advantage of the check-in deal and got the mussels with the shepherd's pie and fish and chips. All were outstanding. The bartender also offered some sauce that complemented the shepherd's pie which was a thoughtful gesture. The thing I loved about the pie was that it wasn't covered in cheese and that everything was well balanced. My husband got the fish and chips and gave me a bite but wasn't all that open to sharing, so I'll have to order my own next time. 

The second time we went we took advantage of the happy hour special and got a bunch of apps including the mussels again, crab cakes, wings, and cod sliders. I really enjoyed the cod sliders. The bread was light and crunchy, the cole slaw topping was fresh and the fish was perfectly battered. Such a great combo. The crab cakes were really fresh and the wasabi sauce was a nice compliment. The wings were good- as you'd expect for pub fare. The mussels again were yummy with the spicy broth perfect to dip the homemade bread in. We found out they'll sell the bread by the loaf, so I'll have to do that for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We absolutely love it here! Yes the drinks are great, and the food is wonderful, but it's the SERVICE that keeps us coming back. Seana, Bobby, and Kristen are without a doubt 100% of the reason we continue to spend our money here as apposed to the many available bar options in the area. Our drinks come out in a timely manner and we never reach the bottom of our drinks before we are offered another. We look forward to coming to a bar where everyone knows our name and remembers our food and drink preferences."}
{"text":"Bleu Cheese Burger and In House Fresh Cut fries! Hands down the best Burger/Fry combo I have had in Phoenix!!! 
Great bartender! Service with a smile! Definitely a great local pub I will be revisiting quite a bit!!!"}
{"text":"if you're looking for an authentic irish pub, this is it. this looks like it was brought over from ireland. the bar is really nice and the entire place is cool. they also have a live band during happy hour! that's a big plus for me to beable to listen to a band before 5.  during happy hour, which they have 7 days a week, all appetizers are half off. they have lots of good appetizers. if you order off the menu besides appetizers, the food is very good. the corned beef and cabbage is great with huge portions. i've been here multiple times and all the portions are large, great flavor, and it's a big plus to get the appetizers half off. there are plenty of plasmas in the dining area and bar to catch a game. they also have a band on friday nights. not sure about saturday. i think as far as atmosphere, it's very cool and you feel like you're in ireland."}
{"text":"Its my home away from home. Love the bartenders and all the other regulars. Last nights open bar/costume party was awesome!"}
{"text":"My favorite place for fish fry. They perfectly pour pints of Guinness, too.

The ginormous chunks of cod with a crispy, light-to-medium batter is very tasty. I prefer it with the scalloped potatoes but you don't get a choice during Friday all-you-can-eat.

It's a small-to-medium sized pub with a nice scotch and whiskey menu. I had my first Tullamore Dew here and it didn't disappoint. It's a bit dark and some of the tables are wine barrels - makes comfortable sitting a bit of a challenge. The live bands I've heard were great and can be pretty loud. A couple of TVs dot the bar with all things football (soccer) and American football (if you're a Jets fan).

Service is friendly and only a couple of times it wasn't very prompt.

It definitely has a bit of character to it and I wish I had more time to stop by there."}
{"text":"Great service, decent Irish grub that makes you want to drink more Guinness, authentic pub atmosphere and live music certain nights.  

The Shepherd's Pie ($12.99) that is so proudly highlighted in the menu missed the mark.  Having lived in London, we're a big fan of the dish and were excited to see that TF uses the more traditional minced lamb and not beef.  However, the meat was overpowered by way too much dried rosemary leaves.  The brown bread that accompanied it was the highlight, followed by the mashed potatoes and finally the lamb.

This is a good place to hang out over a couple of pints while the food comes second."}
{"text":"Wonderful little spot off the 17.. It seems family friendly--there was a mom & dad with a baby and toddler having dinner and the baby was sleeping but the toddler was dancing to the live music. Plus I heard the dad speak with an Irish brogue giving an air of authenticity of the \"Irish' in the restaurants name.  My husband had the fish & chips and the fish was delicious but the  fries were soggy so that  saved calories for Guinness Chocolate cake& ice cream :). He also had a pint of Guinness (or two). Forgot how creamy and rich that stuff tasted.  I had the baked fish and it was wonderful but next time I'd ask them to hold the gravy. We're planning an after -work party here. We'll be back. LOVE the live music!!"}
{"text":"Service was good, but the food was not. Mashed potatoes were bland, Ruben was not tangy enough, bread pudding was burnt.  I obsess over bread pudding and so I left sad."}
{"text":"I have always loved coming here. They recently changes their food menu and it's a great selection of Irish favorites."}
{"text":"Tim's has a a nice vibe and is a pretty good Irish restaurant and pub. I went with a few friends one Saturday early evening and the place was maybe a 1/4th full, but by the time we left, it was filling up. We started with the pretzel bites to share and thanks to a yelp check in, it was complimentary. One of my friends tried to order a beer from the list but that was out. He ordered a burger with bacon and no onions and it came with no bacon and onions. Unfortunately we didn't see the server for a while and we made do with what we had. I had the Killarney chicken which I thought was good and flavorful. The chicken was tender and moist. Our other friend had burger and he said it was good. I was pleased with my entree but I only gave Tim's 3 out of 5 because of the food mix up, no check in with us to see how things were, and also when the bill came they forgot to take off the appetizer. I'm happy to give it another try as it has a relaxing, pub vibe."}
{"text":"Love the garlic chips. Every time my bf and I have gone its been dead...which I like. Not too loud and only a couple of patrons. Dirty girl scout is the best drink. Will continue to go back. Check the website for deals and specials...otherwise its too pricey."}
{"text":"You're out in the north central valley, you don't really want to go to a dive bar, you're not a hipster and you can't spend another trendy moment eating anything on a board.... pull up a stool at Tim Finnegans for a pint and wait for the music or an interesting conversation to begin! It's better than anything in the Metrocenter area has any right to be (in its current incarnation at least)."}
{"text":"Food was good, but service sucked.. We got a waitress that gave us attitude the whole time and when we asked for things it took her 10 to 15 mins to go and get it, it WAS NOT BUSY! Everyone in my party (8) people we all got our food at different times.. One person was does eating while the last person just got their food.. Great happy hour deal.. Just bad service. I won't go back if It was up to me..."}
{"text":"I was dubious of the food after the last menu change, and also the mediocre transition period, but the kinks have been worked out (for pub grub). Just don't order off the reuben menu -- they couldn't make an edible reuben to save their life. And I've tried three reubens. They were all lukewarm, tough/chewy, and flavorless.

I miss the Irish sausages, but the shepherd's pie is still a great choice. They've tweaked the recipe a bit since the last time I was here, but it's still wonderful. And the curry fries as well as the corned beef & cabbage taquito oddities are also good choices. I've also had the fish and chips, which are great most of the time with one or two exceptions (oil wasn't hot enough/too cold/etc.). The peppercorn burger is also worth it.

The bar's atmosphere is what seal's the deal for me, though. Having spent some time in Ireland, it's pretty much the most authentic thing you're going to find in Phoenix. And the bartender's are always friendly. On weekends it's now rather busy, but still worth it. If you see me here during a weekday afternoon however, noshing on some curry fries, feel free to join me.

If you're in the area, definitely stop by for a few pints."}
{"text":"Great Irish Bar. If you need pictures of Ireland or Irish flags to let you know you're in an Irish bar, this isn't the place for you. It's dark and cozy and simple. You know you're in an Irish bar because it feels like one, it doesn't have to tell you. Best Irish bar in the valley."}
{"text":"So much fun here! The food is great and bartender Dan is awesome!! Will be coming back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Tim Finnegans when will you open a location in Tucson? Every time I go to Phoenix I try to stop by this great Irish pub. A ton of great beers on tap and fabulous ambiance, this pub is a great place to spend a few hours. I especially love the food. This is the place for Shepherd's Pie. If you've never had it, Shepherd's Pie is ground lamb, veggies and mashed potatoes. It is amazing! I also love the cod sliders. Tim Finnegans has happy hour specials and bands on Fridays and Saturdays. If you're in the area and have a hankering for all things Irish stop by!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for appetizers. Although we had a great waiter, our starters were so-so. We tried the much tauted corned beef /cabbage taquitos, but were not impressed at all.  The spinach/artichoke dip with homemade pita chips were good, so would go with those again. Since we weren't wowed with the appetizers, we didn't stay for dinner."}
{"text":"This is a very quaint clean bar/restaurant!  Went to the all you can eat fish n chips on Friday night and I must say this is truly English fish the batter is exactly the same you will find in England.  The cod was very very good n tasty!! Cant wait to return! Oh and the waitress are very very friendly and welcome your business!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite local spots. The corned beef taquitos and the cod with chorizo are some of my favorite things on the menu.  They also have a large selection of hard to find Irish whiskeys and single malt scotch. My wife does not share my love of this place, as she likes wine and salad, neither of which are great here, but hey, its an Irish pub and I don't think I'd want to hang out at any that were known for wine and salad."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. My girlfriend and I ordered the spinach artichoke dip for an appetizer and fish and chips for entree....more than pleased! Definitely coming back and also interested in experiencing a night out there too!"}
{"text":"A great new local pub. Atmosphere was fun and the staff worked very hard to deliver a memorable experience. I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"I will never go there again.  We were brought our drinks and that was all we got.  We were looking forward to the fish and chips.  The waitress totally ignored us.  Unless you are a regular or buying booze you are invisible to them.  Everyone that came In after us had not only their drinks ordered but there food ordered   Service sucked worse than a vampire sucking blood from you, probably would be a better experience."}
{"text":"Ive been here several times and the food is always great. I always get the Reuben because it really is incredibly delicious. The reason for giving only three stars is the service.  Every time I have eaten here the food, the check, and drink refills took a really long time and this even happened when there were only about five customers in there. The waitresses would rarely come to the table and were hard to flag down because we hardly even saw them waking around. The food is worth it though."}
{"text":"Great Irish pub in the desert!  The owner's an Irishman who moved here from the Bronx, and NY Irish are more Irish today than Dublin Irish.  

The food, both Irish and American cuisine, are great.  I love my Irish grub, but incredible burgers are there to be had!  Just the way you like them; not 165 degree in the middle hockey pucks you get most places.

Can't get there enough to please me and in football season, Tommy's Irish comes out and it's a NY Jet Fan's hangout, where new friends are made every week and old friendships revived and rejuvenated.

Give me Tim Finn's any day of the week!!!  HOME AGAIN IS THE FEELING!"}
{"text":"Loved it....especially the Bailey's Bread Pudding, a must have!"}
{"text":"We just had dinner here tonight and the food was exceptional especially for a pub. Since it was Sunday, all appetizers were half off and we decided since it was our first time here we would focus on trying a few of these to see if we liked the food. We ordered several items (lamb skewers, short rib sliders, sausage rolls, corned beef taquitos, fries (garlic and curry dipping sauces), hot wings, and crab cakes. Everything we ate was extremely good. I asked our server if the food was prepared on site and she told us everything is made from scratch every morning. I highly recommend the sausage rolls especially if you have never had them as they were delicious. The lamb skewers were good and the mint yogurt sauce provides a nice contrast to the somewhat salty lamb. My least favorite of the appetizers was the taquitos but this is just personal preference. Our service was fantastic all night long. We are definitely looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Walked in at 6:45 on a Tuesday. Sat at the bar. Service slower than molasses and not sequenced to arrival.  The bar is large and U shaped so the back bar in the center obscures the visibility of customers on the other side to where the lone bartender is working - not a good set up for a single bartender.

Apparently don't know how to make a Bloody Mary - it was overly spiced and salted - basically inpalatable.  Happy hour prices don't apply to most of their mixed drinks even if made with well liquor.

You cannot get a second chance of a first impression - regulars seemed to be better taken care of than newcomers 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my top 5 favorite spots in Phoenix. It has a dark, pub-style feel throughout; but very clean and cozy atmosphere. A majority of the time, you can seat yourself wherever you like. The staff is friendly, fast, and helpful without being overbearing or annoying. 
 I've visited 5+ times and never had a bad experience. During happy hour, appetizers are half price. You can easily get full for $10. The corned beef and cabbage dinner is excellent, as are the appetizers of crab cakes and garlic aoili fries. 
All in all, I thoroughly enjoy this place and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"THE best Irish pub I've found in the valley, great staff, food and drinks. I just wish it wasn't in such a crappy area."}
{"text":"Five stars for sure! Went for the first time the other night. Live, authentic Irish band playing . Got there in time to try the cod sliders off the happy hour menu.  Came with 3 for only a few bucks ($5?). It's a cozy bar but the food presentation is better than you would expect. Also had the soft pretzels, they were a little too hard on the outside don't recommend those. But I can't wait to go try some more menu options. Bartender was pleasant , patio clean ."}
{"text":"I am sitting in Tim Finnegan's on a Saturday afternoon, having finished a tasty late lunch while waiting for my husband to finish playing golf. The decor of this place is classic local pub, and I've patronized many in the U.K. and other places in the world with which to compare it. The bartender was friendly, helping me choose from the menu a light meal that was delicious. I had the Chicken Wrap, and was able to substitute a cup of soup instead of fries. The IPA that was on tap, Dogfish Head, had just enough bitterness to keep this hop-head happy."}
{"text":"love the San Tan beer! The lamb pasty was very good. The time of my visit the bar was empty and it was just my Mom and me. We each ordered a beer and an entree. I had a yelp check in which included a free appetizer. However, when I tried to redeem it for the Artichoke dip I was told it was happy hour so the coupon didn't count. Say what? there were no restrictions on the check-in coupon. Anyway, we paid the bill and left. All over? I'll be back for the Women's FIFA on Sunday. Everyone deserves a second chance!"}
{"text":"This is the best Irish pub in AZ. They pour a proper pint, fantastic chips, the garlic and curry sauces and delicious, the fish is crispy and moist, and the service is spot on. Oh yeah, the beef burger was tasty!"}
{"text":"Cannot think of one reason why we would return.  Service was very slow and we would cut that some slack if the food was any good but that was not the case our appetizer arrived with our meal. The food was virtually tasteless.  I had the Margarita bread my husband had the turkey  club which was nothing to write home about and the fries were cold.  All around the experience was very disappointing."}
{"text":"They added too much to their menu, and they're overwhelmed. They also got rid of their good lunch specials. So, go here for the drinks and the atmosphere.

Hopefully the management is only doing this temporarily. Because I miss their $5 lunch specials. They're not so popular yet as to scrape those, add a dozen items to the menu, and call it quits. Their kitchen can't handle it.

So, eat beforehand and come up. The drinks are still good, until they raise the prices of those too.

Edit: Spoke too soon. I just went to their website and noticed they changed their \"$3 Smithwicks Every day All Day\" to the far inferior Carlsberg for $3 whatever, whatever. Oh, it's sad to see such potential beginning to tank so soon. Service has dropped, quality of food has dropped, and now they really are already raising their drink prices. Shame."}
{"text":"Best Fish and Chips in the valley!!!! Great food specials every day of the week. Live bands on Friday. From the food to the decor this place just feels like home. Good Craic as the Irish say. Guinness poured the way it should be and a very friendly and knowledgeable staff to guide you through a truly wonderful Irish pub experience. They also have a sister pub downtown that features the same great service and a similar menu!!! Try the deconstructed old fashioned specialty cocktail, it's the bees knees!"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends and have a few drinks but food isn't that good and the wait staff are indifferent."}
{"text":"Loved it. Loved every aspect of my visit here, from the decor, lighting and tables to the atmosphere, music and especially the food and service! To begin with, Finnegan's is an actual Irish-owned pub, and this place lays claim to the Guinness Perfect Pint challenge crown holder. I don't remember the bartender's name, but regardless, every pint I had was beautiful and tasted spectacular and certainly lived up to the promise of enjoying a perfect pint. However not everyone is looking for the perfect pint, I wasn't, but I'm happy to have found it. 

I digress. We came in for their food and again, I wasn't disappointed. Our server Shawn was prompt in greeting us, clean cut (as in didn't have any noticable body odor and was wearing an awesome Guinness soccer jersey!), and spoke in a friendly manner. He took the time to explain the beers on tap, their characteristics and what to expect when drinking them. He even had the bartender, Seana (easy to remember these two characters, basically the same name and they were having fun with everyone in the pub), give us a sample of two beers on tap to see if we liked them! We enjoyed them, but since they have Guinness on tap, well...moving on. 

Looking at their short, but comprehensive menu I noticed lots of things I wanted to try, but couldn't decide what to eat. Enter our server Shawn. I asked what he likes on the menu and, of course, he said it's easier to say what he doesn't care for, and without missing a beat he led me to their signature dinner plates and recommended the Pan Seared Cod. Of course he also mentioned the Shepherd's Pie, Killarney Chicken and something else I've forgotten. Regardless, I ended up getting the pan seared cod while my wife got the Rasher cheeseburger and our friend ordered a pretzel basket and hot wings. We took turns sampling each other's food and there was never a hint of disappointment from anyone and their orders. Even when we wanted to split the check 3 ways (business cards from each of us), Shawn didn't bat an eye, he simply said \"No problem, guys.\" It mustn't have been a problem, he was back in less than a minute with three separate checks! 

Long story short: Amazing food, fantastic pints, and exceptionally fun service from Shawn and Seana! We will definitely be back here and I hope to try many more items on their menu to add to this review later!"}
{"text":"Kim and i say thanks to Harrison for his twig and berries drink and his velvet hammer drink. Come check this place out!!! Great good, great drinks, great service!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tim Finnegan's is a great place to have some food and a few drinks. The food is great and the staff is very friendly and attentive. The owner is a real nice guy and actually from Dublin so it is a real Irish pub! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to have a fun and relaxing time."}
{"text":"Best Irish fare in Phoenix !

The only REAL Shepherd's Pie in Phoenix made with lamb, not ground beef, which is the most savory pie I have ever had.  It has ruined me for all all others.  Throw in a pint of Magner's Cider and don't forget the bread pudding!

The food alone is worth the trip here!"}
{"text":"One of the best Irish pubs in AZ. LOVE that they offer Irish music, Irish flood,  and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. Live music is great. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped in for the pub quiz & happy hour. We will definitely be back! Fun quiz, great staff (our waitress was Patience- quick service, friendly), & great food. We tried the corned beef & cabbage taquitos (interesting), garlic aioli fries (the aioli is delicious- could put that on everything), & the cod sliders (yummy) from the appetizer menu. For dinner we had the Reuben (great) & the Wasabi Caesar Salad- that was one of the best salads we've ever had.
This is definitely a place I hope to visit on our next trip to Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Six months ago I would have given Finnegans 4 stars, but lately the service and worse the musical acts have gone downhill. They used to have a great act Shay Veno & Jane Hilton playing every Thursday night. It was nice getting to see some good live music on a weekday.
 They used to have mostly Irish inspired acts on the weekends, but now it seems to be all 80's and 90's cover bands. They have taken a lot of Irish out of what was my favorite Irish Pub.
 The food is good, but the service leaves a bit too be desired. The drinks are always good and the bartenders are talented and the women seem to like them quite a bit."}
{"text":"I hope their Irish food is better than on St Patty's Day!  Corned beef tasted like it came out of a can. Waited so long for silverware that potatoes were cold. Service was terrible! First waiter was completely drunk and spilling food. I understand they are busy, but unbelievably poor service!"}
{"text":"Great Pub atmosphere... $5 Burgers on Monday....Happy hour great deals and Owner present quite a bit-- Love the potato skins!!"}
{"text":"We don't have that.
No, we don't have that.
We just ran out of that.
We ran out of that.

Dinky sausage rolls. Needs more pastry on the outside.
I've had better sausage rolls frozen from Tesco's.
Wings were good but I was hoping for a dozen and not 10, and they needed to be crispier.
Order the wings WET.
I spied things on other people's plates and they looked OK.
Other things I'd like to try are the fish n chips and curry fries.
Great interior of the place though, it's everything I would want, and the service is mindful and nice. 
BUT..... remember there's only one pen in the entire bar and your table will have to share it when the checks come. 
Because...... they don't have that.

So we made the place listen to \"Orgasmatron\" by Motorhead thanks to my friend's jukebox app.

UP THE IRONS!"}
{"text":"I've been making trips to Tim Finnegans before I lived in Arizona.  On a past visit my friend brought me here.  It was a place me made trips to for the shepherds pie.  I had my first pie here and have now tried it many other places.  Tim Finnegans offers up the best and it's made with lamb (as opposed to beef in many places).  Always was it down with a pint of Strongbow or Magners.

It's a good bar for sports too.  There's always a soccer or football game on.  Man City swag is plentiful here.

Service is a bit slow from time to time but I can live with that."}
{"text":"6 stars would be more appropriate for this Gem of a restaurant.Jimmy the owner is all about his customers, the food is beyond great, the service was with Anthony was excellent. They are very personable. I could go on and on about our New Place. Waiting on our incredible Bread Pudding.We will be back more and more. Jimmy, keep up this great service and great food, Tom amd Jennifer"}
{"text":"I tried this place a few weeks back and have been meaning to get to the review.

I couldn't manage to get anyone to go out and have a few pints with me, but you know what? I have no problem drinking alone so I went anyhow.

The place is pretty large for the cozy pub feel that it has. The music was great, though I agree the soud system needs some work. It is hard to hear from the actual bar, though maybe this is on purpose. 

They have a good sized patio for us smokers and you are allowed to take your drinks with you. Thank god.

They claim the only real shepphards pie in Arizona, so I had to try it and it was fantastic, though the real star was the brown bread they served with it. They bake it fresh on site and it is amazingly good.

Most of the wait staff had Irish accents. How can you not enjoy the charm in an Irishman serving you a beer. The owner was even making rounds introducing himself and he was a standup guy.

I haven't made it back yet but it is definately in the stars."}
{"text":"I'm a Los Angeles native that comes out to Phoenix a lot to visit my sisters. This place is a must on every trip out here. 

Great bartenders, food and service.  There's not many places in the Metro Phoenix area to go to, but this is it. A must for anyone anywhere near Peoria and the 17 fwy."}
{"text":"First time at Tim's was (supposed to be for) Happy Hour.  

There was actually nothing wrong with the faire at Tim's - the problem was the pricing.  

Our bill was $60.  We had four appetizers, three cocktails, and two sodas.  We had garlic fries (A+), sausage rolls (B-), baby back sliders (B) and chicken strips (A) that were all on the happy hour menus -- supposed to be half off during happy hour.  We also had 2 margaritas, a bourbon [house] and seven, and two cokes.  

Still trying to figure out how the math worked on that one, but since it was my birthday we weren't going to argue (we were just going to hurry out and go up the street to Black Angus, where six cocktails [4 margs and two bourbon and cokes) and three apps (nachos, tater skins and pretzel cheese sticks) were $30-something dollars.  

Though the food was good at Tim's - the items are too pricey for that neighborhood.  

Decor is very cute and clean - waitress was mostly attentive (only had to ask twice for a couple of items).  ALSO Big A+ because RUSH was playing on the muzac for what seemed an entire album side (good choice)."}
{"text":"Great bar but should have not gone the day after St Patrick's Day as the menu was limited to about 3 entrees- 3 people in the group got the fish and chips which were pretty good. The fish was placed on top of the fries which made them a bit soggy. The service was excellent but one of the guests in our party said the men's bathroom was disgusting. Perhaps we will try again when it's not near an Irish day."}
{"text":"I am a fan because this place is right around the corner from my place... sooooo that is fantastic.
The food is alright, nothing exciting
Lots of good beer on tap, and some really awful beer on tap.
Check it out!
I like it. :)"}
{"text":"I am the Duke of O'Connors pub, but I love Tim Finnegan's too.

I go there to drink, I come here to eat.  The hot wings are nothing short of awesome, I have them at least once a week.  Oh, and the Cod and Chorizo is awesome, It is my favorite fish dish in Phoenix.  Shepard's pie is made with lamb, like it should be!  Corned Beef and Cabbage is also really good, not as good as my Mom's but close.

The bartenders (usually Tommy and /or Jimmy) and wait staff take good care of their customers, especially their regulars.

When they have live music it is usually pretty good, but the week night people have been so so as of late.  Not my thing, but they do draw somewhat of a crowd.  Weekends are much better.  Come to see any of  the Irish Bands, or Carvin Jones.

Trivia on Tuesdays is awesome, it is run by Cedar the Duke of this place.
Look for Team Beef and Titties!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. They have such a wonderful staff of servers and bartenders. They are super personable and friendly. The drinks are stiff, and the food is great. 
My favorite is the Chicken and Red Pepper Flatbread, which is half priced on Wednesdays. But worth full price any day of the week... so try it!"}
{"text":"I am elated that this authentic Irish Pub opened up in my neibhorhood. I had the Ruben for lunch and it was the best I've  ever had, the french fries were delicious as well, my server Melissa made me feel like I was at home. I loved it so much that I had to bring my son back for dinner.  I was still full from lunch, but that didn't stop me from eating the corn beef and cabbage taquitos that were smothered in homemade green sauce recommended by Dave... delicious! Alex and Tommy came over and introduced themselves to us it felt like we were with old friends. These guys are stuck with me."}
{"text":"Great dive bar, and they have karaoke on Sunday nights! A great place to come after work for a beer. The service is always quick and the music is good, too. It's never packed, but the music is loud."}
{"text":"Great beer selections, authentic Irish food and friendly wait staff, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A friend and I saw this restaurant featured on PBS Check Please and so we decided to check it out. We ordered the potato skins, the large cod plate (which we split) and a small dinner salad. The cod batter was light and not at all greasy. The food is bar food, but fresh. The atmosphere is what you could expect at an Irish pub. No news channels on TVs (thank goodness). The service was very good. We both said we would like to go there again."}
{"text":"They just updated their menu and it's good! They have a better variety of entrees now and all the new ones I've tried are pretty darn good. They also swapped out Strong Bow for Magner's Irish Cider and the Stella for Guinness 250 which is awesome."}
{"text":"This place was good. I had the fish and chips and it was huge portion. Also had the pastie and it was great with the onion gravy. The decor is good and the service was great. Smith wicks on tap is essential and they had it so they pass the"}
{"text":"We went there for dinner on a Friday night. The place has some people, but it wasn't super crowded. We sat down and ordered food. The food took forever to come out and was cold when we got it. The Reuben was 99% coleslaw. Very little meat. My boyfriend ordered their chicken strips, and he received three instead of the four the bartender said he would. The food sucked. The bartender however was very sweet. We tipped her because we didn't feel like she should suffer for something that wasn't her fault."}
{"text":"When I came across this place I was like hhmmnn Irish pub beer, food, and a brawl? 1st Impression Pretty plain looking from the outside, nice and clean they have a smokers patio as well. Before you step inside you can hear the live music playing. Step in and to my surprise its more of a family sit down restaurant that a drunken pub. Self seating the server came over right away and was quite pleasant. 
      The menu has a list of foods that from what I know to be \"Irish\" foods some that are not but have an \"Irish\" twist. Me and my date agree to 2 different appetizers, the Artichoke and spinach dip with pub made pita chips. The second was something that less traditional the Corned beef and cabbage \"taquitos\" The dip didn't stand a chance we destroyed it! The taquitos however were not at all what I expected. I was expecting the corned beef to be in a more \"solid\" state however it seemed more as if it was minced with the cabbage Strange texture and not very flavorful The green sauce was fairly tasty and my lovely date enjoyed the horseradish/ sour cream topping.
       Moving on the the entrees I chose the Real lamb shepherds pie, and my date selected the Icelandic Cod. The Pie seems like a small portion until I began eating, the serving container is very deep and half way though my meal is was wondering how so much food could be hiding in there. It had a very familiar flavor that I still cant place my finger on. It was very fulfilling I enjoyed it and would order it again. My dates Cod looked and smelled amazing! She said the seasoned mashed potatoes were very tasty and so was the fish was really fresh and cooked just right, and could easily be a go to dish after trying out some more of the menu. To top of our dinning we gave the Irish bread pudding a try. It was a more solid bread pudding not all mushy, not over soaked. It does have some Baily's Irish cream liquor. in it the last bite I found a shot of it lol
      Over we were both very pleased with our experience and look forward to going again soon to try some thing else. However the future with not include a re-up on the taquitos =P"}

Special mention to the curry chips because they're beautiful, the other food items are really good too."}
{"text":"I'm in love.  This place was amazing, and I wish I lived in Phoenix so I could come here more often.  I was here on a Monday night with some friends, and Monday just happens to be $5 burger night.  And these are some amazing burgers...good enough to pay full price, but what a steal at $5 a piece.  We all had the burger with the onion-bacon marmalade and garlic aioli.  I have no idea what onion-bacon marmalade is or how one goes about making it, but it was one of the best toppings I've ever had on a burger.  The beef was very flavorful and while I ordered my burger medium, it was slightly overcooked, but still good.  Brioche buns topped them off, and they were very tasty as well.  The fries were nice and crispy, and a perfect compliment to the burgers.  Nice selection of beers on tap and in bottles, and a few specialty drinks in addition to the full bar.  There were also a few musicians taking turns performing, and they were very nice to listen to.  Not sure if this a regular Monday occurance or not, but I enjoyed the music.  It wasn't too loud either...we still have conversations without shouting while the artists were performing.  Great pub!"}
{"text":"Get there for happy hour.  The food is excellent and the prices can't be beat!  I ordered the blue cheese burger and onion soup awesome."}
{"text":"Enjoying my favorite beer deschutes fresh squeezed and the dbacks game. Great environment and Sam has been an excellent server. Had the chorizo potato soup and it was amazing. Everyone should check this place out."}

{"text":"Awesome place! Great service! Great atmosphere. Bartender, Dan, makes a great Bloody Mary. The cod sliders were fantastic with a spicy tarter and coleslaw...yum! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Found this gem of a restaurant on New Years Day. Service (Dan!!) was friendly and fast. We asked him about the menu, what's good, etc and based his recommendation we ordered Fish n Chips, Shepard's Pie and Killarney Chicken. The portions were generous and the food delicious. So we had to end with the bread pudding. One piece with three spoons. Gone in a flash bcs it was sooo good. 

Booth seating, high tops and bar. Lots of TVs but not too loud. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been craving fish and chips for the longest time!!!  I met up recently with an old friend of mine after the death of her sister, my best friend from high school.  We wanted to visit and toast her.  Tim Finnegan's fit the bill!

I admire these guys for not abandoning an area that has seen better days.  They are on the southern side of Metrocenter, south of Castles and Coasters.

We got settled in and began reminiscing about my friend.  The place was nearly empty at lunch time on a weekday but our waitress was really friendly and helpful.  We both ordered the fish and chips...;.OMG, they were heavenly!!

The place is not very big but they do have an area for live music.  I will be going back and turning friends on to it.

I will always support a place that is staying true to the community and met some really nice folks there.  I'm looking forward to seeing some live music there and having some corned beef and some more of those delectible fish and chips!!!"}
{"text":"Drove by and popped in for a couple of beers, a burger and the app sampler. Wow! The burger was soooo good, and the fries were DIVINE! Everything on the app platter was good, and the beer was cold and delicious. I will def be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here today for the Manchester City game and it was awesome! Our server Nicole was great! We were bummed more of the City supporters weren't there. The Chicken Curry soup they made was AMAZING! Loved the fish and chips and my husband got the Turkey burger with green beans. Insane food! We can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Corned beef and cabbage taquitos...sounds crazy, so I had to try it...it was GREAT!  The $3 dollar Carlsberg big draft beers were also GREAT!  The bartender was GREAT as well!  If those 3 reasons aren't good enough to try out Tim Finnegans, then go because I said so :)"}
{"text":"One of the only places in the Valley where an Irish breakfast can be had.

Went to this homely establishment this afternoon (Saturday) for lunch with my father and it was pretty empty, not too surprising for the area and the time of day but quite frankly, that appealed to me.

The waitress was very friendly and prompt in making sure to take our drink order.  Given the number of other patrons (maybe 5, two of which were sitting at the bar) it took a bit longer than I would have thought for her to come back, but as my dad and I were in no hurry and the game was on the TV.  She was very good about giving my dad information regarding menu items and portion sizes.

I ordered the Irish breakfast with a Jameson and ginger and my dad ordered the dinner portion fish and chips.  The breakfast came with eggs, brown bread, beans, sausage, and grilled tomato.  Everything was amazing, generous portions and tasty.

The fish and chips was a slab of cod and a heap of fries and cole slaw.  The fish was pretty good and the few fries I managed to steal were great.  My dad raved about it and he's pretty particular about fish.

Great pour on the Jameson and Ginger from the bar.  I'm curious if there was any ginger in it at all... but I'm not one to complain :)

We both were members of the clean plate club and very satisfied.  I'll definitely be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great place!! we will be back, order the Flat Iron steak over the prime rib! 
Next time I will have the Shepherd's Pie."}
{"text":"We were delighted to learn that TF has re-opened in N. Phx!   Everything we loved at the previous location (charming decor, attentive wait staff, good food and Smithwicks beer) has been transported to the new spot.  We visited on a recent Friday night and were happy to see some familiar faces behind the bar.  I ordered the Ruben (delish!) and hubby had the chicken tenders.  The fellow sitting next to us at the bar was drinking a Guinness and we suggested he try Smithwicks.  He liked it so much, he had two!  We'll definitely be back, for more beer, fun and fellowship!"}
{"text":"Met Sean, their awesome manager who was also our server and bartender for the evening. He was awesome and got our drink orders right away and had our drinks ready moments later. Played some Queen and The Eagles to mix things up and then back to the awesome Irish playlist. 
Loved the music. 

Monday was $5 burger day with $2 side. 

We got a Northsider and a Blu Cheese. Both were delicious. Fries were perfectly cooked and my salad had good veggies on it. 

We'll be back, for sure! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Tim's has become our local.  We really, really like the food here.  I've had corned beef and cabbage at one other Irish bar in town, and it didn't even belong in the same category.  Tim's corned beef is flavorful and lean, and what the cook does with Irish bacon in his cabbage makes my toes curl with delight: I've never had better.  I could eat the Shepherd's Pie every day; husband loves the Garlic Chicken and gets extra Irish bread.  The Irish breakfast is good, the fish on AYCE Friday nights is fresh, fabulously lightly breaded and they'll make up cocktail sauce to order.  An earlier reviewer didn't like the corned beef taquitos and I agree - when I first had them I thought they were not good at all; I had some last Tuesday night (Pub Trivia night) and they were delish.  So are their fish tacos on Taco Tuesday.  Really, there is nothing they serve we haven't liked. I don't like bar food; I love Tim Finnegan's food.

The bartenders and servers are great; the bar has a wide selection of Irish and Scotch whiskey/whisky.  There are specials every night but Saturday, and happy hour all day Sunday.  It's a great place to gather with friends for good food and drink.

{"text":"If you like Irish pubs, this is it. 
No nonsense, proper drinks, great staff. Cheers."}
{"text":"Bomb place. Great food, great happy hour, great specials. Get the corned beef and cabbage taquitos!"}
{"text":"Nga WHAT!!! This is a secret I don't want anyone to know about. But that wouldn't be nice. Taquitos are stupid good. I can't wait to go back. Reuben was really good too."}
{"text":"Pretty cool Irish bar on the southside of metrocenter.  Theres not much to go to metro anymore for but Tim Finnegans is a good reason.  

This place has been here for a long time and worth stopping by.  The inside is dim lit.  Theres a ton of wood.  The happy hour is decent: 5 bucks for wings 3 for fries and 4 dollar drinks.

The staff is all friendly and attentive.  There is even a band in there most nights.  If you are nearby and looking for a classic bar look no further. 

They even have a good selection of craft: grapefruit sculpin, fresh squeezed ipa, kiltlifter, and a few others."}
{"text":"Random.

I am sleeping. My friend wakes me up from my castle at 12am, banging on my door saying I have to go out to night! Clothes on, ID in hand...off I go.

He brings me to this place!!  I am not one for dive bars, nor partial to being disappointed.  Dives are necessary every once a while.  This place has the feel of a dive but has the crowd of a well established bar. 

Mixed feelings about this place. Curious how the weekends are?!

Almost out of my grog from my sleep, my buddies decide 3 tequila shots are due. Salt on, shot glasses in hand...off I go. 

The 'tender was a nice guy, seemed to like his job. Quick to the order and fast to the tab. Thank you!

 FINAL ThoughTs: Aside from the acres of room to sit, Tim's has what so many dives don't have, which is the personality of a reputable bar. A great place to go with friends after the daze of a treacherous weekend. 


NOTE: Avoid the patio after 12:30am. I have seen coke heads both times I have gone. Coincidence??

{"text":"Tim Finnegans is back and in a much better area!

I was sad when this spot closed down at GhettroCenter.  My friends and I would meet up there once in a while to catch up.  Its hard to find an old school feeling Irish bar worth going to in Phoenix.  

We recently met up at this new spot.  It has the old wooden bar with brass fittings and a cool green neon light underneath to give it a fresh feel.  

Unfortunately, the building it is in doesn't have much for a patio or cool look to the outside but we will take what we can get.  Just happy it's not a chain and they are back in business!

Excellent whiskey list and an okay beer selection.  Could use more independently owned craft beers (non sellout craft beers) and local craft beers on tap.  Local independent owners should support other local independent beer makers!

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Very good food and saw a great selection of beers. Servers were attentive. Inside could use a bit of a facelift but all in all a very good place.
Will come again"}
{"text":"A friend had a Groupon for this place and asked if I'd like to go with.  I hadn't been here before and, always willing to try a new place, I said sure.
I'm being a little generous with the stars as I don't think I'd return to Finnegans, but this isn't really my type of place. It's definitely more bar than restaurant and I suppose it's just fine for drinkin'.  The big turn-off was our choice of seats, straight line to the smoking patio so the stench of stale cigarettes wafted by every few minutes.  Not their fault but still not very pleasing.
The food was decent, but again nothing I'd really run back for.  The fish and chips came with one gigantic piece of cod which was different and the mussels were also a little different-almost like mussel noodle soup."}
{"text":"Being a \"First to Review\" whore, I convinced Hubby we needed to try the pub with the huge \"now open\" sign on our way out of Metro Center. Donna D. beat me to the punch, but we are very glad we went anyway. The interior is full of dark woods, with framed pictures, metal and mirrored beer ad signs, a mural, and antique instruments on the wall. The music was great, from The Smiths, REM, and STP to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. A band was setting up as we were leaving. It was quite busy, but we were still able to get a table right away at 9:00 on a Friday night. However, by the time we left, there were no tables to be had and the outside smoking tables were also completely crowded. The customers were totally eclectic, from older very well dressed Scottsdale types to skinheads. 

The drink menu seemed pretty standard, with Scotches, Irish whiskeys, bottled and tap beer. The menu was not huge, but let's hope that they do all the food as well as our dinner selections. They made a grand claim that they served the only authentic Shepherd's Pie in Arizona, and Hubby just had to see if they were full of it. Soon he was full of the best shepherd's pie he said he's ever had, made with lamb and champs. I had the fish and chips. The fish was not quite Rosie McCaffrey's and the chips were not quite as good as Rula Bula's, but it was all very very good. The piece of fish was about 12x5\" and super crispy, and the chips were potato wedges, well-seasoned and tasty. The tartar sauce was unusually tangy (and delicious) , but the cole slaw was served in a ramekin so small that it fit about a tablespoon's worth, but that turned out to be OK, since it was virtually tasteless. There were also burgers, sandwiches, cottage pie, and flat iron steaks on the menu, and a ridiculous sounding bread and butter pudding for dessert that we will be back to try (they were already out when we asked for it).

It was great to see a brand new place doing so well already, and Tim's will likely end up in our regular rotation of favorites.

UPDATE: We returned and had another good meal, and we noticed that a few things with my fish dinner had changed- less breading, more flavor in the coleslaw (mustard?), but the \"chips\" were a little soggy this time. We also got to try the bread and butter pudding. I'm not sure what to say about it- it's strange, for sure. A hot rectangle of cripsy on the outside and almost slimy on the inside bread pudding with a few pockets of raisins and a two note taste: hella sweet and bourbon. It was heart-stopping rich. The whole plate was drizzled with a slightly sweet thick butter sauce. It definitely  needed something else- maybe a little cinnamon."}
{"text":"i'm sorry. i love the hamburgers. and the shepard's pie. and while i had one bad experience a few years ago, i enjoy this place."}
{"text":"Was here on a Thursday night and there was live music! Bonus since that's usually reserved for Friday-Sunday at most places. 

My favorite Irish pub was the Johnny Fox's Public House, but it has since closed. :( So I began looking for a similar spot, although in no way does Tim Finnegan's come close in interior presentation as well as food, they do have a nice specialty drink selection and the staff is just as nice. 

The place is quaint with indoor as well as outdoor seating. The staff was not very attentive but were very friendly. I ordered the Irish Mudslide which was a delicious specialty drink and the small Shepherd's Pie. 

The lighting was relatively dark which makes it prefect for a casual date or a nice chill night out with friends. 

I would recommend this place, just remember to be assertive when you need something from the staff."}
{"text":"Went back to further explore the menu, and was happy with everything we ordered! Came during Happy Hour so all the appetizers and desserts were $5. We ordered 3 appetizers, and 1 dessert and we ended up stuffed, so $10 per person was not bad at all. After a couple of visits, my favorites are their desserts, the Bailey's Bread and Butter Pudding, and the Bailey's Tiramisu. Both are very delicious!

You can also request extra foam for your Guinness which is nice. And service has always been great here. No complaints, just wished they had a shuffleboard table and a real dartboard. They have a modern/high-end jukebox, and an electronic dartboard. They also have weekly events like trivia night, and karaoke."}
{"text":"Great place, nice atmosphere.  Very much like many of the pubs I have been to in Ireland.  The burgers are delicious, and at $5 on Monday, can't be beat.  Staff is friendly and they do pour the perfect pint of Guinness.

Another reviewer, Mary O. claims to have overheard the owner saying the anniversary raffle for the Ireland trip was rigged and gave the trip to his \"best friend\".  That is really interesting.  Since the winner is my husband, I was very surprised to learn he was best friends with owner.  So was my husband.  

We live nearby and go to Finnegan's multiple times a week.  During the month prior to the drawing we filled out an entry slip every time we went in.  We did NOT buy a raffle ticket.  If Mary Ol bought a raffle ticket, it wasn't for the drawing for the trip."}
{"text":"During a vacation, my friends and I decided to try to hit as many local places in town, and we were fortunate that this was the place we ended up at. 

First off, let me describe the food. For an appetizer we ordered the curry fries. Being from the Indian subcontinent, it was a must have, as I love English and Irish twists on Indian cuisine. It was so good! Perfectly cooked fries, and awesome curry. AWESOME curry dipping sauce. 

For my meal I ordered the Kalarney Chicken. To say the least, this was one of the best things I have had in my life. The presentation was gorgeous! Two perfectly cooked pieces of chicken sitting in a sauce upon a mountain of Irish mashed potatoes. It was delicious! Also, when I cut into the chicken, the chicken bled that beautiful brown grill color. I highly recommend this dish!

Lastly, Sonja, our waitress was really nice! She helped our next part of the part of the trip, and sat down at our table to talk to us for about a minute. It is not a lot, but, little things like that make a huge difference in my book. 

Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Brought my mom here today (Tues) for lunch.  Not busy at all but seeing the great reviews for fish & chips, I knew this was where I wanted to try something new. Service was great, server was sweet & accomodating. Cute place, music that was playing was alternative rock - it was fine for us but not everyone's cup of tea. 

For starters we ordered the corned beef & cabbage taquitos. We had both imagined the chewy goodness of cabbage & corned beef being the filling. No, the insides are in fact blended together. Gives it more of a pate type consistency. Will not order those again. 

We decided to order the fish & chips and a blue cheese burger to share. Fish & chips definitely did not disappoint. Blue cheese burger was ok, but they served it on a rather burnt bun. If it would've been just  mine, I would've sent it back, but my mom likes some char, so she was good letting me have the less burnt half. Did not come with much blue cheese, which was disappointing. It was not chunky either, probably about 1/2 of a teaspoon of blue cheese dressing. Burger was a decent size. 

Soda was flat. Ordered coffee, quite a few grounds, but taste was good.  

Will still go back for fish & chips!!"}

{"text":"Tim Finnegans is my favorite Irish pub they have awesome delicious food and drinks. .the wings, flat breads, sandwiches, burgers, fries and everything is good I have never had something that wasn't good from this place and I have been going for 5 years..they have happy hour every single day their bar tenders are really nice and always provide excellent service. .Rosie McCaffreys is a close second when it comes to Irish pubs."}
{"text":"Love the feel of this place. They do a nice job of not serving \"pub grub\". Artichoke dip was great but the Reuben taquitos could of been much better. My wife had the fish fry, which I thought was great. I had the authentic Shepard's pie and it was outstanding! Lots of Irish beers available."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim when we were being indecisive on a Sunday afternoon! It's laid back and really great atmosphere with wonderful service! Really good AUTHENTIC Irish food!!! The shepherd's pie is delicious and made with ground lamb! YUMMY! And the fish and chips are to die for (and on Fridays they are all you can eat for $15!) word to the wise, try the Left Coast Asylum!"}
{"text":"The only bar for Jets Fans in Arizona! They have the NFL Sunday Ticket, plus they're the official home for team USA Soccer. They always have amazing happy hour, specials, and great deals. 

The lamb skewers are so flavorful, and as I'm writing this review I'm eating their $9 Corned Beef & Cabbage dinner which is one of the best I've ever had! Traditional Irish Bar owned by a cool guy named Tommy. Definitely a regular here and i encourage checking it out sometime."}
{"text":"If it's lent or you're craving fish and chips then head over to TIm Finnegans for a black velvet pint and an order of AYCE fish fry for $13! that  can't be beat. Oh and it's good fish and chips, the sad part is that it's hefty so unless you're really just craving alot of fish, you'll only be able to handle one serving of fish and chips that it'll be too hard to stomach a second plate. The pub has character, and on Fridays usually later in the evening they have live music. Overall a good pub to hang out, have some fish and chips, drink some pints of black velvet (for me) and have a good time!"}
{"text":"I love Kristen. I love the food and the atmosphere. My coworkers and I come here often."}
{"text":"This review is from my previous visits- and going to another venue just to see JDV lit the fire under my ass to elaborate on my 'tip' from 4 months ago. After tearing Tommy a new one over the phone for allowing JDV to play in WestGate when he clearly does not belong there...lol, yeah, I tore him a new one...AS IF!!  
I wrote a freaking dissertation describing the horrible experience I had Saturday night & added to it Sunday morning...pretty severe and I'm surprised it is still a 'recommended review'!!! (Figured it'd be deleted).
Back to the task at hand. It's difficult to describe the TF's experience in regard to quality - BECAUSE my standards are ridiculously high- so what can you say when each time you visit, they exceed expectations. I'm dying to try the yummy food- but I go alone - so between worrying I'll overindulge and then the potential for needing a nap afterward....I live vicariously by checking out all the dishes & asking about them to customers(I am a self proclaimed pest. Yep.).
All I can say is: check it out. Plus if you yelp check in you get a free appetizer too. What's to lose?? (Also, the dudes behind the bar are pretty swank...nice eye candy and really nice--at the tables I'm pretty sure it's all female wait staff, no biggie but makes me happy that there's always a place for me at the bar)!!"}
{"text":"It was OK but nothing special. They pulled a good Guinness, but that was it. It took almost ten minutes to get a waitress to my table, and they were hardly busy (it was 6:10pm, and there were only 8 people in the restaurant). I ordered the lamb shepherds pie. I was hoping for chucks of lamb meat mixed with peas, carrots, and onion. What I got was a ground up stew. It tasted ok, albeit a bit bland, but there was no texture. It was like eating baby food. It is my observation that when a cut of meat is below par, you grind it. Will I go back? Maybe. The one plus was that it was within walking distance to my hotel, so I could enjoy many Guinness and not have to drive."}
{"text":"Need a divey Irish pub with good grub? Done! Don't let the four stars fool ya, this place isn't fancy or a gastro-pub catering to hipsters... This is a dark, loyal locals bar with everything you'd expect in an Irish pub... Friendly service, traditional dishes (and the American standards too) wooden bar, tables and chairs, trivia, live music and DAY DRINKERS. The only thing it has going against it is its location (Metro Center)... But after an 8oz portion of delicious Fish n Chips (all you can eat on Fridays) Jameson and a Guinness, you wont care about that anymore... See ya next Friday :)"}
{"text":"We met some long lost friends here last night.  Fast and efficient service.  The only issue was that music was to start at 9:00pm...we left at 10:30 and the music still had not begun.  At least we were able to chat with our friends but we were a bit disappointed as the sound check sounded great.  The fish sliders were super!  Potatoes skins needed salt.  I'd certainly go back."}
{"text":"Irish pubs are really my favorite places to eat, drink, and be merry.  Last Friday we knew we were meeting Tim S. for dinner at Cibo, so why not leave the 'burbs and go try some other places I have bookmarked on Yelp and just make a day of it?  

Tim Finnegan's was on the list and we had a great lunch.  We started with the mussels app which had some of the best broth I've ever had with mussels.  It was a little spicy, but not too much, and they put noodles in there which I've never seen before, but they soaked up the broth very nicely and made the meal more substantial.  I also really like the brown bread that came with it.  

Mr. M ordered the lunch portion fish and chips and I ordered the Rasher burger.  You know the food is good when there is very little talking, just eating.  That's what we did for the next 20 minutes, passing bites of fish and burger across our plates to each other and sharing the fries and green beans.  All perfectly done all the way around.  

The fish was nice and light with very tasty fries.  My burger was really exceptional and on par with the great burgers I've had at Fibber Magees and Skeptical Chymist.  Some of the best burgers I've had in this city were at places that don't market themselves as a burger joint.  

With a pint of Kilkenny, Guinness, and sharing one of Harp, our total before tax and tip was $36.23.  They have a great Yelp check-in deal and you can get the appetizer for free if you purchase two entrees.    

I loved the atmosphere with all the dark wood and small tables and booths.  Kristen took good care of us at the bar and we enjoyed her banter with some of the regular patrons.  I wish we lived closer to Tim Finnegan's, but now that we've given it a try, we'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"It's cool. It's dark. I like the music. The burgers and steaks are way better than I expected in a bar.

Great selection of beers, and the friendliest bartenders in town.

This time, I'm trying crab cakes, just to mix it up. They ought to go beautifully with this pint of Scottish Amber ale. :-)

Later : OH, yeah. The two crab cakes were tasty. Served with a flavorful aioli, salad and potatoes that were...like scalloped, but not creamy. I didn't look at the menu to see what they were called, but they were delicious!"}
{"text":"First time here for happy hour, probably my last. Only 1 bartender/server working who likes to socialize. People waiting for their first order and refills. Management needs to rethink their staffing if they want to increase sales or maybe they just don't care."}
{"text":"The food is great and pretty consistent, there are many standards they've had on the menu for years. The owners are very community oriented. The happy hour and seasonal holiday events are terrific. There is patio seating (for the, ick, smokers). They often have live music and a game night."}
{"text":"We had the fish & chips-lunch portion and the Corned beef and cabbage. Cabbage was cooked just right. Mashed potatoes and gravy were good. They have Guinness and smithwicks on draft along with other selections. Nice pub atmosphere.  High end scotch and whisky on the menu as well.  Booths, high top tables and tables in the back."}
{"text":"Chill environment, seat yourselves so you don't look like a dumba** at the front. Haha but food was great as well as the service. The night we were there it was open Mic night so there was live music. All in all, I'd like to come back and try another one of em burgers! :)"}
{"text":"We pulled up and the parking lot was empty and almost didn't go in! But we were very glad we did! We sat at the bar with our awesome bartender Harrison! He recommended my husband get Kilkenny Irish Cream and asked if he would like to try it with a drizzle of honey?! My husband is now obsessed!! Thanks Harrison...  
We got the Corner Beef & Cabbage Taquitos to start. My only complaint about this crispy dish is I'd like a little more seasoning. For our 2 entrees we got the small Fish & Chips (Cod was fried perfectly and so were the chips! Crunchy and yummy!) and the Sheapards Pie (I'm not a fan of Lamb but my husband loved it!) everything about this place was very Ishish in deed! We will be back! We hope to see more cars in the parking lot soon. But when we asked he said that is just how it gets in the summer!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place...i wanted this to be my new go to place...but it was disappointing for my first time. I will definitely return, but this review is based on this time.
Came for happy hour. Ordered a couple of drinks and some appetizers. As far as the food goes it leaves you wanting more out of it. Ordered a chicken and red pepper flatbread, the curry chips(fries) and the corned beef taquitos. Let me start with the taquitos: Where is the Beef?! It was all mashed potatoes inside no meat. The salsa verde is obvious canned sauce, and the only thing that stood out was the spicy mustard. Everything else was fried tortilla stuffed with tasteless mashed potatoes. This is whole point i wanted to come for those taquitos as they sounded so unique, but was i wrong. The flatbread had hard, dried chewy chicken. It was awful. The curry chips were ok, the curry sauce i liked but its curry sauce, you cant really mess that up.
Like i said i will come back and hopefully this time was just a bad day, because based on other reviews this place should be really good."}
{"text":"The fish and chips are amazing.  Service can be spotty, but overall it's really good.  I would definitely bring friends."}
{"text":"A solid neighborhood bar and the only Jets bar in all of Phoenix. If you're a misplaced Jets fan, be sure and check out the local Jets meetup group for Phoenix too, they meet here for every game. I don't especially love the food here, it's about as tasty as any other random sports bar in town, but the wings are a solid choice. They've got fish n chips, corned beef and cabbage, the usual Irish pub fare. 

I don't find myself in this part of town often, mostly for the football; that's football not föötbäll or however it's pronounced, although they do play the soccer games too. They've got a decent number of tv's and a large projection screen to broadcast the games, the wait staff is friendly and the drinks are decent priced. 

Honestly though, where else are you going to get to watch the best team in the NFL play with your closest friends? ;-)

Happy yelping Phoenix, are you ready for some football?!"}
{"text":"I had no idea Tim Finnagan's was changing locations but boy am I glad!! This is now less than a mile from my house and I could not be more excited about that. We had already loved Tim Finnagan's but I do have to say we were never a big fan of the location. It was actually a bit scary. NOW... its in a big busy complex, its beautiful inside and out, super clean and tidy, but a LOT smaller. But not in a bad way. I think it is actually the perfect size. 

So a little story on how I discovered this place was here. I was driving to my hair appointment and noticed something new opening so I drove closer and literally parked my car and sent a very excited video to all my friends and family in the neighborhood. We don't get a lot of cool stuff over here so I was stoked to spread the word. Then... 3 hours later I came and got a drink with a friend. Then... 2 hours after that I came and got dinner with my husband. THAT is how excited I was. My husband got the Fish and Chips. 2 Huge pieces of Cod layered over a pile of fries, a side of coleslaw, and a side of tartar sauce. I tried some and it was very good. The only complaint is we kept seeing the fish come out stuck together which made that part very soggy. Besides that very crunchy and flaky. I got the Ruben Sandwich. It was melt in your mouth good. I love that they didn't pile everything high to the sky. I could taste every thing, the coleslaw, the thousand island, the corned beef, right down to the buttery toast and white cheese. 

The feel of this place is more elegant than the last location with wine barrels to sit and more of a rustic decor all around. That night they had some great live music to set the tone. We cant wait to make this place one of our regular spots to hang, grab a beer, eat, and watch some soccer games!!"}
{"text":"My date took me to play mini-golf at Castles n Coasters, and we wanted to find a place to relax and have a drink.  We stopped in at Tim Finnegan's and sat at the bar, and four hours slipped away before we knew it.

Good atmosphere (typical Irish pub) and live music that was cool but not too loud for us to have a comfortable conversation.  Not too crowded, but the people there all were happy and having fun.

We had a few drinks, and we ended up ordering a turkey club and the brownie a la mode, both of which were tasty.

But the best part was definitely the service!  Harrison took great care of us and kept us laughing all night."}
{"text":"Small Irish Pub feel.  Food is great, but the service is on the slow side.  I ordered the cup of Bacon and cabbage soup and the Corned Beef and cabbage- it is St. Patrick's day or close enough...My only regret wS ordering the soup cup size instead of the bowl and the corned beef and cabbage lunch size.  Food was excellent!  The soup was slightly on the salty side, but went real well with the Irish Soda Bread.  The Corned beef and cabbage were tender and tasty and savory.  Ordered the Reuben and a Shepard's Pasty for lunch the next day.  If you can overlook the somewhat slow service, this place has great food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix on business last week. I absolutely enjoyed the friendly people and staff at this location."}
{"text":"Cheryl was a very good waitress and the food we ordered on St. Patrick's Day came out very quickly. To  bad they don't have any IPA's...."}
{"text":"Okay so my office is real close to this restaurant & I was working on. Saturday & my husband says let's go try this place out.... so we did!!! I am soooo glad we did!!  

Great Irish pub atmosphere & decor!

Our waiter was Shawn & he was very friendly & helped us with menu selections... so many great options on their menu!  

So we started with the mussels appetizer as another Yelper mentioned it. Oh my Goodness so damn good!  My husband said you can have all noodles but he ate more of them than I did!  Again you must get this appetizer!  I just ordered one to go it was that good!!!

For our lunch I had the Reuben excellent & the husband had the fish & chips.  Shawn our waiter recommends the chicken or pan seared cod entrees.   Will try those next time.  Oh yes we will be back!  Haven't even left here yet and thinking about dessert....

If you are in the neighborhood stop in!!!!  Enjoy my fellow Yelpers!!!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I went to T. F. today at lunch intent on corned beef and cabbage (me) and fried fish (her).  Waiter told us we could have the all you can eat fish for only 6 dollars more than the regular fish.  We took the regular fish.  What she got was either a very small piece of fish or half of a regular sized one.  Was fried up in a salty bit of batter.  Came with good cole slaw but there was only about two teaspoons of it.  Also came with some overcooked, limp and greasy french fries.  All for $9.00!!
My corned beef was good.Small portion again but good.  The cabbage was so salty that it might have been cooked in brine.  Fortunately there was only about 2 tablespoons of it.  It also came with mashed potatoes which were good but again super small portions.  My meal was also $9.00.  Iced tea was $2.25 and Harp beer (small glass) was $5.00.  Not too bad.
Chef needs to learn how big a serving size is.  He can't tell the difference between regular serving sizes and children's sizes.
HINT:  every day they have a different special.  That special is the big, that is to say regular size, for only a few bucks more.  So order the special even if it sounds big 'cause it isn't.  You'll actually save money because after we paid over $30 bucks we still went over to near by Carvers because we were still hungry.
Very sorry I didn't have the same experience that some of my fellow Yelpers did.
I guess this is a beer drinking place and food comes secondary."}
{"text":"This is the ONLY place for fish and chips!  I have tried other places around the valley and nothing compares. The atmosphere is fun and authentic with a wait staff that is friendly and knowledgeable. The burgers are good, and so is the flatbread....if you won't eat the fish. ;)"}
{"text":"Had a Reuben. Not a Reuben. Cole slaw instead of sauerkraut. Very little thousand island dressing. Marble bread, not a strong rye flavor. Corned beef was bland too. Very, very, bland. I'm from Omaha, NE., born and raised, where the Reuben was invented. I'm also Irish. This is more of what's called a Rachel Reuben, except it sticks with the slightly corned beef instead of pastrami or turkey. A Reuben should have a sour and tang, stink a bit. Disappointed. Why they ruined such a beautiful creation is beyond me."}
{"text":"TIM FINNEGANS 2.0! !
They are resurrected at 59th Ave and Bell Rd. In the shops on the Northeast corner. Same food you love, best Fish&Chips in the valley! 
Excellent food, excellent service, excellent selection of fine whiskey answer CLEAN FRESH SMELLING RESTROOMS!!"}
{"text":"I thought I had made quite the discovery while mini golfing last night when I saw that whatever crab house/fish tacos place here had gone under and been converted into an irish pub. Turns out there was that yelp event here. Well regardless I knew a couple of brews here would be the perfect accompaniment to the flask of scotch I took down at Castles n' Coasters.

I saw they feature 3 dollar Carlsberg's on tap and thought I was falling in love. Until they came. What is going on with the tapped beer here? I tried a Harp too, to see if it was just the Carlsberg, but both were strangely lacking their hearty flavor. I can't put my finger on it, because they weren't flat, but it was the poorest Carlsberg and Harp I ever had on tap. It also didn't help matters that the potato skins we ordered couldn't even stack up against Applebee's.

At least the had an \"Irish\" band playing. I could tell because my ears started to bleed green and orange. Is that supposed to happen? I don't think so, especially since half of the songs they played sounded more like they were from the band in the Swayze classic \"Roadhouse\" then befitting an Irish pub. Part of the problem just looks to be the natural acoustics of the space, but someone really needs to tell the house band that just because you can play loud enough to permanently make the entire pub crowd lose their ability to hear a violin, doesn't mean you should. They need to be able to play to the venue they have.

Timmy's also features a cast of entertaining, yet depressing characters, mostly of the mid-life crisis variety. There is Jig By the Server's Station with Your Heels Off Until Your Boob Falls Out Girl. We also got to see Take of Your Jive Hat So you Can Lick the Boobs of a Cardboard Cutout Beer Model Advertisement Guy. There was a brief cameo of I'm Gonna Wear My Gears of War Hoddie AND Hat Out Wherever I Feel Like to Make it Painfully Obvious How Much I Hate Human Interaction and Want To Get Home to Some Multiplayer Action Guy. There was the Sit as Close as Possible to the Band and Shout \"Chug!Chug!Chug!\" at Every Break Crowd. And of course who can ignore Lonely Guy Who Incessantly Claps at the Bar to Every Irish Anthem Played.

I have to give the place 3 stars for effort though, and for providing an escape in the metro center area that badly needed a dependable bar other then Applebee's. Even if the potato skins suck. At least I can now get blind stupid drunk for mini-golf. UYE?"}
{"text":"Always have a great time and stop in every time we are in Phoenix. I can only give it 4 stars because the too k Bass off tap a few yearss back, but still my favorite place to drink in AZ"}
{"text":"When we lived in Phoenix we were at the old spot at least once a week. They did a great job on the new location. The food was fantastic Sheppard's pie and fish and chips even better than I remembered. 
I'll be a regular every time I am in town."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since the new location opened.  All I can say is fantastic.  Have tried several different food items and after visiting Ireland and the UK several times this place is as authentic as it gets. Nicole is fantastic.  Jimmy is top notch.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Excellent place to hangout. Every item on the menu is awesome. I just love the pasties there and the curry fries. Love the beers and the live music is outstanding on the weekends."}
{"text":"Delicious food and a great atmosphere for family dining or hanging out with friends. It's just a really nice neighborhood Irish pub.

I had the rasher burger with chips, plus I ordered a side of their homemade curry sauce to go with it. It was all delicious! My husband had the fish n chips which he really enjoyed. My 9 year old daughter had the chicken pot pie soup which she really liked.

We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"After a long day sight seeing, we were in need of a pint and good food.  We drove around and saw dive bars and corporate restaurants ....and then saw Tim Finnegans. In we went and we were not disappointed...a taste of home!
This place is something different in USA..
Irish owned, the genuine artical.

We had the pan seared cod over chorizo...it was melt in your mouth good and we paired it with a pint of an Irish import Kilkenny .... that was only 4$... cheaper than we get in Ireland! 

The only thing we were disappointed in was absence of Jameson Rare on their menu...apparently it's not being made anymore...but the bar staff recommended something else that finished off the meal nicely! 

All in all...Tim Finnegans was wonderful...amazing food and drinks....offering great value and service. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and the Kilkenny Irish Cream Ale is fantastic!  I had the Kilkenny Chicken, my husband had the fish and chips, my FIL had the Bangers and Mash and my MIL had the Citrus Chicken Salad. Everything was fantastic, although my husband said the fish was a little greasy. The servings were generous and everything was very tasty. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Update as of 12/29/12:
Owner let me know the mobile menu/prices are getting updated soon, so that should help folks out.. Never know when you might get a spur of the moment to head out there, but don't know the menu by heart..

Might have to head over for a $5 burger before flying out of state in a couple weeks.. =D"}
{"text":"The ambiance and service were great. The seafood chowder and fries were awesome. The Reuben was poor. The corned beef was gristly and cut too thick and had coleslaw instead of sauerkraut  and Thousand island dressing."}
{"text":"Awesome! Really! What a great surprise. Many years ago, we came here with friends. I remember it being good, but we just never made it back. The Metro Center mall, and the shopping area where this pub is located, has really gone downhill and there are a lot of empty storefronts. But the pub has remained, and after having another meal, I can see why.

The food was so incredibly good! All of the entrees were beautifully presented. The seared cod was perfect - in fact, \"the best cod I've ever had!!\" was the comment. It came atop mashed potatoes which were described as \"absolutely delicious\" (and this from a mashed potato aficionado!) The shepherd's pie was traditional (lamb not ground beef!) and so tasty - yum, yum! The corned beef was cooked perfectly and very lean, served with tasty mash.

We didn't get a starter because we knew one of the decadent sounding desserts was in our future. And the Bailey's bread pudding - ahhhh, melt in your mouth awesome. 

Our server was friendly, good sense of humor and checked back with us frequently to make sure we were happy.

Awesome pub with food as good as any you'll find in a gourmet restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this hidden gem's  bear bones approach and low prices as it reminds me of an East Coast dive bar I once knew.  I'm not too keen on the attitudes and slowness of the bartenders, but really appreciate their drinks and bar food.  Most importantly I appreciate the live music and pretty eclectic playlist throughout the night.

I strongly suggest the barkeeps learn to be personable and friendly to ALL customers, regardless of whether we are someone you are \"surprised\" to see or who look different from the very average locals. All people like great music and a place to have a beverage  or meal, thanks! 

But, it looks shady when you have well drinks listed as four dollars on your website and I am being charged five dollars, or when you change my brother's ticket to show double the price he was supposed to be charged, and only change it when he calls you the next day. Or, when you offer a free appetizer with two entrée purchases, but I don't get offered that. Yikes!

I'll give it only two stars because customer service is essential to me, but if they clean up their acts, this could possibly shoot up to three. I think I'll speak to the management next time to avoid any further confusion about the importance of being personable and upholding scrupulous  business practices when working in the food service industry."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place many a time and wanted to stop in, but something always got in my way. 
Well, tonight was a special night and I finally got my chance to check out Tim Finnegans. 

As I walked through the bright red door I was hit with the authentic Irish smell of salty fish, not over powering, but just like I pulled into port. 

When I look around the bar I feel like I'm in an Irish antique shop, there is an old fashioned metal bike hanging on the wall with very old metal signage. It definitely has a neighborhood feel for me. This palce just gives off really good vibes to me. I would imagine that this is what an authentic Irish pub is like in Ireland.

The set up of the bar is very accommodating, they have a section that is lower than the regular bar which I assume is for little people and people in wheelchairs; and any place that is considerate of all their customers earns rave reiews in my book.

The LIVE music was great and a real treat. I like that they do this more than twice a week. 

I intereacted with two bartenders and four waitresses that night and I have to say everyone was very friendly and on the ball.

I'm definitely going back. If anything changes, believe me, you'll be the first to know!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. They have live bands on Mon, Thurs, Fri., and Sat. It's a very chilled and relax place. They have most of the popular Irish beers on tap. Nice place to go watch sports."}
{"text":"Loving this new location. Everything is awesome and fresh...both the food and the overall restaurant. The server was attentive, friendly and prompt. The happy hour deals are pretty good and the food was yummy!"}
{"text":"When I was younger I went on a trip to Ireland and we went to pubs all the time for dinner, this place took me back to Ireland with the food, look, and sweet greetings.

My whole family of 16 showed up and the service was spectacular. Sometimes when you walk into restaurants with a big group you can expect the waiter/waitress to be running around like a chicken with their head cut off.. not here. She handled it with grace. The food was also delicious. I got a blackened chicken sandwich and it was a dang good sandwich!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great happy hour and open until 2 every night. Melissa and Dave are amazing."}
{"text":"The food is top notch! Service is mediocre. WARNING! Do not go here on St. Patrick's day. $10 cover and for what???? Guy at the door says its for the band. WTH?? It's the same band they have on any other night that they don't charge for. Total ripoff. Then stand around for 30 min waiting on a drink and the bar tender gets it wrong!!"}
{"text":"Bottom line, Great food, Great service. Prices pretty equal to other places. I think the Guinness is just a little higher than others but, other than that on par with most Irish pubs around town and i've been to them all. (Yes, really). The two things i'll say bad about this place is: never will I ever go here on St. Patrick's day ever again. What a debacle it was when we went there when they were at metro center and they charge for soda water. I couldn't believe that they charged 50 cents for soda water with a $6 shot of vodka. Never have I ever been charged for a mixer. I've been to a lot of high end bars that you would expect this kind of charge at and still, never have I ever seen a bar charge for a mixer and soda water at that! unbelievable. The first time we went here after their move to 59th ave. ordered two vodka sodas and had ordered a soda water in between. saw the charge for soda water and thought, that's a little odd but maybe its what they do for just a soda water. The second try we ordered just vodka sodas. No plain old soda water and saw the same charges. Ridiculous! They did remove the charge when asked. Not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the experience. Food was really good, service was on key. We'll definitely be visiting again soon. It's so much nicer than the Metro Center location! Get your fries/chips well done! Nice to see this shopping center getting a new restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a St. Patty's day review.

They blocked off the parking lot. For some reason drinks were a tiny bit cheaper outside. Guinness was $5.75 inside & only $5 outside. Strange.

There was some band doing all sorts of cover songs. The song choices were great, but the band sucked! There was more live music inside which was a little more Irish authentic.

The people working here are hot. That's the guys, & girls. Yowza!

Only shitty thing about this place is if you try to order a soda or water you will get ignored. You're gonna have to ask 3-5 times before you get your non-alcoholic drink. Yes, I KNOW they make $$ off alcohol, but c'mon now... It takes 5 seconds to pour a soda.

The bathrooms became disgusting. That's too be expected & I'm not docking points for that. There are only 2 stalls though. Ladies, pee faster!

All in all this place isn't too bad. Decently pub like. I ended my night at Rosie's though & I think I'll skip Finnegans next year & go strait to Rosies."}
{"text":"Holy crap this place was delicious! I got the corn beef special it was one of the best meals I've ever had."}
{"text":"Tim Finnegan's Irish Restaurant and Pub is located in the 59th and Bell Road Shopping Strip anchored by the WinCo. (the restaurant is next to Cucina Tagliani) The decor is the typical Irish Pub, a little dark but homey. A little old fashioned with lots of dark wood and homey Irish things and a cool looking well stocked bar. The soft opening menu offers Modern Irish Foods, not so Irish Foods and Irish Favorites. On their website it shows that this restaurant (at old location) was featured on the PBS Check Please Arizona Restaurant TV Show. They say that they are Irish Owned and Operated. We were told that EVERYTHING is made by scratch in house. 

We started out by sharing the Wasabi Caesar Salad. We got a good size plate of fresh crisp romaine leaves that was tossed in a DELICIOUS dressing laced with parmesan. The salad was also topped with flavorful very crisp croutons. Delicious salad!

For dinner I tried the Fish and Chips. There is a choice of size platters either small 4oz or large 8oz. (both were reasonably priced) I went with the large. Everything on my plate was great. I received a lightly battered meaty juicy cod with a thin shattering crisp coating. The tarter sauce was well made and delicious. The generous portion of fries were hand cut and seasoned just so and the Cole Slaw was really delicious. It was a little wetter than I like but still it was really delicious and seasoned just so.

My husband tried the Lamb Shepard's Pie. It looked awesome with those piped potatoes on the top. My husband it it was very very good!

Our server was phenomenal. The owner or manager also welcomed us and checked on us.

This experience was a very solid 4.5 stars. I have to hold back on the 5 to see how things play out.

Irish eyes and Non-Irish eyes are smiling. This is a Great New Edition to this part of town. Thanks for opening here!

A new spot for my local rotation."}
{"text":"The selection is terrific and the taste is superb. If you love cod this is the place for you. It is served without the deep fry and the french fries taste like they do on the streets of London served in the cones. The staff is friendly but it is Irish so you sort of expect that. Not much of a wait and they served everything quickly and with a smile."}
{"text":"OMG! Get the bread pudding!  Its AMAZING!!!!!  Also got the corned beef, wasn't the best I've ever had.  But the one man band is really good, reminiscent of Jack Johnson.  Our server Roxanne was really sweet too."}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times in the last 2 years and always had a good time, so when I heard they were having an Open Bar for New Year's Eve I jumped at gathering a few friends to celebrate here. I called ahead to see if we could purchase tickets ahead of time or see if we can make a reservation. They said they were expecting a huge crowd so just to show up really early. Come New Year's Eve night my friends and I get there at about 845ish. Band wasn't on yet, there were still a few tables open abd the bar wasn't crowded at all. The hubby ordered some fish and chips to munch on with our beers. Wasn't impressed. Nor was I in the past when I tried their food other nights, so I didn't have high expectations anyhow. Open bar was just $20 for ladies, $30 for guys. It was well worth it!! Included all draft beer and a selection of shots. We definitely had a great time here and took advantage of the open bar. Bartender even let us know when there was a cab available outside when we were good and drunk. The bar never got too crowded and crowd didn't get too crazy - aside for a few girls who threw up all over themselves in the restroom. But you know everyone's having a good time when the ladie's room gets backed up and no one cares because we're all just having a good time chitchatting with each other - cat fight free."}
{"text":"Great food...fresh beer and great service on a busy Saturday night!  The band was real good too!"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times and the food and service are terrific. They have a great beer selection and several ciders. There are plenty of options for everyone on the menu, and when they have Irish Breakfast as their special it is the best in Arizona."}

Jalapeno Ranch dressing is house made and is great with the fries! 
Roxy, our server, was friendly and fast! Great service!
Tom the owner is so nice!! Always enjoy a night out at Tim Finnegan's!!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I will definitely be a repeat customer! 

I ordered the turkey burger which is something I never get, it was good. Got the bread pudding for desert, it was good.

Our server, Roxann was on top of it and provided great service!"}
{"text":"This is a perfect Irish pub - spacious but cozy, lovely with a hint of divey, great selection of beers, great service, live music, and excellent fish and chips.  

St. Patty's Day is coming up fast (and on that day, this place is mobbed - which might be fun!), so if you're feeling Irish, this is one of the few places in AZ that makes my little East Coast drinkin' heart feel at home!  Check out the live music on a Friday nights (there's a calendar with artists online).  

The only possible downside is the location - but that makes it all the better, if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Fish and chips are the same great quality as the old location but a complete letdown that there's no more AYCE fish fry on Friday.  Drove an hour for nothing.  I miss the old menu from the previous location.  The manager and wait staff were very apologetic and hopefully they'll incorporate the popular Friday special into the new location."}
{"text":"Great food! Awesome owner. I had the Reuben sandwich and the corned beef was so flavorful and tender. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Went for HH yesterday.  This is an pub type atmosphere.  Lots whiskeys and beers on tap.  Irish menu with Shepard's pie, and fish and chips, cornbeef and cabbage, along with burgers and  salads too.  I had the fish and it was excellent crispy battered deep fried cod.  Just the way I like it.  Another at our table had the corn beef and cabbage and was not disappointed.  2 steak salads were also a hit.  Overall everything was excellent.  Just don't come in ordering foo foo drinks, it's a pub.
We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Although I've been to Tim Finnegan's a few times before, my most recent visit was because I bought a Groupon. I had the small fish (it was a Friday) and a couple of beers. The server seemed new but she was very sweet. I will come here again."}
{"text":"Tim Finnegan's is a badass Irish pub & probably my first choice to grab some beers in the Ghetro-center area. If you're looking to go there for drinks & entertainment, then you'll have a good time. 4 or 5 stars for the pub environment.

For vegetarians, this place gets 2 stars for the food. For non-vegetarians, my fellow diners also have not been impressed with the food.

So to summarize: eat elsewhere and then head to Tim Finnegan's for drinks & entertainment."}
{"text":"This was our first time going to this place, we've been to other Irish pubs and loved them. This place, made you feel like you were not in Arizona. It had that vibe of Ireland, the live music, the rugby on TV that would make you question if you're really a man cause of how tough those guys are. The staff was friendly and the service was okay. Some food items took a little longer to get out than they should have and even some drinks took longer than they should have. The appetizers were delicious and during happy hour makes them reasonably priced. I personally ate the Rasher Cheese Burger, visually, it was a good sized burger! One that makes you question how you're going to fit it in your mouth to take a bite. Taste wise, it was very bland and a little burnt. I ordered medium and it came back well done (that's probably why it was burnt a little). So that's why I gave 3 's. For the wait times for food and drinks and the flavorless burger."}
{"text":"Is this an Irish pub or a Scottsdale club? Having to tell over each other because of the loud hip hop is pretty annoying. Drinks are cheap."}
{"text":"Seriously the best service ever! The food is delicious and they have the best Guinness ever! The best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I have a habit of always ordering potato salad and shepherds pie if they are on a menu. It's just my odd thing to do.

With that thought in mind can you guess what I enjoyed for dinner tonight? Yes it was a lamb shepherds pie. And it was just what I hoped for - subtly different than any before. The key difference was that the 99% was lamb, with a few carrots and peas thrown in. The lamb was good but a little dry,

Hubby is the same about ordering fried cod as I am about the potatoes and pie mentioned above. He had the dinner size portion and the piece of fish served was large. The dish was accompanied by fries and coleslaw.

What I wish Finnegan's did different was seating. We had to wonder around looking for table, it was like the parking lot at the mall on Black Friday. People circling around looking for the elusive parking space before any one else sees it. In the end we hovered near a guy paying his check at the bar and grabbed his spot when he finally decided to stop playing with his phone and leave.

Finnegan's had plenty of staff and there was minimal waiting for food and drinks. We will be back.

Our tab with food, one beverage and tip cane to $41."}
{"text":"Our favorite place!  Who knew I liked corned beef and cabbage. None better anywhere! Fish and chips right up there! Can't go wrong no matter what you order!  Staff is fantastic! Don't forget to order a Guinness and always tip generously !"}
{"text":"Found this pub on yelp and are so glad we did! Very good fish and chips on Fri night and the pan seared cod was awesome! ask for Morgan B.  She had all the menu secrets! Back again asap."}
{"text":"I really love this place! 
Yes it is in a strip mall-what isn't? 
But, when I was sitting inside listening to the great live music and drinking my Guinness I felt like I was back in Michigan or somewhere back East where old school Irish pubs and hole-in-the-wall bars are much more prevalent than trendy clubs and lounges. 

Great service! 
The place is huge and has your general bar food and full bar. I have yet to try anything besides their beer but I am sure I will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"Went back to listen to Shay Veno perform. What a great place to hang out in the neighborhood! (although the music started about 45 minutes later than was advertised, which wouldn't be AS big of a deal if it wasn't a weeknight...)

BTW, the corned beef and cabbage taquitos are really good!! 

Definitely worth keeping an eye on this place...  I plan to go again..."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The wasabi Caesar salad had no trace of wasabi and the dressing was too thick. The shepherds pie came with a soup spoon but I have no idea why; there was no gravy at all and the mashed potatoes were dry and cold."}
{"text":"Lovin' the new pub!  I've been there three times in the last couple of weeks and have to admit that I'm hooked. Where else can you get Strongbow on tap, and The Pogues, Dropkick Murphy, The Tossers, and Flogging Molly on the box?!! The food isn't half bad either!

They have a phenomenol HH with apps at half off and drink specials that actually make it reasonable. My first trip came in at $25 for three apps and 4 pints. We sampled the wings, some weird little sausage rolls, and the corned beef and cabbage taquitos (which I must say were quite tasty in a really unexpected way). The best part was that Donelle (ask for her if you are there), lined me up with the second pints 2 minutes before the prices went up to save me a little moola!

They have live music three or four nights a week, pub trivia when there is no band and sunday afternoons they do Seisiun (think fraggle rock with Irish or celtic instruments). Check out their website for details shows http://www.timfinnegans.com/index.htm

This place is comfortable, way not pretentious, and may just be my new home away from home!  Slainte  : )"}
{"text":"love this place, great layout and ambiance, plenty of parking and the food was great.

couple of suggestions
the night we were there there was a guy and a guitar, loud and not connected to the crowd.
have the bartenders learn how to pour guinness correctly, mine was fast poured and no crown on the pint"}
{"text":"Nice pub with a cool atmosphere! The drinks are unique and strong! Definite must try for a unique experience! Great service with outdoor seating and some nights they have live bands!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken wings which were, eh.  The corned beef and cabbage taquitos were disgusting.  They tasted like refried bean taquitos, and the filling looked like refried beans.  The fish tacos are wonderful, though. It's all about the Pub here! Five stars for the bar! Great whiskey and scotch selection. I mean they have The Balvenie 15 year! 

The decor: warm pub atmosphere"}
{"text":"OMG, so good! I've been here twice to sample their food and every time it has been amazing! Today we did the half off appetizers for happy hour and tried five different varieties, and again, SO GOOD! Great service both times as well. We will return!"}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for an Irish pub I go to Tim Finnegans. Guiness on tap, of course, my favorite Scottish ale, Kiltlifter, and amazing food make this a great place to stop with friends. Live music will fill the joint and a good game will bring a noisy crowd, or if you want a quiet evening drop in on a quiet Monday and enjoy a Dirty Kilt amongst the dark wood interior with the friendly staff. 

I like Finnegans and all its moods and I know you will too."}
{"text":"These guys are great! A diamond in the rough. Say hi to Tom and Jimmy behind the bar grab a proper pint and get some authentic Irish food. If I lived closer, this would be my neighborhoof spot. I hope they open another spot soon."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it here. It was pretty chill for a Friday night but probably the best atmosphere of any Irish Bar I've been to in The Valley. The Garlic Fries KICK ASS!!!!. Holly did some great acoustic covers....will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Delicious food & Carlsberg on draft. My mouth is watering at the thought. Scrumptious! :)"}
{"text":"Been here 2 times in the past 60 days, and I am here to tell you that there's a lot to like about Tim Fiinnegan's;

1. Nicely decorated Irish-style pub/restaurant.  For the Metrocenter area, this is 5-star.
2. Friendly, competent, smiling staff.
3. Kid/family friendly (ok, during happy hour and early dining hours, admittedly)
4. Very reasonable prices
5. GREAT Happy Hour prices
6. Solid, if not spectacular, food; very good portions

Need I say more?  Go to Tim's, a good, honest restaurant providing value in an otherwise underwhelming neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love this place. Not quite as homey as their last location, but the service and quality is unmatched."}
{"text":"Came in last Friday night, a little after 9 or so, to meet up with some friends in town from Denver. They were in for just the weekend and had suggested the place but I was definitely eager to check out a \"new, to me\" pub that's on my side of town. 

Upon entering, it seemed to have the right feel and charm to it. Plenty of beer mirrors and signage, decent whiskey selection, Carlsberg on tap, and that dimly lit pub feel. After greeting my friends and grabbing a stool at the bar it all kind of stopped there.  Once I flagged the bartender down, he flung a coaster at me and kind of gave me a blank stare.  I was fully prepared with my order but was kind of taken back by the \"what the hell do you want\" attitude on my first drink of the night. As far as I could tell, there were three others at the bar top when I sat down, with one just having tabbed out next to me. Ok, slow night but come on man, what's with the sour attitude. Got my drink, brushed it off, and continued on with socializing with my friends and enjoying the atmosphere, until another friend sat next to me at the bar top. He received the same treatment, a Frisbee toss of the coaster and a \"what?\" from the bartender. As he walked away to get my friend's drink, I explained how he did the same thing to me and it must be how they do it here. \"Keep Going sure It's Grand\"

What could have possibly be the savior for this place that night was the open mic gig playing in the far corner across from the bar. She belted out some Adele covers and green day song or two that sounded awesome!  Huge props to her for continuing to play with only a hand full of people in the bar on a Friday night. 
Once again trying to get service from one of the two bartenders talking in the corner with each other was like pulling teeth. After begging for another round, we decided our second drink was enough and we'd take off to another spot.  We had even offered to by the singer a drink because she sounded awesome, never got that one either. 

3 Stars because they had a live singer... 0 Stars for the service. 
However, because I think I would real like this place under different circumstances, I'd give it another try and hope for a different bartender."}
{"text":"As regulars on a Friday night I would expect some consistency. That is the case with the food. Always outstanding. However, service has been very lacking the last 3 maybe 4 times. I know that you are are bar. My family owns one too.. this doesn't mean you employ people that obviously do not care for your customers. Slow to come take an order and chasing them down for drinks or waiting 30m to pay the bill with not a drink in hand. Im sure you might get a few that just leave. The food is the only thing that saved this review from not being a 1 star.
Also, on a side note. If you have regulars that show up every Friday for the fish fry because it is good. Maybe you should let them know next week we will be charging $10 a person at the door regardless for St. Patty's day. Or not even letting us in to place to go orders now that we showed up and obviously are not going to pay to get in so we can pay to eat. THAT'S A ZERO STAR!
We will have to think about coming back. Again your food keeps us coming, but the service is making us think twice about it."}
{"text":"Great beer, authentic food, awesome atmosphere. Happy hour is 4pm-7pm Monday - Friday which includes $1 off Irish draught beers, $4 wines & wells, $2.75 domestic bottles & about 7 different appetizers. Also, there's always something going on during the evenings .. Tuesday - Trivia, Wednesday - open mic, live music on Friday/Saturday, & karaoke on Sunday. Although smaller than the old location, it's much more clean & updated."}
{"text":"You can eat fish and chips is very tasty comes with coleslaw the beer here is ice cold I would recommend it to anyone"}
{"text":"Overall its a great environment. The ambiance reminds you of a cabin atmosphere and the drinking hole is were all the entertainment happens. Bartenders are friendly and the menu is nothing to sleep on. If either looking for some cold beers or good food this is definitely a spot you come to on this side of phoenix. Evenings are a cult following of industry workers from the restaurants and bars around the area good music and great lighting."}
{"text":"Seriously first experience watching a soccer game at an Irish pub and what a way to get broken with the champions league finals ! I got there just in time for the match to begin and found a corner spot to enjoy my blonde Guinness , fish and chips and a bacon cheeseburger ! The staff was friendly and accommodating. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Went to Tim Finnegan's for happy hour tonight. Service was EXCELLENT, was served a Carlsberg and wings within 5 minutes of being seated. Food was well above average pub grub (I've been to their brother pub in Scottsdale, the Skeptical Chemyst and knew what to expect). Great appetizers (Wings, PEI mussels, short rib sliders, crab cakes and a whole bunch of great flat breads) that are half price daily from 4-7 pm! Great selection of imported beers on tap and in bottles, as well as whiskeys. Good pation and good sports viewing throughout. I'd give it a \"5\" but I'm a tough grader, lets call it 4 1/2 and if they continue to impress, we'll see!"}
{"text":"Went on Friday after work. It was pretty crowded. For my taste it was too dark. Our waitress helped me choose a beer and it was a good choice. The burger was pretty good, however it wasn't what I ordered. I am so used to not tasting strong blue cheese when I order a blue cheese burger, and we were busy talking, that I did not realize I got the wrong burger by mistake until about halfway through I bit into a jalapeno. Turns out it was entered wrong but by then I was not ready for another whole burger. The waitress got it comped and she was really apologetic. I think with more light I would have noticed it right away. Overall it is a 3.5 that would be OK to meet somebody at but maybe not my first choice."}
{"text":"Best Irish Pub in all of Maricopa County, probably in the entire state! None of the other pubs I've been to feel as authentic and lack the atmosphere of Finn's, nor does the food at any of the others seem to stack up against theirs. They also have an excellent whiskey selection, something lacking at many of the valley's pubs and bars."}
{"text":"Great pub! We stopped in here by chance and I'm glad we did. We had just eaten dinner so we were just looking for a good spot for drinks. The atmosphere was great. We enjoyed our night so much we came back in the afternoon for some grub. Tasty food, solid drinks, friendly staff... I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is the best food outside of Ireland. I had the Shepherds pie & my husband had the the seared cod with mashed potatoes & green beans. The food was outstanding, piping hot   & great tasting as food should be, great service from Alex. Fast friendly & communicative.
Met Tom the owner who is friendly & knows how to run a great Irish pub....he greeted us like we were life long customers....now we are! ah that's because he's one of the great ones from the auld country. If you have not been here it's a must. They have a great menu with a choice of two sizes of main course items, so whether your hungry or thirsty, this place is a great choice. The Kilkenny is a great beer."}
{"text":"Great craft beer selection..crabcakes are very yummy and loaded with crab...the wasabi aoli is a nice accompaniment. ..definately has that Irish Pub feel!!"}
{"text":"LOVED the food!  We finished dinner as the live music was starting.  Next time we will come later to enjoy!  My husband had the all-you-can-eat fish.  It was very tasty and the fish was cooked perfect.  Nice big pieces of cod that were firm and NOT mushy.  I had the lamb shepherds pie.  It was FAB!  We also got a FREE order of Chicken wings to take home, just for doing a Yelp check-in.  We ate those later that night and they were GREAT!  Can't wait for our next visit!  Oh, and don't forget the on-tap Guinness...Yummmm!"}
{"text":"If your in the area this place is a must. I travel and eat out a lot. I can honestly say this is the best burger I have ever had anyplace. The fries are also fantastic, and I don't really like fries. But they hand cut them. Draft beer is import only but all others are offered. The location is weird. It's in a strip mall that seems under construction but if you can find this place your will be pleased. Service good too. Will be back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star Irish pub experience. Food is pretty good! I've been here several times. I've had a few of the burgers, shepherds pie, mussels, lamb skewers, and the wings. All of which were tasty choices, I was not disappointed. They have a nice selection of rotating craft beer taps. Guinness of course is done correctly, just a perfect creamy pour every time I've ordered it. The whiskey selection is decent too, and is modestly priced. I've never had any service problems. Live music is a great addition, and we have been to the trivia night on Tuesdays a few times as well, which is a lot of fun. We haven't been to trivia since it switched our from Geeks who Drink to whoever the new provider is, but the word is they are still doing trivia. Some of the entrees come with a side of soda bread that is just amazingly delicious. We were able to purchase a loaf of this bread a few times on our visits. Its worth asking if you try it and like it."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere! Much better location than their other location. True authentic Irish fare! From the drinks to the options on menu. I had fish and chips and other person had Shepard's pie. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"What a fun Pub for a chill place to hang out in. The food is amazing! Great selection. The music after 9:00 pm turns into more of a up beat music."}
{"text":"In the mood for a pint of Guinness on a Tuesday night ... decided to give this pub a try.  My friend found the crab cake appetizers to be very good.  I found the Corned Beef dinner to have a different texture from fresh-cooked corned beef at home; we decided it had to do with pre-prepared and pre-packaged corned beef.  The taste was good, however.  On a week night it was hard to gauge how popular this place is; not many groups, about 4 besides us, at Happy Hour."}
{"text":"So much better at the new location. Still a little pricey for what it is though. They have some great live music from time to time. Went and saw Jason Devore from Authority Zero here and had a good time."}
{"text":"I used to play on a Coed indoor soccer team that was sponsered by this bar and that is when I started to go here. If you are into authentic Irish bars then you absolutely must stop in. It is in a kind of hidden corner but once you walk in you will realize how charming it is. Even the bartender is actually Irish! They have $3 Carlsberg all day every day and other great Irish beers and ciders on tap. As far as food goes I have only had their fish and chips but it was delicious. We stopped in last Saturday night because they are the only Official US Soccer bar in Arizona and we wanted to watch the game. We were pleasantly surprised with the live music they had that night. It was really great and I think we will be going more often now!"}
{"text":"Very genuine Irish bar. In Ireland, people don't go around playing fiddles all the time, so I'm OK with this place not having had that when I visited :) 

As far as the location, it has plenty of parking, it's very roomy, decorated well, clean & the staff is helpful & friendly. 

I went there to watch a UFC game & I was lucky to get there early enough to get a seat at the bar, right in front of the TV :) They also show soccer games, which you'll be hard pressed to find in many places. 


The food portions are big, at least for me, lol. My friend had the Sheppard's pie & he went on about it for days, so I guess it was THAT good. They also have plenty of options on draft & were willing to give suggestions for mixed drinks. I don't remember what the drink I had was called, but it was yummy! Great bar tender."}
{"text":"If you don't want to get freaked up, don't go there this week, they are closed for floor maintenance. Their ignorance cost us 2 uber rides and half an hour in Phoenix sun. Asked them to update status on yelp and website so that this won't happen to anyone else, but they haven't yet. So a friendly warning to anyone else yelping for fun this weekend you are on wrong page now, hit the back button n move on or call them to check their status. Happy holidays....."}
{"text":"Their corn beef and cabbage is delicious. My husband and I came here on St. Pattys Day and it was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"Went with a group because it was close to hotel. The service was good to start it took at least an 45 minutes to get food. When food came it was cold. Looked good but frys were cold and sandwhich were all cold. Would not go back considering the place was not busy. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Last night was my first time here. I heard it was good Irish food so I decided to give it a try along with six other friends. We arrived at 8:30 and there were a couple of occupied tables but it was mostly empty. 

Our server seemed completely overwhelmed by our party of seven. She was very nice, but I don't think she was having a very good night. Her memory was pretty bad last night as well. We were there for the food though so let's talk about that...

We tried starting with a few appetizers. I say we tried starting off with the appetizers, but everything came out at the same time. I HATE that! Lamb skewers, chicken tenders and pretzels with cheese. All were very good, but the homemade pretzel was probably the best one. The flavor was just right. I hate nothing more than an overpowering pretzel flavor that takes away from anything else, this one was perfect and the cheese sauce was fantastic. The chicken tenders were very good as well with what I think was a delicious beer batter coating. Lamb skewers had good flavor and were served with a mint yogurt sauce and a small salad...they could lose the salad, kind of pointless. 

Moving on to dinner...I just ordered another appetizer, the pasty. You can choose from beef, chicken, shepards pie or veggie. I chose the shepards. They really didn't do much for me, in fact they would have been pretty disappointing if it wasn't for the gravy they are served with. 
Two people in my group ordered corned beef and cabbage and loved it, two people ordered the fish and chips and said it was pretty good and one person ordered the black bean burger and said it was very good. So all in all, not bad, but it sounds like the corned beef was the winner. 

As for cocktails, stick with something simple or drink beer. They make a pretty horrible martini! 

In the end, they have decent Irish food but if you want to enjoy an appetizer first, you might want to hold off on ordering your entree because the server might not understand the concept! 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"The barkeep was awesome! He made excellent recommendations for whiskey and service was fast and friendly"}
{"text":"What a great find. We came for spring training and found Tim Finnegans. We came on a Sunday night during happy hour. One of the best happy hours around. The food was fantastic. The lamb skewers were to die for. The service was fantastic. We have told all of our friends to go to Tim's when they come to Phoenix. They and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time that I had Shepherd's Pie. It was good and filling. They told me that real shepherd's pie is made with ground lamb; that's how they make it here. It went well with a pint of Guinness. I will definitely come back and try the corned beef and cabbage. 

Bartender was cool, service was great, food was good, and beer was cold. I'm a fan."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I typically go for happy hour with the girls, but I drug my husband there last night. They have wonderful beers on draft, and the food is a nice change from typical \"bar food\".  My husband and I had several Smithwicks, which were cold and were delivered in a timely manner. I had the steak salad. It was a little fatty, but the dressing was awesome. Ben had the sliders, which were moist and tasty. Our server was friendly and prompt. I only have 2 small issues with this place: first, I like to sit on the patio, but every time I go there, I have to go inside and ask for service. After I ask, I usually have great service, but I would prefer to be served without asking. Second, the crowd is sort of strange. I love eclectic people, but every time I go there, there are people who try to have these strange, conservative-laden conversations with me. Not that I am intolerant of people's views, but I am having a convo with the people I came with, and it feels strange to be randomly interrupted by strangers. Not the bars fault, just an observation."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We went there to celebrate St. Patrick's day. It was busy but the servers were all very friendly. The food was great too. The garlic fries and corned beef and cabbage were amazing. The bread pudding was the best I've ever had. This is my first review of a restaurant on Yelp but I just had to comment on it. You must try this place!!"}
{"text":"We haven't been to this bar in many years.  We went a few days ago and had a great experience.  I ordered the southwest chicken wrap and it was soooo good.  It has grilled juicy chicken, jalapenos, lettuce and some kinds of cheeses etc...  It was moist and just hot enough to keep me happy.  I loved every single bite.  My friend ordered a shepard's pie and he too was super impressed and devoured it.  The service was fantastic, prompt, friendly, and gave great beer suggestions for my friend.  I was surprised that they had a good Sauvignon Blanc, and I am a very picky wino, so I will definitely be back for that.  The music was not too loud, just right thankfully, and the people all seemed pretty normal-type, just in there to relax, unwind, be friendly, and have good food, drink, and service."}
{"text":"Oh Tim, oh Tim. You let us down today. A day after St. Paddy's day with an amended menu. Whoever heard of such a thing? Ok, but at least you should do well with what's on that amended menu. We ordered the garlic chips- fish and chips and a hamburger, and three glasses of wine. The burger was awful with barely edible wilted lettuce and the fish was 3/4 fried dough and minimal cod inside. Wine pours were small for $7. Grand total of $62. Not my idea of a lunch special. The one star was for the wait staff who were indeed friendly. Sorry, it'll be awhile before we return."}
{"text":"We've had several items on their menu. Faves are the fish n'chips, the shepherds pie and their wings. The fish has a wonderfully crisp shell and its tender and delicious. The tartar is creamy and flavorful, the fries delicious! The shepherds pie is made with lamb (rare in Phx!) and the wings are hearty and crave-worthy. The bread pudding is amazing & highly recommended! Fantastic Irish brews on tap too! Try it, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"Best Irish fare in Glendale!  Gorgeous bar that has to be seen to be believed (the heart of this pub).  Mitch, our bartender/waiter was friendly, fast, and on-the-spot with everything we ordered.  The Shepherds Pie was perfectly cooked, and perfectly portioned.  This is our first visit to the new location, and we are very impressed.  We will be back! 
P.S.  This place has the BEST bread pudding of any we've tried!"}
{"text":"This is my first trip since the move from the old location and met up with a friend. Pleased that it's around the corner from my house and I hope they have staying power like the old location but there wasn't too much to be pleased with for Happy Hour today. A surprisingly quiet atmosphere.  Beers were cold, Spinach Artichoke dip was good, pretzel dips were good but pretzel was chewy.  The service was SLOW.  It was not a crowded Happy Hour and not sure why it too more than 5 minutes each time to get an order in for my first and my next round and closing my tab.  It makes it difficult not to walk into Popo's next door for the next happy hour trip to this parking lot...
I hope I just caught a bad day."}
{"text":"After a 10-mile bike ride to work I stopped by Tim Finnegan's last night to grab a bite to eat - I'd been here before with some friends to sample the appetizers at happy hour, and was intrigued by their selection of food featuring interesting twists you wouldn't expect, like corned beef & cabbage taquitos! Whoa!! I knew this place would have something to satisfy.

After working up quite an appetite, I ordered the Irish breakfast - sausages, white and black pudding, toast, eggs, bacon, tomatoes, beans. WOW! It came on a huge square plate, covering the entire thing. Looks like a lot of food, but was just the right amount. The 'over-easy' eggs were cooked PERFECTLY - not your usual runny-and-barely-done mess, but exactly how I like them. I try ordering over-medium at other places but it always comes out runny. I'm really particular about my eggs, and it's relieving when you get someone that knows how to cook them right. The toast was hefty and tasty, bacon and sausage delicious. I swore off black pudding after trying it once at the Dubliner but figured I'd give it a try again - completely converted!! I know this is weird, but it reminded me a tiny bit of mincemeat pie - savory and spicy. The white pudding was great, too. 

Service was great, from previous descriptions I may have had Tom (?) - we sat at the bar and he was fast and direct. Even the cook came out to ask us how our food was! 

I had a great time. Like I posted on my Facebook page, \"I think that's the closest thing to a holy experience I've had with food for a while!\" :D"}
{"text":"great atomsphere, music, food, and beer.  Here watching the NCAA Hoops Tourney.  Bookmark this place!"}
{"text":"Finally back in Phoenix with the hubby for a week or two and I have to drive up north to visit with a friend in from Buffalo to talk about networking and marketing. I need some dinner and a beer before I head to my little schmoozefest and remember that the recent Yelp Elite event (that I missed because I was out of town) was held at this place. 

We find Tim Finnegans and decide that we want to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful night air after my month in the frigid northeast.  We walked in to get menus and I noticed that the place seemed huge, but I walked through and went outside so I didn't get to see much.

Outside there are numerous shiny new wooden tables with benches at which to sit.  Our waitress meets us outside and quickly takes our drink orders.  We peruse the menu for our choices, and by the time she comes back are ready to order.

We chose chicken wings as an appetizer, because that's how we roll.  The wings were meaty and pretty good.  If I were reviewing only them, I would probably give them 3.5 stars.  No Franks, but the sauce was a good combination of hot and vinegary.  They could have been a little crispier.

I ordered the Shepherds Pie, which claims to be the only authentic pie in the valley.  I'm not sure what makes it authentic, but my guess is the lamb.  I've never seen it offered as a lamb dish before.  Unfortunately, I was too full from the wings and couldn't take more than a few bites.  I'll eat the leftovers later, because from what I tasted this meat and potato dish was pretty yummy.

I'd give the whole restaurant 3.5 stars and round it up to 4 for the willingness of the owners to open an original restaurant in the land of chains.  I would definitely go back and try it again if I have time while I'm here."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review about this place yet! I absolutely love this place and it totally is overlooked by a lot of people around the area. It's a in a run downed area by the metro mall, so it's not a surprise that people just by pass this place. Hell, I use to! But not anymore. 

I go there quite a few times now, or as much as I can. It's a great spot for some live music! Hanging out with friends! Beer! And food! It really is a great little hole in the wall bar. I love this Irish bar. And they're certified to pour the perfect Guinness!"}
{"text":"The old location used to be way better. They lost some of their charm with the new location. Beware of the shepherd's pie. They no longer make it with lamb chucks, they now use ground lamb. I ordered it and it was all grease. We tipped it over and the grease just kept on coming. We ended up sending it back as it was inedible.  The fish and chips continues to be on point."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are regulars here. Love going there for happy hour or on mondays for burger day and happy hour.
They have the best Turkey burger I have ever had and if you are interested, you can substitute the fries for a side salad. They told me the turkey burgers are made super fresh in the house and you can definitely taste it.
I have now tried almost all of their appetizers and they are all pretty good, too.
The bartenders are all very nice and make you feel welcome and comfortable. 
Happy hour, great food and service, live music on weekend nights and close to my house=couldn't get any better."}
{"text":"GREAT Irish pub! i went on a Friday during the live music performance. I can't remember the name of the band, but they were awesome! The lead singer/guitarist was way into the crowd and got everyone hyped. I only had a few drinks, but a Sailor Jerry was only $3.50 and was very strong! I like cheap strong drinks! Definitely a good time. Will have to go back and try the food."}
{"text":"Nice atmo, friendly service, decent food. This isn't very Irish to me, but at least it's not a sports bar with an \"Irish\" brand. This is a nice place to meet friends and hang out. Trivia night was pretty awesome and they have a decent concert calendar."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour and dinner, thought we'd give it a try.  The Buffalo wings were dry and cold, the mussels appetizer tasted like dirty dish water.  Ordered burgers medium rare, but received well done.  Cream of Chicken soup was ok and the fries were pretty good.  One saving grace was that the server was very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"A Saturday night.  Ordered Shepherds Pie which was fine.  Two orders of fish and chips which were not.  The cod had been frozen too long too many times and was virtually unedible. It peeled off the breading at the slightest pressure.  Bit slow on service and the table was sticky from previous visits.  Chips were xlnt and the waitress (red hair classic irish) was very attentive and accomodating.  Service gets a 5.  Food prep a 1."}
{"text":"I can't really comment on the food. But seriously this place has Kilkenny beer! My husband has had the hardest time finding this beer. We are from CA and last time he had this beer was is Ireland and New Zealand. We will definitely be coming out again. I can't remember who our bartender was on 3-13-18 around 10-12pm but he was awesome. Thanks bud!"}
{"text":"Awesome place and atmosphere! Love the Irish music and overall feel. Nice aet up whether to kick back and have some drinks or even watch a game. The food was excellent and the service was gracious and hospitable!
A great Irish pub and grille on the west side."}
{"text":"My mother and I have been searching for good fish to have during Lent.  We noticed Tim Finnegan's going in several months ago but had yet to try it.  We checked online and then called to see if they had a good beer battered fish.  The gentleman we spoke to assured us they did and we decided to give it a try.  They did not disappoint.  In addition to the phenomenal service we received the fish was just as impressive!  If I were to make any suggestion it would be to try to keep the fish separate from the chips as it made them a little soggy but still very good.  We wanted to try a dessert but were too full and took a Bailey's bread pudding to go.  Even though it was taken to go it was great.  I can only imagine how good it would have been had we eaten it there.  Fellow Catholics look no further for great fish not just during Lent but anytime!"}
{"text":"Although the presentation was sorta big-city-ish, I made a happy plate out of the corned beef and cabbage. Damn good stuff.  The house brew was tasty too. Next time shepherds pie!"}
{"text":"Great wings!!! When we walked in I thought I might have made a mistake because nobody was there. It turned out to be because we were so early (11:10am). Josh turned out to be a very good waiter. He made recommendations and was attentive and when he said he really likes the wings, he was right - really good. I also had the Shepard's pie that was well done, potatoes creamy and content not overcooked.

Atmosphere was dark like every Irish place I have been in. Big bar fully stocked. And as it got to be lunch time the place filled up.

Not cheap lunch but reasonably priced and they have regular specials."}
{"text":"Monday is Half price hamburgers. These Burgers are gourmet and only cost $5.00. It is a great deal!! You can get a pint of Carlsberg for $3.00 I love the Irish Pub music."}
{"text":"I got some burgers from here via uber eats. I got the peppercorn burger. It was so good. My boyfriend got the bacon onion burger and he loved it. Fries were yummy. I'm gonna be going here from now on when I want a burger."}
{"text":"I am taking a star away sadly :( 

We went in this past Monday. I order my usual, a Stella. I am told they no longer have that on tap and wasnt offered a bottle, so I am not sure if they carry it anymore.  :( This makes kiki a sad lady. 

We were starving so we started with an app. We waited over 20-30 minutes for our app to come out. The place wasnt busy at all and there were multiple waitresses. We actually had forgotten we ordered the app when it did finally come out. 

It took another 20 minutes for our order to come out. Not sure what was going on there. 

The food was just as fantastic as always!"}
{"text":"Liked everything about this place, French fries are freshly cut and worth the trip"}
{"text":"I'll have to get back to you on this one... I'm a fk'n regular here so obviously I love it."}
{"text":"I just went here last night for dinner for the 1st time in 3 years. The food and service used to be good from what I can remember but that definitely wasn't the case last night. There were a few people sitting at the bar but the restaurant itself was pretty empty. The sign said \"seat yourself\" when we walked in so that's what we did. It took a good 15 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us and she was definitely not on top of her game. We ordered a couple of beers and those took another 15 minutes. She came back a while later to take our order. We ordered an appetizer, 2 entrees, a kids meal, and 2 more beers. It took over 20 minutes for our pretzel basket to come out and she forgot about our beers. My husband walked up to the bar at which point our server came over and blamed the bartender for not pouring our beers in a timely manner. Our dinners came about 10 minutes after the appetizer. I ordered the Killarney chicken based on our servers suggestion. It was a chicken breast smothered in cheese and a garlic sauce with Irish bacon on top. The bacon on top looked like it wasn't cooked all the way through and I couldn't bring myself to eat it. I took a couple bites of the chicken and at first it was moist but the more I started eating I realized the other 1/2 of the chicken breast was super dry and really over cooked. I wanted to say something to our server but we had already been there for 2 hours and I just wanted to get out of there. We will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Comfortable atmosphere. I love restaurants with booths. We sit at a table 6 nights a week and love the intimacy of a booth while still being a part of the environment.
Lots of available parking, but you may have to hike a bit. The second thing I love about a restaurant.
The service. Pleasant , but busy.
The food. Competent, but I had pan seared cod that was smothered with chorizo gravy. Does every entree in Phoenix have to contain chorizo, hatch chilies or chipotle anything? I would order it again with the gravy on the side or hold it."}
{"text":"Fecking Great.    

Update:

Went for lunch:   This time I thought the corned beef taquitos even  better than last, curry chips tad saltier.  Still loving the appetizers and the cider.  This time had the  cottage pie,  it's  really nothing to write home about, specially if you are from the region and your parent's wouldn't appreciate you seeing other cottage pies;)    Spend the extra on the sheperds  it's really much better.   This was ok , really really nothing special and the heat could have been better.   Service  is good, but pedestrian , the last time I had no time pressure, this time I did.     We're sitting at 3.5 - 3.75 now with the round up till 4. Still  I'll return
 

Original Review:
 First thanks to Julie P for pointing out that this place exists. That it's within stumbling distance of the house ( think prolonged zombie stumble over an hour  versus a quick trip and recover)  is even better. 
Cider on tap is Strongbow and you get it in a real pint., Yay.  Sadly that's all they have and there's no bottled ones to try ,  Strongbow is  the Bud of UK ciders and while it's way better than no cider or what passes for beer here it's not that hard to stock more of a common drink for a themed bar. 

Onto the Food  (I'll get to it as a venue some other time)  
Appetizers.  Curry and chips was exactly what it should have been  and a generation of Irish and UK kids have  grown up with this for lunch  at the local chip shop.   
 
The  corned beef and cabbage taquitos  I think  are moving up to be our #1 appetizer that's not a hot wing. Taste of these  and the hot mustart / tomatillo salsa on the base compliment each other nicely. Not heavy on the fat and delightfully  crunchy.  For once an Irish restaurant trying to do something other than name US staples with cute regional names. 

Main: Salad   and the sheperd's pie. Let's not get into the salad it's a waste of time reviewing vegetables.  The pie is pretty good and none of the flavours overwhelm each other. Not sure the champ ( mashed potatos ) atop them live up to what lies below but it's more a personal texture issue than it spoiled the overall dish.  

Bread and Butter pudding is really good but please if you have any trouble sleeping after reading nutrition sheets as to the fat and carb content of your meal DON'T just  eat it and run round the  block four times before getting back in the car. 

Oddity?    parsley flakes on all the plates to make it green , please just buy green speckled plates , it's classier:D  At the end got a coupon for 25% off the next bill which I will certainly take them up on. It's as good  for food as any of the valley's Irish bars ( better imho)  but have to get back on pub quiz night  to really know.

Were in too early to hear the band but you can look at the pa, the space and  know it's going to sound  bad ( place looks like standing wave city)  with anything electric and full drum set.     The jukebox played \"i'm too sexy \" by Right said fred  WTF that really  messed up the ambience.Country bars don't have NIN on the box after all."}
{"text":"I had the best night out here last night.  We were welcomed with live music.  A man named AJ was playing with a friend and it was really good! The two of them played a great mix of music, from R&B to alternative rock. It wasn't overwhelming, like bar bands can be.  The waitress says AJ has played there for a while.

We ordered our beers and an appetizer- the garlic chips.  They were yummy seasoned fries with an excellent garlic aioli.  The garlic aioli was like a creamier version of the garlic sauce you get with your pita at a good Arabic restaurant. I I couldn't get enough of it.  My boyfriend kept telling me to slow down, but he was stealing big globs of the stuff in his fries (that thief!). 

For dinner, I had the Bacon Onion Jalapeño flatbread and a side of coleslaw.  The flatbread was great! The coleslaw wasn't super flavorful, but it was fresh and cooled my mouth down perfectly after consuming all those jalapeños.  

I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a great pub. First, the remodel on the inside is amazing. For what was once a pizza place you would never know. Great bar, wood work and decorations. We went for lunch on a Saturday. There were quite a few people but not overly crowded. Our server Theresa was excellent. She greeted us when we walked in and got our drinks. She recommended the cod slider appetizer and it was good. The breading wasn't too heavy or greasy. Very tasty. I had the lunch size Shepard's pie. Huge portion for lunch!! Very good flavor and again nit greasy. You can tell when things are homemade and it was. Hubby had a chicken dish with bacon, can't remember the name. He Gabe it a thumbs up. Overall, great service good food and a nice atmosphere. I'll go back when I'm on that side of town."}
{"text":"The service is phenomenal! My boyfriends Mom and Grandma love going there for the food and live entertainment. The crowd is younger and yet the staff makes them feel so comfortable. Treats them like queens. Special shout out to Alex and Dave."}
{"text":"Horrible! Food and drinks over priced...food was terrible! Only reason we drove all the way over here was to hear a band....they sent them home after 1 hr. Avoid at all cost! Bathroom was dirty with paper all over the stall floor, toilet seat covers laying off to the side...gross. Only 2 tables had people when we got here so don't understand why they couldn't clean them, I've seen dive bars with cleaner bathrooms. Employees not very friendly...no smiles at all."}
{"text":"Don't let the outside fool you, this place is legit. 

Nice selection of beers on tap (even Kilkenny, are you kidding me!!). 

Pretty good sheppards pie, great curry sauce, awesome decor. Practically felt like I was in ireland. 

I'll definitely be back sometime."}
{"text":"Excellent Pub Restaurant!! Great food, clean nice bar & atmosphere. Friendly bartender & staff."}
{"text":"So, we came here on a whim looking for bar food.  Boy did we find it.  The food that comes out of the kitchen is top notch and could certainly hold a candle to any other place in the city. I had the fish and chips, and was just blown away.  Sorry, but I ate it too fast to get a picture in...

The atmosphere is a cross between Cheers and the Tilted Kilt, and our server Dan was about as nice and helpful as he could be."}
{"text":"We tried the new location in Glendale. Good service, delicious food and reasonable happy hour prices. Love this place."}
{"text":"I have only been here a couple of times but this is totally my kind of place. Good drink prices $3 Carlsbergs, I have only had the fish and chips to eat and it was awesome. As far as Irish bars go, this one has good decor and detail. Now that its the only Official US Soccer bar in Arizona, I am going to spend a lot more time there come World Cup time."}
{"text":"Usually like this place, BUT the St.Patricks day party was a 10$ cover, for the same Irish band they have all the time. To stand and beg for a drink. When I get the drink, it's wrong and costs double what it normally costs... And it's in a cheap  plastic cup."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant using UberEATS & man are we happy we did! The philly fries are filling, the bacon garlic aioli burger yum! One of our guests had the cod sliders & couldn't get enough. Bread pudding was good. Overall we decided that next time we will make it out there to dine because the food was worthy."}
{"text":"Really disappointed. I was excited as heck to see this place so close by, and after reading through the menu, I couldn't wait to go.  I miss a good fry-up for breakfast, so I knew I had to give that a try. 

Whatever was done to those rashers is known only by the chef and God. It was clear they were not fried, and they had a greyish, mottled look of a meat that had been boiled or steamed. The black pudding had good flavor but was so incredibly overcooked and dry, it could have been packaged and sold by Jack Links.  The best thing on the plate was the wholemeal soda bread. It was crusty and hearty and I reckon would taste great with some soup or with a load of good butter. Our table also had a burger and some chicken tenders. The feedback on the burger was, \"The bun was nice.\"  About half of the chicken went unfinished. 

Very steep price point for some horribly abused rashers and a \"nice\" burger bun. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really good fish & chips, and had two different portions you could choose. Would definitely come back again. One side was restaurant style and the other was a pub, so you could choose either."}
{"text":"First time at the new location. I came here to see Jason Devore play and the place was so packed I immediately regretted driving out here from Mesa. I can't blame that on the business though, Jason is just very popular. This place is miniscule compared to their last location, with much fewer beers on tap, then again, they just opened. The first time I opened a tab I got two kiltlifters (they only had bottles) and it came out to $13 and some change, which I thought was rather steep. I then ordered a third beer and it was $4 and some change. When I ordered a fourth, it was a little over $6. Idk if they have kiltlifter in their POS system twice (maybe there is both draft and bottle in the computer) but I was rather annoyed that the price kept changing. Not to mention the only place a 12 oz. bottle of kiltlifter should cost more than $6 is at a ball game or a large concert venue. Maybe they'll work out the kinks, but either way I don't feel inclined to return.

Btw, the door guy was probably one of the most interesting people I ever met. I spent most of the time on the patio talking to him since the place was so vastly over capacity. That bouncer deserves 5 stars himself."}
{"text":"Everything was fresh and delish!Great beer selection too.We had the Crisp cod sliders and corned beef and cabbage taquitos  for appetizers and couldnt wait for the entrees.
We got the fried Fish and chips,Baked cod ,mussels stew it was all delicious.we shared a bread pudding and fought for the last piece."}
{"text":"We came here with a group of 7 for my husbands birthday. Everyone loved their food, fun drinks, fun service, great atmosphere. The fish and chips are top notch!"}
{"text":"Taking my Irish partner out to the pub should be a gesture of pure love. Finding an authentic pub near home should be a joy of epic proportions. Our visit to Tim Finnegans was disappointing. We seem to have difficulty getting attention in places we visit. Here again was a place we had to seat ourselves, get our own menu's, help ourself to silverware all while the place wasn't busy. We sat and when we did get a server she was incompetent. We tried to order food and drinks, but she left the table before we could finish.  We  got our drinks delivered by another server and asked for the appetizer from her. Then we just sat and watched the game on the screen. We watched our original girl take two other tables orders. Out came the appetizer and when it was completely gone, she came over to take our dinner order. 
The food: The chips and and curry appetizer was quite tasty, the curry sauce should be thicker to coat the chips more, and it could add some spice, but I thought it was a very novel item. The signature Lamb Shepherd's pie was very disappointing. You can substitute the L with an Sp and drop the silent B and get a better description of it's content. Hormel would be proud. The champ potatoes on top would be better replaced with pastry. My partner's corned beef and cabbage was decent. However the Corned beef was cut in narrow slivers and the meat was bloated with water. On the other hand the cabbage and parsley was very good. The potatoes were the same as atop the pie, they stood up better on a plate. We ordered the bread pudding and thought that the exterior was fabulous, the interior a bit too slimy and the whiskey/bourbon sauce, lacking in flavor or sweetness with a consistency that unnerved. I do not want to use an unsavory term for the consistency of that sauce, but it needs much more sweetening regardless. Take the sauce from Rula Bula and put it on the bread and you'd be much happier indeed! Over all the decor is nice, the place could have a good ambiance especially if they were playing Irish music, they weren't. It was some modern rock station. The check came before the dessert was gone and, well I guess we were done. 
Sigh. This really could have been a better experience."}
{"text":"We love to come in on Mondays for the $5 burgers....Sort of a long wait, every time. But...$5 burgers, of course you'll wait...lol:)"}
{"text":"We went here about a month ago for drinks and a late snack. We were hoping to hear the live music that was listed on their facebook page but either the band didn't show up or it was a really short set. We showed up about an hour after it was scheduled to start. Anyway, our main reason for going was to get my husband a pint of his favorite beer, Kilkenny. We sat at the bar and the bartender poured him a pint but it didn't look right. We were trying to figure out if it was right or not when another bartender walked by and saw the beer, commented that it didn't look right, and got him a new (perfect!) one. We ordered a few apps and they were okay- pretty much what you expect to get at a bar. Overall, we'll try this place again and hopefully try their dinner lineup!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place and couldn't go as often as we liked because it was a little far for us to drop in regularly - sorry it closed near Metro Centre but are so excited that it is opening close to our house 59th and Bell this month.  We have been checking every couple of days just waiting for it to open.  SO EXCITED!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was ok,  Cod in mashed potatoes, shepherds pie and Guinness was delicious. The service is great... BUT The live music... Omg. Please bring people who know how to sing. It felt Like super drunk karaoke. Whoever set the sound system, must look for another job. The treble was extremely high and it was so loud that we couldn't even hear the waitress, that a the first time I'm going out of a restaurant and I can't hear in one of my ears.. 

Owner: if you want your restaurant to succeed, hire people who know their job !"}
{"text":"This is a fun Irish pub. It's nice and dark inside to get you out of the AZ heat, and a good place to grab a pint and a filling meal. I often crave a bit-o-Tim Finnegan's after a long work day. They have some trivia and karaoke nights that get a bit noisy, but I always have a good time there. I love the burgers, corned beef and cabbage taquitos, and they have some good specials/happy hour options on each night of the week."}
{"text":"My husband and I were regulars here when they were located by Metrocenter. We were bummed out when they abruptly closed last summer. We were thrilled yesterday to see it pop up on Yelp under Fresh and New. Needless to say, that where we ate last night. LOVE the the location! They kept the charm of the prior location while updating it it with with some new decor and cool lighting. This place was popping last night! The restaurant was full and the vibe was good. The food was exactly as before which is what we were hoping for. We had the wings, which are our favorite, the potato skins, and shared the Killarney chicken. The chicken tastes home made and the green beans are cooked perfectly-not mushy, perfect with a little bite left in them. Glad to have this spot back, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Was on Yelp looking up local bars while on my trip to Phoenix , was really happy I stumbled across this place . They had the Brazil Vs Ecuador game and stayed for the whole game . The drinks here are amazing had a couple of Irish Mudslides , Irish car bombs , and the mint chip shots as well . I didn't get a chance to order an entree but did have an appetizer and it was delicious . If you're visiting and happen to be near here I definitely recommend this place , didn't get the bartenders name but the customer service was great . This place gets 2 thumbs up ."}
{"text":"Foodies: get over there for the Monday night burger special and wash it down with $3 Carlsberg's every day. On second thought, keep your distance - I love this place and want to keep it for myself! If you're a fan of spectacular, fresh, authentic Irish fare, have a strong liver, and want a cozy, inviting place to relax, come buy me a beer. At $3, you can afford it!"}
{"text":"Well.. I've  been bugging my family  to go for authentic  Iris food.
What a BIG disappointment. .. Authentic Irish hmm I  don't think so.  I had the corned beef and cabbage 
The corned beef tasted like canned.  The cabbage was stir fry and very  greasy.    Not impressed"}
{"text":"In Phoenix on business, my London-born wife and I looked on Yelp for a decent English or Irish pub. Tim Finnegan's topped the list, so we decided to check it out. When we arrived, live music was playing and the place was packed. We were lucky enough to find an open table with a great view of the Irish musician. I got the Reuben and she got the large fish and chips. My sandwich was delicious, and the chips (fries to us Yanks) were amazing. Her fish was done perfectly, and the portion was enormous - enough for both of us, truth be told. Washed it down with an expertly poured Guinness to cap a perfect evening. Our waitress was a lovely lass and more than gracious, if anything too apologetic for the slight delay in taking our order. We were in no hurry to leave and could see that she had her hands full. Overall it was a terrific experience, and we'll definitely be back next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Okay, first time at this new location. Made the mistake of going on St. Pat's Day. $15 each cover just to get in!!!! My husband had the corned beef and cabbage, and I had a rueben. Our waitress was slow and forgetful. My fries were stone cold but she took forever to come back around to us, so I just let it go. No regular beers today, so we had to have a specialty beer. Each of them were $8. We will not return to them on St. Patrick's Day. We are seniors and this was way too expensive for us. Almost $100!!! Wasn't worth it at all.  Very disappointed, especially since we are truly Irish."}
{"text":"What better place for a girls night out than an Irish pub? We sat in a great booth across from the bar where we could all talk easily (even with the karaoke happening in the background). The service was a little slow, but I'm pretty sure there was only 1 (super awesome) server running his tail off. Who knew Sunday nights were so busy?! I'm me more thing about our server: a man across the bar offered to buy our table drinks and our server ran interference for us. I love a place that makes me feel protected/watched out for. 

Our drinks were made well. My sister order d a couple specialty cocktails: Paddy's Punch (sweet, fruity, a little amaretto) and some mint cookie drink (baileys, creme de menthe). My Moscow mule was yummy, as were the vodka sodas. 

We had to try the Corned Beef and Cabbage taquitos (it's fusion!!) because where else would you find that?! I didn't care for them, but that's more of a texture than taste thing (Potatoes inside of a taquitos???). My sis liked them. We also go the the Buffalo Chicken Wrap (good flavor, but weird lettuce inside that didn't seem to go together!) and the Southwestern Chicken Wrap (yum!). The fries were kind of old and squishy. I bet they are amazingly delicious when they are fresh. 

One last thing: the karaoke jockey was great. Very welcoming and entertaining (good voice too). The setup is strange though...you either sing from your seat or stand awkwardly next to the server station and bathrooms. Lucky for me, I've got a lot of practice in awkwardness! :)"}
{"text":"Regardless if you DO or DO NOT like Irish food, I command you to eat here if you are in Phoenix. You will regret every minute should you disobey this order."}
{"text":"Great Irish Pub, from the moment you step through the door - quality food and drinks at affordable prices, excellent and attentive staff make you will fill right at home...even if you're not Irish."}
{"text":"Tried this place out recently, and have to say I am impressed. 

The first thing that I liked was the appearance of the place. Yes, it is part of a strip mall and adjacent to some oddball places, but as soon as you walk up, you can see that they stand out from their neighbors. The darkened wood paneling, the patio and the red entry doors leave little doubt that you're standing outside a pub. Once you step inside, you'll find subdued lighting, more dark wood paneling, cozy booths, plenty of bar seating and a definite pub vibe going on. You can only be so authentic in a place like Glendale and this is probably about as good as you're going to find anywhere. 

When we arrived, we seated ourselves (I guess how it works?) and were shortly brought menus and some water. I will say the water tasted like tap, and not in a good way, so I wouldn't recommend it as your only beverage. Fortunately neither of us went that route, and our other beverages were fine. I can't fault them for this, tap water is nasty in Phoenix no matter where you go, but just an FYI, it is definitely from the tap.

For appetizers, we sampled both the pub wings and the spinach dip. The dip came out first, followed shortly by the wings, and both were pretty good. The pita chips that came with the spinach dip are an interesting departure from what I've come to expect when order this dish elsewhere, but it wasn't bad. It might have been better if they were slightly less baked/fried, because a few times, the taste of the browned pita was overpowering the dip. Likewise, because they're so greasy from the baking/frying, the spinach dip actually struggles to stay on the pita unless you scoop up a massive helping. If you've ever tried to dip heavily buttered or oily pretzels into some cheese dip and noticed that none of it adhered, that's the same exact thing. Sure, you can work around it, but you shouldn't have to get creative to get dip on the chip. I'd still order it again, but just putting this out there as constructive feedback that I think would improve the dish. 

As for the wings, which we ordered mild, they were fantastic. The sauce tasted absolutely identical to something I've had at small, family owned pizza chain here in town, to the point where even my dining companion said the exact same thing, unprompted. Mind you, this isn't a criticism, because I love the flavor, it was more a pleasant surprise. I wish I knew where they bought the stuff, or where they got this recipe. Aside from the sauce, the wings were perfectly cooked and actually much better (and larger) than what I'm used to at the aforementioned 'other place'. Without a doubt, I will be ordering those again on my next visit. 

For an entree, we both tried the turkey club, and they were delicious. In my view, just the right amount of meat, and the flavor was spot on. The fries that come with the sandwich were not my thing, but I had so much other food, it really didn't matter. I'm not a big fan of fries in the first place, so again, I can't hold that against them. I understand you can swap it out for something else, but looking at the menu, I'm not sure what the something else would be. It would be nice if this was clearly broken out somewhere. 

Bonus points, this place does not appear to have any type of children's menu. Thank God! I can't stand being surrounded by oblivious, inconsiderate breeders who think a restaurant (and especially a bar) should double as a day care center, so that was a welcome change of pace, and yet another reason to go back. For any breeders reading this, take your squealing, ill-behaved spawn somewhere else, this place is for adults. 

Definitely going to make this a part of our regular rotation, and look forward to going back and trying some other offerings. So glad this place made the move from the ghetto of Metro Center to civilization in Glendale.

UPDATE: While I won't deduct any stars, I will warn you that the \"Live Music\" act, at least on Thursdays, is terrible. Andreas Rodriguez and his 'Ladies Night' is ear wrenching and insufferable. His guitar sounds like it's being tortured, he can't carry a tune to save his life and, unbelievably, he thinks that he's a comedian too. There were usually only two people clapping at his \"act\" and he was one of them. Management needs to kick this shit stain to the curb and get someone, -anyone- else. This guy came across like he packed a bowl before the gig and then couldn't perform worth of shit, but still thought everything was funny, including how bad he sucked. Get rid of this loser, your customers will thank you and so will their ear drums."}
{"text":"Love the new location!  Such a sweet little Irish pub to go to!  Went there last night with a friend for a couple of pints since we haven't been in since they moved locations.  Needless to say, Dan the Man was serving the drinks - I had a Guinness and Dan had great pours on it. 

It's so much nicer than the last place.  The patio is awesome, clean and well kept up.  

Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"To my knowledge, this is the only reason to step within 500 meters of Metro Center. It's got nightly specials on food and drink...and even if you're not going for happy hour, the $10 burgers are much better than I'd expect from a dimly-lit dive. It's better than you'll find in a lot of sit down restaurants! 

The beer selection is legit, with staples like Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA, Magners, and of course Guinness on tap. Makes me a happy camper. 

Only issues are that it never seems to get crazy, and that it's a (yuck) Jets bar."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere and Irish decoration / furniture inside (and I am English - have been to Ireland many times), it reminds me of the TARDIS as it looks small and nothing special from the outside and seems MUCH bigger once you get inside. Love the overall atmosphere. The service is good, the menu varied and the food excellent."}
{"text":"Decided to try the new location at last... I love the booths and decor, really DOES remind me of Ireland... all part of the atmosphere... The wings whilst not traditional Irish fare, were excellent; and the Irish breakfast wasn't at all bad (although the beans didn't taste like Heinz as stated, but were fine, and the black n white puddings were rather small), the Guinness was cold and the staff friendly - an enjoyable experience for sure. I plan on returning to give the Shepherd's Pie a shot - that used to be great at the old location."}
{"text":"Amazing menu and great beer selection!!! Probably the friendliest bar and wait staff in Phoenix! Don't pass this place up!"}
{"text":"I loved this bar since moving to Arizona, but really love the work they put into moving into the new location. The pub looks amazing. Sure it's smaller than the last place but now more cozier and defo a more authentic feel. Along with the locale and interior upgrade, the menu also got an upgrade. Loved the food at the old locale, but they defo kicked it up a few notches for the Glendale location. Some old and new faces among the staff, but as you'd expect with these owners, the staff they hired are friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. I live in Central Phoenix and close to other well known pubs, but it's honestly worth taking an Uber or Lyft out to Glendale to Tim Finnegan's. Apart from the Manchester City FC flag on the back wall, there's nothing not to love about this pub!"}
{"text":"Awesome food nice environment. The fish and chips here are to DIE for."}
{"text":"This place has plenty of seating, good happy hour, and knowledgable servers. The drinks were very good and strong. The food came out fast and was delicious. There was a good selection on the menu for drinks and food. The patio area was perfect. And there was live music inside and sounded great."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and the food and service were great. The wings, potato skins, and chicken sandwich were all awesome. I like the style of the place too. We will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great Irish Pub and the food is awesome. The service is exceptional. The owner makes sure that you are welcomed and is really awesome. I love this bar. Great drinks and food. The bathrooms are a couple steps above an out house, but I understand they getting a new building, so I will give them a pass."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a pint (or more) and ended up ordering the wings...and devouring them. Absolutely delicious, and the blue cheese is made fresh in house.
 Jim, the genuine Irish bartender, provided excellent service and conversation. 
One of my favorite watering holes!!"}
{"text":"The one positive is that our waiter was great and very attentive. When we went outside he would come find us and give refills or whatever we needed. My friend ordered rum and cokes and they were so weak she had to send it back...twice. I did not like the corned beef and cabbage. The corned beef looked processed to me. The live music was so loud we had to find a corner somewhere that would not blow my ear drums out. I was not impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Went here for St. Patrick's Day and I was definitely impressed! Although their set menu seemed a little bit more pricey than normal, I got to try their corned beef which I thought was AMAZING. Only thing is that I wish there was more!!"}
{"text":"I'll score Tim Finnegans \"the old 3-stars.\"  I stopped here with a coworker and we both had the Fish & Chips lunch special.  Having had great fish & chips (which should be made with haddock, not cod) I never expect more than 3 star fish & chips from most places and all the more so in Phoenix for an 8.99 lunch special.

So with that as a standard I got what I expected.  Fairly good fish & chips.  It was a good size slab of cod and the batter was just heavier than a light batter.  The fish was flaky and tender, not a bit overdone.  Phew.  So often it's overdone.  An Irish pub should be able to nail fish & chips.  If not, just shut her down.

The chips were thick cut and skin on, very good.  They came already salted and seasoned lightly.  When they are being served up with fish and you might use malt vinegar perhaps they should forgo the normal seasonings.

The atmosphere here was nice, dark and cozy.  Pretty much dead at lunch time but I imagine they are full on the weekend.  If not, they have a problem.  There is a stage and they advertise various events with live music, trivia and other such shenanigans."}
{"text":"This place is true Irish Pub.  Looking at the outside, its not the best, but go inside, and \"wow\" this place is off the hook.  The food is OUTSTANDING.  I had the Shepard's Pie and my wife had a corned beef and bacon soup that was fantasic.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had a great time today there. This is a great place to watch a Jets on Sunday. Tons of Jets fans great good also. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"The place is closed for Good, not opened anymore. Great food, Not for kids, a place for adults"}
{"text":"The best fish and chips in town! Great food, amazing atmosphere, and great service. If you want a local pub feeling but with better food this is the place for you. You can tell the owner Jimmy takes a lot of pride in what he does"}
{"text":"Great wait staff. Decent food. Ridiculously bad music when there's nothing live. Irish pub with gangster rap. No thanks. Good sports choices on the tubes. 
An Irish themed pub shouldn't have a juke box with inappropriate music. 

Oh, no Harp Ale on tap and the stinkeye from the bartender for asking?"}
{"text":"The pros - The pretzel and cheese.  The pretzel was warm and very soft, the way we like it.  There wasn't that many people there so we got our food pretty fast.  

The cons - There are two sizes of the real lamb shepherd's pie.  They are lunch and dinner.  The difference is $5.  DON'T GET THE DINNER!  There is not even a HALF A SPOONFUL DIFFERENCE.  You have been warned.  The only difference in the orders was that the dinner plate was bigger.  Yelp had a coupon for a free appetizer if you bought two entrees, so we got the pretzels and cheese for free.  They still taxed us for the FREE appetizer."}
{"text":"To start off we ordered an appitizer since the Yelp app gave it away free on a promo. We ordered the philly chips The food was salty. Ok, well the main food arrived and the chicken on the salad was rancid and had to be sent back also tbe turkey burger was like leather. It wasnt edible. When the bill arrived it had a built in 18% gratuity. We asked why amd were told because we used the free app promo and it was added to take care of the server who was terrible and taking care of our table. He was never around when you neefed him. Our little party of 4 people are never going back again."}
{"text":"We were originally heading to Tim Finnegan's to drink some brews and watch a soccer game.  Before going there we wanted to grab dinner at a nearby restaurant, but all of the restaurants had and hour + wait.  We were not willing to wait, so we headed to Tim Finnegan's to grab what we thought would be bar food.  We went in and could not find a place to sit because of an event happening.  Luckily, we arrived just as the event was ending and found seating within 5 minutes.  
I was not expecting much from the food since it was a pub, but I was wrong.  The food perfect!  My husband ordered the prime rib and I had the chicken over noodles with a cream sauce.  We do not normally clean our plates, but this night was certainly an exception, followed by desert.
This place is certainly a must visit!"}
{"text":"This place is a lot of fun to hang out with a group of friends.The drinks were good and the food came quickly. The music was live and was very good. I didn't even realize the music was live at first as I couldn't see the singer from where I was sitting.
Although the drinks were tasty, they were inconsistent in strength. Over the course of the evening I had three long islands. The first one was perfect. the second tasted like it had almost no alcohol in it and the third was ALMOST too strong, but being the trooper that I am, I drank it anyway!
We had split the happy-hour sized curry fries (under cooked), and the hot wings (good but not hot at all) and I had the turkey club sandwich.
The happy hour apps were good but nothing spectacular. Good for bar food though. The fries could have been cooked for an extra couple of minutes but the sauce was good though a bit on the bland side.  The wings were on the small side and I ordered the hot and didn't get so much as a tingle.
Now the club sandwich was REALLY good. I was quite happy eating that!
One of the things that bugged me is how hard it was to get the bartenders' attention. There was no method to how they chose who they served next. Sometimes they would check on us 2-3 times before we were ready to order another drink sometimes it would take 10+ minutes before we could get their attention. We even called them by name (in a completely non obnoxious way!). At one point, one of the guys I was with whistled to get the bartenders attention (after raising his hand, waving him down and calling him by name several times) so he could order another drink before happy hour ended, and the bartender went off on him."}
{"text":"Had so much fun at Tim Finnegans!-Rob is the best doorman in all of Arizona! Also, it's a little haunted."}
{"text":"Headline: Phoenix Rising games! 
Review: Quintessential Irish pub, especially the friendliness and positivity. Good people are the first ingredient of a great place, and as soon as we walked in we were greeted with good vibes and generosity. I don't know their names yet, but the staff is top notch. 

Menu has the standard traditional Irish pub fare, including corned beef, pies, fish, chips, etc. Also some unique options like a pretzel basket and cod sliders. We had the fish and chips, which were sublime. The fries especially were extremely tasty! Comes in large and regular and the large was enough to share fore date night. 

Live music on weekends. Beer selection is a mix of imports and local brews, and Guinness of course. Awesome neighborhood bar!"}
{"text":"Honestly, my rating of this bar/restaurant depends on who is bar tending. The owner, I believe his name is Tom, is great. He's attentive, funny and cracks a lot of great jokes. However, i'm very rarely fortunate enough to get him bartending for me. Otherwise i'd give this place a solid 4/5 stars.

Now, onto my review. I went here on St. Patricks Day hoping to hear some good Irish tunes and have some great drinks, as usual. The night started off on a high note. I walked in and to my delight, heard some Irish music playing. However, when we went up to the bar and ordered drinks, I was surprised to find that my Jameson and Coke was served in a tiny glass and charged $7.50. I don't think it was even 8 ounces total. 

From here, everything kind of went downhill. What started as some Irish music turned into a bunch of weird techno. Do they know what day it is? Do they know the style of bar they're advertising? I don't know, it was weird. I've seen them get great live music on St. Patricks Day, usually playing great irish music. I've come accustomed to seeing the Braizen Heads play here in the past but was bummed to see that there was no live band and eventually, loud techno playing in a bar thats clearly not built for music like that. It also made talking to my friends very difficult because it was playing too loud. 

I didn't eat any food this time, but for the most part I know it's top notch. They always hit the mark on their Irish Dishes.

Normally, I love this place, however this review is for a disappointing St. Patricks Day. Even with these issues, I still haven't found a better Irish bar in Arizona. At least they serve a variety of Irish beers, whiskeys and showcase different Arizona Craft Beers."}
{"text":"Service was great, atmosphere very good, location ok if you are stuck in Glendale, food ok but nothing to write home about, prices moderate."}
{"text":"A group of us are in town from California for Spring training, decided to stop in for a brew after a game. Glad we did! Great atmosphere, quick, friendly service. We come to spring training every year, we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I like this place.

I came here a little while back on a Sunday afternoon to hang out with my brother.  There weren't too many people in there so it was nice and relaxing.  The bartender (who looked a little like Bradley Cooper) was friendly and attentive and gave us excellent service.

We tried a couple of apps while we were there.  The garlic fries were pretty good but the corned beef taquitos were lacking.  They weren't what I expected and were kind of bland.

Other than that, this place is a cool spot to chill at.  They have some pretty decent specials throughout the week.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"The service was excellent. The food was delicious and the drink prices are very affordable."}
{"text":"I really like this place but have not been since the new menu took effect.  $3 Carlings are always awesome and love the daily half price happy hour.
.....

Ok, so it has been months since I wrote my review and I am finally getting around to updating this.  The new menu is great!  Fish & chips are hands down my favorite in the valley.  $5 burger Mondays are awesome and oh so overfilling!  The only item on the menu that I still can't get behind 100% are the corned beef taquitos.  They taste great I just don't like the sauce.  Then again, many of my friends love them and the sauce so it is probably just me.  Always a good time at Tim Finn's!  Restaurant is clean, staff is friendly and the owner is attentive.  Love it!"}
{"text":"1. When I saw the entrance door, I thought why did they move the entrance to the restrooms outside..
2. It sits in the same parking lot with a Subway.. An Irish pub? Seriously? 
3. The interior is okay. They got enough TVs, I asked to turn on a channel to see the review of the English Premier League day, she didn't find any. Though she found one and I was able to see sketches of the Totenham - Chelsea game. That's a plus.
4. They don't have Pumpernickel.
5. Made my order over the phone, was trying to customize menu replacing the regular mashed potatoes from the corned beef and cabbage plate with the garlic mashed potatoes and beans. She said she don't have the beans but I saw them in another menu item! The beef and cabbage was okay. But I think they felt wrong, tasteless. I think the plate needs more spices. Not too bad considering I paid my visit at 11 p.m. on Jan the 1st.
6. With Yelp check in and my order of one main entree, I got to pick any appetizer item from the menu for FREE. I picked a bowl of Mussels worth of $10.99 (my main entree was $12.39). Wow! Yelp is a cool thing!
7. My bartender was okay, willing to chat a little bit, paying attention to my needs but nothing more than that. 

I kinda didn't like the atmosphere, just not to my taste. 
And to top it off the manager, who's a real Irishman (not Irish-American) is a Man. City fan. Don't like the team and its supporters but it's personal :)

So.. this place gets well earned 2 starts and sure I ain't coming back."}
{"text":"This is our fist visit at the new location.  Nice digs!  We went on Friday for Happy Hour and it was packed!  We had the cod sliders and the potato skins;  both were great.  The Irish beers were on special and we got them quickly.  The Baileys bread pudding was awesome!  We're going to try another day when it's quieter, but we enjoyed our first visit."}
{"text":"So we were out doing our shopping and strayed a bit too far out of the CenPho region and ended up in gang-land.  Decided we should stop and eat somewhere that didn't end in \"iro's\" which meant we were limited to a chain or Tim Finnegans.

The place is pretty scary dark which makes for a very typical pub-like atmosphere.  They were jammin out some loud ass irish music in the back room which made the place almost impossible to talk in.  It was actually really annoying and I would have appreciated them shutting the hell up at any point during our hour there.  They had a bunch of thowball and rugby games on but you couldn't hear any of them.  Seemed like a great place to watch a match if they weren't playin such loud music.

I ordered some sandwich.  It wasn't very good.  It was supposed to be Philly Cheese Steak inspired but it was just sort of dry and lacked a creamy cheese that would have saved the bread.  It wasn't great but it was edible.  The mashed potatoes were pretty killer though and I would highly recommend them.

Our waitress spent most of her time sitting at the bar chatting with some people or playing games on the little bar top machine.  Our drinks never got refilled and she was generally inattentive.  I'd probably go back for drinks and whatnot but I'm not really feeling this place."}
{"text":"Finnegans is a Irish Pub on the south side of Metro Center, the pub offers a menu and full bar. On special nights music. 

Food; Friday Fish Fry has to be the best in town and worth the month. All you can eat for $15. My Daughter loves the Mussels, I myself haven't tried them but she has got that same dish for years and loves it. The beverages are always ice cold. 

Service; the Service was Friendly and outgoing."}
{"text":"Having never been o an Irish pub before, I was pleasantly surprised with the wide selection of food options that they had here. The place was dimly lit and gave it that dungeony type feel, which I have found out is a trait of pubs. 

The Guinness was poured as a proper one should be and they give you a free appetizer if you check in on Yelp.

 Would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to grab a bite to eat or an after work drink. 

The location leaves something to be desired, but this is a hidden gem of a place. 

The wait staff were super nice and my particular server was a lovely tattooed brunette. I don't recall her name, but she did an excellent job serving me and my party while we were on vacation. 

The food came out quickly, hot, and freshly made. Next time I am in the Phoenix area, I will try an stop by here and enjoy a pint!"}
{"text":"T. Finnegan's has the atmosphere of what you would expect from an Irish Pub, old world look and feel, good hospitality and good food, adding to the atmosphere were locals enjoying a game of European Football

Portion sizes are good and prices are fair. The Shepherd's Pie is very tasty and the fish and chips is fresh and good. We tried the corn beef and cabbage taquitos, a good old world spin on a local Mexican favorite. 

This is a good place if you are feeling a bit of the Ire."}
{"text":"On Friday I went in at 6:30am to watch the USA vs. Slovenia World Cup match yes I did just say 6:30am.  The even cooler part was when I got there my first item I ordered and received was a nice cold Kiltlifter.  Oh how good beer is when you first wake up. :)  They had breakfast which was great I got to drink 3 more beers while I watched the match which surprisingly was packed and if it wasn't for a horrible call from the ref was great.  I'll be back Wednesday at 6:30 for the final group match against Algeria."}
{"text":"Great new Irish bar n food
Good vibe
Great service
Great menu n the food was plentiful n good
Moderator busy on a Sunday holiday evening"}
{"text":"NOT YOUR TYPICAL MEDIOCRE BAR FOOD!  DELICIOUS BEYOND BELIEF!  

Seemed like the longest traveling day ever and we found this gem.  I ordered the corned beef and cabbage and thought I died and went to heaven.  Some of the greatest mashed potatoes ever.  

Seana (sp?) was an amazing server and the sweetest personality.  She deserves a gold medal for waiting on my exhausted overly traveled self. 

5 stars all around!"}
{"text":"Came into the restaurant and got sat right away. They brought waters while I waited for the rest of my table to arrive. Server was a younger gentleman and seemed very nice. We ordered apps, pretzel and spinach artichoke dip. Both were very good and came out hot. We then waited an unusual amount of time for our server to come take our entree order. We had to flag him down. We order our food and waited. Most of our food came out, except a salad two people at the table we splitting. The server said \"the chicken they put on the salad was over cooked so I am having them remake the chicken.\" We were appreciative. Then we waited. 25 minutes later the salad came out and everybody else was done with there food. The server didn't come back in that time to explain why it was taking so long or apologize. When they finally started eating the salad, the chicken was COLD. How could it be, if they were recooking the chicken? We moved on and didn't say anything. The server mentioned how he would talk to his manager about how long it took. Two people order fish and chips - both were not cooked and were still doughy. When every was done eating we then waited for the check. The entire time we were waiting we could see the server and the manager talking behind the bar. The manager was on her phone the whole time. We started to get impatient and made eye contact with the server. The manager still never got off her phone. The check came. THEY GAVE US $5 DOLLARS OFF WHEN THE SALAD COST $12... needless to say we were not happy but once again moved on. We then sat there AGAIN and waited for the server to come pick up the check. It took so long a person from the table got up and walked it over to him. I guess his conversation with the manager (WHO WAS STILL ON HER PHONE) was more important. 

Being a server in the past we still tipped 18% of the bill. I understand the kitchen could really be having a rough time, but 25 minutes to cook a chicken breast? It was NOT busy at all. This night could have gone way better if the manager came over and talked to us or took the entire salad off the bill. BUT clearly her phone was more important.  Let's just say we will NOT being going back here.

 I recommend only to go if you have plenty of time for people to wait on you and don't mind cold food."}
{"text":"I loved that they have community \"Give Back\" nights.  I was there for the first time last Saturday night for Forever Loved Senior Pet Rescue.  I sat at the bar and enjoyed the live music.  The place was packed.  The vibe was good, mixed crowd of older and younger people (I like that) and the food was excellent pub food.  I will definitely be back for another night out, especially because they give back to the community!"}
{"text":"Best authentic Irish pub in town.  Great environment, very friendly staff, and the food is out of this world.  Everything is made fresh, and tastes excellent. I recommend the wings for sure.  Curry chips are another favorite of mine as well."}
{"text":"I love this bar. Yes, I stole that from a Toby Keith song, but Tim Finnegan's is a great place for good food, good drink, and good times! The food is tastier than most bar food, at least to me. Their prices are amazing, and they pour a perfect Jameson and Diet. You gotta check this place out!"}
{"text":"Was searching to find a good place with a happy hour for some food, decided on here and what a good choice it was!!! Patience, our server was awesome!! She was very friendly, remembered everything and was very attentive. The food was absolutely amazing. Burger, fish and chicken kabobs!! All to die for. If we weren't so tired and full we would have stayed to listen to Holly playing acoustic, she was great!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for traditional Irish food and live music, this is the place to go. Alex was our bartender the last few times we were here and we never had to wait for anything.  Our go to Neighborhood Irish Pub."}
{"text":"It has been a while since we stopped by as we are loyal to O'Connors, but we heard the food was good so we got a late lunch one afternoon. The place was nice decor was traditional, the people were friendly. We sat at the bar, and they didn't have the drink I wanted but they did offer a couple other things. When the food came out, I just wasn't impressed if I recall correctly it was 11 dollars for 2 pieces of fish and some french fry's and I left still feeling hungry. 

If I were just going to drink I would go back, but the food just didn't impress me. I may try them again, but I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The best Irish Pub in AZ!! They have multiple TVs to watch whatever sport you want. The owners are from New York and always make you feel at home. They have great fish and chips that come with amazing garlic fries."}
{"text":"So the boy and I wanted a Sunday afternoon drink, near his place. We stopped by Tim Finnegans.  From the outside, in a strip mall, this place looks like a dive bar, but the inside isn't, at all. It was very nice/typical pub decor. There was a traditional irish band playing in a circle, in the corner. It was nice. The drinks were slightly overpriced, but they have strongbow and smithwicks on tap. I looked over the menu and there wasn't too many vegetarian options. We ordered the curry chips, which were awesome [think fries with a spicy curry dipping sauce]! The authentically irish bartender turned off the soccer game and turned on the tour de france when we asked, which was nice. Overall, I am just not a fan of \"themed bars\", unless the theme is \"dive.\"  However, I'll be back for another mid-Sunday afternoon drink."}
{"text":"Lamb Pastys was really good, great gravy!!  Cold beer and cool place for a few beers.  Could have done without trivia that was going on at the time we were there, but it's summer and i am sure they need to be creative to get more people in the door.  We will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Great shepherd's pie, good service and authentic atmosphere. The fires are good, too. And do I have to say anything about the beer selection on tap? Happy girl!"}
{"text":"Great Irish bar!  The beer selection includes a lot of Irish/Brittish staples (Guinness, Harp, Smithwick's) but domestics and microbrews as well.  Great, darker lit atmosphere.   The outside feels super sketchy, but it didn't necessarily seem unsafe to me.  More just run down.   Inside was clean and a fun place to hang out.  The appetizers were pretty good too.  The chicken tenders I got were big and freshly fried.  The garlic fries and spinach dip were good, too."}
{"text":"Coming from LA, I can tell you this is one of the best bars I've ever been to. It's definitely my go to neighborhood bar now. Killer food, awesome drinks, and even better staff. Get the fish and chips, pound some Irish whiskey, sit back, relax, and enjoy. Shoutout to my favorites Alex, Mel, Rachel, Bobby and Mitch-- even the doorman gets 5 stars here. Come visit Tim Finnegan's, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"THIS is how you make a hamburger.  Their burgers are such perfection that we have yet to order much else.  I love that you can substitute a salad for the fries (It's like $1 extra, but it's a nice salad with baby greens, roasted red peppers... a nice little, light compliment to a helluva burger).  The burger will make you cry.  It's perfect.  They've got the grill set at the perfect temperature so it has that nice flavorful crust that seals in the juice and flavor.  The bun is perfect... brioche, grilled.  The toppings are quality.  They just do it right.  Caramelized onions.  Roasted red peppers.  Garlic aioli.  Just good stuff."}
{"text":"Ever since I went to Tim F's I can't stop talking about this place, it's just so awesome!! I went before noon for the lunch special, unreal 3$ beer and 5$ lunch mon-thurs. best turkey sandwich ever!! I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great beer. Great people. This place is just all around enjoyable. Nicer area then the old one same feel."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying how devastated I was when me and hubby rolled up to the old Tim's at Metro last year only to find it closed. Fast forward to now. Was a wee bit curious to see if this Tim's was much different than what I'd gotten used to. Um, no. In fact, they came up even better. The bartenders are still awesome, friendly and just cool as hell. Great set up & location, inside is just right, and outside patio is great because it faces east. Food is phenomenal. Corned beef taquitos and curry fries- yes please!
I've been back to Tim's now about 4 times in the last 3 weeks. It's becoming my own personal Cheers. Love this place."}
{"text":"Went in a few weeks ago and had a chicken wrap, was not impressed, it was really watery. Our service was really good though, I'd stop in again if I was already in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"well... disappointed.  The website menu is obsolete :(  
Was told that I have to \"go online\" to see specials and new higher prices.
  The fries were taken off the happy hour menu as well as the wings and other specials.
The prices have increased on all the food and drink specials.
it is too bad. 
was a nice place to go once upon a time"}
{"text":"running into Tommy tonight was awesome. after the first time here i wasn't sure if it was the place he opened, but now its confirmed it is. and i'm happy to support any establesment that Tommy is behind, because he is one good guy. from my converstaion i assertained that every bartender is Irish born, which from our conversation is unique to Tim FInnegans. hats off to that. if i could find a swedish bar with 100% swed born bartenders i would be into that. but lets face it, the sweds arent exactly known for their beer or whiskey. so it is what it is.

i wish Tommy the best with his place and hope nothing but the best for him. the Yelp party was a great success. i'll drop in more if i'm in the area. 

i hope the Douchery doesn't infest this place as i previously predicted. Tommy assured me it wasn't the clientel he was looking for. so i'm crossing my fingers."}
