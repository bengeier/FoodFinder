{"text":"Love this place.  I can find lots of things I grew up with.  The meat counter is good, however, I've seen some people sneak out with extra goodies from the back, like fresh sauerkraut and sausages.  I'm guessing if you ask for specific things, there are more (freshly made and authentic) items at back."}
{"text":"Prepare to be overwhelmed! Polcan is a treasure-trove of Eastern European delights. Their sausages especially, are worth the trip! Most, if not all of the staff speak what I believe is Russian, but they're bilingual - plus, all you need to do is point at whatever meaty-goodness you desire. They do serve a few hot dishes on-site as well, for take-away. I highly recommend their breads and condiments (such as the hot mustard) as well."}
{"text":"Wow, they have the most unprofessional service! I was standing in a long checkout line, and another cashier opened the second register. However, instead of serving those who have been waiting, she started serving some old dude who dashed to the register as soon as he spotted her opening it. Me and the customers next so me were appalled, so I went up to the cashier and said \"excuse me, but we have already been waiting in line\". Without looking up at me she said \"sorry we can't control who's next\".  Ummm, yeah you can. I left my groceries and went to Cracovia which is literally two blocks away next to the London Drugs, and bought the exact same products. That's how capitalism works, ya commie hag.

However, if you do go to Polcan, make sure to check the expiry dates of products, as they keep those on the shelves hoping you'll buy them."}
{"text":"I was suprised to see how large Polcan is, and how long their lineup was at the deli counter. 
They have so many products! 95 % of it Polish, some with no English writing on at all, so it was fun guessing what we were looking at. I guess I wouldnt suggest it for those looking into the nutritional value of foods, because you wont find that info on the labels.
I bought myself some pickles (typical, i know) mmmmm...cruchy.
Definately going to see what all the fuss is about and grab myself something at the deli next time. There are tables at the front of the store to eat your purchases. 
Besides Polcan, in the strip mall is The Better Butcher and a cute small bakery, plus a Shoppers and a liquor store, so a one stop shop!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service.
Every woman I dealt with from the meat counter to the till were rude and dismissive. But, I definitely noticed that if you were Polish they bent over backwards for you.
Wow!
I will not be back."}
{"text":"This use to be one of my favourite local delis but after today's experience, I doubt I'll be back.  
I was patiently waiting in line at the deli counter for my turn. Several older gentlemen walked up just before it was my turn.  One of the clerks served one of these gentlemen ahead of me, fine I let that slide.  Then two other clerks walk over and help the other two gentlemen behind and completely ignored me.  At this point I was so angry I didn't want or need deli meat and sausage.  
Also while I was watching these ladies serve customers, I watched one eating samples while serving customers!  Not very sanitary if you ask me!!
You have lost a customer!"}
{"text":"Best kolbassa (garlic sausage) outside of Winnipeg!!! ... you will get the reference if you have ever enjoyed the Winnipeg Ukrainian food!! But seriously a family favourite and always worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I wish I was Polish so that I can fully reap the wonders of the shelves of this great Polish deli. However, I have been brave enough to try a few items. I love their mustard and pickled veggies selection. They also have oiled herring that goes great with crusty bread or as a nigiri topping. Their deli meats and sausages are great and are reasonably priced.

But my main reason for coming here is their deli meals. I always pick up their frozen perogies, cabbage rolls, and hunter stew for those weeks where I didn't feel like cooking lunch. They also cook these and I always get it to go. I suggest getting their cabbage rolls, hunter stew, perogies, polish sausage, and this fried meat filled roll ( I call it the polish hammer burrito).

The only thing I find kind weird every time I come is that everyone that works here looks like they're dressed as dental assistants. It's not a complaint, but I feel like I came for a health appointment. But they are very very helpful and kind :)"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of deli's and Polcan is one of the better I've been to. I'm not very familiar with a lot of Polish food but I am a fan of what I've tried. My particular favorite is the hot lunch items they offer. Perogi's, dumplings, pork cutlets, cabbage rolls. Soooo yummy and worth the trip to the south."}

{"text":"There must be a cultural divide between Eastern Europeans because no matter how good this place is, it will always be within a Hungarian deli's shade. No doubt that Polcan is packed to the brim with European imported goodies (everything from toiletries to canned goods), and most of the prices are competitive (that is to say, slightly higher than necessary), but it ain't Hungarian!

Their cold cut selection is extensive, and it is probably the best place to get ground pork out of anywhere I've gotten it in the city. I haven't tried their hot items but they look like they would be delightful. They also have a wide selection of pastries, and if there's one thing that Eastern Euros know aside from sausage, it is pasties! There is a cheesecake (not of the Canadian variety, but made from cottage cheese) that is simply divine, light and flavorful. The downside? You could get a giant, inferior Canadian cheesecake for the same price.

All in all, if you are looking to get into some tasty treats from the east, you would do well to visit Polcan - and try to bring a native speaker with you to seem more legit.
