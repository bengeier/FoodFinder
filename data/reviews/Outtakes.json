{"text":"Like most cafes in an office building, their primary selling point is convenience.  They make good sandwiches, but there is generally only one offering at the buffet.  When, you factor in the time it would take to drive or later walk to other options, going here can make sense.  The staff is definitely pleasant."}
{"text":"I like this place not only because it is most conveniently located in the building I work, but also because of fresh and tasty food. They have good variety in food and serve Starbucks coffee too. Staff is very pleasant. They are definitely one of the reasons for so many regulars here. Place is very well maintained."}
{"text":"I love this place because it's right inside the building where I work in Ballantyne. The decor is very modern/contemporary and everything here is well stocked/organized. Their service is excellent, they know me by face so I even stop by once to pick up fork/spoon for food I brought from home. I was feeling bad abt it but they were not, the lady was like you do need to eat home cooked meal once in while :)

If I forget to pickup my Starbucks, I don't have to worry abt it because they got me covered, yes they brew Starbucks. I don't even have to stop for breakfast because  they have my favorite breakfast scrambled eggs with potatoes veggies. Hmm... they have successfully kept me in the building but I will get out for lunch for sure. Oh wait.. I got back to back calls so I need to grab something quick, they got me covered as well since their lunch only cost me $3 for veggie sandwich which was delicious. My breakfast cost me more than my lunch. 

I guess they are doing good job at keeping me in building all day and I am happy abt it :)))"}
{"text":"Ariel and Adrian take care of me here. They know what my usual is and always greet me with a hello and a smile. They are super friendly. Prices are reasonable. Of course to echo everyone else's sentiment that the location is convenient. I just wish that Outtakes stayed open later. It closes at 3 and the grill closes at 2:45- so get your order in before then and you'll be square!"}
