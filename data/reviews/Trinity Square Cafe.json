{"text":"Trinity Square Cafe gets a 5-star rating for a whole host of reasons.  

The Cafe is situated in the basement of the Church of the Holy Trinity in Trinity Square next to Eaton Centre.  It is open for lunch every day, 5 days a week (except during the G20 summit apparently!), and the food is served cafeteria style.  

The location is amazing.  On a warm summer's day, you can partake in the labyrinth and watch kids play in the fountains after a hearty meal.  The Cafe has a limited menu, but what it does serve is wholesome and nutritious.  Most of the items are vegetarian, and sometimes with vegan selections.  I've had veggie lasagna and veggie chili here before, as well as various soups - all done well for a quick cafeteria style lunch.  

And the price - oh so cheap.  Two can eat here for $12-$15 and be absolutely full.  Service is minimal as it is a church basement cafeteria, but it works.  You see business types, tourists, and lower income folk in one room eating together sometimes sharing tables.  Cash only, so come prepared.     

Service is friendly.  Holy Trinity Church uses the cafe as a place to help train and reintegrate people recovering from mental illness.  You wouldn't even know it most of the time and that in itself helps break down many of the barriers and stereotypes associated with this type of illness.  It is a great idea and works.  

Bravo!  One of my favorite lunch places in the area."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! I walked in one day, not knowing what to expect. Turns out they hire and support adults with mental illnesses. Great initiative! Then you go to the counter where the staff prepares your food super fast while making your day. Pretty awesome! And then you find out that your home made meal is fresher, tastier, and more affordable than anything on the block. If you work in the area, this is THE place to get your lunch!"}
{"text":"Trinity Square Cafe is absolutely fantastic, for more than just their lunchtime offerings. Set up cafeteria-style, this tiny lunch spot just outside of the Eaton Centre is only open for three hours each day, and offers rotating lunch entrees, soups, salads, sandwiches and baked goods that are all 1) homemade, and 2) reasonably priced. The food is fresh and delicious, and the portion sizes are quite big, especially when you consider that their daily entree + a soup or salad only comes to $7.25. They offer mainly vegetarian fare, from veggie lasagna to spanakopita and their regular cheese, tomato, cucumber and lettuce sandwiches, and I believe all their soup offerings are veggie as well. On the food/price combo alone this place would deserve 5 stars, but when you consider that the cafe is a non-profit charity that assists people with mental health issues to transition back into the work force, this spot become truly remarkable. A fantastic and worthwhile alternative to overpriced, premade, salt-bomb food court fare, in a short time Trinity Square Cafe has become my regular lunch go-to."}
{"text":"I've been going to TSC for lunch at least 3 times a week for the last few months, and the food is consistently wonderful. 

The Moroccan Tomato soup is absolutely delicious, their chowders are lovely, the mac and cheese and meatballs are both fantastic, and the salads are lovely and fresh. 

The staff are all (?) part of a training program for adults with mental illnesses, and it's wonderful to see people growing and changing as you go back over weeks and months."}
{"text":"My other favourite go-to lunch place in this part of downtown, Trinity Cafe serves amazing soups and substantial sandwiches, served with an optional salad. They also have a rotating main special, which can include mac-n-cheese, spinach pie (spanakopita), vegetarian chili, etc.

My absolute favourite soup is their tomato-moroccan. It has peanuts, so beware if you have an allergy, but if you can eat it, it's thick and hearty and addictive.

Their home-made desserts are delicious, especially rhubarb or pecan pies.

I like that they provide a place to train and employ folks with mental health issues so I like to support this cafe when I can.  A little gem. 

Lunchtime hours only, and if you want the tomato-morroccan soup, may want to get there early!"}
{"text":"Great, affordable food, and a great cause! 

I really like coming in here and seeing the progression made by the staff. Everyone is so friendly and the food is really good! Keep up the great work!"}
