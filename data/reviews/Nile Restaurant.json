{"text":"The food is ok. The service is not good, and you HAVE TO pay 20% tip for that. Don't bother going here."}
{"text":"I am not optimistic about this location, since I was a fan of the previous occupant as well (an Indian restaurant), which obviously didn't survive. The interior is unremarkable, but I can't say the same about the food! Their hummus is fantastic, as is their falafel and lentil soup. For lunch, my favorite thing is the kefta kabob, which comes with hummus, rice, and grilled vegetables. Delish! Mohammed et al. are very courteous, and, when I have ordered takeout, the orders have always been completed promptly. I hope this place makes it. After all, where else can you tell a dining partner to meet you \"in de Nile\"? Go ahead. Say it out loud. You'll get it."}
{"text":"Delicious food, and the prices are reasonable.  I got the egyptian lentil soup, which I absolutely loved, and the spinach lentil soup, which was good.  The soups were a very decent size, and two of them were too much food.  The hummus plate and pita were fresh and really tasty as well.  Our waiter was very attentive and refilled my water every time I emptied it, which was at least 5 times during the meal."}
{"text":"Another one of the those places where some of the food is good, and other stuff must be avoided.  Gyros here is a joke, this is not much different, if at all than the kind in the freezer case at Copps, avoid it, you want decent Gyros in Madison, go to The People's Bakery on the east side, not Parthenon.  Okay, the falafel is good enough to eat, not the best I've had, but works.  Really the best thing I've had is the chicken shawarma sandwich, so this is what I would suggest to you. It's probably closer to 4 stars, maybe 3.75.  The hummus also is very good.  Nile is a worthwhile middle-eastern place for food, they should stop trying to do it all, and just do what they do best."}
{"text":"We ordered mezza for two and fried kibbee. Hummus and baba ghanouj were ok nothing special. Did not like the kibbee it's different, than what I am used to. The grape leaves are not homemade, they are from a can, flafel we're good and the tabouleh. Maybe they should do one region middle eastern food. (LEBANESE). The best of all middle eastern food. Rather from all over."}
{"text":"This is an underrated gem in madison.  The food is reliably good and has been for years."}
{"text":"I had to come back and update my review because it has not been good on average. We decided after trying a few items that there was really only one thing that we liked a lot. Tonight, we ordered that item for take out, and it was inedible. The meat seemed old and too chewy. The yogurt sauce was super sour- I couldn't tell if it was spoiled. The hummus was still fine. The pita was whatever. Anyway, we ended up throwing most of it away and deciding it is not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"The Nile restaurant is the next best thing to traveling to Cairo.  The delicious middle eastern food here is matched by the friendly atmosphere.   The fabled Arab hospitality is a reality at the Nile.  We felt as though we'd been invited into the home of a friendly Egyptian.   And his mom turned out to be an excellent cook."}
{"text":"We decided to check out The Nile on a whim when we were looking for new (to us) restaurants in the area.  They did not disappoint!  We got an order of baba ganoush to start, which was delicious and well-plated.  We both got separate orders of beef schwarma and salads.  The salad was ok, but the schwarma was excellent.  Every piece of the plate - the hummus, the beef, and the tzatziki - tasted just as good as it looked (which was pretty dang good).  The beef was perfectly spiced.   Service was excellent as well - can't say enough good things about our experience.  Much better than our experiences in Greece last March (though I will admit we made some bad tourist trap decisions there).  Can't wait to stop by again!"}
{"text":"Great place, whether it's lunch or dinner time. Hummus is to die for! Just a warning though - the kebabs are a bit spicy for those who don't tolerate any spice at all. Really recommend to check this place out."}
{"text":"I love the falafel sandwich. Instead of being a folded pita with a few falafel thrown in, it's rolled making it much easier to eat and the portion of falafel is generous.  The hummus was creamy and delicious. All the ingredients tasted fresh. I also enjoyed the tabbouleh salad and baba ghannoush. The stuffed grape leaves were ok.  I had takeout twice, so I can only comment on the food."}
{"text":"I would have never thought to pull into this strip mall in search of food. Thank goodness for Yelp! The selection was great with moderate prices and the flavors were fantastic! The hummus and baba ganoush are toddler approved and we loved the Egyptian crepe (so rich...impossible to finish the whole thing). Very nice service, quiet, comfy atmosphere, and generous portions. We will be back."}
{"text":"Very bad service.  The waiter was in rush n was a bit rude.  the food was also bad. The backlava was the worst ever. Would never ever go back again"}
{"text":"Very underwhelming. Nothing was very fresh or flavorful, portions were stingy, item left out from my takeout order. Falafel was tiny and stale, ditto for pita. Hummus and baba weren't flavorful- it was almost hard to tell which was which. Not recommended which is too bad because I'd love to find a west side falafel place to go to all the time! If you're close to campus Naf Naf is actually a pretty good falafel option. I feel bad recommending it because it's a mini-chain/completely not authentic but it's fresh, delicious and consistent."}
{"text":"Great service, Vegetarian plate was nice portion. We both ordered so we could choose all options.  We liked all items. The Grape Leaves were different than what we are accustomed to.  The had a bit of tomato in them which made them a little mushy. Flavor was still good. Both lentil soups were delicious. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! The food here was amazing! Our party of five stopped here in Oct 2013 and we really enjoyed the food.   We were served plenty of crispy pita bread available when ordering hummus, and it was topped off when our entrees arrived. Next time I am in Madison, this will be one of my stops."}
{"text":"\"Meh. I've experienced better\" To me a mediterranean place is only as good as Pita they serve. We were served what I think was microwaved Pita (Naan). The Falafels and the soup were great. For the price they charge, the portions are very less. Spinach pie was more like an appetizer rather a main course option. The baklava is not something that makes you go \"wow\". It was ordinary.   It was a surprise when the check came with 20% gratuity included ! I really wanted to tip less, for the service was bad. The waiter forgot to bring our order of soup. He probably would have remembered if he had written it down !"}
{"text":"Very impressed from my one lunchtime visit.  Best falafel I have ever had!  Will definitely try again."}
{"text":"Having eaten here several times and had mixed experiences, I wonder why I'm so out of step with these other reviews. I enjoyed Lulu's, the progenitor of the Nile, but I wouldn't have put it any higher than 3 stars either.  This past time I decided to have the combo with the Kibbee, Sorar, & dolmatas. After previous meals, I was hoping to find something that I liked so I could order it when I return with our companions who are fans. Of the three I think I'll stick with the stuffed grape leaves which were tasty and moist. AS good as I have had any where. The other two dishes were quite dry. The kibbee was an interesting dish made of bulgar, beef, and pine nuts. It surprisingly hot, not too hot though. The yogurt sauce was a must to contact the dryness.The sorar is like a pasty, a pastry shell with lots of rice, veggies, some meat & pine nuts. Because both dishes were so dry there was not enough flavor for me.  Perhaps I don't appreciate these dishes as they are supposed to be but for my taste they were not that great.  I will say that the portions have been good, the prices are fine, and the service has been good as well. But I won't be back on my own (too many other places to chose from) but likely return when our friends invite us.  For those picking on the decor: I find it very typical of middle eastern restaurants of this type. Even in the Middle East..."}
{"text":"Getting the negatives out of the way first, the atmosphere is entirely unremarkable, the music is awful and too loud, and the service can be a bit spotty.  HOWEVER.....the food is absolutely sublime.  I've been there upwards of ten times, and have yet to have anything that was not outstanding. They make the best falafel in town, and I would be proud to serve their hummus at my next dinner party.    The prices are just right, too.  Lunch seems to be an especially good deal.  So, unless you think form more important than substance, do yourself a favor and hit the Nile for your next meal out.  You will not regret it.  One star withheld for the aforementioned negatives."}
{"text":"Excellent food, especially tabouli, pita, spinach lentil soup, beef shawarma, and kefta. Coffee and mango delight drink are both great too. Fresh, homemade and healthier menu options than a regular restaurant so you feel good when you're done eating, not guilty."}
{"text":"We ate here two nights in a row (Friday and Saturday) and were very happy with the food and the service.  Both times we were were seated in a comfy booth.  The decor needs updating but I did like the drama of the black flocked wall paper on the back wall.  The flatbread arrived warm and lightly singed with a plate of seasoned olive oil--a very appealing introduction to the meal.  We ordered the vegetarian platter with hummus, babaganoush, and falafel.  The baba ganoush was the star, extremely flavorful with the hummus a close second.  The falafel was pleasantly nutty and crunchy but was less well seasoned.  But  dipped in the tangy tahini sauce, that became a non-issue.   The second night I ordered the lamb shank (I might have ordered it the night before but the waiter did not alert us to the specials and we had missed the billboard at the entrance to the restuarant).    It was very tasty, falling off the bone, but just the slightest bit stringy.  It was accompanied by huge mound of rice and a tomato sauce with string beans which reminded me of a lamb dish with stewed okra that I have had at Turkish restaurant in New York.   The first night my husband ordered the beef shawirma and the second the lamb kebab and kefta combination.  The meats were very tasty and were served with hummus on the side.  The shawirma had a cinnamon? flavor that was very interesting.    The meals came with soup or salad.  The salad consisted of lettuce, tomato, cucumber, green pepper, tomatoes, parsley chopped small.  It was delicious and tasted like tabbouleh salad without the bulgur.    I wasn't a fan of their diet coke from the fountain--the mix of syrup to soda just wasn't right and it left a nasty taste in my mouth.  The next night I ordered a glass of wine (garnacha) instead and was much happier.    The waiters were very solicitous on both nights.  When we asked for more bread, it arrived quickly, taking only as long as it took to heat up a new batch in the oven.    Baklava was the perfect ending to the meal.  We live in Minneapolis but if return  to Madison, we would happily return to the Nile."}
{"text":"Service was pretty bad, they take forever to bring stuff even the Togo boxes. The waiter is very rude. Out of the 6 dishes only 2 were edible, Chicken shawarma was an exception. They brought extra Salad dish when we actually asked for the salad that comes with a $2 fee. The waiter was pushing us, feels like he wanted us out.  I will not recommend anyone."}
{"text":"a hidden gem in the mad-city!  meals are reasonably-priced, with good portions.  service is exceptional.  the decor is cute - totally reminds me of my egyptian sister-in-law.  love the rose-flavored water, very refreshing.  and most importantly, the food is exceptional!  i'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"I love the Nile for lunch so I decided to try them for dinner. I tried something new tonight and was not fond of it. It seemed to be mostly cheese. When I thought about how few vegetables I had I realized that my salad was forgotten. My fault for not remembering earlier, but I was also one of two tables so should have been easy getting everything in my order. I very much regret my dinner choice and will not be returning for awhile and I will only return at lunch and stick with items that do not have cheese."}
{"text":"The dip they gave us at the beginning of the meal to dip our pita in was amazing! We all loved it! The workers were friendly, asked how our meal was! Loved the falafel, which isn't hard because it is my favorite food! Would defiantly suggest this place! My boyfriend loved his lentil soup and Schwartz and my mom throughly enjoyed her lamb!"}
{"text":"Nothing but very good reviews from our party of 12 who dined at the Nile on Tuesday night. We all had very good food, well-seasoned and reasonably priced. I can specifically recommend the sorar, hummus, and tabbouleh and am very eager to try the Nile chicken, spinach cheese pie, and lamb dishes which were enjoyed by some of my companions.  The service was very efficient and we asked for and received separate checks without any problem. We plan to return...soon. Parking was a bit of a challenge, as it seemed to be prime time for classes at the karate school next door."}
{"text":"We tried the Nile's food for the first time two weeks ago. Ever since the Shish Cafe closed in Madison we really missed good authentic middle eastern food.So we thought we would try this place.On the one hand I'm thrilled this restaurant exists in Madison because there aren't many options for middle eastern food, on the other hand despite the food being good it was not as good the Shish Cafe. The baba ganoush was very tasty, so much so I couldn't stop eating it. I would say it's a little too heavy on the garlic though, that could be toned down a bit. The lentil soup was only ok, it was much more runny than I would have expected it to be. I would probably skip the soup next time. The hummus was good, as was the shwarma. The side salad was really fresh and had a great dressing, however, it had a lot of parsley in it,I would tone that down just a little too. Surprisingly the French fries that came with the dinner order of gyros were absolutely amazing, crispy and some of the best French fries I've ever had. Probably even the best!I would not have expected to find the best French fries at a middle eastern restaurant. The prices were steep, which I'm guessing might be due to the cost of ingredients, but I think the prices are a bit too high and could be a little lower. Also while the server (who may have also been the owner) was not rude and was polite, he certainly didn't seem overly nice and I didn't necessarily get the impression he appreciated our business which kind of disappointed since we dropped quite a bit of money there. I think this restaurant has the potential to be excellent it just has to make a few improvements to get to that point."}
{"text":"Great food but sour, unfriendly owner and waiters. I ordered takeout and arrived to find they had given my order to another customer. When I said I would wait for another order, the owner barely said anything. When I asked for cup of hot, mint tea in return for my patience, the owner scowled and said \"no that not okay\". I left and got great Asian food at Tai's. Nile is always like this. Staff need the 10% happier app."}
{"text":"Food is amazing; best hummus, best greek dressing and best lamb.  My kids love it there too."}
{"text":"I've been here now a few times, and I do have to say that the service has always been top-notch, a rarity it seems. It's a nice cozy place with good ambiance and plenty of other-worldly menu options.   First off I love ethnic fare, especially if it has some kick, so this type of venue is right up my alley. On a recent visit, I was very pleased with my spicy chicken/rice entree, with generous portions of meat and plenty left over to take home for another meal (gotta love that!). I also like the complementary bread and olive oil for dipping. My companion ordered a lamb dish which he much enjoyed. On a prior visit however, I ordered an item containing ground beef and vegetables wrapped in a puff pastry. It was dry and tasteless and I left very disappointed. I learned to steer clear of similar menu items.  Overall, The Nile is an excellent choice for Mediterranean cuisine on the west side. With unique menu choices and prompt, attentive service, this place is hard to beat!"}
{"text":"Great food .. quick service .. ordered falafel and grill mix for two .. lots of food .. fresh off the grill .. and hummus comes with it which was a plus .. Will definitely come back here n bring more friends"}
{"text":"Coco wawa!!!  I love this restaurant.  Excellent service/Excellent food.   Go eat there."}
{"text":"Love the kefta and shawirma but the rose water they serve is a bit strong for our tastes. We've been for lunch and for dinner with no problem being seated. Lunch seemed to be slightly more flavorful. They are heavy on onions, fyi.  A favorite when we are craving mediterranean meats."}
{"text":"I was so sad when Husnu's closed down... until I stumbled across this place! I love the mezza platters and so does my family! I always order with soup (no matter which kind). The service has always been super nice and attentive, too!"}
{"text":"In my younger college days I used to live a couple blocks away from Lulu's but in yet another case of youth being wasted on the young I never took the time to dine there.  At the time I had no interest in Mediterranean cuisine, a mistake that I've only recently addressed.  And while I cannot reverse the actions of the past I'm happy that out of the demise of Lulu's arose the Nile.  I've been atoning for my past negligence over the course of the last year and this restaurant is certainly at the top of my favorites in town.  At first I was a bit concerned by the lack of patronage especially on weeknights, but I'm happy to see this place start to attract a crowd.    My last time here was the best so far, a Friday night with a mostly full room and in a nice surprise two bellydancing performances. We split a bottle of Italian pinot noir and got an order of the bisara, a pureed fava bean with caramelized onions concoction that is absolutely delicious.  The pita was perfect when it was brought out but the two remaining wedges had hardened considerably by the time the entrees came.  This didn't prove to be an issue as we were brought another basket along with a refill of the orange blossom-flavored water.   For the entree I shifted from my usual order of the hummus bel-lahmeh (excellent) and went with the lamb shawirma (also excellent).  I go back and forth on lamb as it can be too much for me sometimes but this was just about perfectly seasoned and not overly tough.  The entree did not come with tabbouleh as my usual does, but I made up for it by getting with house salad.  Following dinner two of us opted for the Arabic coffee, which had more cardamon flavor than I've had elsewhere, while the third had a piece of tiramisu.    The main downside in my experiences here have always related to the pace and quality of service.  I've been lucky in that I've never experienced a really bad dinner but I've heard stories.  Some of the times I've been here there have been only three or four tables occupied with only one or two servers working.  I've only seen the occasional delay in refilling water or clearing appetizer plates, nothing that really diminished the experience.  But I also don't believe I'd ever recommend the Nile on a night with a schedule to maintain.  This place does nice leisurely dining well but if you have somewhere to be it could a crapshoot."}
{"text":"Great Arabic food.    Good service and delicious food. I especially like the hummus and falafel.   The location is a nondescript strip mall on Odana, which is nice enough instead but not  that spectacular.   I admit that I'm biased towards Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Set-up: group of 15 for a birthday party, by reservation, and acknowledgement that \"yes, we can handle your large group.\" Smoky (food) atmosphere upon entry. One other large group and maybe 3-4 other small tables occupied.   Great (as in best in Madison): Chicken shawirma - seasoned just right, salt, pepper, cinnamon? or cardamum? paparika.  Tabouli salad - was amazing, but it's the more leafy variety than I've noticed in Madison.  Mostly finely chopped parsley and mint leaves with a sprinkle of bulgar. Falafel - mushy chickpea inside with great crunchy (taste the fryer!) outside.   Decent: Hummus - pretty good, not the best in Madison, basic, just oil over it, nothing fancy Baba ghanoush - not very smoked, but nice and creamy with HEAVY garlic and yogurt Dolma - this might be great, but I personally don't like the grape leaf taste, held together nicely and I wasn't totally put off like I have been at other places. Yellow split pea soup - nice fall flavors Lamb kebob - served on rice, good flavors. Kids all got pita pizza - even the picky eaters ate it.  Bland: Bisara - blended fava beans with chili, parsley, cumin, etc.... just fell flat, like NO seasoning Pita - from a grocery store? definitely not made there. No grill flavor or marks. No seasoning.  Weird: Tomato and feta blended spread - tasted good but more like Italian. No rice or designated pita for the shawirma. Stuffed Filet of Salmon - very big portion, looked like a dutch baby pancake stuffed with salmon, rice, cheese, and lobster cream sauce. The dining companion who ordered it, said it tasted \"great.\" Egyptian Canneloni - Looked like a vegetarian lasagna covered in cheese. tasted \"good.\"  Fail: 20 min wait for drinks - just went to the bar 30 min wait to order 2 hr wait for food to come out!!!!!! Would not give us separate checks - even though we asked BEFORE ordering. Portion size did not match prices. Fraudulently charged 20% automatic on our bill. Exact examples of alcohol tickets (to point out obvious charge FRAUD on the tickets): person #1 - 2 spotted cows ($3.75/one) = $7.94 person #2 - 2 spotted cows = $9.41 person #3 - 1 malbec ($6.50/glass) = $8.54 person #4 - 1 pinot ($7.00/glass) = $ 7.39 And that was just on DRINKS! That we had to walk to the bar! Some paid with cash and other with card. PS. both wine pours were MAYBE 3 oz.  They did give us free baklava for the long wait (after we complained) - but it was not good. I can't believe I'm writing this, but it was bland. No honey, pecan filling could have been anything, and some pieces were burnt.  I won't go back unless I crave that tabouli and shwarmira for lunch. But that's going to be a while. And for those of you reading \"oh that's only because it was a large group,\" I witnessed one couple wait an hour for their food too. Another one waited at least 40 min.  Dear owner - get HELP, you need waiters. And a ventilation system. And be aware of the police for your fraud!"}
{"text":"Been to Nile a few times and the food is always great.   Service could use some improvement.  My friend had to ask for a sauce 3x before they brought it and it was halfway thru our meal.  Also, the waiter brought us one check and did even ask if this was together or separate and walked away.  They were busy so we decided to just give all our cards and have him split it for us.  However, some of us had additional items that when split the check ended up paying for other items.  it wasn't much but still a waiter shoudl always ask."}
{"text":"Read a lot of reviews and saw that service could be an issue but I know the food is great. Haven't eaten there for a couple years because I remember having an issue with them refusing to honor one of their coupons last time I went. However, my craving for their food outweighed my old grudge and I made my way there on Friday night. Their hours state they are open until 9. I arrived at 8:30 and the minute I walked in the server looked shocked, tapped his watch, and barked, \"kitchen is closed!\"  Went to Haveli instead where the servers bend over backwards to make your visit wonderful and the food is amazing. Unfortunately I won't be trying The Nile again. Really, The Nile better fix their customer service issues because the food isn't the issue. People have choices and if you treat people poorly they will not be back."}
{"text":"The flavors were out of this world.  The service is excellent.  I can't wait to go back.  Thanks for a great meal."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great service and awesome food! I especially like their salads and lamb kebabs. Their hummus and bread are amazing as well!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants, if not my favorite! The beef shawarma is so  good I can never decide if I want to eat it, smear it all over my face, or just roll around in it! Oh the hummus humanity! I could eat it for days and be happy about it. Do I recommend The Nile? I insist!"}
{"text":"Food is good but definitely overpriced. I ordered chicken shawarma and extra side of hummus. Chicken Shawarma comes with hummus and a side of pita. I asked if the extra side of hummus would also come with pita and was told it does.  Upon picking up the order, I was told there's only one pita per order. It took them a while to give me the extra pita I was promised.   I gave low ratings because the extra side of hummus ($7) was barely 3-4tbsp of hummus. Their hummus is good but I felt ripped off (especially because they were claiming it doesn't come with pita).   An order of chicken shawarma and hummus came out to be over $23. I've had much better food with greater portions for a much better price."}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  The pita is reminiscent of bread from the village, so that's always a good start.  The service was good, food was fantastic, and it seems very hard to go wrong with what you order here.  I had the sorar, which is a savory 'pastry' filled with ground beef, rice, peas, carrots, and pine nuts.  My dining compatriots had the Lebanese mezza, which comes with a ton of pita and all the dippings you can imagine.    This place deserves a better location.  It's not very bike-friendly to get here unless you brave four-lane, no shoulder Odana for a half-mile."}
{"text":"Wonderfully prepared Mediterranean cuisine with great service in an informal setting, the perfect place for conversation with friends. Although some reviewers complain about the prices, I found the right side of the menu in line with the high quality and superb preparation. Enjoy...!"}
{"text":"I would give The Nile 5 stars but am being a bit whiny in my review... 1) Lulu's (where the head chef of The Nile used to be before opening his own place) was within walking distance of my 'hood.  2)  I miss the small, ever changing Arabic grocery that used to be at Lulu's.  3)  Strip mall dining reminds me of the year I lived in S. Florida.  Which if you've ever had to reside there, you are most likely nodding your head in sorrowful understanding.  The Coco Wawa (spicy chicken dish) is large enough to feed two people.  Best hummus ever... creamy & smooth, just how I love it.  Our waiter happily substituted cous cous for rice/fattush salad for the standard house salad when asked if it was possible (Thank you, again, for being so graciously accomodating!).  The pita was soft & pillowy, appeared to be homemade.  Go there.  Now.  You'll forget you're in a strip mall once inside."}
{"text":"Spread the word about this place because it is DELICIOUS! The staff is always so welcoming and friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys a quiet lunch or dinner. The only thing that I think goes against The Nile is the location. This place should move downtown to increase their customers. Will always come here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today and ordered the hummus and gyro.  Both were very good.  The service was fast and very friendly.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Ate at The Nile last night. It was Memorial Day and the restaurant was quite empty around 6:30 pm. There were four of us and we sat at a nice sized round table right near the bar. No one was at the bar so it felt quiet and private. My partner and I passed on ordering an appetizer but the other couple we were with had the felafel. They loved the patties which were flavorful and not too heavy or dry. It was a good serving to share. All of our entrees were delicious. The special of the evening was a lamb shank cooked in a tomato sauce served with green beans, The meat fell from the bone and was fairly tasty. I thought the sauce could have been more generously seasoned. One of my companions had a salmon dish which she really loved. She had it with rice and salad. Also served was the spinach pie. Four nice sized squares of golden brown stuffed phyllo dough. The filling was light and delicious. I love to cook but this is not something I would make at home. I plan to order this the next time I return.  ....That is if I can hold myself back from ordering the Moussaka. I had eaten this lovely dish before at The Nile and I refused to order anything else. The eggplant is so well seasoned, a bit spicy and topped with an ooey-gooey cheese that is held under a flame to create a slight crust. This was also served with rice.  We left the restaurant with full tummies and a doggie bag. I just ate my eggplant for lunch and it tasted even better the second time around!"}
{"text":"My wife and I discovered The Nile a year ago and fell in love with the food.  Yes, we order the same thing every time (we love the Gyro plate) but have ventured out a few times and everything we have had is amazing.  The Hummus.....who.....best I have ever had.  The owner and staff is friendly and accommodating and, yeah, this is one of our go-to places in the Madison area for greek food.  So why write this review now?   Well, I seem to have little time to review lately but also we went there last night and I want to get the word out about the amazing food and delightful staff.    I know this is a lot different than my normal funny reviews but we love this place and would hate to see it go."}
{"text":"Probably the best middle eastern food in Madison, hands down. I eat shwirma every time and should probably branch out for my own good. But can't help myself. Hummus is the best I've tasted. Glad they are on the west side as I would eat there too often.."}
{"text":"The food is very good, the restaurant is very nice on the inside. The staff are friendly and hospitable. The turkish coffee is very good."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with co-workers and the food was very good. I had the falafel sandwich and ordered a bowl of the Egyptian lentil soup. The soup was wonderful, creamy and flavorful. The sandwich was very good, but it could have had a side of tahini or some additional dressing."}
{"text":"I love this place. Excellent vegetarian and vegan options. I'm partial to the spinach pie (which is surprisingly vegan) and vegetarian platter with hummus, falafel and grape leaves (which are the best in Madison in my opinion).  The only negative to this'd place is that the service can be very slow at times. I've come at off hours when we're the only ones there and it takes too long to even get our waters."}
{"text":"Hidden in a nondescript strip mall is one of the few places in Madison where you can get yourself some decent and authentic Arab cuisine. In fact, if you aren't tucked away in a disheveled strip mall with foam ceilings and a drywall/carpet combo from the 90's, I question your authenticity as a legitimate Arab establishment.  The Nile serves up all of the staples of Egyptian cuisine, typically in a tapas small-plate style. Though this seems to vary wildly on each dish, since a $9 bowl of fatteh (garbanzo bean puree) netted me about 100 times as much food as a $5 plate of hummus.  They also tend to put their own flairs on classic Egyptian dishes, changing them quite a bit from what they should be. The dash of cinnamon in the kibbe (fried meatballs) is original, but it does make me pause for a second and think \"this isn't kibbeh!\" And sometimes I just want regular water without rose extract in it.  I don't know if it's a bad thing. I'm no purist but those dishes tend to get spiced the exact same way over and over throughout history for a reason. On some dishes it's a really welcome spin on a familiar taste, on others I just think \"I just want some damn foul (fava beans) without you adding whatever-the-hell-this-is to it.\""}
{"text":"Ordered takeout for two, both Beef shawarma, Enjoyed it, good flavor, hummus was good, both of us enjoyed the food.  Decor was ok, don't really care if food is decent."}
{"text":"Best gyro in madison. Who would have thought... I havent been here in awhile. I need to check back in."}
{"text":"Love, love, looove the food here.  With a menu full of authentic Mediterranean cuisine, the hardest part will be to decide on what to get.  You also can't really go wrong with anything you pick, as each plate offers a varied selection of food (the hummus and grape leaves are amazing) with full, bold tastes.   The service wasn't the best, but the food more than made up for that.  I highly recommend the kibbee balls and shawirma combination. Expect to have leftovers, because each portion is massive. Most plates also come with some warm, crispy pita bread.  For an unique dining experienced filled with interesting flavors, definitely give The Nile a chance."}
{"text":"We were a party of five. Had the mix grill for four and there was plenty to eat. The lamb, beef and shrimp kebab were very juicy and good. The chicken kebab was a bit dry. The hummus, red pepper and baba ganush was awesome. The service was wonderful as well. We had the rice pudding and it was a distinct flavor. Orange blossom and rose water!!!!"}
{"text":"Got delivery food when a family member was sick at home. Delivery guy was perfectly on time, was very nice and helpful and gave us bottled water as a thank you for free! The food was all DELICIOUS and we got enough to feed six people. We had the mezze and all the sauces were amazing. The lamb was moist and fall apart, the couscous was fluffy and the chicken shawarma was perfectly spiced."}
{"text":"An average good Mediterranean restaurant.  I came in here for the first time with a friend who has never had Mediterranean food and it was a perfectly acceptable first time experience for her.  She had the sorar and while a bit on the dry side - she liked it! She also enjoyed her first baba ganouj and tabbouleh experiences. I stuck my fork in her baba ganouj and it really was the star of the entire dining experience.  Some of the best I've had! I went with the lamb kebab and it was disappointing- dry, without much flavor.  The grilled tomato was awesome, more than one slice would have been wonderful! The rice was fine, and the hummus was very good.  Service wasn't very friendly and he kitchen was a bit on the slow side.  I'm not sure I'd rush back, but my friend enjoyed her first experience with Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food so when I heard about this place, I had to try it and came here with friends for dinner. I ordered the chicken shawarma with grape leaves (a favorite of mine). It came with a salad, which had a lot of spices and made the dressing very strong. The chicken, hummus, and dolmades were delicious. My friend ordered a sizable spinach salad with chicken and the chicken was top notch, but the salad was a little bland.  Overall, I enjoyed the food but it was a little pricey for dinner and the salad dressing could have been better."}
{"text":"We went to Nile for lunch. We were a party of two. The restaurant was empty except us. The server was a middle-aged man with a surly attitude. I don't think that he was an employee. He behaved more like an owner/manager. He was quite brusque while taking our order. The food arrived soon enough but we were disappointed to find it mediocre at best. Such horrible service for below average food! We weren't very pleased with our experience so when the check came we left only 10% tip. Never in my entire life have I ever seen a server coming to collect tips before the customer leaves the restaurant but this man not only comes to our table to collect his tip but he very rudely points out that we have given him much less than he \"deserves\", and that we should atleast leave him 20%! We were obviously shocked! We increased the tip to 15% and quietly walked out of the restaurant. This whole experience left such a sour taste in our mouth that we didn't even bother to take home the leftovers. We always tip as best as we can when we are happy with the service but this whole episode was awkward and embarassing. We decided never to go back. There's no shortage of good Mediterranean restaurants in Madison and way too many average ones. Nile was definitely not worth the humiliation."}
{"text":"This place just knocks it out of the park every visit.  My family always gets the chicken couscous and the kefta kabob.  Both dishes are always fantastic and are accompanied by a generous portion of pita bread as well as a soup of your choice.  We favor the spinach lentil soup."}
{"text":"With one of my favorite restaurants being Kabul downtown, I was slightly skeptical of coming to another Mediterranean place. However, The Nile quickly eliminated any lingering doubts. I had the Chicken Shawirma, and the combination of flavors was amazing. Also, the Spinach Lentil soup was one of the best soups I've ever had! I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I had never had Mediterranean food before aside from gyros and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was great and the staff was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good. I had the Shawirma and my vegan brother had some manner of vegetarian combo. I found the Shawirma to be very flavorful, and the two of us agreed that the dipping sauce they had--whatever it was, something with sesame?--was really good. Brother also generally favored the food, although he preferred his lentil soup on the spicy side rather than the sour side.  Food is definitely their strong point. I get mixed messages from their image. Their website seems to have been taken over by a URL parker. The menu has typos in dish names and fails to specify important things about dishes like the fact that you could order the Shawirma with chicken or beef. I went to use the bathroom, and the waiter apologized for the fact that they hadn't totally gotten everything set up yet an hour after opening time (to be fair, it was New Year's Day) and stumbled around to turn on the lights in a dark hallway leading to the bathroom.  I'm all for hole-in-the-wall restaurants, but entrees with meat run at about $17 here, and little appetizer plates are about $6.... I'd come again with my brother for the food, but probably wouldn't choose this place if I'm eating with anyone less dorky than my brother."}
{"text":"The best hummus in town!  Everything is always tasty.  The service is good.  My husband's favorite dish is the Nile Chicken."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch and had an excellent experience.  Don't let the strip mall location fool you; this place doesn't disappoint.  The middle eastern coffee was great and we shared a few small plates for our meal.  The beef shawarma is absolutely the best I've ever had!  The falafel, hummus, and lentil soup were flavorful and fresh.  We've been dreaming of the flavors we had since we stopped in.  Can't wait to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner - as a guy who has had a lot of middle estern food in his life - I gotta say the food was really good - especially the Kefteh kabob. The prices are a bit expensive, and there is only one waiter (but that worked fine for us as there weren't that many people there) With that said, it is good food and good atmosphere/decor. Would go here again. If they changed their prices a bit, It would attract a lot more customers."}
{"text":"We had the house specialty for two: lamb, chicken, beef, and shrimp with hummus, tabouli, and bread was excellent and a fair deal for the price.  Back bottom of menu.  Will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Fresh food, decent prices, and decently sized portions. Went here one Saturday afternoon late and no one else was there. The waiter was friendly. We got a tabouleh salad with chicken and a few appetizers. The salad was large and fresh tasting. The apps were a bit overpriced for what they were."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals, hands down, that I have had in a long time! Service was great, Said is the mgr and he is so nice! We had the baba ganoush, mohamara, and schweirma, just perfect! If you are in this area, you absolutely should try Nile."}
{"text":"Good God, don't go to this place. The food is okay, but the owner is incredibly rude and there are better places for Mediterranean food in town - I'd pick Oliva any day of the week. Overpriced and bad service. Spend your money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Meh. Not worth a trip. Funny tasting water.  Not good"}
{"text":"I have never written a single negative review on Yelp. Until now.  The food is decent, though higher priced than most Mediterranean restaurants in Madison. Even the service was fine. So what could cause me to speak ill of this place?  For a dinner for two, we ordered $35 of food. I went to sign off on the check and saw that the total price was somehow $43. What? How can this be? Drinks? No, Didn't buy them. Sales Tax? No way, it's not that high here. I pulled our waiter aside and asked what the deal was.  The man had the audacity to tell me that the chip in my credit card made it impossible to tip after running the card. So, the logical thing to do was add a 20% gratuity. Instead of asking me what to tip, just assume your service was superb and hope the customer doesn't notice. Perhaps you're jumping on the no-tip restaurant wagon? Except there's one little problem...  Your written gratuity policy was 18% for parties of 6 or more. How did you come up with 20% for two people? Make sure you tell whatever poor customer you gouge next about the gratuity. They might actually come back.  I, on the other hand, will be telling everyone I know to stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"We got a gift certificate from a friend for this place and we just loved it!  The service was pretty good and the food is great.  The decor is nice and it's usually not crowded.  It can get a little cold at times, especially sitting near the door, but overall very comfortable.    The feta and olives appetizer is super yummy.  We love the stuffed salmon and lamb couscous.  The food comes out bubbling hot and is very flavorful.  Perfect amount of spice.  Prices are reasonable.  The service was fast and very friendly.  Actually, the staff seem genuinely happy - which you don't often encounter in food service.      It is tucked away off Odana near Research Pkwy.  Easy to miss as you drive by, but totally worth it.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great menu. location is out of the way, but place is very clean and easy to get to.  Parking is totally convienent. Music, decor was on par. Good service, extremely polite. Menu was solid. Hummus was so-so. Pita was good. Had the grilled platter for 2 and loved it. Water was infused with orange blossom, always a nice touch."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed based on some glowing reviews of the food. (With respect to service, it is definitely a good idea to call ahead to make sure the kitchen will be open. They say they're open until 9 but the kitchen clearly closes at 8 on slower nights, so you'll be SOL if you show up a minute past then.) The food was incredibly bland; didn't expect to have to throw a ton of talk and pepper into a couscous dish, but it didn't seem to have any herbs or other seasoning. The same was true of other appetizers. Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. Our waiter was extremely friendly and was helpful in guiding the menu. Food was good, nice and hot. I will be back again."}
{"text":"The food is good here. We however had the weirdest interaction with the waiter. He demanded that we pay him 15% tips. The amount we had put in was only lower by a few cents and he somehow though it was OK to demand that we add it. They have definitely lost me as a customer."}
{"text":"The food is really salty but delicious! I recommend the mezze to eat as a group family style. The moussaka is to die for but very rich. The baba ganoush and hummus are seriously legit. The soups are good too. The wait staff is very nice!"}
{"text":"Really yummy food!  We had the Mixed Grill for two and really enjoyed it!  The hummus was very tasty.  It's not five star because of the service. A smile everyone once in awhile would have gone a long way. But the food was good enough that we'll be back!"}
{"text":"As far as flavors go, this is my favorite restaurant.  It won't win any awards for being fancy, but the food is just amazing.  I sampled almost everything on their menu, including quite a few of their specials and have never been disappointed.  Every time I go I find it incredibly difficult to choose something, because everything is so good.  Their baba ghanoush is the best I've ever had.  And the staff is always attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison! Amazing baba ghanoush, delicious yellow pea soup, perfectly cooked chicken and beef... I can't say enough good things about this place. The people are friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is peaceful."}
{"text":"I went here with two dining companions.  One who is your typical knuckle dragging, meat eater Wisconsinite, (let the flaming begin) and one who is on the fence between vegetarianism and eating things that had a face.    Our meat eater had a spicy hamburger dish served atop hummus.  He didn't like it, and he wouldn't ever go back of his own free will.      The fence rider had the same thing I had which was the vegetarian delight, consisting of hummus, stuffed grape leaves, and falafel.  She tried all three but only really ate the falafel and copious amounts of pita bread dipped in oil.    I really enjoyed my plate, apparently I was the odd one out this time around.  But it was a refreshing change from the usual pizza/burger/steak joints found all over the place.    Service was exceptional!"}
{"text":"We just ordered food here tonight for the first time.  Food was great!  The chicken was so tender and delicious. Hummus and pita also very good.   Only thing we were a little surprised rice wasn't included.  That would if made it five stars.    I'm sure we will order again."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and authentic. I tried falafel and stuffed grape leaves which were very tasty."}
{"text":"Food = Amazing.  Would definitely return for any and all of the food I had, but especially the hummus and lamb kebab!   Service = Having a large group of 10, sitting at a table with lots of space to move around, it was a bit frustrating that our server only communicated and dished out drinks and dishes from one end of the table. It was difficult to hear, and I felt I had to shout my order down the table. Not my favorite style of service.  Atmosphere = My least favorite part of The Nile was that their ventilation seemed to be poor throughout the restaurant. While I didn't notice when we first arrived, eventually the dining area filled with a smoky haze that smelled of cooking oils. Not incredibly appealing!  Ease of Reservation = Almost too easy... I called one to two weeks ahead to reserve a large table for UW Graduation weekend. Staff who answered my call asked for my name and the number of guests. It was a quick exchange, so I worried that the reservation might get lost. Called to confirm two days ahead, and staff on the line took down more information. Once we arrived, we were quickly seated. My advice, especially with large parties, it's worth a call to confirm if you booked a decent amount in advance!  All in all, the food is very much worth the trip."}
{"text":"Four stars for the amazing food. The fifth star not given for the price.  Ok, so I've been dining here for awhile. I almost always go around lunch time. They're almost always dead. Either my group is the only group or there's only one other. It's sad, because they're really good. More people need to know about this place. I've tried spreading the word, but my friends never seem to be interested in checking it out. I've only gotten a few people to eat here, but when they do they're hooked!  I wish I could remember the first sandwich I got here. I keep trying to figure it out, but I never have been able to. It was easily one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. Every other sandwich has been fantastic, so my exploration of the menu hasn't been a bad one.  One of my favorite things here is the rose or lavender water, depending on the day. I love it so much. I had to go out and get a bottle of rose water so that I could have it at home.  The look of the place is great. I envy the fancy section that seems to be closed off during the day. I would love to be able come back here some time for the belly dancing, but I always end up going to the hookah lounge."}
{"text":"3.5 is about right.  It's pretty good Mediterranean/middle eastern food for Madison.  The baba is pretty good, and you can usually get a table without waiting and they serve you pretty quick.  I go back from time to time (or did before we moved away)."}
{"text":"I reserved judgement on this restaurant until tonight, my third trip.  I've had some dishes that were misses, but the vast majority of Nile's menu is outstanding.  I was particularly fond of the fool moudamas, and have been hoping that they'll repeat their stuffed artichoke special which absolutely blew my mind.  Some restaurants aren't good enough to get you to come back for a known menu item, this one is good enough to lure you back with the mere hope that a special is on, which really says something."}
{"text":"Great authentic atmosphere....considering the strip mall appearance on the outside.  You would never know this hidden gem was here when you drive down Odana.  The service was good-normal.  The food was pretty good, but very very expensive.  They range from $15-19.  Will be back when I'm craving Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"We went recently and found the food okay. I had kibbeh with the lentil soup and my wife had the beef swadharma. I felt first off walking into the place that we were not a priority. While I enjoyed the soup, the lentils were mushy. I grew up eating middle eastern food from an excellent native cook. Her lentil soup was never mushy. I found the kibbeh to be dry and over cooked, but the tabouli and yogurt sauce was very good. My wife's beef swadharma (sp?) was okay and tasted quite gamey. We are not planning on returning, it was too expensive for food that's just okay."}
{"text":"Best falafel I've ever had. Excellent service, the food came out fast, and overall it was an awesome experience. This has now become our favorite spot in town!"}
{"text":"No real opinion on the food- but the manager/owner was a real tool on the phone when I tried to place a catering order.  We had a misunderstanding about whether or not he could accept my business at the price I could pay (his English on the phone was not good enough to make himself clear) and when I called back to ensure I understood correctly, he got upset and heated with me. By contrast, I called Swagat immediately after this and was taken care of handsomely.  Nile may be a fine restaurant, but the owner seems to think he can pick and choose when he treats customers with respect.  **EDIT- after reading other one-star reviews, it seems clear that Nile has an ongoing problem with rudeness to customers, poor service, and adding shady 20% gratuities to the bill.  Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"Good as fuck mediterranean food, especially the hummus. A bit expensive for what you are getting. Fast service.   There is a reason the service is fast: it's a fucking ghost town. I have never seen more than 1/3 of the restaurant filled. I don't know how they manage to stay in business but it's fine by me as long as they keep pumping out the falafels."}
{"text":"Excelent mediterranean food  A friend from Egipt recommended me this restaurant. The flavors and foods is very good.  I recommend \"the mix\" is a combination of different kind of beef"}
{"text":"Not a bad little Mediterranean joint. Service is so so. I actually prefer the appetizers and the baklava to the main dishes. The lentil soup and hummus are standouts. Did I mention the baklava."}
{"text":"Recommended by a friend and I'm glad because I never really noticed the restaurant in the little strip mall when I've been down Odana.  The food was just really, really good! The hummas was so fresh and the pita soft and warm.  The shawirma was good, the lamb kebobs, grape leaves--all of it!  We were too stuffed for dessert this time but will go back again.  It's no more expensive than Bunky's and the food is better. Love it!"}
{"text":"For their sake, I wish their decor was a little more modern, and the menus more descriptive and professionally done, but the food is outstanding."}
{"text":"Very good, period. Visiting from NM and having grown up in Detroit, it's fair for me say I certainly know good middle-eastern food from bad. The pea soup was excellent. The hummus was also very good. I had the center cut lamb chops and a skewer of shrimp, also excellent. My only very small observation was the pita bread. I prefer the smaller freshly naked square pockets verses the heavier style they serve. Not a deal breaker - just what I'm use to from Detroit. I'd go back here in a heartbeat and I sincerely recommend the Nile as well."}
{"text":"Our waiter was great! He timed his visits to our table perfectly. I noticed another couple who wanted to eat faster and he helped them in a different manner than us with expert ease.   The food was SO good and very fast from the kitchen! I had lamb with rice and hummus and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"We always likes the food. However: when you try to pay with credit card, they apply 20% tip without asking you!!!!  And when you pay attention ( as your bill and receipt are not the same) they are telling a story about \"computer issues\". Please - let me decided what level of tip I would like to add to my bill and for SURE never add it without asking me. I'm not sure it's even legal."}
{"text":"The billing practices here are shady as heck. My girlfriend and I were automatically charged a 20? gratuity, even though it was only two of us, and I only knew this because it was on our itemized bill. No signage, no verbal warning, not on the menu. The waiter also hung around after handing us the check, so I handed him my payment quickly, only seeing the added tip out of sheer luck. After we got the check back to sign, the itemized receipt (which showed the added tip) was gone. The receipt to sign had a tip line, too. Very misleading, and other reviews confirm that this isn't unusual. I will not be taking my money here again.  As for the food, the split pea soup was great and the meats were pretty good, too, but the lentil soup and the couscous were strangely sour. My girlfriend's hummus had a very bitter aftertaste as well."}
{"text":"Decent food. Not that impressive I must say based on the great reviews. Portion sizes are relatively small compared to the prices. The pita bread was dry and didn't have any flavor. Unfortunately, I cannot recall the name of the dish I ordered but it it was a chicken dish in this red sauce with potatoes, and peas. It came with a side of rice. The pea to sauce portion was overwhelming. While I am OK with eating them, it consumed the dish far too much for my liking. I would love to give The Nile another try but have not desire to go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This Mediterranean restaurant was amazing.  Our waiter was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the food.  We ordered the fattoush salad, which was pretty good.  We thought it was a bit sour, but still enjoyable. With that came pita bread with this amazing dip - olive oil with spices and sesame seeds.  I have no clue what was in that but it was simply divine!  My future mother-in-law wanted Majadra but the menu didn't have it.  When asked, the waiter said that they didn't have this dish because not a lot of people enjoyed the garlic sauce that came with it (who doesn't like garlic?!?!?!!) but he did recommend a dish that was very similar to the Majadra, which she very much enjoyed. She also ordered the Split Pea soup, which she said was delicious. My future father-in-law ordered the Egyptian Canneloni, which was very tasty, a bit too much cheese for me (but I have high cholesterol so I can't enjoy those types of dishes too much), but the taste I had, put atop a piece of pita bread was delicious. The accompanying Lentil soup he ordered was quite enjoyable as well. My fiance ordered the Musakka with Bechamel, which again, amazing.  I ordered the Spinach Pie, my first time, and was impressed with the melody of flavors.  We didn't get dessert because we were satisfying full after the appetizers. THe water is flavored with orange-blossom flowers. A very pleasant surprise.  The atmosphere was casual and intimate, which was great.  I would come back to eat here."}
{"text":"Ate in. They've done a nice job with what's essentially an open space. Music playing overhead but not overpowering. Had the shrimp kabob with pita. Love the warm pita and hummus. Marinated shrimp had a nice flavor, no mud vein, but still had skin/legs on, which was unexpected. Didn't peel it because then I'd lose the spice. Rice was nicely and subtly flavored, a good compliment. Companion had salmon kabob which was flavored nicely but seemed a little dry. Decent price, although I think we end up with more food at Banzo."}
{"text":"It was an impulsive decision to go to The Nile when were hunting for new restaurant in the area we never tried before.  I had my doubts when we arrive in a small complex and the simple sign of the restaurant. But this is the incident where one should not judge an eatery from its facade. They definitely worth trying.  Pro: - Amazing hummus! (definitely an important indicator for me when going to Mediterranean restaurants) - Good service  Con: - Limited menu during the weekends (no sandwiches, just FYI)  I ordered a combination of platter for two, which consists of assortments of meats, shrimps served over yellow jasmine rice. It also comes with pita breads and hummus, as well as a soup as appetizer.  All the food taste very fresh and authentic - particularly the hummus and soups. We tried both the split pea soup, and lentil soup - both did not disappoint. They also provide equal portion for each meat, which is easy to split between my friend and I.  I gave 4 stars, just because the meats was a tad dry to my liking. Overall, it is a great place to visit if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the one star reviews. I went with a group of four on a Saturday night and had a very pleasant experience.   We began with the vegetarian delight (in the vegetarian entree section). The falafel was crispy and seasoned well. The hummus was creamy. The tabouleh was fresh.  The best dish was the chicken shawarma. The flavor on the chicken was incredible- 7 spices go on it! It's not hot, just crazy flavorful.  The kibbe was dry. Ground beef with spices and onion.   My eggplant moussaka was flavorful- soft eggplants, béchamel, light tomato sauce, and lots of cheese. It came with a side of rice. I enjoyed it and have lunch for tomorrow. Lots of food!   The restaurant was not busy, probably because the Badgers were playing! The service was prompt.   The menu states parties of 6 will be charged  a 20%  gratuity. The reviews saying parties under 6 got charged the gratuity or overcharged for drinks were concerning. I did not have any problems with the bill. Good to double check your bill wherever you go though."}
{"text":"I love the Nile! The food is yummy and has a number of selections for vegetarians. The only negative that I can say is that the delivery food is not up to par with the food you get dining in."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant for a weekend dinner. Finger licking mediterranean food :) I ordered the vegetarian platter with hummus, baba ganoush and falafel along with yellow peas soup. Pita was soft and freshly made. Everything tasted awesome. The service was quick and good.  Only thing I didn't like was the flavored water. I think it's some authentic thing but personally didn't like it and no one gave the alternative of plain water. Other than that very good place. Will go again !!"}
{"text":"It would be easy to overlook this restaurant in a small strip mall on Odana - but don't! This is our favorite middle eastern restaurant by far - very authentic. (I was told this is the same family that had Lulu's on Old University.) If in doubt try the mezze for 2 or 4 which is a great selection of classic dishes. Lots of vegetarian options and great prices. Never very busy. Ample parking. Great for families."}
{"text":"I love the food  in the Nile. I recommend the falafel and grape leaves. Grape leaves look like they are made in house and are served warm.  The lamb is delicious and my favorite meat in this place. Overall the food is good and fresh."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day and my mother and I were starving. I checked yelp to see what we were nearby that was good. The Nile showed up right next to where we were. It was Mediterranean and super close by. When we got there the place was open but empty. The server was eating at one of the tables , I think we might've interrupted his lunch. Once he saw that we were entering he quickly sat us and quickly took our order. Everything was very quick. The hummus was yummy. I had never heard of Egyptian cannoli so I had to try it. It was phenomenal! While the service was decent, it kind of felt like he was trying to rush us out of there. I would definitely go back as the food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Food is good and fresh but kind of over priced. $5.50 for a tiny plate of hummus with one piece of pita cut up is a bit extreme. The average cost of making hummus in bulk is around $0.95. Fill the plate up.   Expect dinner prices to be between $12-22. Vegetarian dishes are all $11.95 and are quite filling, but I'd have loved to try the lamb or chicken. $16.95 a plate is just a bit much, if the vegetarian portions are anything to judge off of.   We were the only two diners, which was slightly daunting, but we did come in right between the lunch and dinner rush, around 3:30-4pm. So service was good.   All in all I'd return, but we came under the expectation that the price would be lower. On yelp it shows as $$ when realistically it's closer to $$$. However, that's a yelp problem, not the restaurant. Plates between $11-$30 are not 2 dollar signs. Their reasonable price and mine differ greatly."}
{"text":"I adore everything about this restaurant. I came here the other day with my parents, and everything was amazing.  To start off, the decor of The Nile is adorable and fits with the theme of the restaurant. The baba ghanoush is superb as well as their hummus.  The Nile also has a great variety of foods for every bodies dietary needs. They have seafood and meat to vegetarian options.  The service was also top notch. My parents and I felt extremely taken care of. This is the best place for middle eastern food in madison"}
{"text":"Yummy hummus, tasty salad, flavorful chicken shawarma.  And the bread is more like naan, rather than pita from the bag that was sliced into pretty little triangles.   Went for dinner carryout. Wish I would have went for lunch I would have saved a few bucks. I think my chicken shawarma came out to 14 bucks (ouch!).  My sister ordered the a vegetarian dish, falafel, hummus and baba ghanoush - from her empty plate, I imagine she liked it. I'll go for the lunch next time, hoping it will be cheaper yet filling for my tummy."}
{"text":"VERY BAD experience. DO NOT Go Be aware of the scam. Don't go. It was my first time, where the 4 of us went to have dinner over there. Surprised when I looked at the check and found that extra charges were added. First, extra charges were added for choosing salads from the types the waiter mentioned. Why this was not explained to us when we placed our order (first scam)? However, the big one is that they added a default \"Service charge of 20%\" (Note: this is not tip. This is an obligatory service charge). The menu mentions that there is this service charge for parties of 5 or more. Ok, we are 4. Why did you add this extra $22? The waiter smartly replied, because you ordered food for six people (4 dishes and 2 sides). Wow! When I explained to him that this is not logical and 'parties of 5 or more' means 5 people, not five dishes, he got mad, started shouting, told me this is mandatory; otherwise I have to clean my dishes! Very rude and ugly way to talk to customers. Actually, I felt the guy is mentally unstable, so I called the police. At this point, his partner changed tone, corrected the receipt and brought me the right one. I paid the tips I wanted to pay from the beginning, not because he terrorized me, but because this is what I usually do anyway. However, the take-home message here is that these guys are ruining the system in which business is conducted in this country. They exercise a corrupted system of ripping off and insulting customers, something they brought from their home countries. They depend on naïve customers who do not pay attention to itemized charges in the check and pay whatever the waiter asks them to pay. This was the first and last time to go to this restaurant. I encourage each one to avoid this restaurant, or if put in a similar situation to exercise his/her rights and not allow such people to ruin our country. Please spread the message or even file a complaint at the customer protection department to have this business shut down due to violations of customer rights."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to a delightful meal what I got instead was a nightmare I ordered through GrubHub the food came cold we had specifically said no onions there were onions all over the plate the portions I have never seen such a small portion on a gyro plate that one for $15.99 the food was awful the gyro meat was flavorless and chopped up it would not fill an entire pita sandwich for 899 at Rosati's you can get an incredible girl when the manager was confronted he was absent it and belligerent finally he said he would refund our money but only if we never ate there again truly not a problem I would never leave here if it were the only place open in Madison"}
{"text":"Ok service and food. Visited thanks to the reviews. The food was about standard nothing over the top.  Expected a lot more from this place according to the reviews."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying that this was my FIRST time eating in a Middle Eastern restaurant.  I had lunch with a friend who educated me on the various dishes.  For appetizers, I tried Hummus for the first time, and it was okay. I tried my friend's rolled grape leaves filled with rice and spices. She has had it before, and LOVES them, although they didn't do anything for me.  We both opted for the Egyptian Lentil soup.  I was surprised at how much I liked it, but to me it was just \"pea soup\".  I had the Jerusalem Salad, and was pleased at the tasty, crispy bits of green pepper, onion, tomato, and cucumber.  The yogurt sauce and tahini dressing dominated the salad, and it was okay for something I'd never had before.  My main dish was Musakka With Béchamel. This was my favorite part of the meal.  It was a nice blend of onion, eggplant, and spices, in a light tomato sauce covered wth bechemal.    We finished our meal with some Mint Tea (to aid in digestion). I'm not a coffee or tea drinker, so was really trying something new.  I put some honey in mine to make it even sweeter, and found the tea okay.  Although for a first time foray into Middle Easter dining, it went well (I liked the taste of everything except the rolled grape leaves), I found the food blander than I am used to.  (But I DID purposefully choose Vegetarian options so was not surprised at this).  The server was a little gruff, but not rude.  We stayed for a long lunch and did not feel pressured to leave sooner, which was nice.  My friend (who has health issues regarding food) asked for one ingredient to be left out of her meal, and for 2 other ingredients not to touch each other on the plate.  She was told there would be an extra $3 fee to accommodate that request.  We were both taken a little aback by that."}
{"text":"Always fast and friendly service. Food is delicious and quantities are large. Have some rose water, enjoy wonderful cuisine in a cute, cozy setting!"}
{"text":"Spinach pie and shrimp in tomato sauce excellent. Good selection of wine at a reasonable price. Good service. Fatuoush salad minty. Great house salad.Recommended."}
{"text":"The food at the Nile was ok. Their falafels were pretty good though I wish they were served with hummus instead of the tasteless yogurt sauce. Their hummus is also pretty good though the rice that came with the chicken kebab was REALLY salty. The chicken was tender with ok flavor - missing some taste.   BEWARE - we were charged a 20% gratuity for lunch for 3 people. I have never seen that before for 3. Yes, it is more common for groups of 6 or more but this was weird.   We will never go back."}
{"text":"When they closed Husnu's, we began our quest for Mediterranean food in Madison.  Our search continues.  We were not impressed at The Nile.  The only lamb available on the lunch menu is ground with beef.  I was offered lamb but for twice the cost and off the dinner menu.  The hummus was tasteless.  THe waiter was not well informed on what they serve.  We will not return."}
{"text":"I went here as a part of the vegan meetup group.   Food was excellent. Dinner included one of the best soups I can remember having (some kind of spicy split pea with an incredible depth of flavor) and a zesty, minty salad drizzled in olive oil. Main courses were a) some kind of zucchini in an oily tomato sauce, b) fava bean stew, c) falafel with hummus, and d) some kind of spinach/ phyllo dish. There was also pita served with the meal.  The zucchini had a great flavor, and while oily, it was not a bad \"oily.\" I'm not sure that I would want to eat a whole plate of it but, alongside the rest of the food it had a very fresh, very delicious flavor. The fava beans were by far the best entree, a salty and smoky stew that was very hearty. The spinach pie was definitely an acquired taste--some kind of exotic flavor within the filling that was hard to place and which my girlfriend did not care for--but I ate two helpings. The falafel was amazing, very crisp outside and moist, well-seasoned inside. Maybe as good as Bunky's.   We were also served a delicious baklava dessert, although the coffee was sadly a bit burnt. My girlfriend had the tea, however, which she described as excellent.   The service was very good--extremely attentive and willing to please, almost excessively so. It has a much nicer atmosphere inside than you would expect from the strip-mall interior.   All in all, very good food. Would recommend."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I really wanted to try this place. We went for lunch on a Saturday. Imagine my surprise that there is no lunch menu and lunch was going to set me back a minimum of $15! I ordered an appetizer of falafel, which was the best thing I had, but an additional $5.95. The entree was chicken schwirma, with a side of hummus. I thought the main portion was small and came without rice? That was weird to me, never had it that way before. I even inquired and was just told \"no, it does not come with rice\". No offer to bring me rice. There was one man waiting on the entire place. He seemed a little distracted and maybe irritated, but was cordial to us. I doubt I will go back, I have had better Mediteranean food elsewhere and for less money."}
{"text":"In short:  Poor service Decent food  The experience was odd, when we arrived for lunch at 1pm, we were given dinner menus. Then when seated and after we had decide what we wanted to order, our party of 3 was informed that there was an obligatory 20% gratuity, despite the back of the menu saying this only applied to parties of 6 or more.  While I certainly don't have a problem tipping for good service, I can't can help but feel that I was somewhat misled. Any such requirements should have been stated ahead of time, not been contrary to the menu and should not have been mentioned when we were placing orders.  The food quality was slightly above average, however the portions were smaller than what we expected - especially for dinner rates. While the rates were somewhat reasonable, I couldn't help walking away feeling squeezed for money.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended, but failed to meet expectations. Above average food but sub par service. We were also told that the 'suggested' tip amount on the bill, which was too much for the service we received, was the minimum tip we needed to pay."}
