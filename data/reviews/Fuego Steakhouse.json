{"text":"There for dinner and had the pan seared ribeye. Cooked to perfection. Cream brulee for dessert. Wonderful meal. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe with how many times my husband and I choose this as our date night establishment that I've yet to do a review. Decor: is dark and probably reminiscent of when this casino was owned for a different company and jungle themed in the 90's. You've noticed I haven't deducted any stars for it however, this decor for this particular restaurant just works! Staff: friendly and attentive. They seem to have stolen burger kings tag line- \"You can have it your way.\" Extra dipping sauce for steak, extra popovers, if they have em, you can have em. Speaking of popovers- their breadbasket is the best thing they have going for them, and that means a lot! Since I've already, and continue to, praise them. Food: my pet peeve at a steak house is the cooking temperature being off. You should know blindfolded how to cook rare, medium rare, medium, medium well, and well. This place? Perfect every time! What else can I squeeze into this review: If you're a French onion soup fanatic like me- try theirs- still one point below Applebee's (I don't know why they are my fave they just are) but really good here. I don't know if it's permanent or not, but for 9 months since we've been going, they do a great 3 course special- soup or salad, limited but satisfactory entree selection, and two dessert options- bread pudding and creme brûlée. Not being a bread pudding fan I can't speak for it because I've never tried it. But the creme brûlée- AH-MAY-ZING! perfect ending to your dinner.  Now all Fiesta Henderson needs is a Kids Quest so I don't have to get a babysitter each time."}
{"text":"It's great to find a new favorite restaurant close to home. My wife loves the scallops and I love the prime rib. Great service & food at reasonable prices.. Highly recommend!!  Enjoy.."}
{"text":"We received a discount coupon for dinner at the Fuego. Since we had been there before Stations Casino purchased the location 8 years ago. My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the sea scallops. Prior to ordering the sea scallops I asked the waitress if the scallops were wet or dry, and if they were wet to change my order to my wife's choice. Upon returning to our table the waitress informed me that the scallops were dry (fresh - not frozen). You can imagine my surprise when the meal was served the scallops were completely covered with a slurry of some kind. Completely covering the scallops. I reminded her that I ordered pan seared scallops and not the soup she brought to the table. She apologized and said she would take care of it. I reminded her again that I did not want wet scallops. If they did not have fresh scallops please change my order to steak. About a half hour later, after my wife had already eaten, she returned with the scallops which appeared to have a sear on them. Upon close examination the visual sear was simply pieces of black pepper to give the appearance of a sear. The flavor was off thus verifying the scallops were frozen not fresh or dry. This was an hour after we had originally placed our order and they finally brought out a steak for me.   Conclusion: Don't order seafood from a casino. Don't believe them when they obviously don't care enough to tell the truth. Don't ever return to a restaurant where the cook thinks he can outsmart the customer. Don't patronize a business that offers no apology for their mistakes. Don't reward them with your business when they are only interested in taking you money; in this case about $85.00 -   Another casino food service with out a separate kitchen and chef for the fine(?) dining area. The service was ok but not up to the level required for the amount charged. Save your money and frustration and pass on this place.   The steaks were very good but not worth waiting so long for. Overall what a disappointment."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here for their prime rib special and ended up getting the wine, lyonnaise potatoes, and lava cake with ice cream as well. Typical. Ha! Anyways, the food was great and the service was wonderful. Definitely coming back here again the next time that I visit my sister."}
{"text":"This place is excellent.  Great Food.  Great Service.  And for those steak lovers out there, they actually knew what \"Pittsburgh\" style was and did it perfect.  A little hidden gem for those of us who love steak but don't want to mortgage the house.  I'm not sure if us locals know about this place, but spread the word.  P.S. I am not family, friends or involved in any way with this place.  I'm just happy I found it."}
{"text":"Actually, this is one of the better steak places in town. Took the wife there this evening, and it was nothing short of awesome!  As soon as we walked in we were greeted with a smile and a warm greeting by the hostess. We were immediately seated, and given water and bread. Not many restaurants still do water.  We each ordered the $24 three course meal. I got the sirloin, and my wife got the prime rib. Cooked to perfection! The clam chowder was absolutely full of clams. I only wish the bowl was bigger!  The entire wait staff did an outstanding job from start to finish.   Awesome food with awesome service.  I'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, great prices, friendly service.  We had the pan roast (best I ever had - the seafood wasn't overcooked) and a perfectly-cooked ribeye. The bread basket was amazing, the crime brûlée was awesome as was the cheesecake. Even the coffee was great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a true hidden gem. It sits behind a bar tucked away in the casino.  We've eaten there a few times and the food has always been incredible. I usually do the filet and add the lobster tail. My fiance gets the ribeye and its always delicious.   We just celebrated our 10 year anniversary here and it was perfect. After oysters, 2 steaks, 2 lobster tails and a decent bottle of wine our bill was less than $200.   The only thing that isn't always on point is the service, which is sometimes a little frustrating, because it's never packed.  But for food quality and ambiance you definitely get more bang for buck here."}
{"text":"Customer service was excellent by all staff members.  Filet mignon and lobster were cooked to perfection. I really like how they offer to cut your lobster off the shell for you. Saves me the trouble! Porterhouse steak was so large and juicy looking.  Our waiter was such a gentleman and was very attentive to our table needs from water to just anything so we didn't have to hound him like some places.  Fuego's is tucked inside Fiesta Casino next to Amigo's restaurant.  Ambiance was relaxing and I loved my Shirley Temple drink.  Chocolate cake was a nice big slice and the crème brulee was so delicious I ended up eating all of it instead of taking it home."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical to go to Fuego at the Fiesta, but my grandparents swore up and down that it was amazing. So they took my family and I there for a family steak dinner.   It was actually really nice to my suprise.   I order the filet mignon of course- and I was not dissapointed at all. It was so tender and juicy, the flavor was amazing- and it melted in my mouth (like any properly cooked filet should)  Thank god I didn't have the foot the bill at the end of the night :)"}
{"text":"Excellent filet, flame cooked, tender and delicious. Second time here and still excellent. One of my favorite steak houses in Vegas. A great bargain. Potato, veggie, salad comes with the meat. Immediate seating usually available without a reservation. Staff is super friendly and service is fast. This gem will be a regular for us for years to come."}
{"text":"Great place for the money, awesome food and atmosphere, rivals many higher priced places on quality.  Only gripe was they were out of a few things I would have liked to have ordered on a night that it wasn't busy at all, but they made it worth it."}
{"text":"I have dined at Fuego numerous times with my sister and brother-in-law whenever they come to town. We always ask to be seated at \"Tiny\"'s section because of his great and friendly attitude. The food is excellent and very well priced. We ate there this past Friday night and were greeted by the Manager John who made sure that everything was to our liking. Fuego is well worth visiting if you have never eaten there. I will be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful! Worst prime rib I ever had! It was cold & tough to where the steak knife couldn't even cut it! The service was terrible. When I waived him down to tell him he asked me \"well, what do you want me to do? \" I asked him to replace it. By the time he came back my company was already done with her Steak! He told us he couldn't get her a 7 & 7 because that's at the bar outside. The worst $100 I spent! Then he had the nerve to say, you mean you don't want breakfast?\" I'm sorry no, everything was already terrible. We didn't want to add to it! I live near many steakhouses that have a much better & much cheaper prime rib. The $8 prime rib at Eldorado blows that away!"}
{"text":"I live close by and always drove to a competitors further away, don't know why I must have been dumb. This place is very well. The food were in very large portions and the taste was real good and the staff all work as a team helping each other. Very well taken care of."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff there and willing to ask any questions you have.  They were also nice enough to accept my Groupon for dinner on Father's day.  Very nice of them.  The rib eye steak has a very special Garlic and Cilantro sauce."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite places but it has changed a bit. Our waiter Tiny mixed up our steak. Ordered petit filet and he charged us for regular plus it ws supposied to be MR but was overcooked.  Ribeye was undercooked. Biggest items was neglect.  The food runner was more attentive than Tiny.   Other things like never checking back with us not refilling drinks or water.  And it wasn't busy. Just lazy i guess"}
{"text":"The GF and I decided to make another run on this after our last experience before checking out a movie.  MUCH BETTER!    We ordered off the Fuego Three Course Meals... -Your get your choice of a dinner salad, Caesar salad or soup of the day.    -You can pick from Prime Sirloin Steak, Prime Rib, Chicken or Salmon.  All are served with veggies.  -Lastly, you can pick Creme Brulee or Bread Pudding for dessert.  Three course for $24.    Our server, Mark and other staff were great!  I am glad I gave Fuego another shot."}
{"text":"FUEGO STEAKHOUSE IN HENDERSON..... Best restaurant in Henderson,     Fuego Steakhouse,  Chef William made our dinner reservation one to remember every one in our party was very surprised with the food, the service was exceptional!  But the food was outstanding....... steaks served to perfection! as we are all very \"VERY\" picky when it comes to our Steaks, each and every one was cooked to the perfect medium rare, the sides we exceptional also, salad, veg. and potatoes. When dessert was served we asked to talk with the Chef and as expected he was so personable! We will definitely be back........Thank you for your time Chef William.         P.S.   Everyone who goes out to eat a nice dinner expect's it to be perfection! Well in our opinions,  party of (4)  this Is as close as you can get at any 'Casino',  Remember,  your not at the Brown Derby in Hollywood. go and enjoy you will not regret..."}
{"text":"Yum! Loved this little place situated in Fiesta Station (only con). Once inside, it has a nice atmosphere and very attentive service. The rolls and bread are amazing. The salad (house) is okay, but I am not really a salad fan anyway. The filet was perfect and so delicious. Be aware that it comes with veggies and mashed potatoes, but they are garnish sized. My favorite item was the lobster tail...the best I've had in the area!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time tonight with family and relatives who were in town. I didn't know this placs existed until today. The atmosphere was very nice. The food and services were outstanding. Very good menu. The prices were reasonable. It's a nice little restaurant that's kind of hidden but that's nice for the locals especially where it is located. I would definitely recommend this placs to visitors."}
{"text":"We've come here for years and it's always great service. Pleasant, warm, a bit romantic, wouldn't recommend kids. This is our little secret restaurant with almost no wait and consistently good food. It is a bit pricey and out of the dozen or so times we've eaten here, we had one bad prime rib experience, they took good care of us anyway (We are not complainers, but it was pretty overdone) Anyway, nice litttle secret, and THE BREAD BASKET is to die for!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service ever been here twice in the last month both times we ended up walking out not being acknowledged the hostess was great the bus girl was great but when it came to the waiter coming to the table he just never came will never go back"}
{"text":"It's a decent place with nice but slow service. The food is good but it doesn't impress you with its quality or price. It's a place I'd go again but not one I'm waiting to go back to."}
{"text":"Only came here due to having a coupon.... service was TERRIBLE!!!!  so slow... the server even forgot to put in the tables order next to us so they waited about an hour... the food was good... but i dont think i would ever pay full price for there. i would go to sonoma celler at station over here any day!!!"}
{"text":"OMG Yum.  Can't wait to go back again.  Service was great, atmosphere was relaxed and comfy.  But the food...  First off, the basket of bread. Whoa. Three different types of deliciousness, all wonderful.  Could have stopped there.    But we got the shrimp cocktail.  This is a simple app, but to be honest, probably the best shrimp cocktail I've had.  Colossal shrimp and the sauce was just right.  I ordered the soup of the day which was a beefy mushroom kind of thing - it was wonderful.  Not too salty, not too rich, just right.  Wonderful with the bread - I had to find any excuse to eat more of that.  My husband had the salad which had very fresh ingredients and vegetables, more than just lettuce (yay).  I had the ribeye steak which appeared to be from a gigantasaur.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare and was oh-so-tender.  I ended up taking most of it home and it was as good the second time around.  My husband had the filet mignon and he finished his off and said it was delicious.  I wouldn't know, he usually shares with me, but not this time.  :(  The veggies with the dish were good, an assortment of broccoli and cherry tomatoes.  Very good, but we came here for the steak.  My husband ordered a 7 and Seven and he commented that it was mixed just the way he likes it (so I assume it was a bit on the strong side, but not overwhelming).    For this delicious meal including the appetizer and two drinks, it was only $80.  Not an everyday dinner for folks like us, but still very affordable for a steakhouse meal for two on occasion!"}
{"text":"This is a great steak house! Every cut of meat I've had here has been delicious and tender. The service is always good and the atmosphere is calm. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Worst dinner ever at this steakhouse it sure has changed sent our dinner back twice still came to our table cold will not return sorry"}
{"text":"My server Fiona was on point, quality product. Timing was right. Temp on my oscar was perfect. The only thing Calamari was little too oily but nothing to spoiled the experience. Over all good and yes the value above expectations. Cheers to Fiona and her assistant. Def... will be back."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Hidden in the Fiesta Henderson which isn't the most amazing casino in the world, this steak house is literally a hidden gem. My boyfriend and I shared the crab cakes, he had the filet and I had the chicken Marsala. The food was fabulous and the waitress was very attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Ate at Fuego for the first time, but definitely not the last! Everything was wonderful & our waiter, Marc, was the best! My husband had the prime rib, I had the stuffed shrimp & both were great!  We can't wait to try other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"It was a hot one today!  I parked relatively close by the front casino entrance where I followed a couple through the automatic handicapable doors.  About 10 feet outside from the door, I was met with a cool breeze of A/C combined with cigarette smoke.  This old bird needs some new air filters & a Febreeze/Lysol cleanse.  The restaurant is located in a private, dimly lit cave which I didn't mind, however cell phone reception isn't the best in there (AT&T).  The menu selection is limited.  Especially if you go for the 3 item deal...which I did not.  Dinner started with a vegetable \"beef \" soup.  There was no beef & hardly any vegetables.  It was more like beef broth that a few carrots & peas fell into by accident.  My scallops needed to be cooked a little more & lacked any char/crust which I like.  I didn't send them back because I didn't want them returning rubbery.  The steak was cooked well but had a ton of fat & gristle.  It also wasn't seasoned very nice, but it was edible.  Since there wasn't any garlic on it, I brought 1/3 of it (not the fat & gristle) home to my dog.  She enjoyed it without complaining.  Service was prompt & friendly as to be expected in a joint that had less than 10 tables occupied.  I'd give them 2 stars if it weren't for the hostess & waitstaff.  They bumped this place up a star.  I don't anticipate another trip back any time soon."}
{"text":"Ordered the filet minot and New York strip both medium rare, filet came out rare NY came out medium. We came in for a good steak and left disappointed. The plating was sad, a big white plate with a strip of mash potatoes and ONE SLICE of each a zucchini and squash. When it said seasonal veggies never imagined one single slice. Imagine a white rectangle plate with just a steak on the left and a line of mash potatoes on the right. A lot of empty space, for such a fancy place there's no fancy plating. There was too much wrong, didn't bother complaining, just won't return."}
{"text":"Quite good, good piece of meat Too much sauce in the ceasar salad for me Wine ok but a bit expensive Great service Atmosphere a bit ''too dark'' for me Good experience overall!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. It's quiet, the seating is comfortable, and the service is excellent. The only problem is most of the food items are served on a cart. So you find yourself with meat and vegetables and no starch unless you ask to add starts to your order. But, once again the service is fantastic. I have been there twice."}
{"text":"I came here for the second time on 1/22/14 and they were out of Rib Eye. Really?!?  A steak house that's out of steak?!?  Instead I ordered the NY Steak and it was just ok...wouldn't order it again though.  The rib eye was amazing last time. If I do come here again I'm calling ahead to make sure they have what I want but honestly shouldn't have to do that, but my boyfriend likes going there."}
{"text":"If there's one thing I know after spending the first 27 years of my life firmly ensconced in the 89015 zip code, it's Henderson's little secrets.  Of them all, Fuego is probably my favorite.  Nestled in a dark corner in the Fiesta Henderson (yeah, I know...), Fuego offers some downright delectable meals for people who like their meat.  Their weekday prime rib special (a 12 oz cut with soup or salad, bread, potato, and veggies) for $10 is an absolute winner.  It's an actual steakhouse, not a coffee shop, and the interior reflects it.  It's awfully nice to have some prime rib in a casino without fluorescent lights overhead or keno runners coming by.  The bread they offer up before the meal will change your life or at least expand your waistline.  I don't know how many sticks of butter go into each one of their flaky, melty rolls and I really don't care, and if you look away for a second I'll probably eat yours too.  (No worries, you can get more.)  If you find yourself in Hendertucky and you can brave your way through the Fiesta, please do.  This place really is a delightful little secret.  Oh, and get the house vinaigrette.  Thank me later."}
{"text":"This has got to the best best kept secret in Vegas. I am an out of town guest that ventured off the strip for the 1st time. I have to say that my experience in this steakhouse is better than any steakhouse in San Diego, almost better than the best."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Fuego and I have to say this restaurant is the best kept secret when it comes to steakhouses.  I had a medium prepared Ribeye with their house dressing cilantro garlic sauce, and it was truly amazing.  The picture I took looks a little off but that's because I cut into it as I always do to make sure the temperature is right.  Those people that follow me know that I am on a quest to try every steakhouse in Las Vegas and surrounding areas, Fuego will not disappoint you.  I want to give a shout out to Fiona who served us \"you are awesome\" and John the manager who checked on us, we had a good conversation and he came from my #1 choice for a steakhouse so he knows how to manage. I usually don't have too much bread before my meal buy my wife insisted that I try their croissant, it was warm, buttery and flaky, so so good, a must try. I loved my meal at Fuego and I am sure to come back."}
{"text":"Great little spot. Steak was great. Ambiance was nice and quaint. It's just a great little spot for a date or if you want to get away from the hustle of the casino."}
{"text":"Excellent steaks (and I know good steak), great service. Sensational breads. Very surprised its at Fiesta of all places. It reminds me of Terzetto at the M."}
{"text":"The portions were adequate. I ordered the prix fix menu of $28. This included a starter of soup or salad, an entree (I ordered a 10 ounce sirloin steak, there were three other options that all looked promising) and a dessert bread pudding or creme brulee (I tried both desserts, I would recommend the creme.) I also ordered a sweet potato for $4 more.   The food was good, but service was relatively slow. We agreed to a table and couldn't hear each other while dining. I would recommend a booth for your dining experience.  Overall, I can't say that I will be back any time soon. There are too many other steakhouses in the LV area to try, but I would not be against eating here again."}
{"text":"This steak house is a hidden gem, it's located inside the Fiesta Hotel Henderson! The food, staff & atmosphere is very nice & relaxing. The bread basket they bring out is filled with superb tasting breads the flakey one is divine! I've never been disappointed, the food always delicious; compliments to the chef & the staff is so kind too. I will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice restaurant for special occasions or dates.  I love the halibut and my hubby usually goes for steak.  Everything is great, including the waiter Mark.  This is one of our favorites.  The décor is tasteful and the lighting subdued.  Make reservations as it is fairly popular."}
{"text":"First Timers!! Not busy for Sunday which was nice quiet dinner. We had crab cakes appetizer - it was good needed more of their sauce. they lightly put it on the plate. We shared the 20 oz bone in rib eye and it was perfectly cooked to our liking at medium rare. Pan seared scallops was perfectly cooked and melts in your mouth like butter. Price was avg. $36 for steak and $28 for scallops and it comes with choice is soup or salad, potatoes and vegetables which were delicious. The ambience was nice and friendly staff. attentive but not bit bothersome!!! We will be back !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food.  Pan roast had tons of flavor.  Girlfriend ordered the petite filet and she loved it, no trimming waste.  Will try the surf and turf next time.  No complaints at all.  Calamari appetizer was very good and the basket of different breads was nice.  I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Don't come to this place. Got served rotten meat tonight. As an excuse, the manager said it was \"aged.\" Got an upset stomach and even worse a disgusting taste in my mouth. STAY AWAY"}
{"text":"Two weeks ago they changed the menu and this was our first visit.   iv been coming here one or two times a month on Wednesday with my aunt and grandmother who have been coming for years. Mostly because they love our server Mark (who is really wonderful). The food was pretty good too but not anymore. The only thing still consistent is the bread they serve when we sit down and the house salad, everything else seems to have changed.  The menu is now ala carte, unless you go with the special they have at the bottom- soup or salad, a choice between the steak, chicken, pork chop and orange roughy and a choice between creme brulee and bread pudding.  Right off the bat we where told to stay away from any of the steak-  so we did.   My aunt went ala carte with soup of the day (tomato basil) the king crab legs with a side of broccoli with hollandaise.  Grandmother went with the special with the house salad, chicken that she had saute with creme brulee.  I went with the the house salad, pork chop and creme brulee.  Our salad and my aunts soup came and all was well. We enjoyed it thinking that perhaps the new menu would not be so bad.  Then our meal came.  My aunts crab legs where a mix between warm and cold/frozen but her broccoli she said tasted great.   My pork chop was tiny with a bone, but it didn't matter because it was dried out with no seasoning or flavoring what so ever and hard a hard time finishing the first bite.  Grandmas chicken- great! Hot, moist and full of flavor, i got to taste. Wish i ordered it. The side that came for both our plates for the spacial was a mix of  yellow squash, carrot and something else. I didn't try them but my grandmother seemed to like them. I was just upset with my pork chop.    Part way through trying to cut my pork chop the manager came by asking if i needed another drink in which i declined but when i brought up my aunts cold crab legs and before i got to my pork chop, he walked away and was to never been seen again for the rest of the night.   How very nice.   Then dessert.  Both my grandmother and I asked for the creme brulee- then it came it was cold. Pulled right from the fridge, blasted with a torch and sent to us. Neither of us where happy. We asked for it warmed, they brought us another one that was even more chilled than the first one.  We where completely fed up. I feel so bad for Mark and the other servers. They where great but something is very, very wrong in the kitchen and management. We paid our bill but i doubt we will come back any time soon, only thing worth our money were the cocktails."}
{"text":"Excellent off-the-strip steak house. The filet was so tender and tasty. Doug was awesome serving us as were the support staff. Will def be coming back here. The prices were reasonable too."}
{"text":"The food was good a bit over priced in my opinion but the service was slooooow.  It took a long time to get our salads and we were concerned that they would show up with our food which would have pissed me off.  We told the manager when he came by to see how things were going, and all he had to say is that the there was a glitch in the kitchen but we saw people getting salads the entire time we waited.  It was like 15 minutes after we ordered before our salads came.    I ordered the prime rib which was advertised as a King cut but it was more like a regular cut, the flavor was kinda bland but it was cooked correctly.  I also ordered the mac n cheese which was good and can't complain since it was only $5.  We can get steak that is just as good or slightly better at other local casinos for less money."}
{"text":"-Waitress:  An annoying amount of up-selling.   -Bread Basket:  Best thing they have going.  Warm and includes pretzels. -Salads:  Boxed croutons don't belong at a nice steakhouse.  Either make them fresh or leave them out.  Wedge salad needed more bacon and less carrots. -Steaks:  We ordered filets medium rare; came out a solid medium, but still ok.   -Sides:  5 spears of asparagus is not \"family style.\"  Creamed spinach was plentiful, but SO salty.    -Veggies:  Meh, it's steamed broccoli and cauliflower.  I dipped mine in Bearnaise to make it edible.  Two weird cherry tomatoes also graced our dinner plate.  -Potatoes coming out of kitchen looked really good.  We wished we would have ordered one instead of the spinach.  Oh well.  Bus boy was the star of the show.  Our waitress was pretty absent from the meal and took forever to bring us our check.  -We won't be going back again.  Overall, I can better justify dropping 80 bucks at other places in town, not Fuego."}
{"text":"Went there for my birthday yesterday Dec. 23.  Usually go to another steakhouse, but Fuego used to be very good and thought we'd go there instead.  Ordered 2 steaks with potatoes, nothing fancy.  Waited for our meal 30 minutes and in the meantime many others entered the restaurant - it was almost empty when we got there. Finally our waiter, Tiny, came by and apologized for a \"backup\" in the kitchen and said it would be just a few more minutes. After more than an hour and watching others' meals go right by us, we walked out.  The manager apologized and had not explanation except problems with the \"back house\".  We left without eating and totally ruined my birthday.  NEVER go here."}
{"text":"Went for my birthday in June. The good things were the bread basket was delicious. Warm and soft bread. The waiter was great. Knowledgable , friendly. Very attentive service throughout the meal. Also nice touch with complimentary creme brulee for my birthday. But now the bad part. Very overpriced. Wife had scallops and I had the porterhouse. Came with mashed potatoes and veggies. Veggies were 3  half dollar size slices of squash and small portion of mashed potatoes. I know this isnt unexpected for highend restaurant but I was hoping I would be surprised."}
{"text":"This is our go to steakhouse. The combination of quality of food, service, value and atmosphere can not be beaten. We have never had less than perfectly prepared food and good service. Had the seafood combination platter on my last visit. Orange roughy, large shrimp, sea scallops and lightly fried calamari all cooked perfectly. The best value in Henderson."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for a good steak, and this seemed like a relatively reasonable option on a Friday night without having to head for the Strip. I was greeted promptly by the hostess, and quickly shown to my table. It was late, so I had my pick and chose a spacious window table (well, window on the casino).  A young woman came along quickly--assumed she was my waitress--to ask about a drink, but then the woman who turned out to be my waitress came along and almost seemed to cut her off. Slightly strange. Even stranger later when they both sat down at the table of these two gentlemen dining across the room. Maybe they knew them, but it was odd. In any case, I ordered a side salad with a tasty balsamic (a creamier one) dressing and occupied myself with a bread basket until the main course came. The pretzel rolls were tasty, though the other roll I had was just so-so, and the butter had a bit of a strange texture (maybe it needed time to come up to temp?).  But the steak was the thing, and I ordered a filet mignon with the addition of crab Oscar (crab, bearnaise and asparagus). The asparagus and other veggies were nicely done, the bearnaise was good (though I wish there had been more of it), and the crab was solid. The steak itself was ok, but was inconsistently cooked (parts of it were medium rare as I specified and parts seemed rather rare) and wasn't as tender as it could have been.  All in all, A-OK. Beyond the opening weirdness, service was fine and was certainly perfectly friendly (other than a little up-sell pressure), atmosphere was fine (though I was not a huge fan of the slight smoke waft from the casino) and the food was good enough. Certainly solid and not wildly expensive for what it is, but given the flawed execution of the steak, you wouldn't find me racing back here.  Too many other places to go."}
{"text":"This place has great food and is very reasonably priced. The scallops are served with 6 pcs and were very tasty. The halibut was pan-seared and was a very good piece of fish. They serve a croissant type bread and pretzel bread that was very good. The only negative was the dessert. We ordered the berry cobbler and it was not very good so be sure to order a different dessert. The carrot cake looked good. The service was very good. LI would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is a very good steakhouse.  The ambiance is warm and inviting.  They start you off with a bread basket with a variety of bread types, a nice added touch you don't get with most restaurants offering bread before the meal.  They bake their steaks and then grill them to completion.  I think the exterior of the stake has a little more char then my liking, so I have to ask them to go easy on that.  This in my mind is costing them the 5th star that I would have otherwise awarded.  I'll certainly be back here as it is a good meal and experience!"}
{"text":"This was the absolute worse steakhouse experience I've had in my life!! We ordered bacon wrapped shrimp, shrimp was under cooked. My wife ordered surf and turf, med rare filet, well....lobster overcooked and burnt... I had the king cut prime rib....no flavor and half of it was fat. Ordered oskar style... they put the wrong sauce on it and the crab tasted like the ocean. The only thing that was good was the croissant at the beginning. Didn't even have a manager come by when we sent back the surf and turf. Terrible. Don't recommend anyone eat there. I feel sorry for the server. The table next To us sent back their oysters too. Never going back."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had in a really long time. We started with meal with a glass of Pinto Grigio Santa Margarita and a delicious bread basket with popover crissonts we ordered bacon wrapped scallops topped with fried potatoes. The presentation was amazing and the appetizer was tender and melt in your mouth wonderful. My husband ordered the pan seared prime rib medium rare topped with a cilantro garlic sauce. This steak was amazing. You barely had to chew. You could cut this steak with a fork. The sauce did not over power the steak it definitely complimented the steak. I ordered the Canadian lobster. The lobster was sweet and succulent. We ordered a side of mushrooms. I would have to say the mushrooms we the highlight of the meal. They must have been cooked in clarified butter. I couldn't stopped eating them. I took my time to enjoy every bite of that meal.   The staff was attentive and nice. They time the food perfectly. The atmosphere was upscale but because it was in a casino the dress was casual. I don't give a lot of restaurants 5 stars, but for the fact that this meal was perfect."}
{"text":"We were looking forward to another outstanding meal at our favorite steakhouse but we were sadly disappointed in what we received. All three of us ordered the Mushroom soup to start dinner off but the soup was barely lukewarm. We pointed it out to our server and he offered to bring new ones out. Two of us ordered the king cut of Prime Rib and one ordered the seared scallops. One of the Prime Ribs was tough and my Medium Rare one was at least 50% rare. The main complaint was the scallops which were exceedingly sandy and inedible. The server brought the manager over who offered to replace them but didn't offer an alternate choice or to take it off the check. The replacement scallops had a very foul odor and will be thrown out. The only two positives of the visit were the outstanding croissant rolls and the very friendly hostess. It will be a long time before we return to Fuego after tonight's disappointment."}
{"text":"Group of 7 saturday night.  Host and hostest very personable.  Waiter Mark is consistent and patient, friendly.  Variety of food ordered from filet to salmon to chef special.  Meat was good but a bit smaller than previous visits?  Vegetables 4 slices of zucchini which was ok.  Chef special seafood dish the noodles were a bit over cooked and the seafood was average.  Drinks were a bit weak,  We have had better experiences here thus the 4 stars vs 3.  Very good potential here but missed the mark this time."}
{"text":"Four of us with differing tastes wanted a nice place to celebrate a anniversary. We decided on Fuego and everything was perfect and delicious. Food, service and ambiance was wonderful. Highly recommend this wonderful restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"We ate here yesterday and the food and service were excellent. I had the filet med rare with garlic mash potatoes and and a bottle of silver oak Napa valley. They were perfect. Looking forward to my return in the very near future. Nice job to your team."}
{"text":"I have been going to Fuego's since they opened. They may have a small menu but this is a steakhouse. I haven't had a bad steak from them.  Always cooked to my liking. Their sides are family style and always good. I had the pan seared halibut and it was great. Thankfully I shared with a friend who had steak so I was able to have my steak and eat it too. Friendly staff who remembers you if you return. Also very nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I had never been to the Fiesta except for the movie theater when my family wanted to meet at Fuego. There were five in our party altogether, and each of us ordered something different. I ordered the Prix Fix menu for $28: Caesar salad, top sirloin with a vegetable, and creme brulee. The Caesar salad was somewhat wilted but had a good dressing. The steak was deliciously charred and it came with French beans, where the other menu items did not come with sides and had to be ordered separately. The creme brulee was a very good one, freshly torched and deliciously candied.   The rest of the table all ordered steaks as well and added sides. They also ordered bacon-wrapped shrimp that they all enjoyed, but I'm neither a shrimp nor a bacon eater, so I abstained. I snuck a bite of the sweet potato, creamed spinach, and twice-baked potato, and all were delicious.   The service was great as well. My one complaint is the place settings and how they seated us...we were in a circular booth with two other tables in the restaurant and we felt pretty awkward sitting at this particular table. The place settings aren't really conducive to balancing cutlery on the on the plates. A strange critique, I know, but my knife kept falling off my plate!   This is a nice spot on this side of Henderson, but I don't know if I will be back because there are other places to try in town."}
{"text":"Have been eating here for years and we always ask for Marc as our server because he's the best and will always give you excellent service and an honest opinion about the menu. I'm a fan of their shrimp cocktail and my mate enjoys the crab cakes.  Chicken Marsala is his favorite entree while I mostly get the lobster which is very good. The popovers are buttery and delish with their house salad which I think is better than average. Veggies like asparagus and spinach are a nice add on. For dessert we always have the creme brûlée, my favorite."}
{"text":"Food and service were both excellent and the price was beyond reasonable.  Started off with scallops, enjoyed a filet with sides, and ended with the bread pudding.  Each and every bite was excellent.  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great meal. Filets were tender and cooked medium.  Service was good.  Would have been a 5 if service arrived sooner after we arrived.  The sides included with meal could be larger.  Will return though!"}
{"text":"First I should start by saying we go there for the croissants that are served in the bread basket before dinner. They are to die for! We are steak people. Their steaks are marginal at best, taste about like what you find at Smith's. Salads are not very good. Very smoky getting in and out of the place and a lot of elderly gamblers frequent the place.  I am amending my review as we have had Jessica as our server the last few times and what a difference! We have seen a lot of people with coupons that appear to have been mailed to them for gambling at the establishment. Favorite part.... amazing Croissants!"}
{"text":"We all know of a place to eat where we like the food or the service. This is a nice cozy place to take your wife and or friends and family. Starting with Sandra and finishing with John you can't go wrong with a visit to here."}
{"text":"This place is pretty bad imo.  The steaks weren't very good quality and the wine was served warm.  I can't stand when warm is served so warm at any nice restaurant, they should definitely know better."}
{"text":"First, you get the yummy pretzel bread and croissant . I  Had the filet mignon with the creamy horseradish dip and it was great! The service was good and friendly staff. Now time to run around the block."}
{"text":"Fuego closes at 10 pm. I was a little worried when my party of 4 rolled up at 9:55 to an almost empty restaurant, surely we were going to be turned away and get stuck having Denny's for dinner. Thankfully that was not the case, we were seated in a plush booth and were never rushed one bit throughout our meal.  The main reason we decided to dine at Fuego was  because my mother was in town to visit and she loves prime rib. Fuego had a special going on at the time for a $14.99 prime rib dinner that came complete with either soup or salad, a potato and another veggie. My mom also happened to be staying at Fiesta, and when she checked in she received a coupon for a complimentary appetizer at Fuego.   My mom decided on the shrimp cocktail for our appetizer, and while we waited for that the complimentary bread basket was brought out. WOW. The pretzel bread was to die for. The other breads looked great, not your typical dinner rolls but flaky looking muffins. I didn't sample these though, had to save room for the rest of the food!   The shrimp cocktail was only 4 shrimp but they were very large. Not sure I'd order this if I was paying for it but for a free appetizer it was just fine. After that, I had a bowl of the clam chowder while the other 3 members of my group had salads. I have had better chowder, then again I have had far worse as well.   Then it was on to the main course. My husband had the brick house chicken while the rest of us had the prime rib special. My husband's dish didn't look the most appealing, but it was cooked well without being overdone and dry. The prime rib was excellent for the price, a nice sized cut that was super tender and delicious.    Sadly none of us saved room for dessert, everything else was just too tasty! Service was top notch as well. Considering how worried I was we weren't even going to get seated, Fuego ended up being a much nicer dining experience then I had expected."}
{"text":"Wanted to have dinner and did not want Café Food. Talked my hubby into Steak dinner and I am glad I did.  Yummy!  They do have a 3 course special for $24 but I opted for my own individual picks.  Our server Thomas was a delight and very accommodating.  The lettuce that comes with the dinner salad I didn't like our server ask what was wrong & I told him I didn't like the lettuce.  He came back with a new salad made with romaine lettuce.  Not many places would do that usually you just miss out. I was impressed with the quality of the food, drinks and service.  I know it's little off the beaten path from the strip it is so worth it!  Don't get me started on how many yummy selections was in that bread basket! I had to refrain from eating more than a small piece of pretzel bread.  The best part is that I could come in Jeans, nice shirt and sandals.  A definite must on the places to eat when we come back in March for 5 days.  Worth taking the car out of valet and driving down the 215 to Henderson."}
{"text":"Went tonight.  Half price if you are over 50 and pay with points. In fact, several people made reservations weekly for the remainder of the month. I ordered the pan roast.  It was OK.  Shrimp overcooked, lobster under cooked.  Hubby had prime rib and brought half of it home.  We also had the house salad and french onion soup. Joshua was our waiter.  Service was excellent. Croissant type bread was full of butter but delicious.  By the time we left, place was full.  Even the head chef stopped by our table twice to check on things.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This was a great steakhouse to eat at. I will return many times over. The service was fantastic and my steak was perfect. The price was right also. I really felt at home here."}
{"text":"I so want to leave a high rating!  Having been a fan of Fuego for many years, my last visit 6:30P 4/19 stunned me.  I took my folks for dinner.  Took 2.25 hours, with a very long wait for everything. We thought it might be an issue in the kitchen (I could see three cooks playing with the piping bag for mashed potatoes forever) but it included the salads, drink orders, and entrées. Can't blame the oven for an hour wait for salad course!  Dad's steak was cooked the right temp but served cold and had to be sent back!  Mine was stringy but I ate it. I'm convinced they've changed suppliers. Worse yet, and the challenge so many businesses could remedy, was watching the the manager walk around the restaurant doing nothing. Our server apologized multiple times without our having said anything.  Thought the manager standing next to our table would have the chance to explain the issue. Oh well. No shortage of steakhouses in town!"}
{"text":"Wow I can't say enough good things about the steakhouse!! What an absolute Hidden Gem with an unusual and beautiful decor and two fireplaces!   The bread basket with the homemade croissant rolls was outstanding as well as the garlic Italian dressing for my salad.  My filet was cooked to perfection and I actually tried four out of the five sauces that you can order for the steaks at no additional charge which was a real treat considering most restaurants charge 3 to $5 for just a little container of a bearnaise sauce.  Tiny our waiter was awesome and very accommodating and this was one of the best meals I've ever had don't hesitate to go!"}
{"text":"This is a great resturuant. Are there better steakhouses in Vegas/Henderson?....sure there are...but when you factor in that Fuego is priced significantly less than those higher end steakhouses, Fuego is fantastic. Great tasting food, large portions, great service, nice ambience, and very reasonable prices...what more could you ask for."}
{"text":"My mother-in-law had a dining certificate here so we tried it last night. Fuego's is not what you'd expect walking through the Fiesta. The setting is very nice and laid back. We were seated at a comfy booth. It's nice to enjoy a low key steakhouse once in a while. Service was good and attentive. The bread basket was awesome (Diet? What diet? Lol) Our favorite was the croissant-like muffin that is the best bread I've had in a long time. Light flakey layers that are buttery good. There was also a pretzel bread that was fun to eat. Fuego's being a steakhouse, we ordered our favorite cut...filet mignon. First came the caesar salad which was ok and came on chilled plates but salad was a bit wilted. Our filets were tender but had temperature issues with being a level down from how we ordered it. So my well-done ended up being more of a medium well which was actually not too bad. It was served with some French green beans and our choice of complementary sauce. We tried the peppercorn...pretty good and the bernaise...not that good. Overall, a good value for good sized petite filet and green beans with a Caesar salad...$24. We would come to Fuego's for another meal."}
{"text":"Food was great but the service was subpar and it wasn't too busy.  This is a great locals spot without a long wait which is why we love it. The bread basket is by far the highlight!"}
{"text":"Great food. Love their steaks and portions are generous. The atmosphere is quiet and cozy, wonderful place for a date. Can't wait to enjoy this restaurant again."}
{"text":"This place was such a disappointment.  I only hope that this review will be helpful.  Otherwise, this restaurant is doomed.  Our reservation was for 5:30, we were there at 5:25 pm.  The hostess walked us to our table without engaging with us.  I asked her if  it was possible to have a different table, and she abruptly said, No, all the tables are reserved!  Her tone was so rude.  The waitress came over about 10 minutes later and could barely crack a smile. We did place an order and then began the wait. The busboy brought us water, and then some other guy brought us our food. An hour later the waitress came by to check on us again.  She actually walked by us twice but didn't even look over at our table. Finally another 20 minutes pass and she comes back, she never asked us if we wanted another drink, she never asked us if we wanted dessert .  I just told her to get us our check.  The only one that was hustling there was the busboy literally or I should say the bus man he was an older guy. We got up to leave and my father said he wanted to tell the manager, he went over to the manager to tell him about our experience and the manager was not receptive.  He just defended the waitress and said she had been there for 30 years?  Our bill was almost $250 for four people, spending this kind of money you would think you would get better service.  It truly was a shame that we had to experience this kind of service, because the food was pretty good . Unfortunately, we will not be back.  Honestly, the whole staff looked like they didn't want to be there.  No smiles, no engagement with the customers, no pleasantries.  Ooh she brought us our check and barely squeezed out a thank you!  There were also two tables right by us that were feeling the same way as us!!  We could of gone to Applebee's and got better service."}
{"text":"I frequent this steakhouse a lot, its my go to place for a fabulous Filet and a reasonable price.  The service is excellent and the food doesn't fall short either. I love the bacon wrapped shrimp for an appetizer, succulent large shrimp with cheese inside and wrapped with bacon and fried to crispy perfection.  Blue cheese wedge is my go to salad anywhere that offers it and there's is good but I've had them all so get what you prefer.  The bread basket has these yummy pretzel bread-sticks and my fav.. flaky..buttery-croissant like biscuits.  As I mentioned before the Filet Mignon is decadent and if you get the large one its at least 1.5 inches tall which makes for a delicious tender cut of meat.  I love having Jose or Tiny as my waiter,  they know their customers and take great care of them.  I've been to Sonoma Cellars a million times and this place is way better as far as Station Casino steak houses go.  The inside ambience is neat too, kinda like a dark safari theme, nice fireplace inside too."}
{"text":"We were in Henderson for the Best in the Desert Henderson 250 offroad race.  It was also my birthday, and the plan was to head to some upscale restaurant in Vegas.  But alas, after a long day at time trials and the long drive from San Diego the night before, we opted to dine at our own hotel, The Fiesta.  I admit to being a little skeptical about how the food quality and service would be at a hotel restaurant in Henderson but we were pleasantly surprised.  The appetizer of bacon-wrapped shrimp was decadent.  Our steaks (mine a petite filet, his a New York) were cooked to perfection; the twice-baked potato (which we shared) was very tasty, and the salads were creative (without even one piece of iceberg lettuce).  The complimentary chocolate cake for my birthday topped it off!  We each also had a glass of Kendall Jackson merlot, and our dinner was a mere $88 plus tip.  Friendly wait staff with competent service.  Could not have asked for more!"}
{"text":"This is relatively large steakhouse that never seems busy because of its circular layout.  We were brought menus and a bread basket that contained a couple of popovers plus some rolls that we ignored.  The one popover we shared was piping hot and delicious.  There were several servers, but we always seem to get the same one on each of visits.  He is the who wrote a book about his mother keeps talking to him from the grave.  My wife ordered the petite filet mignon while I ordered the halibut.  Hers was served medium rare as requested and mine on the well done side which I did not request. Portion size was good and entrees include a pretty good house salad, haricot verts and mashed potatoes.  The chef spends little to no time on plating as you can see from my photos.  I was able to parlay a Las Vegas Advisor 2 for 1 coupon with points so my only out-of-pocket expense was the gratuity."}
{"text":"This place is a solid three stars. To me that means I can take it or leave it, to be honest... often in these situations it comes down to the service. I didn't think it was great but it also wasn't horrible. The service was meh. The food was okay, but I feel like I can cook a better steak by going to Sam's Club and grilling it on my gas grill.   Do I need to go to Fuego again? Probably not.   Will I go to Fuego again, if I'm in the area? Maybe..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Some amazing steaks. Insanely in expensive. Super friendly staff. The atmosphere is a little old skool and tired. But who cares, the food is rockin' and some inexpensive."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants... always awesome food ( great cheat for me ... amazing bread) the ribeye is the best!!!! Wonderful service and always get seated fast. Manager always comes around greeting us and others and makes sure alls great. Could not ask for better service or food and it's at a great value!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a $25 of coupon to this place and we thought it was pretty good.  The bread basket they bring was very delicious as was the salad.  We both had the filet and it was cooked perfectly.  Rice pilaf is something I never get and won't again.  The service was nice but they didn't tell us about the specials and we overheard them tell the other table.  Also the decor is just like the casino so it was so much of a steak house experience.  A little over-priced for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dinner house in the Fiesta Henderson hotel. Good food and service. They have a chicken Rotisserie and the half chicken dinners R good. Crab cakes R excellent. Salads and fresh veggies are also A-1.  The Seafood combination platter was outstanding. No one got a steak 2nite, but we have eaten here on prior road trips and the steaks were really good."}
{"text":"First time there was looking for good steak good price less stuffy atmosphere. Restaurant delivered on all points. Service was not slow as reported by some others we were happy with the speed and service. Onto the food, shrimp cocktail was equal of anywhere in town. Fried calamari was just ok too chewy and served with porcini peppers?? Odd combination. Onto the mains NY strip excellent medium was spot on.  The colossal baked potato was just that too big to finish. The porterhouse was a bit thin (1/2\") but tasty and the mushroom medley was amazing. The chicken Marcela was very good not overly Marcela as in so common good flavor. All in all good food good value three of us got out for under 140 with tip so great value. The crescent rolls were amazing too and is a strong draw for us to return."}
{"text":"We ate at Fuego years ago and weren't super impressed.  So, when we read on Las Vegas Weekly's site about the revamped menu, we decided to try it for Valentine's Day.  We were not disappointed.  Prior to going, I confirmed they were not having a special V Day menu that you HAD to order off of.  We've not had good experiences with that in the past.  So, although they had a special, you also had run of the whole menu.  I'm glad we did.  To start, I had crabcakes and the wife had shrimp cocktail.  Hers was a solid version of this classic dish.  Great horseradish flavor on the sauce, and the large shrimp were not overcooked.  My cakes were very good, 2 for $9.  Not as large as others, but a very good value.  The sauce was a little too citrusy for me, so I didn't have a lot of it.  They are served with shoestring potatoes on top, which was a nice touch I hadn't seen before.  With your entree, you get a soup or salad.  Crazy in this day where everyone is a la carte all the time.  I had the caesar, which was fine.  The wife had the dinner salad, with a good blue cheese dressing.    For our meals, I had the garlic and cilantro marinated ribeye.  For $30, I don't know that you can find a better steak in town.  It was fantastic.  Better than some ribeyes I've paid twice  as much for at big time places on the strip.  Perfectly cooked, good char, and the flavors were fantastic.  I'm not a huge fan of cilantro, so I was skeptical, but it worked perfectly and didn't overpower the dish.  The wife had filet and lobster.  Good size lobster tail, moist and not dry (which can occur with overgrilling).  The filet was cooked to a textbook rare.  For sides, we had mac n cheese and creamed corn.  These are steals for only $3 each.  Both could have used more crisping time under the broiler.  The corn had peppers in it that enchanced the flavor.  Both were repeats.  The worst part of the meal was the bread pudding.  It was a miss for us, not hot enough and it felt like it wasn't heated all the way through.  The sauce was bland as well, the dish lacked a lot.  But, everything else was fantastic.  It's a definite repeat, and a great way to have a great steakhouse experience without the price tag you'll pay on the strip.  Service was excellent.  She was there exactly when we needed her, and did not bother us or try to upsell.  Corkage fee only $15, a very good price."}
{"text":"We went here last night to celebrate my birthday.  Really enjoyed the food, but was very disappointed to see the manager go to everyone's table to make comments, but never came over to ours even though it was my special day that we decided to dine at Fuego.  It was our very first time going there and will be our last.  It made me feel very unwanted. Even when we were leaving he passed us by at the door and still never said a word.   Our waiter, Tiny was very attentive although he overdoes it with calling his guest \"Young Lady and Young Man.\"  Once is good enough, Tiny! For Vegas, I've experienced much better service and food is good everywhere. Customer service should be top-notch by the entire staff especially the manager."}
{"text":"I agree with just about everyone else's reviews. This place is really a hidden gem! The prime rib special for 15 bucks was excellent! Not only was the meat a good quality (not just all fat like you get at some of the other restaurants in town), but the bread,salad,mashed potatoes,and green beans were incredible. We didn't have room for dessert! I can't wait to bring my entire family here. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with Dad again here last night and was delighted to get the trifecta of impeccable and gracious service along with great food. Always great!"}
{"text":"I had the filet mignon and my husband hand the Prime Rib, both were excellent! We will return I can't wait."}
{"text":"Best ambience & Best prices & Best Prime Rib! Service was on point too! Have Hanks quality at a better price at Fuego! Worth the drive if you aren't close..we had the Malbec wine which we loved too:) romantic spot, get booth by kitchen to see all the action if you are a foody like we are:)"}
{"text":"Wait, What?!!! This is the most unassuming steak house in Henderson and quite frankly all of Las Vegas.    It is sealed tucked away from the entire casino and shielded from all the smoke and sound and my oh my is it delicious, exquisite and food of quality beyond words. Oh and not to mention the amazing value!!!!   I will warn you, DO NOT  judge a book by its cover when coming into Fuego because you will feel like you walked into the Flintstones movie.  So once you move past the rocky enclaves and painted 70's inspired sunrise and tropical island orange and black murals and  you nestle into the cozy, charming and even at times romantic setting - you will forget your at the Fiesta Hotel & Casino.    Now let's talk about the food.  I will admit, between my fiancée and I, he is the steak expert and we have tried over a dozen steak houses in town from all price ranges and this one on value, quality and taste - hands down wins top price.  I had the Petite Filet Mignon (6oz) for $28 and my man ordered the huge Rib Eye for $36 and shared a side of scallops.  The bread basket is - a cheat meal all in itself stuffed in a napkin you will find a hot and  buttery croissant muffin and a pretzel baguette with whipped butter to melt your palette heart.   Once served your meal comes with side salad, soup of the day, mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies.   I ordered the salad with their creamy balsamic dressing instead of the soup of the day which was New England Clam Chowder.  The salad was fresh and crisp served with crisp greens and arugula and their dressing served to self drizzle was delicious.  I ordered my steak medium rare and two of their delicious sauces ( cilantro garlic and Bernaise), the garlic cilantro sauce was by far my favorite.  I have to talk about the mashed potatoes, for someone who is carb conscious this was the perfect portion, they were divinely buttery, fluffy and memorable, placed gently next to this bed of starchy clouds were two slices of squash and it was perfect.  They have an array of delicious side dishes but this was more than enough.  The scallops were out of this world, super clean and  cooked to perfection and served with drizzle of citrus lemon and a creamy buttery sauce that could not be any more perfect.  I also tasted my fiancée's rib eye and oh em gee! Wow. So juicy and drenched in that supercalifragalasticexpialadocious  signature cilantro garlic sauce.   We didn't order dessert because it was late and simply didn't fit but the creme brûlée, berry cobbler and cinnamon rice pudding were what I would have ordered.  Hope this review inspires you to give it a try to this hidden gem at the Fiesta."}
{"text":"After reading Yelp reviews, mostly touting happy fans; and hearing a fine review via word-of-mouth, we chose reservations for Wednesday at 5:30.  This is not a review about meat, however, so I can only imagine...  A maitre'd greeted us and immediately we were seated just where we wished to be-- at a booth in the heart of the\"action\" (not that you can find a bad seat in the house).  The ambiance is stunning, in bright Moroccan colors, a fireplace glowing, and all seating arrangements far enough apart for good conversation.  The music was at a perfect level and, frankly, it was quite a romantic setting.  Our server Fiona enjoys what she is doing and even kept my entree warm while I went to the restroom.  I ordered blackened salmon, accompanied by mashed potatoes & really delicious green beans, with a perfect lemon sauce on the side.  This salmon was surprisingly one of the best I've had for blackened (but chef w/make it several other ways too).  My partner chose Chicken Piccata accompanied by lemon pasta and green beans.  Since it's always a chicken favorite of mine, I had to agree this Piccata was wonderful!  And enough to take home.  A  number of my favorite wines of the red variety were on the list and I chose Layer Cake cabernet, velvet on my tongue.  How could I fail to mention the very warmed bread in a basket?  There were homemade Parker House-type rolls, a pretzel roll, and as Yelpers rave about--the croissants.  No kidding, they're better than the French bakeries in town.  Here is a toast to your experience at Fuego's Steakhouse at Fiesta/Henderson.  No doubt you, too, will be a very happy camper."}
{"text":"First time at Fuego lured in by the promise of crab legs. Was craving crab and remembered somewhere in my recent memory seeing something about a $19.99 crab special at the Station Casinos.  Was a Friday night so we thought it might be busy, but it wasnt and we were promptly seated in a booth. Sadly it took about 15 minutes for our server to acknowledge us and she was fairly abrupt and short throughout the meal. Strangely she was quite friendly and attentive to the table next to us. Maybe she was annoyed that we ordered the special? Not the highlight of the night.  On a happier note the crab, which we both ordered, was heavenly. Oh lawdy I have had some bad crab legs in this town. Frozen, tasteless, meatless. Not these. Two huge portions cooked to perfection and served with corn and potatoes. There was so much meat I barely got through one portion.  So, dont go for the atmosphere or non-stellar service, just do yourself a favor and go for the crab legs while they are cheap."}
{"text":"This is our first time eating here. What a pleasant surprise. The food was amazing and the service was outstanding. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a reservation at 7:00 PM on a Saturday night at Fuego. The restaurant is located between Cafe Fiesta and Amigo's. Be aware that you have to walk through a bar to get to the entrance, so more than likely, you'll get a nice aroma of cigarette smoke as you pass through. We were seated immediately when we arrived and our reservation wasn't necessary as the dimly lit restaurant was at about a quarter capacity.  We sat in a large booth and were served by Fiona and her team who provided sufficient service for the entirety of the meal. Don kept our waters refilled and kept the table orderly with timely prebussing. I was interested in any specials that were being served that night, but Fiona mentioned in passing that the lobster tail was the special. She mentioned it so briefly and without description that I lost any interest in ordering. While we were browsing the menu, a basket of tasty popovers and pretzel bread was delivered.  For appetizer, we started with a dozen large blue point oysters. They were just ok, they looked like they weren't freshly shucked and had a strange odor to me. For entrees, my wife ordered the rotisserie half chicken which she enjoyed and the serving was large enough for take home and for leftovers the following day. I ordered the filet medium rare with caramelized onions and mushrooms as my side. There are five choices for sauces that you can select to accompany with your steak. I did not choose one but I probably should have since my filet came out probably two minutes over. This cut of meat lacked any marbling which equates to a dry steak with the slightest overcook. The steak should have been the star, but was the most disappointing.  Fuego is OK and would be one of our choices if our primary options were not available and we were looking for a place that was not crowded and without excessive noise."}
{"text":"This place is tucked away at the Fiesta station casino in Henderson and is not bad at all.  Great combo meals, amazing bread basket, and great service.  Sometimes I feel these smaller station casino restaurants have better attention to detail than the fancy strip places simply because they know if they can get a good impression going.... They come back!   More strip places need to take a lead from them.   My salad was dressed perfectly, my steak was cooked right the first time, my dessert was decadent, and my service was not overbearing but courteous and knowledgable."}
{"text":"We had a best dinner. Stake , Crab cake are the best. On top of that, Quinn is a best manager with his outstanding  service. We definitely come back."}
{"text":"I was not going to let one time with bad service make me not go back.  We celebrated our 8th anniversary here a few weeks ago and were very pleased with everything.  We ordered shrimp for an appetizer and it was delicious.  I have been dieting and saving up for this meal and what always kills me (in a good way) is the bread basket.  I LOVE the pretzil bread - I did have this but wanted to save up for my dinner.  I ordered the salmon which I had grilled with grilled asparagus with a sweet potatoe.  My husband ordered steak and lobster with a baked potato with the works.  Everything was perfect. The waiter and staff was very attentive to us during the meal.  We never once had to chase someone down to fill up our drinks.  The waiter gave me some pretzils to go.  I will probably request to sit in his area if he is working when we go next time."}
{"text":"FUEGO STEAKHOUSE (at the Fiesta in Henderson):  Midweek, party of 3 - we ordered:  Filet Mignon (2 orders at $32 each) and King Cut Prime Rib ($28), all served with seasonal vegetables (broccoli and carrots) and we each added a small house salad ($3 each).  The filets were absolutely delicious, extremely tender and flavorful and cooked to perfection - the best filets I've had in a restaurant in years. We ended up taking half of our filets home and they reheated beautifully the next day - every bit as delicious and tender as they were the night before.   The King Cut Prime Rib was immense, cooked to absolute perfection, extremely tender and flavorful and was perfectly trimmed with just the right amount of fat to make it rich and succulent. Amazingly, this steak did not make it home - it was devoured completely, only a small tablespoon-size of fat scrap remained on the plate with a tiny smearing of creamed horseradish lingering as evidence that a prime rib steak once rested on the now empty plate.  The house salads were served cold, crisp and tossed in just the right amount of dressing, the seasoning and consistency of which were perfectly balanced - delicious.  The restaurant is relatively small compared to some on the Strip and the overall atmosphere is dark, cozy and very comfortable. It is located to the side of the casino floor, nestled discreetly behind heavy glass partitions that completely block out all the smells and sounds of the casino so they don't compete in anyway with the enjoyment of your meal.   REASON for 4 STARS, NOT 5:  My only complaint concerns the seasonal vegetables. So often, restaurants seem to use vegetables as more of a garnish rather than a complete side dish, and in this case, that was the result.  Although the carrots - of which there were only 2-3 small slices - were somewhat cooked, the broccoli was nearly raw, consisted of mainly hard stalks and lacked any real seasoning.    Overall, the service was attentive and friendly. I would make two suggestions to management:  1) encourage the staff to refrain from congregating as a group in front of the kitchen engaging in personal chatter and laughter while waiting for their orders. For the tables located near this area it was distracting and didn't appear too professional; 2) instruct staff to ask patrons if they are finished with their dishes before reaching across the table and removing plates guest are still enjoying.  We definitely recommend Fuego Steakhouse for a delicious steak meal. We intend to return again soon to indulge in the lobster tails of which we witnessed a dozen or more pass by our table and that looked absolutely fantastic ($90)."}

{"text":"Before Fuego I did not have a Yelp account but after eating there I do now.  I learned the restaurant had a weeknight special of buy one entree get one half off, so we decided to try it.  I knew Station Casino owns Fiesta Henderson so I thought it could not be too bad.    We had reservations for 7:30, which were not needed as four couples were in the restaurant when we arrived.  We were quickly seated and drinks were served fast.  We shared crab cakes for an appetizer and I ordered a med rib-eye my girlfriend a med petite filet and we shared mashed potatoes and mushrooms.      As were were waiting for the appetizer the staff was not too busy because they were hanging where the food comes out laughing and joking.  You could hear the F word as they joked with each other.  This should have been are sign to leave.    The app arrived and the crab cakes came on a plate with thin french fries on top of them, strange.  The top of the crab cake was golden brown however the bottom was blacken.  They tasted fine but I have had better out of the freezer case from Costco.  By this time a busser came to clear our plates and refill our water.  As he cleared the table to get ready for diner, he split my water glass over the table and on my leg.  At this point I was really wondering what I was doing at Fuego.    Our steaks and sides came and the presentation was good.  My girlfriend cut into her streak and it was completely over cooked.  The steak had very little pink and dried out.  My steak was a little over cooked however it was not seasoned and I had to salt it.  I asked if she wanted to say something as we decided to just eat our meal.  The mushrooms were actually pretty good, however the mash potatoes were not.  They were dried out and tasted like they were made two days ago.    We ate what we could and finished our meal.  Neither of us are the type to complain so we decided to just pay and leave.  So we waited for our table to be cleared as we watched as a black male and black female employee stand with their backs to the dining area and flirt with one another.  Finally our table was cleared and our waiter came with our check.  I looked it over and discovered the discount (reason why we even came) was not taken off of the check.  The manager who, for the first time all night was walking around, came to our table and asked if he could take our credit card and cash us out.  I asked him about the discount and he said he would take care of it.  The corrected bill arrived and he asked how everything was.  I told him about the mash potatoes but I knew if I told him the entire expirence I would embarrass my girlfriend.  So we paid for the meal, $90.00 and left.    To say we were disappointed was an understatement, we laughed about the expirence as we should have known since it was at the Fiesta Henderson.  However our laughing stopped as we got home and my girlfriend became ill with a bad stomach.    If you are looking for a Steakhouse expirence I would avoid Fuego.  The prices are steakhouse but the flavor and professional service is Denny's, which is next door.    Oh....the bread was good."}
{"text":"Well where do I begin. This was special evening out for my dad's birthday. first the butter rolls are to die for, but they horribly BURNT and they had the nerve to serve it. Attendant ask the Chef to make a new batch , but had to wait till they served it all. Vegetable the came with your meal was mushy and nasty, almost stink. The petite steak I order was okay, not excellent as it has in the past. This is our last visit to this place. Not paying good money for carp, when I can get better for cheaper elsewhere.  Sorry. you'll be disappointed if you dare come."}
{"text":"I CANNOT say enough good things! You would have no idea such an amazing steakhouse is located in such an old casino! DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Gut fud. Eet heer. Know roaches. Kids like. You enjooy gud heer. Cheep two. Eat cheep anf fud gut."}
{"text":"Wow! We enjoyed every minute of our visit here. Great coctails, great food, and awesome service. Thank you Jose for helping our family have an unforgettable experience. The Mai Tai coctails were delicious, Prime rib was cooked to perfection, filets could not have been more tender and juicy with a perfect flavorful crust, and the cheesecake was like silk. A+ guys. We will return. I also love that when inside your restaurant there is no evidence of being in a casino. Very private and secluded location. Thank you."}
{"text":"The best New York steaks in the Vegas area! Service by all involved is phenomenal ! Great atmosphere! You can't ask for more."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for the steakhouse because we have always enjoyed the Fiesta buffet and the Grand Cafe in the same hotel.    Good things: We were seated immediately (although maybe that is a bad thing?  not enough customers?).  The Mexican decor is very nice.   The bread basket was very good, as another reviewer mentioned.  We had a coupon that came in the mail, that we were able to use.  Bad things: I ordered the petite filet mignon.  I usually order this at all steakhouses.  I was extremely surprised when the waiter brought my dinner.  It was like a child size.  Maybe 3 oz?  Likewise, the mashed potatoes was the size of a small dollop, and tasted like it was made from a mix.  You'd think they would try to fill up the plate with mashed potatoes which probably costs pennies to make.  Don't they teach you in 'intro to hospitality' that the best way to make portions look bigger is to put them on a smaller plate?  Glad I had a coupon because otherwise I would have been WAY more disappointed!"}
