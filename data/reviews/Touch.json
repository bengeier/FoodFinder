{"text":"There aren't too many Indian spots in the Path so I was glad I found this. Their curry combos comes with curry + side veggie + choice of rice or naan (which is pretty big and fluffy!). I've tried a few curries and overall, they taste pretty good but the flavours are fairly mild as well. I've asked for their spiciest curry, which is the lamb curry, and there was barely any heat to it. Their chicken biryani is not bad - it's cooked with big pieces of chicken and you have a choice of sauce poured on top. Good place to go if you have a big craving for Indian food but it's pretty expensive for what it is."}
{"text":"The menu is very confusing. Rice is consider as a main item.  The food was okay but there is no consistency with items on the menu.  I had an eggplant masala once and never seen it on the menu again.  I asked about it  and the owner said that eggplant was too expensive to buy from the supermarket so they stopped making it.    Naan bread was pretty good but expensive individually. Chicken curry was a bit too greasy."}
{"text":"Skip the Kathi roll! I've had their thali items and they're all good, but I wanted to try something handheld. I noticed they've added a shwarma thing too. The Kathi roll was made with shwarma chicken, lettuce and wrapped in roti. But the chicken was very salty, there was way too much sauce, the roti fell apart and it was just a mess. I couldn't get through a quarter of it before I took that picture and tossed it. It was $8, I could have paid a dollar more and stuck with the reliable meat thali. With an experience like that,  I'd stay away from the shwarma as well.   If they're listening, make it with tandoori chicken, add potato, and use some raita or chutney instead of all that mayo."}
{"text":"I've only eaten the Chicken Biryani & Shwarma here. Biryani - Flavorful. Tasty. Chicken in Biryani - not so much. Butter chicken (on the Biryani) tastes a bit too sweet for my liking.  Shwarma - More meat than I expected. Wish they didn't use whatever paper they used because it sticks to the bread and is annoying to remove. Really tasty though.  Good for the price though, try it out."}
{"text":"Butter chicken is a little too sweet and I'm currently upset they gave me COLD naan (typically when made to order, as it should be, it's delicious here). It's literally so cold I would have believed it if I was told it came from a fridge. Disappointed.   This will be my last visit here unfortunately."}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good fast food for Indian cuisine these day. There used to be one inside Brookfield foodcourt that we can easily access, then it was closed down. This one is hidden near Staples. Monday-Wednesday, they serve curry fish. The fish is okay, sometimes I find it a little soggy. But the curry and spicy level is very good. The rice goes well with it. But the Papadum is very good here  50 cents for one, sometimes I get half a dozen and bring it home to eat. The spicy level is good and crunchy. I bought a few and shared some with my friends, they enjoyed it too! I usually come here once a week, when I crave for fast Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is kind of hidden. Located underground in the PATH, between Dynamic Funds Tower and Scotia Plaza. It definitely isn't a three $$$. More like $. They have daily specials under $8.  Taste wise, it's definitely not close to the best Indian food I tried in Toronto (excluding my time in India!), but it isn't bad either. Curries for both chicken and chickpeas are not spicy enough. Naans were lukewarm. Portion is OK. Would come back when wanting to stay close by and craving a quick butter chicken or curry, but not my first choice.  The \"restaurant\" is a small area. They have a couple tables to sit and eat, but are always taken so the people in line are mostly taking it to-go. You can also eat it at the food court close by."}
{"text":"I met a friend in the PATH for lunch at Touch and was so disappointed, as this was my first time here.  My friend got butter chicken (it was orange and sooooooo sweet - gross) and I ordered Chicken Tikka only - no rice, and no veggies.  I was charged $10.16 for a small container of chicken ONLY - nothing else (no sides, no bread, no drink).   I paid for my pathetic portion of chicken and went to grab one of the dipping sauces on the counter and was YELLED at that I had to pay $0.50 for it!  Are you kidding me?  I will NEVER, EVER return here and will advise everyone to stay away!"}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Indian food, be sure to order a garlic naan they are fantastic. Mango lahsi to wash it down. Then head for somewhere quiet to take a nap after all that food."}
{"text":"I was walking across Adelaide and caught the distinct aroma of Indian food coming from a random vent on the street so I took my friend on an adventure with me to locate from whence it came.   We walked into an outdoor seating patio-like area in the middle of some buildings and we went inside one and once we found our way into the PATH we stumbled upon Touch.   They have two lines there - one for shawarma and one for Indian food.  My friend had the shawarma and I grabbed the meat thali (which included some rice and three meats), of which the flavours were amazing.  Plus, the naan I ordered was a MONSTER (didn't finish it)..   We were both pretty full afterwards and now that I know how to get there I'll totally be back.."}
{"text":"Work in the area, so come here at least once-a-week for lunch. Their chicken biryani is awesome and its the real deal. The butter chicken, chicken curry and the kebabs are also pretty good.  Definitely a fan!!"}
{"text":"The veggie food was bad... like bad bad. I had Paneer mutter (paneer only on Thu Fri) & Kadhi pakoda. Paneer had stale dark pieces mixed with fresh. Kadhi pakora was tasteless... less salt, as if they ran out and added more water/ gravy to existing. The only thing I like is their fresh hot Naan. Don't take what they give u, ask for fresh from the oven.  Skip it. The fact that I am writing a review interrupting my meal proves the point."}
{"text":"Tucked away on the edge of the PATH, this pace has authentic, spicy and delicious Indian food. Very good value for money too. Two orders of Chicken Biryani were within $13, taxes in! Only thing is, its well known to some, and dishes such as the biryani run out very soon.  If you're looking for the North Americanized version of Indian food (read sweet butter chicken) then this is not the place. But for the real thing, head here!"}
{"text":"Not great. I read the reviews on here before I went for here lunch today and one comment I have to highly agree with is that their butter chicken is a disgrace to indian food! It's very watery, there is no depth or flavor and to top it off, they put more sauce than they do rice... it was very sweet and tasted like the chicken was almost burnt sitting there for days.   The store itself is dirty, the tables to eat on were not clean and were disgusting. The chairs were even covered in little bits of rice.   Bad vibes."}
{"text":"Portions are small compared to the prices. After a few house of eating my meal, I became extremely sick and this lasted 3 days.   Never again."}
