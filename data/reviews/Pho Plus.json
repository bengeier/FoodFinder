{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. My friends swapped our lunch location last minute from another restaurant to this one. I was a little wary because I'm no expert in Vietnamese food. We were warmly greeted and  quickly seated, always a plus! I had the pork vermicelli, spring rolls and chicken pho. 

The portions are quite large compared to most places uptown, so price/quantity ratio it is a good deal. Not really having a baseline for Vietnamese food, I enjoyed it. It was healthy and filled me up. The Pho was definitely more flavorful than the vermicelli but both were satisfying. For sure a good lunch option!"}
{"text":"Going in to the restaurant is fantastic. Great food and service. Last time I was there I saw that there was an advertisement at the register that they partner with grubhub. I had a lunch break for work and ordered it. Worst decision I made. The restaurant seems to have a poor system in this matter because I had to wait my entire lunch without food and paid for it. I never received my meal. If you can't consistently deliver a quality experience with a delivery partner you should not advertise it."}
{"text":"i did not like the service at all! server never came to the table to checked up or ask if everything was ok. had to flag him at least 4x!! did not get the veggie plate that came with the  pho, had to ask about another order i put in, the to go box was too small and he went back to get a bigger size but it was still too small, had to call for more napkins, iced coffee came a lil later.... waiter was constantly rushing and passed the table many times .  later the manager came by and ask if everything was good today . i said no. it is hard to get some service here!!! and he did nothing about that. he checked me out and i used my groupon and found out later that i can only redeem $10 at a time, and i am not planning to come back to reedem the next coupon. not worth it! the food was OK,just a lil bit sweeter . ive had better viet food in charlotte that is worth your money n better service , even during rush hour."}
{"text":"Vietnamese food is my number one choice and I am a bit picky with my restaurants. I will say that this is BY FAR the best pho I have EVER had. I have eaten just about everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed me. Not only is the food good, but the staff is incredible. 

If you have not been here yet... hurry up and try it. You will not regret it!!! There is something on the menu for everyone"}
{"text":"Excellent Pho and the ambiance was perfect! As a pho lover and Charlotte regular, I was bowled over by their version! Many restaurants use star anise and it is too floral, not so here! Robust flavor and excellent value! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I eat lunch here on the regular. With my current obsession for pho, Pho Plus hits the spot. Service is quick and the soup is always still steaming hot when I get back to my office. I often have to let it sit and cool. Make sure to taste the broth before you put in all the extra goodies and only add things a bit at a time so you find out what you really enjoy. There is a ton of chicken and noodles in the small size. 

I'd like to eat in and get the real feel. Everyone looks like they are enjoying themselves. Never too busy and the line moves quickly."}
{"text":"we stopped by for the July 4th fireworks and decided to walk in the street for some food. We are glad that we ended up in this store! The store owner was really generous and the food is wonderful! The price is very affordable for this area as well!"}
{"text":"Great banh mi by great people!!! Much better and affordable than the overrated Le's sandwiches next door. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Some of the freshest bahn mi in the city and the pho is also delicious with reasonable prices. The staff is super friendly with a rustic decor. I suggest this if your a big fan of bahn mi and in the uptown area."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken pho but it came with the regular beef broth. What the pho?!"}
{"text":"Location is nice. But parking can be an issue since it is downtown. The prices arn't bad at all. $8.95 for a Large bowl of pho. $4.50 for a banh mi.

The banh mi is really good. They put a lot of Pork in my Banh mi. A lot more than Le's Sandwiches (well known for there banh mi). 

Pho was just \"ok\". The broth was not tasty but the sriracha and hoisin sauce fixed it for me. I ordered a large bowl and had a hard time finding any beef. And the meatballs were cut into fourths! I have never been to a pho restaurant in my life where meatballs were cut into fourths. It is either half's or a whole meatball. If anything i got a big bowl of noodles.

Banh mi, chill vibe, and good service won me over. I'm willing to give the pho a another try."}
{"text":"While on a business trip to Charlotte during one of the coldest days in North Carolina history, I had a craving for warm soup and found this restaurant nearby my hotel.  It's a casual place where you order at the counter and can choose to sit down or do takeout.  I had the shrimp/chicken summer rolls with peanut dipping sauce and the Pho Ga (chicken pho).  

The summer roll was solid and came with a good amount of chicken and shrimp inside.  The cellophane wrapper was the perfect crispness without being overly soggy.  

The chicken pho (small portion) was very large and came with plenty of noodles, chicken, and onions.  The broth was flavorful, though I'm fairly certain that it had a healthy amount of MSG in it because after the meal I had a severe food coma and had to lie down for a nap.  On the whole, the meal was very satisfying and just perfect for a cold winter day.  

The service was pleasant and extremely attentive - my water was constantly refilled and I was asked multiple times if I needed anything.  

If you find yourself with a craving for Vietnamese food give this place a try!  One other thing:  apparently they outsource a delivery service so you don't need to pick-up or dine-in."}
{"text":"Yuk.. Busy place crappy food, atmosphere loud noisy.. 
Soup tasteless, boil water throw veggies, precooked noodles, scoop of chicken, beef ..  Yuk
No spice, no flavor.. 
No value"}
{"text":"I have gotten boba here several times and the last two times have sucked. Before the most recent visit they gave me a ROTTEN avocado boba smoothie. I took one sip and went back and told them it tasted rotten. The guy at the register admitted that they thought it had tasted wrong. Keep in mind that I never had given them a taste of mine so it gives me an impression they knowingly sold me a bad drink. The most recent time they made me a Thai tea milk tea and it tasted ultra flowery + perfumey and I found leaves in it! Clean out your blenders. I did not have time to return this one because I was at work. Not worth $5 either time."}
{"text":"The restaurant is great , the noodle soup is definitely one of the best in Toronto IF not the best.  Servers are nice in all.  A great restaurant overall , will for sure come back !"}
{"text":"Loved it here first time I've had Pho definitely encouraging foodies and anyone who wants something different.  Will be going everyweek I can"}
{"text":"So to start with I think this review should be 4.5 stars but I can't select that so going with 4 stars. 

Now that we have that out of the way let's talk food. I was hungry so I decided to splurge or pig out - whatever you prefer. I got a \"small\" pho with chicken and the pork sandwich. First of all I got it to go and I wouldn't say that was a mistake just makes it a little harder to eat the pho. They did a great job however of packaging everything so that I could eat at my desk.

First off the sandwich was huge and only like $4.50. They could sell them for $6.95 easily. The bread was perhaps the best I've had in Charlotte - think Amalie's style baguette - but better. Yes I'm serious. I mean this was like small village restaurant in France good. Now the pork - wow. Thin sliced ham - again similar to what you might get in France. And then it has other interesting ingredients packed in like thin sliced jalapeños. Super tasty and what a deal. 

So now I have this huge container of soup to deal with. Not a problem. Noodles were perfect and chicken was tasty. Added a little sriracha sauce and it was perfect. One other review said the broth seemed slightly sweet and I detected that as well but it wasn't overwhelming and I thought it added to the flavor. 

So if you are looking for something a little different for lunch give them a shot. They also have a decent dining area so feel fee to eat in as well."}
{"text":"Have been a regular in last month or so. Great Phos cooked with broth! Finished the whole bowl of soup every time satisfied."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a \"Bubble Tea\" on my lunch break. Got more than I bargained for - there was a BUG in my drink! Yuck! Needless to say, I won't be back."}
{"text":"Though the place just opened on 7-14-14 I had a horrible experience here. Waited 45 minutes for my food. Received no napkins, silverware or refills on drinks. The waitress only came to our table on three occasions. When I went to appeal my case, I was still asked to pay for my meal. 

We had to walk over to the waiters area to obtain our own chopsticks, napkins and straws. One of the worst places I've been to in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"Didn't eat in so can't speak to that experience, but the takeout pho was solid. Good but not amazing IMO. Came to $9-10. I also noticed that they had an 86.5 sanitation score, which is pretty gross level low. On other hand, the restaurant seemed clean enough. Okay place."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME!   I work across the street, and I love coming here.  The Pho is very very good, and the service is just as nice.  They are very fast, friendly, and reasonably priced.  For $7 you can get a \"small\" bowl of pho... and when I say small, I mean you can barely finish it becuase it is SO big!  I would recommend this to anyone who loves pho or anyone who has never had pho.  You will LOVE it."}
{"text":"Great place for a casual, fast, and cheap dinner.  Excellent pho in Charlotte.  I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much, since I grew up with tons of Vietnamese people and grew up in an area where good, authentic Vietnamese food was abundant.  So, after eating at Pho Plus, I can confidently say that they serve up some fairly authentic tasting pho with a decent broth that is comparable to Vietnamese food in the Atlanta suburbs (Buford Hwy, anyone?).   

I would skip the appetizers.  The spring rolls (cha gio) were mediocre and the summer rolls (goi cuon) were less than mediocre.  Very skinny rolls with little filling and the outer rice sheet was too firm.  I have not had the banh mi here, so I can't comment on that.

As for the pho, I got the rare steak with tripe, as I always get at every single pho restaurant.  I loved that Pho Plus offers up a very delicious and very spicy hot chili oil that goes really well with the soup, if you're looking for some heat.  A little goes a really long way as it was pretty damn spicy for all of us and we eat a lot of spicy food, but it's a good addition to the broth and I don't usually put anything but lime in my broth.  The noodles were cooked nicely and were not soggy, as some bad pho places might have.  The broth was hot, beefy, and spiced the way it should be with the proper Vietnamese herbs.

Proper way to eat pho - add bean sprouts, Thai (Asian) basil, jalapenos (just to make the broth spicier), and a squeeze of lime.  Some people like to throw in Sriracha and hoisin sauce into the broth, but I prefer mixing the two on the side and dipping my meat in it.

I'll be back when I'm craving Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Good food for a very reasonable price. Close to the baseball stadium and not nearly as crowded as the other restaurants."}
{"text":"I was in town for a convention, after three days of sandwiches, I set out to get something different and found this little gem through Yelp. The pho is authentic, portion smaller than what you get in California, if you used to get regular size bowl, you may have to ask for large size, and if you start with large at home, you may need to add extra noodle. If you go to Colorado, it is a different thing, their medium is large in California. Less exotic ingredients that were standard in Little Saigon, here is simple beef slice and beef balls. The bean sprouts and herbs are washed very clean, extra point. Soup base is tasty and well done, slightly salty. Egg roll is up to par, Vietnamese coffee is made from the condensed version you can get at Costco, which is okay consider the location. Very clean restaurant and nice service."}
{"text":"I will start with the not-so-great news first; they have a \"B\" sanitation grade (86). I didn't notice until I went to pay but the meal I had was delicious. Since there are various infractions that impact sanitation score I decided to research what Pho Plus' were before completing this review. There were 6 critical violations that have seen some improvement since the 12/28/16 inspection. Based on an issue with the ice maker, my suggestion for your visit would be to order a canned or bottled drink. 

Now for the good news. The service was quick during the lunchtime rush. The food came out quickly. We ordered spring rolls, chicken pho, and seafood pho. The spring rolls were crispy and not at all greasy. There was lots of sprouts, basil, and jalapenos provided on the side to adjust your dish as needed. The warm, flavorful broth was exactly what we needed on such a cold day. My first visit was a to-go order and the quality matched my sit-down experience today. 

I would return and potentially try some other menu items but hopefully after a successful updated inspection. The sanitation grade is the reason I gave 3 stars as opposed to 4."}
{"text":"Fast, good Pho. Seafood Pho is great but fish balls are a little funky in it. Fresh shrimp rolls are good but small."}
{"text":"I had the veggie pho and it lacked good pho flavor. Not the best I've had and nothing appealing that made me want to come back for more. There also weren't many veggies compared to other Vietnamese restaurants"}
{"text":"4.7 / 5.0 stars 

Came here to grab bubble tea while I was visiting Charlotte. 

I ordered a mango bubble tea. It took longer than expected for them to make this drink. It's weird because I came here right after the lunch rush so there was nobody there at the time. I thought it was going to be quick. But it took around 15 minutes to make it.

But when I finally got it, I slurped it down so fast. I was craving some bubble tea as it was super hot outside and I was sweaty from walking around outside. It tasted really good. A lot of the bubbles however, were clumped together so it was sometimes difficult to drink as the bubbles would usually get stuck in the straw. 

The workers were very nice and respected my order."}
{"text":"Prices went up today. Somewhere in the neighborhood of  10%-20% per dish. The food has been consistently fast served, great tasting, filling and reasonably priced. Now the question is, \"is that exact same serving of food worth the additional expense?\"  Will have to mull that one over. In the meantime there are other places within walking distance that give good food with good prices. Loss of star for price restructuring"}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! My fiancé and I have gone several times and each time, the food has been fresh, flavorful, and delicious. The venue is very clean and it's located in the heart of Charlotte, just outside of Romare Bearden Park. The man who runs the place shows a clear passion for what he does and all of the staff are friendly and generous. Definitely recommend it as the best restaurant to get pho anywhere in Charlotte, and it's the perfect spot for a date!"}
{"text":"My co-worker is Vietnamese and when this place opened she was extremely excited for me to try it. So I did and loved it even though she ate all of the basil that they brought to our table. I always get the chicken Pho or Summer rolls which are amazing. I have also tried some of the other dishes (vermicelli plates, sandwiches) and everything is good. I just love the Pho!! They do mess up your order from time to time so if you are grabbing take-out make sure to check before you leave!!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on a rainy night and was pleasantly surprised by the tasty pho and perfect spring rolls. Friendly staff and great prices. I'll be back when I'm Charlotte and need my weekly pho!"}
{"text":"We had some great Pho, Vermicelli, and freshed brewed vietnamese coffee. There was no wait on the Saturday we went and they even have more tables upstairs. The food was great and priced reasonably too."}
{"text":"Good pho for cheap in downtown, what else do you need?  Well, service was a little off, but honestly, I don't know if they should even have servers.  I could just as easily buy my drinks at the counter and bus my own table.

I'm not going to tell you its amazing, because it isn't.  At $6.75 a small bowl and $8.50 a large bowl though, who cares.  I'm not sure if there is a better deal downtown.  The small should be plenty enough for most people's lunch.  Of course I had to go big though.

All the basic accoutrements, fresh basil, extremely crispy bean sprouts, and some sliced jalapeno came out quickly.  Something to snack on while you wait I guess.  It only took 5 minutes for the pho though.  I liked it more than Pho Real, but not quite up there with Ben Thahn, Vietnam Grille, and the like.  It just didn't have quite the depth of flavor.  That said, no complaints on the food.  I did spend some time without water and they weren't even very busy.

Bottom line is, I will tell every living soul that I know downtown about this place while its cold out.  People need to know."}
{"text":"Five stars amazing food flavor fusion! The flavors are complex but simple. This noodle shop was amazing service was incredible as well!"}
{"text":"I have had great experiences with this place. I am not a huge pho fan to begin with, but decided to try this place for lunch on a work day. I got carryout. The staff was very friendly and my food was ready quickly. The pho was very good and had a lot of meat and veggies in it. The to go set up is really nice and they separate everything for you to mix together yourself. I have also been for dine in lunch and the food was just as excellent. The service is great and the place fills up quickly! I would recommend based on my experience."}
{"text":"I went with my friend and we ordered spicy tofu, curry beef brisket with rice, garlic breads. They were so good that we finished them all. The staff is friendly and we didn't have to wait for so long. I've been here for 2 times and definitely we will go back !!!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in the alley. Easy and quick pho for a meal on the go.  Not the best I've had,  not the worst.  Solid option when you're in the area.  Service was quick and we were in and out in under 45 min."}
{"text":"If you're reading this review right now, and Pho Plus is open, drop what you're doing, quit your job, divorce your husband/wife, and walk -- no, RUN there as fast as you can to go get their pork Bahn Mi sandwich.  The rest of the menu is essentially irrelevant.  Those sandwiches is so damn good."}
{"text":"Pho Plus is an average establishment for Charlotte. I have tried  most menu items and I would say they are all edible but none of them pack a great deal of flavor. I am guessing it is a case of you have to know your audience. I'm not sure that Charlotte is ready for authentic Pho yet. In fairness, my comparison is to Orange County and San Jose California. Pho Plus could not survive there but it is just adventurous enough for Charlotte."}
{"text":"The food was good, however the service is so horrible that I had to give it less stars. I would avoid this place if you actually have a schedule to keep. I understand it can be busy during lunch, but the servers were unorganized, forgot items, lost our ticket, and messed up the orders. They need to organize themselves, and have a better system. They were walking around looking lost and confused wondering who ordered what. We asked for our drinks 3 times. Finally my colleague got up and attempted to get her own drink. When we asked for our ticket to leave, the waiter stated she lost our ticket. So I said welp I lost some of the items we ordered. Overall, good food and if I returned it would be a call ahead order to go. Watching the waiters run around so lost, and confused made me not want to sit in there anymore. Once they work out an actual server system (assigned tables/sections) then they may have a better chance."}
{"text":"I don't have a strong base for comparison, but I love this place. I usually stop in during lunch break from work. I've had positive experiences with dine-in and take-out. The shrimp summer rolls are a pretty tasty appetizer, but it's a lot so I'd suggest sharing it (it's two large sized rollers per order). I've had the chicken pho, vegetarian pho, and shrimp fried rice; they were all pretty tasty but I think the chicken pho is my favorite. The broth is very flavorful in both soups, but the tofu that came in the vegetarian was a little too soft for me. The broth is tasty enough that I could eat it by itself, and when I do takeout I sometimes do just that. All in all, this is a great little lunch spot that I'd recommend to anyone - especially on a chilly day!"}
{"text":"Everything a Bahn Mi sandwich should have. 
Crispy bread. Fresh veggies and flavorful pork. 

The service was good and quick. 

Surprisingly it was pretty empty but don't let that deter you or you'll miss out."}
{"text":"I loooooooove being able to have Chow Mein and Pho in the same restaurant, so instantly pleased.  And even though I did not order pho this time, it's nice to know you have both Chinese and Vietnamese options to satisfy alllll the cravings.

I went around 8:45 pm on a Sunday, and considering they close at 10, there were a few tables taken when we got in and a few more arrived after us. Did not feel rushed to order or eat, which was nice.

The staff was friendly enough, yet not quite as attentive as I prefer servers to be. The dishes we ordered took a little bit longer to come out than many other Asian restaurants I have been to, but was worth it in the end. 

My friend ordered a shot of Russian Standard vodka and it was served in a whisky glass, instead of a shot glass.

Ordered * fried egg noodle with vegetables * brisket curry * pork hot pot * beef ribs.

I don't think I could live without egg noodles in my life, and I'm not often a fan of the crispy style but these noodles were actually thoroughly enjoyed, and the dish did not have any veggies I dislike (fungus!) -- i destroyed it and would eat it again.

Brisket curry was spiiiiiicy. A really good kick, in the back of the throat not on the tongue. The meat was a little too fatty for my liking. Served with some fresh bread that was super soft and quite decent. Naan+curry is life but this was still satisfying. 

I don't eat pork, so I can't speak on that dish but I can say that my friend didn't finish it, and was \"meh\" about it. 

Im not a big meat eater so I can't comment past the sauce the sauce on the ribs was flavourful as F. Too sweet for my liking but needless to say, my dining partner destroyed them.

Will probably make this a regular go to spot."}
{"text":"this place is a lil hidden gem if u love viet food.  pho is good and the broth flavorful but the real surprise is the bahn mi sandwiches.  very good.  got the pork and added a lil pate...delish. I'll now crave one at least once a week.  def worth a try!"}
{"text":"Besides from the amazingly friendly service they provided, the food was delicious.

We started with the summer rolls and quail for appetizers. Both very tasty!

Next came the Pho! The Hot & Sour Seafood was hugely proportioned and delightful all around!

Overall, this was a great restaurant with awesome service!!!"}
{"text":"I've visited several times strictly for pho takeout--always piping hot and delicious.  Yummy.  Visited today with my wife and burned a Groupon.  She ordered vermicelli combo (shrimp and beef) and thought it was good and tasty, but thought they scrimped on the shrimp (4 small ones).  I had the chicken and beef combo with steamed rice and was pleased with the quantity and flavors.  I would order it again.

A few weaknesses which I think could see some improvement are not related to their great food. I'd prefer no TV's in the dining room, a wider selection of tea, and a few more choices of sauces to accompany the food.  I like this place and hope they make it

Good food, great value, friendly staff."}
{"text":"I may not be the best reviewer for this place since this is the first and only place I have ever had Pho from but then again, maybe that is a good thing because I keep coming back for the Pho! 

If its a rainy day, sunny day, or just a bad day - Pho will give you all the warm and fuzzies inside and make you feel comforted! This is also an all-around good meal when you've eaten too many servings of pizza over the weekend and want something light to eat. I love that you are able to customize the pho a bit, I always get the chicken one and add broccoli to get my veggies in and I ask for no cilantro 'cause I'm one of those people who think it tastes like soap! For around $10 bucks, this a good deal in Uptown Charlotte - especially if you save your leftovers in the little soup plastic container they give you. The only reason I docked them a star is because I'm 1000% sure that the broccoli is frozen broccoli that they defrost before putting in the soup, its definitely not fresh but I mean the pho is all about the broth right? :)"}
{"text":"So happy my wife brought me to this place.  A little taste of Vietnam, but with bold flavors and exceptional service.  A definite Charlotte gem!!"}
{"text":"The pho was good and broth was tasty. They have the menu decently priced. I got the pho, P1, with steak, meatballs and brisket. The service was a little on slower side during lunch time. I would come back for the pho and next time try the banh mi."}
{"text":"I haven't had the pleasure of actually tasting the food because they closed before the hours that were posted online. The website and Yelp states they close at 8pm. I attempted to visit at 7pm and they were completely closed and all lights were off. I'm assuming they do most of their business at lunch but need to update their info so guest don't go out of their way to come visit them."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch and was very disappointed with my meal. Before I go on, I want to let everyone know that the PHO here is very good! Guess that's why they call it PHO Plus, huh? You get a great bowl of Pho and a good amount of it making for a great value.

It's everything else that's the problem. Take a look at my related picture. Iceburg lettuce, a couple small slices of cucumber and tomato, and ONE TEENY TINY skewer of.....oh, what is that, beef? Really? That was literally ONE BITE of beef! Was it good? Yupper. The chicken had that semi-sweet weird color sauce but it really was equally good. But there were 2 very thin pieces of chicken here, over a handful of (semi-fried) rice. For $9.00! Most Asian places would give you a LOT more for your money.

Here's a few other quirks that I can't stand. One. NO KNIVES at the table! So, guess you'll have to shred your egg rolls, chicken, pork and beef with your forks. Waiters are tough to come by at lunch.

The one thing that I REALLY can't stand is that YOU HAVE TO QUEUE BACK INTO THE ORDER LINE TO PAY YOUR BILL!!!!! Whiskey Tango Foxtrot?$#@!*& WHY do I have to stand in an ORDERING line to pay my bill? I'll tell you why. The old Asian guy who must be the owner most likely doesn't trust his servers with money and he is the ONLY guy who handles payment. When there is nobody in the restaurant, this is not a problem. However, at lunch time when it IS busy, I don't want to have to wait in an ORDER line to pay my bill! It took me like 15+ minutes to pay my bill. That is UNACCEPTABLE! This practice gets MINUS 100 STARS! STUPIDO!

Bottom line: 1) Only order the Pho. 2) Go during a non-busy time so that you don't have to wait through the order line to pay your bill."}
{"text":"Their Pho is extremely good. The broth has a home style taste to it versus commercial like some Pho places. If I don't have to use  hoisin sauce or sriracha for your Pho, then it's actually really good Pho...! The Banh Mi is really great as well. The portion size for the Banh Mi and Pho is priced really great as well. Will be coming back often."}
{"text":"Some of the best Vietnamese food I've found in Charlotte.  Definitely the best Bahn Mi (pork sandwich), it had an amazing, fresh baked, crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside baguette with fresh cilantro, cucumber, jalapeño, daikon radishes, basil, carrots and bean sprouts on top of delicious, marinated, crispy grilled pork slices.  If you've never had Bahn mi before do yourself a favor and come here and order the Pork sandwich, you won't be disappointed.  Plus it is filling but not real heavy so perfect for lunch at work.  The Pho was also very good and the chicken fried rice was amazing.  Can't really say anything bad about this place.  The restaurant itself is really clean and new and the upstairs seating is very spacious.  EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Cheap, delicious, and I can order it and go enjoy a beer somewhere else in brevard court. I have had the beef pho and the banh mi. Both fantastic. The broth is very tasty and the portions are huge. Great bang for your buck. I will continue to frequent this pho gem.

I've never sat down and eaten at this place but the to-go service has been nice and a little slow. But slow is a small price to pay for a cheap delicious meal."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day and got the regular Chicken Pho ($8.95). It came with a side of bean sprouts, Vietnamese basil, jalapeños and lime. The Pho broth was excellent and served with cilantro which gave it a nice refreshing flavor. I also added the bean sprouts, 2 jalapeños, sriracha and lime into my bowl- it was on point! If you like it spicy, I highly recommend my combination. I was also very surprised that there were so many noodles in my bowl! It was never ending. Sadly, it finally ended and I was \"pho\" full. 

Overall, Pho Plus was a great, fast lunch option. I will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"I LOVE vietnamese food.  Nothing beats a great bowl of pho when it's cold or I'm not feeling well, bahn mi is one of my favorite sandwiches, and a bun (rice noodles with veggies, meat and fish sauce) with shrimp can really make my day.  

As far as I know, Pho Plus is the only vietnamese restaurant uptown - so, I go there occasionally for lunch.  Their pho is adequate, but I think the broth is a little bland.  The bahn mi is also fine, but can be a bit dry and lacking flavor.  The bun - the same, just average.   The decor - well, similar to the food, pretty unremarkable.  

That being said, l go there to get my vietnamese fix in the middle of the day. You can stand in line and get take out or sit at the tables to dine in."}
{"text":"They trim vermicelli small so people can not use chopsticks , they can use spoons to enjoy Vietnamese food! Great"}
{"text":"Sandwiches are the best thing to get from here. Service is good. Bubble tea and pho are not good here at all. Pick any Vietnamese place in Charlotte and the pho will be better than here. However, they have the monopoly on uptown so they'll continue getting a ton of business."}
{"text":"I'm upgrading my review by a star because I think this restaurant deserves it. While the banh mi (sandwich) bread (yes, the bread is what I'm focused upon) isn't perfection, I think it's good. The contents are fine. 

But the pho (soup) and the vermicelli with grilled pork won me over. Their grilled pork is very tender and tasty!  The pho broth is good, too. I had expected a lesser quality broth given that they are primarily a quick lunch crowd; like who's going to notice, right?  But I was more than satisfied with the taste of both dishes. 

And the ambience with the soothing classical music makes for a nude respite during the work day. If you want quieter seating, go sit at the tables upstairs. 

Great job, guys!"}
{"text":"Now let me start off with the fact that I am not an experienced pho connoisseur and this was actually only my second time getting pho. That being said, this place was bomb! The broth itself was so good the rest almost didn't matter, but it does so I will add that the noodles, chicken and flavoring were on point. They have two sizes, medium and large and the medium is plenty! Unless your a super eater like my bf who got the large (see photo) and finished it. I ordeeedbthe chicken pho and he ordered the mixed meat.

We also ordered the summer rolls which were good, but had a lot of mint and basil (which they are supposed to) but if you aren't used to Thai cuisine it can be a bit much. The peanut sauce was perfect tho and everything was delicious. We'll definitely be back and I reccomend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I have been to Pho Plus on several occasions and noticed that their customer services have improved since they opened.  While the Pho and Banh Mi is DECENT the meat content is on the low side.  I wish they would include more meat in the Pho and Banh Mi.  The price is very similar to other Pho and Banh Mi restaurants, but the meat is lacking.  Maybe they rent is higher and they cannot afford to put too much meat in their products.  If that was the case, increase the price a little bit.  Alot of us do not mind a higher price so long as the products are up to par.  So for now, if I want Pho i would go to Doan's Vietnamese restaurant off of South Boulevard.  For Banh Mi, I would go to Le's Sandwiches & Cafe off of North Tryon/Sugar Creek.  When I am downtown and desperate for some Vietnamese food, I would go to Pho Plus.  I hope they would change, as this place has lots of potential!!!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Vietnamese food for the price around Charlotte. I prefer the authentic version of Pho that's full of fatty brisket and tripe but the flavor of the broth here is good. You cannot find a better Bahn Mi sandwich around town. It's huge and cheap and the most authentic seasoning on the grilled pork. Just how  I used to get in Little Saigon. I hope that they expand their menu to include a wider selection of sandwiches and other dishes but I'm sure to make this my go to place for Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch last week and i like it.
It's not the best PHO I've ever eaten but its a good PHO, the broth is pretty good, the sizes and pricing is solid too.
We had some of the side dishes too which were good.
If you in the mood for PHO, it's the only one around."}
{"text":"Definitely not authentic Vietnamese. I ordered the banh cuon and the whole thing ended up being soggy due to the cooked lettuce (who boils lettuce and puts it on top of banh cuon!?) The banh cuon also kept falling apart. Service was quick though and utensils and tables were clean - those were the only positives that are preventing Pho Plus from getting a 1 star."}
{"text":"Had the veggie pho and chicken sandwich. Both were very good. I think the pho should have had way more veggies. Barely any broccoli. The sandwich was very yummy. Food was cheap too!
Sanitation score was an 87 which was scary but the food was very good. I'm sure not much is wrong in the back. 
I recommend."}
{"text":"One day walking around in uptown, I discovered this amazing restaurant. It's small but clean, nice setting up and sneezing good! Asian style, familiar. I love Bun Dac Biet noodle with grilled pork and shrimp! Staffs are young, good looking . I love Vietnamese milk coffee and Banh Mi is incredible! The best Banh Mi in town!!!! Everyone must try! After several times had lunch here, then I knew they have beautiful upstairs, good space for a romantic dinner dating! Come back? Of course can't agree more!"}
{"text":"I ordered a #1 beef pho.. Beef broth was bland.. Avocado smoothie was super sweet and the tapioca balls weren't fresh and 'chewy'. The beef meatball tasted 'old' or had that freezer burn smell.. Other than that, the location was cute and convenient to those on feet touring downtown Charlotte.."}
{"text":"This is a great and affordable lunch option. I was very impressed with the portion size. And service was quick. We got our food more quickly than our friends did at the pizza place nearby.

For the food. They have bahn mi, pho and other Vietamese dishes. I ordered the pork bahn mi and some summer rolls. The bahn mi was huge. The pork had a good flavor,  but wasn't as tender as I would like it to be. I liked the vegetables, but wish the sandwich had more. The bun was spot on to hold all the flavors in. It was refreshing for a hot day. The summer rolls were good. By themselves, they were a little bland, but the peanut sauce was great. I'd like to try the pho, but maybe not on a day when it's 90 degrees. The meal did fill me up the rest of the day.

All in all, It's a great value and I'll keep it on my list of lunch options."}
{"text":"The owner here also own another Pho Plus, in uptown I believe! This one is located in Asian corner strip mall, decent size space. We came on the week they just opened, and they actually had a few customers already wow! They serve banh mi, variety of pho's & bubble teas. I ordered the tofu banh mi, and taro bubble tea. The banh mi was okay, it was good but nothing outstanding. (Compare to Le's next door, I think I prefer Le's better) The taro tea was also okay, it was too sweet for my taste. My mom had their seafood pho, it was pretty good, there was a good amount of seafood! And service here was awesome, the owner personally took our order & he was so kind! Overall I don't think I would be back, because nothing really stood out to me, but if I were to go back I wouldn't mind, ya know?"}
{"text":"Not a good service day. I had three different servers come to my table. One interrupted my meal twice to replenish condiments but not ask if I wanted more water or if I needed anything else. One server told me they do not serve tea and another server had no problem bringing me a cup of tea. Huh?

The meatballs in the Pho Beef were cold in the middle. In addition, the bread for the sandwiches is different from when I first ate there a few weeks ago. It's no longer a crusty baguette that is soft inside...it's now a very soft loaf. It's not bad. Just different.

Once the lunch rush arrived I was forgotten and had to take my leftovers to the cashier to provide me with a container. 

Service here is always different based on the server working that day. This may be an issue for groups who are looking for quick efficient service during their short lunch break. You might find yourself frustrated.

Overall, the food is good and very affordable. It's best to carryout if you plan to go between 11:30a - 1p. Don't say I didn't warn you."}
{"text":"Vegetarian pho was some of the best I've had in a while! The \"to go\" order was very fast and it was a huge portion of many ingredients. Lots of noodles, tofu, broccoli, onions, basil, sauces, and some crunchy toppings that I've never had and were yummy! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price!  The pho is the only thing I have gotten and I am addicted.  It's super fast and a great place for a working lunch.  Recommend the medium and it is huge and the large is really just more broth (same amount of noodles, veggies and broth).  If you like pho and are uptown, strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"Very friendly people, during lunch is very busy, fast service, great place in uptown to get Pho & eat Vietnamese food! I would definitely recommend eating here if you haven't tried it yet. - Chris Porfeli

{"text":"Banh Mi and Pho Uptown? Well, sign me up.
So far I've only had the pork sandwich with the Pate added. It was one the most delicious sandwiches I've had in a while. Caution though, it does pack a bit of a kick. But at $4.50, it is a steal!
100% I'll be back. Especially when it is colder out. That warm Pho is going to hit the spot."}
{"text":"This is my go to pho place. Service is always great and quick for lunch. The pho and the bubble tea are amazing. There are all the add ins you'd ever need and the pho is consistently yummy. Great option when you're craving pho!"}
{"text":"I ordered the combination pho (beef, meatball, brisket) and the soup base was tasty without anything extra, but adding the thai basil, bean sprouts, lime, hoisin sauce and sriracha (all provided) allowed you to play with it and make it your own. I've never had pho before so I can't offer comparisons, but in my opinion, its still worth it.  I would definitely go back."}

I will come again, I highly recommend it."}

{"text":"This is probably the worst Pho restaurant in the city of Toronto.  Do yourself a favor and avoid.  Lacking in basic customer service standards.  You're welcome."}
{"text":"I came back for the pho twice in one week! The broth is so delicious & there are such healthy portions too for the most affordable prices. 

Its unbelievable that there is 1. Good Viet food in Charlotte & 2. It's located conveniently in the French quarter. 

To top it off, the owner is the sweetest guy. He's so welcoming and friendly to everyone who steps foot in the door. It's a very authentic mom and pop restaurant & you should give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Very very good pho. 
I liked the customer service and the appetizers (we had fresh spring roll with shrimp and chicken) and mango salad
And we had seafood pho! Yumm 
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"oh my I'm reviewing another pho place aren't I? I'm nothing if not eating a bowl of pho at least once a month.

tucked away off the main road here in a plaza you see it if you're looking up around at the sign. lots of parking.

The menu is a little confusing but there is the house special pho dac biet is there. I got the smaller size as I was having lunch before a meeting. listen I hate giving 3 stars or less as I have to justify it and I always give the benefit of the doubt plus I try to focus on value, food quality, service and atmosphere, but to me this pho wasn't particularly memorable.

sure it was fine and it did the job of filling me up but nothing really stood out. broth, sure it had flavour but nothing super fresh, not the best one I've had. cuts of meat and noodles, yes they were there but again, nothing super tender or uber tasty.

If you're in the area, you're not wrong for coming here, it's not bad value for the money. not my first choice but not a bad choice either. not a home run but a solid single opposite field"}
{"text":"This got to be the best Pho in the States. I am a US/VNese airline pilot.  On all my layovers, I use this app to find a decent Pho place.  So far this is one of my top 5 place in the country.  The cleanliness, friendly staffs and Pho is as good as home cooking.  No doubt the owner is cooking this in a traditional way...overnight long deep cooking of the broth.  Def coming back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Get the grilled Pork bahn mi sandwhich and summer rolls (the A2 & S2). Also lately been really into their Thai Bubble Tea (served over ice is the way to do it) even though these are loaded w sugar they are a tasty treat."}
{"text":"I'm amazed the other reviews are good.  We got the Pho soup, 1 chicken and 1 combo, today for lunch.  There are definitely better places in Charlotte for Pho Soup!  Although you get an average size portion, the price is expensive and it wasn't all that good.  

Also, the health rating is an 87.5 which I didn't see until after we ordered.  This is a no go usually in my book."}
{"text":"Pho Plus is far from perfect, but I'll be damned if it isn't one of the best weekday lunch spots in Uptown. The prices are reasonable, the service is quick, and the food is always delicious.

My go-to is the chicken pho. They use breast meet sliced thin, and it's perfect every time. The broth is very flavorful and the noodles are plentiful. I've also had the beef pho and the combination pho; they're all winners. When it's too hot outside for me to properly enjoy a steaming bowl of pho, I go with the chargrilled pork bun. I can't speak to any of the juices or teas they serve; I've been at least a dozen times and I've never seen anyone order something from the bar downstairs.

Speaking of, the upstairs and downstairs feel like two separate restaurants, but that's not a bad thing. The upstairs is great for a lunch with coworkers; they'll move tables together for you and you'll have a great meal near the bright windows. But if you're on a lunch date, the booths on the ground floor are just private enough for you to make eyes at your partner. Best of both worlds.

My biggest complaint about Pho Plus has nothing to do with the food, but the restroom. The door has a doorknob instead of a handle, so after I've washed my hands I have to wrap my fingers around the doorknob to leave, and I always feel like I've undone anything hygienic I had achieved. Though, really, it's a small price to pay."}
{"text":"Pretty cool location.  The pho was okay not that bad and the price was fair.  Service was great.  Had the taro bubble tea and it wasn't that delicious.  It had a really bad after taste compared to most that I've had."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since it's been on my list of lunch places to try uptown.  I got it to go because I like to eat at my desk and there really wasn't a place to sit. Maybe there's additional seating upstairs. 

The pho is decent. Maybe it would've been better if I ate it there since it would've been fresh in the bowl. Not that the to go wasn't fresh. Some things are just meant to be eaten in house. The pho for me is one of them.   Luckily though they gave me a cup for the broth and put the contents in a styrofoam to go box to keep them fresh. I'm giving three stars instead of four or five because I got the seafood pho, which contains crab shrimp and a fishball, but the crab is artificial crab. It's a personal preference. When I have crab I like it to be the real thing. Aside from that after I warmed it up in the microwave because I like my food super hot it was pretty delicious. 

The people there were very nice. They also serve a variety of bubble teas and flavored teas. I got a sweet tea on accident, which was more like liquid diabetes. They mixed some unsweet in for me, which is what I should've got. The tea tasted fresh and not over brewed or stale like some places. Overall I would probably come back for times when I need something warm and comfy for chilly southern days."}
{"text":"I just love this place, for lots of reasons: close to home, close to work, friendly staff, flavorful pho. Admittedly, my basis for comparison is limited (I've only tried pho at one other place). Dine-in is always better but I've gotten pho to go before and enjoyed it just as well. I typically do the chicken pho with a side of shrimp spring rolls. This is a nice little gem in the arcade strip. Definitely check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This place does not make good food. This is not authentic vietnamese flavors. The pho noodle soup does not taste good. Every portion including the vietnamese latte, grilled pork with rice and shrimp skewers are just too small. 

How is anyone going to get full? I give two stars for the waiter because he was nice. If he was not nice I will give a 1 star. The foods are just not good. 

Portions are extremely small !!!!!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the Monday night football game and decided to walk to this place from our hotel.  My brother and I both love Pho.  This place turned out to be pretty good.  They accommodated my brother's vegan diet and he was happy with his bowl.  Price was right.  Highly recommend.  Wait staff was informal but friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Good Pho. Really friendly staff. Got the medium (aka small) combo, which was plenty of good. Beef ball was excellent. Cost $8. 

Ordered unsweet tea, which was swill.

Quick and good. Small place, but I got a table with no wait at 1230."}
{"text":"Ok so I tried this place because I do love good Vietnamese food. Service was nice. I received my food in a timely manner. I was excited for this place. I order the grilled shrimp vermicelli and spring roll. I did take out. I work across the street so it was a short route. I was displeased with the fact my food was cold. I only walk a short distance so wasn't expected it to be cold. I warm the dish up to my liking. I was a good dish. I give this place 2 star because for the 10 minute I waited I would have except a warm meal. Also they have been sited in the sanitation scoring for food temperatures. Not really looking to go back to this place until the get their sanitation grade up. I really had high hopes for this place. - Disappeared luncher"}
{"text":"My 1st visit here was great. 
2nd visit was just as tasty. 
3rd and most recent visit surprised me with a $4 increase in cost. 
Cool, I get the rent has to be paid and suspect the location costs a pretty penny. 

HOWEVER, the flavor was off and the noodle texture was funky. But for $10.70...erigh ahhh yeahhhh.... I need this to be as wonderful as my first trip. 

I've only dined in during the 2nd visit and service was fine. 
The to go order taker did clarify and correct me over the phone the $6 small no longer existed. I prefer brisket over all other meat options. 
They always include the brown and re sauces but skipped my limes on the 3rd visit. 

Based on the cost; and they are the only real Pho option Uptown, I will make it my business to find other options in NODA and get back to Saigon Palace when given options. 

This isn't a priority place any longer - not for $10 lunch pho."}
{"text":"Giving this restaurant 1 star. I have eaten here twice and felt very bad both times. I have only ordered food to go but pho should be very hot, hot enough to at least cook the raw meat. When I get back to my office the meat is not cooked like it should and the broth is just warm and it's only a 3 min walk away. Also this place cleanliness is very low."}
{"text":"Went here last night...ok...but there are better.  The rare beef pho was not so rare, but tasted good...and seemed to have less sodium than other places. The shrimp fresh rolls were also pretty tasty. The other person I was with ordered shrimp with rice and chicken...there was some sort of lumpy sauce on the shrimp (only one of them) and the chicken looked ok.  They do have a number of Chinese dishes on the menu...we did not try them, but if some people want Pho and some people want Chinese, this could be a good place for you to visit."}
{"text":"It might be in the high 90s today, but a hot bowl of pho tai will always be comforting. Not the best pho but conveniently located in Brevard Court. The banh mi is decent, I've had better. I personally try not to order the summer rolls just because my dad's are so much better with tons of fresh herbs. Service is super fast."}
{"text":"Pho is delicious. Glad to find a good Vietnamese place in CLT. Not the same as LA, but pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"I've tried the pho bowls here and they are pretty good, but the pork bahn mi sandwich is outstanding. Flavor the whole way through as they combine the buttery bread with pork, jalapenos, cucumber, carrots, cilantro and some delicious sauce. Has a little kick and as already mentioned plenty of other flavor combinations. If you're looking for a quick lunch order one for takeout and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came down Saturday afternoon looking for I don't even remember what, got all turned around trying to figure out parking and which way streets and when I finally stopped the car I was lost and directly in front of the Latta Arcade; the signage says \"Shops and Dining\" so why not? Inside are a lot of shops not trying very hard, out back are a bunch of food options trying way too hard plus Pho Plus trying just right...
Place has kinda of a Blade Runner feel to it except without the gloom, the rain, the flying cars, the neon, and it isn't post-global-environment-event Los Angeles. Like every pho place I've been to the sizes are medium and large - apparently no Vietnamese word translates to 'small'. Order from the big board behind the cashier and the soup will find you at one of the tables or the counter facing out the front window. 
A delicious noodley soup that delivers everything that the AHCA promised: strong clear broth, substantial pieces of beef and balled meats, greens (herbs, pepper, citrus), and plenty of spicy warm goodness that will cure whatever ails you. Soy-, Hoisin-, and sriracha sauce are on the table as are salt, pepper, other pepper paste in oil, and chop sticks.
I could walk around with a hot cup of pho all day every day and I'd never have a bad day again. If you've had then you know, if not then no."}
{"text":"This was a ways from or office but I'm happy we ventured out because his place was nice. It's down a small alley and the place is small but they have 2 stories. The food came out pretty fast. I mean it should since everything is basically already done. I had the pho combination. The broth was perfect, no addition seasoning needed expect for Sriracha since I like it spicy. The medium bowl was enough for me. Didn't even have room for dessert or boba tea. Moderately priced considering its uptown."}
{"text":"This was my second time visiting this eatery and it was still as good as the first time. Wasn't as crowded this time. Seated ourselves and the waiter came over right away to take our drink order. For some reason they don't give out menus as you sit. Both visits we had to ask for menus. My girlfriend and I both got the pho combination medium which was a perfect serving size for us. Food came out really fast which is a must for us considering we were on our lunch break. The broth was seasoned well and all I added was the veggies and Sriracha. Your meal ticket is left on the table for you so you can just get up after you are done and head to the cashier to pay. Moderately priced for a place uptown."}
{"text":"When you want to take pho one step further, slide on into Pho Plus.  I judge Vietnamese restaurants by their pho dac biet.  The closest that Pho+ has to this is rare steak/meatball/brisket. As far as the food itself:
Broth - unbelievable
Noodles, accoutrements (bean sprouts, herbs, jalapenos, lime) - excellent
Other - person I was eating with got a piece of a plastic wrapper in his food.   Was good enough that he just took it out and finished his meal, but worth noting.

The service was somewhat lacking - when I walked it, there were zero people there.  I guess they were back in the kitchen, but I even tried calling out to no avail.  Was finally seated afyter about 10-15 minutes when someone finally strolled out of the back.  This was at 6:45PM on a Wednesday.  After that the service fine.

If not for the plastic wrapper and initial service situation, would definitely be a 5*.  The pho is very, very good."}
{"text":"very convenient to the office I was working in this week.  My first visit was awful.  Obvious they were short staffed.  waited 15 minutes for my order to be taken.  Had the chicken pho.  It was good

My second visit I ordered the pork banh mi.  It was lacking in flavor and the char taste from a grill.  Decent price though.  I did not like the smoothie."}
{"text":"Very convenient to where I work and the prices don't break the bank for a sit down lunch. I'd recommend eating in for the pho, since when I ordered take out, it's just not the same out of those plastic cylinder containers. The pho is good, better than the banh mi. And I seem to keep stopping by just to order the frozen taro bubble tea. I'm addicted. Also, cash required for anything less than $8 or something."}
{"text":"How cold was it last week? Super Cold. And Friday in freezing weather should be Pho Fridays for sure. This place is big and busy but service is fast. I love the summer rolls and the Pho here. I've had the Bahn Mi before but much prefer the Pho. I'm spoiled by Le's. 

But the Pho (I got chicken) comes in medium and large and I find medium to be hugh and large to feed a family of 4. Medium is plenty of food especially for lunch. Especially depending on how much of the sprouts, jalapenos and basil they give you to add. I'll be back for Pho Friday before too long."}
{"text":"We heard about this new restaurant through a flyer in our mailbox. There aren't a whole lot of vietnamese restaurants in the thornhill area so we though we would check this place out, as it has a 10% grand opening discount. Woot.

Entering this plaza (the one with the shoppers drug mart and td canada trust bank) is tricky / a nightmare if you are coming from steeles going westbound. There's always a huge ass line up to turn left at the light, and people get pissed if you block the left turn lane to enter the plaza (there is no middle turning lane available). And the parking lot is not very big, but doesn't take too long to find a spot.

So anyway we got here for dinner, and there was no one else here except for us, later on there were two guests who dined in. The interior was nice, clean, tidy. There were some interesting paintings on the wall. There was one that was quite the conversation starter...can't remember if it was two ladies changing into their clothes or whether they were bathing themselves lol.

Pro tip: do not try to order your meal/ converse with the server in Vietnamese. No one in the restaurant will understand you as all servers seem to be Chinese and do not understand Vietnamese. 

This made for an extremely awkward experience and a bit of a suspicion as to whether our food was going to be good... Though, I have been to plenty of Vietnamese restaurants that were bad and made by Vietnamese people so who's to say it has to be a Vietnamese chef to make good Vietnamese food, lol. But it was just shocking as I have never been to a Vietnamese restaurant in the GTA where the servers couldn't understand Vietnamese. Anyway, shouldn't be a problem for most people though as it seems like this restaurant is more catered to a western demographic. It was only when we ended our meal and had a look at the outdoor restaurant banner and noticed the \"Vietnamese and Chinese Cuisine\" header under the restaurant name, which is fine and makes sense.

Onto my meal. It was alright. The soup was good, on the lighter side. But what I did not appreciate was that my rice noodles were clumped up/stuck together in the soup until I tried to separate them with my chopsticks. For the price I think it was good value and tasted nice."}
{"text":"Really good place for pho. Whenever it is kind of rainy day or cloudy, i usually go here. I usually sit down for my food so i can get the good taste of my pho."}
{"text":"Great value and taste!! Simple menu with fresh food. Wish the refilling on beverage could be better. Otherwise I'd go back regularly. Oh! Make sure you take out the jalapeño in the sandwich if you don't like too much heat."}
{"text":"After living in vancouver and California i consider myself a picky person when it comes to pho. Expectations were low but this place has quite good pho. I wanted pho with rare beef, the option was not on the menu but they offered to substitute the meatballs for the rare beef (they got me there already!). 
Vietnamese coffee was also quite decent."}
{"text":"Been waiting for this place to open for a while. Went on a whim and wasn't disappointed. When I tell you the BROTH is amazing. It's AMAZING!!!!! If it wasn't so \"oily\" I guess it would be perfect. But I have nothing but good things to say. I'll def be back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I've always had good food when I've come here. I usually get the pork banh me or the chicken and rice and both are very tasty! The pho is also good- not the best I've had but definitely still a great option. The menu is simple but all you need for a lunch place and the service is fast. 

The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because the health rating isn't very good which is a little scary. I also think there are some better quality Vietnamese restaurants in charlotte but this is still a fantastic lunch option uptown. Most of the good places are super far out so pho plus definitely gets points for convenience."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. The cashier misunderstood my order as a more expensive item than I actually ordered and rang me up incorrectly, which I did not notice until after I checked my order when I sat down to eat. I came back to the restaurant to exchange my food for the correct order. I had to explain my issue to the cashier 3 times before she understood the problem and went to the kitchen to request what I had initially ordered. She was surly at having to correct her mistake and did not apologize. I was given the correct order in exchange but no effort was made to correct the difference in price. Very disappointed in the service here and will choose other Asian restaurants uptown in the future."}
{"text":"Stopped by Pho Plus for the first time yesterday! I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly our waiter brought everything to the table! I had the Pho Combination! I normally go to Pho Hoa, but seeing as Pho Plus is now just a few blocks away, I will be going here! The Small bowl of Pho is actually pretty big! For only $6.95... I think I'll eat here everyday for the rest of my life! Great flavor, and the waiter was very nice and respectful! He said thank you so many times, it was unreal!"}
{"text":"I'm tempted to give 4 stars for the location. But based on the food alone it's gets three.   I'm happy to have a pho place in Uptown that I can walk to in a couple of minutes from office instead of having to get in my car if I get a Vietnamese craving during the work day. The food is fine. The service is good. And the place is clean. That said, if this establishment were next door to Ben Thanh or Vietnam Grille (just to name a couple) I probably wouldn't come back. That's not to say that it is by any means bad. It's just that I feel there are better Vietnamese restaurants in town. But because of the convenience of the location, I will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I think I may have suffered a bit from lofty expectations after reading my fellow yelper's reviews.  Hearing about the greatest sandwich since the Earl himself invented it, I had to try it.  And it was good.  No where near mind-blowing however, and certainly not the best sandwich available in uptown.

The Pho is also pretty good.  The broth (which is the hallmark of Pho) is delicious - worthy of picking up your bowl and crushing it like a college freshman in a beer chugging contest.  The chicken for the Pho, however was blah, tasteless, and dissapointing.  Overall though, good dish, I'd recommend.

The thing they really have going for them is first, they're miles above that dreadful Chinese place that occupied the space previously, and second, they offer good value.

That pork sandwich?  less than $5 and certainly enough food by itself for a healthy appetite.  The Pho?  ~$7 which is a good value given the quality and quantity.

Certainly worth checking it out, but I wouldn't make a special trip."}
{"text":"Great food--I had the grilled pork vermicelli--and friendly and attentive service. I really loved their spring rolls. I'll definitely come back when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great location, great staff and an awesome, simple menu with really good food.  Upstairs will surprise you and definitely try the banh mi.  At $6, it's one of the more affordable and underrated lunch options uptown."}
{"text":"Walked in with no expectations, left very impressed with the quality, amount of food and service. I ordered the Summer Rolls and the combination Pho. The rolls  were quite filling and delicious, but the pho was even better. The 'small' pho I ordered was more than enough to fill me up for lunch. The side  ingredients (bean sprouts, jalapeños, mint, red chili sauce) were excellent editions to the pho. All for about 10$.

Go here, it's easily one of the best asian lunch spots in uptown."}
{"text":"Ok Pho. Fills the craving for Vietnamese fare. The broth is good--but can they really spare the two leaves of basil?  I'm used to a couple of full sprigs of basil at Pho restaurants. Very cheesy. (Not an anomaly since this is what I've been given here on a previous visit.). The server was slightly taken aback when I asked for more. Stop being so cheap."}
{"text":"I must admit, Pho Plus has the best pho broth I've ever had, ever! On top of that, the owner, Vu, is the man! I stopped by for the first time for dinner last week, the bf had it a couple of times before, but he said this was the best experience he's had here. We arrived about an hour before close, there was only one other patron there...I was a little surprised given the good reviews but I'm not complaining, just an observation.

Vu brought us water and seated us right way. We ordered 2 medium chicken pho bowls, I didn't want to chance ordering a large and being stuffed. Surprisingly, our order came out pretty quick and steaming hot. It smelled delicious but tasted even better. I LOVED how fried onions were added to the broth, it made a huge, tasty difference. This was probably the best pho I've ever had. I went to school in Irvine, CA... I've had A LOT of pho in my day. The medium was pretty satisfying, I probably wouldn't get the large ever. We also ordered an almond milk tea with 50/50 black and green tea per Vu's recommendation, it was really good! I was a little nervous of trying milk green tea but it was great. 

We will definitely be back for more...hell, I would come back everyday if I could afford it."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today after it was recommended by several reliable sources. I was in a hurry because i had a lot of work to do, so i went upstairs to be able to eat and work. The service was prompt and helpful, the pho was good. Unfortunately, when I went to pay my check, i noticed their SANITATION RATING was an 87. I am sick! 

I never eat at a place with a rating below a 90, preferably a 93  or better. I would not recommend this place because of the sanitation rating. GROSS!"}
{"text":"Yummy chicken pho and lots of soup for the price. Broth was very flavorful. Didn't even need the hoisin or sriracha added in -- but the sriracha gave it the perfect amount of kick. 

Ordered the pho to go and it came with a large styrofoam contain of noodles, chicken, cilantro, lime wedge, bean sprouts, sriracha and hoisen sauces (usually comes with onion/scallion too, but I ordered without). Broth was packaged in a separate container so everything stayed fresh and crisp. 

I may be biased when it comes to summer rolls because I always think they're amazing, but they were no different here. Light and fresh. I would be ok eating an entire meal of these. 

Will be back! Perfect meal for a cool fall evening."}
{"text":"Officially the best tasting Pho I have ever had in Charlotte! Solid, solid Pho. Nothing fancy, but it hits the spot. I only tried Pho & the summer rolls so I can only base my review off of those two foods. The best tasting pho broth I've tasted.

 The service was friendly and speedy. The restaurant hours are odd. So check before you show up for dinner. And the parking can be tricky since you're in the city. Cute little french quarter location across from BBT ball park- just in case you can't pin point this place."}
{"text":"I love this place. Everyone is friendly and the food is great at an incredible value. I come here for lunch often and will recommend it to friends and family."}
{"text":"This place definitely hits the spot for lunch if you are in the mood for pho, a tasty sammich, or something with rice.  It's located behind the Latta Arcade in Brevard Court so already a win-win location.  There is so much history in the buildings and a very cool part of Uptown to be in.

I first tried this place on a rainy-cold day and the P1 combination did not disappoint.  I've been back a couple times and have tried their appetizers... spring rolls are pretty awesome, but the summer rolls are too if you are looking for a refreshing, non-fried alternative.  Their sandwiches are definitely tasty and fairly priced for the yumminess that you get.  You can't really beat a huge bowl of pho tho... I just love using the spoon in my left hand and chopsticks in my right hand and attacking a great tasting dish for lunch.

This place recently added booths! They used to just have all round tables, but I think the booths they built are nice and provide a bit of privacy with high backs if you are having a lunch date... or like me, reading my kindle by myself :(...

Highly recommend the Vietnamese Iced Latte if you are a coffee drinker... watch out if you aren't a sweets person though.  It's a nice treat or after meal/during drink."}
{"text":"I've been to Pho Plus twice now and had good experiences both times.  It's been around for about a month I believe.  You can tell that the owners are still getting everything figured out but there were no major mishaps.

We had good service for dinner both times when the restaurant was not busy at all.  I would describe the pho broth as being more sweet than I've had at other pho establishments.  I prefer the tangier broth at my favorite pho place on Independence, Pho Huong Que, but it's still good in its own way and you can doctor it up with Sriracha, hoisin, etc.  Protein portions are very generous.  I definitely intend to keep coming back."}
