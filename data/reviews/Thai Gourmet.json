{"text":"Reliably excellent. The Tom Yum soup here is as good as anywhere I've eaten. The pad thai is superb. The curries are perfect. The nam sod is especially good. Always get the brewed oolong tea. This is probably the classiest little place in Stow. Warning: you ask for Thai Hot, they'll really let you have it!"}
{"text":"Great place. Very high price/quality and quantity ratio. There are better/fancier places but if you want a decently=priced dinner, this is your place. My favorite dish is the thai fish cakes: they are an appetizer but are very filling. Papaya salad good too. And the pumpkin curry. I find their noodle dishes are not their best, nor is the sweet and sour dishes."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best for Thai food. Highly recommended very clean sanitized area and friendly customer service . The owners are very friendly . Recommend currys , pad Thai , fried rice , stir frys"}
{"text":"First time there, and it was really good. My wife goes with her work friends and always said she enjoyed it...looking for a place and we were driving by...good decision!"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh.  However, don't venture off the beaten path.  I normally get the Pad Thai or Pad Siew dishes and they're awesome (with generous portion) but the last time I went I got Thai Fish Cakes, Thai somoza, and a basil noodle dish and I did not enjoy anything.  Keep it mainstream and you will be fine.  Don't order anything too unfamiliar."}
{"text":"I've had good and bad experiences throughout the years.  For years I was a big fan of the garlic eggplant, penang chicken and summer tofu.  Near the end of my dining experiences the garlic eggplant was so salty yet bland I couldn't even eat it.  Like someone tossed a whole bottle of msg in there to cover up for the lack of anything else.  That actually kept me from eating at the Thai Gourmet for over a year.  But I recently came back as it is convenient to order lunch/appetizers then hit the pet store and Marc's and then back to pick up my food.  I used to love the Thai Spring Rolls but they changed.  Now they are all meat with no veggies or anything else.  The sweet chili dipping sauce is good through (dig deep and get the ginger!).  Haven't tried the garlic eggplant since I've been back.  The summer tofu is still as good as I remember and if you're into thai basil you'll love the penang chicken.  You can wait in the front of the store for a while before anyone comes to take your order but the food is almost always no more than a 10 to 15 min wait."}
{"text":"We went to Thai Gourmet on a Friday night after we had tried to go to the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern across the street and they were closed for a private party!  Bummer!  Anyway, the overall experience at Thai Gourmet was very positive.   I ordered the crispy Spring rolls, Spicy Coconut chicken soup and Panang chicken curry.   The Spring rolls and soup were excellent and the curry was good, but not the best I have every had.  Don't get me wrong, I would go here again in a heartbeat, but this wasn't as good as some that I've had in the past.  The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable.  Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"They make great vegetarian Thai food - they do tofu right!"}
{"text":"I went here with my two dads who were visiting from Greenland on Saturday and they were unimpressed with the way the place smelled and how it taste.  I liked it."}
{"text":"Love the food! Delicous, would definitely recommend this place to anyone! I particularly enjoyed the Tom kha and the Pad Thai"}
{"text":"I had lunch there today with a friend. Food was amazing. We had coconut chicken soup, pad thai gourmet, and beef lo mein. The food was excellent and it was quick we are in lunch."}
{"text":"We stopped going here when we had kids but recently returned now that they are grown. It is too small for small children.  The food was just as we remembered it and our kids enjoyed it too. The Orange Chicken was a hit with the kids. Plenty of flavor and not too spicy. Their Pad Thai was filled with shrimp and chicken. Tried the Avocado Curry.  Was ok but probably won't order it again. I have had pumpkin curry at other restaurants and was expecting it to be similar.  Needless to say, the other food was exceptional."}
{"text":"The BEST Thai food in Pittsburgh and my husband would argue that it's the best food in general. We order the same meals every time and the staff knows us very well. Perfect dinner spot!"}
{"text":"We visited or get carry out from Thai Gourmet about once a month.    Usually the service is prompt.  The food is mostly very good. For example, the summer chicken is wonderful and the Tom Yum soup is great.  On the downside the Vietnamese beef soup (Pho) is horribly bland.  If Pho is what you are seeking, you can do much better elsewhere in the Akron area.    Find what you like on their menu and stick to it."}
{"text":"This place is legit! I went with a review from someone that used to drive to central or even east Phoenix and I used to do that also, so I trusted his review and was at the door right when they opened at 11. I wish they would open at 10 but that's me. Anyway, long story longer, I will no longer be driving 40to60 miles round trip anymore. It's literally 2 miles round-trip from my house. Very stoked about it. I'm from Chicago. I know good food. Like I said. Very legit!!"}
{"text":"Dat curry!  I've been eating here probably too often ha. If you get the right things on the menu, (it never hurts to have a fob friend) you'll have a good time. And if any restaurant will trick me into eating a salad it's this one. Any salad with mango or beef is ok with me. All the curries are crazy good and their lunch is a spectacular $7 and can totally be halved with a friend or leftovers saved for dinner."}
{"text":"Came here based on the positive Yelp reviews.  The owner was extremely attentive, and visited our table several times to ensure our satisfaction.  We ordered based on the recommendations of Yelp reviewers and were not disappointed.  Started with the creamy coconut soup - ordered it with chicken.  Delicious and spicy, with big chunks of fresh tomato, pepper, mushroom, onion, cabbage, etc.  A huge serving - five bowls, plenty for two or more to split.  Entrees massaman curry and penang curry were tasty.  Ordered one mild and one hot, and the hot was HOT.  Delicious.  Finished with the sticky rice and mango which was out of this world.  Not what we were expecting.  Hot, sweet rice topped with cool, ripe mango.  Great way to end.  Our only complaint was that the Thai iced tea was not as sweet as we typically have had it.  Otherwise everything was great.  Not a fancy place, just delicious nicely priced home cooking.    Worth noting that the atmosphere was a bit odd when we walked in, very quiet, and the place looked unfinished with TV cables hanging out of the wall like they had not quite completed construction.  Turns out the business was recently robbed and their TVs, laptops, cash, etc were stolen.  What a shame for this to have happened to such a nice family - please do all you can to help them by patronizing this business!"}
{"text":"Best best best! I always get the Nam Prik w/ tofu, but lately I've been trying to expand my food horizons, so I'm experimenting a bit more than usual. I got some kind of giant vegetable-filled pancake, at a \"7\" spicy level, and, my god - the flavor. The deliciousness. I can't begin to describe it.  Then, I discovered their lunch menu. It was $7 for lemondrop soup, an eggroll, and a gigantic plate of General Tso's Tofu, which was fried to PERFECTION and just gosh darn amazing.   I don't think they make bad food here. All my experiences have been A++++++++++."}
{"text":"Great lunch deal... $6-$8 for soup, spring roll and meal. Can't beat that. Panang curry was delicious! Only complaint was downstairs where the bathroom is was kind of smelly."}
{"text":"Very good!  We got the crab Rangoon, velvet seafood soup, Thai salad, pad Thai, and coconut spaghetti - a lot of food but it was so good!"}
{"text":"Used to be the place to go when I was starving, til they made me wait 30 minutes? and lost my appetite. They were busy but managed to serve two parties that got there 10-15 min after me. Problem was I got food to go and had already paid. Walked out and left my $20 donation"}
{"text":"I did a take out order, this was my first time here. The food was good and the hot is really hot. The location is small and has tables to dine in. The order was ready on time. I enjoyed it and would go back."}
{"text":"I think this place ties with Smiling Banana Leaf for good Thai food so I will compare it to that. That being said, they taste completely different. It completely blows Thai Cuisine out of the water. My wife and I enjoy the noodle dishes there, they are a little more sweet and saucy. Here, they definitely get a good wok hei flavor into the dish and the noodles come out a little on the drier side. That is a mark of better cooking technique, but sometimes you want a little ghetto chinese food vibe to your food. The curries tend to be better here in my experience. The duck curry is particularly good. I don't like the rice they use. The rice turns out a bit mushy. I prefer calrose rice with everything. The calamari and the papaya salad are delicious as well. The serving sizes are pretty good, enough for 2 meals. Regarding service, I don't think you can beat the experience at smiling banana leaf, but they are very personable and this place feels more homey, like a family business.  tl;dr - everything is great except for the white rice"}
{"text":"I hang out in Bloomfield quite a bit, but I had never heard of this place until a friend mentioned it to me and I went searching for it. Turns out I had been walking by it for weeks without noticing since the exterior is pretty plain and you can't really look through the window with all the plants and neon signage in the way. Or perhaps I'm just too short to properly peer in, but I think it has more to do with the former. Regardless, the exterior and interior are nothing fancy.  Based on my friend's rave review of the restaurant, I had high expectations but ended up finding a lot to be lacking. First off, the waitress didn't ask anyone at our table for our desired spice levels. There was not even an offer of hot sauce or a spice rack to enhance our dishes, but then again, I didn't speak up and ask for one. I just found it strange considering we had ordered Pad Thai and curries. Secondly, the food wasn't as flavorful as I expected and the noodles in my Pad Thai were a little underdone.  The other odd thing about our experience was the vegetarian option. Or should I say options? They offer vegetables OR tofu. The waitress was very confused when my friends asked for both in their entrees. Luckily, after some explaining, my friends received half and half. It's not necessarily a negative, but we had just assumed offering these options together was the norm. But you know what happens when you assume...  Rather than be a Debbie-downer, I'll end with the positives of our experience. The food arrived at our table quickly. The portions are quite large and the prices are also slightly cheaper then other competing Thai restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"After my first experience here all I can say is the restaurant interior is nice and the food was ready quickly, but that's all this place has to offer.  My girlfriend and I ordered pad thai and thai rolls.  The thai rolls should have been called chemical rolls because they tasted like they came right out of the frozen food section.  There was no taste to them except the flavor of chemicals.  The chili sauce that came with them was disgusting.  The pad thai was as bad if not worse, especially considering how tasty this dish can be.  Awful flavor and poor quality ingredients.  I would go somewhere else for pad thai or thai rolls (I can't speak for the other dishes)."}
{"text":"I stopped by the restaurant today to eat dinner around 4:30-5:00 PM.  Entered the restraunt to be seated and there was nobody in the place except two customers.  Waiting about 5 minutes to be seated and still nobody arrived.  Finally decided to leave and find somewhere else to eat.  Not sure if the food was good or not since nobody would seat us or take our order."}
{"text":"Wonderful food.  Schezuan Beef ($7) for me, avocado curry something-or-other ($8) for the girlfriend.  Very tender meat and wonderful flavors.  I love the tiny/classy atmosphere.  Always fast and tasty.  Had enough for a quick lunch with some to take home for later.  The best part is leftovers are packed in those white fold-up boxes I see on tv that restaurants rarely use :)"}
{"text":"A gem in the west valley! I was so happy to eat some good Thai food and didn't have to drive all the way to Mesa. We got the mild  Thai mango curry with tofu, the waitress made it special because we are vegan and don't do the fish sauce. It was better than good. It had enough spice too we shouldn't have gotten mild but I loved it regardless. I also got the sticky rice with mango and it was amazing. I would highly recommend going here. The service was also great, our waitress that also may have been the owner, because she said the waiter was not in, was so sweet. She should get an added star for being so nice."}
{"text":"Always incredible.  I have celiac, and they are very accommodating. Food has never made me sick, and the staff is very knowledgeable. Pad Thai is incredible, and service is always fast.  Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very friendly, family environment and comfy restaurant. I had Pad Thai dish and it was great. The decor is simple yet pleasing to the eye. The waiter was very nice and made sure I had everything I wanted. I will not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"Fresh, high quality ingredients prepared in authentic Thai sauces make this my favorite Thai restaurant in America. The food here is better than in most of Thailand. The cooking techniques are the same, but the ingredients are fresher and of better quality. Clean environment with fresh white table cloths also make it different than most restaurants in Thailand and America. They are willing to adjust the \"heat\" level, but do it in a manner that does not compromise the flavor."}
{"text":"The best in the west! Can't speak for the east side thai food but this is the bomb! Try the panang curry! Owner is super nice and the food is on point everytime! Won't regret it! Also the pricing is lower than others I've previously encountered."}
{"text":"Great prices for the portions, absolutely delicious food, and a wonderful family-owned atmosphere."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai cuisine.   I've been here twice with colleagues for lunch and highly recommend this place.  I would definitely come here more if it were closer to where I work.    Don't be deterred by the tacky sign in front--it's all about the food.  Every dish I've had here has been great so far.   You can specify the spiciness of your dishes as well.    Wonton soup ($3.00): warm, soft wontons with chicken and shrimp in chicken broth.   Tom Yum Chicken ($3.00): lemongrass, mushrooms, chili, and lime juice.  It's a Thai soup definitely worth a try.    Cashew Nuts chicken ($8.95): chicken, onions, carrots, bell peppers, water chestnuts, snow peas, and roasted chili paste.  This is more of a Chinese dish.  It's delicious nonetheless.   Red curry ($8.95): roasted duck, tomatoes, bell peppers, basil leaves and pineapple in a coconut curry sauce.  Very delicious curry that goes great with rice.    Basil Leaves Chicken ($8.95): chicken, onions, bell peppers, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, garlic & chili.  Outstanding blend of spices with vegetables and chicken.    Be sure to pay for parking!  My colleague's meter ran out by about 15 minutes, and he got a ticket."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, byob, reasonable prices.  It doesn't look like much from the outside but it is very cozy inside.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves thai."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place every time I come here. The ambiance is nice. The staff was great as well. Food was excellent. Shrimp pad thai here is one of the best I've ever eaten. . Ps. Coffee lovers check out the thai iced coffee. Ask for it to be less sweeten if u don't like too sweet of a drink. Yum!"}
{"text":"Ordered Dinner Pad Thai-very hot, and vegetable Fried Rice. (to go)  The Pad Thai was not hot at all.   The sever said he put some extra chili oil in case it wasn't hot enough, but after getting back to the hotel, there are no chili flakes, or sensation of heat in the least bit.  Portion was good, and meat was done well.    Fried Rice- Garbage.  The rice quality is awful. Soggy, clumpy.  Rice should be fluffy, with crisp to the rice from the intense heat of the wok.  They used regular peas, and those out of the can chest nuts.  I expect this out of a fast food Chinese joint, not out of a Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I Grew up in this area since I was 10 my parents and I ate here 2 to 3 times a week great owner excellent food and staff. Well parents moved to Northern California and I am  now 26 years old and still eat here 2 times a week at least haha!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, it was ok. The restaurant is sort of dimly lit. There is limited seating overall but the decorations were nice. Service was good but not great. There were only a couple people there the entire time I was eating. I got Chicken Satay and Green Curry with chicken. The satay was great, and was served on a bed of lettuce with peanut sauce and a hot chili oil. The curry was average. Not particularly spicy, and honestly didn't hold a candle to the curry I can get down the road at Lemongrass Grille.  It just tasted very bland, like spices weren't added or something. It wasn't bad, per se, just not particularly great.   3/5 because the satay was quite good, but given a choice I would go to Lemongrass."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. The server (I believe his name is Ariel or something like that) is always very welcoming and funny. I assume he's also one of the owners but I'm not sure. Also has very good cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"We visited Thai Gourmet twice in the past week. Once for lunch and once for dinner. Both times the service was very good. They were very quick and attentive. As others have mentioned, I was surprised about the decor inside. The exterior looks like a typical strip plaza pickup joint but inside it was much nicer.   The food was mostly good. The crab rangoon's were excellent. The thai rolls were good but very 'shrimpy'. The Vietnamese beef soup was good and it came in a very large portion. The governors chicken lacked flavor but the generals chicken was very good.  The lunch prices were very reasonable and the lunch period extends to 4:00. Dinner prices were fair overall.  Overall good experience and I will be back again soon."}
{"text":"SEE BUG UPDATE BELOW! Visited the establishment for the first time having met my godmother for lunch on 02/03/17. The service was friendly and attentive. I enjoyed my pad Thai while my godmother seemed happy with her vegetarian selection. Price points were average to high.   We did have one complaint however. The restaurant needs to spray for bugs. I'm not afraid of bugs and understand they can and do appear at residences and businesses alike. We had some strange looking bug crawling on the wall and then our table before it went back to the wall. It had a thin long body with antennae. We didn't see anything in our food and the server did ask if it had trespassed into our grub. The manager or owner also came over and removed the pest with a napkin. On a cold day in February one doesn't expect to see something crawling by when you're eating indoors. Also, as the saying goes about pests...when you see 1 there's usually more nearby. I couldn't tell you the last time I ate somewhere and saw a bug but I'm inclined to say I was probably eating on a deck or patio during the summer.   UPDATE 02/04/17. An Internet entomology search later revealed that bug was likely a variation of COCKROACH!! That forces an automatic 2 star deduction to take the restaurant to a 1 star score and a \"WILL NOT RETURN\" disposition!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai, at par with Thai Tamarind and Smiling Banana as three better than average Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. 3-stars because the red and green curry are sweeter than they should, and use canned sweetened pineapple that spoils fresh taste. The Duck curry and fish cakes are excellent. The summer rolls are always a delight."}
{"text":"In a suburban strip mall, the menu is extensive, but the food could have been a bit more spicy"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Authentic and sweet ( no surprise) Thai owners. Thai coconut Tom kha soup with shrimp was best we have ever had. Very flavorful with al dente vegetables. Same with panang curry with tofu. Excellent flavor and texture. Restaurant very clean, bright inside and nice simple decor. I will definitely come back. My favorite Thai restaurant in whole valley."}
{"text":"Best thai in the greater akron area.  Very good Panang."}
{"text":"Excellent food and moderately priced.  Very pleasant atmosphere.  The salt and pepper shrimp are delicious and the orange tofu...YUM!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious Pad Thai. The mango curry is also a great hit. Reasonably priced. Great mom and pop place."}
{"text":"Pittsburgh has several good Thai restaurants, but this is the best for my money.  Good for take out or dine in, with reasonable prices and very spicy food (in contrast with the rest of the asian food in town)."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Monday early evening based on proximity to my hotel and the mostly positive Yelp reviews. Pad Thai was excellent... I asked for spicy based on the previous feedback and got a pleasantly warm, medium spiced dish. Noodles were well done, chicken and shrimp was cooked perfectly, and in carry out form the dish was terrific. I also observed a couple of dishes being served to dine in customers and they seemed well appreciated. I had the Thai egg rolls as well, and they were also very good. The staff was very friendly; When you eat out for business 3 times a week, it's great to go someplace the first time and be treated like a \"Regular\". Only thumbs up on this one!"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE and ONLY place for Authentic Thai Cuisine...you've tried the rest now try the BEST!! The food is Outstanding!!! Trust me you won't regret it!! Pho chicken soup is my favorite!!! I've also have the Fresh rolls, potstickers, mango curry as well the chicken satay!!! Yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"From the reviews I thought this place was going to be great but was kind of disappointed overall. Beef and chicken were bland in the pad Thai and pad see ew. Also too spicy and a lot of onion. The egg rolls were actually very good so that's why I gave 3 instead of 2 stars. $30 for takeout for 2 I would have expected a little more."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch and was very impressed with the two appetizers I had:  spicy Thai pork with lettuce and pork potstickers. Both were highly commendable. More impressive was the staff!  Friendly as if I'd been a customer for years. When I commented about how good the pad Thai looked on the table near me, it was suggested I take some home. When ibsaid I had acted-hour drive, my friendly server (I wish I knew his name) packed all the components separately so I could reassemble them for my wife at home. It worked out great (he even substituted tofu for chicken to accommodate her vegetarian diet).  And, that too was great when I prepared it at home. I look forward to another trip to this Independence gem!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrific food and service. General Tso's tofu is out of this world, but so is every dish we have ever ordered from here. If we didn't move out of town, this place would see us every week."}
{"text":"The best Thai food in PGH, love the red curry, I ordered a 9 degree hot red curry, but it was not so spicy to me. But the food is good."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  I only have done pick up. I always walk to get it which is usually a ten minute walk. I typically leave shortly after getting off of the phone with them, and no matter how long they say it will be (15-20 minutes), it is always waiting for me. The amount of food they give you lasts several meals. I cannot recommend enough the bang for your buck in quantity and quality."}
{"text":"I don't usually like to write a review but this restaurant is very good.  So I am taking my time to say that all who like good thai good should come to thai gourmet restaurant.  This is the place to come and eat it is worth it.  Very very good foods recommended  and support small business.  And the services are good, clean and friendly. GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Upon entering, I noticed a welcoming ambiance, however it was accompanied by unfitting music, which took away from the overall authenticity of the Thai/Chinese environment. There was a wide variety of food, which many dishes were good but nothing amazing. However, the peanut and Panang sauces were to die for. Anyone planning to visit should know that they are able to bring their own alcoholic beverages, which is actually a good deal. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking for tasty Asian cuisine with appropriate prices, but nothing worthy of exceptional praise."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of dining at Thai Gourmet since 2007 but am just getting around to writing a review. I can't say enough good things about this place. The food is delicious, the portions are generous, the service is great, and the family running the place is about the nicest people around. My favorite dishes include the lotus salad, eggplant tofu, basil fried rice, Penang curry, and of course pad Thai. Honestly though, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. The best Thai food in Pittsburgh. Love, love, love this place."}
{"text":"In short, Thai Gourmet has fantastically flavorful food for a good price (for what you get). Others here have said it more eloquently than I, so I'm just here to echo their sentiments.  The take-out portions are very generous and have definitely supplied me with plentiful leftovers. One of my personal favorites is the Tom Kar soup as I'm a big fan of coconut milk, but nothing I've eaten from Thai Gourmet has disappointed me. It's absolutely some of the best Thai food I have ever had, and is highly recommended."}
{"text":"I'm always here! great place to eat. Everything on the menu is delicious, and best of all is the customer service. I find it hard to believe anyone would rate this place anything lower than 4 stars. My favorite dishes are the Volcano chicken & shrimp and the chicken red curry. Anyone looking for a new place to eat, that's your place! you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. The food is authentic, and an entree usually lasts me 3-4 meals . . . tastes amazing as leftovers. It is BYOB and has been a great place for meeting friends because it is very low-key and the service is great. We also get orders to-go, and sometimes get a treat like brownies with our order! I always recommend this restaurant to everyone who asks where to eat in the city."}
{"text":"When you have a meal that absolutely hits the spot.  I've been wanting to try this place and finally did today. I ordered the panang curry and pad Thai. Both were delicious.  I like a little spice so I ordered medium. That was PLENTY spicy for me. Next time I'll get mild. The staff was kind and helpful. I look forward to going again!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had fried dumplings with dark, rich sauce that were delicate and flavorful. We tried Pad Phrik Prow and Pad Ginger and both were great, with fresh veggies, plenty of shrimp or chicken and unique sauces. Service friendly and prompt. Will definitely come again!!"}
{"text":"if only every thai place was this good. huge portions for take-out, amazing rolls, wonderful stir-fries and curries. plus we placed a huge take-out order and it came completely accurate, with each dish labeled. a rare treat."}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet gets better with every visit. The restaurant has several amazing items on its menu that you won't find at other Thai restaurants.  On my last visit, I ordered mo palo, sweet and savory braised pork short ribs, and nam prik, rice noodles served with fresh lettuce and carrots with a thick curry.  The mo palo dish reminds me of Hawaiian shoyu chicken. The sauce is brothy, probably made from a mixture of soy sauce, sugar and other herbs. It is served with cooked egg (ramen style) and is delightful over rice! This was one of the best dishes I have had here at Thai Gourmet.  The nam prik was also delicious. You get 4 neatly arranged rice noodles twisted into balls. The noodles are really well complimented by the fresh vegetables and curry with which it was served. This was a great dish!  Explore Thai Gourmet's menu and don't be afraid to try new items. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My husband and I eat here at least twice a month!  We love and the food and the service is great!  You can't go wrong with the salt and pepper shrimp and the pad thai, absolutely amazing!  We have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really excellent food, huge portions, good service. Nothing not to love.  I generally either get the Red Curry or the General Tso's Tofu, both excellent."}
{"text":"My first review! That's just how great this place was...it drove me to finally sign up for a yelp account and not just read everyone else's reviews ;)  This little neighborhood gem is near my mom's house so we decided to give it a try on a whim. SO glad we did!  I had the beef pho, which was gigantic and very tasty. My mom had a stir fry dish I believe, which she said was wonderful as well.  I also had the Thai iced tea, which comes with FREE refills!! I couldn't believe it! It was very, very good. The owner even gave me a to go cup of the tea when I left :)  Which brings me to the best thing about this place. The service. It was clean, the food was served quickly, and all the employees were incredibly friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Have been looking for a good Thai place in the west valley and stumbled on this place. Decided to check it out. So glad I did. Have been coming here for the last year plus. Come here at least once a week. All the people that work there are nice. The owner is really sweet. Everything on the menu is good. Get there early for dinner because it can get crowded since it's a small place. Their spice levels are definitely not your average. Medium is really hot. So watch your spice."}
{"text":"Had the potstickers and pad see ewe. Both were amazing.  Price is awesome and portion size is great for the price.  Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last week. The people were very friendly, both the waitress and the cook who came out of the kitchen to make sure that my dish was properly spiced. I had asked for my dishes very spicy (papaya salad and tom yum soup). The cook was quite concerned that my dish wasn't too spicy and she offered to re-do it (it was very spicy and that is what I wanted) We really enjoyed our experience and the food tasted great. I took home my leftovers as well.  I got a little flushed as I was eating my food, but I thought it was the heat. When I ate my leftovers the next day, I felt it was maybe MSG rather than the spiciness giving me the 'hot flash.' I would try it again, and just ask whether they use MSG."}
{"text":"I decided to dine in on Saturday for dinner. While being seated the waitress advised us that the AC was not working. Keep in mind that we are experiencing record heat in AZ this summer.  We decided to make ours a to go order. I'm quite surprised that a restaurant would allow their AC to remain broken for at least a week and still remain open for business. Unacceptable! The food was average at best. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The service here is terrible.   The little Asian server thinks he's charming but it's actually insulting.   He has said awkward things with no attempt at humor on occasion.   I let him know that I don't appreciate it, and I just want a peaceful meal, but he is so self deluded that I think he is just certain that he will win the room.  He continued.   I'm done.   I can get mediocre overpriced Thai somewhere else!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Don't be put off by where it's located. I thought it was going to be a take-out sort of place with plastic containers but I was very surprised! Absolutely fantastic and should not be missed! Would give more stars if possible!"}
{"text":"So, I met some colleagues at the Thai Gourmet after work for dinner. This place has an extensive menu with Thai, Chinese, and Vietnamese entrees. There is a significant portion of the menu reserved for vegetarian dishes. The owner is willing to make any dish as spicy as you want it.   We ordered appetizers, which were all fried and hot out of the fryer. They were very tasty. I ordered an oolong iced tea that came out in a one liter tumbler. I didn't need a refill. There are several soups on the menu, and I asked for the chicken coconut soup. It was outstanding.  For my main course, I had the curry chicken fried rice which was spiced exactly to my liking. The serving was too large for one meal.  Now, with the food as good as I am describing, you might wonder why I am only giving two stars. Well, about 2/3 of the way through the meal, a fat, red GERMAN COCKROACH ran up the wall next to us and leaped onto the table. I didn't know those things could jump like that. It made a beeline towards my friend's plate and she freaked. I tried to smash it, but those suckers are fast. I did manage to scare it enough that it went to the underside of the table top.  After that, we kind of lost our appetites and we all felt like something was crawling on us.  If it hadn't been for the roach, I would probably rate this place 4 stars."}
{"text":"Delicious food (I recommend the Chang Mai noodles) and the friendliest staff. Huge portions too!"}
{"text":"New to the area, saw this place tucked in a strip mall.  Only been there once, will definitely be back.  My wife had a yellow curry chicken dish, medium heat, loved it.  I had the Phuket curry w/ seafood -- great.  Service was fast & friendly.  Prices reasonable."}
{"text":"I come to town about once a month, and this restaurant is close to my hotel.  I read the reviews and they seemed pretty positive, so I figured I would give it a try.   My first impression when I walked into the restaurant was how small it was.  Generally this is a good sign, but not in this case.  When I walked in, I was ignored.  I walked straight back to the counter to try to get a take out order and was never acknowledged. I asked for a take out menu, and I seemed like a bother.    Regardless, I now had a taste for Thai, and decided to wait it out.  I ordered Thai Dumplings, Lad Na, and Massaman Curry.  Remember, this was all take out.  I waited the 15 minutes, picked up my order, and headed back to my hotel.  Here is what I found.  The Thai dumplings looked different than what I am used to.  The were more yellow, than white, and they sat in a bed of coarsely chopped  cucumbers.  I bit into the first dumpling after dipping it into the provided sweet sauce, and I got a whiff of something.  Undeterred, I went in for second bite since I had not eaten all day.  Well this time I chewed and smelled and tasted.  Something was off.  I think the shrimp in the dumpling turned.  Wow.  My first experience with this restaurant, and the last.  When I have to spit food out...  Maybe I was there on a bad night.  Maybe I just ordered the one product that had been left out.  Maybe this was the last time I go back?  It certainly is."}
{"text":"Great value!! Food is excellent and prices are cheap!! Love their red curry!!!  This and Bangkok balcony are my favorite Thai places in the burgh!"}
{"text":"i've tried them all and this is the best thai food in town. the prices are reasonable considering that splitting an appetizer and an entree between 2 people is more than enough, otherwise, you've got your late night leftovers.  lunchtime there is the best deal around. i'm not a vegetarian, but i always get the tofu option when i eat here. the lunch starts you off (price included) with lemongrass or wonton soup and a springroll with sambal(?) (a spicier, more delicious version of duck sauce). i've never bothered with the wonton, because the lemongrass soup is flavorful with a definite kick to it.  if you're not too adventurous with thai food, the general tso is pretty delicious, but you might as well try something new. the curries are always spiced how you want them, unlike the lemongrass cafe's downtown, and their noodle dishes are awesome. my personal favorite is the pad kee mow. whoever decided to cook with lemongrass is a total genius.  at dinnertime, the green papaya  salad is delicious. shredded green papaya, chunks of shrimp, and a peanut sambal sauce. the appetizer sampler platter is great for sharing. hopefully, you'll still have room for the main course.  the service is friendly, casual, and all family as far as i can tell, unlike thai cuisine up the street. the decor is fresh, cute, and a little bit campy though sometimes there's a musak soundtrack on featuring simplified james blunt and celine dion. strange as that may sound, it enhances the experience."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of eating at Thai Gourmet in Stow for about 10 years and at Pad Thai in Hudson since they opened as well and this location is from the same owners.  Delicious fresh food, the hardest working people I've ever met, don't let the strip mall location sway your opinion of the quality and value for your money.  Everything we have tried at either location is wonderful, we will be trying this location tonite on our way to a concert in Cleveland.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"For me, this is the place that sets the bar for Thai food. It's where I first fell in love with green curry and the place I first tried som tum (papaya salad). I've tried nearly everything on the menu, and only found one dish that I didn't enjoy (a fish curry that I would probably enjoy now, as my palate has broadened).  When you're hungry, you can't beat their lunch specials, and the atmosphere is as real as it gets. This is a true family restaurant, run by good people.  Also, this is both a great place to have a group dinner, or to eat alone at the counter, as the service is both fast and unrushed at the same time."}
{"text":"The air has been broken for a week and the owners must believe it's not necessary for their business to be air conditioned when the heat of the day is over 108 degrees."}
{"text":"I really used to like Thai gourmet, however after my latest takeout, I feel as if the quality has diminished. I ordered spicy basil with chicken and it was just chunks of chicken with some onions and a few peppers thrown in. I expected many more vegetables as was the case when I had previously ordered a few months ago. Also, the taste was odd and did smell like the spicy basil that I was used to from here, but rather a strong smell of cooked chicken. I will definitely give Thai gourmet another chance, as they may have been having an off day, but I was rather dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious! I was unaware they are owned by the owners of Pad Thai in Hudson and Vieng's at Crocker which I love! The menu is the same minus sushi and the food was exactly the same. The entire staff was extremely friendly and for a small place the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Decidedly \"meh\". Pad Thai was bland and chicken was on the nasty side  (they did include A LOT of noodles though). Wife's drunken noodle was edible. Spice level highly variable. Might have been an off night for the cook but won't go back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Did not knock my socks off. had lunch yesterday with my son, was not the friendliest of hostesses, seemed like we were a bother. I had the \"Thai spaghetti\" and asked for it extra hot. It was very sweet and not very spicy. The shrimp were good size, but I was kind of grossed out they don't bother to de-vein the shrimp. My son had red curry with chicken and it too was sweet and not very spicy. As an appetizer we had Thai dumplings again, the menu indicated it was spicy and it did not have a hint of spice to it. They do Chinese food too, maybe better it they just stuck to one type of food and did it extremely well. Not the worst I have ever had, but would try another place before i went back."}
{"text":"I stopped by tis place while visitin families....service might be slow but it's worth the wait...the food was really good. The restaurant itself is small but very clean which I love. Overall if you want a good authentic Thai food and if you're in the area..check them out..definitely will be back that is if Im around the area."}
{"text":"I order from here all the time, excellent service and food. Food is hot so be aware I get a 4 out of 10 and it's still spicy, delicious always tho!"}
{"text":"If you order something spicy here, it comes spicy. The pumpkin curry is interesting and definitely worth a shot. Staff is very friendly and funny. They'll play with your baby while you eat."}
{"text":"There are not too many what I consider authentic Asian food in the Akron area. Thai gourmet has many food you would find in Southeast Asia with Chinese style cooking.  You can even get Pho, which is a Vietnamese Noodle Soup...great for those cold snowy days. I usually get the spicy beef noodle, which are rice noodles cooked with Thai spices, which is neat having Thai and Chinese flavored all in one dish. The price is very reasonable for a good amount of food."}
{"text":"Very happy with General Tsao tofu dish. I definitely appreciate any restaurant with a decent vegetarian selection"}
{"text":"We ordered take out. Noodles did not have enough sauce and bland. Portion sizes are big, chicken dish had big chunks and nice veggies. Just not very flavorful. Hot & sour soup was very good. I do not plan to go back."}
{"text":"I went to this locating during lunch hour ordered the Hunan Chicken and crab rangoons to go. They were super fast and the food was delicious and hot! I told all my co-workers about this little gem. Will most definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent, service was friendly and accommodating. Great for a travel pitstop when you want gourmet food and a fast pace. Wish this was where we live!"}
{"text":"Avocado Curry...sounds weird but man was it good! It was cooked to perfection. I practically licked the bowl. Perfect on the heat and my service was good."}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet is the best thai food in the city, hands down. Authentic, replete with flavors, large portions and well priced. The tofu is particularly good, cut thin, nicely fried wit a great tooth. I recommend the chang mai mee, larb gai, pad kee mow and green curry, but basically everything is great."}
{"text":"some of the best thai food around!!!  you can also bring your own wine/beer, can't beat that!!!!"}
{"text":"We were very excited to eat at this place. After 45 minutes of waiting and asking the waitress for our food, they gave us a 4-5 min quote until our food was ready. 2 minutes later a different waitress comes in to tell us that they are going to cook our food right now. No apology, no offer to discount. The waitress just asked if we still wanted the food. Horrible service'!"}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet hits the nail on the head as far as delicious, authentic, quick Thai food goes.  Usually when I'm getting Thai food it is for take-out and the portions, prices, taste, and prompt service at Thai Gourmet keep me coming back regularly.  As far as decor goes, it's quite basic and definitely not a romantic nor trendy date spot.  I typically stick to the thai curries and go back and forth between the red curry and the panang curry.  They do Spicy level 1-10 and level 3-4 is quite spicy for even an american palate that likes spicy food.  The dinner portions are enough for two people to split and the lunch special makes for a perfect lunch as it comes with an egg roll and choice of soup and is enough to eat even if you're quite hungry.  At $6.99 for the lunch special Thai Gourmet is solidly in my rotation of lunch places."}
{"text":"I thought the dishes here were flavorless and almost everything was prepared differently than every other Thai restaurant I have been to anywhere, and not in a good way.  Go a block up the street to Thai Cuisine instead."}
{"text":"Fabulous food and excellent service, friendly hostess and waitress! Would definitely visit again, and look forward to trying additional selections from the menu."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic Thai food experience, this is the place to go. The decor is not \"fancy\" like some of the trendier Thai places, however the food is amazing. The ingredients are extremely fresh. The prices are very reasonable. Portions are generous. The service is very friendly. Parking is very easy, esp. in the evening.  This restaurant is by far my favourite Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff would recommend. Only thing is it's a small place, so if you have a big family I would recommend ordering to go. We tried the Drunken noodles, egg rolls and house fried rice."}
{"text":"A strip mall style restaurant with incredibly fantastic food. We went out of our way based on others comments as we travelled through AZ on our way to LA. Well worth the stop. Yum!!! The Tom Kha Combination soup was the best ever!"}
{"text":"Being Thai I can tell you this place is really good! Just like moms cooking! Make sure you get a Thai tea with your meal!"}
{"text":"Out of 5: 2.5 - Pad See Ew: slightly dry, could use more flavor, but still enjoyable, especially when adding some spice. 3.0 - Pad Kee Mow 3.5 - Nam Prik: thick curry, the way I like it.  Though I must've gotten it without nuts last time, since I'm allergic."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh -- great service and they are not afraid to make it hot (Thai Hot), if requested. Many vegetarian options -- the food is fresh -- the flavor is nice -- and, the wait staff is friendly -- I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Quaint, really really good food. People were really nice made sure that we were happy with our orders. Would defiantly recommend to people who like thai food!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai spot in the city. I eat here regularly. Great staff, great food, great prices. I recommend their Chiang Mai Mee, Pad Kee Mao, or any of their curries. Their lemongrass soup is also unlike any place else, and you get a cup of it plus a spring roll with your lunch entree! The Thai iced tea is also great. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Excellent excellent!   We have been to a lot of Thai places,and this is now one of our favorites!"}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet is located in what was once a Domino's Pizza and if you don't like small places, take-out might be a very acceptable option for this place.  In fact, one person came in to do just that while we were dining here.  Unfortunately, they should have considered removing the counter and expanding the place.  The restaurant has 6 tables for two people and 4 for four.  It's not a tight fit; but you are going to be dining right next to your fellow customers if the place gets full  (and if anyone comes in for a take out order, they'll pretty much be walking right past your table).  That's really not a big deal; we didn't feel cramped in at all.    Now, I recently read here that the place was burglarized.  While I would not wish that even on a place I didn't like, I'm not exactly disappointed the restaurant's two TV sets are gone.  As small as this place is, I suspect two TV sets playing -- even with the sound turned off -- would have been distracting and unwelcome for most people.  Yes, it's true:  the walls ARE painted yellow and the fluorescent lighting doesn't help to dim the brightness of the walls.  For some reason, however, even though we were there at night and this just highlighted the brightness even more, it didn't bother me.  The logo on the window is another story.  They have white lettering on the window with the name of their store.  However, the \"T\" in \"Thai\" is made to look like a tree and it has an ornament hanging from it.  The problem is it looks a lot like someone being lynched.  I'm not too sure that would go over well, say, in the Deep South.  For me, it was like something out of a horror film and the only thing missing was a smiling jack-o-lantern.  It was even more obvious from a distance as we drove away.  Might wanna think about a re-design there, folks.  Some especially sensitive minorities might not find it so appealing.  As for the food, I concur with most reviewers that it's \"meh\".  That's not to say it wasn't good or appealing; just nothing to get excited about.  Yes, the Thai Tea refills are free; but remember that they cost $ 3.99 each, where most restaurants charge about $2.50, so unless you have more than one, the refill is sort of priced into the first glass.  One thing I WILL say:  portions are quite big.  In fact, one of the servers asked me, unsolicited, whether I wanted a take-out carton halfway through my meal.  Alas, she knows not what she did:  anyone who reads my reviews knows I didn't get my rotund figure by leaving food on the plate.  This time, however, I can understand why she asked:  even I had a tough time getting through the egg roll appetizer and Pad Thai.  They make no attempt to plate the food to make it look like you're getting more than you are and, indeed, they don't have to:  when they brought me my Pad Thai, it was served in what looked like a small bowl.  Very deceiving:  there was a LOT of food.  My other half had massaman curry, that looked more like soup than a curry dish; but it had a lot of meat buried in that \"soup\" and, except for it being a little too salty, was quite good.  The egg rolls were good and not overly greasy, which is frequently a problem for these thin, small, deep fried appetizers.  In conclusion, with the exception of some redecorating giving the place a little more room, this restaurant is more than acceptable for decent tasting Thai food.  The servers are young and inexperienced, but they move quickly and try very hard to ensure you're satisfied.  Prices are more than reasonable, especially for what you get..  Overall, I was happy with dinner; just not sure -- especially compared to the Royal Jasmine a short distance away ---whether it's worth the effort to drive out there.  Nevertheless, I don't hesitate to recommend the restaurant for its good service and decent food ... even with the lynched guy on the window. :-)"}
{"text":"We had been going to our favorite Thai restaurant in Goodyear for several years now.  However, upon eating at Thai Gourmet we have come to find our \"new\" favorite Thai restaurant.  The food is incredibly delicious.  The owner and staff are friendly and willing to please the customer and it is a clean establishment.  We have tried almost everything and have been pleased with all the dishes.  However, you must try the mango sticky rice. Also happy that it is very close to home. Please continue to support our local establishments."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend last week. I could not stop talking about how amazing my meal was for days later. I ordered the Chiang Mai Mee with chicken. I'm a sizeable guy, so it didn't quite fill me up, but I took the leftover curry sauce home and there was enough for a good two more bowls of rice. We also split an appetizer platter. The peanut sauce was amazing. Seriously, this was possibly the best meal I've had in Pittsburgh. For the price, the quality and amount of food was an incredible value. The staff were quiet, but friendly. Food was served in a very timely fashion. Seriously, I would return here over Smiling Banana Leaf or Pusadee's Garden any day."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food, friendly staff just like all the other reviews said. It was nice to eat some good healthy food for a change while here for spring training. We hear this is a local favorite spot for the Dodgers' players."}
{"text":"This is the best authentic thai food in town! I love their papaya salad & seafood pho it reminds me of my mom. I came from an thai home raised by a thai mother and lao father. They are the best and since my mother passed a couple years ago this place is the only one in this area that comes close to my mother's gourmet cooking.  I recommend it to all my friends and family.  I eat here at least twice a week. Food is great people are friendly and prices are affordable!"}
{"text":"The Panang curry we had tasted good, quite spicy. What I can't stand about the restaurant is their awful exhaust system. The whole place was smokey especially right after they fried something and my eyes were watery the whole time I was there until I got home. And I smelled super smokey, changing clothes didn't do anything and I had to take a shower. Maybe next time just get to-go... I'm going to get some eye drops for my stinging eyes now."}
{"text":"The service and the food are great!!! I was very happy to find a place that served excellent Pad Thai. All of the other dishes are wonderful as well. I have never had  poor service, food that wasn't generous in portion or tasteful in three years.  You have to try the shrimp puffs with the sweet and sour sauce. Don't listen to Cleveland natives about the drive. They hate driving more than five minutes for anything. It's 10 minutes from downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Some reviewers mentioned Thai Gourmet is in fact not authentic Thai. The menu states it's Chinese/ Thai. This personally didn't bother me, but maybe it's something to consider before you go. The restaurant is tiny, but it's cute and quaint. The service was just fine, and I didn't think the prices were outrageous. I ordered the wonton soup and the pineapple fried rice (vegetable.) The portions were huge; I'm pretty sure I could get 3 good meals out of it! My friend also raved about her meal.  Overall, it's a place I'd definitely try again."}
{"text":"order crab rangoon, spicy noodles, and pork fried rice from here once a week. we crave. standard ohio thai takeout.   people who cry about reviews on here and pretentious idiots hipsters. food is fine and the staff is regularly friendly."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant because of its price, not too expensive, and it has Moo Yang and papaya salad, which are quite similar to real Thai food in my hometown in Thailand. Also if you want to try some other dishes besides curry, I recommend Todd Mun, Lotus Salad, tilapia sweet chili sauce, Nam prik."}
{"text":"This place never fails me. The service is good, the food delicious and the portions generous. Wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for thai food.   The food is consistently good. The service is super fast.  The price is very reasonable. The portions are huge.  What more to say? I've recommended this place to everyone I know."}
{"text":"I visit different states almost 4 times a year, and first on my list are asian cuisines just because I am Asian. As authenticity goes, This on is pretty close from the ones I had back home. Noodles are a must try in an Asian restaurant, and they nailed it pretty good when I tried their Pad Thai and of course if you eat in an Asian restaurant or  fast food, you need to have chicken. GEN TSO'S CHICKEN will almost be everywhere.  Just to add, service was great as well and the ambience is pretty classy for its affordable price."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai Food on the west side,maybe in Phoenix? If I'm in the mood for Thai this is my go to place, wish I could eat here more often. All the food is great, prices are great, Thai tea is amazing and the staff is great and very attentive!"}
{"text":"Just had the best Thai food ever !  Freshly made and each dish had its individual flavor.  We are not talking about using the same base for each dish like other so called Thai restaurants do. The staff is friendly and very attentive, and the restaurant is spotless clean. Will definitely go back next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered from here on a whim and this is now my new favorite go-to for Thai food. The woman who took my order was super friendly and helpful and my delivery person was awesome. The food was PHENOMENAL. We ordered the pad thai, egg rolls, pot stickers, and Thai tea. So good!"}
{"text":"Good food, large portions. Spice level a little higher than what I am used to...glad I ordered a 4. It was more like a 6 in other places. But delicious! Pineapple Curry and Mussaman Curry were both really good. Nice prices, too! Will be back."}
{"text":"My son and I like Thai food and found the restaurant located close to the hotel we were staying in. We went for dinner and ordered soup and two entrees. The coconut soup was watery but had the right amount of spice. Not bad. The Green curry we ordered was very watery as well. Have had better. However, the Siam Eggplant was way too salty. I mentioned it to the manager and just got an affirmative nod from him. Overall, average fare for the price."}
{"text":"We walked in and placed an order to go and it was ready within 10 minutes. We received excellent service from the person who took our order, including recommendations because this was our first time here, and we were also checked in upon by other staff members who saw us waiting. Our food was delicious, packed with flavor, well balanced, perfectly salted, and had huge portion sizes! The vegetable avocado curry was especially delicious. Next time around we will order in, the interior is very mellow, well decorated and welcoming. We are very satisfied and will be back again!"}
{"text":"Small, but nicely decorated and located in a strip mall.  I enjoyed the fried tofu,  although I prefer it a little more firm.  The red curry was delicious, and I should have had them make it a little more spicy.  If I am ever back here I will.   The whole experience was ruined for me,  however, by a young lady who talked about herself incessantly, at a volume that, especially in this intimate setting, was obnoxious.   Oh, and the Thai coffee was average."}
{"text":"we have only gotten take-out here, but we always get the pad thai (amazing) and the red curry (so great).  and fast!  give them a ring then leave the house (2 miles) to pick it up.  always ready and hot."}
{"text":"I love this place. Nice people and good food. Best Thai in PGH."}
{"text":"When trying to meet up with six in Stow one November Sunday, it was suggested that, \"we go to that Thai restaurant you often get takeout from and recommend so highly?\" That was the beginning of the end.  Six people - one table.  Our male teenage server sincerely needs to learn table service.  He CLEARLY had never been trained.  He never took a drink order, though poured us all water.  Had to ask him to take our appetizer and dinner order.  Appetizers arrived without plates nor any utensil to get appetizers or sauce from within boat dish.  Retained those from server station ourselves for he disappeared.  Each of ALL six meals came out one dish at a time, with long periods of time between each dish arrival.  It was painful.  Then after the last entree finally arrived, he came out carrying a stack of six rice vessels up his body that he proceeded to deal out, like cards. Never saw him again till we snagged him to get our bill. Did notice that the bulk of their business was take out.  The disturbing part was the gnats, or fruit flies, that came swarming out with every dish then lingered around our plates....in November.  Left us all wondering about that kitchen. One of our guests turns to me outside the door to say, \"Promise me that you will NEVER eat there again.\"  Yeah that isn't happening."}
{"text":"They make the best Tom Kah soup in town.  I've had them all...this place is the best.  Trust me.  I know."}
{"text":"I stopped here for dinner the other night.  Since I am watching my carb intake, I opted not to \"audition them\" with their Pad Thai.  I chose a dish I have never had before called Laab.  It's a cold meat salad with mint, finely chopped red onions, cilantro, and lemongrass.  I chose the chicken.  The meat is finely minced.  The dish was extremely aromatic and flavorful.  You have the choice of Mild, Medium, Hot, and Thai Hot.  I chose Medium.  I like it hot, but it was right on the edge of  what I can eat and enjoy it.  Thank god I didn't choose Hot!  It was about 5:30 PM and I was the only customer for about 15 minutes.  Friendly service.  There are only about 12 tables, so I recommend eating there early."}
{"text":"We got takeout for the first time this weekend, and the food definitely suffers.  My noodles were all glued together in a big lump.  I will probably be reluctant to get food to-go from here again.  It's definitely much better in the restaurant.    If you've only experienced this place as take-out, it would be worthwhile to try it again for dine-in.  I am keeping the 4 stars just because I love the hot and sour soup so much."}
{"text":"We arrived for lunch a little before 1:00, were seated immediately at the one vacant booth. Interesting and extensive menu with moderate prices. Lots of starters (which I may order next time instead of full meal). We both had Thai dishes and enjoyed them. Service was prompt and friendly, waitstaff checked back to see that we were satisfied. Checks (separate, as requested) came promptly.  The restaurant is small, not-quite-dimly lit, and attractively decorated with Southeast Asian accessories. We'll definitely go back -- I need to experience more of the menu's assortment of carnivore, vegetarian, and vegan dishes. Except for the tofu (which I can't eat), everything looked and sounded good!"}
{"text":"Great food and service! Definitely call ahead of you have allergies or dietary restrictions, or if you want gai yang!"}
{"text":"We enjoy Thai food and have explored several restaurants on the West side. This place is our favorite. It's in a strip mall and easily overlooked. Very small place, quiet, soft lighting, tasteful decor - perfect for a date. The food is consistently good and FRESH. The Spicy Shrimp Curry served with white or brown rice is my favorite entree because the shrimp are cooked perfectly. The hot tea is brought to the table in the cut,not served from a stainless steel pot. The waiters are old school. Polite and attentive without hovering. Definitely on our top ten list of favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've ever had! AND PHO!!! I had the mango curry and boyfriend had Beef/shrimp Pho. Both DELISH! Service was A+++ too! Definitely will be back! :)"}
{"text":"Delicious and large portions! Great for date night or just relaxing night. Teens and adults will love this place!"}
{"text":"Really good selection of food to choose from ranging from soup, salad, stir fry, noodles, fried rice. Their website and their menu says they're closed on Mondays, but my friends and I were there on Memorial Day which was on a Monday (maybe they made an exception for this holiday). We got there around 330pm and it wasn't busy at all. Service was fast and they were super friendly. Food was Amazing, I had their Massaman curry with chicken and it was soo good. With this one you can ask for no spice, mild, hot, and thai hot. I got mine in no spice since I don't like spicy at all and dare not asked what thai hot is about lol. Come here for some yummy thai food!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and the portions are generous. Beware if you modify your order though- it comes out wrong more often than not. Still, if you're going to order straight off the menu, it's the best Thai place in Bloomfield."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out from here twice. The same thing both times: Pad Thai and Thai rolls. The first time the food was AMAZING. The Pad Thai had so much flavor and the rolls were crispy and delicious. The second time I feel like the food was left over or rushed. The rolls weren't crisp but they still tasted good. The Pad Thai, however, had no flavor at all. It didn't taste any better than mall food. And as I got into the areas where there was egg I discovered a large amount of egg shells. I ended up just throwing it away. Overall I gave it three stars because I know they can do better. But I won't be returning."}
{"text":"How unfortunate that the owner hasn't figured out how to include credit card fee into prices. Be aware that you will be asked of it's ok to charge .75 for the card transaction. \"No it's not ok. I just spent $30 for dinner and now you want to charge this?\"  Response is \"yes our machine charges per transaction.\"  My response is \"where's the signage for that?\"  Waitress says oh it's on that sheet on the wall. I said I'm sitting on he other side of the restaurant. So even though I protested this, it gets charged. Then why ask if it's ok? I can't believe the owner expects their patrons to read obscure signage. If the charge is that important, put it on the menu. Or hire an accountant to help you with how to price your food to include overhead.  On another note, the menu does not list drinks. So again it's a mystery on how much Thai tea costs.   As for the food, it was ok. The potstickers could have been cooked a bit longer. The mango and massam curry bowls were fairly fresh.  Tables were dirty. Windows were filthy. Maybe with the .75 the owner can buy some windex at the dollar store.   The waitress worked hard to wait on tables. Having to walk around half the restaurant because there is not a pass thru at the counter was unpleasant to watch.   There are plenty of other Thai restaurants around without the issues."}
{"text":"Food was good overall! Clean and server was attentive and excellent! The atmosphere was nice and we really enjoyed all the dishes."}
{"text":"Delicious food, affordable prices, friendly staff. This is my new favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Food is always decent and there's never a wait. In Stow, there aren't many options as far as food, so this is good when you're trying to eat quick and local. One time I went there were fruit flies all over the restaurant, at first I wrote it off as being the summer, but it became kind of disgusting. Flies were flying around every table, around the food..it only made me wonder what the kitchen was like...I don't even want to think about it!"}
{"text":"First off I agree with other yelpers of thai descent that this is more of a chinese restaurant than Thai. I went there for a late lunch and we were the first people in the place. The service was great our waiter was very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately the food wasn't so good. Started off with satay chicken and it came out deep fried, really! I have been to more than my fair share of thai restaurants from California and beyond and have never had satay deep fried. On to our meals. After this I had my doubts about the kitchens ability to make authentic thai dishes so I ordered Kung pao chicken. It came out drowning in sauce and had a sour after taste while not totally offensive it was a bit weird. My friend ordered the house special fried rice. We both agreed that the rice came out too mushy and loaded with salt. Now I don't know if they use MSG, but an hour after I ate I started to get one of those classic headaches that I am prone to getting from it. A much better and more authentic thai restaurant in the area is \"Charm thai\" only a few miles south. There you won't find anything deep fried."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to dine with my dad when he swings by Independence for a lunch date. It is close to many offices and the food is spectacular. They make everything to order, so if you have any special requests (food allergies, extra spicy, mild) they are more than willing to accommodate.   It isn't as speedy as running through chipotle, or as cheap, but the food is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food. The place is small and has maybe 6-8 tables of varying sizes. I went with my roommate and we ordered the fresh rolls, pot stickers and crispy tofu for appetizers. For dinner we ordered green curry with extra side of rice, and rice noodle soup. They do put in a lot meat! They got 4 stars instead of five because the service was lacking. I ordered Thai tea and the server forgot about it until she heard me mention it after we finished our appetizers. We also had to ask for water refills regularly. At first it was full, but as people cleared out, we weren't getting any better attention. The food was good enough to keep high stars."}
{"text":"My partner and I have been coming here for years.  We also bring friends along who are either Thai food lovers or just adventurous.  The atmosphere is eclectic and the crowds are casual.  The staff is personable, cheerful and smiling.  They are willing to make suggestions as well as modify a dish to your liking.  The spice scale goes from non-existent at 0 to a scorching 10. The food is fresh, individually made, service is quick and server attentiveness is just right.   Water is always filled, extra rice is not a problem and I have seen many of the same customers in there for years now.   The Todd munn is a favorite; crisp and hot patties of whitefish, chili and green bean fried to perfection. Fresh rolls are fresh egg roll wrappers filled with rice, basil, carrot, and your choice of shrimp or tofu...both worth trying with the wonderful dipping sauce. The array of curries is excellent, especially the Mussuman. The noodle dishes are great with your choice of meat or sea food.   If you can't find something to enjoy at Thai Gourmet, then you really do not like Thai food."}
{"text":"Eat here once a year when I make my yearly TREK north.  See ya in two WEEKS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Good Thai food, prepared well every time I've been here.  I really enjoy the Coconut Spaghetti, which has chicken, pork, shrimp, peppers, onions, and pasta all tossed in a sweet-spicy coconut-base sauce.  It's a winner every time.  I've tried a couple other items, which have also been excellent.  The spring rolls are great, but the best appetizer I've had were the steamed dumplings (may not be called this on the menu); there were about six of them, and the sauce the covered them with was amazing - perfect blend of basil, sweet and spicy. My brother, who is far more selective in his dining choices, said it was some of the best Thai food he's had. Dude, that's saying something."}
{"text":"Oh.  My.  Goodness!!!!!!  Where to start?  I think I have found my new favorite (affordable!) family owned and run Thai restaurant.  Bea and her husband are very gracious hosts and supremely attentive to detail.  Extremely clean restaurant.  They were inspected on March 20, 2014 and they received an \"A\" rating.  Upon walking into the restaurant, my husband and I were greeted warmly and instructed to sit wherever we would like.  The waitresses were very attentive and asked us what we would like to drink.  My husband ordered a Pepsi and I had my favorite Thai tea (SO good!) made with Rooibos tea.  (Here are some of the health benefits of Rooibos and why I LOVE this tea.  http://www.theteatalk.com/rooibos-tea-health-benefits.html).  Unlimited refills for all drinks!  My husband and I started off the meal with appetizers.  We shared the pot stickers and the shrimp fresh rolls (rice paper wrapped veggies and shrimp) with peanut sauce.  The fresh rolls were just that - fresh (and delicious!).  The peanut sauce was slightly spicy, however not overpowering at all.     My husband ordered the Combination Pad Thai.  Stir-fried noodles with beef, shrimp, tofu, chicken, eggs, roasted peanuts, scallions, bean sprouts, and tamarind sauce.  He absolutely devoured his meal with nothing leftover.  (For him, that's a good sign that he loved the meal.)  I ordered the Shrimp Pineapple Curry.  Simmered red curry with shrimp, pineapple, bamboo shoots, sweet Thai basil, vegetables, and coconut milk.  Served in a large bowl with a ladle and a side of rice to spoon the curry over.  (The portion served could actually serve two people.  I ended up taking my leftovers home.  It's a toss-up of who will end up eating the leftovers since we have a 17 year old growing son who will inhale anything not nailed down in the fridge.)  For dessert, Bea brought out some Sticky Rice with sliced Mango.  Good golly Miss Molly!  If you like rice pudding - you will LOVE this dessert!  The sticky rice is simmered in coconut milk until it is nice and tender.  Plated it forms it's own sauce and when mixed with the mango, the taste is pure perfection.  ***  Lastly, I asked Bea if they give a Military Discount.  YES!  They do give a 10% discount to members of the military.  If you have a military ID, you get the discount.  ***  So, if you know anyone in the military, pass on the name of this restaurant.  They support the military and you can thank them for that support by being a customer at their restaurant.     Bea, thank you for the delicious meal.  We will be back.  :-)"}
{"text":"Great food for decent prices& the owner/service is amazing! I would recommend people to go here it may be a small place to eat but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Very presentable place, an easy safe place to take guests to in Independence with a charming dining area. However, you could do much better in terms of Cleveland thai food. The pad thai was sufficient in the spice area and noodles were cooked well, but what I love most about pad thai, the burst of so many subtle flavors on the palate, was really undetectable. The tamarind, the fish sauce, the lime finish, were all either muted or completely absent, so the dish loses its irresistibility. the tom yum soup, one of my favorite classics, had a nice tart broth, but had a really weird bitter/spoiled aftertaste.  would stick with BAC next time."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Thai carryout. The food is good and usually only ten minutes once I order. Tonights dinner, two shrimp rolls and pad thai with chicken and shrimp cost $18.00, $13 for the pad thai and $5 for the rolls. The food and service are always good."}
{"text":"well....based on a yelp review that said this place had mediocre food.... we avoided it....until.... well..... we needed veggies. BAD. the dude who gave the bad review needs to go back. the green curry was fabulously seasoned...and YES we got our veggies on. Barry busted his A** helping the entire restaurant expecting everyone to be watching the cavaliers win...... however we were dance nerds here for All Balboa Weekend.   We don't care much about sports but we DO CARE about getting great healthy food.   When we come back we will be all over this place : )"}
{"text":"My FAVORITE Thai food in the area, by far! Have always been seated right away -- service can be a little slow when they get busy, but the place is small, so just go with it. I go through random cravings for Asian/Thai food, and this place ALWAYS hits the spot. My go-to place for when people come into town. Pad thai is super tasty, have had all of the soups, the general tso's, and 3 or 4 of the curries -- all fantastic. Crab rangoons are terrific. The avocado curry is TO DIE FOR. If you have eaten your share of thai food and know the difference between good and not good, you'll love this place."}
{"text":"Eh, not such a great experience this last time.  Our server was like the absent-minded professor.  We asked for white rice and got brown rice.  I asked for Basil Chicken and got Curry Chicken with peanuts.  ?????  Food was not as good as it normally is and it came out of the kitchen WAY too fast.  That always makes me nervous..."}
{"text":"Cute place & decor. Good friendly service. The hot & sour soup was great. Had the pad Thai medium for entree- good overall, not as spicy as I would've liked and the chicken was a bit bland. Other than that the food came out quickly & it was an overall good experience. Will go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"oh dear...   The only good dish we had was the appetizer, a deep-fried roll made of shrimp (or fish?) with pork and a sour-sweet sauce. Not bad at all.  The remainder varied from ok to awful. Guess you want to know about the awful? The red curry with chicken. When chicken tastes like it has been washed in detergent, one of two things has to be true... It has been washed in detergent ... or it has not, but just tastes like! Either way, that's not good. The sauce was watery, not creamy at all, the veggies (peas and carrots) were very likely taken from a frozen pack (pre-cut). A sorry sight. and the unpleasant taste in my mouth lasted for some time after we left the restaurant.  The pasta dish was better, but not terrific.   Oh, one noteworthy feature about the place: it seems to be a magnet for Pittsburgh's hipsters. For some, this will be a plus, others may be less into hipsters sighting..."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai food in Pittsburgh! Great prices, big portions and the ladies that work the front of the house are just lovely. I've tried quite a few things on the menu and have never disliked something. It's probably a good thing I don't live closer because I would be there at least twice a week! Keep up the good work, Thai Gourmet!"}
{"text":"oops...I had left a review for the wrong restaurant!  Sorry"}
{"text":"Fairly typical Thai food regarding the items on the menu. Everything is greasy and delicious. I have gotten to know the owner a little and he makes things \"Thai hot\" for me. This guy will have you breathing fire if you want. He brought out his arsenal of hot peppers and sauces for me to choose from. If you are in the mood for great Thai food, spicy or not, this is a great find."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai measuring stick I use for all Thai places didn't stack up too high for this place (3/5 stars), but the red curry and chicken satay made up for it.  I have to admit I have a soft spot for coconut milk, making the red curry one of my favorite items at this place.  The peanut butter sauce served with the chicken satay is also very yummy."}
{"text":"When's the last time you visited a restaurant where it was obvious the people there took pride in the food and service, and enjoyed providing their customers with the experience?  You'll get it here.  Small, quaint, and obviously owner-operated by a Thai gentleman with a very engaging personality.  Delicious Pad Thai, with only excellent cuts of chicken...none of that Chinese take-out chewy stuff.  Ask for 2 drops of Satan's blood if you'd like to clear your sinuses.  Next time I'm in Cleveland (Independence) I will seek out this hidden gem again...go try it."}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet is not a \"foodie destination\".  It is not fancy, it offers nothing that you can't get at any other thai food restaurant.  BUT...WHO CARES?!?!  This is one of my favorite spots in East Pittsburgh.  Simple but great tasting thai food.  Cheap.  Great service (Let's not forget the underrated service of constantly filling up your water glass, some restaurants would be well served to be more attentive to their patrons beverage consumption habits). BYOB.  Great for groups, great for couples.  Always seemingly busy, but you can always get a seat.  It is my favorite place in Bloomfield (sorry Station).  You'll always have leftovers, which somehow taste better the next day.    The one measly complaint...the spice levels are pretty arbitrary.  A 3 is sometimes nothing, other times it will drop capsaicin all over your tastebuds to the point of submission.  Lesson learned, either go spicy all the way or not at all, you half-committed dope!  But it's almost endearing (\"Gee, i wonder how spicy a 5 will be this evening\").    Overall, this is a great place when you're not looking for quintessential asian food on a whim.  It's perfect.  IF THIS RESTAURANT WERE A MUSICIAN/BAND: Garth Brooks.  Look...I know he's not high art, but when you're in the mood for fun without pretention, there is no substitute.  Garth can really hit the spot sometimes."}
{"text":"What a great little place. Some great food and the only downfall is that it is so far from  my house and I'm going to have to drive a ways every time I eat there. The food is good enough that I will happily make the drive.  The service was great and the owner is a sweetheart who went out of her way to come out and speak to me and thank me for coming in.   Definitely my favorite Thai place and I can highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Awesome - old school Thai.  I have been going here since 1991.  Would recommend.  My favorites are the coconut chicken soup and Golden Lotus app."}
{"text":"I like this place lot. I normally come here about every couple of weeks. The place is small a cozy. The waiter is really nice. It is a bit pricey but I like the food. I recommend the sesame chicken wings as a appetizer or a whole meal. They are delicious and huge at least for chicken wings. I also always order the pad Thai it's pretty good, Hit or miss taste pretty regular. Over nice place for the area and pretty fast if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Sad to say, but this place has fallen off greatly. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. We use to eat here all the time when we lived here 10 yrs ago. The food was bad.  I had pad see ew which was so awful (bland mixed with nasty) I didn't eat more than one forkful. I put it to the edge of the table. When the teenage waitress (they're letting the kids run the place, you know) saw this discarded food, she asked if I wanted a box. When I said no and that I didn't like this dish, she just said \"ok\" and moved on. My wife's sesame tofu was slightly better, but nowhere near what it use to be.  R.I.P. Thai Gourmet, we barely knew ye."}
{"text":"The food was good, and the prices were extremely reasonable. I was surprised as the decor is more upscale than you'd expect for a $6.50 dish. Not the best thai I've had, but definitely tasty for the price - and a wide selection."}
{"text":"Great fast takeout, or nice dine in.  I usually get the salad with their great house dressing, and the *spicy peanut vegetable with brown rice.  Always great!  Ask for it hot, and you can turn down your heat, it will keep you warm for hours! Yum!"}
{"text":"I must agree with Monique and say that for this review I wish we could give half stars- because this place would be a 3.5 for me. Alas, that's not how the game works, so I have to fall on the side of 3 rather than 4. The primary reason for the 3 star is simply because I've had better Thai food in Pittsburgh. Second, I (like others have said) have hardly tasted Thai food I haven't liked, so I control my Thai food bias by using the metric of comparison to other Thai joints. Nonetheless, this is a nice place to sit and enjoy some well made food in a place that has a bunch of character. I've eaten here many times with friends, and I definitely prefer this place over Thai Cuisine right down the street. These guys do a mean curry, and the staff have always been very friendly to me. I'd recommend that people stop in if they're in the area and looking for good Thai."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was amazing. Small place, but the owner and cook were very nice people and always made sure we were receiving excellent service. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an authentic Thai/Lao cuisine."}
{"text":"Completely stuffed and I'm not even 1/3 into my Pad Thai takeout.  They even packed a surprise dessert (sweet green bean soup)!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and very friendly owner...best thai in the west valley. Excellent fresh rolls, Cashee Chicken, Tom Yum Gai, and fried rice."}
{"text":"An authentic Thai place in the middle of Avondale?! Yes please!   The panang curry is the best I've had, hands down. I've had to pay a pretty penny for good thai food, but considering the quality of the food for some hole in the wall place? This is how it's done right. I ordered it mild, but don't let the word 'mild' fool you ~ this dish has kick! The only items that can truly be mild are the noodle dishes..   They also serve fresh coconut which is DELISH~ They even cut it open for you so you can eat it, mmmmmm.. i'm salivating!  I live in an area where there is plenty Thai food, but I wish we had Thai food like this!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. We started with tea, the drink selection isn't impressive. We started off food wise with fried tofu and vegetable roll. Both were forgettable. But my friend likes them both. I ordered Spicy Garlic beef for my entree, it was so ridiculously good! The meat was so crispy and the balance of garlic and spicy was perfect. My friend got a vegetarian curry and she loved it. The server was awesome too, I would come back here. I'm already planning the meal."}
{"text":"I tried their eggrolls, pad thai, and house fried rice. All were delicious.. but what stood out to me the most, was their coconut soup! I was impressed with the presentation, and customer service was excellent! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by the quality of food at Thai Gourmet! The pumpkin curry was absolutely amazing, which it quickly became my all-time favorite Thai curry so far. I haven't yet tried a curry quite this yummy. It was such a delicious combination of savory and sweet, but it was also very comforting and perfect for the cold winter day that I stopped in. As other reviewers have mentioned, the spice level at Thai Gourmet might be slightly higher than other Thai restaurants in town. I ordered a 4 spice level and it was quite spicy, yet it was still manageable for me. If you're not big on spice, I recommend ordering a level down from your usual.   I'm really looking forward to trying other dishes here. Not only was my food delicious, but the prices were very reasonable. Definitely will be back! Hopefully my schedule will permit me to visit again sooner rather than later!"}
{"text":"Love the general tao chicken.. Spicy level 7 is preferred. It is best to eat in because the food tends to be a bit soggy when it's a pickup order. That's probably because of the container lid being closed."}
{"text":"I was a bit wary of the Pan-Asian menu, but the Thai choices on it are actually good. I went for one of my favorites on the first go, Massaman Curry, and it delivered deliciousness. They have some dishes I have never seen before (and I'm from Seattle, check it, we got Asians), so I went with one of those curries on my second time. It wasn't as good as I would have hoped. But, it tasted yummy cold the next day. Some foods are like that. I can't vouch for any of the non-Thai entrées, so take them on at your own risk.  The place isn't huge, but wow, the interior is surprisingly nice. You really don't see it coming.  Two gripes: 1. The ingredients in the curries aren't the typical ones (since when is bamboo in yellow curry?).  2. The Pad Thai, which my friend ordered on two occasions, only comes with the choice of shrimp and chicken (why can't you let people choose one or the other, or tofu for that matter? Very atypical). She detests shrimp and asked them to make it without, but I guess the cooks were on auto pilot, because both times they failed to do so."}
{"text":"Recently tried Thai Gourmet for dinner and enjoyed it so much we went again the following evening.  Everything we had was delicious including Green Curry and Massaman Curry, but it's the Mango Curry that I can't stop thinking about.  Service was very friendly and we will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Traveling in the area, we looked to Yelp of course for a suggestion. Yelp, you did good for this restaurant!  We had the egg rolls (fried spring roll), chicken satay and Tom Kar soup as appetizers. I have to say the soup was wonderful!  Have to agree with Amy H, the pad thai is now a front runner for my favorites. The portion was very large, so definitely go family style next time to share  among the group. Definitely going to return when I'm back in town. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I've had a lot of pho, and I have to say that the pho here is the best I've EVER had! My husband had the volcano beef and that was also delicious but I will continue coming here for the shrimp pho for sure. The customer service was also great, the server was very knowledgeable of the menu and was super friendly. We had the mango sticky rice for dessert and let me tell you, that is a must have! So good!"}
{"text":"In my opinion, Thai Gourmet has the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  Being Southeast Asian, I've had quite a bit of Thai food, authentic and not.  Their food is authentic, and they say it is also family owned.  I have only came for the $10ish lunch special.  I don't know a better deal than that!  My go-to choices are the Red Curry with chicken (spice level 7) or the Pad Z-Ew with beef (spice level 5).  They give plenty of food and I usually have leftovers at the end.  I'm never disappointed, whether it be the food or the service.  The outside appearance of this place isn't the greatest, but don't be shy.  Thai Gourmet is nicely decorated inside, and the food is surely going to keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Not the beat Thai food that I have had. I got the Pad Kee Mao, but it wasn't flavorful at all. The sauce tasted like it was out of a packet and the dish was $9.49 and it was a super small portion."}
{"text":"Visited her today, and in my opinion it was just okay. I ordered a noodle dish, that was swimming in sweet sauce, and I am positive they use msg. In my opinion, the quality is just not here. Will not revisit."}
{"text":"Always had great service when we go here. Thai tea is great! The volcano chicken is pretty spicy but it is delicious. Everything you get is fantastic. Sweet and sour chicken and pad Thai are our favorites."}
{"text":"This is a decent attempt to turn your classic chinese strip mall joint into a respectable place. Decor is relaxing, food is good, service friendly, allows BYOB, and prices are fair. I recommend bringing a date here for a simple night out."}
{"text":"More flavor than a Muay Thai kick in the mouth! No better way to beat the heat than a Thai iced tea and some spicy ass noodles! I hit up the drunken ones with shrimp and ordered it hot. The brave might want to try the Thai hot but you better have a high tolerance for heat!"}
{"text":"There are only four things you need to eat at a Thai restaurant to know how it compares against all other Thai restaurants:   1)  Thai iced tea;  2)  Massaman curry;  3)  Red curry;  4)  Pad Thai.    All else is dross.  These dishes will tell you all you need to know.  And so when we stumbled across Thai Gourmet on our way back from the Ravenna balloon-launching spectacle, we ate what we could.    The good news is that the food was pretty good overall.  There were some odd bits, but we liked it quite a bit.    THE ICED TEA.   A generous glass, I thought I detected a weird stale note at the back of the palate, but my wife didn't.  She thought it was yummy; I couldn't get past the weird taste, but it wasn't enough to send it back.  It was a three-star iced tea.    THE RED CURRY.  I can't stand the stuff, but my wife loves it.  She said it was hot without being overpowering, and the great news is that the ingredients were all wicked fresh.  The chicken was top-notch, the vegetables were crisp, and the taste was solid.    THE MASSAMAN CURRY.   This was a weird blend, because it was spicier than most Massaman curries I've had, but less flavorful.  It wasn't hot per se, but generally massaman curry has a lot of peanut notes and other complex dishes, whereas this was pretty one-note - you got your blast of flavor up-front, and then a pleasant blast of heat at the end of it.    I wasn't sure what to make of it, because it wasn't what I was used to, but I still adored it.  Plus, the sweet potatos and regular potatos were fresh, not the usual overcooked sogstravaganzas you find in most places, and it was light on finely-slivered onions instead of just dumping huge slices into your dish.  Plus, did I mention the chicken was amazing white meat quality?    OH, AND.... Though it's not on The Official List, the crab rangoons were perhaps the best we've ever had.  There was actual cream cheese inside, which made it very sweet (generally you get some long-curdled version), and there was a hot/sweet sauce that made it sing.  I could have just ordered those.    OVERALL If it was on our side of town, we'd go back fairly often.  Recommended."}
{"text":"Still bummed about them not having lunch specials. I really enjoy their red curry though. The meat is good quality (still hit or miss on how much is included) and he sauce is delicious. The bamboo shoots are always cooked through and not left hard which I appreciate! The tom yum soup was not great though. Too spicy (ordered medium) and lemon-grassy for my taste. Will still come for curry though."}
{"text":"Yes!  Another BYOB in the city!   This spot has recently under went a much needed spruce up.  We sat in the back (purple) room for a larger party for my friends bday.  The space was a bit tight but the staff with friendly even though we were kinda in their way the whole night.   I am a sucker for green curry.  Its normally the only thing I ever get at thai restaurants.  I am by no means a thai expert but possibly a green curry expert.  I am like bummed because I am 99.9% sure I order shrimp but I got chicken and was too hungry to care.  It was delish tho! I also like that I can talk myself into the dish being mildly healthy because I can get brown rice. ha.   Pros: Affordable. BYOB. Friendly service. Great flavors.   Cons: Parking can be a pain.  The restaurant is tight. Got the wrong food- kinda, but it was still good. haha.   Overall:  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I love their Pad Thai, but I usually go with the Avocado Chicken. I don't think it's on the menu, but it definitely worth trying! Their Thai Rolls are their best appetizer and the Crab Rangoon is also good. I go here for lunch about twice a month and maybe once a moth for dinner. I'm always satisfied and happy with my meal. Great prices, too!"}
{"text":"I've heard of this new place an decided to try it. Mom and I got a bit lost, since it's a bit hidden (on the south side of the smoke shop). Awesome authentic Thai food near home, finally!!! You've gotta try the Chicken Satay. The chicken literally melts in your mouth and their peanut sauce is outstanding. I had their Massaman curry and it was incredible. Mom had drunken noodles and dad had Pad Thai noodles. That was delish too. At the end make sure to satisfy your sweet tooth with either a Thai iced tea, Thai iced tea boba, or a Thai iced coffee. Very refreshing, very friendly owners and staff, and definitely worth the bit of a scavenger hunt. We'll be regulars :)"}
{"text":"As far as I am concerned, this is the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  Inexpensive and good friendly service.  The family that owns this restaurant are really some of the nicest people you will ever meet.  More often than not, they will add a free desert or small treat to my take out order.  I love spice food, and when I ask for a level 8 of spiciness, I get level 8.  At most other Thai restaurants, I get a 4 no matter what I ask for.  If you like spicy food too, then I'm sure you will appreciate that.   If you dine there, I admit that the atmosphere is nothing to write home about.  I'd describe it as a hole in the wall, but in a good way.  Not fancy or pretentious by any means. Then again, at this price point, you really shouldn't expect too much."}
{"text":"I'm giving three stars because the food is great and honestly mistakes happen, but as a vegetarian it's pretty unfortunate to get take out and find a huge chunk of chicken in your vegetarian curry.. then return it for a replacement.. then go home and again find chicken in yet a different batch / order of vegetarian curry. I don't know man."}
{"text":"Love!!  I always get the curries and their amazing!  Always the right spiciness and good ratio of meat/veggies/broth.  Their servings are generous, too!  I like the customer service too...  I always get take out and sometimes they throw in goodies in extra goodies in my bag :)  One of my staples for sure!"}
{"text":"Service was great. Super authentic food, too. Best Thai food in the west valley for sure."}
{"text":"What a disappointment.  After reading great reviews on Yelp, gave it a shot today.  Arrived exactly at noon.  Small place with only 8 tables, we were table #6.  One waiter running frantically but always smiling.  No lunch specials, pricing was comparable to dinner menus of other local Thai places, if not on the high end.    Ordered summer rolls (or whatever they call fresh shrimp roll in unfried egg roll wrap), chicken satay, and mussamun chicken curry.    We sat and waited, waited, waited.  Watched dishes at table of 4 next to us arrive... One... At... A... Time.   They didn't know what to do, so first person had to start eating.  By the time 3rd dish came out, 4th person had to switch their order to go.  At 12:40, 40 mins after arriving, our apps came out.  Summer rolls were good, nice hint of mint and good fresh flavors.  Chicken Satay was very salty, perhaps heavy use of fish sauce in marinade?  Peanut sauce was not sweet, made with too much soy.  Meh.    Over half hour went by before the curry was out.  Flavors in this dish were very good, sauce was a bit runny but otherwise very tasty.    If I was just rating on food, would go between 3-1/2 and 4 out of 5.  But you can't have a restaurant open for lunch with just 6 tables going and take an hour and 15 minutes just to serve the food, bringing dishes out one at a time.  Better options in this market are available."}
{"text":"While the \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere isn't for everybody... the quality, authenticity, and portion sizes are. Amazing food prepared by a friendly family. Excellent service; never a bad experience in 5 years."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Whenever I am in town I always get an extra to go order. The food is great but the waiter makes this great place an awesome place. Very humorous and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"The Thai food is authentic and yummy. The service is good and the prices are the lowest I've paid for Thai. My husband and I drive from Willoughby if that tells you anything. I love love love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I had the massaman curry with chicken. I liked that the massaman curry here had tomatoes, onions, carrots, potatoes, green peppers, and onions. There were peanuts in there too. I haven't seen massaman curry with this selection of vegetables and peanuts. I found it to be a pleasant surprise. I got the hot, but it wasn't super spicy. If you like really spicy I would go with Thai hot. The service here was great. Amber was my server and it was very pleasant to interact with here. One of the owners came out to check up on me as well. If you're in the mood for Thai food and live in the west valley. I recommend you chick this place. I think it's worth the drive from Laveen for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Some of the best Thai I have had in the Valley.  Thank you Yelpers for leading me in the right direction!"}
{"text":"Where do I start? Run away!! This was my second visit. I thought I would give another try. Not making a third mistake. Frozen meat and has freezer burn. Horrible Chinese food passing off as Thai. Not Thai food. It's like saying Taco Bell is Mexican food. Not worth the money too expensive for frozen never fresh food. Highly disappointed!"}
{"text":"I almost didn't go here due to a review that said the pad thai was noodles in a pool of orange oil.  I should have listened, but there were so many positive reviews I decided to try it.  Yelpers, you let me down.    I can't speak for the other menu items, but the pad thai was the worst I've ever had, and I've had it a lot all over the US. I left half of it on my plate, which I NEVER do.  It really was a plate full of over-boiled, mushy noodles swimming in orange oil.  I also ordered the Thai iced tea which was opaque orange in color and tasted like sweet milk that had been stirred with a cigar.  The service was fine.  The place wasn't crowded when I went.  Personally, I would go to the Lebanese place a couple of doors down before I would ever go back here."}
{"text":"This place was clean as it should be since it is newly opened. The food was good but not great.  I ordered the egg rolls and the wrapper they use are the doughy kind so it is not completely crispy inside.  I love egg rolls but I will not be ordering these again if I ever go back. I also ordered the Laab which I actually liked. Please do note that they put tripe with the beef even though it is not listed on their ingredients. Lastly, I ordered the Panang curry with chicken and it did not look anything like the picture that is shown here on Yelp. The green beans was missing in action and was replaced with button mushrooms which probably explains why it was watery instead of a creamy consistency. This would really suck if I didn't like mushrooms. I'm Asian so I love white rice and their white rice were not the best considering that the white rice I buy for my home is from Thailand.  Overall, my feelings were not hurt with the $30 bill for this dinner but it did not make the list of my favorite new finds.    P.S. The owner has an awesome customer service skills and I think she will do well from what I have observed with her dealings with the other customers. Best of luck!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out as I am still searching for good Chinese food in the area.  Even though it's a Thai title place, they also have a large Chinese menu.  Took 15 minutes for someone to come up front and take my order.  Not impressed.  The interior was very nice.  Seemed pretty busy for a Monday night.  Prices seemed high (probably paying for the interior).  Ordered Sweet and Sour Shrimp.  Got home, ah, it looked authentic!  Green peppers, pinapple, onions in the sauce and lettuce!  Why lettuce?    Once I picked out the lettuce, I started to chow down.  No flavor.... :(  I'll give it one more try since the reviews are so good and the place was busy, I'll try some Thai next time.  Hopefully it won't take 15 mintues for someone to take my order."}
{"text":"Very solid Thai food - better than most that I've had.  Service is okay, and the food is excellent.  I had curry, which was among the best I've ever had, and they've got one of my Thai favorites: green papaya salad.  (Someone please let me know if this isn't actually Thai.  I never had it when I was there, but I love it.  Even if General Tso's chicken isn't Chinese, I like it, too.)  Price is good, too.  With appetizers and two entrees, two people will get out of here for around $25.  The decor's a little odd: it's a converted lunch counter with some plants and Thai tchotchkies added in."}
{"text":"Dig the ambiance, and the menu. It a huge menu and really reasonably priced. This was some of the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. There's some places that claim to be Thai - this place IS Thai.  I had one of their curry dishes, and my date had the fried rice. Both were portions were relatively large, especially considering the price. The spring rolls were fantastic too. If you're in Bloomfield or Lawrenceville, this place is definitely worth the trip."}
{"text":"Great food. Their Pad Thai is very good"}
{"text":"Requested delivery. The woman who helped me was so nice and helpful! The food btw was amazing. Definitely recommend the pad Thai"}
{"text":"This place came highly recommended and I can see why. The green curry with tofu was incredible. I went with a spice level of 7, and would bump it up to an 8 or 9 next time, but the flavor was spot on. Spring rolls were delicious. Service was quick and friendly. It's so close to my office I can see becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! It's a cute place, good atmosphere. The staff is so nice, they let us try a couple of the sauces before ordering. We both loved our dishes. Definitely great Thai food."}
{"text":"As always when I travel one of the first things I do is find the nearby Thai restaurants to where I'm staying. The pickings were slim as in one. but God is good as the one Rockside Thai Gourmet was yummy for the tummy. A had the Thai Fried rice w/chicken no veggie and spicy no surprise there.  A good proportion and though I've had spicier it was enough spice to make it nice. Not only was the spice nice the price was nice.  Though only a carry-out I felt the owner appreciated my business.   A factor that determines how good a place was on my road trips is I usually choose one to return too. On this road trip, I choose Rockside Tahi Gourmet."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I order the Pad Kee Mow with vegetables every time I go.  I crave this dish.  It's awesome.  The fried spring rolls are really good, too.  My husband and I frequent this place enough that the staff recognizes us and welcomes us when we come in.  I've been to so many other Thai restaurants in this city and I really do think this one is the best, especially when factoring in selection, taste, quantity and price.  When I order Pad Kee Mow at other places, I just end up disappointed because it's not like Thai Gourmet's."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. Thai Chicken Fried Rice, Panang Chicken Curry and Chicken Pad Seiew were all wonderful. Very quick and efficient service."}
{"text":"Came here for a Father's Day lunch. Chicken Satay appetizer was fantastic.  Had the green curry chicken Kaeng Peg,mild. Was still pretty hot,  though not unbearable.  Very yummy and very creamy. Wife had the Drunken Noodles with chicken. She really liked it for her first Thai. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Best yellow curry ever!!!! And pad Thai heavenly! place is authentic, little whole in the wall. Chef was super nice and staff very courteous."}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet has really great food.  Be careful - they aren't afraid to make it spicy. Staff is always nice."}
{"text":"1 star for not being open at 10:30pm for a pick-up order on a Saturday night of all nights, despite an 11pm closing time as stated on Yelp."}
{"text":"This is a cute small place. I have been here 2 times and never been let down. The service is wonderful. Owner is very genuine. I will definitely be coming back! I recommend this to everyone. Help support the small businesses:)"}
{"text":"Loved their Thai tea! So delish! Food was awesome and the owner was super nice. Had the chicken with panang curry sauce and the coconut soup.  Also had their mango sticky rice for dessert. So yum!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I always get the mango curry. Yum! They are always prompt and have my to-go order ready within 15 mins."}
{"text":"Excellent service and the mango chicken was delicious.   My wife had the Pad Thai and wonton soup very good.  Neither is us could finish, will have leftovers for tomorrow."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place other than they provide delicious, authentic Thai food and at a portion that can last over three meals! Service was fast, dinner was cheap. I don't look twice at other Thai restaurants in PGH"}
{"text":"Finding good thai food is tough if you're not in a major city, so I went into this place with lowered expectations. Still, I was disappointed.   I ordered crab rangoon as an appetizer which had almost no filling. Also, I know this is a common issue, but crab rangoon is supposed to have crab in it, not just cream cheese.   I ordered pad thai with chicken as an entree. The chicken was bland, and the sauce didn't have the spicy, salty, sweet, nutty complexity that I've come to love from eating good pad thai. In fact, it was bland just like the chicken. What a bummer. If you can't get pad thai right I'm certainly not going to come back to try the curries.   The extra star is for the service. Our server was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"LOVE Thai Gourmet. I've lived in Bloomfield for 3 years and have never even tried Thai Cuisine because I would never stray from my beloved Thai Gourmet. Their prices are great, and each entree can be stretched into two or even three meals. When you order to-go, they sometimes throw in a surprise little treat which is always delicious.   The service is great in the restaurant. Very quick and your water glass will never even get close to empty. The decor inside is a little eclectic, but that's part of the charm.   The only word of caution I would provide is that the spice level can be a little inconsistent sometimes...unless last just my tolerance. Err on the side of caution and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"90+ reviews have this restaurant at 4.5 stars. How?! First, the positives. The service is friendly, the place is clean and the price isn't too expensive. Now, the negatives. I had the pot stickers and pad Thai. Pot stickers had no flavor at all, and they soaked up the oil. If these are made in-house, then please season the filling. If they're bought frozen, find a new vendor. The pad Thai was the big disappointment. Plenty of fish sauce, plenty of soy sauce drowning the chewy noodles and you can't taste anything else. Some fresh ingredients could've saved this otherwise, ordinary dish."}
{"text":"I like family owned authentic restaurants just like the next Yelper, but I'm not sure why this restaurant gets five stars.   Sure, the portions are huge (our chicken stay  appetizer had six large pieces: probably close to a whole chicken breast) but there's more to a restaurant than that.   I ordered the chicken Pad Kee Mow (per their menu: stirred flat noodle with chili, bell peppers, snow peas, basil leaves, tomatoes with brown sauce). It was spicy and it was plentiful. My friend ordered the Pad See Ew (Stirred fried big flat rice noodle with egg. broccoli, and chicken in sweet light soy sauce). Both were fine, but definitely not close to the best thai I've ever tasted. We had two full take-home boxes.  One star knocked off for the service. The waitresses (one which was the restaurant owners' daughter i'm sure) could not even smile, and rushed us to finish our appetizers so that they could bring the main dishes to us. They repeatedly tried to our plates away as we were still \"working on them\" and seemed annoyed about it.  Would I go again? Sure, but only for take out. huge portions, decent prices, so-so service.  Note: the menu is available here: http://www.campusfood.com/restaurant.asp?campusid=15&mlid=32690"}
{"text":"My family and I went here and were not pleased. First we ordered the Thai rolls great. Then are main dishes came. We ordered the Basil Beef, which was fantastic! The Pad See Ew Chicken and Chicken Fried Rice which was horrible. The chicken was not fresh at all. Had to be a day or so old; that was reheated. Biting into a rubbery piece of chicken DISGUSTING! We immediately stopped eating. Then looking at the dishes it wasn't a sold piece of chicken it had strings looking at the end. When asked if we would like a take out container we said no and told them the chicken was old. The waitress looked at us like we were lying. No apologies, or getting the cook out to talk to us, or offering a discount. So this was the first time we left a restaurant without tipping. They knew exactly what they did. Luckily none of us got sick."}
{"text":"I love Thai food, and Thai Gourmet used to be my favorite place to go. We went there recently and I was so disappointed in our dish. The green curry with tofu was super sweet and watery. The tofu was bland. I don't know if they've had a change in owners or management but I'm hoping next time to get the yumminess I'm used to!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time about a week ago and it was amazing.  This place is a hidden gem to say the least.  The food is much better quality than your typical Asian cuisine here in the US, especially Ohio.   I got the Curry Chicken Fried Rice.  The Chicken meat quality was very high, and the Curry was what I have been looking for.    I am no expert, but this place is legit.  I will be back for sure, and you should try it out at least once to see if you like it."}
{"text":"Ordered volcano shrimp. Was supposed to have mixed veggies and shrimp. Mostly cabbage, 3 small sprigs of broccoli, and about 8 slivers of thin sliced carrots and sauce. Disappointed that no one came by until I was 3/4 finished with my meal to ask how it was.. I told the nice waitress that I was disappointed in the lack of vegetables. She said they usually have a variety of vegetables in that dish, and she verified that all that was remaining was a big pile of cabbsge.. she said she would mention it to the cook..   The shrimp were flavorful and the cabbage wasnt bad but I wanted veggies, not just cabbage. Also they were only taking cash.. I had to go to the bank to pay for my meal.. I won't be back.. won't recommend this based on the cheap and overpriced food.."}
{"text":"This place is great! Nice staff, clean and good food!!!! Family own restaurant. The best curry I ever had, got mango curry is the BOMB."}
{"text":"In my opinion not so good...Huge portions just don't make up for so-so food in my book. I'm always disappointed"}
{"text":"Nice enough decor inside. Servers were friendly and helpful. Food was pretty tasty. Why 2 stars? After having dinner here the other night, woke up about 1:00am with terrible stomach cramps, and spent the next six hours being BFFs with my toilet. Thanks Thai Gourmet. Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent Pad Thai! Don't let the location fool you! It is in a strip mall, next to a \"Marc's\" and with a sports bar on the other side. Kind of hard to find, as their sign is down for some minor repairs. We went on a Saturday night and had no issues getting a table. It is a fairly small restaurant, but stayed busy throughout our dinner. They have a sister retaurant in Hudson that is larger (and noisier).  Back to the food, the Pad Thai is excellent, one of the best I've ever had, with a delightfull sauce and plentifull noodles, with lots of tasty shrimp and chicken. I would say that it's a bit much for one serving, and we will share next time as the appetizers were yummy! I would recommend the \"Bamboo Shrimp\" appetizer as one gets four large shrimp, wrapped in a crispy shell (bamboo??) and is accompanied with a tasty dipping sauce. Wine list is limited, but the red and white selections, by the glass, are more than adequate. Service was excellent, and the prices are really good. Will be back to explore more of the menu!!"}
{"text":"First time here. Will def be coming back! We started off with the fresh rolls which had tons of flavor with simple ingredients. It was indeed fresh. For our entree we ordered the Kaeng Pegg & the Massaman Curry. Both red & mild. It was just enough spice for both of us! Creamy and delicious. If your in Avondale stop by!"}
{"text":"So this is not the best Thai food I have ever eaten. It is still great, though! I came here for lunch and got curry, with lemongrass soup and a spring roll. For the cheap price, the portion and quality was great!   Because it happens to share a street with Thai Cuisine, there are inevitable comparisons. I've eaten at both places but I've been to TC more times and have tried a greater variety of dishes. They're both good options, but I prefer Thai Gourmet's curry to that of Thai Cuisine, which always seemed far too watery. Plus, TG has that cheap lunch special. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and fresh. Add the amazing customer service and this place is a winner. Its a far drive from my house but i think im willing to make the drive. We ordered 3 curries and chicken satay. Curries were red(hot), panang(medium) and massamam(hot) all with chicken. The winner was definitely the massamam, which is an Indian influence curry, so you will get mild flavor of Indian curry mixed with thai curry flavors. Panang was also tasty and not too sweet like other places tend to make it. What i loved about the curries was that they were packed with vegetables and chicken. The chicken satay came with peanut sauce and a sweet cucumber salad. Chicken was cooked perfectly. The other thing i loved here was the choices of hot sauce/chile. They got 4 types and the winner was the chile oil, packed with flavor and a slight crunch.   Give this place a try, warmth customer service and food will have you coming back."}
{"text":"Not busy at all on a Sunday evening! The food came out in less than 10 minutes. I had the mango stir fry! It was absolutely awesome- no complaints!! Food was hot, portions are big. Service was good too!! Will come again."}
{"text":"Lettuce wrap might be the best I've had! Pad Thai beef or chicken are bomb- ask for hot if ur a real man"}
{"text":"Very great quality Thai restaurant in the area! I came with my brother, and we've tried many Thai restaurants around the Phoenix area, but this place might have the others beat! We ordered tom yum, pad thai, mango curry, and the mango sticky rice, and I would recommend each one.  Quick break down of each item: Tom yum - ordered as medium with combination meats. It has a very great classic hot and sour flavor. Served in a container with a live fire to keep warm. Pad thai - ordered medium with tofu. It came with fresh bean sprouts, crushed peanuts, and a lemon. It had very well combined flavors of sweet, sour, and spicy, as expected. The noodle texture was perfectly al dente. Mango curry - ordered hot with beef. Although it didn't have the classic potatoes and carrots, it didn't bother me at all. The the addition of mango to the curry flavor perfectly balanced the spice and created an incredible dynamic to the flavor. I wish I had ordered thai hot for this one. Mango sticky rice - this was our dessert. Served with 2 mango halves that were not too sour nor too sweet. The textures of the warm and soft sticky rice with the cool mango were excellent. The sauce also wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.  Also, they have military discount, so that's easily a 5/5 for them! I'll be coming back soon."}
{"text":"What?!?! The food was amazing. Little spot on the west side! Who would have known!!! The Patai was insanely good. The skewers chicken sticks were fire. Then the mango cury. Game over."}
{"text":"Love the food! The atmosphere is a bit strange,  because it is located in a strip mall, but then you walk in and it is very formal,  dark lit and playing instrumental music. I always feel under dressed. But I love the food!! And the menu is very large, having soup, Chinese, vegetarian, and Thai food! My favorite is the spicy noodles with chicken. Be careful, because spicy MEANS spicy here! You can always order mild with a cup of spicy sauce on the side."}
{"text":"In short, great customer service, food was delish.  I was surprised that they had phó at a Thai restaurant though.  Nonetheless, it was pretty good.  Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places! Food is so delicious! You can't go wrong. The service is top notch! FYI it's BYOB but that's part of the fun :)"}
{"text":"I don't know why ppl don't go to this place more. They are my No.1 Thai restaurant. Cook and serve by Thai people. Last time I was there, I had duck curry. They put so much duck in the curry. Duck dishes can be very expensive,but they sell it regular curry price. Me and my husband also live their Pad see ew. No one can compete them with this. Both potion and price make them worth 5 stars from me."}
{"text":"Great staff and great takeout Thai food. My favorite is the Chicken Fried rice medium spicy."}
{"text":"This is THE BEST Thai restaurant in Pittsburgh. The quantity is great, the food is extremely delicious, it's authentic Thai taste. We have tried all the Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh and this one is the best amongst all I terms of taste and quantity."}
{"text":"This place is alright. Not the best Thai I've had but certainly not the worst. I ordered the pannam curry mild. I generally do like spice very much but wasn't feeling it that day. What came was SPICY! They offered to make a new one and suggested the yellow curry. When they brought the other order out the owner came out and apologized because she tried it as well and it was not edible. They were very nice about it and the yellow curry was good as well."}
{"text":"Best Thai in the states!!!! Doesn't get any better than here! The owners are Thai & they cook all the meals here themselves. Truly wonderful owners. Very kind people & the authentic taste of their foods is so out of this world!! They should charge much more for all their dishes... AND I'd pay more!!"}
{"text":"I love this place the pai Thai noddles is excellent. My mom took me an my girl here when we visit. We brought to bring our own wine. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in town. Love the green and red curry and the nam prik."}
{"text":"I ordered for takeout ahead of time. I was quoted 20 minutes but was happily surprised that it was ready before then. I got the chicken potstickers, which were amazing, and the chicken pinneapple curry and it was good. I order the pinneapple curry in mild but be prepared it does have a kick, wish that was toned down a little. But the jasmine rice was excellently prepared and I would definitely return for something else."}
{"text":"By far the best Thai place around!!!!  The spring rolls are delicious and fresh.  The Pho is even better than any Vietnamese place too!!!  I recommend the Panang Curry!!  The food can be spicy so make sure not to order it too hot!  I love it spicy!!  The customer service is great and the place is very clean!!!"}
{"text":"I'm happy Thai food is available in this area of Ohio. The green curry sauce was delicious and the staff are friendly! The green beans, carrots and peas in the curry dish looked like they were just thawed and heated from a bag of frozen veggies. I prefer fresh vegetables in my curry dishes. The tofu was delicious. Chili oil can be requested on the side. Chopsticks did not appear to be an option here."}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet is a solid Thai takeout place with very reasonable prices and big portions. It's at least a dollar cheaper for the Pineapple fried rice with chicken here than anywhere else I've ordered it, and the spice levels actually have a kick to them. Fried rice is my go-to fat girl order when I'm treating myself, but the veggies and grilled chicken they make look incredible as well. The spring rolls are also some of the best I've had, simply because the sauce with them has this tang and kick that's missing in the sauce from other standard Thai places. I may even try the noodle dishes here sometime instead of trekking to Shadyside for my beloved Noodlehead. Since Noodlehead is a completely different style of Thai place nothing could replace it in my mind, however I love how quick and convenient Thai Gourmet is. It's not much of a sit-down restaurant, but the service has been great whenever I've picked up and I'm sure I'd like it fine if I ever ate-in."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant to go to. I am Thai and I was raised on good Thai home cooking and believe me I am super critical when going to Thai restaurants and I am usually disappointed and always think, why did I come here when I could've made it better. But this place is so good. I mean good enough for me to bring my Thai mom aunt to try it out and they approve. Come to find out the owner is from their same home town in Thailand. No wonder I like the place the cooking is similar to my mom and aunt's Thai cooking I grew up eating."}
{"text":"Courteous and attentive service did not make up for insipid sauces, that tasted mostly of sugar and salt, covering blandly cooked protein. All four of us left food on the plate uneaten. The pad Thai noodles, in particular, were soggy and swimming in a tasteless sauce-- no flavors of fish sauce, lime, spice and sweetness like one would expect. This is not Thai food and subpar for American Asian."}
{"text":"Small place, but those are always the best.  We had the red curry and the drunken noodles. Both were amazing. We got our food \"hot\" and found it to be decently spicy. It had a good kick, but not so spicy that you can't finish your food. I think the \"Thai hot\" would've been over kill. The only sad part was there was no sticky rice! However we did come on christmas and pretty late. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There are so many good thai restaurant in the area and i probably would not go back. The taste was not the greatest but the portion value was great!   We came here on a Monday night didn't realize most place close on Monday. The thai place we were going to obviously closed on Monday otherwise I would be here. I saw it got good reviews so we decide to give it a try as we are not dressed like we are going out. So we walked in and the host welcomed us warmly and seated us right way. We ordered pai kee mow(maybe known as drunken noodle)like I always do. I've never been to Thailand so I cannnt say if it is authentic or not but this is the first time I see tomato in this dish. The chicken has weird taste too. So basically all I m trying to say is everything is great but the tase was not to my like. I see this place get pretty busy during our meal, so maybe it is good tasty to others.  If you do come here, be aware of the size, it is huge! Everything look like two servings!!"}
{"text":"Just tried it tonight based on the reviews, and I'm very happy to confirm the positive reviews:  I had pork potstickers and Siracha Chicken.  The potstickers weren't the usual fare and had a great flavor.  The Siracha chicken - generous portion, good white meat chicken, lots of veggies, and a sweet hot sauce.  The service was very good during my visit.  Not a five star - there is a little MSG in use, and I've had more authentic Thai for sure, but for a road warrior looking for some pepper, this place did great by me."}
{"text":"In from out of town and just kinda stumbled on this place. I'm very glad I did. The waiter was very helpful and hilarious, the decor is very nice and comfortable, and my main course of chicken/veg in a peanut curry sauce was truly excellent. The four stars instead of five was because of a salty won ton soup and Thai spring rolls that were a bit out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I don't think I would go out of my way to go here - but if I was in the area might stop back.  We started with the salt & pepper squid- that was outstanding! My mate got the seafood soup- very weird presentation. This huge flame that we were afraid was going to burn our eyebrows and hair off - flame was intense and not necessary, kind of seem like a circus show! I got the stir fry  - a bit too saucy but ok! Service was good and the place seemed inviting!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome! It may be a small sized restaurant but it was well worth it. The environment and the atmosphere of the Lao/Thai restaurant really comforts me. The owners and workers are very nice and welcomes you with open arms. I am Lao and they are Lao as well so they do have a secret menu. They make homemade Lao cuisine so everytime I go there, I order Lao food and it feels like I am home."}
{"text":"Two words, Yellow Curry! So super tasty and fabulous! I"}
{"text":"Had pad Thai here. Was the PERFECT amount of spicy. Food came out super quick, we were also sat right away. Prices are very reasonable. Will come again!"}
{"text":"We get take out almost every Monday night. The service is always quick and the food is to die for. The BEST take out food around. The pad tai entree is amazing!! And a new found love is the siracha chicken entree.  Amazing, amazing, amazing! Will continue to get take out here :))"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in the city. The ladies working are sweet & the food is consistently good."}
{"text":"One of the few gluten free options I can choose from within close proximity of my work (rice noodles are my go to.) Really good pad thai that is always made  with the perfect amount of spice upon request. Simple and convenient with a gigantic menu for all your Asian cravings. Always very nice and speedy service! I have eaten here/ gotten take out countless times and never had an issue."}
{"text":"Food is great! Really nice staff. I order the yellow curry combo and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop family owned place. Immediately felt welcomed which was a great start. The duck board special with chrysanthemum tea was amazing. The price was reasonable and I will definitely be back when I am back in town. I like mild Thai spice and these folks do it right. Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"The food is amazing one of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh for sure. The best part is that the spice level is great and they give you a lot of food basically enough for multiple meals which is better from a lot of the places that try to make it all classy by giving you like to grains of rice."}
{"text":"Thai gourmet was the first place I ate the day I moved to Pittsburgh. Delightful, awesome currys. I have a thai problem, wherein I eat thai at least once a week. This place assists with my addiction. I am a thai addict and I am not ashamed to admit it. Thai gourmet is within walking distance to my house and this place is seriously a frequent stop in my week. I think this place is like a step above thai cuisine, certainly there is something aesthetically more appealing about the interior that is a step above TC. This place is a bit further for me to walk, but I am willing, because the food and ambience are great.  I'm a bit panang fan here. I pretty exclusively eat currys at thai places. and TG is awesome. they also carry crab rangoon which I'm a sucker for also."}
{"text":"The customer service is wonderful. The waitress is very welcoming and friendly. They are very accommodating and gluten-free friendly. I special ordered Khai Jiao (Thai omelet) that was not on the menu, which should be in the menu :). The cook came out to ask me what ingredients I wanted in it and when I told her I'm gluten-free she made sure she showed me that she'll only use Tamari soy sauce. That was just amazing! I also ordered vegetarian rice paper rolls and the waitress made sure to give me Tamari soy sauce with sesame seeds as well. My food was delicious! Thai Gourmet will now become one of my go-to Thai restaurants in the west valley. It's nice to have a neighborhood/local establishment that do its best to make sure the customer's food is what they want. Oh, yeah, try the Thai iced tea, it's wonderful :)"}
{"text":"Best customer service and even better food! Small little family ran place that remembers your name! Pho and potstickers are to die for!"}
{"text":"OMG I love this place!!! The minute you step in you get a friendly smile, really clean tables and super attentive service, not to mention the smell of their garlic chili peppers roasting in the back. *drooling as of right now* The owner is always on HIGH ALERT (always making sure our waters are on tap cuz the meals can get fiery). I've never had a bad experience here and I will forever keep coming as long as they keep making our meals \"volcano\" spicy. :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Probably the best Thai food I've had in the valley so far. The restaurant is spotless and the food comes out at just the right time. Delicious and up to par. Portion size is very good. We tried the Chicken Panang curry and two other noodle dishes; all tasted great. Service is excellent too. Would love to go there again if it wasn't too far from our house but will definitely be going again any time I'm in the area. Avondale residents, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Once again amazing!!! Thanks again :)  Food is awesome service is authentic Thai.  We had the mango curry, sweet and sour, chicken satay, and pho! It was all really good."}
{"text":"Found some Amazing Thai food in Cleveland at Thai Gourmet. If you know My husband, he's always on the hunt for good Calamari. This joint places in the top 3! If not The Best Calamari on our list. Chicken Pad Thai  was also great. Ariel was our server who was very attentive and personable. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"tom yum soup = awesome (cures both jetlag & a cold).  good service.  good as takeout.  BYOB."}
{"text":"The food is amazing.  AMAZING.  The service was competent but could use some pointers on proper service behaviours.  Like 'don't take the customer's water glass away until they leave because they may not be done drinking that.'  Also, try smiling occasionally.  The food is reallllly good tho."}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai Place in Pittsburgh. I love curries pretty much everywhere and this place is no exception. Perhaps, not the most exquisite curry but they give you such generously sized portions. They don't skip on the meat.   They also keep on refilling your rice. When I asked to take the remaining curry and rice home, the waitressoffered to give a fresh box to go. The staff is nice.  TLDR;  you're getting your moneys worth here."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. I've been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. Authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"My family & I love Thai & Vietnamese food. We came here & saw the pho on the menu & all of us got that with extra veggies & fried tofu. It is by far the best pho we've ever had & we have tried many many restaurants across the valley. The service was great & they were very nice, just a little bit slow (probably like a 25 minute wait for pho) but for the quality of the food, we didn't mind. Overall, we'd recommend this place 100%."}
{"text":"We were out on the west side and used Yelp to find somewhere for lunch. Glad we stumbled on this hidden gem. We ordered the Chicken Satay, the Red Curry with Chicken and Beef Panang. All were delicious. We like things hot but the \"hot\" was just  a tad too hot but still very very very good.  The service was great and the owner checked on us often. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Impromptu date night lead us here.   Everything was awesome.  Service, meal, and food came out quick.   We loved our mango curry and drunken noodle"}
{"text":"I always get the Veggie Delight and it's delicious! Quick service and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am giving this place 5 stars based on Pittsburgh standards of Thai Food.   I'm from Malaysia and have tried numerous Thai places in Pittsburgh. I'm almost always disappointed, but yesterday, we had an excellent meal here! It's a very homely restaurant, family run by real Thai people. Our server was a very sweet woman.  We ordered the duck curry, green curry noodles, Thai fish cakes (finally, legit Thai fish cakes!) and Thai iced tea. Service was extremely prompt. Everything was out in 5 minutes! Oh and just to add, the portions were humongous! I swear once portion could feed two-three people (but this is not the basis for my 5 star review - I value quality and taste more than quantity). Both the curries were spice level 10, and tasted excellent! I especially liked the flavor of the duck curry. The fish cakes were as good as you get in Thailand.   This place trumps all the other Pittsburgh thai restaurants that are popular among the locals, and I really like the homey, family feel. Definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"Got takeout last night: the basil chicken in spicy sauce. Diversion from my usual spot, Thai Spice, in Westlake because I was in the area. Mistake! The flavor of the sauce was good, and the rice was cooked well, but the veggies and chicken were cooked to death. The vegetables were a soggy mess and the chicken was super rubbery. But the worst part was the indigestion that followed, you know the kind you get when you eat really cheap Chinese food? This food just has to be loaded with MSG - I was sick ALL night. I could have forgiven them for the mediocre food and maaaaybe tried something from the Thai side of the menu, but after spending the entire night rolling around in bed feeling sick to my stomach, I will most definitely pass. Avoid this place at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"Thai gourmet is my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh. The portions are generous considering the very fair pricing. Further, they will refill your rice as much as you want when you dine in during dinner. All of the curries I've had were awesome.   The general tso tofu is my favorite fried tofu, period. The sauce is amazing and the tofu is always cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Always tasty, always quality, always friendly! This is my go to Thai restaurant in the west valley, and has been for the last year (we eat Thai a lot). Staff is always super nice, and the chef will appreciate your thanks with a smile and wave! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet is a very cute, family-owned restaurant. There's lots of decorations throughout the restaurant but it's not gaudy. Overall a nice, clean space. Service is friendly and very, very fast!  Food is pretty good. I've gotten take-out a couple times and been pretty satisfied each time. The Panang curry has a nice flavor and pad thai is pretty good. Portions are pretty large.   Overall, I'm quite happy to order from this restaurant."}
{"text":"Just finished a wonderful take out order of Panang Curry from Thai Gourmet and it was great. An almost perfect dish, much like one would have in Chiang Mai or Bangkok. Could have been a bit more hot and I will request that the next time (which will be soon) I visit either for dine in or take away. If the rest of the menu is as good, then Thai Gourmet is a HIT. If you likeThai food, this is definitely a place you should try."}
{"text":"Very good and very fresh food. I've been here a few times and the dishes are excellent. The customer service is also excellent. You're missing out if you like Thai food and you don't come here. I love supporting small business owners and the owner here is very nice. Great place!"}
{"text":"We really enjoy this local thai joint.  The staff is extremely attentive and the take out is great too.  We have been here 10 times an have enjoyed it every time.  My original rating was a 4 just because I like to make certain before giving a 5.  I'm now at a 5!"}
{"text":"Wifey and I enjoyed some authentic, delicious Thai gourmet food. Would highly recommend to satisfy that Thai food craving!"}
{"text":"There are a few Thai restaurants in this area, but none better than Thai Gourmet! We ordered Chicken Satay, Pad Thai, Beef Masaman Curry, Pho, and Sticky Rice and Mango for dessert. All were absolutely wonderful and had fresh ingredients and authentic Thai flavor. The staff were very friendly, prompt and courteous. The owner personally ensured we had everything made just the way we wanted, and genuinely cared that we enjoyed our dining experience. If you like Thai food, this is the place to get it!"}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up. The waiter(girl) was nice and friendly. My chicken panang curry and chicken fried rice was awesome."}
{"text":"I work in Kent and have never been in until today. Food was really good and like ridiculously fast. Fresh, not over cooked, crisp vegetables and tasty chicken, sauce had just the right amount of spice. (siracha).  Very nice setting, not your typical \"fast food\" chinese with dragon on the wall. I thought the service might not be very good as there was only one waitress and she had 3-5 tables and  I was a single diner. She could not have been better, took order promptly, checked back, filled water, offered refill on soda, cleared dirty plate promptly. $7.95 Very pleasantly surprised. $7.95 is a very fair price."}
{"text":"More than a few people have mentioned their hesitancy to try Thai Gourmet due to it being located in a strip mall. What makes this funny is that not only is this area a white collar business district where doctors and lawyers eat lunch, but nearly everything else is this strip mall is a restaurant of some sort as well. Gone are the days when people should be afraid to eat in a strip mall as there are many high-class restaurants that hide in joints that don't look too fancy. Thai Gourmet is not exact of that high-class strip mall category but it certainly isn't a dive. The interior and ambiance are nice enough that you can take a date there and not be embarrassed or feel like you've gone too authentic.   As far as our actual dining experience.... upon walking in for the first time, I began to think twice about our choice of dining when we looked upon a ghost town. It was a prime dining hour on a weekend and not a single soul was in sight. This is generally not a good sign. However, I've had this same experience at Bac (one of my favorite restaurants in the Cleveland area) so we didn't abandon our plan.   Our server was an elderly white man who was not extremely attentive or friendly considering we were his only table to worry about. He had a strike against him as a white male in a Thai restaurant already but he otherwise may have made up for that in personality - however, he never even made the attempt.   As far as the food is concerned, my wife and I ordered the Thai Potstickers ($7) as an appetizers and then shared our main dishes which were the Green Curry  with chicken ($12) and something called Governor Chicken ($12). The Potstickers themselves were slightly odd in flavor, however, the cucumbers and sauce they were served in were delightful and I would have actually preferred it as a cucumber salad minus the potstickers. The Green Curry had very good flavor and just the right amount of heat - however, I have two minor complaints: the curry was too watery, and they used regular garden peas rather than a more Asian option like sugar peas. Normal American peas make me think of a Mormon mom's casserole, not a Thai Green Curry. The Governor Chicken was okay but tasted much like the sweet entrees you'd find at a Chinese buffet - a little too sugary and certainly not homemade.  Overally, I was moderately satisfied with our meal but probably won't make this a regular choice for dining out as it was slightly too expensive for the quality of food we got and the service was hardly inviting."}
{"text":"All the rave reviewers need to calm down!  This place is okay, not great, just okay.  Let's start with a Thai staple, Tom Kha Gai (Chicken coconut milk soup).  First off their soup has vegetables in it that I've NEVER had in any Thai soup before - very weird to have bell peppers and bok choy in this soup.  Also the absence of Kaffir Lime leaf is astounding for a Thai joint.  This is such a distinct flavor that MUST be in this soup, otherwise it's a failure - I'm sorry, lime zest doesn't cut it.  The curries are quite good.  I've had Massaman, Panang and Green.  All very good.    It's okay for a west valley Thai if you live in the area and don't want to drive far.  Otherwise, Royal Jasmine on Indian School (east of Pebble Creek), Siam Thai (51st ave and Northern) and Bangkok BBQ (T-Bird & 51st) are all superior to Thai Gourmet."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food in a simple but nicely decorated interior. The service is always very friendly. The place is clean. Love the BYOB. If you have never been careful on he spice scale. 6/10 starts to get pretty spicy and if you go up from there, you better be ready!  Overall wonderful for dine in or take out."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  The service was great, the food was delicious, and the owner is very kind!  Best Pad Thai my husband ever had. Her ordered it Laos style. I had the Pad Cashew with chicken Hot. It was hot, but enjoyable. I don't think I could do Thai Hot though!  We will be back as often as possible"}
{"text":"Great place for delicious Thai food if you work in the area. Have taken a few customers and business partners there and have never had a bad meal. Service can be a bit underwhelming at times but the food is very good. I recommend the Pataya made extra spicy for those who like a little extra kick. Dining room is small and not ideal for groups over four people. Overall great food and good value for your money."}
{"text":"It was Ok. I bit over-priced  I had the Coconut spag. and pineapple fried rice. Food was good, just about $1 dollar over-priced for the rice and dinner."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Owner is from Laos. Food is authentic and flavorful. We had 2 of the curries and the soup and it was amazing. Price is  reasonable.  If you are in the area it is a must eat. Most times I don't take the time to write so it is really that good"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant during dinner time on a Friday night. It is a small restaurant, but nicely decorated and clean. Although we ordered our food to-go, we were able to observe the ambiance of the place and felt it was warm and inviting. There were no rude or obnoxious guests during our visit. There were 5 other tables occupied, but I only saw one server. We ordered from their Chinese food menu: general tso's chicken and sweet and sour chicken. Two entrees and a crab Rangoon appetizer put us at $33, which included an upcharge for fried rice, and we felt was a bit pricey. At home, we enjoyed the entrees. The chicken was all white meat, tender and delicious. The breading was delicious. The entrees saved this place from a bad review. The crab rangoons were unimpressive and the fried rice was shameful. The fried rice was bland, mostly white rice, and tasted like a quick fried rice recipe using a bag frozen mixed vegetables. Definitely not worth the upcharge.   We will give this place another chance by dining in and eating off the Thai menu."}
{"text":"Id like to start off by saying I've been to just about all of the Thai restaurants in west Phoenix, I love Thai food. This place had great service and the food had great favor but it was very odd. I have never in my life had red curry with the veggies that this dish had. It was a bit salty, but I like salty. Also, my tofu was extra firm and fried when majority of places it is much softer and not fried, and tasted a little funny. Now to give them the benefit of the doubt the menu does say mixed veggies, so I am guessing that they use whatever they've got fresh maybe? I just was missing the carrots, I love carrots. I got tofu red curry and it was $10.99 it's not much more than what I'm used to but normally it is less than $10. It was different, not bad, just not what I was expecting. When you crave Thai food everyone has that particular dish that satisfies that craving, this one just didn't do it."}
{"text":"I ordered an order thai rolls, crab rangoon, and the governors chicken. Both the rolls and crab rangoon were delicious. My chicken couldve been a lot better. It was soggy and dry. The rice wasn't \"fried\" the way i expected. I was just white rice with veggies and egg tossed in. I will go back to try a thai dish"}
{"text":"This restaurant has decent Thai food. When I was there, I could smell the laundromat next door. Laundry detergent and Thai food smells do not go well together.  My husband works near this restaurant and goes there all the time. He loves it. maybe I just have a sensitive nose."}
{"text":"I haven't taken the time to review this amazing food yet. After last nights meal I had to. Everything we have ordered here has been a 10 and their heat levels are perfect. Last night we tried the sausages and they are something to write home about! The are filled with fresh chopped herbs then grilled!!!  Some of my other faves are the drunken noodles, mango curry and massaman curry. Almost forgot the mango sticky rice!!! Everything I have ever tried is wonderful. I prefer medium heat. It is just enough to fill your mouth then cools down."}
{"text":"First time i've tried thai food. It was amazing. So many fresh vegetables, meat was very juicy,  and the presentation was beautiful. Will be back and tell all my friends about this little hideaway."}
{"text":"Always hot, fresh, flavorful and worth our 25 minute drive. Attentive service, immaculately clean, neat, and cute even though very small and simple decor. Our favorite Thai place in the west valley. LOVE their pineapple fried rice."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for a great meal and experience. The service is always excellent. I can almost guarantee you've never met anyone as kind and funny as Ariel. He's amazing! And let's not forget about the food! So many vegan options to choose from and they hit the spot every time. Thanks to this place for always being mine and my family's go to."}
{"text":"One of places I love to go to.  They served Lao style papaya and other food off the menu that we love.  The beef jerky & sausage are pretty good here as well."}
{"text":"The search for quality Thai here in the Cleveland area never ends. Thai Gourmet is one of my favorite Thai restaurants here. So tasty and fresh! I always order the Siam tofu! Their tofu is always cooked to perfection. The hot tea that they serve is oolong, and it's a nice authentic toasty tasting tea. They also offer a homemade chili sauce, which is a great addition to any dish."}
{"text":"As Thai food are getting more popular - there's a new one popping up all over the place. This one is on top of my list along with Thai Spoon, Pusadees and Banana Leaf. However, the price is slightly cheaper compared to the others and the food portions (depending on what you get) are pretty large for the price. The noodle bowls are ginormous and equally delicious.  Not the fanciest restaurant in terms of decor but the service and food are top notch. Would definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. Delicious food and friendly service at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"The best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh.  It's always the little hole in the wall places that have the best food!  The staff were great, serivce was very fast.  We got Pad Thai, Pineapple yellow curry fried rice, red curry and green curry, all of which were AMAZING.  I used to go to Thai Cuisine, but I like this place much better.  Can't wait to go back!  Also BYOB with no corking fee...can it get better?!"}
{"text":"Our takeout was disheartening (after some good food dining-in back in February). The Pad Thai was flavorless; the chicken in the cashew chicken was overcooked;  the duck basil was greasy and had minimal spice. Not going again."}
{"text":"Great food and great service! They really make  sure you get your food in a timely fashion and fresh and delicious as possible!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and the service was prompt and pleasant.  Atmosphere has a little to be desired and though my daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, it was a bit depressing to be the only ones in there on a Saturday night during Parents Weekend at 8:15!  Summer rolls were tasty and fresh and one order was perfect for 2 ppl. (1 each as app).  Had the basil duck as my entree and it was amazing.  The duck was tender and perfectly cooked and the level 3 spice was just enough heat.  Price was just right too.  Wish I'd checked to see that it is BYOB :("}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place. I used to come here with friends for dinner. It's a family style place and the staff is super friendly and nice. I usually order their Massaman curry, Ma Po Lo, tilapia basil and the pumpkin curry. Every time that I come here, I leave satisfy and happy. Another plus is that it's a byob place and from what I remember,  they don't charge you for the glasses. We also came here a couple of times for birthdays and they were nice enough to give us plates. Recently I have been doing takeout and realized that they give you free dessert . One time we got the tapioca with coconut milk and corn which I didn't think that I would like but I definitely do now after trying it! The only downside to this place is that it doesn't look as nice as other restaurants but it doesn't bother me since the other factors outweigh that."}
{"text":"I have only had the chance to experience Thai Gourmet twice, but after those two experiences, I can simply state that my Thai cravings are now going to be spent elsewhere (despite this being the closest Thai place to where we reside).    The first time, I had the Pad See Ew, and it was good... spice level was accurate, noodles and sauce were good.  Second time, I figured I cannot go wrong with what I ordered last time, so I got it again.   I could not have been more disappointed.  Just not consistent at all.   My hubby said his Pad Thai was not anywhere near as good as many other places as well.    Spring Rolls, or as they call them here, Summer Rolls are ginormous and quite scrumptious.  I wish everything else was as tasty.    Service was quick, no wait for a table, decent food makes this place okay, but I will be going to Nicky's and the Smiling Banana Leaf before I come back here."}
{"text":"amazing home cooked and family owned!"}
{"text":"Recently discovered that I love curry, almost to a point where I obsess about getting a fix. This place has mixed reviews and I needed to try it for myself, especially since I live nearby.   Parking may be hectic due to its location in a strip mall next to Marc's. Make your way past that and you'll be pleasantly surprised by the interior. It's warm and tastefully done. You can tell they want you to relax and order as much food as you want and stay as long as you'd like, too! The service has always been fantastic- never a complaint. Our orders have always been spot on and our drinks were always full.   The first few times I had the avacado curry but then switched to the Siam curry with shrimp. Be sure to order to your spice level on any dish. I had their Pad Thai and it's pretty good. I've had a bite here & there from other parts of the menu and everything was very good. I will continue to explore the Thai dishes!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I'm actually eating leftovers as I type this review. I've been here at least10 times... Always great food at a reasonable price with good service. There is one young woman who is typically our server when we go and she is always very contentious and friendly.  I've tried the noodle dishes, fried rice, curries... all quality! My favorite is either the Thai Fried Rice with Shrimp or Pad Z-Ew, with a sweet brown sauce and thick rice noodles. Unless you are a competitive eater, you will have leftovers to take home since the portions are huge. I always have lunch for the next day (or a late night snack...)!  I stick to the non-spicy dishes, but if something says spicy, it will be spicy! I've tried bites of my boyfriend's Tom Yum soup or curry dish and my mouth was shortly on FIRE.   My only complaint is that the spice level is somewhat inconsistent. I am a huge baby when it comes to spice, so I usually do a 2-3 maximum. Sometimes it's fine, sometimes it's a little hotter than I would like. I should just stick with a one!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend pad thai ck and pad prik prow ck mild. I have been in many Thai food restaurants and thai gourmet is one of the best in the west valley. Thai gourmet it is original thai food you have to try this hole on the wall."}
{"text":"This place has a small dining area, I ordered the Pad Garlic which was to my liking. The staff is very polite. The chicken in my dish was tender it wasn't just scraps of chicken thrown in."}
{"text":"Let me warn you, Thai hot will rip you up. This food is incredible, but they take their spiciness seriously. I highly recommend that you go one step down from your normal. Coconut ice cream is delicious."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! Food was really delicious, restaurant was spotless i would def recommend this to others! Will visit again!"}
{"text":"The food was fantastic!! prices were great.  Loved it! The place could have been cleaner, The floors in the bathroom were pretty gross, maybe a bit of paint and some new tile on the floor,  It may just be an old building issue."}
{"text":"Yay!  Thai food close to home!  Today was the first day open and the food is delicious.  The staff  is wonderful and it was delightful watching everyone working to get our order just right.  The red and panang curries were delicious .  The portions ample.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The minute we walk in we felt welcomed. We went to front and ordered takeout. The guy was very funny and outgoing! While we were waiting for the food he offered us free drinks. Food was great. Soup was nice and hot plastic silverware was clean and new. I am impressed with Thai gourmet performance and quality of food keep up the good work!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in the city. It's a simple place with affordable and delicious food. The portions are big, and the wait staff is attentive. I've only ever gotten their curry dishes but they are always so good!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and always had a great experience. Tonight when I called to put in a pick-up order, their phone wasn't working. I figured I'd just drive there and put in my order in person and wait. It wasn't crowded at all. Maybe 3 tables was it. It took an hour and a half to get my food. If I hadn't already paid I would have left. Definitely left a bitter taste in my mouth towards them. But as always, food is amazing."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite restaurants but the quality has dropped precipitously. The food is no longer anything special, and the service can be downright hostile. The last two times we've eaten here, our server (older middle-aged woman wearing way too much perfume) was very rude. Most recently, she made us wait 10 minutes before she came to our table, even though we were the only ones in the restaurant!   She asked if we wanted menus (who asks that question?), then literally fewer than 3 seconds later, asked if we were ready to order. I could feel the animosity radiating from her. We tipped less than 10%, and this still was overly generous. I used to be a waiter, and have only tipped less than 20% in 2 restaurant visits - this is out of probably thousands of visits.   The food is now bland and tastes like fast food Chinese. Even the chicken coconut soup doesn't taste right, and that was their best dish.   It's a damn shame; this used to be one of my favorite restaurants. I'm guessing it was bought by somebody who simply doesn't care, and that attitude is reflected by the staff.   The good ratings here are probably remnants of old visits - I would stay far, far away from this restaurant."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I have ever met a Thai dish I didn't like so perhaps I'm not the most unbiased reviewer here, but Thai Gourmet is one of those places that makes me salivate just thinking about it.  This small little joint gives a hole-in-the-wall impression from the outside, but inside everything feels very crisp and clean.  There is a little bit of an art explosion on the walls, but I consider it a plus to get to muse about the various scenes, random portraits, etc. while enjoying my meal.  Everything I have ordered from here has always been fresh and a HUGE plus in my book is that they are incredibly consistent with their spiciness levels.  I can handle heat but nothing too extreme and I usually order a \"6\" here, but my boyfriend sometimes convinces me to kick it up a notch to a \"7\".  Neither is overwhelming, but I can almost never finish my entire meal and have learned that the heat grows as the food sits and a \"7\" makes for some mouth-numbing leftovers.  My current favorite dish on their menu is the baby bok choy in garlic sauce with shrimp, but I really think you can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  This particular dish is cooked to perfection... the bok choy leaves wilt just the right amount and soak up the sauce while the stem stays a bit \"al dente\" to create texture.  It is served with a healthy portion of shrimp and if memory serves me correctly fits the bill at around $10.  To be honest I have never paid attention to the price because 1) whatever they charged I would be willing to pay for it and 2) I'm always amazed at how little the total cost is when I have a full second portion to take home with me.  If you order takeout, they also include a delectable little brownie to go with each entree.  My ONLY gripe with them is that they sometimes go on extended vacations (like right now, for example... tried to go there last week and saw that they are closed until the end of August).  I know, everyone deserves a vacation.  But maybe they could give me some warning so I can order up a full freezer's worth of food before they go???"}
{"text":"The PANANG CURRY is amazing! It never ceases to impress. Rich in flavor and just the right amount of spice makes the dish absolutely incredible!"}
{"text":"The place is small but I love the Hot and Sour soup. It taste better than any I have had. Used to order the Pad Thai but something about has changed so I only get the soup and egg rolls. I usually call my order in for lunch. When they say 10 minutes, they mean it! The staff is pleasant. Would have given 5 stars had the dish I love not changed flavors which makes me not go there as often."}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet is a bomb spot for lunch. $6 and some change gets you a spring roll, cup of soup and an entree large enough to fill your gut three times over (note, no lunch deal on weekends). I always skip the soup (I think it's disgusting). When you do that, they give you two spring rolls (yes!). The spring rolls are usually cold and relatively hollow, but I kind-of love them anyway. The Nam Prik is my favorite entree choice, though it is among the least healthy of things I am willing to eat in this world. Greasy tempura and loads of delicious tofu served with an ultra rich spicy peanutty sauce and a sad pale side salad. The portion size is seriously gigantic. Other decent entree choices I've tried include Japanese Eggplant and the Pad Kee Mao. I usually leave here feeling like I am going to explode, with leftovers enough to revive that sensation two more times.  They *seem to be fully understanding of the vegan concept when I ask for no egg and no fish sauce.   For dinner, or on a Saturday, you pay more money for less food, meh.   Spice level of 10 is not as scary as it should be."}
{"text":"I stopped by a week ago for lunch with a friend.  We intended to stop by the new PB&J place down the street, but they're closed on Mondays, so we decided to stop by one of the two Thai restaurants on Liberty instead.  Given that the first one we passed was closed, and that this one was open, we decided to try it out.  Given that I'd never had one before, I decided to start off my meal with a Thai iced tea ($2).  If you enjoy Southern sweet tea, as I do, you'll probably enjoy the Thai version, which is topped with sweetened condensed milk.  This ended up being the best part of the meal for me, as I was underwhelmed by my order of pad kee mao (spicy basil/drunken noodles; $9).  As I've never had this dish before, it may be that I just ordered the wrong thing--I probably should have stuck to the pad Thai to be safe.  At any rate, I found the dish kind of flavorless and bland, and not to have much of a kick at all despite ordering a spice level of 4/10--I definitely wouldn't order it again.  I think this place is about middle of the road for PGH Thai cuisine.  To my palate, the quality of the food here is equivalent to Smiling Banana Leaf, but not as good as Spice Island or Nicky's, the latter of which remains my top choice for Thai cuisine in PGH.  While I wouldn't seek it out, it was good enough for lunch on a Mon. when a lot of other places are closed.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Will go back. The food is very good and taste. The Mango Curry was definitely the favorite for the evening. Nicely spiced."}
{"text":"The flyer ice was very good. Someone had a heavy hand with the soy so the food was more salty then what I like. I will come back but will ask for sauce on the side so I can regulate the flavor."}
{"text":"The downgrade is not for the food, which has not seen any change in quality as far as I know. Rather, it's for their rather arcane policy of not serving sit-in customers as early as half an hour before their posted closing time. We got there at exactly 9:30p, and though they officially close at 10p they weren't having us eat in. This wasn't the first time either; I've come here before on Friday nights at various times between 9:30 and 10 and was turned away each time. We were hoping that half an hour would have been enough, seeing as this is no dressy $$$ place, but we were sorely disappointed.  A last point--it would have been understandable if the kitchen had already closed, but we knew that not to be the case, as they still do takeout orders way past then. Having dined in multiple times before, we knew that the food takes at most 10 minutes to come out, and that half an hour, give or take 10 minutes, would have been completely sufficient for us to finish our meal from sitting down to paying the check."}
{"text":"The food was good OMG I love the Pho and the drunken noodles. It was really delicious and will be going back again."}
{"text":"Food was very good.  Wife loved the Pad Thai.  I got the Siam thai dish.  Very well seasoned.  Service was prompt.  Never let our glasses go empty.  Only negative is the cold draft on the seating area from the door.  5 Stars for carryout or summertime."}
{"text":"So I live on the Westside & was craving Thai. Typically I'd go to Thai Rama in Central Phoenix but I just wasn't up for that drive, plus I wanted to go. Thai Rama is a little more up scale & good for dining in and to be honest I didn't feel like treating anyone of my lady friends that Sunday evening. So I looked up this place & just went for it.  WOW!!!  I ordered the Shrimp Pad Thai, Chicken Fried Rice, and Chicken Mango Curry all medium spice.   Let's just say I probably won't be eating Thai anywhere else in the valley any longer.   Pure EXCELLENCE!!! Great prices!!!"}
{"text":"I was quite impressed by this place. I was thinking Thai in independence, arg what could go wrong. Well except for it being a bit pricy 16 $ for squid, the food was quite tasty.   Be prepared to spend a bit more than your average asian place in the CLE. After that the food is pretty good.  Oh and you can bring your own booze.   The service was pretty awesome, out server was a totaly funny degenerate, i could not phase him.   We came with a pretty big party and there was a small child present, they were complety accommodating.  As for the food the menu is huge, my cracker friends ordered off the Chinese menu and it was decent Americanized chinese food. I ordered  a spicy squid dish with coconut milk. It was super tasty but not very spicy, i asked for it to be nuclear, however this place seems to be Filipeno owned and them peeps from experience do not really eat or understand copious amounts of chilies. But the food was super flavorful, the service was warm and efficient, and i will be back."}
{"text":"We were the only ones in here at 9pm on a Wednesday night.  Maybe nobody eats late in Independence, OH.  Our table of 3 loved our Spicy Chicken Peanut, Szechuan veggies, & Chicken Pad Kee Mao.  Perfectly spicy & flavorful.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"Drove from Happy Valley to eat here. Yes! It's that good. Small restaurant with great food and even better service. The Pad Thai shrimp was excellent. Shrimp temperature was perfect. I ordered heat level \"hot\" and that was great. Unnecessary to order it Thai-Hot or even Laos-Hot. Very economical too. If you like Thai you'll like this."}
{"text":"We ate there last night for and the food was terrible. Maybe I wasn't lucky but the meat was not fresh at all. Honestly my fried rice tasted like a wet dirty dog( I never ate it but it was smelling like it and I could taste the same). The girl that was serving us never came to ask how the food tasted or if it was good. When she came with the bill she saw my almost all the food in my plate and asked how was the food and I said was not good and the meat was not fresh. She just said \"sorry your food was not good\". I expected she was not charging me $10 for that meal (the meat was spoiled)! Great, me and my kids had diarrhea this morning at the first day of the year because we ate a couple spoons of food! Thanks!"}
{"text":"I just had the Tom Kha soup with chicken (mild) for lunch. Amazing!  I've had a head cold for the past week and this hit the spot. Very fresh and tasty with the right amount of heat. We just moved to Glendale and we will be regulars here for sure."}
{"text":"Did I go to the wrong restaurant by mistake? I came here solely because of the reviews. I ordered two starters, and they were fine. I then ordered drunken noodles. I could not chew the beef. I tried, but it was not going to happen, it was boot leather. I took my meal to the counter and asked for something else instead. I ordered green curry with seafood. When it arrived it looked terrific. Then I noticed immediately that the curry was water thin. That was the least of my problems. The Curry was so spicy and absurdly salty that it was completely inedible. I did not know what to do. Two dishes in a row that were both inedible. I grabbed $20 threw it on the table and walked out. I have never had such bad Thai food in all my life."}
{"text":"Great pad Thai! The sauce has a strong peanut flavor.The spicy goes from 1-10 and 10 is actually extremely spicy. I gave it a 4/5 because of consistency. Some days there's not enough sauce in the pad Thai.   Chicken satay and shrimp summer rolls are also great appetizers here"}
{"text":"This place is great, the wonton soup is delicious & so is everything else. The servers are also very nice. Very nice environment also!"}
{"text":"This is quite simply the best Thai food in Pittsburgh.  I have been to all the other Thai joints in the city, and this one is the best.  The food is consistently good and cheaper than many of the other places.  The curries are nicely done.  The pad Thai is excellent (although I prefer the pad see ew).  Tom Kar soup is awesome.   Service is prompt, friendly, and efficient.  The ambiance may be a little lacking, but the food more than makes up for it.   Almost forgot to mention that it is BYOB."}
{"text":"This is my and my boyfriend's go to place when we're craving authentic Thai/Lao food. The place is run by a Thai and Lao couple who are the sweetest and genuinely happy to service their customers. I usually get papaya salad Thai hot, but it wasn't until I came here that I found out about there being a Lao hot, which the owner says its hotter and it sure is!! The larb is excellent too as you can tell that they add the toasted rice powder (which is a key ingredient to making it). It adds such a great flavor to the overall dish. Their pad thai was delicious and had a lot of flavor--not overly dry like other places. There are many places I've tried that don't add it and you can tell. Must try this place!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Good service. Relaxed atmosphere. Reasonably priced. Need to check out more of the dishes on the menu. I had the Pad Thai and my friend had the curry. We both enjoyed our meals. We also shared the chicken satay."}
{"text":"Keeping it short and simple.. Awesome food and service along with reasonable prices... Come here for lunch when in the west valley, highly recommended for authentic Thai food...."}
{"text":"My first time here, got the Tum Yum Kai (chicken) hot pot and it was delicious. Mind you, I just moved to Phoenix from a part of Los Angeles which is \"Thai Town\" so I know good Thai food when I try it. The owner was very nice and accommodating, working as quickly as possible to provide quality service. I highly recommend you give this place a try. I still need to try her other dishes, but you could usually tell the overall quality of a Thai place from the quality of their soup. I will definitely be going back to try the dozens of other dishes on the menu. Reminds me of home!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Delicious! Fresh! Am def going to come back! We started w spring roll appetizer, best rolls and biggest spring rolls I've had. Very delicious! I loved my soup"}
{"text":"My cousin and I decided to go out to eat at Thai Gourmet since we were looking really nice and she never really tried Thai before.  Thai Gourmet is a very quaint restaurant located in the plaza off of Rockside road.  As soon as we walked into the restaurant I fell in love with the décor! Also, the host/waiter told us that we looked really nice as he sat us down to eat.  They have a very extensive menu, which was good for my cousin being a Thai novice.  There were so many yummy dishes to choose from that were either Thai or Chinese cuisine. OH they also have great choices for the vegans and vegetarians of the world!  I am a flex-vegan(self-titled lol).  We decided to try out the vegetable dumpling as our starter.  And that was a great decision for us!  We both loved it!    For my main dish I ordered the Yellow Curry with Tofu.  I was so flavorful and delish that my cousin was eating out of my dish.  She now knows she LOVES yellow curry.  While we were eating, our waiter over heard that I LOVE siracha on everything- so he brought out some siracha so I could add to my dish!  I was so impressed by their customer service that this spot will be one of my favorite places to eat Thai!  I highly suggest you trying it out!  It would be a great place for a date!  Oh sidenote- they had a pop radio station playing.  I found it funny/interesting that we were listening to Outkast while eating Thai."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for eight years and whenever I want a good sit down Asian restaurant I come here. It's got a great small restaurant atmosphere and the staff is always friendly. I always order the spicey chicken appetizer and would suggest it to anyone. The hot and sour soup also can't be beat.  The entrees are all reasonably priced and good portions. Be sure to ask the server if you are worried about the spice level of any dish - I have always known them to be accommodating to people's preferences. They also fo tons of take out.  Do not let it's location in a strip mall deter you from trying this if you are in the mood for some good Thai or Chinese dishes."}
{"text":"very tastefully and Thai hot. Excellent service, WILL BE BACK FORSURE:)"}
{"text":"This is my fav thai restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Compared to what I have tried so far, They have the most authentic thai food here, even better than the Thai Cuisine next door. I like most of their dishes (curries, noodles, soup), didn't try many appetizers though. Love all sorts of spicy noodles there! Pad thai is the best! Duck curry is also yummy. Be cautious, don't try 7 or above, because it can be really HOT!"}
{"text":"I have had every single plate in this restaurant, big portions. Another thing, their plates have so much flavor too it, you are able to pick the level of spiciness on every plate and also your choice of meat. Deserts are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I feel comfortable eating here. The they made a mistake one time and served me the wrong dish. But I didn't really care because the waitress was cute and the food was still amazing. ;)"}
{"text":"This would be a 5 star review because the food is excellent - my favorite is the Massaman Curry - but recently the service has become unacceptably slow especially at lunch time. If you are in a party of more than two or if more than one table orders at the same time expect a long wait. At least twice at lunch a member of our party has had to get a box to go because they waited more than 30 minutes for the food to appear. Again, the food is excellent  - nothing bad on the menu. You should definitely try it if you have the time."}
{"text":"At first glance, you wouldn't assume this place was anything special. It's located in a strip mall and looks pretty small. Don't let that put you off, the food tasted lovely and authentic and the service was absolutely excellent, which made the experience even better. We'll definitely be returning.  The reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because the panang curry was a little on the spicy side, even though I ordered medium it was more like hot to me. It still tasted good though."}
{"text":"This was my first time that I've ever tried Thai food, and i was a little concerned, but  the food is amazing!!! Great customer service, Great food, comfortable environment. I recommend this place to anyone out there looking for some great Thai food. I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"As I am starting to each much healthier I am exploring options that I would not normally explore.  I can't come up with any good reason why I never tried \"Thai\" food prior to this establishment however I have got to say that it's really fantastic!  My GF and I walked into this quaint little place.  The décor seems very traditional yet has a small cozy romantic atmosphere.  The wait staff is not only friendly but personable and even a little bit of jokesters.  The menu is pretty expansive with a good vegetarian and vegan selection.  We enjoyed it so much had dinner one night and lunch the next day.  Between the Hunan vegetables, Mapo tofu, coconut soup, & spring rolls the food is great.  Not too fried, but natural and tasty.  Very fresh, great spices.  Definitely will be back to try more of the menu"}
{"text":"A small family place with great food. They have huge portions. Highly recomended."}
{"text":"We are regulars here, and basically always order the General Tso tofu, because it's basically the best we've ever had. The service is great, the space itself is a little tight (let's call it \"intimate\") and we try to go at least once every couple of months."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today after seeing some stellar reviews. I was already excited about it, but it truly exceeded my expectations! We began with the calamari which was incredibly flavorful even without the sweet chilli sauce served with it. It was fresh, perfectly seasoned, and delightfully crispy.  I got the mango curry and my dining partner got the red curry. Presentation was beautiful and the curries were delicious. I was very happy to see that, unlike many other restaurants, the servings were very generous. Lots of chicken, mango, and veggies were there, and they weren't tiny little pieces.  Service was excellent. Our waitress was very sweet, and the food arrived very quickly. The calamari was still piping hot and sizzling when it got to the table!  I will definitely be eating here again."}
{"text":"The restaurant is located in the middle of nowhere but if you are looking for good Thai food, Thai Gourmet is highly recommended.  The service is good.  The waitress is always pleasant and very polite.    I LOVE their panang curry.  I always ask for mild one but it has nice kick to it, which is actually pretty good."}
{"text":"This is a great hidden gem! Been here twice, once during a rush and once being the only one here. The service was great and speedy both times. Servers were polite, funny, super friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu. Location very clean with an upscale feel to it. Tea never ran dry. Overall great place to eat! So delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered my favorite Thai Basil Fried Rice and it was a disappointment. It was too hot (spicy) for a 3 and the rice was not fried completely; there were still globs of white rice coated with the seasoning."}
{"text":"My sister took me here since I was visiting her for her graduation. She said this is her go-to Thai restaurant!  Pros: This place is sooo good! I didn't expect much for Asian food in Pittsburgh, but this place really impressed me. We got the green curry chicken, red curry beef, basil chicken, basil fried rice, and pad kee mao. For the most part, everything was good! And cheap too! In my experience, Thai food is always about $11-15 per entree, and they don't give much. But Thai Gourmet's dishes are about $8-10, and they give you SO much!! I was really impressed. And this place is SPICY!! They ask you what spice level you want on a scale from 1-10, and we got 5 for most of our dishes. It is definitely spicy for a level 5! But my family loves spicy so it was a nice spicy. And the service was great because the waitresses were ON POINT with topping off our water! They're probably used to it since they're food is so spicy haha. I really liked the green curry chicken and the basil chicken.   Cons: It's kinda in a sketchy area, but at least there is close-by parking.   Overall: This place is great!! Cheap, big portions, and super tasty! I wish I had a Thai place like this where I live. Definitely check it out if you haven't!!"}
{"text":"What a great spot!!! Wonderful friendly gentleman waited on me and the food was top notch! I ordered General Tso tofu and it looked like chicken. It's not. It's rolled tofu skin! Very unusual and very good!! Also there was a lovely homemade veg egg roll which was light and flakey. Excellent!! Everything can be made vegan so several return trips will be in order!!!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the city in my opinion. Recommend the fried rice dishes, they are very tasty. The atmosphere is very nice and friendly, definitely would recommend it for a nice weeknight."}
{"text":"What a sweet surprise... for a little strip mall restaurant they really had an amazing choice of delicious menu items at reasonable prices. The presentation was top shelf. Scrumptious spring rolls and delicious noodles for me... my sister had a coconut noodle soup called Tom Kha. We will definitely be back and with friends."}
{"text":"3732 Darrow Rd # 5 Stow, OH 44224 (330) 688-0880 Sister restaurant to Pad Thai in Hudson/Stow. You'll find Thai Gourmet nestled in a strip store area on Rt. 91. The inside is tiny but they managed to make it a soothing environment. I generally get the Avocado Chicken, Basil Beef, or Garlic Eggplant for entree along with Thai rolls or pot-stickers for appetizer.  The price is just right for good, fresh food and it's always cooked just right. I only gave it 4 stars because Pad Thai is slightly better in quality but it's pretty close. You can take-out or dine-in and either option is good. For take-out: order your food and then shop for dessert at Marc's just two doors down while you wait. Average wait time for take out is 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Nice little Thai restaurant! Service was great, and the flat noodles I got were delicious!  I am very picky with my orders, and the server was very friendly and patient as she found the answers to all my questions. When my order arrived, she asked, did you want tomatoes? I was like, oh no. So she immediately tried to take my order back to redo. I told her I can just pick it out. She apologized for not letting me know beforehand.  She was so sweet, and our food was great! My friend tried their pho, and it was her first bowl of pho, and she approved as well.  The restaurant is a little further from my house, and I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"4 & 3/4  Best west valley Thai so far!  My missing star is really about personal preference. I started eating Thai food at a restaurant that used fresh veggies from the local farmers market so every dish was stuffed full of thin sliced veggies: carrots, zucchini, squash, sugar snap peas etc adding a freshness and color where it seems most everywhere else uses traditional frozen veggies or  in this case fresh veggies cut like frozen:/ I'm not saying our meal was not delicious because it WAS (4 3/4 stars!!!) and the staff couldn't have been friendlier, kinder or more attentive. DEFINITE REPEAT WHEN OVER HERE! Full belly and leftovers to boot:)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great value. Closed 2:30-4pm though,  at present this isn't reflected in their hours on yelp. I eat curries, fried rice, drunken noodles, love it all... I've never really had a bad dish here."}
{"text":"Drove past this restaurant for years and today I finally tried it when suggested by a colleague. There's a nice selection on the menu and I tried the mango shrimp... mmmmmm mmmmmmm good! I had it with the brown rice and all were delicious! We opted for the carryout option, so I'm not able to comment on the ambiance of the dining area, but the food was great!"}
{"text":"This is NOT Thai food. I repeat, this is NOT THAI FOOD! I ordered the pad thai for lunch this afternoon, 38 minutes ago to be exact. As a matter of fact, it's still sitting in front of me. Drenched in some sort of red/orange oil? The chicken is dry and the shrimp might be composed of rubber. The fact that the name of this place is called \"Thai Gourmet\" is ridiculous. This is Chinese food with a lime tossed on it.  I'm bummed that I paid $9 for a cup of \"pad thai\" and even tipped the man $2. I would have rather just thrown the money away.  Edit: I've actually thrown this away and ate Chef Boyardi for lunch. Which strangely tasted similar to the pad thai."}
{"text":"Great service and a great meal! The massaman curry was so good!  Do yourself a favor and eat at this hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Very cute restaurant and friendly staff who welcome you as soon as you enter. The food is always delicious and so is the Thai iced tea. I also like that they have different levels of spiciness you can choose from."}
{"text":"This is a nice little BYOB in Pittsburgh.  They have table service even though it seems more of a place to go and pick up something.  I had the tofu curry which was awesome.  I liked how you can pick how spicy you want it to be on a scale of 1-10.  I got a 6 and it was plenty spicy!"}
{"text":"When I visit the burgh' THIS is the place to eat for a Thai food fix.   Tasty spring rolls, 'just right spice' curries and Tom Ka Soups are great. Great service to boot.  Tip: There are two Thai restaurants on the same street, yes-- go here, it is not as fancy.. BUT.. is the better tasting food."}
{"text":"Friendly and tasty restaurant in a place that great asian food is considered a diamond find! I was thoroughly surprised and happy to find this Thai restaurant while on a business trip. The portion is nice and big. Staffs are flexible if you wanted to change up something on the menu. My favorite dish was the duck basil rice plate."}
{"text":"Greatest tasting Tom Yum (lemongrass soup) in Pittsburgh hands down.  Many of their curries including \"Garlic\" are really good, as is the Massamun, and they have these neat samosa dumplings that remind you of India!  Very nice family, they have a monk son who sometimes shows up wearing his orange robes straight from the Far East!  Awesome \"clean hole in the wall\" feel and recently remodeled."}
{"text":"First time here! And let me say it's AMAZING!! We were looking at the reviews and I have to agree with all of them! The food it's amazing and the workers are soo nice and carrying! If you're looking for amazing Thai food this one right here is the one! Chicken pad Thai and Shrimp fried rice was what we got!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue...Cute little restaurant.,,food and service is excellent.,,nothing negative..will visit again."}
{"text":"Small place. Excellent customer service. Food is wonderful. My husband and I have tried several dishes and have enjoyed all of them."}
{"text":"When it comes to Thai food, I'm pretty boring. Nine times out of ten at a Thai restaurant, I'll order the same thing -- prik khing chicken. It's a fairly basic chicken with veggie dish, but the sauce is really what makes it sing. So I judge all Thai restaurants by how well they make this dish. And Thai Gourmet wins. The veggies are cooked to a crisp perfection, they are generous with the chicken, and the sauce is super flavorful and spicy without being too oily -- just how I like it.  Speaking of spicy, another reason that I like this place is that they aren't afraid to use a real 1-10 spicy scale instead of the \"wimpy person\" spicy scale. I've been to other Thai restaurants (I'm looking at you, Thai Place) where I'd order a 10 and it would barely tickle my tongue. Not so with Thai Gourmet! They mean business with their spice. I can handle my heat, and for me a 7 to 8 on their scale really gets the ol' sweat glands going. And I love that!  Lastly, the portions at this place are HUGE. A dinner order of the prik khing chicken (or pad thai or anything else there) is easily enough for two meals. And considering that the entrees are reasonably priced (around $10-13 bucks for dinner), I think this is a great value. Also, when you get your food to take out, they sometimes include a little dessert for free (brownie or tapioca pudding).  The only thing I don't like about this place is that you can't sub brown rice for white. This is one of the only Thai places I've been to that doesn't serve brown rice. So much for trying to add a little fiber to my meal. Ah well, still delicious and still 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Thai Gourmet. It is the freshest, most delicious Thai food I've ever tasted. Family-run and comfortable, the waitresses have literally said things like, \"My mom's cooking today, she makes it really spicy, just so you know...\" And they will actually make your food spicy. If you order a 10, damn sure it will be a TEN. The lunch special is the best deal in the city. For around $7, you will get a spring roll, amazing lemongrass or wonton soup, plus your invariably gigantic entree. I have actually taken leftovers from lunch, which I honestly don't think has ever happened before. The Nam Prik is my favorite: a bowl of saucy, spicy, peanutty (?) chicken, with noodles, tempura vegetables, and lettuce on the side. The basil chicken, pad see ew, and prik king are not to be missed. Even the General Tso is wonderfully unique. Plus, your food comes really quickly, which I appreciate at lunch."}
{"text":"I've visited this restaurant a couple of times before today but that was several years ago. I thought it would be nice to return to see if they had changed.  Unfortunately, today's visit was terribly disappointing.   At first, I started with an order of potstickers. They arrived quickly but looked more like chinese fried dumplings instead of potstickers. They tasted okay but I was hoping for more.  I ordered pad thai with chicken for my entree (it's a thai restaurant, afterall) to be safe. I was very unhappy with this dish when I started eating it. The chicken was hard and tough and the noodles were bland and soggy. I almost never send my food back usually but today was an exception. The server was kind enough to comply with my request to replace the pad thai with their pho. She told me that she would have to charge me for the price of the pho as it was more expensive than the pad thai and I agreed. Again, I was not happy with the pho. The menu listed the pho came with basil but the bowl did not contain any. It was served with some siracha and hoisin sauce on the side. The broth was dark, bland and contained onions. I wish they had not called it 'pho' because it wasn't.  I simply cannot give this place more than one star even though the server was adequate and their decor was pleasant."}
{"text":"It all started with a grumpy woman who took my order at the front cashier desk. I ordered two traditional curry dishes, and said that \"I like spicy, I see that they are listed as spicy on the menu.\"  \"Yes\" was the only response. Any pleasantries were initiated by me, in other words I never heard a \"thank you\" and a grudging \"your welcome\" was received after my thank you's. I tried, since she seemed to be in a bad mood.  But I thought anyone can have a bad day, and I was looking forward to some good Thai food. That wasn't to happen.  This was the blandest, sweetest, no spice at all Green Curry and Massaman I've ever had. No hint of peanut in the Massaman, the slightest hint of green curry seasoning, basically a very cheaply made highly Americanized version of Thai food.  I don't understand all of the positive reviews, perhaps these are folks that prefer a very watered down version of Thai food. I don't mean to insult the other reviewers, I just don't think they have been exposed to real (good) Thai food.  If you want good, traditional, Thai food, this isn't the place."}
{"text":"My goodness! What's to be said that hasn't already been spoken! Thai Gourmet is amazing! The ingredients are quality and fresh, the atmosphere is welcoming and the spice levels are true to expectations! I recently went there for a dinner with some friends and the Thai fried rice was messed up delicious. You will notice the reviews that say that the portions are huge and that is absolutely correct. However, I managed to stuff my face until my plate was empty and I am well known for leaving a plate pretty full! I ordered a 7...solid for anyone looking for as much heat as possible without overpowering the nuances of the dish. Nothing negative to say in the slightest. Perfect meal."}
{"text":"I'm stuck between a 3-4 stars.. I ordered deliver from here today for the first time.  The young man who answered was very polite and had great service. I ordered spring rolls, combination pad Thai and chicken fried rice.  The food was delivered quickly!!  However, it wasn't what I expected.. The pad thai was a little bland.. And the spring rolls were plain also.. Everything came out to 36 dollars.. With tip to about 41. Which seemed a bit pricy to me.  Only because I've been to places where it wasn't as pricy for good quality food.  I am however willing to give this place another try.. I don't think I would order the pad thai or rolls again."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, absolutely legitimate Thai food. The service is horrible. The first night I went the waitress failed to get our order entered into the POS system. The servers did not discover this for 30 minutes. New servers need to be trained not only in service, but have some understanding of the food.  The second night we went they only had one server and they were busy. The server brought Tom Yum soup with chicken instead of seafood. The server never checked on us after placing the food and it took awhile to get her attention to get it changed. I ended up eating my curry while it was still hot, and my girlfriend finally received her corrected Tom Yum 30 minutes later. They need to cut a hole in the front counter so that the servers don't have to walk so far just to get to the dining room. It's one of the reasons that the service is so slow.  I hope the owners read my review because as a Chef who has traveled all over Asia I know one thing that is certain, restaurants with great food and poor service rarely last."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Went in a party of  12 and everyone loved their food. Half of the party was vegetarian, while the rest of us was are meat eater. They had a wide plate selection for both sides. Service and food will keep us coming back"}
{"text":"Had a late dinner here one evening. I sat myself and then waited about 10 minutes before I was brought a menu and water.  Ordered the Tom Yum soup with chicken and a the Kee Mao Gai with chicken.  The soup had a nice spice level. But the Kee Mao Gai was sitting in a pool of liquid - first time I've ever had a drunken noodle dish swimming in liquid. Not a great dish.  #ThaiGourmet"}
{"text":"Neat little Thai place. Fairly good selection of food items. We ordered dumplings and calamari. The presentation on both was excellent!  Our dinner was pork fried rice and #24, I couldn't repeat the name if I tried.  Both were delicious.  Our server was very good and attentive. I thought the prices were very reasonable especially for the quality of the food.  We will come back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this little place, it's a great find since there are very few Tai restaurants around. We have been here a couple times and we have got the pad tai both times. The noodles seem homemade and the sauce is superb. The first time we went they had this spice on the table that I even tried to duplicate at home it was so good. It was super spicy and putting it on the pad tai was fantastic. We had a shrimp dish the next time too and it was great. I will definitely be back to try more.   There is never very many people here but I'm thinking it's bc it's very hard to find. I do think it is a little pricy so not something to do every week but great for a little change of pace."}
{"text":"This is my first visit and I was pleasantly surprised. In addition to the Thai food restaurant offers Chinese and Cantonese. It has been years since I have had such a delicious dish of war su gai. The fried chicken was tender and crispy, the spices complemented each other and there was just enough ginger to complete the meal."}
{"text":"Great new business to the Avondale Goodyear area. I enjoyed the service, the restaurant was very clean and well kept, my order was spot on and very tasty. The price point is very fair and your could easily get dinner for 2 under $20. I enjoyed the house fried rice and the pad Thai the most. The PHO is also authentic and very good here. Everyone seemed pleased with their order and the service seemed to go out of their way to make sure everything was correct and what the customers wanted when they originally ordered. They do not accept checks but do take cards and checks. I would say it's perfect for groups of 6 and under as it's not a very large restaurant. I liked pretty much everything about this place and would recommend it to my fellow local yelpers. Pho k yeah!"}
{"text":"my favorite thai place in pittsburgh, i've been here quite a few times but i always order the same dish, the pumpkin curry is good, i hear the duck curry is amazing.  This place is a really relaxed kitschy thai restaurant with eclectic decor and good food."}
{"text":"Thai food is one of the easiest to make ethnic foods at your home and have it taste fairly authentic. So I generally rate Thai restaurants on how does their dish they make compare to how I have had in Thailand and how I make it at home.   While the food at Thai Gourmet is edible, although greasy, my companion agreed that I could make better dishes than this. Now that does not constitute a put-down or I'm trying to say that the food sucked - it didn't it was good. (It's really hard to make Thai food poorly IMHO) However, as another poster said, they seem to know they have strong competition down the street where you get incredible food so they are trying to win on the portion size and value while the quality is not quite there.  Take the 3 star rating for what's it worth, the food is OK but there are much better places to go."}
{"text":"Hard to find a clean, nice Thai place that has such helpful, kind service.  Fried rice we split was great, my Pad Kee Mao was spicy and delicious, and the wife's cashew chicken was very good. We paid about $25 including a drink. Will be back often."}
{"text":"Decent Chinese food with some Thai influence.  This is not really a Thai restaurant.  I did however like the food.  I'll come back when I'm in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't drive across town for it."}
{"text":"Overall: The food is decent with large portions.  Food: 3 stars.  Pad See Ew was good with fresh vegetables and had huge portions.  Coconut Chicken Soup was bland.  Prices: 3 stars.  Pad See Ew was $12 and they charged $2 for extra broccoli.  Coconut Chicken Soup is $3, which is low.  Appearance: 3 stars.  Interior looks like a standard Thai restaurant.  The one wall in a full mirror is a bit much."}
{"text":"I have tried this place twice. The first time we dined in  the food was okay, not very flavorful. It lacked any spices even though the dishes were labeled as extra spicy. The second time I got the pad see ew to go... So disappointed. It was just noodles and vegetables thrown together. No sauce, no flavor. Just bland. The tofu was brutally overcooked. Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I went to Thai Gourmet because my other favorite Thai place was closed on Monday. I called to order pick up. The food was ready when I got there. I ordered the Pad Thai. The food was okay. Not the best Thai I've ever had but it was so-so. They gave me a little brownie as dessert that was pretty good. Overall it was good. I'd still go there again."}
{"text":"Now, I've only been to two different Thai places in Pittsburgh, the other being Nicki's. I did enjoy Nicki's slightly better, and I think they are a 4 or 5. So. Here we are.   Service was pretty on par. Water barely was ever empty, and the food came out in under ten minutes after ordering. Which was awesome but at the same time actually kind of startling. We both had curry, I assume they prepare a  bunch of it in the back and just finish it up and serve it. Not that that's a bad thing, I'm not a professional, and I don't know proper curry preparation practices. Lol. So maybe this is normal.   The flavor was pretty good; I'd say it was on the same level or a slight step lower compared to the other place I've been to. However, I did find the chicken to be pretty chewy which was a turn off, and my only real complaint.   The lunch curry came with a choice of lemongrass or wonton soup. I got the wonton, good choice, it was wholesome and savory. It also came with a small spring roll.   I will definitely come back here to try some different dishes!   Oh, shit almost forgot. The Thai tea was great!"}
{"text":"If you're into SPICY Thai, this is your spot. My date and I stopped in for lunch and we got their lunch special - curry and either a sring roll or soup. We opted for lemongrass soup, summer rolls, a green curry and a panang curry. The summer rolls were excellent and the lemongrass was seasoned very well. I would like to see more veggies in it other than just a few mushrooms.  I ordered a 7/10 for my curry and it was by far one of the spiciest dishes I have ever eaten. And I love spicy food! I've had Thai HOT at other Thai restaurants and it wasn't as hot as my curry. WOW!  I had to pack up most to go because the spicy level was slowing me down. I ate the rest as a late dinner and again, nearly burned my mouth off. The staff was friendly and helpful and we were pleased by our experience. Prior to dining in, I had only ordered pickup multiple times. The portions match the price and I look forward to going back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We had some delicious take-out from Thai Gourmet last Saturday night.  We placed the order by phone, and then left almost immediately to pick it up.  The food was ready when we got there about 15 minutes later.  The prices were pretty good, and since you get such large portions, your money goes a long way.  The food was still hot when we got it home (yay!) so we immediately dug in.  First was our appetizer, the Hoi Jo - sort of a deep fried appetizer made of crabmeat, ground pork, and spices.  Sweet plum sauce accompanied it.  This appetizer was really tasty, a bit dry but the plum sauce really livened it up.  My boyfriend had the panang curry with chicken, which he really enjoyed.  I tasted it briefly and agreed it was very good, better quality than lots of other Thai we've had.  I got the Chiang Mai Me, which I'd never heard of but ended up being a great choice!  It was long egg noodles covered in a wonderful yellow curry sauce.  I got it with tofu, which was cut into long strips instead of cubes, and was also a little dry so I'd recommend maybe trying chicken or another meat instead.  Nonetheless, the curry sauce was excellent and abundant, and made glorious leftovers.    They also threw in fortune cookies AND these two super-moist brownies!  They were probably just made from a box mix, but still - it was awesome to have a surprise dessert.  I think we'd definitely order from here again.  It was above average, though not hugely so.  But our first impression was very good, and it's a very welcome change from all the Chinese food in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Setting: 1:10 on a Tuesday afternoon. They close at 2:30pm and reopen later for dinner.   I got a lunch special with a friend, which consisted of Tom Yum soup and a spring roll. The soup was unexpectedly spicy, slightly more than maybe a teaspoon of Sriracha. Spring roll was okay.   They brought the lunch out within 5 minutes of bringing the appetizer out! But it was quite spicy to me (I got a 4 out of 10 on the spice scale). Of course, we're talking authentic Thai food. So it probably would have been more delicious to me if I was more spice oriented. I ordered the Chiang Mai Mee, which seemed to be coconut milk based, and much more sweet than I wished is was. This is how authentic Thai is made, apparently, so I suppose I'm more a fan of Americanized Thai.   My friend's experience was subpar. She ordered a few dishes for her colleagues from the office, which were made quickly. But one of the dishes was incorrect (noodle dish instead of the rice dish my friend ordered), and waitress asked if we could come back later (probably around the dinner time, since it was already 2:20) to pick up the correct dish. At this point, my friend asked if they could just remake the one they made incorrectly, to which the waitress replied, \"Hey, we make mistakes too.\" My friend didn't get the dish that she wanted, and she's not planning on returning.   Overall, an average place to eat, but the waitress's attitude was uncalled for. They absolutely should have remade that dish for free. If you want authentic Thai food (and have the stomach for the spiciness), then you might enjoy this place."}
{"text":"This is one of my go to spots in Independence...there isn't much in the way of Asian cuisine in the Cleveland area...even the sushi is nothing compared to what I'm used to at home...so when I'm in town...I make it a point to come here and eat. I always order the thai tea...and now even my boyfriend is addicted to it!"}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet's food is just 'pretty good,' but I keep going back because I like the meal experience there; it's the only Thai place I know of where you can eat at a counter and they keep Christmas lights in the windows all year.   Because it's in a narrow row house and decorated like your great aunt's living room (assuming she's the kind of woman who loves wood paneling and house plants), the ambiance is unpretentious in the best way possible.   Standard Thai dishes like pad thai, green curry, larb and pad kee mow are solid, but other classics that should be equally solid, such as salad rolls, tom kha gai soup and panang curry always leave me wanting more spice, depth and--I hate to trot out the most clichéd foodie term ever, but--complexity of flavor.   Thai ice tea, contrary to popular belief, can be done wrong if it's wwwaaaayyyyy too bitter or wwwaaaayyyyy too sweet, but these guys whip it up good.  I also like to play menu adventures here: this is the game where I ask the server (one of the owner's daughters) what's good and then pick whatever sounds most crazy. It's been awesome at helping be break out of my Thai food rut, which previously consisted exclusively of fish cakes, papaya salad and panang curry."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. Located in a strip mall with glaring fluorescent lights this restaurant serves wonderful food!  Like all little gems you are never sure if you tell everyone about the great food and service or keep it a secret so that nothing changes.  The food was awesome, service was great, dinner was perfect."}
{"text":"Returned again second week of April, my friend really wanted to come here. We both got the green curry, I got beef and they had chicken. Added extra spice to mine from table assortment. Was really nice first time ordering this green curry.  Service was good as usual."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Thai place I've ever been thus far!!! One of the best Thai food! Great quality, great price, and great portions! For lunch they even give out free wontoon soup and egg roll. The sever is always friendly and offers extra rice for no extra charge.  Caution: The spicy level 10 is very hot! Its finally an Asian place where their spicy rating system is accurate.   Would recommend and go anytime I'm back in Pittsburgh. MUST TRY"}
{"text":"Definitely a front runner for best Thai in my book. Of course I got the Pumpkin Tofu Curry. If you have read any of my other reviews  you may notice that's all I get at Thai restaurants. It's not because I'm afraid to try anything else - it's that it is SO good to me that I would regret not getting it ever. But I have a little thing going here - maybe someday I will be the Pumpkin Tofu Curry expert.  Anyway, this was my 3rd time eating here. The first time we got takeout and were so pleased with everything. The second time we ate-in and had a great experience as well, so we went back 5 days later. (OK, we might be addicts.) Last night when we went we both got the Fresh tofu spring rolls to start and each got the pumpkin curry. The spring rolls were large, fresh and delicious. The dipping sauce was perfection. I ordered tofu as usual, Forest ordered chicken. We both stepped up the spice level to a 7. It was perfect. The tofu here is the best I've had: generous portions, great texture. The pumpkin was perfect and they also add carrots, peas and peppers to the mix. The spice level was good for me - a little heat, but not overwhelming.  The staff is awesome - super sweet and friendly. They replenish rice as soon as it looks like your getting low, and service is really fast. I love this place. It is my current fave. My only beef is that they don't have brown rice as an option - but honestly it doesn't matter because they're that good."}
{"text":"Our first visit...this place is amazing. I haven't had authentic Thai food this good in years! Easily rivals and surpasses east coast Thai restaurants we've been too."}
{"text":"The best.  Drunken Noodles are delicious.  In fact, I'm going there right now to get some."}
{"text":"Really fabulous food. Freshness, quality - and amazing, delightful flavors. The staff and owners are wonderful and warm."}
{"text":"My review is more of a 3.5 instead of a 3, but alas there is no such option.   Went to this place on a Tuesday night and was pleasantly surprised. The interior is small and sort of kitschy with the decor, and the service was very attentive and friendly.   We had an order of the fresh summer rolls with chicken to start. They weren't horrible, but there was too much iceberg lettuce and the chicken was dry, but the sauce made them passable. I got the red curry with pork and my friend got the fried rice with pork. My curry was thick and creamy but the pork was very dry. I loved it anyhow and would probably get it again with a different protein or stick with the veggie version. I was able to taste the fried rice and it was yummy, although heavy with sauce so I probably wouldn't order it for myself.   All in all I had a good experience and am definitely excited to try something different."}
{"text":"It's small place, but the food is good compare to other Thai places that are around the area of Goodyear, Avondale and Litchfield Park."}
{"text":"Had the Moo Goo Gai Pan for lunch (to go). I thought that it was a little pricier for what I got. Also I found this to be pretty bland. With the other reviews, it seems like this was isolated. So I will have to give it a second try. Next time I will order something else."}
{"text":"This is the second time here and will be several more! Everything we have had so far is amazing... Mango curry, pineapple curry, spring rolls and pad Thai... Have all been excellent choices!"}
{"text":"BIG disappointment! This place is way over priced for the quality. The first problem is that there is no online menu. I had to use a reviewers phone pics of the menu. This isn't a new establishment and it's not a good sign that they can't even get it together enough to have the menu online. When I called to place our order the person was rude and kept cutting me off and put me on hold. My fiancée had the Kung Pao Shrimp and enjoyed it although it was swimming in sauce. The egg rolls had a funny taste that was a turn off and had to be smothered in sweet and sour to eat them. I had the Sweet and Sour Chicken and it was horrible. Threw most of it away. The oil had to have been old and they desiccated it by over cooking. The only thing I enjoyed was the fried rice with chicken. Some of the best I've had surprisingly enough. I will not go back to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I love Thai Gourmet! Never had a bad experience or a bad meal here. I have worked through the curries and today I had Tom Yum soup with chicken and chocked spicy noodles. Delicious as always. This is a small place in a busy strip mall so I typically try to eat a late lunch and when possible sit outside. The parking is good for people watching which is good because it doesn't offer much of a view. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. It costs a couple of dollars more than cheep Chinese but is so much more delicious. If you yearn for something out of the ordinary I think you will be very pleased to try Thai Gourmet on Rockside Road."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times and the food is always good. We particularly like the Pad Thai, the Pad Kee Moa (drunken noodles) and the red and yellow curry. The fresh spring rolls are good, and really big, too. Keep in mind when you order Thai hot, it IS Thai hot!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my new favorite thai restaurant. The restaurant is clean and I love how our table is covered with white tablecloth. The food is great! My favorite is the tofu fried rice and the panang curry! Coconut soup is good too! We will come back to try some more dishes. The owner is really nice and very friendly. I brought McDonalds because my 8 yr. old brother is allergic to peanuts and seafood and many more (just to be safe) and she ok with it."}
{"text":"My favorite... Always. I started coming here because it was by my orthodontist's office. The food is perfectly delicious, perfectly priced. I love all of their vegetarian options. When I met the man I am now married to, I brought him here and he loves it. We have tried other Thai places around town and in other cities, but most places are waaaayyy too salty. Thai gourmet is unbeatable in its perfection. The staff is always friendly and the order is never wrong."}
{"text":"Graciously large portions, amazing bang for your buck (especially for the lunch specials) and when you say 6 on the 'spicy scale' be prepared to take a fire punch to your taste buds. For a dreary day, the cacti and abundance of flora in the window almost make it feel 'tropical' inside. I adored the cultural nic nacs in every corner. It's a regular stop on my trips to the 'Burgh and the area has fun new shops springing up for some after lunch shopping! (Like BoomBox!)"}
{"text":"Very clean and relatively new restaurant with quick and friendly service. I decided to eat at Thai Gourmet after seeing all the good reviews and I was definitely not disappointed.   We ordered the papaya salad (Thai style) and gyoza appetizers. The gyoza were tasty but I prefer homemade (who doesn't?). The papaya salad, however, was SO GOOD. Had a hint of spiciness without being overpowering and was very flavorful. I am tempted to order it as my entree the next time I visit.  I ordered the massaman curry with chicken (they had run out of beef when I asked) while my family ordered the Thai fried rice (chicken), pahd kee mao (chicken) and one of the stir fry dishes (can't remember which, but it was combination meat). The massaman curry was delicious though I was a little disappointed that they had run out of beef. However, it was the end of the night. Because they were out of beef, the stir fry that was ordered with combination meat also didn't have any beef. I don't know if extra portions of the other meats were added in to make up for this. But I noticed that they did not inform us that the dish wouldn't have beef in it--when the server came back to our table, he said only that they were out of \"massaman beef\" and not beef in general. Did not personally try the fried rice but my father, who is extremely picky, absolutely loved it. However, my brother, who is also picky, said the pahd kee mao was just \"okay\" (it's normally his favorite dish).  Thai Gourmet is family-run but our food still seemed to arrive quickly despite having only one (maybe two?) chefs in the kitchen. I think if you come with a very large group then you might have to deal with only a couple of people getting their food at a time. Our group was small so it was pretty unnoticeable. Everyone there is super friendly and the environment was bright and clean.  I knocked one star off since my family thought the pahd kee mao and stir fry was mediocre and because of the missing beef (and lack of notification) in the combination stir fry; however, I think Thai Gourmet is definitely worth a visit if you like Thai food. I'll definitely come back the next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Phoenix. Nothing tops it. Plus it's clean which is always a good thing because it's hard to find a tasty restaurant that has a good appearance and great food."}
{"text":"Yes, on the surface it seems too upscale for a strip mall, but it's never uptight and the prices are reasonable.  Why the complaints?  I really enjoy a swanky atmosphere with good food, regardless of the setting.  I highly recommend the peanut and massaman curry dishes - delicious!  Food is always made-to-order and is prepared very quickly.  Okay, maybe the service isn't five-star, but it's always prompt and accurate - good enough for me."}
{"text":"Unassuming atmosphere.  Staff was pleasant.  We started with the mixed appetizer plate.  It was good....not great but good.     Dinner choice was green curry with nests of rice noodle, and tempura veggies and a side salad.  The portion was big enough to share.   Not the best Thai in town but good food at great prices."}
{"text":"I walk in and tell the servers to surprise me. Every time and I'm always so happy!!!  1 Spicy Peanut- 1B Prik Pao 3 Thai Spaghetti 4 Garlic Chicken  5 Pad Thai.   So darn a good and the lunch time servers are extraordinary."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch and ha the most delicious  red curry dish (#17) with tofu. Absolutely fabulous! !!!!!  Okay, they don't have a lunch menu, but the quality and presentation of the food is wonderful. I will definitely  be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, this place needs to be open ere'day though... I wanted food on a Monday and it was a let down but, their food is bomb.com/tellyomom  I love their tofu & red curry, pad Tai. Best Thai food? I don't know it's debatable but, it's one of the best in this area."}
{"text":"I've only been here once... but they have pretty decent curry.   I also tried the sweet rice with mango. VERY DELICIOUS. I recommend getting that for dessert!"}
{"text":"I used to be a big fan of this place, but ever since they opened another location 2 miles away, they've staffed this one with their B-team, and its been going downhill.  The food is still decent, but service and wait time is getting out of control.  On the last visit, I waited much longer to just get the check, than it took to order and eat.  Not worth blowing 2 hours of your day to eat here."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the Valley. The food is fresh and the flavors are great. If you like to bring the heat be prepared to get burned, because they definitely know how to layer the heat in a great way. Never been disappointed in anything we have ever ordered."}
{"text":"I asked for take out and for chow mein (egg noodles) with chicken and I didn't even get that. They gave me a huge thing of lettuce and chicken and covered it up with those crispy noodles. Look if it's not something you have then say it don't act like you have it and charge me $20 for something I didn't even order. I'll never come here again. Also ordered Thai iced tea and they failed to add the cream. Terrible service, okay food, and too expensive."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and service!! Very authentic! I definitely would repeat at least  twice monthly"}
{"text":"This place is tiny... but they put in a good effort to make it as nice as possible. Turns out they're connected to Pad Thai in Fairlawn, which makes the decor make more sense. Not really sure why both places blare smooth jazz though.  But anyways, I've been here a few times. The service is always good, very friendly, and fast.  The thai rolls are awesome crispy spring rolls filled with ground chicken, shrimp and veggies, served with a sweet thai sauce that I could drink by itself.  The pad thai is always good. I once was given overcooked rubbery shrimp... But the rest of the dish was still really good, so I just scooted it to the side of the plate.  The thai iced tea, super sweet, but delicious.  If you're not into all the chain restaurants in the area (which I definitely am not), give it a try.  High tables, so not very child friendly."}
{"text":"Best thai food in west valley!!! Authentic, fresh flavors. Everything tastes made from scratch and has such a punch of flavor. The smell itself when you walk in makes your mouth water, coconut and thai spices. Its small and its not fancy, but for me its all about the food and this place delivers. I always get the thai hot and sour soup(like tom yum) and ive tried all the curries and they are all delicious but my favorite is the yellow curry. The drunken noodles have a great flavor and chew to them with thai basil for an herby afternote, just ask for light oil or it will be over oily, at least for me it was. Beware of the spice level, their hot is HOTTT, i dont dare to try thai hot but if you can handle it props to you. Definitely will be back, its never disappointed and i havent been disappointed with anything ive ordered."}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet is the bomb spot. Good for dates. Good for friends. Good for takeout. Good for eating in. Good for solo lunch. Good for everything. The food is a perfect comfort without sacrificing flavor, and I've never been disappointed in any order I've placed.  Sometimes people I know who don't like spicy will order something less spicy and it will come out very spicy, so be careful dealing with their 1-10 scale. This doesn't affect me because I don't care about spicy, but it is still something worth knowing.  Because I'm both a total sucker and also a white dude who grew up in the woods, while the Thai food here is incredible, the more Americanized comfort food is what I tend to go for. Crab Voluptuous, Wonton soup, and General Tso's chicken. If you're a vegetarian, you can get General Tso's tofu. If you're vegan, you can get Vegan General Tso's tofu. Or if you're not a sucker, their Thai food is delicious, too."}
{"text":"For me, this is one of those places where I want go around to each table and ask randos if I can taste their dinner, just so I can try everything! It's delish, it's super affordable, it's quiet (and you all know how I love quiet), and the staff are so wonderful. The BF and I have been going her for years. Why I haven't written a review is beyond me, but we went for dinner and I thought...I really have to share this place. The food is absolutely phenomenal, and I mean PHENOMENAL. I have never had anything here that didn't make me want to run in the kitchen and start licking the pots and pans. As a rule, I usually get the Pad Thai, because, well, it's Pad Thai, possibly the best dish on the planet. But I have tried other things here, and if you like different curries, this is place to get brave. The pumpkin curry is so out-of-this-world. Pumpkin Curry! Yeah. I never thought I'd say that about a pumpkin curry, but it's true! It's now one of my favorite dishes.  The stir fries -i.e. eggplant basil, basil leaves- are both awesome as well. We've tried almost all the apps and sometimes I dream about going and just ordering all the apps. Well, maybe two orders of fish cakes. Yeah, fish cakes! The old me would have never even tasted something called a fish cake, but here I am, salivating at the thought of them.  This place has truly changed my idea of what delicious is."}
{"text":"This place was nice. The location is small but the layout is not cramp, of course, we arrived as they opened so we were the only ones there. The food isn't much to rave about, it's decent enough but it is far from the best Thai I've had. The fried rice was a bit salty.   However, the service was excellent. Quick and friendly. After our meal, the owner came out to ask how everything was."}
{"text":"Great pad Thai and friendly service. Accommodating to gluten free which was great. Took family who had never had Thai food before and they loved it."}
{"text":"A little difficult to fond since there's no sign. Next by Beef O'Brady. Thai roll is really good. Full of shrimp and pork flavor. Learn beef salad is really tasty. Ice cold lettuce cups to fill with tasty fillings. First time to try avocado curry with shrimp. Perfect match protein. Not too spicy and very light coconut curry. Finished off with Thai iced tea.   Great service. Definitely will be back to try more items on menu."}
{"text":"First off this restaraunt is my family's. The food is really good. Taste like my dad's cooking. Brings me back to when I was 7 eating big bowel of rice and the peppered steak and the Tum yum soup."}
{"text":"We have lived in Phoenix 6 years and could never find a Thai place but now we did.  We leave in N. Phoenix but was in the area and come for dinner.  Everything was yummy and the waitress was so nice.  We had potstickers- ordered 2nd order, laab,and lo mein.  It is worth the drive and we will be back!!."}
{"text":"This place has such delicious food and the service is wonderful. They are very attentive and nice. The Tom Yum soup is amazing! I highly recommend this place if you are looking for some good Thai food. The pad Thai and fried rice are excellent choices as well.  Note: if you don't so very spicy things be careful. I would start with the lowest spice and work your way up. The spice is leveled one to five, with five being the hottest. Level one is plenty spice for us. We made the mistake of doing level 3 at first, which was pretty hot!"}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review..  This restaurant compelled me to write this.. First off I am not a Thai food conoissuer, that being said, OMG...  Had the penang curry withshrimp..  To die for..  It was what my tastebuds hadbeen craving, a symphony of flavors, awesome...   The f2f had volcano shrimp..  Very good.the spring very light and refreshing also awesome. Not much atmosphere but if you're looking for good thai, looknofurther..."}
{"text":"\"Authentic Thai food with probably the BEST lunch deal\"  Thai Gourmet's lunch special is really bang for your bucks! Seriously, this might be the best Thai lunch deal in Pittsburgh.  You get to pick from 27 different entrees, add meat or vegetables, and choose the spiciness. This comes with either Tom Yum Soup or Wonton soup. Also the best part is that this will most likely come under $10! Also, Their portions are pretty decent and I was very full by the end of the meal.   I ordered the Pad thai with pork in spiciness level 7. I love and can handle spicy food (Korean, Thai food are my fav), so I choose 7 and it was perfect. My friend ordered a 5, and we could barely taste the spiciness, so if you like spicy food I recommend choosing 7 or above.   There wasn't any line and the place didn't seem too busy even during lunch hour. But this place isn't too big doesn't have too many tables."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food!  We were craving Thai food so I checked on Yelp and this place was the closest and got good reviews. 25 minute drive each way, but SO worth it!  We ordered take out. I got the Penang Curry with Tofu, Hubby had Massaman Curry with chicken. He asked for his Thai hot, but no-one ever believes that you really want Thai hot. But it was still good.  Tofu was the kind I like, nice and soft and plenty of it.  We will definitely be going back, maybe to eat in next time."}
{"text":"I stopped in here for lunch this week and had the Chicken Massaman Curry dish.  It was delicious....made to order and very fresh.  The service was very friendly and it was a great visit.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"Massamam is very flavorful and tasty, for price was expecting larger rice portion that other places have in this range."}
{"text":"Decent spot to grab lunch with an intimate setting. Not the best Thai food I have had, but definitely not the worst. The ingredients seem to be fresh and of good quality. My only complaint with my experiences here is they do not allow you to make many substitutions, ie., fried rice in lieu of white or brown rice is not allowed unless you want to order a family size of the friend rice with your entree. Our server has always been super friendly and very accommodating, and with a sense of humor."}
{"text":"Well this may be my love of Thai food getting the best of me but I don't think so. THis place is tops. For being located in a strip mall the interior space is really nice. The place is on the smaller side but it has a cozy upscale feeling that you usually don;t get from anything in a strip mall, they are next door to Marc's so yeah it's that kind of strip mall.   Food is great. Last night I had one of the spicier curries with shrimp. Delicious. My Fiance had the pineapple chicken which I was a bit jealous of. You know I love when you can tell fruit like pineapple was cut fresh and not from a can. The only think I could say about the food I could say about most asian places, the spicy could be spicier, but I love hot hot food so that is what it is.  Service was great as well."}
{"text":"The WORST service I have ever gotten!! Ordered for delivery and took 2 hours to get our food, we live less then 5 minutes away. Once we got our food, my lo mein was tasteless and barely had any noodles, food was luke warm at best. Definitely won't be going back ever again"}
{"text":"Nice small little Thai restaurant. The food is spicy as expected but very good. Would come back."}
{"text":"A very solid choice for Thai food in Pittsburgh.  Family-run, reasonable prices, good food.  The noodle dishes I have sampled so far--Pad Thai, Chiang Mai Mee, and the spicy Tom Yum noodle soup (which, let me tell you, is a truly amazing hangover cure) have all been excellent.  Some of the appetizers I've had here haven't been the best, but overall you can expect solid quality from the entrees.  They often have candy and fruit for you to take with you when you leave!  And the staff is generally very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Thai Gourmet, and after seeing the 4 star reviews, I was intrigued to try it! I must say, the atmosphere was warm and inviting. That being said the food was off key for me. I am a huge lover of thai food, and quite honestly not that particular with what I get. I have a few go to favs, chicken tom yum soup being at the top of the list. The soup here was overly salty, not overly tangy because I do love that. It tasted like a huge handful of salt was accidentally (or maybe not) added to it and made it difficult to finish it through. Not to mention the chicken tasted rather old and not fresh what so ever which was a HUGE downfall. I did also try the chicken satay, and I will say this was crispy and cooked well, tasted fresh, and had good dipping sauces along side it. I don't know if it was just a bad batch of chicken in the soup or what, but it was not good.  For my entree, I got the mala string green beans with shrimp added to it. Both tasted like they had been sitting in the freezer for too long, and not fresh at all and it really ruined the meal for me. And for an extra $4.00 for added shrimp that tasted frozen and not fresh?!? That is absurd.   The service was also okay. Our waitress was nice and tended well to us but definately looked like she was ready for us to be out of there so she can get home. I can't blame her cuz it was towards the end of the day, but I do have to say it turned me off a little. Because of this, and the nice atmosphere, I gave it 2 stars. It was the food that made it take more of a hit."}
{"text":"Thai Gourmet is in a strip mall with a Marc's and some sort of chain restaurant called Beef O'Bradys, whatever the heck that is. Because of its location, I never had high hopes for it to be any good, but I'll tell you - it totally is.  My personal favorite is the yellow curry, when it's done properly. My biggest complaint about this place is its inconsistency. Sometimes the bamboo shoots are so tough that you can't chew them. Sometimes the chicken is grissley. Sometimes the curry itself is bland. But when it's good, it's really good. All of the curries are nice, and the steamed vegetable dumplings are great. The egg rolls are very good and very big. The service has always been very pleasant, and it's always very clean.  My other complaint is that it's a little pricey for how inconsistent the food is. If I knew that it was going to be great every single time, I'd never blink at the bill. It's not expensive by any means - $40 will get you two meals, an appetizer and drinks. But for the risk that you're taking with whether or not the food will be as expected, I feel the the prices could be lower.  If you're in the Stow area & want a decent curry, take the risk. Just maybe ask for it without bamboo shoots."}
{"text":"This place is so tiny you might never notice it tucked into a tiny storefront on Liberty. But sometimes those hidden spots are hidden gems, and this is seriously one of those places.  I worried when I tried to call in our order and got a message that the mailbox was not in service. After double and triple checking the number, I actually thought the place must have gone out of business, except there were reviews from just a week or two ago. I decided to walk over and check it out, and am glad I did. The place was pretty busy for a random Sunday evening, but the take out was made quickly, and was some of the best Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. The peanut sauce with the summer rolls was everything I wanted it to be, my partner's prik noodles were awesome, and my red curry was fiery and delicious. This place will take your heat requests seriously - order a ten at your own (and your intestines') risk. We'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Review?! Pfffffff.... Just know that Chicago is the mecca of my taste buds and out here in AZ, it's really hard to please. Thai food is not the same to other restaurants.  We travel over 30 miles just to have the best Thai food!  We ordered the egg rolls, chicken satay (peanut sauce is to fit for), drunken noodles, and panang curry!  #DOIT"}
{"text":"I reviewed the other Thai Gourmet years ago and didn't make the connection.  This is not Thai food. This is more like Chinese cooked with some Thai seasonings and sauces.  The pad thai did not have the right flavor, my beef noodle soup was ok, but lacked the normal condiments, the beef salad was not even close to Thai beef salad, and they use that weird Chinese takeout meat mix.  We even asked for a dish to be made \"Thai style\" and the waitress did not understand or try to figure it out.  My rating is based on this restaurant's claim of serving Thai food and my expectation of it.  The curry wasn't too pad so I added a star. Perhaps I would have rated it higher if I wanted and was expecting Chinese food."}
{"text":"First let me say, I am half-thai and grew up on authentic Thai food and have also had Thai food in Thailand restaurants, as well as from street vendors.  This restaurant is more Chinese than Thai.  They used some Thai ingredients in the dishes, but the dishes are not authentic. To be fair, I only had the pad-see-ew, but it was nothing like thai pad-see-ew (even compared to other Thai restaurants here in Cleveland).  The pad-see-ew had green peppers and other veggies in it that are not in authentic pad-see-ew.  Also, it also had a strong soy sauce flavor....although Thai pad-see-ew is made with soy sauce, it's not the regular Kikoman-type of soy sauce.  The beef was the Chinese style beef-mixture, if you know what I mean....it doesn't quite taste like beef.  To sum it all up, this place isn't authentic. Come here if you want Chinese fusion, but not real Thai food."}
{"text":"Awesome service, delicious food, & yummy Thai Tea! It's definitely a little spot that I'll be back to."}
{"text":"I went last night and take home my order so far the food was amazing. If you guys want asian food, this place you can go and the stuff are nice.5 min from home that pluz for me i'll come back very soon"}
{"text":"Let me add.....something about those who rate by pure taste of food or one thing or another and everything else is disregarded confuses me.  First off, the Thai food is not the bestest of the world.....but........its pretty dang good for being where its located, for the price, for the conveniance, for the friendly service and clean restaurant and reasonable expediated food times.  It hits all of that.  Is it compared to the best Thai restaurant I've eaten? Never because I knew that going into that.  Its got its own unique and delicious taste on some of the things Im used to ordering.  Tom ga kai; mussaman, etc.   all delicious.  This is a great Thai place with great service and food.    If people could quit comparing silly things....errrr...Thai tea wasnt icey enough.....3 stars....errrrrrr.....Its near an auto repair shop hidden behind a mexican sandwich shop....3 stars....errrrr.....not the best thai food and ive been to bankok.....errrrr... shush it already and rate on everything all together....you know, like service, food, ambiance, conveniance, etc. etc."}
{"text":"The BAD.  I was hit by two negative perceptions immediately as I walked through the door into the dining room.  First, the less than appealing odor of used, hot frying oil.  Second, there was absolutely no décor,  Zip, nada.  The only thing on the walls was paint.  The only way to describe this place is stark, barren and PLAIN.  It did, however, appear to be clean.  Now the GOOD.  It was the first time in over 10 years I've had great Massaman curry.  The chef undercooked the potatoes and they were pretty hard, but the Massaman curry sauce was exceptional, possibly the best I have ever had.  The portion was substantial.  I left very satisfied.  It is rare that I find a restaurant that I want to go back to.  I'll probably go back next week.  I'm excited about trying the other curry dishes and the pad Thai.  My dining partner had the fried rice.  It was average or slightly better.  I wouldn't order it again but the Massaman curry, WOW!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite lunch spots for work along Rockside Rd... I always get the Pad Thai with the right amt of spice, depending how I'm feeling that day.  Also a fan of their Hot & Sour Soup. Service is usually pretty quick. It's pretty small inside, if you go right at noon you may have to wait for a table to open up. I go 1130a or 1p and typically sit right down."}
{"text":"Had a Pad Thai dish for lunch that was just OK.   I was looking for peanuts on top of dish - none of that. I ordered it spicy - and it came out just right. The seating is cramped, but the service was quick, and the servers were on the ball. I always have a concern when Thai places include Chinese dishes on the menu. I don't like a fortune cookie after my Pad Thai."}
{"text":"No rice included with our meals.  Poor quality food.  Pickup order.  When we returned no apology was offered.  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"Small, quaint little place with the sweetest of servers. I'm not sure her name, but our waitress was so kind and genuine. I really wanted to tip her well beyond my means. She was so happy in every aspect of her job, I felt like a My Big Fat Greek Wedding type of movie could be filmed here. And the food was great too! Eating out is an experience beyond the actual food and this place delivers."}
{"text":"Tried calling to place a take-out order, recording said they were busy to call back. Walk to the restaurant to order and they were closed, no signs on the door or anything indicating why. Who knows when they're even open? If they are."}
{"text":"What a little gem!    We ordered takeout (for 13) one night while visiting family in Stow.  I admit that based on nothing but stereotype (with possibly a hint of Boulder foody snobbishness), I wasn't expecting a combo Thai/Chinese restaurant in little old Stow to wow me.  I'm hear to tell you just how wrong I was.  Coconut soup?  Delicate, well spiced with the right amount of sweet.  Panang Curry?  Just the right twang in my mouth.  It could have been a bit spicier, but I have only myself to blame for that (having been burned once too often with even MILD dishes, I tend to be pretty cautious...)  AND I loved that they made this with tofu even though that wasn't an option on the menu.  Thai Dumplings?  Positively addictive.  I added a good solid half inch to my waistline with these...  Pad Sew?  Way to go Thai Gourmet!  And to top it all off, there wasn't one error in our order full of special requests.  And it was ready on time.  And hot.  If you are a Stow-area local, don't hesitate to try out this great little Thai/Chinese joint!"}
{"text":"Delicious and reasonably priced! Definitely plan on going here again, and will recommend this place to friends!"}
{"text":"Their entrees are just okay to me. Everything seems to have the same sauce even when I order different dishes. The pad Thai is mediocre at best. The wait staff is usually great and the food comes out quickly. They have a sweet rice dessert that is to die for so I go back just for dessert. I don't really eat dinner there anymore."}
{"text":"I ordered the Masaman curry with Tofu & my gf ordered the Pineapple chicken fried rice. Mind you I have been to tons of Thai restaurants and curry never gets boring. I love how every place does it a little differently and I can certainly appreciate the uniqueness of flavors. Thai gourmet did not disappoint. The food was absolutely delicious! Service was just OK, not bad but not super attentive. I also like servers to know the answers to some questions about the food but my server seemed very unsure. I'd be ok with a simple \"I'm not sure, let me check\" but this never occurred to her so I didn't order the appetizer. Just a tip that some of the staff might need better training but otherwise absolutely delicious food. Will definitely want to check them out maybe for lunch as they have a lot of nice variety."}
{"text":"Don't let the strip mall part scare you. This place is really good!  This is one of the best thai places in the Akron area. The food is affordable, staff is always friendly and their delicious Massaman curry keeps me coming back for more. I drive out of my way frequently to feed my Massaman addiction. I also appreciate that when I ask to have my meal made spicy they do not try to scare me away from spicy or bring me out food with little to no spice. I get exactly what I order each and every time."}
{"text":"This -might- be a 4 star because of its nostalgic value to me. It was the first place I ever had Thai food as a high schooler with one of my high school best friends and it's still there! And looks just like I remember it. The food has always tasted good and prices are reasonable. Really not much to complain about. Yes, it's in a strip mall and isn't very big, but it's nicely decorated. Service is friendly and laid back."}
{"text":"This is better than 4 stars but not quite 5.  Many choices on the menu combined with generous portions and different flavors and reasonable prices make this a great everyday meal. This place is small and somewhat unkempt, so we go there for there for the food not the atmosphere.  The Japanese eggplant stir fry with either duck or tofu is my favorite, but everything I have tasted is fine.  BYOB"}
{"text":"The name truly does justice to its cuisine. Ordered the spicy peanut curry (with tofu) along with a coconut ice cream, and both did not fail to impress with regards to the quality as well as the quanitity offered.   I requested the curry to be extra spicy, which blended well with the flavour and taste and was not just a spicy dish filled with chillies. After savouring this dish, I had no room left for a second offering so chose to opt for the ice cream instead.   The ice cream had a nice tinge of coconut to it and was not heavy on the cream/milk making it a good palate cleanser. In addition to this, the decor and friendly employees force me to visit again to try out yet another spicy curry!"}
{"text":"I'm trying to love this place but it's really hard to.  PROS: -It's close to where I live. -Their curry tastes authentic. -They have a spice tray.  CONS: -Pad Thai was dry AF. Bleh.  -Curry portion is small compared to other restaurants. -They don't put eggplant, bamboo, or potato in their panang curry. -If you want to add tofu to a curry with (chicken, beef, pork) Your new total will be $16. (This is overpriced in my opinion) -Female worker rushed my order on the phone. -They don't have chicken thighs. Only chicken breast which is drier.  In conclusion, this is not my 1st choice if I'm craving Thai food. I'd rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the variety the menu offers but not so much the staff :/ Every single time I visit, I get the same exact waitress- in fact, she seems to be the only waitress employed. She is not horrible, but literally  forgets at least one item off of my order every single time!!! Idk, why she wont use a pad & pen & old school it just like everyone else? But she somehow magically remembers to charge you for the forgotten item.  So, I ordered out one night & asked for my noodle dish not to have onions in it (onions are like listening to a republican speak- just leaves a bad taste in your mouth & a horrible ache in your heart). It was somewhat my fault, I didn't bother to check my food before I left... but I got home & there were onions in my food. Took the noodle dish back & was completely ignored. Although I was the only person at the register, apparently the cashier had their head so far up their butt they couldn't see or hear me! But anyways, the waitress was very rude and almost accusatory/defensive. And acted like I was lying about having onions in my food, she then got mad at me when I asked if I could exchange the noodles for their spicy wonton instead & do an even exchange. She took my noodles back to the kitchen & then came out with an even more annoying attitude, saying that the chef didn't see any onions in my food & asked if I could point them out- are you f***ing kidding me!!!! So I got ticked off, opened a fork & pulled out an onion, she then said it doesn't look like an onion to her and continued to argue with me.  When I finally got my spicy wontons instead she then continued with the attitude because the wontons were cheaper & it was too difficult for her to give me the money they owed me. You know what the difficult part was- me not stabbing my fork in her eye!  My boyfriend & I haven't been back since but go to their sister restaurant in Hudson- the food & service is better."}
{"text":"Really good red curry. I loved it!!  Only recommendation to others is order mild  because I ordered medium and it was pretty spicy."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and every meal I've ordered has been excellent. The environment is relaxed and the service is always honest and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb for lunch. They have a huge variety of options that only $7. The  lunch specials come with lemongrass or wonton soup and a spring roll. I recently had the green curry chicken with rice and the portions are huge! Even for lunch we all had left overs. I got a spice level of 5 and thought that was the right amount for a bit of heat but not too overpowering. The green curry was very flavorful and not too thick. My only complaint was the chicken was a little dry. I also am a fan of their thai spicy basil fried rice. Definitely recommend for lunch as you can't beat the price for the amount of food they give."}
{"text":"Had a ridiculous lay over in Phoenix so I got a chance to check this place out. Everything we had, super taste. I am very partial about my Penang curry, pretty much there's only a few places that do it right, and this places is one of them! So tasty! The mango curry was also great and the Thai fried rice was delicious. Totally worth going off my low carb diet for a day"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Love coming here!  House noodles are my favorite but anything on the menu is great."}
{"text":"Updating my review to 5 stars because I've now tried multiple items on their menu and am always so happy with the quality and the quantity for very reasonable prices. Take out is really quick service - they usually have our order ready within 15 minutes! My favorites on their menu are vegetable yellow curry and vegetable Pad Thai. Ordering vegetarian items at restaurants can sometimes be disappointing, but not here - the veggies come loaded with all my favorites. Thai Gourmet is definitely worth a visit! Or change up your take out game and give them a shot."}
{"text":"The ambience is very relaxing ,food is delicious I had the number 23 , my friends had shrimp and vegetables soo good both of them. The fresh coconut was delicious, the sticky rice and mango very good.I will comeback"}
{"text":"This place, it looks like it might be scary since it's in a strip mall, but don't miss it!  It's small, maybe seats 30 people max, but the food is all made to order, the hot and sour soup is to die for, and they have so many great options for all sorts of eaters.  The service is also fantastic, I've been up in Cleveland 3 times in the last year, and each time I eat here."}
{"text":"This place makes me feel like I'm in NYC.  The outside and ambiance aren't anything special or spectacular but the food is unbelievably good.  I strongly recommend the Thai Style Fried Rice.  The yellow curry and cashew tofu were also very tasty.  I normally don't review places that have over 20 reviews but I figured I had to give a shout out to the vegans / vegetarians.  The tofu is really tasty and if you order the fried rice with tofu they automatically leave out the egg.  Lots of other options available for vegans.    The parking is street only.  Credit Cards are accepted.  Good place to bring a date or a group of friends for a casual yet tasty meal."}
{"text":"I ordered the Tom Kha Thai Hot and let me say, definitely the BEST coconut curry I have ever had. The young girl at the front was so nice. Definitely deserves more than 5 stars."}
{"text":"I had this amazing curry at a different restaurant and I was raving about it to all my friends, most of them just smiled and said \"oh really?\" But the REAL Thai food lovers all recommended me to try Thai Gourmet. My one friend, who was born and raised in Thailand told me that TG is the most authentic, best Thai in Pittsburgh; usually when I have THAT high of expectations t's usually not up to par BUT TG blew me out of the water. The food? Oh my goodness gracious... My friends and I ordered summer rolls as an appetizer, Pad Thai, another noodle dish, and panang Curry with a side of Tom Yum soup and fried spring roll. Let me ask you, how can EVERYTHING be SO EXCEPTIONAL? I was shocked of the deliciousness level of every single item.. I felt like a queen. My friends and I (who were all first TG timers) all agreed that this is the best Thai restaurant in Pgh AND the best Thai we've ever had. The staff was so kind and considerate. Prices were very fair, this place has me sold I'm a regular now!!"}
{"text":"I've tried many Thai food throughout  my life and I can say this place is the best when it comes to their curry and papaya  salad. Last night my fiancee took me out to dinner, I was craving  for good thai food not knowing he would  take me here. Little place in a shopping  center in Avondale hidden in the corner, nothing fancy. The food speaks for itself, authentic  thai food made fresh. I'll be back,  just be patient because it takes time to make. We tried the parag with chicken curry, Thai papaya salad with shrimp, pad thai with combination  of chicken and beef, volcano chicken, and must-have sticky rice."}
{"text":"I am so glad I checked this place out!  My faith in Pittsburgh's ethnic food restaurants has been restored and I'm not even kidding.  I hate always bringing up the fact that I'm from the West Coast and I've had good ethnic food, but it's such a bummer when I try to eat out in Pittsburgh and I'm so disappointed.  Luckily it did not happen this time.    First off, the decor and ambiance were great.  The restaurant was clean, well-lit, non-pretentious and even had cloth napkins!  The menu was extensive and they had plenty of vegetarian options.  My friend and I ordered the tofu spring rolls as an appetizer.  They were very tasty and fresh.  For dinner we ordered a couple of curries and we weren't disappointed.  The sauces were creamy, slightly sweet, slightly spicy and totally delicious.  The portions are HUGE and we both ate way too much.  We had no complaints about the service either.  Overall, I would recommend this place to everyone...even my fellow West Coast emigrants.  Come here with an appetite because you'll need it!"}
{"text":"I visited this quaint little place and can say hands down it's the best Thai food I've had in the valley.  The waitress was very helpful in answering our questions and giving recommendations.  This is the first thai restaurant that offered laos style papaya salad,  a big thumbs up in my book! Everything was amazingly delicious from the salad to the dessert. This is going on the list of favorites for sure!"}
{"text":"Delighted to see a new Thai place in the SW Valley, especially when it received many great Yelp reviews.  Completely disappointed with our first visit.  The 2 stars is, as Yelp states \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"  That pretty much sums up our feeling about what we tasted.  We didn't hate it nor were we completely grossed out by the food, it just left us entirely unimpressed.  As my husband said \"There is nothing distinct about any of the flavors, it just isn't exciting.\"  We had no complaints about the service and we certainly wish them well, as we prefer to support local businesses, but we hope the food quality will improve.  We called in takeout for one order of egg rolls, one Pad Kee Moa (Drunken Noodles) with beef, medium spicy and one Kaeng Peg (Red Curry) with chicken, medium spicy.   The gal who took the phone order was very friendly, as were the counter staff when we picked up.  Arriving home, we were anxious to dig in.  The egg rolls may have suffered slightly from sitting in styrofoam for the 15 minute drive back home.  The wrappers seemed a bit greasy.  The pork filling, although tasty, was almost too densely packed, it was more like a giant pork meatball encased in the wonton.  When I used to work in Tempe, one of our regular lunch choices was either Thai Basil or Thai Elephant (University locations).  Thai Elephant in particular, is the standard to which I judge all red curry here in AZ. As my old carpool friend used to say \"I could drink the red curry sauce.\"  In comparison, I found Thai Gourmet's much thinner and lacking the pronounced coconut milk flavor I've come to crave.  There were also some grease spots floating on the top of the broth.  Further, this red curry appeared to contain nothing but tiny pieces of chicken and onions, whereas Thai Elephant's is chock full of large pieces of chicken and perfectly cooked broccoli, zucchini, bell pepper, baby corn, carrots, mushrooms and onions.  In Thai Gourmet's version, I finally found a couple small pieces of baby corn and thin slices of bell pepper sunken to the bottom of the bowl.  My husband may be a bit jaded by a recent visit to another Thai place during a business trip to eastern Washington, but he too was disappointed by his Drunken Noodles.  He said they just didn't have the depth of flavor that he's come to expect in good Thai food.  As another reviewer commented, the noodles were broken in small pieces.  The vegetables were skimpy cuts and slightly overcooked.  Perhaps the regular chef called in sick or was training someone new.  Considering any place can have an off night, we may give them one more chance, but this time just split the pad thai and see how they do with that old standby.  Then, if we are again disappointed, at least it will have been a more economical experiment (I hate wasting dollars from our restaurant budget on mediocre food, but I guess at least it makes us appreciate the gems out there all the more)."}
{"text":"Family-owned and operated, the ambiance is much better than down the street at Thai Cuisine. But the dishes are still quite good for a family restaurant and they can also make things REALLY spicy."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot at beginning, but now that I've gone back the food taste different. My husband and I both feel the same way. I also feel the price is a little high and the portions very small. I think $2.99 for a side of rice that comes in a little bowl is too high. Sorry that I feel this way now."}
{"text":"I look forward to our date nights at Thai Gourmet. It's a must to start off with Thai tea. And the spicy wonton are a delightful spicy, garlicky appetizer (or meal if you're not very hungry.) My favorite dish is the Cornish hen. I don't know what kind of magic they weave into their curry sauce, but it's delectable.  And the coconut ice cream for dessert...can you say YAAS!!  I find it enjoyable to have a small place, where you can enjoy an intimate dining experience and not be overwhelmed by dozens of other diners. The food speaks loud enough for itself, without having to fight for your attention from raucousness.   Like things spicy, maybe more so than the average American? Just tell them you want it spicy! Oh boy, you will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a couple years;  food is still very good, but service is so-so.   My boyfriend's entree was served almost 5 minutes before mine.  We asked for coffee after our meal and was told that the machine was broken."}
{"text":"Our new thai food favorite. The owner has been here every time and is just so cheery, pleasant and hospitable.  The food is delicious and more than fairly priced. My recommendation would be their pan ang curry, which is just the right amount of sweet. To top it all off the thai teas here come with free refills."}
{"text":"My friend and I went to eat there for the first time I had order the red curry ck n the egg rolls the food were tasty n good. My friend had order pad Thai ck n the papaya salad (laos style) she say that was also very tasty. Finally at the end of our meal we both had order mango sticky rice n that were very delicious and the bomb!! The staffs were very friendly n great service even the owner came out n talk to us.. How generous of her! If ya like to eat Thai food this is a great place to start!! We for sure will be back.."}
{"text":"The food was good here. Hot is a bit hotter than hot. I cant imagine what thai hot would be and i love spicy food. I had the beef laab salad and it was good. I also had the fresh spring rolls. They could use some crunch from sprouts. The sauce was more like a plumb sauce, i prefer peanut sauce.   My place mat was dirty probably from the previous guest. All in all i would come back and try other things. Just maybe not the spring roll because ive had better, maybe this is a good source of constructive critisism, something to improve on.   The beef laab was great though. So was the service."}
{"text":"Found out about Thai Gourmet from Yelp. Based on the reviews was looking forward to it, needless to say my friend and I were not disappointed. While overlooking the menu our eyes got bigger than our stomachs :) We ordered the Pho (they allowed me to sub the beef for chicken), combination fried rice, & Shrimp w/chicken pad thai NOW I wanted a tad spicy but didn't know what I was in for when I ordered it. The flavor of the pad thai was so delicious that despite I was guzzling down water to fight the heat I didn't want to stop. The waitress was very kind and even offered if I wanted them to remake the dish for me. So if you like a little spice be sure to caution them exactly what you can handle. They had good food, decent prices and amazing service, I know they recently opened so I just hope they continue to maintain this level of service."}
{"text":"This may be my favorite restaurant I have ever been to. Not really because of the food. It was pretty good. I had the pumpkin curry. It was good. The atmosphere of the restaurant was just so pleasant and a welcome departure from the Polish joint across the street. I think I am going to stop my elitist beliefs on Polish people. I think that I am most at home at a place like this. It was nice and quiet. Awesome decorations including some Thai General or some kind of military figure. There was a cartoon of a boy and girl with folded hands that appeared to be in love. I was giving up on the entire concept of pair bonding and love until I saw that adorable picture. The atmosphere of Thai Gourmet was so grounded and peaceful. A complete juxtaposition with that weird bar next door. I am glad that they didn't serve alcohol at this restaurant. I am really starting to get pissed off at alcohol and all the evil it encourages, creates and perpetuates. This place had so many cute special touches that made it a unique restaurant. That is what I love about supporting family owned and operated places and not chains. It made me think about the place across the street that was being filmed for Restaurant Impossible. All he does is come into a place that has created their own version of what their restaurant should be and destroys that vision. He changes it to what society as a whole deems as beautiful and acceptable. I think it should be the other way around. As it is in Thai Gourmet."}
{"text":"Good for farang Thai. The food is decent. I asked for as hot as they can make it and it didn't really do the job. They have most of the typical Thai-American dishes and all have been satisfactory. Independence is a weird name for this little town because there are not too many independently owned restaurants. It is all generic and corporate. They cater to the generic and corporate people that work around here. Maybe one day I will wear a stupid company logo polo shirt, get fat, eat at Panera everyday and drive a really nice car."}
{"text":"I have been to Thai Gourmet three times now... and this restaurant has earned its five-star rating over and over!  Service is always quick, eager to assist, and attentive.  Orders have always been taken and prepared accurately as ordered.  The Massaman curry is outstandingly outstanding!  The Tom Yum soup is \"good\" according to a fellow dinner companion.  And the Chicken Pad Thai has been a consistent all-star (and it's worth mentioning that it is not too sweet like this entree often is at other Thai restaurants)!  For dessert, be sure to order the mango and sticky rice -- a perfect ending to that spicy meal!  Consistent, reliable, and delicious... what more could you want?  When in the West Valley, go check out Thai Gourmet!  *****FIVE STARS*****"}
{"text":"Great food, the environment is small but comfortable. Just in case you are not a meat eater, this place also great for vegans, practically make anything there vegan. The Thai tea with soy milk was nice, just never try it with coconut milk, that was a bitter experience."}
{"text":"We get take out from here mostly, rather than dine in.  My favorite pad thai dish for sure.  And I can't resist the egg rol"}
{"text":"I have never hated a dish I've gotten here. If you want something spicy, you got it. At the same time, they can tailor your meal to be more or less spiced as you wish.  The service is attentive without being suffocating. The restaurant is small with intimate seating."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years, but won't be any more. The food and service only gets worse. I've had servers spill things on me and not even apologize. Most of the food is pre-cooked or made. It's basically the taco-bell equivalent of Thai food. You're better off making it yourself.  And even if you were willing to stay for the mediocre food because it might be easier than cooking at home, the staff and service aren't worth it. They're rude, not accommodating, and good luck getting their attention."}
{"text":"What a great place to eat. Yummy food, clean, fresh ingredients, and the service was A+. We had the Lo Mein noodles, house fried rice, sweet and sour chicken and pot stickers. Everything was delicious and I loves how fresh all the vegetables were in every dish. They even gave my 3 year old a quarter for the bouncy ball vending machine after he ate his rice and noodles. This is now our go to lunch."}
{"text":"First time eating at a Thai place--success! I had the thai fried rice and my fiance had the pad thai. Both were hot and delicious. We had plenty of leftovers to have a couple more meals out of it too! It's small, but they have places to sit and our server was very attentive."}
{"text":"Pho is bomb! Thai Hot veggie fried rice is amazing but they aren't lying about the hot! Great flavor."}
{"text":"Well first time here been looking for a good Thai place on the farther west side. At first impressions the restaurant is very clean but also empty that sometimes concerns me. I will say that the location is not the best I past it the first time and it is very small. Staff was very friendly and I ordered a Thai tea and she convinced me to add boba. I ordered the phad Thai and pot stickers as an starter. Tea was good but I like boba I know allot don't. I did think it was funny that either they had a tv or are getting a tv because only the mount and cables were on the wall.  Starter came very fast and they were not only plated awesome but tasted great. If left now we would be great. But then my phad Thai arrived now I have had this dish to many times to count and is always my go to dish. This is where we run into problems now I want to preface this by stating in no was this dish bad in anyway but I will say I ordered it mild so maybe that is why it was bland while eating it I kept thinking of spaghetti. But that being said I ate the whole dish. I will come back and try this place again. Let's see if they read the reviews and filter out the constructive post. On a side note I did think it was awesome that they had real wooden chop sticks."}
{"text":"Perfect spice level and a great taste. Also friendly service and a nice small atmosphere."}
{"text":"I had to give it the four stars because my wife loved her curry and I thoroughly enjoyed mine. I had the mango chicken curry and my wife had the pineapple chicken curry and both were well balanced in flavor. The sweetness from the fruit was perfectly offset by the spiciness and the coconut cream gave the curry a great texture. We also ordered the 'fresh rolls' aka spring rolls and they were good but nothing out of the norm. The young waiter was very polite and prompt."}
{"text":"Guys if you want Thai that will knock your socks off then you need to Bloomfield and be prepared for it to happen! The Pad Thai is my go to because holy moly it's delicious! I'm a spice level 5/6 kind of girl and they nail it. I've never had a bad experience here.  If you have friends coming to town, take them off the beaten path for a hot bite."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Been going here forever. Gnats everywhere. Wait staff and management didn't seem to care. Won't go back."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly. The food came out in a timely manner, and is well presented. Their curry played are full of meat and veggies! This our first time there and we had a great experience! If you are a Pho lover they also make that perfect! I tipped the cook!"}
{"text":"This is one our regular take out places after a long day at work. My favorite dish is the basil chicken. It can get rather spicy so I usually get a '3'.  The basil chicken is very flavorful and comes with white rice. It can easily be made into 2 meals and is very reasonable at ~$10. Their Kee Mao is also good.  When I'm in the mood, I'll get their spring rolls which aren't too heavy but still filling. Their chicken satay is a good 'healthier' option but not as flavorful or filling as one might like!  Ask for chili garlic sauce on the side if you want an extra kick. The staff is also very friendly and always greets you with a smile on their face."}
{"text":"I enjoy this restaurant. Very pleasant people. And more importantly, tasty food.  I always order masaman curry chicken from any Thai place. Their's is delicious.  Why not 5 stars? I'd prefer they skip the cabbage leaves in the curry. And the potatoes tend to be under-done (maybe par-boil them first, then finish them in the curry?)."}
{"text":"Yum yum! I wasn't feeling well and thought nothing could cure me better than some yummy coconut soup. Boy was I right! They coconut soup was soooooo good! Perfect spice (I asked for a blend of medium and mild) and had so many ingredients and lots of chicken! My boyfriend ordered the mango curry thanks to Yelp reviews and I wanna give a big shout out to all you Yelp-ers because we downed that baby and licked every last drop!! Soooooo good! Definitely added a new craving to my arsenal tonight with this gem of a find and will be ordering both dishes again for our next visit."}
{"text":"I'm gonna put it right out there.  The best Pad Thai I've ever had is at Spice Island in Oakland.  So whenever I go to a Thai restaurant, I have to compare it!  Please don't give me a hard time for ordering Pad Thai at every Thai place I go:)  IF I end up going somewhere twice, I promise I'll order something different...(kinda promise, okay?).  So...I ordered the Pad Thai.  It was okay, but nothing special.  I prefer my Pad Thai to have a rich peanut sauce and the sauce was pretty sparse on this one.  It did have plenty of sprouts, which is a plus for me though!  I also liked that the meal included soup (wonton or lemongrass) and an egg roll.  Love the extra perks!  Service was nice and quick with the total bill around $10 for everything, including the Jasmine tea I ordered.  I like a cheap meal, I just want a little more sauce!"}
{"text":"The absolute BEST thai food anywhere around! I've tried them all, and this will forever be my favorite. Their pad thai is a step above all of the other local options, and I have never tasted anything on their menu that wasn't a step below superb -- and I've tried plenty!"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of this restaurant. Definite hole in the wall family run operation. The service is great and the food is fresh and consistent. The portions are large - they don't skimp on meat and the prices are reasonable/cheap.  Of the appetizers I recommend siamese kisses, thai samosas, and satay chicken. Ive tried a few different curries (red, green, panang) and some noodle dishes. Nothing disappoints!! I always have left overs for lunch the next day.  The girls that run this place really know what they are doing. I am eating a take out order right now and wrote this review solely due to the surprise homemade brownie they gave me with my chicken red curry. My meal is delicious, even though I ordered a 6 and my mouth is burning - fire or not, this dish has tons of flavor. The brownie is gooey and delicious too!"}
{"text":"Well let me start with the fact that they offer a 15% military discount. The owners are very friendly as well as the staff. The tea was probably the best I've ever had and the spring rolls were amazing. I had the panang curry which was amazing and a good sized portion. My husband ordered the drunken noodles which was also great. The food came out hot and in a timely manner. We ordered the spring rolls which come in three per order which I think is a odd number (literally) because unless you are in a group of three or alone someone is going to lose out on a roll. The location is not ideal but I think the food and staff make it worth the trip. We will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Today was my day off and I kidnapped my friend to come dine-in with me.  Our bill came out to be $31.01 for an appetizer, two entrees, and some full bellies!  Here's the break-down:  Laab:  I've never ordered laab before and I'm beginning to wonder why I wasn't shown the light earlier.  The \"meat salad\" as described on the menu actually had tripe!  I was pleasantly surprised and it was tasty!  I'm not sure if I was eating it right but I ate it like a lettuce cup appetizer.  Hey, if I see little leaves of lettuce and giant slices of cucumbers, I *will* use it!  Anyways, the flavors were amazing --- the lemongrass made every bite fragrant, the kaffir leaves gave it deep subtle notes, and the mild chili spice allowed for you to taste the yummy tripe mixture.  Although once I ran out of lettuce, things got a bit too salty but it's nothing a little rice can't help diffuse.  I'm so thirsty though!  Massaman Curry Combination:  Massaman curry is my favorite.  I think potatoes and curry are soulmates.  They're Ken and Barbie, Clark Kent and Lois Lane, a Pop Danthology mashup!  They just belong together!  Anyways, the curry came out in a giant bowl of steamy wonderfulness complete with a radish flower garnish.  The tofu was little blocks of yumminess, the potatoes just melts in your mouth, the carrots added some bites of sweetness, and the curry was so dang tasty.  I could've ate the whole dang thing if I didn't have the appetizer and the other entree to eat from.    Pad Phrik Prow Combintion:  This was also a new dish for me.  I've never had it before so maybe I'm not the best person to ask but it was delicious!  It had good flavor and anything with baby corn makes me a happy happy girl.  The portion seemed a bit small compared to the curry though but I still found myself having to get a doggy bag for this dish (and the other two too!).  Overall I had a lovely late-lunch at Thai Gourmet.  I apologize for making such a mess.  My fork kept falling out of the rice bowl...  Let me blame the bowl and save what little dignity I have left.  T_T  Service was friendly, restaurant was clean, and food was served in a timely manner.  I also like how they're right by Purcell so I can spend my time creeping on my friend who works there (Big Brother is watching!).  Anyways, Thai Gourmet comes highly recommended.  I think I want to try the Mango Curry and the Tom Kha the next time I'm in.  I regret saying that I forgot my leftovers in my friend's car and now I'll be depressed for the rest of the night.  Excuse me while I play some Coldplay.   Oh yeah, the waiter was kinda cute too.  :)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing and great service we have tried a lot of Thai places and this by far our favorite"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical off all of the 5 star reviews, but I don't think I set the bar too high for my first visit to Thai Gourmet.  The service was good and the food was good.  It was my first experience with lemongrass soup, which unfortunately isn't my thing, but I was looking forward to my pad kee mow, which was tasty and spicy.  I went with the 4 stars instead of the typical 5 because it didn't make my list of favorite Thai food.  I will be sure to check it out again and make sure my review still applies.  The lunch specials have a decent variety and the dishes are reasonable, so I'll be here again sometime."}
{"text":"Yummy Thai food in a very casual atmosphere.  The eating area is very small, but takeout is quick and easy. I keep going back for more because it's so darn delicious!"}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE!  I've never had a bad meal here. The salt and pepper squid is to die for. Awesome spring rolls,  too. But the curry is so fantastic. Tried many types. They are all great."}
{"text":"Still the best Thai in Pittsburgh. Their lunch special usually comes with a treat or dessert I always look for. This week was mini egg rolls so crispy."}
{"text":"I had the pad thai shrimp and chicken combo and mango curry with white rice (split between two people ) My mother had the laad.   First of all the pad thai no peanuts combo was amazing I've always gone to the thai orchard garden and have had thai basil but this place set a higher bar than both! the fresh lime was something I've never thought of.  The mango curry-medium spice was heaven on earth especially with the white rice! Lastly the Laad yes, I stole a few bites from moms plate. I'm a HUGE texture eater so I was pretty hesitant. the flavor was spicy and flavorful..you will not loose any flavor from the spice. Portion was more than generous and if you run out of lettuce and cucumbers try it with rice!   Ok I guess I'm not done. To top off this hidden treasure I tried the mango sticky rice dessert all I can say is OMG!! 50 cents quote \"I love you like a fat kid loves cake\" is no more insert now \" I love you like a fat kid loves mango sticky rice!\""}
{"text":"It is impressive to have Thai food this bland.  I do not have any understanding of what other people on this page could possibly be experiencing.  Go to Thai Cuisine.  Or if it is Monday and they are closed, Smiling Banana Leaf."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been here sooner. The food was delicious. We started with the Thai Rolls...they had chicken in them, the texture threw me off a little bit but they were good! I got the Shrimp Pataya...it was exactly what I had hoped for. It comes with a delicious spicy Thai sauce...but not TOO spicy! My boyfriend had Fried Rice with chicken, shrimp and beef. He liked my food so much that he asked for a bowl of the Spicy Thai sauce on the side for his meal hahaha. The place is very intimate...it holds probably about 30 people. We were thrilled and we will be back here."}
{"text":"Ok.just got done eating my take out . 1 . I got Laab for appetizer it way to salty .and I thought  was it supposed to be sour not salty. 2 . Pah Thai tofu its ok . 3 Pa Nang beef once again too much salt .the flavor is not to bad .  I definitely will give it anoyher try next time . May have to ask them not to put to much salt ."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why everyone is so down on this restaurant, I've been here twice and each time I've enjoyed the experience.  I came here on a weekday during dinner time and it was relatively quiet. The waitress was very attentive and professional, plus the food was pretty good! What alway surprises me the most is the location... from the outside it doesn't look like much, I think because it's located in a busy shopping plaza. But when you first walk in you will notice that it's dark, quiet and kind of fancy.   I'm not going to say its a \"5 star - mind blowing\" restaurant, but it's certainly worth visiting."}
{"text":"I stopped in to place an order to-go. After being ignored completely by the lady struggling to find keys on the register, another lady walks up with someone's to-go order and asks if I am there to pick up a to-go order. I respond that I need to place an order and that I also need a menu. The first lady interrupts and barks \"the menus are right here\" (hidden behind another customer).  The menu is about 5 pages long, it has too many thai variations and too many chinese variations.  The prices vary depending on what time of day it is. I can only assume the portion sizes do too.  After browsing the giant menu to make a choice the staff had completely disappeared. Thats when I noticed the dining atmosphere. Poorly lit! Made me glad I was there for take-out.  Finally a young kid walks up from the back and I asked if he could place my order. He seemed unsure but said yes.  I ordered the vegetable dumplings from the appetizer section, a corn shrimp soup  and the General Tso's shrimp which was overpriced and came with less food than the wonton appetizer but cost 3 times as much.  The kid tells me the order will be ready in 15 minutes (it took about 12 to get someone to actually place the order). I walked around the neighboring shops to pass the time until it 'felt' like 15 minutes. When I went back the staff were all gone again! I started to look at my receipt to check what time it posted and it was now 30 minutes into the wait time! I finally got my overpriced unremarkable food and got out of there.  The dumplings fell apart as I ate a half at a time (they should be bite size). I did not even get my shrimp corn soup and the G-Tso's had decent shrimp but they were just caked in a sticky dark brown sauce.  I won't be back. They owe me my money back for the corn shrimp soup."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place. It's small, but service is pretty quick and the staff is nice.  They have a good selection of dishes on their menu.  This trip I got Pad Thai, which comes with shrimp and chicken. My lunch date got the Orange Chicken with a side of coconut rice at my suggestion.  He said there's a lot of inedible stuff in the dish.  There are quite a bit of orange peels and dried chili peppers. However, the chicken pieces were large and there was plenty of that to make him full.  For an appetizer, we got the salt and pepper shrimp. I highly recommend that.  It's pretty simple, fried shrimp with a blend of spices (brown sugar included) but it's always freshly made and delicious. If you go during lunch, just know that there are only about 15 tables and it gets busy. They do offer carryout though."}
{"text":"Terribly salty and oily. Didn't enjoy the food at all. The service was very efficient though."}
{"text":"First time here. Seen a five star on yelp so I had to try. Sure enough this place is goooood! Not only is the food good, but the staff a super friendly."}
{"text":"this place has an amazing vegetarian menu. am i vegetarian? no. i like to eat food. sometimes i really love tofu. and Thai Gourmet makes an amazing General Tso's Tofu. their crab rangoon is also great.  the thai part of their menu is great, too. actually, i've never had anything from here that wasn't fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A fresh, yummy non-franchise restaurant in the West Valley (Avondale)! I'm a fan!  The orders were extremely nice, welcoming. The restaurant was clean and cute. Ordered the Massaman curry & fresh rolls. FRESH & spicy & authentic! They have dine-in and carry-out.   They accept credit cards. The restaurant is located in a corner spot in a strip mall, but don't let that deter one from visiting. Fortunately, this place is w/in walking distance from my home and I will certainly be back, to sample other delish meals."}
{"text":"This place is bomb!!!! Staff was super friendly and had a great vibe. I asked for recommendations and am super glad that I did!! I got the mango curry with chicken. It was the best thing ever!!  Oh also I got the Thai tee and a raw coconut. The coconut water is possibly the best thing ever! I will definitely be back here."}
{"text":"One sentence description of my experience just in case you don't read the full review: this place serves amazing food with delicious flavors and one of my favorite Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh.   We were here for Friday dinner after an exhausting week. The place seemed to be busy but fortunately, we were able to find a table for 2 people immediately. The wait staff is very friendly and nice. They gave us ample time to look at the menu and place our order. One thing to remember when you visit this place is, they follow the spice levels sincerely. So, please know your spice level before you place order here.   We ordered chicken satay, Pad thai, and pineapple curry. The portion sizes are generous, and the plate is well made and organized. I will start with the chicken satay. They are generous portions of 6 chicken served over 6 sticks with peanut chutney and other veggies on the side. The chicken is well marinated and packed with subtle flavors. It is so juicy that I liked it just by itself with any peanut chutney. However, adding the peanut chutney just added another layer of flavor which made it even better. I highly recommend this dish.   We ordered Pad thai with breaded tilapia and spice level of 6. Usually, the add-ons at many other places are less in quantity. However, they added generous amount of tilapia to the Pad thai. Just the noodles with fried egg and tamarind sauce flavor is delicious and adding tilapia to it just elevated the dish to another level. We had enough to bring it back home for a late dinner!   Last, but not the least, pineapple curry which is served with a good bowl of rice and a spice level of 5. The dish looked so colorful and again generous quantity with a good number of pineapple chunks. I loved the soupy part of the dish which consisted of coconut flavor mixed with a bunch of other spices. Good quantity for one person if they are extremely hungry, but there will enough for a left over if you are someone with a small appetite.   Overall, great experience and great food with flavors that are on-spot. I highly recommend this place and it is good to dine alone, to go on a date, or to hang out with a bunch of friends. Also, they have take out which is also very popular."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great service and great people. I don't usually write reviews but I am a big foodie and love this place. Some dishes are as good as food in Thailand"}
