{"text":"Good service. Less than mediocre food and drinks. Hot food should be hot. Cold food should be cold. Drinks shouldn't taste watered down.  Much better places to eat in the area. I hope they get it together. The Smokehouse was awesome. We won't be going back and we're locals."}
{"text":"First off, this place reeks of urine! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. it was disgusting! The bread was soaked in grease, you couldn't pick it up like a sandwich even if you wanted! The pork meat was very mushy and not pleasant tasting at all!"}
{"text":"Save yourself the trip there. The ribs were so cooked that they were harder than the table top. They did nothing about it. The beef brisket was dry and tasteless. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I visit Phoenix 2-3 times a year and make it a point to stop in the Silver Spur for FRIED CHILI'S before I leave.  They are amazing, hands down.  I don't think they're on the menu now that it's changed from the Satisfied Frog; but you can ask for them, and you'll get them.  Because of my need for mass amounts of fried food I had the salad bar along with my chili's and was quite surprised at how good that was as well.  And....wasn't this the Silver Spur BEFORE it was Satisfied Frog?  Really it just changed back from what I've heard.  Any who...a must go for the not-so-much-a-tourist-anymore in me."}
{"text":"Went to Silver Spur yesterday to spend an \"authentic\" day in Arizona. Thought this would be a good place to eat. The waitress was very nice and turned out to be the best part of the entire experience. I asked for a suggestion between their version of a Philly Cheesesteak and a good burger. She said that she's had the cheese steak and there was plenty of meat on it and her favorite. I ordered it to my dismay. My husband order their Reuban. It took over 25 minutes for the meal to come out. His sandwich looked good (a triple decker) but the meat was cut into 1/4\"+ slices, so very difficulty to eat. He said that there wasn't much flavor in it even though it had sauerkraut, etc. The cole slaw was very dry. My food came and half the bun was empty, and the rest could not have been moved over to give me anymore than MAYBE a think slice of meat. I asked about the sandwich and \"Where was the GOOD AMOUNT of meat?\" She took it back and was told that this was the portions they give out. She offered to get me something else, but I declined figuring that NOW I had a taste for this. I began to eat....very grizzly, and COLD.They must have made it when the order came into the kitchen and let it sit there.  The fries were delicious.  However, when in town, we'll NEVER go to this place again!!!!"}
{"text":"We had family in town and wanted to eat across the street but there was a 2 hour wait so we found this place, which 10 years ago was really great as the Satisfied Frog. The place was pretty empty so we got a table. Service at first was great. Got drinks quickly. Few people ordered lemon aid and it was really watered down. Later we were told it was out of syrup. After we ordered dinner, my husband was told they were out of Ribeye so he settled for the sirloin. My Aunt ordered the lasagna, was told it was not available that night. She ended up ordering sirloin with stir fry vegetables. They were served raw. Steaks had very little seasoning. Baked potatoes had a dirt taste, like they weren't washed prior to baking. My sister ordered the Green Chili soup. Was horrible, looked like pur√©ed green mush and was sent back so she shared my sliders which were cold and the buns were hard. Meat was dry. Had to add BBQ sauce to choke down. Kids enjoyed their fries and burgers. Over all the kitchen didn't seem to have it together. Food was cold, not seasoned, very slow (took at least an hour to get order), and lacks desire to keep food items in stock. The waitress was very nice and apologetic. Won't go back unless things drastically improve. Which is sad. That location is so great."}
{"text":"Waited for seating while the lady was busy talking to customers seated. Had barbecue beef sandwich and wanted mashed potatoes however they were out of them? Had to tell waiter what side order we wanted he didnt ask thats when he said they had no mashed potatoes and no apology just walked away. The beef was terrible as was the barbecue sauce. Small baked potato and the cost of soda was $2.69 each. Total bill for two sandwiches $34.00 was not worth that much money. We will not go back there."}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with 3 friends and was very pleased. This was my 2nd visit to this restaurant, and I would return.  We had the Reuben sandwich, chicken quesedilla, Gobbler sandwich (turkey) and grilled cheese.  The 3 sandwiches all came with very tasty fries. The sandwiches were all huge, no scrimping here!  The prices were roughly $8.00 per entree, and judging from the size of the plate you receive, well worth the money.  They were very busy for a Tuesday lunch but there were plenty of staff, so we were well treated!"}
{"text":"I don't like to give bad reviews, but I was not happy. It was empty in there when we got there and all we wanted was a steak. We were then told that the grill was down. This was after we were seated and getting our drinks. This information would've been helpful to know before we were even seated. So we got the pulled pork (was ok) fried chicken (tasted like it was reheated and very greasy) chicken wrap (not good) kids Mac and cheese (tasted like reheated and my son wouldn't even eat it) kids hamburger (was ok). So all in all we ate because we were hungry but it wasn't worth it at all. The reason I'm writing this is because as we were getting ready to go we heard someone order the steak.... I thought the grill was down  This will be our first and our last."}
{"text":"Went to Cave Creek today to have some barbecue at the Smokehouse. We noticed that it is now the Silver Spur Saloon. From the moment we walked in, things were bad. We waited nearly 10 minutes to be seated, despite the fact that the place wasn't too busy. Our wings took forever and when they finally arrived, they were undercooked and lukewarm. We ordered the Silver Spur platter. The beans were ice cold and the meats were barely warm. The waitress sent it back and 5 minutes later returned with the same cold platter. How hard is it to serve a hot meal? We told her it was still cold and she offered to give us a free drink or desert. How about heating the food? After all, the platter was $30. We got a to-go box and waited an eternity for her to take our credit card so we could leave. If you like cold food, then this is the place for you. If you have nothing better to do than to hang around all day waiting to pay for overpriced cold food, then go to the Silver Spur. If you prefer to have a hot meal and attentive wait staff, steer clear of this place."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant occasionally for a years.  I really like the food, and the service is always good.  Last night, my friend and I had beef & pork ribs, and baked beans and coleslaw as sides.... which were good.  This place used to be called Satisfied Frog, and while their menu has trimmed down a bit, the dishes they serve up are tasty.  It's a casual place, and they keep in step with the Old West theme of Cave Creek.  I'll keep going back when I am in Cave Creek."}
{"text":"Went to the beer garden which is part of the Silver Spur Saloon for some happy hour. They seemed to have 75 cent Sam Adams till 4:30 for some reason? Sam Adams is crap so it doesn't matter. They have happy hour from 4-6 and have the usual 2$ domestics and $3.50 margarita which was quite tasty. The bar crowd was a mix of elders and cowboy types who looked like they could use a visit to the dentist and barber shop. They have free popcorn in the restaurant and usually have live music after 7. I enjoyed the band they had there on friday but unfortunately there were very few people there and they stopped at 9. Next time I go I will try the food, especially want to try that skillet baked chocolate chip cookie! P.S. Thursday after 6 is ladies night, happy hour prices all night for the females."}
{"text":"Well two quick issues: I came for the Brisket Lasagna, but they ran out or never had any (i got two different explanations). So, I decided to order the brisket sandwich, which they had, but I quickly regretted my decision upon sandwich arrival. I did ask if it was lean, but waitress was new and it clearly wasn't lean style. Tons of fat, pretty much could not eat anything and sent it back for good. Ended up with standard and safe choice of chicken wrap. There were also a few flies hanging out with us most of the meal. On a good note, the country potatoes were great with strips of onions and peppers and a bacon burger got a good review."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner this past weekend when my boyfriend and I were staying at The Boulders. He had fond memories of the Satisfied Frog and we decided to check it out despite the fact that I warned him about the poor Yelp reviews. Instead, we found the Silver Spur Saloon which seriously looked straight out of Disneyland. Clearly a tourist trap (I don't know what tourists would be doing in Cave Creek, but whatever), but I was hungry and here we were.  We had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table, which was odd because it didn't look very crowded. We had a drink at the bar - I had a T-something or other. It was really pretty good, like an Arnold Palmer made with a tea flavored vodka. After we were seated it took some time for our waiter to come around, he seemed really overwhelmed despite the fact that it didn't seem that busy. I had the chicken fried steak and the bf had prime rib. Now, I have to admit, I love salty food, but the food here was ridiculous. The batter on my chicken fried steak was super salty, as was the au jus which came with the prime rib. It was like licking a block of salt. My steamed veggies were also really mushy.   If I'm in the area again, I'm 99% sure I'd go elsewhere - not sure if there's anything in Cave Creek that isn't touristy and western themed though."}
{"text":"Silver Spur Saloon has replaced the now defunct Satisfied Frog, which I really liked. The difference? A new menu & they no longer brew their own beer. Otherwise, it's the same location, same buildings, not much changed in that respect.  They've got Oak Creek Amber on tap & some really tasty cheese fries (not on the menu). The outdoor bar is rad when it's not 115 degrees out."}
{"text":"Visited a couple days ago and had a great meal. I over heard someone say they have new management/owners, I don't know if it's true or not but either way we would go back.  Pulled pork sandwich was awesome and they have great bbq sauce.  Fish sandwich was huge.  French fries are spot on.  Place looks a bit tore up but I guess that is part of what lends to the charm."}
{"text":"First let me start of by saying how much I hate to give local family owned restaurants a bad review.  I know how these can drive customers to them and away from them.  This review is pretty much like my last one - two ownership changes and a name change ago.  The more things change, the more they stay the same.  Let me start of with Waiter #15 - Lauren R.  Great service, great timing and arrival of meals.  Attentive with out being intrusive or overbearing.  She's a keeper of an employee and a good portion of why this place gets two stars.  Our family of three had Jumbo Nachos and the Silver Spur Platter plus beverages.  That was a $60 meal but it all tasted like it was right out of a plastic Sysco Foods Tub.  No home cooking, no restaurant quality food.  Trust me - Carl's Junior slings a better plate of grub.  Our ribs were \"gooey\", the brisket was dry and the pulled pork and beef were over processed.  None of the meat was very well seasoned and there was no smoke flavor that should accompany BBQ.  The sauce was very sweet and plain as well.  This place has a lot of potential.  They need to clean it up and remodel it - especially the bathrooms.  I feel like I need a tetanus shot for having washed my hands in there.  Take out all of the old kitschy '70's cowboy decor and pressure wash that whole place.  The menu needs an overhaul and they need to move towards quality BBQ at a reasonable price.  Keep Lauren.  She's the best thing going there.  So in summary - I've seen owners change three times here, but I think the biggest thing that needs to change is the kitchen and the cleaning staff.  Oh and for Pete's sake - Please correct the name of your restaurant on Yelp - It is spelled Restaurant not \"Restaurent.\""}
{"text":"When we arrived the place was empty. I ordered the brisket sandwich which was sopposed to be piled high with meat but was piled high with fat. Disgusting. Take a pass on this place unless you like to play \"Songo\" a variant on Bingo."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant twice in the last 7 months. Both times the food and service were great! I had a pulled pork sandwich and fries. Some of the best pulled pork that I have had in a long time. The server was cheerful, upbeat and helpful!"}
{"text":"Was quite the fun night.  The band was hilarious and a treat in itself.   As far as the food, it was decent.  Though I have to say it was not consistent.  We had ordered the brisket quesadilla.  It was dry, very dry...But, another friend ordered it later in the night and theirs was actually pretty awesome, so...  And, I do recall the wings being satisfactory."}
{"text":"I came to Arizona for a graduation at ASU and ate here for lunch the day after. I had the brisket sandwich which was fantastic! I have a hard time finding good brisket since my dad is a butcher and I am used to getting the best cuts of meat. This place knocked it out of the park with the brisket. My wife had the pulled pork which was awesome as well. Moist and smoky, with bbq sauce on the table to add according to your tastes. New ownership has turned this menu around."}
{"text":"Yelp couldnt help me with this one, it does work right sometimes on my phone and couldnt see what was good in cave creek so we  came here, we  probably could have picked anything else and would have been better. Ive wrote about some bad bbq sauces before but this might be the worst and the bbq beef itself was nasty.  I think it was old meat. Also ordered cheese crisp and believe it or not it was too crispy !! no way i would ever go back. If you decide to go dont get anything bbq"}
{"text":"We walked here after eating at Earls. We sat at the bar and ordered drinks. The bartender was friendly and accommodating. It was \"Songo\" night (music trivia bingo) which ended up being really fun! There were friendly people here and reasonable priced drinks. We definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"My recommendation consists of five words: Cream of Green Chile soup. It's a creation of their chef and oh, so good. Came in with my sisters for lunch, the place was pretty empty. The service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Do not eat here! We wanted to eat at the mexican place across the street but the wait was almost 2 hours so we decided to eat here.  The empty place should have been our first clue.  We were a party of 8...we all ordered.. And then 35 minutes later she let us know they were out of sirlion.... So they could give us ribeye  for the sirlion price.... Not bad.... But they only offer 2 steaks.... Hoe can u be out of one?! We got our food 50 minutes after we ordered.  She never came back in those 50 min to ask if we wanter another round of drinks.  I even went inside to find someome.... NOBODY was in sight! When we got our food finally it was not great..... Our steaks were okay nobody was impressesd.  When waitreas asked if everything was okay... My baked potato was ice cold.. She offered to get me a new one... That was nice. When she asked if we wanted more drinks... Which we would normally have said yes.... We r on vacstion..... We all got waters... Didnt want to give them any more of our money at that point.  My boyfriend seen a customer had his dogs in there.... And she was petting it.... He never seem her wash her hands either when she was done.  She even said at the end she was tired from a ling day and didnt want to work hard anymore! Who says that?! Even as a joke..... But she was very serious.   If you want to have terrible food at tourists prices,  no more than 1 round of drinks at your table (its a saloon folks! We might want some... ) and to wait a really lomg ass time for your food.... This is the place to go!"}
{"text":"This has to be some of the best American cooking I have ever had. This oldworld saloon and beer garden has oldworld charm with architecture and pictures to prove it with downright friendly service. There Sun Blond is an excellent micro brew, light yet full of flavor. The pulled pork sandwich is excellent with tender marinaded pork in a lightly sweet and tangy barbecue sauce; better have some extra napkins on hand.! The fries are crispy and greasless, pure potato bliss.! Our server, Allen, was very friendly and knowledgeable about the entire menu. The pickles are wonderfully sour and crisp. They also had KSLX going. So, it was cool to hear some classic rock with my lunch. Note, the saloon and beer garden are separate, the saloon having more food and being a bigger. There is plenty of outdoor seating for a warm Cave Creek day. So, for excellent down home American fare and micro brews with friendly service in an oldworld atmosphere, the Silver Spur cannot be beat. Keep up the good work guys.!"}
{"text":"Best salad bar you'll ever find, especially the value. Food is great. Try the buffalo wrap, taco salad, or pulled pork. Incredible! Great value and add salad bar for a couple bucks. Always have leftovers.  Unfortunately this place is usually dead; therefore, it'll go under within a couple years due to lack of business."}
