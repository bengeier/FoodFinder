{"text":"The best ribs in town!!! Also, try the Angus burger. I was super pleasantly surprised in this crazy Plaza. Happy New Year's!"}
{"text":"Met Danny here at the TIG BBQ!  What a great guy and awesome beef ribs!  Tasted like they just came off the backyard BBQ!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I ordered food to go on my way there and it was ready when I showed up. The guys are friendly and very helpful when you ask about questions on the menu. The food is delicious and the customer service outstanding. This is my new go to spot for any day of the week or weekend. The ribs are delicious!"}
{"text":"Brought some friends here from out of town this week. I have to tell you that they have the best wings I've ever had. No joke.  The ribs were delicious. Wish they had another kitchen on the west side, but definitely worth the trip..."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here twice, actually I should say once and tried to order once. Let me clarify. First time around got a great burger to go and was very satisfied. However when I tried to call today (5 times) I couldn't get anyone on the phone (yes it was during business hours). Like the food, owner seems really nice, but if nobody answers the phone I can't give them my business."}
