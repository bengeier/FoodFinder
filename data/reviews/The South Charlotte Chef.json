{"text":"I absolutely love the South Charlotte Chef!!! The meals are amazing and portioned well enough that I do not have to cook at all.  The lamb is amazing as well as all the dishes.  I highly recommend them.  Chef Sandra is very friendly and totally awesome!!!"}
{"text":"This is a real hidden gem. We had lunch today, best meatballs ever, excellent beef stew, fried green tomato BLT that was very well done, and amazing French fries. Very friendly owner/chef. She apparently cooks family style for people that want to serve at home and not have to cook. We will be back."}
{"text":"Best Greek Salad I've had in years. Every ingredient was so fresh, as if it was harvested today.
The meatball and sausage sandwiches were very good. Again, everything was fresh.
The Eggplant Parmesan dinner was fresh and good. The pasta is cooked to American tastes, and is somewhat soft, but that's to be expected. I'm sure they could make it al dente if you asked.
Delivery was right on time, even though I added an item.
I'd definitely order from South Charlotte Chef again."}
{"text":"Another terrific meal. Even tho you will be quite full and satisfied after your meal, do yourself a favor and grab some of their delectable treats to eat later.

I've had a couple different type of cupcakes, which were terrific and last night I tried some lemon cookies. Dont know if cookie accurately describes this warm chewy delectable goodness, but they were fantastic.

As good or better then similar items I eat when in France, which if you've been there you know you they rule the roost when it comes to breads/pastries/crepes and most delectable goodies.

No need to go to France. Just check and see what delectable goodies Chef Sandra has coming out of the oven."}
{"text":"I love chef Sandra and her new menu is so flexible. We've been using this service for 2 years on and off and I just love the new choices."}
{"text":"We ordered from here through DoorDash tonight and DoorDash messed everything up and took over 90 minutes to get the food to us. The manager at the restaurant called us explaining that it wasn't the restaurants fault and even offered to bring us the food herself. I thanked her and eventually DoorDash came with the food.

When it arrived there was an extra bag with a note saying they were sorry for the lateness of the order and she hopes the free cupcakes she included in the order would help.

On top of all this the food was amazing and the customer service was above and beyond. I wish I could say the same for DoorDash."}
{"text":"We happened upon the South Charlotte Chef by pleasant surprise and will defiantly become regulars!  She made angel hair with meat sauce and chicken sausage on the fly for my husband (the chicken sausage is to die for) and I had chicken pasta with asparagus and goat cheese we highly recommend both!  As the other reviews say... Portions are generous if you leave hungry it's your own fault! 
Sandra is a super sweet lady and a fantastic chef!  Oh if she offers the white vinaigrette for your salad... Get IT!! My husband literally scrapped his plate and mine to get all the dressing goodness and he's not usually a vinaigrette kind of guy!  If you want a delicious home made meal from scratch look NO further.
As I said before we will be regulars from now on!  She offers a variety week to week specials along with some staple sandwiches and such and this is the perfect answer for dinner when I'm too tired or there no time to cook, I'm just going to let her slave in the kitchen for me."}
{"text":"What a cute place and super friendly!  Love this addition to our town.  Yummy desserts in the display case were too tempting to pass on.   Kids loved the cupcakes. Thanks Sandra !!"}
