{"text":"Excellent shop for some of the best yoghurt and milk in Montreal. I have yet to try the pastries (I always go when I am not that hungry or in the morning), but buy the yoghurt. BUY THE YOGHURT."}
{"text":"I had been to La Palette the last time I was in Montreal, and went again for brunch on a recent visit to Montreal with a group of friends. The staff was friendly and accommodating of my dietary restrictions, and the food was delicious and featured locally sourced Quebec ingredients!"}
{"text":"We just stopped by this new café, patisserie and caterer near the Museum of Fine Arts on Sherbrooke Street. We took home fabulous French patisserie. Definitly in a class of their own. The Chef use to be the Executive Chef at Hotel Queen Elizabeth. It shows! We,ll go back to try some more."}
{"text":"This storefront \"pret-a-manger\" caterer offers fully cooked take-out, as well as \"pret-a-cuisiner\" meals that are pre-prepared ingredients that you cook yourself at home. Ostensibly for the purpose of fooling your dinner guests into believing you can cook! They also do event catering.

The day I popped by was to pick up dinner for my parents who wanted something that was a step above standard delivery food, but really did not want to do the cooking. Over all, what I was offered fit the bill, but I found the selections very limited. If you where not in the mood for the couple (meat based) dishes of the day,  or the few side dishes, well, you where out of luck. 

I also found it pricy for what I got. There was no \"meal\" pricing. The portions seemed relatively small and each item (main, side, desert, etc...) had to be purchased separately, and boy did it add up! For the price I paid for a small dinner for two, I really feel that could have spent a few dollars more and went to a nice restaurant and had table service thrown in for the price.

All in all, not a bad little place and it probably serves the demographic of the Golden Square Mile very well. It would be nice if they could add a little more variety, especially in the veg. department and perhaps stock more gourmet sundries on their retail shelves, using their storefront to the best benefit."}
{"text":"I stopped in this bistro/pâtisserie today for the first time to pick up a latte and a quiche for breakfast as a treat. The woman serving me was really nice, and welcoming. All the seats were taken so i ordered to go, that's a great sign that the Sunday brunch there is a hit! I'm looking forward to trying it out myself. One downside is that they don't have many pastries like danishes, croissants, etc. And that would really make this place a part of my regular errands as I live in the neighbourhood. 

The latte was supreme and reminded me that starbucks really isn't worth the money. And the quiche was out of this world! Along with the good service, I had a very positive first experience at La Palette Gourmand, and I would suggest that if you find yourself on Sherbrooke and Mackay, stop in and check it out :)"}
{"text":"Cute little pastry shop! My friend and I happened to walk by and decided to be spontaneous and go try it out. The decor is simple, white chairs, wooden tables. The server/cashier was very nice and welcoming. She went through the details of each dessert pastry they had in the store. Note: the pastry chef won an award for 2016. I think it was for best in montreal (not entirely sure). They recommended us the chocolate cube. It was a small chocolate mousse desert with cake, caramel, and sea salt. It was topped with tiny gold garnishes and a small sheet of chocolate. I'm allergic to all nuts...and even though many places I've been to specified that the certain desserts didn't have notes I still end up having a minor nut allergy after a bite or two. However, I did not experience any nut allergy reactions after this chocolate dessert. On top of that it was one of the best chocolate cakes/desserts that I've had so far. It's definitely on my top 8 chocolate desserts. The chocolate was semi-sweet, rich, not too overwhelming and the cake was moist and light. The pastry was simply perfection!! Totally recommend ;)"}
{"text":"Disappointing. Ordered what looked like a flaky empanada and side of veggies. She heated the empanada in the microwave, thus reducing it to a steaming pocket of chewy slime. The broccoli was similarly overcooked and limp. Final straw: this place bills itself as a teahouse but their tea menu was limited to only 7 or 8 choices, most of which had been scrawled over in black marker. Won't be back. 2 stars granted for the cute decor and sunny terrasse."}
{"text":"If you feel like spoiling yourself for lunch or a nice pâtisserie, this is just the place to go. Especially if you're in the neighbourhood visiting the museum or nearby shops. 

Their options are intentionally limited, as the food is fresh and flavourful. It shows confidence in what they have to offer. Everything is amazing, so you really can't go wrong. 

From the moment I stepped in, the woman behind the counter was extraordinarily helpful and knowledgeable in English and in French. 

I took the soup and salad combo for $12 with tax and tip. A fuller meal will be around $20. 

Other times I've come in, I was only looking for a fancy ingredient to complement my own cooking. With their little shop in the front, they've got just what you need. I recommend the dark chocolate and blueberry jam. It was a hit with everyone at my brunch. 

Five stars."}
{"text":"Mediocre deserts for top dollar. Wouldn't honor the 25% off yelp promo. Staff had no idea about it... I hate that!!!!"}
