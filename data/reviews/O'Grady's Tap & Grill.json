{"text":"French onion soup should be called french onion SALT with a dump truck of cheese on top. Flavour was ok, but salt trucks could have used it to melt a lot of winter snow. U of T burger was alright, beer selection and price is ok, but the pepsi (of all things) was unusually good.. extra syrupy. It's a Uni bar.. what else can I say."}
{"text":"Every time I visit O'Grady's, I scan the menu and have nothing that I actually want to order. The only thing that stands out to me is the extremely poor service and their lack of desire to take responsibility for it.  O'Grady's used to be a regular hangout for my friends, due to its proximity to campus and its cheap prices. Although we were getting tired of their menu, we visited again, since it's so hard to make a change with 10 people.  At my last visit with these 10-12 people, everyone's food came out, except mine. After waiting a little longer for the status of my order, the food runner said that my order never reached the kitchen. The server never addressed my concern. It came out eventually, without an apology or any other compensation. One of my friends asked for chipotle mayo 3 times and had regular mayo delivered each time.  When we went to pay, not only were we refused separate billing, we were refused a receipt entirely, because she had already \"cashed out\" the bill. What? Is this even legal?  Needless to say, I've never gone back."}
{"text":"Pros: cheap/free room rental, close to transit, private room has a private entrance Cons:  the bartender was extremely unprofessional and turned the lights off completely at 1:38 instead of politely saying something about closing up, when we complained she turned them on very dimly so we could at least see our coats and find the stairs. got double booked even though I asked to pay a deposit to ensure the the room would be mine, they said the room capacity was 150 this is only true if you like being sardined into people and pool tables, they only take cash upstairs"}
{"text":"This is a solidly ordinary pub, with a solidly ordinary pub menu. No complaints here. When I went there weren't a lot of students around. The service was quick and competent and the food was -- well it was pub food."}
{"text":"Like a C student in first year, this place was the epitome of mediocrity. Everything was just okay. Food was okay, the atmosphere was a bit meh, even though it's so close to the university. Seeing as it was hotter than hell outside I was looking forward to some AC. Nothing. At least nothing I could feel. The service was good (there were less than 6 tables full and at least half were just people talking) but she was attentive nonetheless. It was rather empty. I suspect summer students found their beer in a more stimulating location.   If you're looking for a classic beer drinking and socializing environment, this is not it.  Keep walking, my friends..."}
{"text":"Food is just soso. My friend and I ordered UoT style burger. But it was nonsense, the flavor is so light. I really like strong flavor burger. Btw, the waitress is very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Not even once. Food is overprice and not even half as good as it looks in the photos. Such a rip off it felt mean."}
{"text":"Fun for karaoke nights on Wednesdays. Karaoke is hosted by Ty Chidlow and typically starts Wednesdays around 10pm.  The wait staff seem nice but are very slow and inattentive. Don't recommend eating here. Just like most people mention, the food's very mediocre."}
{"text":"Came here with a party we booked the upstairs. So first I ordered a pitcher of Steamwhistle it tasted sour like a cidar, maybe they messed up the kegs. Told the bartender and she quickly gave me a sample of three other beers and I resorted to the Amsterdam Amber. All of the ones I tried tasted either flat or sour. Glad she let me try a few before I bought a pitcher but it really was still gross tasting beer.   The food here is underwhelming pub grub. Overall experience is what you'd expect from a University bar: sub-par."}
{"text":"This place is... incredibly mediocre. Their happy hour consists of a few food items (dips, fries and a mini quesadilla - with the emphasis on \"mini\" and a generous use of the word \"quesadilla\") you can get for $4 each with the purchase of a beverage. Don't take this option. In fact, if you're not a U of T student, there shouldn't be any reason to go here. If you are a U of T student, consider walking a little farther for a little more quality."}
{"text":"Gross. Drinks so overpriced it was scary. Server asked my friend, verbatim, \"what's wrong with your eyes?\"  Dead on a Saturday night. Skip it"}
{"text":"Best place to go on a Thursday night after lecture for $4 drinks and pints."}
{"text":"Everywhere you look university students. I had my first drink as a 19 year old here so it holds that quickly fading special place in my heart.  And frankly things seem to have hardly changed from back then, it's still frequented by young undergrads who seem to realise as the years goes on that there are bigger and better bars around :)   If you are an undergrad student, yes this is a great spot for you, on big game nights (or just during the end of exams) O'Grady's has a wonderful student atmosphere and the upstairs portion (which has undergone it's own set of changes in the past) can be a hit or a miss.   Staff behind the bar have always seemed friendly, although some nights they do take their own time getting to you. The food here is slightly better than average actually and coupled with their good pricing, O'Grady's does get my (not so high yet passable) recommendation if you want a pub meal.   Their patio is one of my least favourite things about this, it's extremely small and just really bad location right by an intersection and smokers and patio go-ers are within 10 feet of each other.   Come in for a cheap drink or catching a game/UFC on their big screen but expect it to be super student friendly. 3.5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Been here before and did not enjoy it, however they are under new management and it shows. I visited a few weeks ago and it was great. Cheap drinks, great selection on food as well.   Really enjoyed my time, will become a regular again."}
{"text":"This must be a place for students because anyone with taste buds and who enjoys good service should not go here.  I met someone for a first date on a Thursday night after work. There was maybe 4 other patrons in the whole bar with two waitresses who spent the entire time talking together and with a couple of older men at the bar. It took forever for either of them to check in on us not only to being with but also infrequently during our visit. I hate having to wait for a second drink and for the bill which had to be chased down.   When we did get to order food we got some boneless wings which were chewy and not very warm temperature-wise and a Gyro in a pita which had two strips of meat that were over cooked and cold. I should have realized the food would be bad when I noticed how many choices and ethnic options there were. These things can't be done the justice they deserve if they are being thrown together along side burgers and chicken wings.  I can't imagine people are going here for anything other than drink specials and late night drunk food. I know I will never go back and encourage everyone to spend their money elsewhere."}
{"text":"This may look like an irish pub, but they have no irish food there. Their staff are inconsiderate and impatient. The food is bland, and the cocktails are watered down. BEWARE There may be an included service charge on the bill. When you can't even make garlic toast without messing it up, you probably shouldn't be running."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with the lab. Not exactly the best place for a casual lunch with the TV's blaring football and men talking loudly. Otherwise, atmosphere was nice, service was quick. Ordered fish and chips: Fish was nicely cooked, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Wedge fries, good but not seasoned. Tartar sauce given in a small plastic container, not a bottle or bowl.  Prices are reasonably high, considering its a pub."}
{"text":"I had very low expectations when coming here. It was the closest place to go and on a Friday evening around 8pm I was actually surprised the place wasn't packed with students.  Beer selection was pretty good, although I didn't try any food. I imagine when busy this place turns into a shitshow but on my stop in, no real complaints!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed with this place. I live very close and my boyfriend and I were looking for a place to go grab a beer. It was very cold, so we didn't want to walk far and we decided to come here.  Long story short: bad service (we waited over 20 minutes for someone to take our order, and this was at about 11:30 on a wednesday night), expensive, rude servers and bad food. For the area, you can do better."}
{"text":"Service is poor even on a slow day. Waitresses are friendly but not attentive at any time. Only 2 couples in the place but it took over 15 mins for our drinks which came after our food. We ordered 2 pnds of wings which I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Quick fry and just swimming in sauce. Gross even for pub-food.  But the student/sports bar appeal is there. I could see myself agreeing to come here to watch a game over beer again. Drinks only though, food is not recommended."}
{"text":"Burgers were good, house salad is literally just lettuce with onions. Staff isn't friendly."}
{"text":"Good universities and good bars go together like Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  I liked O'Grady's and found the pub to be rather old fashioned in a nice way.  The service was standard pub service.  I liked the fact that the server left me alone to take my time to decide.  The selection of beer on tap was overwhelming and wonderful.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give this a lower rating is because I'm not able to.  Service - Bad! Food - Bad! Atmosphere - Bad! Cleanliness - Bad!  Even the prices aren't that cheep for it to be a good dive bar.  Don't take my word for it, check the other reviews.  Specifically the good ones 5/5.  Please pay close attention to how many review those contributors have made.  Funny how most of them only left one review and it was a 5/5 for this place?   Even the O'Grady's on Church is better than this one and they had a Hep A outbreak during Pride."}
{"text":"Atrocious. Beyond atrocious. Worst service I've ever had at a pub, I cannot believe just how bad this place was.  I went there for a late lunch just after 1pm.  My friend and I went in, were directed to sit anywhere by a rather surly blonde behind the bar.  I didn't think much of it.  Another person working came by, dropped two menus, pointed out the specials, and then disappeared without even asking us for a drink order.  In a place that's making its money off of serving alcohol, that's not a good decision.  So we perused the menu and got into a little bit of a conversation, and it was 10 minutes before I finally had to ask the woman behind the bar if she could take a drink order, then again about a food order - not once did someone actually come and ask us for orders.  Not exactly acceptable.  I will say when the meals arrived they weren't bad.  Nothing exceptional, but nothing bad.  They forgot the cheese on a cheeseburger, though, and my Tennessee Chicken Sandwich looked rather overdone, an unappetizing shade of brown.  It was, however, rather tasty and the focaccia bread worked well with it.  We practically had a to beg for another round of beers because no one bothered to come and ask (again, amateur hour?).  So when we finished our meals and our beers we got the bill and paid.  It's very rare - in fact, I don't think it's ever happened - that I refuse to tip, but tips are a gratuity.  Acceptable service earns them and great service I don't hesitate to tip generously.  Since we had neither I felt no such obligation.  After we signed the slips, the woman behind the bar chirps at my friend about \"needing the long one\".  My friend pointed out that indeed she had left the merchant copy, eliciting a ridiculously inappropriate \"You don't have to be rude\" because we weren't.  I was unimpressed, but we weren't the rude ones.  I'm more diplomatic than my friend because she lost it at this point, a brief heated exchange occurred, and we left.  She said \"please don't come back\".  It wasn't necessary.  I won't, and neither should anyone else.  I guess in hindsight I do have a tip: if you work in a pub, you make your living from selling booze and lots of it, and from being pleasant, not from making guests who would have spend more money feel like they were inconveniencing you by doing business with them."}
{"text":"Just a solid pub to grab a decent meal. The waitress was very friendly, making sure we had everything we needed. I had the pork skewers that were on special that day along with their soup. Very good, fast and affordable. I'd surely return here if I were pressed for time and in the same area. Only drawback was that the place looked a little outdated/rundown, which I guess plays a part in making it look like a pub."}
{"text":"Back in the day, this was a hot-spot for Uni students who could get a pitcher of beer for $10. Tack another 10 years onto your age and you'll be looking at this place with a whole new set of eyeballs and a brain that screams: \"I cannot believe you didn't die from eating here.\"   Sat on the patio and got some Old Vienna beer for $5.50 a pint (not bad but it's no $10 pitcher  - apparently those are now $15 and Amsterdam beer only). Then the waitress brought me the menu. I almost puked. It was soaked through and CLEARLY had mould/mildew growing on both sides. When I pointed it out she said it was \"from getting left in the rain last night,\" sure. But mildew doesn't grow THAT fast. I told her it had put me right off my appetite, but she didn't seem to care, really.   so, It's lunch time and I walk inside into almost pitch blackness - electricity too expensive? then I realize it's probably to stop you from noticing how disgusting the place is.  #1: It's only about 1 hour into lunch and already one of the ladies rooms was out of toilet paper.  #2: There were garbage bows and relics of last night's party on the floor. I don't think the staff swept or even looked at the bathrooms when they started their shifts... #3. Duct tape was their go-to \"repair solution as I saw it in about 5 places. #4. A scam-artist jerk walked right onto the patio and came up behind me demanding money and actually yelled at me for not giving it to him - all on \"private property.\"  I was the only one on the patio so i was scared to leave anything outside. Had to bring my book bags in with me and even hid my beer with the menu because I was sure some other crack-head would come by and just drink it - or worse - while I was gone.    Just really not worth it... I remember it being a \"dive,\" but this is like a dive that continued to dive for another 10 years and is now stuck so deep, they are going to need an industrial strength drill to dig them out.    I guess I'll pay the extra $2 and try a beer at the nicer looking bar with nicer looking guys in sexy dress shirts and ties down at the Pre-nup pub. I wish there was something in between. College kids are getting a  raw deal in the area."}
{"text":"$4 Molson pints on Thursdays. 'nuff said."}
{"text":"The thing about this place is you have to temper your expectations before going.  As I'm sure countless others have pointed out, this is a cheap grungy student pub.  The food is mediocre pub food, but it gets the job done.  I had the wings on half price night, and for $5 that pound of wings went down nicely with $5 bucket of onion rings and the $15 jug of Amsterdam Blonde.  Was it the best wings/rings/beer ever? No, but for the price it was very good.  Also, I got the wing sauce on the side, as it seems from other reviews that they may drown their wings in it normally.  I'm from the East Coast, so dry wings with dip is how we normally do it anyway from what I recall.  Servers were efficient, friendly, and cute.  Big screen TV, and multiple other flat screens so you can see games anywhere you sit, definitely a plus.  Again, set your expectations appropriately, and you won't mind this place a bit."}
{"text":"Well if you want cheap beer and a great place to watch the game with college students, this is the place to be. And really remember that this is a UoT joint! So it's actually a great place to watch people go on their first dates. So 5/5 star rating for people watching!  But back to being serious. They have some great weekly drink deals, but be warned the martinis are watered down. So it's not really worth it unless you're grabbing beer.   The food... unless you're getting fries, I would not eat here. This place takes the cake for the worst bruschetta I have ever eaten. I don't know how you do that! Bruschetta is just a combo of bread, tomatoes, basil, onions, and maybe cheese or balsamic vinagrette. The topping was made with tomatoes, onion, and... I think white radish? The bread was apparently a vienna roll, but tasted like a rather large and fancier hot dog bun. The sauce... was Kraft Italian dressing.   The service was really friendly and the atmosphere is actually pretty decent. It's not as sticky as you'd expect a place like this to be. But all in all, this is definitely a 2 star place."}
{"text":"great place if you are a student, not great if you are not.   The fries were HORRIBLE!  I think I ate two fries and left the rest for my friends to eat. They were all very worried about why I wasn't eating them (I friggin' love fries) I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong with them but I knew they just tasted funny. One friend concurred but others managed to enjoy them."}
{"text":"For a friend's belated birthday we spontaneously decided to go here.  Sitting in the patio was alright; small but it's too be expected for the location. The waitress saw us and came out with food menus pretty quickly then left. However she didn't come back with drink menus, which was what we were there for. We had to ask and it took her a while to find one (you're a pub, why are there no drink menus??)  She also didn't give enough time to decide on drinks, so two of my friends ordered and another was still deciding like myself.  The best pitcher came pretty quickly - it was only $11 since I saw the deal on an app that I have. Mine also came pretty fast after I'd ordered.  The waited came back thrice, though. Once to check on it drinks, another to check again and ask if we wanted to order more, and yet another to ask yet again if we'd like to order more. Not to pushy, but i felt three trips was pretty unnecessary. All in all a pretty generic place."}
{"text":"As a few others mentioned, this is a very ordinary bar.  Average prices, average food, average service.  One thing that ticked me off though was their half-price wings deal. I don't know if they still have it but when they did, you needed to buy a drink (can be alcoholic or non-alcoholic) for the special to take effect. A little annoying but not a big deal, except they didn't mention that anywhere. It wasn't on their website and it wasn't printed anywhere inside.   You go in thinking you're going to get the deal and the server just casually throws that in. I hate it when businesses pull stuff like that. If your special has conditions, don't hide them. Be wary of any other deals they might have.  Other than that, just a very regular place."}
{"text":"This is indeed the default pub for U of T.  Many first and second yr students enjoy some of their best college years in this pub! More of a mix of artsy and engineers than either Molly Bloom (mostly artsci) and Einstein's (Engineer galore). So service is slow, crowd is ok, food is also ok (more the sandwiches than the pub fare), drinks are ok too and cheaper on Thursday. The place has been shut down in the past for serving underage etc.,  That being said, the management appreciates the college crowd in a multitude of ways."}
{"text":"I came here a lot in my undergrad years.  It's a pretty standard pub with standard pub food and drink.  They have a nice big screen at the back for anybody looking to watch sports.    Service is decent but starts to nosedive the busier the bar gets.  I would recommend the club sandwich as a good choice if in the mood for food.  Pay attention to the daily specials that they have written on the chalk boards as well.  As a student that can save you enough money to buy something else, like another drink!"}
{"text":"Why, oh why, must so many \"default\" U of T pubs be so bad, by default?  I guess I was never one for the socializing-by-program kinda tendency, so maybe I just don't get the whole camaraderie between people sharing a residence, or faculty, or beer provider.  I'll say it again: I'm all about the food. The staff is very sociable, and its proximity to much of my life for the past 6 years (yes, I said SIX years) is obviously an asset. However, I have a policy of not being disappointed by my meals more than...well, 3 times tops. I'd say I gave it a fair chance. The slightly-turned feta cheese pretty much sealed the deal, sorry to say."}
{"text":"Was in the area early and in search for a bite before class.   Walked into O'grady's and figured I'd sit down for a plate fish and chips. I'd been here before for a pint or two but had never tried their food.  Pros:  Large portion. Didn't eat half of it despite how famished I was.    The waitress was very friendly and accommodating. Told me the F&C was a popular dish so I'd be happy with my choice.   Cons:  She lied.   Frankly the food was not great. The chips were good but it's hard to screw up fries or potato wedges. The fish batter was tasteless. So was the filet it covered up. No amount of salt, pepper, lime, tartar sauce, ketchup, or vinegar could bring it to life. I tried everything.  No debit.  No wifi (really? In a university campus area?)  I RECOMMEND: drinking, not eating. Big screens so might be a good hangout on game nights.  EXTRS TIP: This one goes out to management. Get some wifi for your patrons. I would have sat around drinking for hours while studying if you had wifi. Instead I left within 20 mins and headed next door to second cup. As if a white hot chocolate can compete with a draft.   Shame on you. In this day and age."}
{"text":"Yeah.. never again..   Came here one night for drinks with a few friends as we were in the area. To start off, the place was pretty empty, our group consisted of 4 people, and there was probably another 6 people in the pub.  The service was not good. Our waitress wasn't checking up on us, probably came to us just to take an order, give our order, check up once then give the bill. She wasn't rude or anything though.   Drinks were PRICY for a pub.. I've been to many pubs yet this one had pricy drinks. Food was horrible.. my friend and I decided to share nachos and that was a horrible idea. It was so gross!"}
