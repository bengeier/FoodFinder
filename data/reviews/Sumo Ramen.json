{"text":"I've eaten here several times now.  

Really enjoyed the ramen.  Large bowls brimming with tasty goodness.   Note, some bowls have more meat and toppings than others.

Gyozas are also very good and appear to be made in restaurant as opposed to the frozen bought variety.  

Chicken wings were also very good however last time they came undercooked.  

I'll give that a pass as until that dish everything has been great.  

Very attentive service.

Will be back again."}
{"text":"This was definitely a 'Meh' experience. The fast food of ramen- not terrible, but definitely not good.
The menu does offer a lot to pick from if you're looking to snack, but I wouldn't bother with the ramen at all."}
{"text":"If you're aiming to go on a date or a somewhat pleasant after work get together with some co workers, this restaurant isn't the place to be. For instance, the price is acceptable and the place quite cozy. Not being to much of an expensive restaurant (a bowl of ramen being around 7$ and appetizers being not to pricey) , we should expect no less from the foods quality. Their appetizers and ramens aren't as delectable as any other ramen restaurant, but I highly recommend for it being a get-together gather with friends and with a whole variety of choice with other foods and desserts to choose. The service was quite peculiar. They were indeed very nice and humble with their clients for every time that I went there, and the restaurant was quite profound in its showing of Japanese culture. They had indeed lots of decoration and ornaments representing the cultural aspect of their food, so it was a bonus. Everywhere being clean and neat, even the washrooms where acceptable. I highly recommend this place for any Japanese food lover living in Montreal. :)"}
{"text":"After spending a week in Montreal, my husband and I decided to give Sumo Ramen a whirl. We started off with the gyoza appetizer - it wasn't bad but not great. I ordered the kimchi ramen and it was the most tasteless ramen I have ever had (and I have eaten lots of ramen in my life). The broth - the most important part of ramen - was like water (not enough taste to even call it bland). The kimchi was meh, the noodles weren't cooked all the way, and the bowl wasn't piping hot when served. The best part of this tasteless dish was the two strips of pork belly. 

My husband ordered the curry rice with shrimp that came with a salad and miso soup. The miso soup was also tasteless and inedible. The curry was extremely watery with no chunks of veggies or potatoes. But the curry dish was still better than my kimchi ramen.
 
I really wanted Sumo Ramen to be delicious but it was horribly bad."}
{"text":"Bon resto accueil sympa plats plus que correctes une grande variétés et chose appréciée les serveurs parlent français chose assez rare dans le quartier chinois
Toutefois ce n est pas vraiment japonais mais plutôt chinois même si le chef est un chinois ayant travaillé des années au Japon on sent tout de même dans certains plats une pointe de chinoiserie
Ça vaut tout de même le détour si on passe par Montréal 
Bon rapport qualité prix vu les portions assez conséquentes"}
{"text":"Mitten in Chinatown ein Restaurant, welches eigentlich auf eine japanische Speise spezialisiert ist: Ramen (eine Nudelsuppe mit verschiedenen Beilagen) Mich interessierte mehr eine andere Lieblingsspeise von mir, die Teigtaschen \"Gyoza\", die hier mit einer köstlichen Knusperkruste angeboten werden.
Der Laden liegt im ersten Stock und war zur Mittagszeit nahezu voll besetzt. Trotzdem wurde ich flott und freundlich bedient und die Gyozas waren köstlich. Dann war das Ganze auch noch äusserst preiswert (mit Getränk und kleiner Vorspeise 8$), so dass ich eine klare Empfehlung aussprechen möchte."}
{"text":"A real bright gem for Japanese ex pats and likes in the heart of Chinatown.  

Having moved here from Japan so many years ago, I yearn for a real Japanese food even more every year.  This joint filled that void in me.  A real ramen joint in Montreal?   It can't be true! (oh yes, it's true!)

Menu included 7 or 8 kinds of ramen which you can choose soup base from miso or soy sauce.  Gyudon (beef bowl), Unadon (eel bowl), Curry rice, etc, all the right menus at right price points.  I was a bit skeptical of its authenticity at first, given the Chinatown location, but I was proven dead wrong.  

I had a Kazan ramen and gyoza. Mmm. gyoza!   Gyoza is wonderful, every living men in Japan loves them, and it can put people ecstatic state if they taste good.  Sumo restaurant hit homerun for me.

First off, where else in Montreal, can you find a handmade gyoza that are grilled in a right way with pari-pari (thin sheet of gyoza skin) on top?  Knowing how much easier to serve you a frozen gyoza for a restaurant, these guys are serious about the gyozas and it shows in the flavor.

The ramen was wonderful - having had ramen in other resto on St. Laurent in upper Main, sorry but there is no comparison.  As a ramen junky, I loved the selection of ramens and I think it's so cool to have a real Chinese addition to the menu.  You can choose to add selective toppings much like the restos in Japan.  The soup tasted great and I definitely think that it was adapted well for customer base in Montreal, not to say that it was bad, but to assure that this restaurant is serious about staying in business as well.

Yes, I am totally impressed with the food and I am thrilled even more that there is a restaurant who cares and respect a very popular type of Japanese food, most appreciated by ordinary people.  One of the staff there told me as I was paying after the meal, the chef was a Chinese but spent 7-8 years in Tokyo food business.  Makes a complete sense and I want to applaud him for having the gut and resource to pull this off.  Having this restaurant in Montreal definitely makes my homesick a lot easier to deal with.

So if you are a Japanese ex pat, you should definitely go there and enjoy the gyoza and the ramen.  if you want to experience a definitely most popular type of food in Japan, you should go there too.  

Nothing can bring down my happiness about this restaurant, but because I was so impressed with this restaurant, I would like to offer a few points of my wish list to make this joint a KING of ramen in North America:

- soy sauce, vinegar and hot oil at every table for customers who would like to make their own gyoza dipping sauce.
- porc on top of the ramen could be lot more fattier and it would be perfect if it can be lightly blackened on the surface like in Tokyo
- I would love to see a ramen with gyofun (ground dried fish) or katsuobushi (bonito frake), which is becoming sooo popular in Japan
- Tsukemen (noodle served in a separate bowl and a dipping sauce) would be also awesome
- Use of Korean bread crumb (larger frakes), not western bred crumb (almost like corn meal)  for fried shrimp and scallop would make it even more authentic"}
{"text":"The cash register was trying to play smart by giving me change after paying. $10.10 and he gave me coins instead. Why? I figured out as I was about to leave. the dude makes me turn around to tell me I FORGOT TO LEAVE TIP for such a restaurant with really bad service and yells go to mc D's instead. Waiting for the table was hectic. If you came in groups of 4+, you pretty much have priority over someone whose bringing their date. Did not enjoy my experience here and would not recommend unless you're trying fight your way eating the food as it wasn't well made either."}
{"text":"Broth is decent (for Montreal). Noodles are OK (for Montreal). However, there is no edible ramen place within 2 km so this will do."}
{"text":"If you love ramen, I don't see why you wouldn't like this place. I especially like to order dishes from the entres, all very delicious."}
{"text":"One of the better ramen joints in Montreal, and certainly the best in Chinatown!  Fun ambiance, a good menu (much more than ramen if you feel like a change!), and lots of seating."}
{"text":"Solid! This will be my ramen place in montreal. Had the negi shoyu, Portion was just right. The default 2 chashu slices were thick and juicy, the way chashu should be. I finished the broth... I know, not a healthy thing to do, but it was so f@#*ing good, I couldn't stop."}
{"text":"Place is sometimes crowded/feels impersonal. Ramen was good but then again I am not a connaisseur. The ramen with chicken  bites was original and delicious, same for the won ton ramen.
The service can be lacking sometimes though, perhaps due to the crowdiness of the resto."}
{"text":"This is most likely the second or first place for the most shitty ramen I have ever had in my life. There was nothing in my meal (except for maybe for the grocery store miso paste) that is Japanese at all. The 'ramen' was just average everyday Chinese soup noodles. The egg was literally a hard boiled egg. That was disgusting to eat, it wasn't the typical ramen broth eggs which would be marinated. Nothing was right in this meal. I would never come back again. I never understood why it's so busy here, but I think it's probably because it's in Chinatown so solely based on location it gets business. The noodles were even clumped together when it was brought out to me. They didn't have the effort to stir the noodles as they cooked them. The fired tofu piece was decent but has ZERO flavour in them. The miso soup base it the EXACT miso paste from the supermarket. All in all I could've made myself a much better bowl of miso NOODLES (not ramen), since at least I'd care enough to stir my noodles so that it wouldn't clump together. DONT COME UNLESS IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO OTHER RESTAURANT CHOICES. In the end I didn't have any ramen at all I just drank all the miso that I could've made myself for 1/12 the price."}
{"text":"Des restaurants vietnamiens, il en pleut à Montréal... Celui qui veut goûter une bonne «pho» a vraiment l'embarras du choix... Par contre, si vous faites partie de ces amoureux qui aimeraient de temps à autre sauter la clôture gustative seulement pour voir ce qu'ont à nous proposer les autres cultures asiatiques en matière de soupes, sachez que le restaurant japonais Sumo Ramen, situé au cur pompant du quartier chinois, propose ses propres spécialités qui n'ont absolument rien à voir avec le Pays du Dragon. Le Soleil Levant est-il de taille? J'en doute fortement... Ça vaut quand même la peine d'essayer, car Montréal ne compte que très peu de restaurants du style «Ramen» et celui-ci est l'un des plus reconnus...

Il faut avant tout mentionner que je n'étais décidément pas prédisposé à aimer leurs soupes en raison de l'omniprésence de deux ingrédients : algues (nori, wakame) et champignons (enoki). Si vous ne pouvez ingurgiter l'un ou l'autre, c'est à éviter. Peu importe le bouillon que vous sélectionnerez (poivré, salés ou miso), leur présence se fera sentir... Ouais, même si vous demandez votre soupe exempte desdits ingrédients, ce que j'ai fait pour les algues, le bouillon sera tout de même imprégné d'une saveur marine bien japonaise qu'il m'est encore impossible d'aimer. L'ajout d'un oeuf à demi-cuit est aussi un indispensable, ajout dont je me serais passé volontiers. Je n'adhère pas encore à ce concept... Les autres ingrédients quasi permanents sont les échalotes, fèves germées, et bien-sûr, les nouilles, qui macéraient dans un opaque bouillon poivré peu ragoûtant... Ça m'a laissé froid. Enfin, l'on peut choisir (heureusement!) un plat d'à-côté, en l'occurrence, du poulet grillé, que l'on incorpore à notre guise dans la soupe.

Outre les soupes, quelques grillades figurent sur le menu : calmars, poissons, pétoncles, crevettes, poulets... On y trouve même de la pieuvre frite!... Vous pourrez également choisir d'accompagner votre repas d'une grande variété d'entrées, allant de la salade d'algues aux tranches de porc marinées.

Enfin bref, je suis loin d'être convaincu. Pour l'instant, le Pays du Dragon et ses «pho» triomphent haut la baguette...


- Au bonheur de plusieurs, le restaurant est un «apportez votre vin»..."}
{"text":"Amazing ramen. I had the volcano pork, top notch. Even the regular size is huge. We love this place, best ramen in Montreal, only problem is parking is a bit of a pain in the area but hardly their fault (Chinatown). Go here"}
{"text":"Been in a hiatus. 

I apologize Yelp, and everyone in Montreal. 

Completely worst experience that it has made me make a review. You would believe that after 5 months , I'll have something good to say about one restaurant!! 

Service is terrible, in fact its a complete waste of time and of money for any reasonable customer--the waiters have been completely useless and their attempts to recommend any foods is just to get extra tips and money --be aware when you pay cash they attempt to put it in their pocket rather than offer a honest bill with a receipt to their customer! 

Food is not authentic nor good. Indeed, what you have in front of you are Chinese trying a mix of noodle cuisine fusion with some HK--completely disgusting -- no flavours and the meat is terrible. Like imagine one offers you instant noodles that are cooked 20 mins ago and then they bring it to you while expecting you to enjoy it--terrible and fake. 

Honestly,  try any other japanese restaurant outside of this area--you will have a better experience and enjoyment for your own money for the service and the food. 

I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant in a long time, and I definitely think this is one of the worst restaurant in Chinatown. If one doesn't believe me it's fine. However, this is one of the place to be AVOIDED AT ALL COST in this city."}
{"text":"Having had a lot of ramen in New York, I wanted to check out ramen in Canada. This specific ramen place has a great environment. It is located on the second floor, so the poster on the first floor door confused me...

I had ramen for lunch and it's pretty much what I expect at a ramen joint. If you've been to ramen places, this is just like all the other ramen places. Some Japanese decor, big bowl of ramen and extras if you want. One thing I noticed is that the noodles in this ramen place is straight. I'm used to curly ramen noodles in New York. Still, it satisfies my taste-buds."}
{"text":"We tried Pork bone ramen & Miso ramen. But both of these were extremely bad. They had no flavour, lacking taste. If you are Japanese, you don't have to go there. We are Japanese and also we brought friend who is Canadian is from Toronto. We had been so many ramen places in Canada but we've never had this experience. Just I wanna tell you this restaurant is so bad. I don't wanna go there anymore.
?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Spicy beef ramen from sumo ramen is one of my favorite montreal Chinatown noodles. For some people it may be to spicy but you can always ask them to put less."}
{"text":"Satisfying food and pretty authentic (recently got back from a month in Japan). I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they had okonomiyaki and that it was good! I wish it was bigger though, I miss the Japanese size. This one was more of an appetizer. The ramen was filling, thankfully not too salty and flavourful. I am so happy to have found this spot. Yum!"}
{"text":"Sumo Ramen is some damn fine buttery ramen and izakaya with a convenient location to boot. Seriously, I could have eaten here at least three more times during my one week stay this year in Montreal.  Every morning, I would wake up craving Sumo's delicate creamy broth.  Drinking it up with the large ladle they provide makes the entire experience even more amuzing.  Upgrade to the shio ramen and you will thank me later.  Me personally, in the future I am saying yes to corn and no to bean sprouts.  

I believe the owners are from Hong Kong, however this is some mighty fine Japanese style ramen!  The izakaya dishes are also praise worthy, rivaling even some of the most popular Manhattan 8th Street establishments in my book.  The Takoyaki was absoulutely perfect in every way, even the inside was cooked to perfection.

They also even serve bubble tea of the milky variety.  I don't think that they will make it into a smoothy for you, so don't even bother with that one.  We arrived so early that the boba was not even ready yet, so I went with a large frothy taro sans boba."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a great Monday night crowd. Traveling to Japan on multiple occasions, I can attest this is the most authentic Ramen in Eastern Canada. A wide selection of seafood, chicken and beef with various noodle choices. I chose a miso based soup with Udon noodles and chicken. We started with a few appetizers to start and some authentic Japanese beer which made for a great opening. We were fortunate enough to have the owner Anthony visit our table to inquire about our meal. My girlfriend found him very polite and attractive, before his sister stopped by and she was even prettier piece! Good food, atmosphere and owners. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Are you a fan of 80's Hong Kong action films? I sure am. What I like the most about them is without a doubt the fact that they kick ASS. Wanna know what else kicks as much (if more) ass? This god damn joint. I ordered ramen with grilled chicken. It came under 10 minutes. The service was quick and professional. 
The food itself is GREAT. The ramen were delicious and the bouillon was so creamy and tasty that I almost felt like slurping the bowl. The chicken was also good. well-cooked and well-seasoned. If you're looking for a good ramen spot in chinatown, look no further, friends."}
{"text":"The noodles were not Japanese.
The broth did not have authentic Japanese flovor.
I got overcharged and the cashier did not give a receipt."}
{"text":"Just another typical \"Japanese restaurant\" opened by Chinese people. The food just doesn't... make any sense.

In what kind of Ramen restaurant do you see bubble tea on the menu?

Alright, let's get started:

1. The ramen doesn't make any sense whatsoever. You got Chinese handmade noodles (which, by the way, was extremely f***ing delicious) instead of the Japanese ramen. Why not make the place a Chinese noodle shop then? You got such PERFECT noodles and you're ruining it with... the soup base, which I'm going to rant next.

2. The soup tasted absolutely horrible. I tasted at least a good 10 grams of MSG in it, and only a very small scoop of miso mixed with soy sauce and hot water. The \"chef\" should be ashamed of himself for ruining good handmade noodles like this.

3. Their \"juice\" on the menu were basically cold water + some sort of power mix used in bubble tea. Extremely sweet and had an artificial aftertaste. Nonetheless, I was given no choice to chug it down since their water had a disgusting tap water taste.

4. Ordered the Takoyaki, tasted pretty good, however I was disappointed by the amount of octopus per dumpling balls, contemptible.

5. I will never return, and I would suggest you ramen fans to try out Imadake or Kazu. For an extra 4$, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Sumo Ramen is a decent ramen shop/izakaya located in Chinatown. I had the Sumo Miso Ramen and the portions was average, not too filling but it won't let you walk away feeling hungry. The pork was nice and fatty but lacked any real seasoning to it, so it tasted a bit bland. The broth was not too rich, so if you like your ramen broth heavy, this is not the place. Ingredients were limited however in what was an otherwise, decent bowl of ramen."}
{"text":"They do a decent job with their ramen, but I feel like they give us customers too many options. I think they can narrow down the offering quite a bit and just focus on executing those options. Had the Sumo Ramen with the Shoyu base. It was good and got the job done. If making your own ramen is your thing, they have that too. The grilled squid balls were nice."}
{"text":"Came here before but hadn't been back in a few years. I've recently acquired an obsession with ramens, perhaps due to over-indulging on pho over the years, I guess the miso broth just gets me. 

Anyway, my boyfriend and I came here last sunday after a day at the spa. We ordered the deep fried chicken as a starter, he got the seafood ramen and I got the tofu. First of all, the chicken was out of this world! So delicious. And I was bummed that my boyfriend kinda slayed the entire plate before I could have any more (scoff... men) but the ramens were delicious as well. 

Service was fast, courteous, we really enjoyed our experience... until we got home with tummy aches and taking turns going to the bathroom. It was... kinda of a shitty end to our agreeable beginning but these things happen. I definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves ramens and appetizers and having many options.. What happens after is between you and your toilet."}
{"text":"I expected something a bit better from Sumo Ramen. We had gyoza (kinda tasteless) and 2 ramen bowls (pretty ok but we've had better in Montreal, at Ramen Ya specifically. There's few vegetarian options which was also surprising given the nature of the food, usually I have more than 1-2 choices.

Overall, decent place. Nothing really negative to say about it, there's just better options for this type of food."}
{"text":"Great ramen in Montreal! Order tofu ramen with vegetarian miso broth and it was quite the delight!! My husband throughly enjoyed his mushroom ramen and the octopus balls!! In addition, we enjoyed this meal with a Taro bubble tea, yummy!!"}
{"text":"Sumo Ramen, attracted me while walking down St Laurent, by the cute little logo they had on the sign outside.  I decided to give it a try one day and I was pleasantly surprised to say the least.  The ramen isn't really authentic Japanese ramen, but rather a fusion with Chinese food.  They also have a number of side dishes and appetizers to try as well including popcorn friend chicken, which is one of my favourites.

The ramen itself is pretty well made and they have multiple options for types of broth and toppings.  The food comes out super quick and the servers are very nice and constantly come to fill up your drinks.  I would say the ramen noodles are similar to what you would get at your standard bubble tea shop, but with better toppings and broth.

The price is also very cheap, so it's not going to hurt the pocket by any means.  I'll definitely be dropping by again when I'm around the Montreal Chinatown!"}
{"text":"I instantly regretted not going to one of the many Chinese noodle places on the same street when I got my bowl of \"Sumo Ramen.\"  The flavor was bland, the bowl was small, and the meat was 1/2 fat.  The appetizers were mediocre and small and whereas I could get a fantastic meal elsewhere for $20, i was left still hungry and yearning for flavor.  Thankfully I stuffed myself with egg tarts later in the evening and felt better!  The atmosphere was nice though and 'trendy'.  The patrons were all young people - probably people who like myself didn't know any better and were drawn to the cutsy name, cartoon logo, and trendiness."}
{"text":"Not real Japanese ramen noodles. I also had the grilled squid which was OK and the gyoza. I would go elseware for ramen!"}
{"text":"We've had ramen in Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong and Szechuan province and Sumo Ramen ranks among the best authentic Chinese ramen we've ever had. This is China Town's hidden gem with a bountiful selection with very fresh ingredients and authentic recipes. We were amazed and that never happens. Try the beef ramen, it's incredible. 

The dumplings are hand made, very light and crispy. Everything was clearly made from very fresh ingredients. It's a cozy spot, casual and warm, the staff is nice but it can get busy. Expect a crowd, but the service is always fast and hot. The prices were surprisingly reasonable given the fare.

The only downside is with parking. There's a paid lot practically next door but they will gouge you. Street parking is always a gamble. Still, for the meal you can expect, it's worth the extra hassle. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Solid ramen. Nice portion size. A busy, cozy restaurant. The ramen was delicious, as were the cocktails. Also, the rice balls, which my companion ordered, and I'd never had - UMAMI HEAVEN. Really tasty.

Inexpensive, tasty and lively - in Montreal's somewhat small Chinatown. Worth a visit if you are craving Ramen, and I was.!"}
{"text":"Arrived here after reading all the great reviews about the ramen here. The restaurant is located on the upper level of the Montreal Chinatown. Signage and menu was visible from the ground level so it was easy to spot. I can tell there were a lot of regulars here. Service was very quick. We had our order taken right away. We ordered the sumo ramen, seafood ramen, and gyoza. The ramen was quite bland and boring. The noodles had poor texture, the quality of the pork and \"seafood\" were not great either, and broth was salty. I did enjoy how they prepared the gyoza however the taste was not special. The restaurant felt sticky and stuffy. They sold interesting snacks and Japanese marble drinks at the cashier which was neat. Anyways, I don't think sumo lived up to its hype. I will likely not return."}
{"text":"I ordered the cold ramen with shrimps and a plate of scallops. Both of my plates were drowning in soy sauce. The cold ramen was disappointing. It was a weird assortment as they mixed the noodles with half of a boiled egg, sliced tomatoes (why?), cucumbers, oshinko(japanese radish), a small amount of fake crabs and shrimps, which by the way were tasteless. It felt and tasted very cheap."}
{"text":"Sumo Ramen. Should have went with ramen? Since my friends were trying the ramen, I went with the beef curry.  Big disappointment. It did not taste like Japanese curry I've had elsewhere. It was just yellow gravy with a tad of spiciness.  The slices of beef did not help either. It didn't look like the picture on the menu.

The ramen noodles do not look like authentic ramen, more like Chinese noodles.

We also had the okonomiyaki.  There was no description, but it taste like takoyaki in pancake form, a little bit of octopus.

They also offered bubble tea.  I don't think that's Japanese.  As some other yelpers have mentioned, this is probably a Chinese-own establishment.

The service was a little slow. It took a while for the waitress to take our orders."}
{"text":"Un peu similaire aux autres resto de ramen mais ça n'enlève pas la qualité des plats et les saveurs très présentes. Je suis souvent allé manger la et j'ai fait découvrir la place à des gens après qu'on me l'ait fait découvrir. Ça vaut le détour et puis après tu peux toujours aller te balader dans le quartier chinois et visiter les petits commerces."}
{"text":"To be honest, I've had better ramen in the city. I ordered the sumo ramen and the miso poutine. The ramen felt bland and the poutine was way too salty."}
{"text":"Easy dining on a week night with a friend. Good spot for conversation and relaxation. Lots of ramen options. It's not the best I've ever had, but it was very tasty with fresh ingredients, and I would return. The dumplings were also very good."}
{"text":"Best ramen I had in a while! :)

Excellent choice of meal, fresh, tasty, nice size... 
must try at least once."}
{"text":"I want to really love this place. First because I have an emotional tie to it and lastly because I want to see young people make a go of it.  

We come yearly for the F1 and spend a week to enjoy all that Montreal has to offer. I've been coming to China Town since 1997 first for my love of Dim Sum and second for the clothing and shoes which I find eclectic to the western ways and for the inexpensive cost of it all (this not so much anymore in costs but I digress).  

On one of my trips to a small, no tiny clothing/shoe shop That i frequented yearly, i was asked by the owner to walk with him to his new shop. It did seem like we were being taken astray but with my husband by my side I gave it a shot. We left the pedway streets and moved to st-Laurent street and I was pleasantly surprised by the great shop he had there and have been coming back every year since.  Now you might ask how this relates...well while in the store one day/year I was asked to please try their new restaurant just next door and up the stairs.  I took their card and we came back that weekend. We really did like it and try to go every year. 

Out of habit we were there again this year and it was not great; just good but barely.  Granted I keep ordering chicken wings as an appetizer if I see it. It should not matter that it's not their speciality; if they have it on the menu then it should be good.  

i had to ask where the wings were since my husband's Goyza came and some  minutes later nothing for me.  They said they were making sure it was cooked thru. Cool but.... His main meal came and a few minutes later my wings.  Ok they were not good. They were so heavily battered and obviously the oil was not clean.  Before I finished one wing my main meal came.  Ok not good. I asked for them to be put in a takeout container and they were very obliging even including the sauce (nice).  Then the mains. He had the volcano ramen which was not too bad and I tried it and agreed; a bit blnd for volcano but not bad. Then mine; the midi ramen soup.  So very very bland. I left more than half behind. 

I'm sad to say that this is not the place I remember and I hope that this was a one off and that they return to what they first were about."}
{"text":"Pas mal du tout ce petit resto de Ramen dans Chinatown. Pas les meilleurs que je n'ai eu mais tout à fait honorables. 

Je m'y suis rendue le 1er janvier, le staff (soit juste deux serveurs) était très chaleureux et efficace. En entrée: tentacules de poulpe en beignet: trop gras et beaucoup trop de pâte à beignet ce qui enlevait totalement le goût du poulpe. Mon ami a pris une salade d'algues qui était délicieuse ! 
En plat de résistance: Ramen au boeuf avec base de soja. Franchement très bien, le seul hic, il n'y avait pas de champignons Enoki à l'intérieur mais des algues pour les remplacer. La portion et pantagruesque et du coup je n'aurais pas du commander d'entrée. 
Pour mon ami, menu de Gyoza, soit raviolis japonais grillés accompagnés d'un bol de riz blanc, d'un soupe Miso et d'une petite salade de légume. Il s'est régalé !

Côté déco, si vous êtes un adepte des couleurs d'Halloween (orange et noir) alors ce resto vous plaira ! Plus sérieusement, il faudrait donné un petit coup de jeune à cet endroit. Soit déco totalement zen ou alors tout son inverse inspiration Manga un peu comme de les resto de Tokyo. La quatrième n'est donc pas ajouté du fait de l'ambiance.

Je pense aussi que Sumo Ramen vaut plus le coup pour un lunch qu'à l'heure du souper."}
{"text":"Why people find this place bad? I rather like it. The price isn't pho cheap but it's worth what it is. It's one of my fav place in china town and it's very clean. Service is good enough."}
{"text":"Ordinary miso soup based pork ramen.
The soup base was good but the pork contains too much fatty part and taste a little gamey."}
{"text":"My favorite ramen in Montreal is at Sumo Ramen.  It's cheap and their other food is also good.  It can Get crowded and loud at times but it's also a cute little place.  The service is friendly too.

Stuff to try: Yaki Onigiri (fried rice balls), Sumo Ramen, Gyoza (dumplings)"}
{"text":"Un très bon endroit pour les amoureux de la cuisine asiatique. Je dirai que cet endroit n'a clairement pas qu'une seule origine gastronomique, car on y trouve des ramens, des udons, des takoyaki, des nems... autant de plats que d'origines différentes. Mais ça n'en est pas moins bon. J'y vais à chaque fois que je séjourne à Montréal, et je ne suis jamais deçu. Le décor est agréable, atypique, le service est rapide, et la nourriture y est bonne. Le tout dans le quartier de Chinatown. Que demandez de plus ?"}
{"text":"I often run-into here for a quick ramen fix when I'm in the area walking around in the cold. Service is fast and attentive. I've tried two different types of ramen and both weekend delish. Everything else on the menu looks really good too but the ramen portions are big so i never got the chance to try anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I had eel rice combo and japanese hashbrown. The japanese hash brown has too much sauce on it. The miso soup tastes sour."}
{"text":"Nice little spot on St Laurent right in Chinatown. This isn't the greatest bowl of noodles I've ever had, but I'll give it 4 stars because this place has its heart in the right place. Doesn't look like much from the street, but when you climb the stairs you find a clean, modern, cozy little ramen-ya. 

The noodles are fine, if not terribly exciting. Tasty soy-based broth and good selection of toppings. If I lived in Montreal, I'd stop by every now and then for a quick bite."}
{"text":"While this wasn't the best ramen that I've ever had, Sumo Ramen definitely deserves major props for being one of the only restaurants to be open for lunch on Christmas Eve in Montreal. After getting turned away by at least a dozen other restaurants, my family and I were more than grateful that we finally stumbled upon this little ramen place that was actually open (Pro Tip: don't trust Open Table when booking reservations in Montreal--we made so many reservations at places that were supposedly open, but in actuality, were not GRRR). 

I ordered the Kimchi Ramen, which was definitely tasty, but not mind-blowing, like ramen I've had at some other places. I got the combo, which included a soft drink and a side--the takoyaki octopus balls--but was still hungry after. I definitely thought the portions could have been bigger. The flavor was definitely there in the soup, but the ramen itself could have been tastier. 

While my ramen was good, my brother's Volcano Poutine was better. The fries were crunchy and flavorful on their own, so when topped with the gravy, seaweed, Sriracha and cheese, they only became better. I was skeptical about how good an Asian-inspired poutine could be, but I shouldn't have been, because it was delicious.

I was definitely initially deterred from coming to Sumo Ramen because of the 3-star rating, but I'm glad my family and I stopped by for lunch on Christmas Eve. Thanks again for actually being open and for feeding this lot of ravenous Asians, Sumo Ramen!"}
{"text":"Contrary to other comments, the service I had was good! Prompt, friendly service - what more could I ask for? The food was delicious. We tried the pork belly steamed bun and the grilled chicken steamed bun - they were served hot. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The steamed buns were a win! I ordered the Kimchee Ramen with shoyu broth, handmade ramen noodles and Chashu pork - the pork was so tender and so good. The broth was flavorful and the portion was generous. I will be back!"}
{"text":"*Must Try: Takoyaki!
*get Beef Ramen, or Sumo Ramen. Bowls are huge!
*bubble tea is milky, but good.
*very friendly and attentive servers."}
{"text":"The best Ramen in Montreal ! We went here on a cold weekday night.
It was fun going up the steps to the second floor to find a very nicely decorated resto with characters of Sumo wrestlers all over the walls.  The Gyoza (Japanese Ravioli) was a standout- off the chain good ! The grilled calamari very nicely done and served with mayonaise, I've not seen this before. The Ramen soup bowl was tasty and especially filling with accompanying fried chicken. I like to give this more stars, but, my standard is the legendary Katana-ya in San Francisco, where I slurped my way through the best bowl of Ramen outside of Japan. Sumo was quite the bargain about $22 per person including sake. If your in Chinatown this is an enthusiastic GO.!!"}
{"text":"Many choices of ramen ! Their apetizers are also very good :) My favourites are the beef stew ramen and the cha chu pork apetizer. Good size and they take cards. The only reason why I do not give them 5 stars is because of the service... I always get the same waitress who has a bad attitude"}
{"text":"(I've tried this place 3-4 years ago, wasn't impressed, tries again 1 week ago, wish I went to elsewhere instead)

To sum, Not that bad, but for the price, I rather go somewhere else. 

This place should've been called \"Sumo expensive chinese noodle a la japonaise\"

This is one of those average chinese cheap eat place that tries to pass itself as a authentic ramen restaurent so they can charge more.

The ingredients are not fresh nor carefully prepared to match that full flavor broth, well-marinated ramen eggs, or savory and succulent meat that you find in the usual ramen places. In fact, it just taste bland and MSG ladden. Furthermore, do not expect any resemblance as to authenticity.

The portion ain't that spectacular either for the price that they charge.

The service is long and minimal. We waited for about 40 minutes for the food to arrive, at 5:30pm, on a tuesday, of a working week, even though the restaurent isn't exactly packed.

The decors look fantastic and exotically japanese though, too bad everything else just screams below average and expensive chinese restaurent. 

Personally, I love authentic and good chinese food and I love authentic and good japanese food, and though the lack of authenticity isn't that much of deal breaker, but the lack of good quality make this restaurent meh."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by here during our vacation because she was craving ramen. We nearly missed the place even though there is a big sign hanging on the building. If you are going to come here, it's really easy to miss as the restaurant is upstairs. (If you want to skip this long review and want just an overall rating, go to the end)

When we walked upstairs, we were promptly greeted by a waitress and seated. I ordered the Seafood Ramen and a Mango Juice. My girlfriend ordered the Shrimp Ramen and Peach Juice (Both of us got the pepper soup). I was pretty skeptical about the drinks due to the fact that the boba drinks I got from Montreal Chinatown sucks  (Yes, the bubble tea in Montreal pretty much sucks because it's all powder instead of fresh fruits). But, let me tell you, the drinks were very refreshing and it tasted great! The mango drink, even though it doesn't really taste like real mangoes was awesome and the peach drink actually tasted like peaches.

As for the ramen, I didn't have any doubts about how it was going to taste, and I am glad I didn't because it is some of the best ramen I have had! We are from Boston and there is a couple of shops that serves ramen, but Sumo Ramen has to take the cake. The noodles has a great elasticity, the soup wasn't too thick, tasted great and all the ingredients complemented each other. One thing I can complain about is that the seafood was too bland. The scallops were cooked perfectly, but they could have sauteed it and added a bit more flavors, same for the shrimp. My girlfriend didn't have any complaints either and she finished her whole bowl...even though I think she usually does.

So, if you're craving for some ramen or just want to try it, Sumo Ramen is definitely the go-to place for that. I guarantee that you won't be dissapointed. You should definitely try some of the fruit juices that they have, although I'm not sure about their bubble tea drinks, it seems like they use powder as well. My girlfriend says it was okay and it's not SO good that you want it everyday, BUT, I say she's wrong and I wouldn't mind having it everyday! Hope she doesn't read this..."}
{"text":"Les ramens sont tout simplement délicieuses ! Belle ambiance, endroit bien situé, je recommande +++"}
{"text":"after reading the reviews on yelp, my boyfriend and i decided to give this place a try, especially since we are on a mission to try ramen in every city we visit.

we were really excited, as when we were in NYC, we had really good ramen. 

listening to the reviews we started off with the gyoza appetizer - which was not as good as everyone says it is. It was pan fried with the thin layer of skin, but there was an aftertaste of soap water. Which I should have known, since the glass of water they served us was disgusting!

We had ordered the jumbo sumo ramen - beware, it is a very big bowl of noodles, which we did not expect.

The sumo ramen came with a half boil egg, seaweed, pork belly, and other veggies. The noodles and pork belly was good. Soup was tasteless.

Definitely would not go back again."}
{"text":"Very good Ramen with lots of unique meat options (spicy beef was good).. However I was really looking forward to the volcano Poutine however the 1007 upstairs location doesn't have this.. Some other location owned by the same owners does? Shucks.."}
{"text":"Sympathique endroit pour un bon ramen et takoyaki.

Les ramens sont bien, ce n'est pas les meilleurs, mais nous ne sommes pas au Japon non plus. Il y a plusieurs variations aux choix ; bouillons, nouilles, viandes, etc.

Il y a d'autres plats que du ramen, mais j'y vais toujours que pour ça. J'aime accompagner mon plat avec des takoyakis. Une sorte de boule de pâte frite avec des morceaux de poulpe/pieuvre) ou des croquettes. C'est comme une mccroquette, mais avec des patates, des légumes et de la viande hachée (très peu ici).

Pour le prix, j'aime bien. C'est raisonnable et agréable. C'est un restau style salle à manger, mais jamais trop bruyant.

Mais, on ne saura jamais sans essayer sois-même !"}
{"text":"Considering the reviews, I was expecting more. Not authentically Japanese - Japanese/Chinese with the ability to select fusion combination bowls of noodles and noodle types. Located upstairs, not too big and was still able to accommodate large groups. About 15 minutes before they took my order was even acknowledged after being seated. Food came fairly quickly. Strange gyoza without the sides being sealed and definitely \"limp\". Contents partially falls out as you dip into the sauce. For my volcano ramen with pork broth, meat pieces are way too small to eat together with the noodles (normally meat is sliced thinly) so had to use the spoon (noodle experts know we slurp the noodles and not have to use the spoon) yet still flavourful. Not the true egg one gets in an authentic noodle house. Spoon was too big and awkward. Cash/debit only. You pay on the way out and that server was incredibly polite. At least here, I was not looked down on for speaking English and not French."}
{"text":"This is one of the closest ramen places to my apartment so I come here sometimes when I have ramen cravings. The restaurant is up some tall-ish stairs off the street so you have to lookout for the sign outside. It's generally not very busy inside and the service is pretty fast. I've gotten ramen from here to-go and not to-go. 

The ramen broth and noodles are good and. I generally get the miso broth which is nice and salty. I've had the kimchi ramen which adds a nice kick. The main issue is that the chasu pork is super dry and lacks flavor. I keep forgetting this and ordering it, but I want to try their other meats in hopes that they will be better. 

Last time I was here my husband and I split some pork baos. We were skeptical because they seemed expensive (they were presented as a meal, but we split them in addition to our ramen) and they were actually huge and pretty good."}
{"text":"first time i went it was good but the service was a little slow but now it's better i recommand for all japanese food lovers to go there :)"}
{"text":"Just awful. Worst ramen ever...if you can even call it that. Packaged ramen tastes better!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for delicious Japanese foodz, whether it's in my home cities - Boston and Montreal or when I'm on a day trip to New York City, or touring through the  West Coast; though I'm quite satisfied with my sushi and yakitori finds, I always felt a lack of great ramen-ness in my Japanese food experience. 

Though I cannot comment on its authenticity, since I don't consider myself a ramen expert. A bowl of sizzling hot and spicy volcano ramen at Sumo is delicious and satisfying. The menu is comprised picking your choice of noodle, soup and then 'toppings'. I took the volcano soup (spiciest on the menu, naturally) with ground pork, topped with scallions and seaweed, and being Chinese, I committed the sin of taking Chinese noodles in ramen. I love the flavor of the broth, intense but not overly rich and the perfect spiciness is numbing and warms the heart (perfect for a winter day in Montreal). The noodles are delicious, perfect texture and consistency. I quickly gobbled down the whole (giant) bowl of noodles.

I thought the ramen prices were reasonable, but other appetizers (i.e. yakitori) seems rather expensive for the portions. Overall, it was a yummy experience for me and I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"When I first started my journey to find the best ramen, sumo ramen was the best place. However, after going to Japan and discovering so many other ramen places, going there again made me very disappointed. We even had a deal with our club, but they are so greedy that they wont allow any discount unless we come in very large group. Their ramen is oversalted instead of having that deep, rich flavour that all Japanese ramen have."}
{"text":"Delicious broth and gyoza,  generous portions and cheap prices.   What more could you want from a ramen restaurant?"}
{"text":"This isn't the Ramen I lived on in University. Sumo Ramen is one of my favorite lunch and late evening places. When I worked in the old port I would wonder over at least once every couple of weeks for a cheap, fast and easy lunch.

Sumo Ramen has an extensive menu with something for every palette, from the veggie Gyoza's to the multiple meat and broth choices and the bubble tea who can forget the bubble tea, my favorite! Now keep in mind this is not fancy Japanese cuisine, it's good lunchtime or quick evening fare. If you're looking for higher end Japanese food give http://www.yelp.ca/biz/imadake-pub-japonais-montreal or even http://www.yelp.ca/biz/kazu-montreal, I promise you won't be disappointed. But for a quick lunch Sumo Ramen won't disappoint.

The service here is like it is at most places in Chinatown quick and efficient but don't expect allot of conversation. My only complaint and the reason why I only gave them three stars is that once you've place your order it sometimes very difficult to get  someones attention if you want something else. Other then that the service is adequate, specially considering what your lunch will cost. 

Give this place a try if your in the neighborhood and need a place to stop for lunch give Sumo Ramen a try it's worth a try."}
{"text":"Amazing prices and great ramen!! I ordered the volcano ramen as is and it was really tasty. So much food for such a low price! The food is super tasty and the prices can't be beat. I stopped by here on a Tuesday night and it was still bustling. I can imagine that it gets very crowded on the weekend. They accept credit cards (not Amex) and there's an ATM if you need to grab cash. This place is located at the far end of Chinatown and up a staircase lined with Christmas lights. I highly recommend if you like ramen and are in the area!"}
{"text":"I doubt I will be eating there again. The meat wasn't as fresh as other places and the vegetable broth was saltier than I anticipated. So I can only imagine how salty the other broths are."}
{"text":"Our first meal in Montreal as it was cold and we didn't want to stray far from the hotel. It was a letdown. We ordered the grilled squid balls (these were good) and of course ramen. I had the miso ramen and hubby the shoyu ramen. I never thought ramen could be bland but they achieved that here, the broth didn't have that rich porky taste of tonkotsu ramens and even the miso was extremely one note. There are much better choices in Montreal don't waste your time & food quota here."}
{"text":"I'll admit it. I came here because Naruto likes ramen and I've rarely had it outside those really cheap bags of noodles you boil when you're in college. Or at work for lunch. I was a solo lunch diner, as I had dipped out of a conference for some better food than the conference center was offering. This place delivered. It was clean and the service was FAST. The ramen was delicious, and the recommendation of the server was spot on. Decor was modern and had several nods to anime. If I lived in the area I would probably be back here. Naruto was right, ramen is yummy!"}
{"text":"Les ramen sont vraiment mauvais ! Aucune différence entre le miso et le soja. Le poulet frit est insipide. Par contre le service est très sympa ! A éviter, surtout avec la horde de bons restaurants autour."}
{"text":"Soupe boeuf braisé épicé ! Succulent! Mais la soupe en elle-même un peu trop épaisse à mon goût. 
Avec en entrée des anguilles et des raviolis frits.

Les raviolis plutôt léger en goût, un peu ordinaire.
Les anguilles... Un must! Sucré salé impeccable.

Le service est impeccable pour un petit restaurant, parle français et anglais.

Prix correct. Très bon rapport qualité prix.

Toilettes propres et papier hygiéniques de qualité :-). Pas le truc simple non moltonné... Le truc doux et absorbant que tu as chez toi! Jamais vu ça dans un restaurant!"}
{"text":"I had their seafood ramen and their chicken curry rice dish. Portion sizes, price and taste was adequate. Cozy interior, but very tight space between tables. Very noisy because of this. OK experience."}
{"text":"Hidden somewhere in Chinatown, this place was my first ramen place back then. What I like about this place is that they offer the biggest bowl of ramen (jumbo) I've ever seen! It makes me want to roll down the stairs after everytime I order one. As for the taste, they're subpar compared to other ramen shops. Their broth could be a lot creamier and richer. Also their service is nothing noteworthy."}
{"text":"Awesome ramen soups! Cheap, nothing too fancy but really tasty! 

The raviolis are ok but nothing to die for. 

Udon noodles and pepper broth are really good. Its a really nice spot for lunch or quick dinner. 

Cheap and spicy!!

Love."}
{"text":"This restaurant is perfect for a quick lunch or to meet up with friends. They have a nice ramen selection and boy it's good. I like that they have a good choice of starters, takoyaki is my favorite. The ramen broth was delicious and filling. Definitely worth a visit if you're looking for inexpensive lunch place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good ramen noodle experience in Montreal's Chinatown, I highly recommend Sumo Ramen. I had the wanton ramen in spicy hot pepper broth which I found flavorful and absolutely satisfying. The Imperial Rolls were quite good as was the dipping sauce they were served with. I wouldn't hesitate to return and try some of their other menu selections on a future visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"Ramen is not that good to me, seems like something that you can buy from a supermarket. And the miso soup is too salty, literally."}
{"text":"Sumo Ramen was a pretty good experience- I had never been to a place that sold solely ramen until I went there.

The server was very nice and friendly. He made suggestions for appetizers. We decided on octopus balls. I've never had those either until then. They were pretty good!

The ramen is also very good. It was a bit blend for me but they do have sauces on the table for extra taste to it."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: It's a little restaurant on a second floor that can only be noticed if you really pay attention to the signs outside. The inside is on the smaller side. There are a few anime posters hanging on one side but that's really the only decor the restaurant offers.

FOOD: I personally like the food here. I usually order the fried chicken ramen (the chicken comes on the side) and I really enjoy it. The broth isn't too salty and the noodles are nice and tender. I also usually get the takoyaki (octopus balls) and those are decent as well.

PRICE: Prices aren't bad, especially for the large portions you'll be getting. I do find their price for takoyaki a little expensive but their prices for ramen are affordable.

SERVICE: A-okay, the staff do what they're supposed to do."}
{"text":"stopped by during my trip to montreal and had the vermicelli noodles w shoyu soup and wontons (not that tasty, pretty plain imo) and the gyoza. i LOVED the gyoza!!! i wish i ordered two for myself instead of getting the noodles lol. can't say anything about the other ramen options but from what i've experienced, it's not very flavorful."}
{"text":"I took the spicy ramen mmmm feel so good in a freeze day. Crowdy place, good service."}
{"text":"Ok so this place was bookmarked as a to try, and now I have give you the scoop, was it good? was it worth seeking out? ya know answers. Located on the second floor  at 1007 (James Bond anyone), on St Laurent we walked, in on that same sunny day, (see other review) and found ourselves in a almost full place with very content looking patrons.  We started out ordering what we assumed was some of their best sellers, (we based our decision on product placement on the menu, not scientific I know but you kinda get a feel for it by where and how often a dish is displayed.
So Japonese raviolis, and fried chicken.   The fried chicken bits, were really good, the portion was much more filling then expected so beware or like us you may fill up on these.  The raviolis were very good too if,   A you like raviloli/ dumpling (which is not my case), or B if you like cabbage (which was not the case of my dining partner), so you can see how we may have misordered...

Then come the mains, if having a Ramen you choose your soupe base (Pepper, Miso, Soya), I went for the miso with the Ramen Volcano and my dining partner went for the seafood with :Pepper base.  You can also choose the noodle and we chose Udan.  Mine was superb, it was hot (you can see the  pepperflakes on the surface), but still really savory, and really brimming with pork, corn ,mushroom,half a egg,lots of noodles, and some greens.  I ended up taking half home and managed to make two more small meals out it, it is huge and filling.
The other one with the seafood was very tasty as well, but had a more creamy, fresh taste, which actually reminded me a little of the flavor one will get when eating a soup with coconut milk in it, making the dish quite the oppsite of mine.

We ordered some cold Saki, were very well taken care of by the friendly and efficient wait staff, while we chatted away.  We ended up paying about 45 dollars each, (including tax and generous tip), which was quite reasonable given that almost half the bill was for the bottle of Sake,  I am happily adding this to the must tell people to try list, so enjoy."}
