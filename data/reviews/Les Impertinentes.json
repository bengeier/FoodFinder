{"text":"Found this spot on a recent cafe kick in Montreal and really enjoyed the space. I went in the middle of the afternoon and found the atmosphere relaxing and calm. The menu was full of healthy salads, dishes and smoothies and the coffee was solid.

I will say that aside from being next to a ballet studio/store, there was little that was unique about the decor of the cafe. It could have been any other cookie cutter \"cute\" cafe. The tables seemed kind of sparse so if it gets crowded be prepared to look elsewhere for seating and there aren't many outlets besides one near the alcove beside the bar and one in the wall. They could do with a few extension cords or making plugs more available for laptop workers. We had to negotiate plug use with a nearby table. 

Overall cute vibe but really highly depends on who's in the cafe and who's not. You can hear the occasional crying baby since they have mom/tot classes but that's not too common."}
{"text":"I discovered Les Impertinentes at a networking event in the Mile-End. I was struck by the freshness of the products served and I made it a mission to visit their restaurant.

Fast forward to a few months later on a Sunday morning, while I was in the neighborhood I noticed the little boutique/restaurant and took the opportunity to visit.

Les Impertinentes is a little vegan-vegetarian caf√© with a very soothing and relaxing atmosphere (green has that effect on me). I was with my son, who is not very receptive to the notions of freshness and glutenfree stuff, so he simply ordered a  \"Jeanne\" juice made of strawberry, beetroot, apple and mint with a vegan brownie. I ordered a guacamole and Cajun shrimps toast with a mocha.

My son did not like his juice because it was not sweet enough to his taste but I was more than happy to drink it: it was really light with a good fruity taste. My toast was excellent, they were very generous on the shrimps which were very well seasoned. My son has almost eaten all of it and he is not a fan of guacamole!

The service was excellent, the food was fresh and very good, there is an excellent wifi connection ... what more can you ask for? We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I discovered this cafe while on a walk with a couple of friends. It's next door to a ballet studio and what caught our eye was all the little succulents scattered around the cafe. There is a cute little alcove for you to sit in towards the back of the cafe. It's small but there are enough tables for a good amount of people. I enjoyed my tea and cookie and service was great. They also offer sandwiches and salads. Will definitely return if I'm in the area again."}
