{"text":"Excellent diner food. Especially breakfast. You can tell that they cook the food with love. Patty melts are my favorite there and I highly suggest ordering their fries! They're battered so they're crispy and crunchy on the outside and soft and hot in the middle. My husband recommends the meat lovers skillet as well as the Friday fish fry. So good! The atmosphere is quaint and comfortable but they could use a remodel because it's a little run down. Basic diner though. Great service too! Friendly staff and the food comes fast and hot."}
{"text":"This five star rating is going specifically to the Mexican Speciality dishes at the Corner Cafe. In a small, \"corner of the menu\" there are four simple Mexican plates that are delicious, you have to try them. We have a hidden gem in Belleville for true, authentic Mexican food fans. No cheese sauce or bland salsas here, only fresh pico de gallo and savory, complex red salsa with lots of depth and not an overwhelming amount of heat. The beans and rice that come on the side are really authentic and yummy. Make sure you order a side of red or green sauce with the chimichanga or burrito (they don't come smothered). The fajitas are served with fresh corn tortillas, the meat and veggies are perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the guacamole is so good. The chips are made fresh, too. Thick and crunchy and seasoned perfectly to go with the great salsa. We always do take-out because the atmosphere is not too exciting; however, the staff is very nice. If you're stopping through town, this is a great option for Mexican food with few options in town these days OR if you're from here, check out something new on the menu you may have been missing out on!"}
{"text":"If I could give it less stars I would. Food was good, typical breakfast nothing special. Service is HORRIBLE, they literally have no clue that they are working in or running a restaurant. While we were here 4 tables of people and a party of 18 got up and left because everything takes so long."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service at this cafe. Our party of four waited over an hour for our food (all easy breakfast foods that should have been fairly ready as it was Sunday morning). The servers were not communicative nor apologetic about the late service; we had to seek them out for more coffee, water, or information about our food's status. Eventually they started blaming it on a large party of six that came in just before us, but that party waited a long time for their food, too. 

When our food finally came--after about an hour and ten minutes of waiting--my biscuits of the biscuits and gravy dish were still frozen in the middle. By this time, we couldn't wait any longer for them to remake the dish because we had to drive 40 minutes back to Madison. I took a couple bites of my eggs and hash browns, and those were cold, too, but I was so hungry at that point. After those few bites, I lost my appetite and left the plate largely untouched. 

When I told the server (owner?) that my biscuits were frozen, no I couldn't wait for them to remake it, and that I wanted this item removed from our bill, she asked, 'but you're eating the hash browns?' I responded that I only took a couple bites because I was so hungry. When the bill came, she only took half off the biscuits and gravy dish because of those few bites of hash browns and eggs! She absolutely refused to comp the dish and was utterly dramatic and rude about it. 

I do not recommend eating here not only because of the subpar food but because of the poor service and rude servers. If you're in Belleville and need a place to eat, drive elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food was good for the price we paid. We had the fish and a burger.  We would like to give them 4 stars but the service was the worst we have had in years. If we would have been in a hurry we would have left before ordering. We waited 5 minutes to be seated, no water or silverware were brought to our table, we had to ask. The waitress took 15 minutes to come to our table and take our order and did not know the menu items when asked questions.  She never checked up on us to see if we needed anything or refill our drinks which were empty 1/2 way through our meal. Perhaps it was her first day on the job with no prior service experience?  We will probably give this place one more try."}
