{"text":"it's been a year since our last visit, this place has gone through lots of changes! Food is delicious and clean ,service is fast and good. Love the idea of the grill! try curry plus spicy sauce and Japanese bbq mix! They also have  free  bubble tea for the month! I also like the ice desert and chocolate fountain!"}
{"text":"This is an all you can eat affair. Don't know the name but their main thing is a build your own dish (pick from a large assortment of veggies, meats and sauces give to chef who cooks it for you on this 6-8 for wide circular flat top stove) which is incredible... and the food too. And there is also a good size buffet that is well with exploring. And even though I go overboard, I try to stay close to the boat."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and the kids love it here. They get to make their food and we test their food in the master chef style."}
{"text":"Mongolian Grill is a good place to eat with friends or a group.  I have been here for lunch a few times with groups from work and I think they have something for everyone - seafood, veg, different meats, styles and spice.  I think what I like most about this place is that theres many different things you can try - sauces, ingredients, etc and every time it tastes a little different ... now if your boring, i guess your selection will be boring, but eating here gives you an opportunity to eat something a little different and taste the various flavours from Mongolia?   I think the price for the buffet is a little expensive - $20 per person i think?? but the experience is nice."}
{"text":"LOVE the fact that I can create my own stir fry! All the veggies I want? Yes please. The already made up food is just okay. Not a big selection at all but I guess it works for some people. Personally I don't even touch that part of the buffet, its all about the create your own. Dessert is okay... my boyfriend loves the cotton candy ice cream. I like the chocolate fondue(strawberries,pineapple,marshmallows). The staff is very attentive. They're always there to take the dishes away and replace napkins and fill water glasses. Also a very good value for lunch . I believe its $12.99. Ive never been there for dinner because I find it too expensive-over $20.00, not worth it to me."}
{"text":"I never take the time to review a restaurant, but the food I received was so bad I felt compelled to warn others.   This was by far the most revolting chinese food I have ever had in Toronto.. scratch that, it was the most revolting food I have ever had in my life. period."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and prompt service. Good for large parties and families. Very spacious and ample space between tables. Wide selection on the grill-think stir fry but upgraded-although note to go easy on the chili paste if you are a spicy food lover like myself Wide selection of dim sum and appetizers, and great presentation, although some foods were not as authentic (steamed veggie dumplings, kung pao fish, chicken fried rice) but guess they had to cater to different taste buds.  Recommend the chicken wings, custard buns; for dessert, try their coconut taro with red bean and almond tofu and juice bomb toppings; make-it-yourself slushie station is popular amongst kids although adults like myself were tempted to help ourselves to a serving as well Chocolate fountain is quite impressive but more selection of fruits that are less sweet would be a nice touch-strawberries and banana for example  Overall good experience-would come again"}
{"text":"The first time we went it was lunch.  For $12 it was fun to make our own stir fries.  I must admit, I was a little confused about the concept at first, so gave up and moved on to the buffet.  The buffet was average, nothing great but for the price, OK...and then I went up for a second run at this str fry thing.  This time around a server came and helped me, enthusiastically filling my bowl and directing me to the grill.  The chef was quiet but energetic.  The stir fry was great; I loved being able to add some extra spice!  We finished with an average dessert and I left with a 4/5 experience.  A couple weeks later we returned for dinner.  We figured for $20 this time we may be in for something extra, like crab legs or something...  It was the same thing, only this time the servers and chef all seemed slow and depressed to be there. There were two tables of guests, us and another couple.  After feeling ripped off on the dinner, I probably won't return for a while, if ever."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to give 4 stars only because of the inconsistency, I find that every time I go the buffet section is either great or meh. Specifically the hot foods. The Mongolian grill part is amazing though! Although it is tough to know how your food will taste once you've douced it in every sauce. But maybe that's just me.  Big difference in lunch vs dinner price and what's in the menu. Definitely worth trying it once. It's great for large parties or you have people from out of town visiting."}
{"text":"If you know how Genuine Mongolian food is like, don't come to this one, if you just want some random Chinese food, it worth a visit."}
{"text":"This is one buffet that I actually don't mind.  I've been here twice for lunch (weekday), the price is reasonable at 10.99.  The food is fresh, everything is clean.   I mainly eat the pick-your-own stir fry.  You select meat, veggies, sauces and they cook it in front of you.  There is a really large selection of everything. They also have lamb, which I really liked.    In the regular buffet section, its nothing special."}
{"text":"I love this place and have been several time!  The concept of having a healthy meal prepared in front of you is very appealing!  The option for having Chinese food buffet is a great secondary option when the lines get busy for the Mongolian style meal.  The only downside (as far as I recall) is I believe the meal is more expensive if you go in the evening or on the weekend.  This concept has always seemed silly to me.  Definitely recommended for a good meal!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with my dad for Father's Day. He suggested it and I have never heard of it so I was intrigued to go.  Basically they have 2 rows of pre-made food that you can choose from at any time, I got the lychee shrimp and the pepper beef both were really good. Then you get in this line where you pick your meat (choice of lamb, beef, chicken or pork), then you pick your vegetables, then noodles then whatever sauce you want. There are about 6 already made ones and then there is a section where you can make your own sauce. They the put it on a huge flat top and cook it.  I had two different bowls I both really enjoyed, its not so hard to think about what will go with each other, it's pretty much whatever you like and some common knowledge.  I really liked the celery and pineapples both were a bit off the beaten track but didn't get mushy on the flat top and tasted good with the teryaki.  The service was great, very speedy always asking us if we wanted refills or help building our bowls in line. Very hospitable.  The total came to 61 bucks with tax, but we got $40 in coupons at the end of the night so it was basically just taxes and drinks we paid for.  Overall a great place to go and mix and match, try some new creations."}
{"text":"GK Mongolian Grill is all about it's ayce stir fry. With a large selection of meat, vegetables, noodle types, and sauces, you can spend your entire time here creating endless combinations of stir frys that are pretty good. But don't be mistaken, this restaurant also offers a decent buffet selection and dessert bar that stands to impress.   Food (4/5): I truly enjoyed making my own stir fry here and found that you can easily fill up on bowl after bowl. The selection of what you can put in your stir fry is honestly the star here and what makes this place truly unique. Their buffet selection is pretty decent considering the Mongolian grill takes up about half the food space, however don't expect a hot/cold food offering that lives up to Mandarin or Dragon Pearl. On a another note, I really enjoyed their dessert bar. The bingsu machine and the hot chocolate fountain were a major plus! Again, their dessert bar is limited but c'mon chocolate fountain AND make-your-own bingsu in one sitting was a bonus :D  Cost (3.5/5): $32.99 + tax + tip for fridays and the weekends. If you're up at their grill a decent amount of time I'd say it's a pretty standard price for what you get.   Service (3.5/5): Standard here, nothing special. Waters when we needed it, didn't take long to get the bill.   Ambiance (3.5/5): It's a spacious and clean restaurant that's good for large groups. It was slightly dark for my liking, but nevertheless you are by no means cramped however at peak hours (dinner) the lineup for the grill could get quite long."}
{"text":"Pretty good selection of Chinese food, as well as a grill station for freshly grilled DIY bowl and a variety of sauces. There's a chocolate fountain too!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in my neighbourhood. Did my birthday dinners here twice I think.   Service is very efficient.   If you're like me and love stir steamed veggies (like stir fry but without the oil). You'll love this spot.   You can choose your veggies, your meat and your sauce and voila you have what I call stir steamed veggies within under 2 minutes.   Haven't really tried anything but their salads in their buffet section of the menu. Their salads are good."}
{"text":"Great selection, service was fantastic, wonderful atmosphere.  Will definitely be returning.  Not sure what you like, try the predefined menu options, or get creative with your own.  Just watch the spicy stuff at the end, don't use too much!"}
{"text":"Visited GKMG for a family member's birthday dinner on a Sunday. We made reservations for 4:30pm and were promptly seated.   Service: friendly and attentive Definitely a couple of notches better than most AYCE Asian restaurants. Servers brought extra napkins without being asked. Empty dishes were quickly cleared. Servers love kids and kept coming over to talk to our toddler. Our bill was brought over as soon as we asked for it (which seems trite but all too often we've been at hipster or fine dining places where it all falls apart at the end of service!).  Food: well-prepared, good selection There is both the buffet area as well as the Mongolian grill area. The buffet has 3 rows  including your typical Chinese buffet stuff (dim sum, general tao chicken, etc.), a cold bar (including smoked salmon, seaweed salad, shrimp) and desserts (ice cream, flan, profiteroles, etc.). The Mongolian grill is the \"feature\" of the restaurant, where you assemble your own ingredients and the grill-master dude cooks it on a giant circular grill. Kudos to the management for making this part fail-proof and fun. There are clear signs and a guide is there to help at any point. The ingredients were varied and plentiful. The only downside is that the final product is rather bland so I would advise anyone to put in more than the suggested 1 scoop of sauce.  Venue: nicely lit, large and clean. Tables are well-space apart and doesn't feel crammed like some buffet joints. I'm not sure if it less busy on Sundays, but I liked the calm vibe. Ladies' WC was very clean.   Overall, a really good experience. It is a little pricey ($160 for 4 adults and 2 kids - including taxes, tips and alcohol), but worth doing for a special occasion or family outing."}
{"text":"I came here with a bunch of the coworkers during lunch.  I've eaten at many mongolian type places before so I know  the routine.  It's an AYCE place for the Mongolian grill and they have a separate aisle that serves up your typical your Americanized Chinese food like your sweet so-wa pok and broccoli beef, egg rolls, and whatever you think of.  This place had a lot of options and shit so many sauces to try that when i got to the sauce part of the area I just stood there confused.  I didn't know what to use so I just started to pour a little bit of everything.  I still came out really good.  I had two bowls and left with a food coma.  So much for being productive for the remainder of the day."}
{"text":"I have taken-out from here a few times and love it. Their black bean shrimp is delicious and plentiful."}
{"text":"I came here with some family after we noticed that there was a mongolian grill in the city. Originally hailing from Waterloo, I was a huge fan of the one back home and naturally I thought it would be the same.  However, this place was something of a mixed bag.  For those of you that don't know, the way you eat at the Mongolian Grill is to fill an empty bowl with all sorts of raw meats, vegetables, sauces and spices and the cooks there will stir fry it before your very eyes. This place had a huge selection of foods including a pretty diverse selection of seafood; something the waterloo location was lacking.  Furthermore, there was a substantial addition to this location by means of a typical buffet. So not only did you have the option to eat your own stir fry, but you also had the choice of a typical buffet to keep you full.  And yet, there was something definitely lacking. The choices of raw foods seemed smaller, there was little customizing options by way of seasonings and sauces, and food seemed... I'm not even sure, cheaper? Most of the meats and veggies were sliced, rather than in chunks.  Either way, it was a good time. I'd recommend trying it out but I'm not sure how revisitable the location is due to the admittedly steep pricing."}
{"text":"I went here during the week for lunch. It gets busy with working folks in the area - the draw is the make your own noodles.  The vegetables shrink after it is grilled, the way to do it is bring 2 bowls with you otherwise you'll have to line up again. I'm not big on all you can eat so unless you eat a lot you will get your fill.  Like Neil T said be careful about the sauces some might be too salty or too spicy."}
{"text":"Lunch on holidays and weekends, $14.99 for Adult, $8.99 for kids under 13.  Walking in at 1:00pm on a Sunday, the tables were rather empty, but soon fill up.    Dim sum is not the reason to go to this buffet.  The rest of the food is rather disappointing.  But the reason to go is for a nice stirfry meal.  I had the noodles with beef, lamb and seafood with a meddly of vegetables.  Then went back for seconds with a just vegetable stirfry.  The sauces were fantastic.   Now I know where to find my stirfy fix."}
{"text":"My family and I had made reservations here for Fathers Day after my  brother had recommended it. The pre-cooked food was rather basic but good for \"Westnernized Chinese Food\". They don't really offer a wide variety of selections so don't expect to much. The desert table is mediocre at best, they have the generic baked goods, fruits area and ice cream. I was surprised however that they had a \"Halo-halo making station\" (shaved ice in coconut milk, condensed milk, caramelized flan or custard cake, fresh fruit, your choice of jellies and toppings, etc). Being Filipino this was a nice surprise, its quality of Halo-halo incredients were actually better than most Filipino restaurants. They also have a chocolate fountain, if you're into that. But the star of the show of course is the Mongolian Grill. The selection of meat, noodles, veggies, sauces and spices are great and are consistently fresh and replenished. They also try to cook your food in a timely manner. However, it loses some ratings on waiter/waitress service considering we could barely flag one down. We had asked for refills on our drinks and waited almost 45 minutes before seeing them again and had to remind them of our refills. It was even sort of frustrating trying to get our bill. The atmosphere or ambiance is also sub-par. It does remind me of an over crowded, loud mall or school cafeteria. So if you're coming here for a fancy romantic date, quiet atmosphere, etc. This is not the place for you."}
{"text":"A friend told me about this place but I assumed it was much like the Kitchener location.  BOY WAS I WRONG. I went here on Sunday and was excitingly shocked. This place is MASSIVE!. - think Mandarin's size and THEN some.  It's got the traditional Mongolian Bbq with a vast choice of ingredients, as well as another 3 rows of chinese, fusion, buffet style.   There's something for everyone here.   The variety is help-full if your veg only. Also if your a seafood lover, you'll get your dose. I love cooking, so this place gives me the best of both worlds. I choose my own amount of garlic, pepper, no salt, sesame seed oil, spring onion, parsley. The veggies are fresh and clean. Unlike most buffet's.   The rice and noodle selection is impressive. They have a curry broth that's a bit spicy but goes great with white rice.   Also, the desert table is fun fun fun!! lots of selection plus a chocolate fountain ^_^  For the adventurous choco lovers: They have an array of cut up fruits&veggies. Take a bit of cantaloupe, melon and cucumber and let the chocolate fountain shower the pieces with LOTSoLOVE. melon covered chocolate... delicious, choco covered strawberry - That is SO 2009 . I tried to do it to a few other veggies , but the staff started to murmur around me to each other. Annoyed, I stopped.  They must not have seen the movie \"girls just wanna have fun\". geeze.   sake here is horrible!.  This place is great for big groups and birthdays. The service is quick, a bit TOO quick. They will come to you if you have more than 1 plate so be on the look out for them taking your fantastic hard laboured collection of food. I shook my fist at the bus boy. Twice. he refilled my water instead. Ughh.   Bill came up to $62.45 for 2 people. Not bad for the amount of food you get.   p.S This is NOT salad-eating-girl friendly.  I repeat. Not for those on a diet, watching weight, counting calories etc.  If you can pack it, your in.   xoxo M."}
{"text":"The buffet food was cold. When we complained, we got some excuse about how it's cooked on 100 degree Fahrenheit heat (no it is not, that food was cold). I asked for a refill on my Sprite, and after 15 minutes of not getting it, I prompted them to bring it again. Upon bringing me my Sprite, I started to drink it. The waitress then approached me, telling me that I cannot drink the Sprite, because my mother ordered the Sprite for herself, when in fact it was my Sprite. Upon requesting my bill, they charged us for four adults, counting my brother as an adult (he is a child, we had told them this twice). Overall, cold food, bitchy waitresses with attitude problems that accuse the customer of lying, a manager that just makes up excuses when a customer complains, and giving us a false bill. Do not waste your money; this was the first restaurant that we did not tip in as long as I can remember, and this action was justified."}
{"text":"The grill part is always the best part. The buffet is kinda mediocre in my opinion. I feel like the salads aren't very fresh :( Also, I find that every time I'm there, I always feel rushed by the waiters because they constantly remind me they close at 3 and we need to finish eating soon."}
{"text":"based on what i experienced, it was kind of a letdown... i tried mongolian bbq before and it was so nice and i was looking forward to it,,,   the sauces where diluted so the flavours were kind of not there... and too much things to put if you don't know how to cook or which one goes with the other, i think it's hard (because it was for me) -_-  the cooked foods in the buffet was kind of bland for me..."}
{"text":"Came here twice in the last month, once with the boyfriend for lunch, and the other time for a birthday dinner. These were my first two experiences with Mongolian grill and I have to say that I enjoyed it. I really like creating my own bowls with all of the ingredients that they offer. Their cooked food options aren't that great so the second time I just stuck to making bowls. In my opinion it's kind of like Mandarin and Korean BBQ mixed together. It's definitely not a place you would frequent often, but I would like to revisit again at some point."}
{"text":"I'm glad their strawberries were fresh this time too, I hope they keep this up because the chocolate covered strawberries are the reason I keep coming back. Also that caramel flan was delicious!  Edit: price wise, this place is only worth it during weekdays for lunch (12.99 as of 2014), but I'd probably not pay 26 for dinner at this place."}
{"text":"At the request of my younger brother, I went in search on Yelp for the best rated Mongolian BBQ place in the GTA to bring him for his birthday dinner. Try as I might I couldn't find any place better than Genghis Khan MG, so it was settled that we would give this North York spot a whirl.  Fairly easy to find and with the clear signage, it's impossible to miss on the west side of Don Mills Road between Lawrence and Eglington. Parking was a breeze for a Monday night but I feel that on busier nights and with multiple restaurants in the complex, that parking may be an issue at times.   Walking in the place IS massive. Even thought it was a slow Monday night, I could tell that even at mass capacity this place has the room...and the food, to spare. We were seated instantly and drink orders were taken. Word to the wise, avoid cocktails or mixed drinks here. Awful. The Bloody Caesar I ordered wasn't very good and was more spice and ice then anything nice. I'd say stick to beer, water or soda pop.   Moving into the buffet portion of GHMG, I was really impressed with the organized lay out for food and the overall freshness and organization of the Mongolian BBQ area. Plenty of signage explained each step of the process from meat, to why you should add veggies, the noodle station to the sauces. This is where this place wins over my previous favourite Waterloo location, instead of trying to figure out the appropriate mix and balance of herbs, sauce and oil to make a decent dressing for your dish, they have a host of pre-made sauces which explain in detail what is in each. The flavour choices were delicious and I was content not being a chef for a night. However, this being said they still offered the DIY sauce and spice station for those more creative and less hungry.   Food was cooked quickly however I felt the grill master added a tad too much water to the ingredients while cooking everything and watered down my sauces a little. Still tasted awesome so who am I but another pig at the trough getting read to stuff his little face.   In addition to the Mongolian BBQ section the do offer a fairly robust selection of Western Chinese faves (you know like chicken balls and spare ribs and spring rolls) good for the us white folk who know no difference. To me this area was passable but a nice touch as I know not everyone is down with the Mongolian bbq options.   The icing on top of this place was the dessert selection, by the time i was due to go for a tour of the dessert tables I was feel full and kept it simple. The standouts for me were the Heavenly Hash and Cotton Candy Ice Cream flavours and the fresh fruits and marshmallows to dip in the chocolate fountain.  I'd come back and I'd recommend this to anyone who is interested in doing something a little different and a little more casual for dinner with a group of people. Total bill for 5 alcoholic beverages and 5 buffet dinners was $145 + tip. So roughly $30-35/person.   Also thanks to the staff for doing the birthday cake and complimentary picture for my brother on his birthday"}
{"text":"I am surprised that they closed down, I really thought that this corner finally found a permanent resident."}
{"text":"Great value (for lunch).   I've been to several Mongolian bbq places, a few of which are AYCE. I thought that this is one of the better ones.   First of all, the meat quality was good compared to what you usually get. Not many fatty pieces. They have lamb, chicken, pork & beef. I stuck to the lamb which was great. They have a bunch of different items to add (much larger variety than I am used to, including shrimp and squid).   I'd say that the Mongolian bbq component alone would justify the price. But then they also have a fairly large Chinese section with a few different types of food including dim sum.   Desert wasn't great, but the range is bigger than what you would expect. They have a snow ice machine and a chocolate fondue station... Both nice adds.   Don't think that I'm willing to pay the dinner prices, but will definitely return for the weekday lunch ($13.95)"}
{"text":"Different kind of Cuisine and different way to prepare. Not a big fan though and expensive."}
{"text":"Great place to customize your own noodles! Selection for the DIY noodle station is really great with pretty decent ingredients. You can get 2 bowlfuls of ingredients at a time and they will cook the batch for you. As for the rest of the buffet, the selection is quite lackluster. There are a few basic meats you can expect all Asian buffet places to carry and there's some dim sum (mostly of the the bun variety). I would avoid the oysters because they have an odd tangy taste to them--and it's not the lemon. My stomach didn't have an issue with the oysters, but be warned.  The dessert area actually had a decent selection of cakes and cookies. My favourite was the chocolate fountain--which I abused quite a lot with strawberries. The chocolate covered strawberries were lovely, the chocolate hardened quite nicely over the fruit. I would recommend stringing a couple items onto one of the skewers if you're planning to dip in the fountain a lot (like me). Overall, I would recommend this place for the great fried noodles, but not the regular buffet selection."}
{"text":"Popped in again for lunch, and everything was solid, as usual.  No this is not outstanding Cantonese cuisine with impressive wok-hei nuance, this is buffet food, but for lots of fried noodles in volume, with an interesting selection of other foods to compliment, this is a solid choice.  Actually, there's been a reasonable number of changes in the prepared food selection since my last visit, including a wider range of dim sum (which was very disappointing in quality) but I appreciated the addition of General Tao chicken which was yummy, and the nice chunks of panko fried Whitefish which was quite good with tartar sauce from the squeeze bottle provided.  Favorites from the past, still available, include tasty Kung Pao fish, stir-fried garlicky green beans, and the yummy deep fried chicken wings.  The Mongolian Grill custom stir-fried food is still excellent, with a great selection of meats, vegetables, noodles, and prefab sauces, as well as all of the individual flavor components of the sauces, plus chili oil, ginger, garlic, etc. so you can custom tailor to your heart's desire.  Yes, the #1 Grill jockey still adds WAY too much water when stir-frying your selection, so make sure you double up your selected sauce quantity in the ingredient bowl, to counteract his H2O heavy-handedness, letting lots of flavor survive his water bath.  The desert selection is unimpressive, aside from some interesting self scoop ice cream flavours, their fun shaved-ice machine with a wide range of syrups and gelatinous toppings, and the chocolate fountain.  But the seasonal lack of fresh strawberries made the dipping a little less fun, this time.  All in all, a good visit, and still well worth $15 bucks for a large, decadent lunch."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. I don't eat a lot so I'm not a big fan of buffets but I got one of those deals online so I decided to check it out. It was pretty good, I didn't each much from the actual grill but the other stuff that was there. There was a nice selection of food.  Despite what one person mention the process of selecting your food is pretty easy, they have \"Chef Mixes\" for you. The plates where you get the food is small relative to the bowl you end up with, but you can take 2 bowls but I find that one is enough for me, I don't eat too much. Also the food is not too badly charcoal as she mentioned.   Because we got the coupon deal we ended up paying $36 for 2 with drinks and tips. That's pretty good deal for me.  Make sure to make reservations for priority seating."}
{"text":"Even more fun that hot pot (and I'm a massive hotpot fan), this is THE place to go if you need to binge-eat all the meat and noodles you can. And maybe greens if you still have space after the previous two. I've been dining at Genghis Khan for 12 years (both this location and the former at Pacific Mall), and every time is worth the bill - even when I have to pay for it.  You won't get bored after a dozen visits, and if you do, you're clearly not adventurous enough to try the hundreds of potential bowl combinations. That's part of Genghis Khan's genius - you simply can't get bored if you try, even if you're just pouring on pounds of meat and Satay sauce. With friends, the experience is even better; see who can pig out the fastest, and the most."}
{"text":"Enjoyed good time and food. Other than the customized cooking section (which was great)- rest of the items could be better."}
{"text":"Solid food, decent service, nice ambience, all you can eat, reasonable prices. It's not the best food in the city, but it's good value and well worth a visit.  The made-for-you stirfry is always pretty solid, but it's easy to over-complicate. Don't put too many different ingredients into one bowl, it's better with fewer items. Fun and tasty.  The buffet section used to be pretty sub-par but lately it's been better. The crystal pork belly in the plain buns is pretty nice. It's still not the best buffet food in Toronto, but it's definitely improved.  The desserts are ok, but the fruit, chocolate fountain and shaved ice machine are all good, and I'd suggest you put your emphasis on those."}
{"text":"If Mandarin met Chako that became a chocolate fondue spot at the end of the night. This is the kind of place that will definitely make you unbutton your jeans button on the ride back home. Great appetizer selection and the do it yourself Noodles are fun and satisfy your taste buds to your preference! All you can eat...Large selection of treats!"}
{"text":"Went her for lunch with my coworkers and it's a great place for groups! You have tons of options to choose from to have grilled for you. Shrimp, chicken, beef, tofu, you name it - they can grill it. It's all you can eat so you can get whatever and however much you want. The grill time is pretty quick because it's such a big one and chefs seemed pretty experienced.   There was also a desert section! Probably my favourite part of it was the chocolate fountain!! You can take any of deserts and dip it under there. Amazing.   Overall, pretty good food especially if you're really hungry - it is all you can eat after all."}
{"text":"This place had great service, great selection, and it is all you can eat Meat and veggies! The price is standard for what you pay for at most all you can eat places. You select your meat and veggies and they also have a cooked buffet that contains chicken balls, shrimp, desserts, soups, and a variety of other delicious items.  When you are getting the Mongolian grill ingredients I recommend you avoid getting too much noodles otherwise you will be full quickly and perhaps not get your moneys worth. Stick to the meat and veggies and you will be fine...but the noodles are sooo good! Haha!"}
{"text":"Right away, I gravitated towards the giant grill.  The process was to fill your bowl with whatever noodles or rice, vegetables, toppings, meat, sauces, and anything else that you wanted to be grilled.  Once you were ready, you brought your bowl of toppings to the grill and you are given a number by the chefs.  Depending on if there are a lot of people in front of you or not, you wait for your turn for the chefs to take your bowl of raw ingredients and fire it up in front of you.  They pour some oil and then your chosen ingredients on it before dousing it with water and creating a spectacular fire display.  It was truly a feast for the eyes (and our phones/cameras).  When it was done cooking, the chef would return your bowl to you.  As I brought my finished bowl back to my seat to try it, I was impressed with how thoroughly cooked the noodles and chosen toppings were.  It was incredibly hot and grilled thoroughly too -- that fire grill is something else!  I thought that my noodle creation was delicious and I would have gone back for a second round right away if not for wanting to try out the rest of the buffet selections.  The mussels, steamed shrimps, and ribs were particularly delicious!  I chose a variety of items as well to try out their buffet selection.  All of their items were fully stocked and appeared very fresh.  At the end of the night, I made sure to make myself a custom bowl of Halo-halo.  They had a shaved ice machine where you could make your own shaved ice base for the Filipino dessert.  This was really cool and fun!  I added some ice cream, flavoured syrups onto my shaved ice, and some toppings.   I also tried the chocolate fountain (a favourite among many that night), cream puffs, and the Mocha Mousse Cake.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"A great place for big groups, those with kids and people who like noodles!  I personally always love Mongoli when I go and get so full, I am tapped out for a week but it is great value for the price.  There is 2 main buffet tables with stuff like rice, veggies, meats - your regular chinese buffet items.  I can always fill at least 2 full plates with variety so this is a plus (this is not Mandarin, please don't compare).  Then there is the MONGOLIAN BBQ part - starting with proteins, you get a choice of chicken, lamb, beef, shrimp, calamari, tofu - there is lots to choose from for everybody.  Then onto your Veggies, there was everything you can humanly thing of.  Then the sauces, I like the fact that you can custom make your own desired sauce and taste - there is tons to choose from and you can make it as saucy or as bland as you would like it!  Then the cool part - the grill masters toss your food back and forth on a big Mongolian bbq grill - then they swipe your food into a bowl - then bon appetite!  This is always great, I am a big noodle fan so this is great for me when I want a stackin' meal!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is quite expansive and very family friendly. We came here for lunch and it was $15.99 for the Chinese lunch buffet, including the stir-fry chef station. The buffet had a number of standard items, such as spring rolls, hot and sour soup, General Tso chicken, and much more. It also had a number of other unique items such as almond fish, and orange peel shrimp. We also visited the stir-fry station and had rice noodles with vegetables and chicken and beef. I'm not a fan of buffets, but everything was fresh and tasted quite good.   Service is excellent. The restaurant is clean and our server, Rosita was very friendly and eager. She even showed us how to make the halo halo ice shake dessert, which was quite refreshing."}
{"text":"Limited but enough variety. Bit pricey. They have a chocolate fountain. Desserts are good. The make ur own stir fried dish is very unique.  Drinks are pricey. Everything is very limited compared to mendarin.  But for a memorable and interactive dinner with special someone, I recommend this place."}
{"text":"It's a good place to take your family or a group of friends to as everyone can pick what they want. Prices are very reasonable.  The Mongolian Grill experience (where you pick your meat and other ingredients and have chef cook it in front of you) is interesting. Food quality is quite good, especially compared to other restaurants at 900 Don Mills. The servers were polite and attentive. Overall, I would recommend this buffet."}
{"text":"There's a reason why I was hesitant in coming to this restaurant in the first place. The reviews speak for itself. Overpriced buffet prices for subpar food. Let's start off with the cooked food, it lacked flavour and half the food was not fresh. For the main component of the restaurant, the Mongoilian Grill, it was cool that you can pick your own in ingredients and make your own custom stir fry but the sauces does not add enough flavour. Too many choices what do you put. The biggest let down was the price, $40 per person, way overpriced for the food that you are getting and the quality. I am not sure if i'd come back here."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile.  Much different than the one at pacific mall in Markham.   This site is more main stream, Markham serves more Asian tastes with shaved ice and different choices at the buffet portion.      The interior and service has gone downhill.   They don't seem as concerned about he quality or cleanliness as they used to.    More of a get you in and out quick and quantity of customers is more important.   Dirty table, no from a distance but sticky and not quite clean.   Lots if nicks and scratches on walls and tables.   Age of this place is showing.  Limited English with some service staff.  I was most surprised at the plastic fork and spoons at the desert table.   If you want metal you must ask for it."}
{"text":"All you can eat stir fry bar. Lots of meats, vegetables, noodles, and sauces. Cooked fresh to order.   If stir fry isn't your thing, they have the prepared food bar with standard Chinese fare.   Very good value for the money. Would go back again and again."}
{"text":"Really good concept! Great variety and price-quality is pretty good (for lunch, dinner is more expensive). We're glad that we found it. You have access to the mongolian grill and buffet which has lots of options. We're coming back for sure"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to check this place out and had a Friday off so went for lunch. I was greeted and seated quickly and offered a drink right away. I headed off to the grill area. I'm not sure why some people talk about being confused, it's easy to follow. Start with a bowl and add meat. Walk two steps and add veggies. Walk two steps and add noodles. Walk two steps and add sauce. This lands you in line to get it cooked. There are signs with directions and arrows in case you freeze up. I thought the selection was great. The only disappointment in the grill line was the ready-prepared sauces. If you follow the instructions of one ladle they are way too weak. Thankfully you can add more or go to the custom sauce station and fortify them. I tried both the Korean and Indonesian. Both needed some extra oomph (luckily there are soy and hot sauce packets on the buffet).   The buffet and salad bar is three rows of mostly Chinese-ish food with the mandatory french fries and caesar salad for the fussy children. The General Tao was mighty tasty. I also loved the chicken balls. They were trashy... real trashy... like the kind that look nothing like actual chicken. They were obviously made out of some kind of chicken paste. But they were delicious little sodium bombs. Use the buffet for sides and snacking between grill rounds. It's good but not the star attraction.   I was debating on a three star rating until dessert. Halo Halo bar? Yes please. Shaved ice, flavored syrups, evaporated milk, tapioca and taro, red beans, jelly, ice cream... oh yes. The chocolate fountain is a nice novelty. The tarts and squares are the same brought in garbage every other buffet uses. Annoyingly the cream puffs were freezer burned.   I ate like a monster and the bill including tax was $13. I'll definitely go back. It's not fine dining but I love AYCE and I love the mad-scientist creative aspect of the grill and halo halo stations. Don't know that I'd be willing to pay the weekend dinner price for the experience, though."}
{"text":"This place is ok, provides lots of food and decent value for lunch.  It's popular with the business crowd in that area throughout the week, though never really too busy not to get a seat.  The Mongolian grill section is decent, though you really need to be selective in terms of what sauces and liquids to use.  It's sort of a game of Russian roulette.  I enjoy the lamb, and I do recognize that all the meats are frozen (what are you gonna do for a $12 lunch?).  The traditional buffet table is small, but is more of a side-show compared with the grill.  There's a few quasi-dim sum items there, which is a nice touch.  Overall, not bad for a lunch spot or business lunch, but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit it either."}
{"text":"Went here a couple of times  Pricey for what you are paying for   There is only so much all you can eat stir fry one can eat  Good selection of fresh food for the stirfry you are creating  I think this place is more for the experience  Getting to watch a teppan chef cook your food is essentially what you are paying for  Nothing special but would go again"}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday evening for a birthday. Made a reservation beforehand for a group of four. Staff were friendly and attentive. My empty plate didn't stay on the table longer than 5 minutes. Great salad bar with smoked salmon and cocktail shrimp. Large Dessert variety! Let the staff know it's your birthday and they will give you a slice of cake while music plays in the background. Overall, great experience at decent price."}
{"text":"Really good food. Fresh meat you get to make your plate and theyll cook it for you in less than a minute. I must say the server Carmen was very outgoing and def made our night better!"}
{"text":"I like the fact even it is buffet, the food is so fresh. The \"create your own dish\" with teriyaki cooking, it was so much fun.  Red bean topping for the ice cream is perfect. Chocolate dressing for fruit is also fun for kids."}
{"text":"Average. Typical buffet place. I over ate fried greasy food. The Mongolian grill is hit or miss I'm not a big fan of making your own meals as usually I get the flavors wrong. I go out to eat so someone else can cook me a good meal. Dessert subpar-only good thing was chocolate fountain and fresh fruit. Cakes and other desserts a disappointment for dessert junkie like myself   Service was good. Prompt and friendly. Clean dining area and bathroom"}
{"text":"The food is not what I expected. Not even saw a lamb skewer or grilled lamb rib which should be traditional Mongolian food. Instead, there are more Cantonese style food like dim sum and soup.  There is a huge cooking area where 3 cooks stand and stir fried all the food you pick from the food tray. The problem is you need to season it by yourself. They don't care about the flavor as it's your call for any sauce, salt etc. The dim sum also taste plain. I guess the only thing we enjoy is glass of water.  I would give 2 stars because it has an OK service and nice environment of the restaurant. This is a one-time going place. Not really worth the money."}
{"text":"This buffet is a bit short of a typical big Chinese buffet. It features a Mongolian Grill, which is a large flat cooking area. You select the ingredients you want to use, and they are cooked while you wait.  The selection offered is that not extensive, and I guess that they have reduced it to accommodate the 'mongolian' part of the operation.  Its is just plain and undistinguished, not at all to the standard of Buffet Mandarin or Buffet King. If you are looking for a Chinese buffet there are better choices.  We tried this location, because we had previously eaten at a North End location. The food had been awesome and the selection fantastic. This was probably due to the fact they were shooting a commercial for the establishment that night. They must have really 'layed it on'.  Or to be totally fair if this is a franchise operation???...there is no consistency."}
{"text":"Warning, this review might be a bit bias, I have a soft spot for mongolian BBQ as my parents owned a Mongolian BBQ restaurant growing up and I went here with my childhood bff who spent many meals w me at my parents place.   I think I must of had 4 or 5 helpings! It's all you can eat which i usually hate but this time i totally pigged out! I didn't bother w the other buffet item except the sesame pastry, a classic w Mongolian BBQ.   The funny thing about Mongolian BBQ is if u don't like it, you got no one to blame but yourself! You pick your own ingredients, make your own sauces, and they cook it on a big grill.   They have a great selection of vegetables, meat, tofu and condiments. I particularly like the tofu because they freeze it first which is the traditional way to serve tofu for hot pot because it absorbs more sauce and has a great texture.  They do have a variety of pre made sauces so you don't have to do it all yourself. And if u don't like it you can just try again.  The location is clean, and well ventilated so your not gonna be too smelly. Ok, you'll be a little smelly but it only makes you want to go back again. :)"}
{"text":"I'm quite surprised by all of the comments of \"great service.\" As someone who's worked in the service industry, I'm especially sensitive and understanding to people in that position. Yes, the guys at the grill station are fantastic--very efficient while never undercooking the meat--and the servers are on their game with clearing the tables.   But my family tends to eat lunch a bit late, so we generally end up at the Mongolian Grill around or just before 2:00pm, and the place closes at 3:30 to get ready for dinner. You'd think that would give us a good hour and a half to sit down and relax and enjoy our meals and each other's company, but at 2:45, the waitstaff are already hounding us: \"Last call is at 3:15.\" Not just one server, but several of them. Even though we have plenty of time left to enjoy our food without being rushed. At 3:00, while we're still eating, one of the servers comes over, interrupts the conversation and says the restaurant is closing soon, so would we like separate bills or just one?   I sound petty, I know. And I understand this, in a sense. But when I was a server, I would quietly slip the bill and indicate that whenever they're ready to pay, I'm available. You never, ever want to make a patron feel rushed. We KNEW they were closing; we weren't just going to sit there after closing.  At 3:10, the server returns with a credit-card machine while my dad literally has a spoonful of dessert to his mouth. Clearly irritated, he politely comments that he was in the middle of his dessert and therefore not quite ready to pay, the server goes off about how they need to close out the cash by 3:30.  Like I say, I don't want to sound petty--and truly, I rarely whine about poor customer service--but unless you've got a table that's just sitting there after eating, looking like they have no intention of moving, and you're about to close, you cannot just rush them out. CERTAINLY not in the middle of eating. If you say you're open until 3:30, we get to stay until 3:30. If they want the cash closed out by then, they should change their sign to say they close at 3:00.   This has happened pretty much every time I've dined here. I enjoyed the food enough to keep going back a few more times and give this place 2 stars, but that kind of service is no longer worth it for me. I would have spoken to the manager, but I actually overheard another couple requesting a server to speak with the manager about something else, and the server refused, saying she was speaking on behalf of the manager. Don't know what kind of operation they're running here."}
{"text":"Food is good. A lot of choices, vegetables and meat are fresh. Always have people clean the sauce area which is really nice. If you don't know how to use those seasonings, the waiter will help you. Lunch price is a very good deal. A  clean and comfortable place to go to."}
{"text":"Good memories  Want to try it again but haven't had the opportunity to go to Toronto in a while"}
{"text":"Came here last night with some work folks and I had a blast.  i've been to the other Mongolian gRILL UP IN Markham by Pacific Mall. The food was great and selection of sauces, and additives to whatever meat you were having was enough.  The service is great! However would have preferred to have more selection of desserts...the place and atmosphere is comforting....plus you fet to watch the chef cooking in action with those gigantic looking chopsticks haha Definitely a place to come back to...."}
{"text":"There is a good selection of food at this place. The big draw is that you can customize your bowl and someone cooks it right in front of you. The service was great!!  My glass never was empty someone always came by to make sure I had water."}
{"text":"It has been a couple years since I was last there, but this place is just so memorable that I wanted to write a review for it.  First of all, the ambience is great!  I think it really made the experience, on top of the yummy food.  The make-your-own stir fry is unparalled compared to all the other restaurants I've been to.  You can put as many different ingredients as your want into a bowl, and then the chef will cook it on top of this huge circular iron stove top!    Very cool place."}
{"text":"Great stir fry nodles with good selection. And great buffet. I like it and every time im in Toronto i will visit for sure"}
{"text":"This place is great, fresh noodles, fresh dim sum, fresh everything!!!  Salads and gorgous deserts, i enjoyed this place tremendously.    Went for lunch, was busy but never really waited on anything, not food or drinks."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars.  I always find it a bit difficult to rate places where you are in control of how your food tastes...I mean if it tastes awful it is hardly the restaurant's fault since you put the ingredients together.  Overall this is an interesting place to go just to try once.  They have a buffet style section for some small foods (apps, salads, desserts), think Mandarin kinda deal.  At the back they have a selection of meats, veggies, aromatics, sauces, spices, noodles etc.  You pile up your bowl and then give it to the person at the grill and they will cook it for you right there.  Depending on who you get you might end up with a little show.  They \"cook\" with these long sticks that move the food around on the grill.  I made a rookie mistake of piling on the sauce...so much so that my oodles were literally drowning in it...so it made my meal not as tasty as I had hoped.  The restaurant is fairly large so it is good for big groups.  The service was ok...it looked like they hired a lot of new people (they had Trainee badges on) and were always accompanied by a trained staff (I have never seen that before so it shows the restaurant wants to make sure the service is good).  The servers were all polite...but a little slow.  It did take awhile to get our drinks (water and an iced tea) tour table.  I might be back if I have out of town visitors and want to take them to a different kinda place since it is close to my house...but I don't think I will rush back."}
{"text":"I used to love the Mongolian Grill back when it wasn't a franchise (and the only location was the one beside Pacific Mall) but things have definitely changed for the worse!   If you're not familiar with this place, their main selling point is that you create your own dish. You walk around with a bowl, place in some meat, vegetables, sauces, garnishes, etc and pass it to a chef who takes your bowl and cooks it all on a HUGE table stove in front of you in a minute and passes it right back to you. Annndd that's where the good things end and the ranting begins.  First off... $22 Dinner on weekends!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS? Seems like they're trying to take over some of Mandarin's business but dear lord with $22 I was expecting so much more. Their own \"make your own\" dish is still the same which is good but the food at the buffet was old and stale and almost inedible. Coming for lunch on weekdays wouldn't be bad as it's around $9-10 but I definitely would not pay more than that for what you're getting here.  My second biggest disappointment was that this location doesn't have that ice shaver with all the sweet toppings as the P-Mall location does!! (I know this one doesn't really count but I used to come here just for that haha).  Third, big mistake on my sisters part but she ordered a coffee to have with some of the buffet dessert and it was honestly so bad she spat it all over the table with her first sip. With a complaint to our server, it took two trips to the manager for him to \"offer\" to remove the coffee from our bill!   Argh, just disappointed in Mongolian and probably never going back."}
{"text":"The very notion of a DIY buffet is means enough to try this place out. A wide variety of food to choose, cooked and uncooked, with many sauces to select. The place is great for kids, who were fascinated by the unique grill."}
{"text":"Love the \"choose your ingredients and we cook it fresh for you\" side of this place.  You pile it high in a bowl, from a choice of meats to a great variety of veggies, add sauce and/or seasonings and hand it over.  The cooks place the food on a searing hot drum and manipulate the food with long sticks.    It's a bit of a show and has very tasty results.  It works for Vegetarians and meat fans.  Plus, lamb is one of the meat selections, which I love.    Note:  I've also seen them clean down the drum for someone who requested it due to allergies.  Extra points for doing this as it took them some time.  There's also a Chinese style buffet with familiar dishes, fresh fruit, jello, dim sum, dessert squares, a chocolate fountain and ice cream."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've had Mongolian BBQ. As one reviewer points out, Mongolian BBQ is woefully inaccurate but when you can get someone to grill up bowls and bowls of shaved lamb before your eyes, they can call it Karl Wears Panties for all I care.  Unlike most buffets were it's quantity over quality, Genghis Khan gets the quality just about right. In addition to the noodle buffet, they have some chinese favorites (dim sum weekend mornings) on the side tables. The dessert table's chocolate fountain is pretty fun. Ladle some of that on your ice cream and it forms a nice hard shell.   Service is great and prices are cheaper than Mandarin."}
{"text":"GREAT price,   the food is good quality and very tasty.  Staff was very helpful.  I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"I need to start listening to my brain when it tells me to not go to all you can eat buffets. I tried this time, but the lure of delicious looking food was too much and I was seduced by her siren song. I was off to eat all I could   I heard of this place from a post off of Facebook, and knew that there was a possibility it wouldn't be quite as good as it looked on the ad. I was right.  Don't get me wrong, it's fairly good. The giant wok they have which seems to be the star attraction in their advertising was what I expected. I'd suggest a small recipe board to show what combinations newcomers might try, but the chance is you'll still have a good bowl of noodles no matter what. Rice noodles and beef was a winner for me.  The northern Chinese buffet is good, but I found most items were not incredibly flavorful. The wings were decent and the overall presentation was cleaner than many other buffets, but again, food was just average for at best.  Once I had eaten enough grease, I hit up the desert row and it was....also not great. The first item I picked up was a brownie....which fell apart in my hand. The second was coffee cake, which was actually quite good. The last was the chocolate fondue, which was also pretty good. I went for the strawberries and marshmallows. I ended up dunking it in my water, which was a good trick to solidify the chocolate.  The AYCE comes in at a bit under $30.00. It isn't entirely unreasonable and even though I found the food to be just so-so, I'd go again, just with a bit more know how, now (And more time on the clock)  Worth the trip if you're in a group"}
{"text":"When I came into the restaurant, I I had a feeling that this restaurant was going to be great but I was proved wrong. This is a traditional Mongolian Grill restaurant. To start off, the food taste fresh but not many choices of raw items to choose from. I hope they add more ingredients because I was disappointed with it. During my dinner, I went up to get more food when I saw a dead fly in the vegetables. The servers quickly replaced the vegetables and assured us that everything was safe to eat. However, I lost my appetite from the dead fly. Also, the servers are friendly and very quick to respond to your order. The restaurant decor feels comfortable and nice to eat in. The chairs are comfy and very spacious. I gave this restaurant a 3 because the menu and buffet does not have much variety in it and really disappointed me. The fly really ruined my appetite. However, I recommend this to people who enjoy Mongolian Grills."}
{"text":"I'm almost certain that Genghis Khan did not conquer much of Central Asia and China by feeding his subjects a dizzying choose-your-own-adventure of meats, veggies, sauces and condiment sauces to be grilled on a giant stone lifesaver.    I've come to expect the same from buffets no matter the cultural twists.  Generally you're talking about a long line of steam trays, sneeze guards and deep fried foods.   As Marie F. puts it, we're talking about the \"quantity not quality approach\".  The novelty with the Mongolian Grill is that you are presented with a wide variety of raw meats (beef, pork, chicken, and lamb) and vegetables, some seafoods (shrimps, fake crab and squid rings), noodles (egg, rice, udon, etc.) and a stupefying selection of soupy sauces (spicy, curry, honey garlic ... more than 10 in total) and condiment sauces (ginger, garlic, oyster ... more than 20 in total).  The idea here is that once you've cobbled together what you think would be a tantalizing concoction of ingredients you hand over the cooking duties to the men at the grill.  The grill is a large round stone cooking surface where the \"chefs\" use to prepare your carefully chosen delectables.  You stand along a bar and watch as the magic happens.  Sounds very exotic and fun doesn't it?  The problems begin about 10 steps before you get to the grill.  You really have no idea what's going to make a good dish.  I'm not a good cook so I threw together a bunch of ingredients that by themselves looked pretty good but quite possibly a potential disaster here.  When it comes to the sauces a loud mouthed hostess lady was happy to scoop all kinds of liquids into my overflowing bowl of mounding food.  She was even kind enough to carry it over to the grill and hand it to the chef.   Once at the grill itself the chef first scrapes off the caked on charcoal of past delicacies from your designated grill area.  In the centre of the grill goes the blackened sludge (more on this later) down a hole to god-knows-where.  Then the chef throws your bowl of assorted num-nums onto the grill and proceeds to move it around with what looks like a very large wooden chopstick.  He shuffles it around and flips it every which way and eventually slides it into a larger bowl with a deft hand, only losing maybe 10-15% of it off the side of the grill.    Ok if you haven't guessed yet I've found a few problems with the formula here and I'll dispense my opinions now.  How am I supposed to know what goes into making a good Mongolian dish?  I'm no cook, why should I have to make this kind of decision?  In fact, the very reason I chose not to stay home to eat is because I am either unable or unwilling make the critical decision of what to cook at this time.  Isn't the reason you go to a restaurant is to eat food that is based off a recipe you don't know and have it prepared for you?    Assuming you get past this, the bowls they provide are way too small.  You end up having your selections falling off the side and then get your hands all dirty pouring the sauces on.  Clearly they know this a problem because they have ample napkins around the grill area to wipe your invariably filthy hands.  Also notice that the bowl they slide the food into after it's cooked is much larger than the one you brought over.  Coincidence?   However the real deal-breaker here is that once you get back to your table and chow-down on your cleverly devised dish, you'll notice that there's an alarming amount of blackened crud mixed in (remember that sludge?).  It makes everything taste like ashes.  Kind of like barbecuing at home without thoroughly cleaning off your grill.    Finally the \"chefs\" appear to be a surly lot.  They speak Cantonese and when I was there I noticed that they were cursing at each other a lot.  Just so you know, in Cantonese \"di-you\" is basically the F-word.  Maybe I'm being harsh as there's not much culinary talent that goes into dumping a load of ingredients on the grill and cooking it to death.   To cap off this review the other buffet items that don't get grilled on the giant stone life-saver are only OK at best.  Deep fried chicken wings, soggy stir-fries, appalling dim-sum dumplings (they are truly heinous), and the usual variety of \"asian\" buffet foods that you'd normally find at a Mandarin just with less selection.  The dessert table fairs the same with a selection of fresh fruits (most of which were decently fresh like the strawberries) and little snack cakes (not great) and ice cream.  There's also a chocolate fountain that is very appealing to young and old alike.  To top it all off the price of $20+ for an adult plus drink and tip is not very compelling.  Do yourself a favor and go to Choco Korean BBQ in Markham if you want to grill your own meats and eat all you can for about the same price.  I think Genghis would mourn over his name being associated with this poor establishment.  2 stars for good strawberries."}
{"text":"Well, there are a lot more good things to say about this restaurant than bad. That's for sure.  The food was excellent. Service was great and the staff was quite friendly and on the ball. Though it wasn't really that busy so it's hard to tell how the staff works under pressures. Nonetheless, they were really great.  The dinning experience is quite unique. Watching the chef cook your food in front of your eyes. The only cons I'd have to say would be that there should be more variety of buffet food. Prepare the shrimp so the customer doesn't have to remove the skin themselves. And some food could have been changed from the buffet so it's fresh. Cream puffs were stale and hard as a rock. And I think one of the most important things to point out is that it would take a bit of time to \"perfect\" the dish you want. It would take multiple visits to try all the different combinations to get the taste that's best for you. But overall. 4/5 and a definite must go if you're looking for a cool,fun,and unique dining experience with great food."}
{"text":"Child friendly staff (placed a step stool for a child to see over the counter to watch the chefs cook the noodles). The staff would even ask if it was your first time doing the custom noodles to help out.   The food was okay. Deep fried food, aside from the chicken wings, were too dry and hard. Ribs were flavorful and tender.  Note: for vegetarian noodles the chef would advise you to hand over the pre-cooked noodles and ingredients to the waitress/staff if you do not want it on the same cooking surface that the meat were on."}
{"text":"Sister restaurant to the Great Khan in Markham (see my review of that as menu and offerings are similar).  We liked this one more as it is a bit less barnlike and the service was nicer.  Food seemed just a tad better as well."}
{"text":"I really dig this place when I'm in the mood to stuff my face with various types of protein.   It's fun to mix up your own stir fry, sure it's a novelty but who cares? Let your imagination run wild.  The small buffet setup they have is surprisingly decent, though obviously not the main attraction. I was disappointed the last time I went and they didn't have the pork belly slices.   Pro Tip: the water they use to help the stir-fry cook really dilutes the taste so don't be afraid to go heavy on the sauces and seasonings."}
{"text":"This review is based on my hubby's numerous experiences dining here.  His company is located just up the street so their team lunches often take place at this restaurant.  And let me tell you, every time, I mean, EVERY TIME he eats there (more specifically, the actual grill part), he gets the worst case of gurgly butt which is rather troublesome.    He has since opted to stick to buffet area only and has been problem free since."}
{"text":"This place has a great build your own stirfry section, from the meats, to the veggies, to the sauce and spices, everything! And the buffet adds a lot of variety. Was offered free bubble tea as part of a promotion as well!"}
{"text":"One of the better choices for Asian AYCE buffets.I really like the option to create your own stir fry which is what makes the place unique. Pick your meat(pork,lamb,beef,chicken or several different kinds of seafood),veggies(plenty of options),noodles(3 varieties) and sauce(large selection of pre-mixed or create your own) and hand your bowl to the cook who has it ready for you in a minute or so after tossing it around on a huge hot plate with no oil,just water.   They also have the standard pre-cooked appetizers-spring rolls,dumplings,some salads, deep fried stuff,etc-nothing special.  Desserts are limited but the chocolate fountain with fruits and marshmallows is cool."}
{"text":"Quick note: Mongolian BBQ is neither Mongolian nor BBQ.  It is, however, awesome.    Genghis Khan plays both sides of the street, offering a traditional Canchinese buffet as well as the Mongolian BBQ.  You pile meat and veggies in a bowl, ladle them with sauce ingredients, and awaaaaayyy you go.    The food gets cooked on a large flat surface (like a wok, only not round), but it definitely ain't  BBQ esque.  Or even that much like a grill.   But, seriously, it's all you can eat.  That is as good as you let it be.  I've gone to my limits and beyond at another Mongolian BBQ, and you don't want to do it."}
{"text":"The gimmick is the grill, included in the price of the buffet. You take a bowl and load it up with protein, veggies, rice or noodles, and a ladle of sauce, and then you give it to the chef who stir-fries it on a huge flat teppan-table thing. Meat-eaters have said the grill is great; the tofu,  however, has been frozen and is tasteless and spongy. The sauces are meh and the noodles are soggy. I've been here twice and tried the grill both times, and this was my experience both times. I think I'll avoid the grill and just stick to the awesome buffet.  It's a huuuuuuge Chinese-Canadian fusion buffet with really tasty food -- everything from North American staples like chicken balls and chow mein to more authentic steamed scallion buns and dumplings. The desserts are what you expect from a Chinese buffet -- a few meh egg tarts and sesame balls, plus lots of napoleons and cream puffs and fruit and flan. Good for filling in the cracks.  (Oh yeah, the flan. Really really tasty. Hilarious if you forget to pick up a spoon and try eating it with your chopsticks.)  The place is huge and high-ceilinged and when it's full it gets loud. We were there at 5 on a Wednesday, and just after we got our table a bus pulled up and the place was jammed.   I wish I could do half-stars, because I would like to give it more than a three because the food is just plain tasty. The parts of the food that are not tasty are what take points off. It's not all consistent, but you'll find your faves on the buffet and keep going back for more.  Incidentally you can book the place for large groups. I attended a club awards banquet there a couple of years back. They did a great job for us."}
{"text":"Love it.. it's definitely different than other buffet.. like how you can mix things and make them cook it... amazing pinacolada. Would I go again? Sure..  Nice for dating.. a bit expensive for a buffet... Great Job!!"}
{"text":"Went to the Mongolian grill last night. I have heard rave reviews about it and it has been on my to-do list for a while. My findings were as follows: Decor- Everything looks modern and clean. Found it a bit funny that the sign to the men's room says \"man\" but coming from a family of immigrants I can understand. Facilities were clean. Food-The food was awful. My tummy is still hurting as i think I ate bad meat on the do it yourself part of the buffet. (I think it was the lamb). The ribs were actually very good., The mini bbq buns were good as well, but that's where it ended. Everything else was mediocre low grade food.  Dessert on the other hand was great. Not only do they have a chocolate fountain, but it was with hardening chocolate dip sauce. If i wasn't diabetic, I would of had my money's worth there. If this is where the problems ended, it would have received a 3 star rating from me. My cousin who has visited there a few times said this was the worst the food had ever tasted and I would have repeated. Service- The absolute worst service i have ever received in my life from every angle. On the fix it yourself station, there was only one person working there and he was cooking our meals one at a time (there was 4 of us). I found it very annoying that I had to wait for everyone food to be prepared separately (it's a big grill, cook 2 meals at a time or more, its already prepared for the chef all he has to do is stir it and dump it onto a plate. (it takes 2 minutes on average per plate so as the 5th in line (someone was ahead of us) it was a good 10 minutes before he got to me).  There were 4 tables in there that night, and 6 waitresses and a few busboys etc. Instead of waiting on us, they were setting up tables and talking among themselves. After 15 minutes of not having a drink, I had to call someone over who finally took our drink order (I didn't even have water ffs).  When we would get up to get the next plate, the dishes would be left on our table. About the time when we were getting dessert, (and I'm not one to normally cause a scene) I had to call (more like below) out to someone to ask if anyone works there. Obviously no apologies, he gave me a dirty look and picked up our dishes almost dropping them on us.  Last laugh- Bill came out to 95.89 or so (for 4 people 3 had pop) including taxes (not worth it by the way). This is when the waitress actually started paying attention to our table. She came by more in between the time she dropped the bill to the time we left than she had the whole night.  I normally leave 20-25% tip for a job well done, 15-20% for a good job. I strongly feel that if people didn't tip out of obligation then waiting staff would get the message and improve. We were so pissed, we left them $96 on a $95.89 bill and left with the waitresses eyes glaring at us in disbelief. Repeat? I think not."}
{"text":"A terrific place that is able to handle large crowds. Food is always fresh and you get to experiment with different selections to get just the taste you want. A secondary buffet offers up decent options"}
{"text":"Went there with a few coworkers. It is a large place and had no problem getting a table. It was the first time for my coworkers and the waitress explained how it works. In the create your own bowl section there is a lot of ingredients to choose from. One of the staff was helpful in explaining the sauces, depending on what flavour we wanted.  Don't be afraid to fill up your bowl with ingredients since it will take up less space after cooking. I was impressed to see how they cook everything on the round grill, and really impressed how the put everything in the bowl with a move of the hand.  There is also a small section in the restaurant with traditional buffet food. There is a small section for desert, but what is different is the shaved ice station and the chocolate fountain. It was a bit expensive (30$ just water to drink) but it was fun and will probably go back."}
{"text":"This place is really good...I like how you can make your own dish and have the chef cook your dish....The buffet is good too if you don't trust yourself...This is a great place to take a date."}
{"text":"Came at 8:55 and they told me I cannot be seated becuase they close at 9:30. The guy at the door was very rude about it"}
{"text":"Service was great. I made reservations online and got a reply within 24 hrs. The staff were also very efficient when we were there. Cleared our used plates immediately, asked for drinks, seated asap, etc. I only had an issue w/ the person who took a photo of my dad with his slice of cake for his bday. It's nice they provide a free slice of chocolate cake for anyone having a birthday with a sparkler as well as taking a photograph. They ask for your email info & the pic would be sent a few days later. Unfortunately, my dad's birthday photo was BLURRY! My suggestion to the staff who took the photo, if you aren't sure whether it was a good quality photo, DO IT AGAIN. It's just ONE EXTRA SHOT. It might be a milestone birthday you know?! Thankfully everyone else at the table took it on their devices so we had a copy. Next time I'm checking their damn camera myself or bringing my own camera.   Foodwise, it was as expected. From the buffet station, I did like the schezwan beans a lot, broccoli salad, etc. Skip the desserts. They didn't look appetizing. I did like the chocolate fountain (although clearly 'watered down'), but if a child put their finger in it you honestly wouldn't know....For the bbq, same stuff as usual. It's nice there are lots of sauces to pick from.  Plenty of parking and easy to find. Good for large groups. Seniors get 20% off."}
{"text":"Vomit."}
{"text":"As a buffet place, I didn't really expect much of the food here, but I was pleasantly surprised. I thought all the items I tried were solid - it's prepared well, not overcooked and the flavour was decent. I especially like the mussels, which are green lipped New Zealand mussels that are known to be good quality and meaty.   The thing to go for here is definitely the raw section where you place raw items that you like in a bowl and hand it over to the chefs at the circular grill table. Not only do you get a hot piping bowl of stir fry, you also get a side of fire show as entertainment...neat!   I was told to add at least a ladle of sauce to the bowl so that food would not be dry after the cooking process, and that worked out really well. I had two very satisfying bowls of lamb and beef stir-fry here.  The food at buffets are not meant to blow your mind, and is much the case here. But to put everything in perspective, even on a \"pricey\" weekend night, it is still under $30 a person. Great deals can be had if you come in for a weekday lunch or dinner. Compare this with \"asian citrus fruit\" buffet which can cost up to $32 a person. So in my book this place provides very good value compared to your typical buffet and a 4-star establishment for me."}
{"text":"I went there for dinner yesterday with my hubby.  Food is ok.  Near to the end of our meal, the waitress came over and ask if I have a voucher (We didn't ask for a bill).  I did and gave it to her.  According to the bill after tax is around $50 something and with my voucher, the balance is about $11.xx.  My hubby gave a $20 bill and as there's not much service, so I'm thinking whether to give 10% or 15% tips.  No matter what I assume we should get the change, but after waiting for over 15 mins (since we're still having dessert)  nothing shows up.  I think that pretty unappropiate not giving your customer the bill and even change, right?  So wanna warn all of u planning to go there, pay by credit card!!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It's pretty big.  I like the fresh factor of the type of food thats there.   They have a small buffett area too but nothing here to really talk about (Except the macaroons) The only thing I can say though, is that you really have to like noodles to come here.  If you like teriyaki and places like that, its basicallly like Fresh neverending Teriyaki. For me, that gets redundant, but for you it might not!"}
{"text":"Great food selection, great service. Ate here for the first time today and I recommend this place. You can make your own noodles and put any ingredients you want. They have an amazing selection from meat to vegetables to sauces.  I love seeing how my food is being cooked. My glass of iced tea was refilled consistently. Love this ppace!"}
{"text":"DIY stir fry, dim sum, buffet food, cold bar, and dessert with a chocolate fondue! The DIY stir fry section has a great variety of fresh meats, vegetables, and sauces. Plenty of desserts to go around as well - shaved ice with a number flavoured syrups, six selections of ice cream (no Green Tea or Red Bean though), pastries, and a chocolate fondue with strawberries, mangos, and marshmellows.  The place is clean and modern with attentive waitresses who are always quick to clear finished plates and refill our drinks.  The only issue I have with this place is that their bowls are way too small..."}
{"text":"I went with two friends for dinner the other night. It was amazing, We went right as it opened at 5pm so there was only us and another family for awhile which was nice. The wait staff was very attentive and offered us refills as soon as our glass neared empty. The place was very clean. The wait staff had no problem offering utensils for us as the chopsticks were already on the table when we sat down,  The food was...spectacular!! I started off with the grill part and the food was so fresh and there was so many options. I filled two bowls for one meal which came out to one bowl at the end, The guy working the grill was friendly and fast,  The buffet was great, lots of options, I loved the shau mai (which I know I didn't spell correctly) and the lotus seed bun as well as the fried goyza (again another spelling mistake ;) )  The dessert was nearly the best part of the entire meal, there was a lot of options and the slush machine and chocolate fountain had to be my favriote. I loved using cherry syurp and condensed milk in my slush! Yum! Something you have to experience is the little green balls, I cant remember what their called but they explode in your mouth with juice when you bite down, I had no idea and was in for a shock and a treat,   The price is a bit steep but there's so many options that it's a great dinner idea! I will definatly be back!"}
{"text":"I've been to this place several times and the allure of DIY stir-fry and the big round cooktop always keeps me coming back.   Out of most of the asian buffets in Toronto, Genghis Khan Mongolian Grill makes less of a dent in your wallet as opposed to the Mandarin for instance. To be fair, Mandarin has a bit more variety, but you're offsetting quantity with food cooked right before your eyes.  Don't expect too much from the already-cooked section. The taste is just alright, but there's a lot less to choose from. Maybe 5-6 items in the steamed section, and another 10 cooked items. There's a small salad section too, but honestly why would you go to a buffet for salad?  They also have a chocolate fountain set just a little bit away from the rest of the food. It's alright. There's always going to be at least one kid struggling to dip their strawberry or marshmallow in it. I question the cleanliness of the chocolate because of said kid though... haha...  Good stir-fry, good service. Good enough for me."}
{"text":"From the moment we walked, we felt like we were enjoying something special. Our hostess greeted us with a huge smile and was very helpful answering our questions since this was our first time. She even seated us near the buffet since we had two little ones (5 and 2). The grill pit was an absolute delight to watch and the kids got to watch as well since there were some very convenient stepping stools on which to prop them up.   The food was AMAZING!!! Even our picky eaters found plenty to satisfy their choosy pallet. I recommend starting with the Mongolian Bar-B-Q where you can choose from a variety of foods (4 kinds of meats, some seafood, vegetables, mushrooms, and a myriad of other toppings. You put it all in a bowl, choose any combination of about a dozen sauces and various oils and then hand your creative creation to one of the pit chefs who masterfully spreads it all across a giant flame heated o-ring. The process takes about a minute.  The dessert bar was the least impressive of the selection, but quite good nonetheless. I must say that the kids loved the finger like desserts they could eat with their hands. The best feature was the shaved flavored ice. And I have to admit that their custard caramel drizzled flan was tasty.  We were passing through and happened to arrive on a Saturday so the price was close to 15$ per Adult and about 8$ per Child with our youngest one costing 2$ if I remember correctly.  The interior decorating was cozy and upscale from other family buffets I have seen. Everything was clean and well maintained. Employees frequently wiped spills and kept things looking clean. Tables were solid (granite-like top) and chairs were made of rod iron and quite stable.  I would definitely recommend this place. Be prepared to come in hungry and to pay accordingly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I especially love the fact that I can create my stir fry the way I want it.  The buffet also has a great selection of food and the desserts are great as well.  I especially love the chocolate fountain."}
{"text":"If there is one thing I have had lots of in my life it's buffets; as a child, my parents had a quantity not quality approach to restaurants which resulted in lots of mediocre meals. Perhaps this is why I am choosing to be a little kinder to Genghis Khan... because as a buffet it's pretty good!   As previously mentioned mom and dad love buffets so I decided to treat them to lunch for father's day. At $13 a person (and $11 for my mom because she's a senior) I thought we got good value for a Buffet (I am in no way rating this compared to a conventional restaurant...)   To reiterate on the concept mentioned by my fellow yelpers the main focus of this buffet is the DIY dish. Pick your meats, veggies, noodles and sauces and watch while it all gets cooked on a huge flat grill while you wait (about 30 seconds).   It should be noted that there is only one cooking area so if you are a vegetarian and you are concerned about cross contamination with cooking areas this is NOT the place for you!   The second piece of this restaurant is a traditional buffet.  Although I wouldn't say the buffet part is terrible I definitely think it's forgettable and as Lan pointed out the dinner price points are a rip off (at $22 a person) especially when you consider that it's the same food!   In any case my meal was good and I liked the do it yourself options."}
{"text":"I like their DIY crushed ice. I sometimes made iced red bean w Vanilla Ice Cream. Also love their DIY noodles, sweet coconut custard dumplings, deep fried chicken wings and okra from their salad bar.  All were fresh and tasty.  Weekend lunch ayce $23"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant for a Special occasion and what a disappointment it was. The Mongolian grill although has  decent amount of options but they pour loads of water on the grill. Also in my case I had to throw my entire bowl coz just before grilling my bowl they cleaned the grill and they didn't bother to clean it well and my bowl had all black burnt stuff from grill.  The other items in buffet are the regular Chinese buffet stuff. Some of it tasted so stale. The brownies were especially bad. Rest of the desserts were equally pathetic. Only good thing was the chocolate fountain but they don't keep strawberry any longer which was bit disappointing."}
{"text":"I am always a bit skeptical about buffet for the quality of food. We went on a Sunday afternoon as I wanted to try a new restaurant but couldn't think of one. I was still hesitate after I arrived in that plaza until I walked inside the restaurant. It was a bit more spacious than other Chinese buffet, and the selection seemed decent. We arrived at 2pm, as the buffet ended at 3:30, there were still plenty of customers but not super crowded. It was nice that they refilled the food pretty often and even after 3pm they still refilled, so I felt I am not just eating the leftovers.   All the buffet items tasted decent and not overly oily or over seasoned. The BBQ ribs tasted surprisingly good. I'd prefer that over the ones at the rib festival or baton rogue. They also have the ice shredding machine and chocolate fountain, i can see why kids like coming here. I am not a huge fan of the customized stir fry bowl, the presentation is nice and it is interesting to try, but that's pretty much of it.   I did enjoy the experience, as for weekend lunch price of 20 dollars, it was fair. I probably wouldn't pay more than that for buffet. I wouldn't mind to comeback once a while when I am in the mood for buffet."}
{"text":"The wait-time today to get meat cooked on the grill was about 30 minutes so I decided to stick to the Chinese buffet. When the bill arrived, I noticed a 30% increase and when I inquired, I was told that \"it's holiday prices from mid-December until early January.\"  Most customers are regulars working in the area and considering it's an all you can eat, almost no one thinks to ask for the price when they come in. Bad move on the part of the management. That is not a good customer retention strategy.   I think I'm done with this place. I don't like to feel as though I'm being taken for a sucker, especially when it's a place I've been going to for lunch for the past 6-7 years."}
{"text":"Has become more expensive over the past few years, but still very good.  Lots of selection in the standard buffet- sanitation, unlike many other AYCE Asian places, is very good. Ostensibly 'Mongolian' grill is the real shtick here - essentially just a made-to-order noodle bar, but a very good one at that.  Desserts are quite varied; they include a shaved ice machine with a variety of toppings, and a chocolate fountain."}
