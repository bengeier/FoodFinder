{"text":"Have to say I decided to check this place out after remembering this place existed. Shawarma sandwich was moderately priced, fresh and tasty. Decent size as well. Liked that they toasted it so it got hard and crunchy. I frequent other spots for chicken on the rocks. Think I noticed they offer it here but for a much higher price. Will check back here to see the portion size."}
{"text":"The food is very flavorful and the staff is friendly.  If you are looking for an everyday run of the mill you will not find it here.  Prices are reasonable for what you get."}
{"text":"Safari has new owners. The new owners of have shared their love of food, traditional recipes and TLC to there restaurant. I ordered the Tuesday special  two falafel wraps for $6.99 - the new owner said he had not seen me there yet and gave me a single falafel to try while I waited. I spoke with his wife regarding their recipe and her enthusiasm to share this was heart warming. Took no more than 5 minutes to complete my order.  How I order my wraps:  Everything but lettuce, tomatoes or olives.   No extra garlic sauce.  Extra spicy.   I invite you to find a better wrap in the area."}
{"text":"This restaurant was one of the best. Food was amazing, hot and fresh. They come out as they are ready so you can start. Instead of having the dishes wait and get cold. A definite must try!!"}
{"text":"Pros- Big portions, excellent food, service, Cons- Variety, DÃ©cor  The restaurant is a little gem. Highly Recommended!  My family members each have different conception of value and differing tastes. Some like upscale restaurants, others a chain restaurant, while others want to try something new. Somehow we landed on Safari Grill and everybody was very pleased, enough so to repeat it multiple times.   Basically, Safari Grill is African/Indian Cuisine. Dishes consist of 1) meat/vegetables, 2) sauce (generally a curry type) and 3) carbohydrate (naan, rice, cassava). In my party of 9 we tried many things and everything was excellent.   The portions were quite large, enough so, that we were able to make 2.5 lunches from the leftovers.  Service was excellent. There were only 7 or so other occupied tables during our visits. Prices range from $13 to $25 with mains averaging around $17  The restaurant itself is on the smaller side and is decorated with a tacky zebra/safari theme. Much like the sun, don't stare directly at the zebra print, or you will suffer eye damage. Otherwise it is inviting and can multitask as a casual/ sophisticated/ romantic/ business dinner type of place.   If you are not a big fan of curry type of food, there are only a few things on the menu for you to eat. One family member had the chicken melt which was said to be good, but not great. All types of vegetable, goat, lamb curries were excellent along with the chicken skewers and cassava fries.   Be cognizant of the spiciness of dishes, 1 (out of 3) peppers was good enough for me.   There are other cheaper places for curries in the city, but I am happy with this place and will return."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE SUCKS ASS!!! what more can I say?  I was looking forward to a decent meal, but terribly disappointed. I wanna rate zero stars. These guys don't know how to grill chicken if they're lives depended on it! I ordered a chicken plate, they gave me 6 tiny pieces of chicken that tasted like moist cubes of wood, so dry and tasted like shit. The hummus tasted like it had gone bad, if I get food poisoned I'm gonna call food inspections on this place. I asked for lots of veggies, this guy was grabbing small portions making it look like he was grabbing a lot, spend 14$ on this shit unbelievable. i went to T&T and got a Vietnamese sandwich for 2$ since I tossed away 3/4 of the meal. This place used to be so good with the original owner. Save your money and go to Naders, this no joke!!!!"}
{"text":"Hi Guys, I saw all the reviews and sounded really amazing to me, so I went there to grab a shawarma combo.  Chicken was bland, no taste and potatoes were not cooked as well. Please don't waste your money. The place was not really clean."}
{"text":"When you walk in to Safari Grill there is no doubt where you are, zebra print on the walls and on the tables with splashed of red to confuse the senses. The night I went the place was packed!  Ordered the BBQ platter, halibut korma and okra curry. All seasoned medium/one chili.  Foodwise the curries were on point. Korma was delicious, creamy and you could taste the pistachios and cashews. I love okra but have a great fear of cooking/cleaning it. So when i saw it on the menu, I ordered it and it was fantastic, spicy..  Although, I question the one chili/medium system they have in place, the okra was really spicy but the BBQ was not.  Sadly the BBQ was not so good, dry and a bit cold I was thoroughly disappointed. The kebabs were like chewing on jerky, chicken was dry and if you don't eat the piri piri fries when they arrive, well, they're just soggy fries.   I'll come back for the curries and I'd try the beef ribs but there's no \"winner winner chicken dinner\" here..."}
{"text":"Had the chicken shawarma plate, many condiments, sauces and ample flavors for anyone to be fulfilled. Definitely recommend it; not much of a dine in place though."}
{"text":"Made my way out of downtown during a workday to come here for lunch one day and it was worth it. I ordered the $10 lunch special and it easily exceeded my expectations. The crispy, juicy Tandoori chicken drumstick that arrived on my platter was the best I have ever had. I will come back again with the family."}
{"text":"The food here is really flavourful and authentic. Service is good and friendly. Price is decent with good portion. Overall highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"As a regular weekday customer I was very disappointed today. (Sunday) I arrive at the shop which the interior lights turned off, and a one of the doors boarded up (I guess the glass had broken).  I asked if it was under new management but was told it wasn't, and that the owner and regular staff don't work Sundays.  The taste was okay, not so different from usual but;  -lights weren't on   -cashier was not trained (almost overcharged me without me having to tell him, made a wrap that ripped so he got another pita and double wrapped it)  -my order was totally forgotten about and 2 other orders before me were served and I had to remind the staff of my orders  -no fresh veggies stocked (pics attached)  -meat was dry and cold  -wrap wasn't toasted properly   Overall it was like being in a whole different restaurant..."}
{"text":"Their shawarma platters are excellent. The meat is juicy and the sauces are flavorful. The rice and garlic potatos are delicious. The service is always polite and attentive. There isn't much seating inside, about four or five tables for four each."}
{"text":"Like others, I have driven past this place several times and thought I would satisfy my beef shawarma craving by finally giving this place a try.  I dined in and ordered the beef shawarma plate with salad, rice and potatoes.  On the positive side, service was quite fast and indeed the potatoes were delicious.  If you like sauces, they are quite generous with your choice of hummus, garlic, hot sauce and tahini to your heart's delight.  The generous portion of rice was tasty too.  Unfortunately, my overall experience was mixed for the following reasons.  Although fairly generous, the beef shawarma was more like gyro meat in terms of texture and taste.  Therefore, I wouldn't say that it is authentic, traditional beef shawarma.  My salad portion was rather small and primarily iceberg lettuce.  One can get enough of a good thing as my plate was oversauced.  I would have rather had a bit more salad than the two pools of extra sauce on my plate.  Finally, service-wise, I did not receive a \"thank you\" at any point during the ordering or serving process.  As a brand new customer, this bugs me.  There are so many other dining options available in the area.  I would have given this establishment an additional star if I had been shown a bit of basic appreciation for my patronage.  Given other endorsements, I might go back and try their chicken shawarma.  If I don't a get a \"thank you\" then, it will be my last visit."}
{"text":"What can I say?  Terrific butter chicken, wonderful naan bread, and a really cool dessert ! The name of which  escapes my wee brain right now....  The atmosphere is pretty nice, lots of windows, but a little crowded. The servers were very attentive even though it was a busy time, we were checked on regularly.  Its a very nice change of taste as it is a fusion of north african and indian cusine.    I will certainly be back to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Safari's food has stayed consistent for months now. Whatever we order from here is delicious. Their portion sizes are generous and ingredients are fresh. Although the restaurant has a sit in area, most of their customers drop by for take out orders. For the uninitiated, their chicken shawarma platters are a safe bet, for the calorie conscious the Safari on Ice is a delicious healthy choice (the meat is laid on top of a bed of salad). Safari is our safe, go to place whenever we are craving a quick bite of middle eastern food. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"To be honest I tried to like this place based on blogTO's recommendation on best shawarma joints and I definitely didn't enjoy it, especially for the price. I felt it was too saucy and small in size. The garlic potatoes were a big let down, was it supposed to be soggy with oil? I guess I thought it was supposed to be crunchy. The servers were super nice tho, but I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Safari is a shawarma spot tucked away in a strip mall with the huge T&T Asian Supermarket. The food is 4/5, The decor on the inside is nothing to write home about. Simple menus on TV screens. I found the combo to be somewhat pricey for what you get compared to Osmows student special where you get a shawarma sandwich, drink and fries for 7$, here it is 10$.   The garlic potatoes here were 5/5. The potatoes are boiled, then deep fried, spiced perfectly, and have a dollop of their garlic sauce on top.  They have a small patio outside where you can eat but your literally in the parking lot. Not a nice view. They have daily specials which is better value and I will try that next time instead. The chicken here was very flavourful, better than Osmows, but not in terms of value.   I guess you pay for quality right?"}
{"text":"Best and cheap chicken shawarma around square1 area.  Very welcoming and humble owner. Must visit place, i go there for lunch often."}
{"text":"I loved the place. Nice atmosphere, polite and helpful staff and the quality of the food was awesome. The food has some East Indian touch and it was really good. Unfortunately because I went there with coworkers, I couldn't take pictures. I definitely recommend this place and I'll definitely go back there! At least to take some pictures and more info! :)"}
{"text":"Going for an early supper prior to my class at Momentum on Wednesday, April 25, 2018, a friend and I accidentally stumbled across the Safari Grill in south east Calgary just east of Barlow Trail South East and just north of Memorial Drive South East.  My friend, who often listens to CBC Radio, liked the fact, mentioned in the restaurant's window as well as inside, that CBC's John Gilchrist had given the Safari Grill a positive review with five (5) stars.  I, a strict vegetarian and mostly vegan, liked the fact that the menu contained some vegetarian (vegan?) options.  For example, the first (1st) item on the menu was a \"Chickpea soup with chevdo (Crisp rice, potato chips, dry cereal, peanuts, lentils, raisin and cashew nuts)\" for eight dollars ($8.00).  My friend and I both ordered the soup as our appetizer and we both heartily enjoyed it.  My friend ordered a tofu dish and I ordered an okra dish [after it turned out that the eggplant dish recommended by Mister Gilchrist was unavailable that day].  The wali (rice) was very light and fluffy, quite unlike the heavy rice I normally encounter in, say, oriental restaurants. And the chapati (roti) flatbread was very good too. :-)"}
{"text":"Top price and Best Shawarma in Mississauga. Customer service is amazing. New Management very friendly. Will go again for best price shawarma."}
{"text":"I was getting an oil change done and looking for new place for Shawarma at the same time. Guess what I stumbled at this venue. The guy serving was quite friendly and was telling me they bought this location from another owner and revamped. The place itself was quite nice, appealing and had decent amount seating.    I went with there Safari's Specialties section and ordered their Safari Triple Delight. Its basically  a layer of Fries, then rice, then salad, and your chicken topped with sauces. The food was good, then meat was tender and they guy wasn't cheap with sauces. They even gave me humus and a special onion paste on the side.   Overall very enjoyable experience!  For my Muslim folks- They serve halal meat."}
{"text":"Safari Grille has a wonderful lunch special called the Karibu Lunch Special it's less than $10 and you get a vegetable curry, a meat curry, a piece of Tandori chicken, rice & naan.  There are usually 3 or 4 curries to choose from in each category.  Nice attentive staff and quick at lunch."}
{"text":"I love their food. The service is always awesome, and I love how amazing they are as a team. Their food is always fresh, and tastes fresh!  Thank you for the awesome food Salima and Aly !"}
{"text":"Best shawarma place I've been to by far great pricing exquisite food and large portions the food is amazing whatever you order personally the mixed grill is best for me"}
{"text":"I would have to say this place is really great. You definitely have to be open minded and want to try something new.  My boyfriend and I went here to try something new we had no idea about the menu or type of food that they served. We were at a loss looking at the menu when our waitress showed up and explained what everything was her opinion on the flavour and she couldn't of been more helpful. She was sweet, attentive and the food was delicious! The decor is great as well as the view. I recommend the coconut curry chicken dish and the lamb vindaloo! Portions look small but they are definitely not! The fries are tasty as well.   Check it out you will be surprised how much you like it!"}
{"text":"Came with a large group and got the chance to try quite a bit on the menu, including the vindaloo, butter chicken, kuku paka, safari grill, masala mogo, and some of the spicy meat tray. The overall impression from the group was that the food was lacking in salt and was somewhat bland. The vindaloo in particular lacked flavour, which was quite disappointing. It also wouldn't hurt the decor to cut back on the zebra/leopard prints everywhere."}
{"text":"So you want Indian food, but perhaps a bit more than just 'butter chicken' and want to try something different? Head over to Safari Grill!  This East African restaurant is amazing. It serves Tanzanian / Kenyan food, which is very similar to Indian food. It looks like a safari in there, with its zebra tablecloths, and exotic dishes. We tried their masala mogo, goat curry, okra and other delicacies. Everything was well-spiced, expertly prepared. Nothing was overly spicy, or overly greasy. They were served in pretty platers and we ate everything up, needless to say.    The restaurant was big, so it looked like it would hold big groups well.  It has made it onto my 'regular' list of ethnic restaurants! So much more on that menu I want to try!   Review #22 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012"}
{"text":"I have gone here for years. First time in months I came to grab a chicken shawarma plate. Noticed was new staff or owner. When I got the plate it seem like I just ordered plate of rice. The chicken was sooo little. Before they use to give you the right amount what you pay. Now it's like there trying to cheap out. Even the salad! They didn't even give more then a cup. I don't know if I will come back. For the amount I paid it's not worth it. It's to bad they have lost a customer."}
{"text":"The ribs are great, we usually get a few plates of suicide ribs (my eardrums are burning just thinking about them), the chicken curry is great also and I love their 4-variety sauces that they place on our table.    If you want the hottest (and best) ribs in the city, stop by Safari grill and try them."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and loved this place as soon as I walked in the door. The safari like ambience is really funky and instantly puts you in a good mood. I started the meal with some fusion ribs and got them hot. They were pretty spicy, but in a good way. Then each of us got the lunch special where we could choose between a beef vindaloo or butter chicken and a variety of vegetable based curries. I ended up getting the butter chicken and eggplant. Each platter came with a piece of tandoori chicken as well as rice and naan. The naan was very soft and delicious. The lunch special here is literally a steal of a deal and at such a reasonable price point, the food here is 5 stars, for sure."}
{"text":"ordered one chicken shawarma plate on fries, it was so fresh and tasty their hot sauce taste very good  and a lot of chicken the guy gave me the staff was friendly my gf ordered one falafel wrap she said it was very good and very reasonable price definitely I recommended and for sure whenever I crave shwarma I know where to go"}
{"text":"Amazing food, the wraps were so delicious! Coming to Canada from Europe, this was the first time we tried the shawarma and we loved it! The atmosphere is very nice and the staff is so kind :) Highly recommend this restaurant, we will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Safari Grill is my go-to gem in Calgary for unreal flavours and a remarkable experience. Ali treats all of his guests respectably and features an unparalleled menu fit for five stars from John Gilchrist! The African short ribs and goat vindaloo are my absolute favourite dishes. Sop up the sauce with cheese garlic naan and you will die and go to heaven after your dinner. But don't die just yet...eat the house-made coconut and pistachio ice cream and then die satisfied."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with the experience. The food arrived at the perfect moment and everything was delicious."}
{"text":"The most disgusting chicken shawarma in my life.  I would have liked to give them a minus 5 star.  They don't deserve even 1 star for the horrible sham of a sharwarma they serve.  This is not authentic and if you are not used to good flavourful food it might just be good enough for you."}
{"text":"I don't know why, but I've ignored this place for years.  Maybe I just figured since it was next to T&T and Golden Turtle that it wouldn't be that good (i.e. a Mediterranean place in an Asian plaza, probably not good), but I was so wrong.  However, being mostly vegan and not having any groceries in my fridge limits my options when I don't want to drive that far from home.    I ordered the falafel and hummus platter for $8.99 which was absolutely delicious and a humongous portion.  It was so big, I probably should have split it between lunch and dinner, but I love to eat.  Per the pic, this came with falafels and hummus, a delicious salad, rice, potatoes, tahini/garlic sauce and hot sauce.  Everything was piping hot and tasty, especially the rice.  I believe it was basmati rice but it had a special sweet salty taste to it which complemented the salad perfectly.  Service was also very friendly.    I dined in and they have 4 or 5 decent size tables, so they can probably fit around 20 people in the restaurant and all the tables were clean.    I looked around and pricing is also very reasonable for the meat options as well and they have daily specials too.    Verdict: If you are shopping at T&T and don't want the salty food from T&T and not craving Vietnamese, this is definitely a great alternative."}
{"text":"Great food in a very casual spot!  The shawarma was delicious and flavorful, food was fresh and the sauces were great too. The owners are very welcoming and you can tell they are passionate about what they do."}
{"text":"Best shawarma sandwich I ever had.   The meat in the sandwich is nothing to brag but the condiments and pickled radishes in the sandwich is amazing.   The price at this restaurant is amazing.   Maybe there are better shawarma sandwiches out there, but for the price, I serious doubt any can beat this place."}
{"text":"Up until now, the only exposure I've had with African dining has been Ethiopian. Given this, I was happy to discover a restaurant in Calgary offering a different style of East African cuisine.   Safari Grill is located at the edge of NE and SE Calgary just a brief walk from the Franklin LRT station. The restaurant specializes in grilled meats and curries with authentic East African flavours. The menu is large and varied, with options to satisfy everyone including a wide range of vegetarian dishes.   On my first visit, I wanted to try as much as possible so I (along with my guest) opted for the Forodhani Platter which contains beef short ribs, a half chicken, and skewers with prawns, beef, and chicken.   Each of the five components was flavoured differently using various dry rubs. To complement the meats, we were provided a quartet of sauces including yogurt, chutney, a brown sweet sauce, and hot sauce. I most recommend the beef short ribs, which are tender and savory.  The platter did not come with any sides, but there are many available a la carte. With this, we tried the spicy corn and the garlic naan. I was happy with the naan, which was large and nicely grilled, but I was disappointed in the somewhat bland corn.  On a future visit, I'd like to try a curry dish with which they recommend ugali, a traditional corn based dish not unlike mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"Wow, just stumbled upon this review I made three years ago. I don't know if it was different staff, better training, or new management, but they've made a huge improvement from before. It's now my go-to restaurant for shawarma wraps and platters in Mississauga.  They have fresh, flavourful shawarma meat coming directly from the spit. However, I think the best aspect of the dishes are that they don't skimp out on the sides. The salad, rice, sauces, wedges, and garlic potatoes are all good.  My favourite dish is the pineapple chicken shawarma platter. It reminds me of the wraps at Montfort, but in much bigger portions.  They have specials each day of the week - most of which are 2 can dine specials.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"Visiting here from Toronto with the family. We heard good things about Safari grill. We ordered spicy mogo, ribs, and a couple of other items. Food was good. 4 star for sure. Service however was not so good. I wasn't impressed that the bill already included a 15% tip. I usually tip based on the quality of service from 10-20%. I didn't appreciate this part especially since we were only 6 people. I can justify a tip for a large crowd but not for 6 peiple at 3:30pm. If the food was out of this world, we could perhaps overlook this."}
{"text":"Have to get the medium beef ribs and beef mishkaki skewers!!!  This place has been a staple for my family for as long as I can remember and we regularly go here and recommend this restaurant to our family and friends."}
{"text":"My fav shawarma place in mississauga and I've tried many! They're sauces and garlic sauce are especially flavorful, portions are large for the price you pay.   Their garlic potatoes are soooo GOOD.   They definitely beat those larger franchises like Osmows with the flavors at this place."}
{"text":"Disturbingly large portions for a low price. Love the garlic potatoes that come with the combo. A great place to get some food before you hit the T&T in the parking lot."}
{"text":"Nice decor and service was good. My wife had the BBQ chicken, with masala fries, it would have fed us both and it was nicely spiced. I had the coconut chicken curry with rice and naan the sauce was delicious, slightly different than standard east Indian curry. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"Best shawarma in Sauga. The meat shawarma is delicious, cooked with lots of spices that add flavour without even needing any condiments. Likewise, all the add ins are great. Make sure to get hummus, garlic mayo, and taheen sauce to top it off. Combo comes down to around $10, you get a shawerma, pop, and a side. Their garlic potatoes are good, but pretty heavy. The lentil soup is deliciously spiced with cumin, very good as well. To be honest everything is good, come try it for yourself and you won't regret it. Absolutely love this place, and the owners are friendly & helpful as well."}
{"text":"A family favorite, this Indian/African influenced restaurant offers some traditional dishes I grew up with. Safari offers great East African barbecue dishes, curries from Africa such as KukuPaka(a coconut cream chicken curry) is a must to try. My usual order is Mogo(fried cassava) Kabob(fried meatballs) BBQ Ribs(marinated beef barbecued) and Pili Pili Chicken (saucy deep fried Cornish hen served with masala fries, curried corn) and top it off with something awesome \"gengeni chicken\" which is fried chicken pieces with chilis and cabbage. Theirs deserts are great but we rarely order them as we are always full with our meal. This place is a must try and experience, the ambience is filled with African themes, and art. Enjoy Africa!"}
{"text":"I was visiting my brother in Calgary and this place was recommended to him by a friend.  It was excellent!  We used to live in Kenya and this place is the best East African place in North America that I have found.  We went twice in the short time I was visiting Calgary.  We tried some curry dishes, samosa, ribs, bhajias, and the ugali.  It was great. It is the real deal for East African food. I wish this place was in LA! So if you live in Calgary or are visiting, check out Safari Grill, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The Mogo is spectacular. The ribs and meatballs are top shelf.  They make a great Falooda too!"}
{"text":"I got the Chicken Shawarma Pineapple platter and it was great! I never seen any other shawarma places have grilled pineapple before, so I had to get it.  The chicken and pineapple were freshly grilled, and the garlic potatoes warm and soft yet crispy. The rice was good too, and the salad was all fresh.  The portion size was good for the price. The staff were very friendly as well.  I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Best shawarma I've ever had, simply delicious.  Very fresh vegetables, reasonably priced, and many delicious sauce combinations. I don't go anywhere else for shawarma anymore.  Also I recommend trying the garlic potatoes, they are fantastic"}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service is atrocious.   I had made reservations for a very special holiday 2 weeks in advance. I asked them repeatedly if they could accomodate us and the significance of the special occasion. They assured us they could. Then after everything was planned , Safari Grill called me on the EVENING of to cancel. They said they were closing early that day and they couldn't accomodate us. Moreoever, the manager did not seem in the least bit worried or apologetic. He rudely said \"we can't take you. sorry\"   I will not be going back there again."}
{"text":"My husband and I were skeptical about trying this place since it's in a random spot beside an Asian grocery store and Vietnamese restaurant but Yelp convinced us it might be worth it.   This review is based on their safari on the rocks - basically chicken on the rocks for those that frequent shwarma places. Their version had the usual chicken, garlic sauce and hot sauce but on basmati rice I think. It was decent in terms of taste (not salty but saucy and tasty enough) and a good portion size for the $11 something paid. The chicken wasn't dry, sauces were good and the basmati rice (had a hint of sweetness to it) wasn't our preference but it was okay when mixed with the other components of the dish. The ratio of chicken to rice was alright - we've seen worse at random shwarma places we have tried. Unfortunately, Lazeez is still my #1 for chicken on the rocks though in terms of flavour and value.  If I'm in the area again, I'd be open to trying Safari's falafel plate or one of their other dishes since they did have several different options."}
{"text":"Came here with my colleague. She was right this place is pretty good. I loved it. I got the beef ribs and they were amazing. Well I got it mild. SO good. Well the sauce makes a difference. The portion is huge. I wasn't expecting it that big for $16. I also tried the mogo fries and they were not bad.   Great service. It was funny how I made  a reservation for lunch. They are usually not that busy during lunch time and I am guessing its because of their location. Most people are at work at to get to this restaurant, you need to drive.   Overall recommend coming to this place."}
{"text":"I've been passing by this place forever and have always wanted to stop in, finally got a chance to last night.  The place itself is a moderate size, which is nice as some of the other shawarma joints run a little on the smaller scale. So, there's room to breathe. This place is also very clean!   Customer service was great, I didn't catch the girl's name but she was friendly.  I ordered the chicken shawarma. Definitely the best meat I've tasted in a shawarma. The seasonings they use really add the flavour to your dish. I find that other places don't season as well. My only complaint is that their hot sauce doesn't have enough heat/kick to it. Of course you can add as much or as little as you want, but I was hoping it would add some flavour, and I didn't find that it did."}
{"text":"Review #7 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012  I love it when restaurants stay open passed a normal lunch hour. It means that when a friend invites me to partake in short ribs at 2:30 in the afternoon, there's a place for us to meet! Thanks Safari Grill.  How does a girl describe this place? Zebra print. EVERYWHERE. Wallpaper, table clothes... and turquoise napkins. Yep. Zebra print and turquoise. Even the spotlights right under the bar were turquoise. Right down to the grass hut roof hanging above the bar, the decor is aptly themed for a place named Safari Grill.  On a Wednesday at 230, it wasn't busy. Maybe 2 other tables in the entire place. In such moments, you're either destined for good service because no one else is around, or you're destined for crap service because whoever's on shift really couldn't give a flying-yelp about being there with so little traffic coming through to earn them their tips. Safari Grill is of the destined for good service service. We were well taken care of and no one forgot about us because they got busy taking care of other things in the mean time.  Onto the food... I was headed out for dinner that evening, so I stuck with two appys. The short ribs are highlighted as the best item on the menu, with shoutouts to a few local celebrities who've also claimed to love them. And since this is the dish I was invited out to come try, I thought I'd better order it. You could easily share a platter of the short ribs with another, there's enough there. You can order them in a variety of flavours and levels of spiciness. I mustn't have read the fine print, because I didn't specify anything here. Just asked for the ribs. I'm not sure exactly how to describe the flavour other than what the description suggests - a mixture of African spices and sauce. I also ordered the bhajyas - fried potato scallops in a special house batter. These were great to try with all of the different little sauces that came out with our appys. I also nibbled a bit of the masala mogo - deep fried cassava with crushed tomatoes and spices. Enjoyable.  I was too full to opt for any entrees or dessert. The only other item that fit itself between the appys was some chai tea. Nothing like a little warmth on a blustery winter day to fill the cracks between digesting food.   Prices are incredibly reasonable for what you get. Food's tasty and plentiful. It's a safe bet to conclude I'll be sampling more from Safari Grill's menu... like from the Safari BBQ!  Also, it's extra cute that Safari Grill uses quotes from local reviewers to shout out some menu favourites :)."}
{"text":"I'm a Flight attendant here on a layover on Valentine's Day... This food really made my night! I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap combo with garlic potatoes and a side of hummus. I had it delivered to my hotel via \"Skip the Dishes\"... Food is delicious the only reason why I didn't give them a 5 is because I paid $4.99 for hummus and received no pita to eat with it :(."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from there and we really liked this place! Food tasted amazing and the portion was great too. We took the mixed platter and the chicken and beef were both really tasty! The hummus was so good, it was my favourite. You also couldn't see the rice below all the meat. We will back."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma was good but don't eat the tabooli. It isn't even tabooli. I'm Lebanese so you can trust me on this or not."}
{"text":"Another attempt at finding those hidden gems in Mississauga and the Yelp reviews shows this as a solid 4 star.  Im not going to knock the people ... I'm sure the owners or at least the family members of the owners were here.  They were definitely interested in your interest to build the platter you'd like... it's not a fast food conveyor belt process here.  I'm just not certain the flavours and food will bring me back.  Safari grill is in a smaller little side strip mall that belongs to the T&T grocery lot.  You can imagine the parking lot situation... it's a bit of madness especially getting in and out onto Mavis.  Safari grill is a smaller fast casual spot with a decent amount of seating.  There's at least 6 tables where you can sit down.  It's clean with an interesting vibrant mural.    Service here is polite and thoughtful ... it can be a bit slow since there's only one person taking your order.  The menu is your typical Mediterranean with prices ranging from $9 and up for platters and less for wraps.  You have your usual chicken and beef shawarma with side salads to add on.  Falafel platter - The positives first... they made the falafels fresh.  I can hear them frying them up so they were just sitting somewhere and stale.  The sauces definitely help perk up the flavours.  So ask for the garlic and hot sauce combo.. I liked that.  As for the rest of it... huh.  My biggest concern this was more like a rice platter.  The container had about 2.5 full cups of rice.  I get that there's filler to make sure you're full but this was just crazy as everything else barely added up to a cup.  Yes you're offered any sauces/dips you want but they weren't flavourful.  Hummus was incredibly oily and not much flavour.  The tomato onion sauce wasn't good on flavour as well.  The pickled veg wasn't bad but I only get maybe 3 sticks.  The tabouleh salad was more than half onions and just a bit of parsley and some tomatoes.  The potatoes were under cooked.  What I'm trying to say is that this unfortunately not even a snack size of edible food after you take out the rice.  2/5  Mixed beef and chicken shawarma platter -  This was about the same as the falafel platter.  Overall, it was a bit unremarkable if you take out the super huge portion of rice again.  All the same issues showed up here as they did in the falafel platter.  The beef and chicken were ok... they werent overly dry but could have had more flavour.  3/5  Seeing the other reviews, I'm not sure what happened here.  Im hoping this is a one off for them because I certainly cannot recommend it based on the food.  I know this is a fast casual operation but I would at least expect to enjoy a meal that wasn't only rice and lacking flavour."}
{"text":"Good food.  Was a little surprised that it seemed to be mostly Indian food.  We went expecting something a little different and ended up just ordering one of the thali dishes.  It was quite tasty.  I would have given it four stars but the bathrooms were a bit funky, which always makes me question the condition of the kitchen.  But the service was great and the food, as I said, was very tasty.  I didn't find it as different and creative as I had hoped when I went in looking to try African food.  But I would definitely go back if I'm ever in this part of the world and want good Indian food."}
{"text":"Definitely visit this beautiful restaurant with authentic East Indian African food. I lived in East Africa a few years ago and this place reminds me of the beautiful times I had.  Here you get fried cassava, called Mogo, sprinkled with chili powder and served with truly authentic green chili tamarind and coconut chutneys.  The beef ribs here are awesome. The flavor is great, right on the money. It's a strong paste of spices but it's not overpowering. Especially when you balance the ribs with staple dishes like the cassava, rice or ugali.   Which brings me to my next point. Ugali is a staple that you get in certain parts of East Africa. It's meant to be eaten with a fried savory masala fish, spicy boiled greens or meat. It's nice to see it on the menu.   The food here has always been fresh, delicious and a real treat. Everything I've ever ordered here has been good, kababs, samosas, ribs, tandoori and Mogo.   Definitely visit this lovely restaurant with great authentic East African food. Plus the service is always excellent too."}
{"text":"What a letdown!  We came here because of all the positive Yelp reviews. Upon stepping in, I noticed the inside is bare and a bit grungy. Hopefully the food would make up for that, right? I got the chicken shawarma combo with the garlic potatoes.  The garlic potatoes were alright but they were super oily. The chicken shawarma wrap was absolutely massive and they don't skimp on the condiments. Unfortunately, that was all that was positive about it. The chicken tasted dry and bland, and I've had waaay better shawarmas elsewhere. My wife's dish was even worse. It was the falafel and hummus plate. There was a tiny amount of hummus, and the falafels were hard and dry. Again, you can get waaay better falafels elsewhere."}
{"text":"As I am writing this review I am wondering to myself \"you gonna do it? you gonna go buy a shawarma wrap for dinner?\".  I am so lucky that this place is close to home. The chicken shawarma wraps are SOOO delicious. The chicken is flavourful and moist. The wraps have great traditional options to compliment the chicken wraps and their potatos are also very well seasoned."}
{"text":"The quality of food and its price is impressive! I always order 2 wraps with my boyfriend~ BTW the potato is sooooo good"}
{"text":"I had a shawarma craving and wanted to try out Safari Grill after the good reviews.   I am giving this one star for a long piece of hair I bit into and pulled out. It really ruined my appetite! The hair wasn't just on top when I bit into the chicken shawarma. It was deep into all the chicken pieces. I really was looking forward to having a delicious dinner but it turned out hairy.  Unfortunately I brought the shawarma home so I was unable to go back. I was thinking of calling in but doubt anything can be really done when I wasn't there. So disappointed in the experience.   I took a picture of the long hair."}
{"text":"My go to shawarma place. They really ensure you feel at home by their welcoming attitude. The chicken shawarma is very tasty and succulent. They have a special garlic sauce which steals the show. The ingredients are always fresh. They also serve the special garlic potato which is very akin to the Bengali aloo dum. Portions are generous. I have also tried the chickn poutine. They also have a daily special . All in all I love the place. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Came for lunch randomly today, and I'm very glad we did! the decor is pretty wild (animal print everything - love it!) and it's bigger than I expected - lots of room, nice & bright with lots of windows. even though it was an odd time of day, there were lots of other tables seated.  The menu was a bit crazy, so many items, but we chose a couple dishes to share - Afrique Mishaki with pili pili chips (a platter of chicken skewers and corn and amazing fries, $18) and Viazi Na Koliflaa (roasted cauliflower with vegetable rice and roti, $12) and there was definitely enough food for the both of us! So good! All of it was delicious. Service was friendly & attentive, and our server was great with explaining dishes and was kind enough to let us know the cauliflower dish came with rice so we shouldn't bother ordering another rice dish! that was nice! Can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"(UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT NOW, SO REVIEW IS OF PREVIOUS OWNER)  Best Shawarma/Falafel!!!  I usually get the salad with either chicken or falafel, its always a good sized portion, great taste and always fresh. The falafel is very tasty, soft and fresh would definitely recommend!   The service is friendly too :)"}
