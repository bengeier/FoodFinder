{"text":"What a lovely restaurant, amazing food and service and atmosphere, definitely I recommend it for everyone. The Penne with Alfredo were YUMMY!! And omg the Nutella lasagna is super super delicious !!!  Best pasta ever  I can eat this every day  Fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"All the toppings were ice cold....there is nothing less appetizing than ordering a hot bowl of pasta and then having ice cold mushrooms from a can dumped on them. Also, the servers were really mopey and didn't have great hygeine. They kept scratching their heads while cooking and complaining about life. This place will be closed within 8 months - it's nothing special."}
{"text":"It is cheap and quick which is a plus. It's a place you go to because it's 'right there' and you just don't have the energy to make pasta at home. I am confident the average person could probably make themselves better pasta than this place. It is a good price and the alfredo sauce is better than you would expect for a fast food pasta place. I was too afraid to try their tomato sauce. I had the fusili with chicken and parmesan. Portion looked small when I got it but I was filled up for 6 something with tax, which includes a fountain drink. The pasta was over cooked, not seasoned and all clumped together. It seemed good at the beginning when wrapped in the sauce but since it was all clumped together the sauce just sat on top and the rest of the pasta was sauceless and tasteless. The chicken was good, well seasoned and moist which I was impressed by. I would go again as a last resort honestly but not a place I would have a craving for. I do want to try their Nutella lasagna though because I'm a self-loathing Italian."}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Pasta Mondo.  It hasn't been there very long.  I love pasta so I thought I'd give them a try.  You order in steps ... choose the size, the pasta (the different kinds of pasta have different cooking times, which range from a minute to six minutes), the sauce, your protein (that costs extra), your cheese and if you want veggies (that also cost extra).  I got a large, fusilli pasta (one minute to cook), arrabbiata sauce and chicken.  With a bottle of pop and tax, it came to $13.    To honest, I didn't have high hopes for my meal and I wasn't disappointed ... it was awful.  The pasta had a weird texture.  I had intended to eat it there but because the cheese wasn't close to being melted, I took it back to the office figuring the cheese would melt on the way over ... um no.  I stirred it in with the pasta to help it along.  I ate about a quarter of the pasta, picked out the chicken and ate it, and threw the rest in the garbage (I hate throwing out food).  There were two staff.  The fella taking the orders and making the pasta looked miserable, was unfriendly and didn't seem like he wanted to be there.  The cashier was a bit but not much better.  I definitely won't be back."}
