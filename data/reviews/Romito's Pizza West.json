{"text":"The great thing? The Pizza. The worst? Customer service. Immediate Blacklist. Wow..."}
{"text":"I eat Romitos on a regular basis, and have for many years. The pizza is awesome, the prices are good, and the menu offers much more than just pizza. I routinely order the Texas-style chili, which is amazing, and I've tried a few of their other side items as well. The menu also offers some good sandwiches, wings, ribs, traditional pizza shop side dishes (breadsticks, etc...), and some other Italian food items as well. As far as pizza toppings go, my favorite toppings to get at Romitos are pepperoni, sausage, and meatball. Their sausage is very good, and the meatball slices are to die for!!! Romitos also offers delivery service, in addition to a sit-down dining area if you prefer to eat at the restaurant. Although I normally get carry-out, I eat in the restaurant every now and again when I'm with my friends, and the service is always great. Plus nothing beats a Romitos pizza fresh out of the oven. Overall, Romitos is a great place to get a great pizza, and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great great pizza, super affordable. Romito's has been one of my favorite places for a while now. Great fluffy crust and a sauce that is to die for. I always order extra sauce on mine cause I just can't get enough! Good place to stop in with the guys and grab a pie for lunch or buy full sheets for your parties."}
{"text":"We are so happy to support Romitos!   Sauce makes the pizza good and they do sauce well!   We always get a half sheet (only 12 bucks - 15 with one topping)."}
{"text":"love love this place! Great PIZZA! I even love the crust! I get the small for lunch. The people are friendly the service is fast! I love the old cash register it adds to the place. A must try if you love pizza and even if you don't!!"}
{"text":"We are from Pittsburgh, and were in town for a soccer tournament. We decided to grab pizza for dinner. Best decision of our trip, the pizza was phenomenal! Hands down the best pizza I've ever had. The crust was dense and soft on the inside. The cheese was high quality. The sauce was the perfect sweetness. I will go back every chance I get!!!!"}
{"text":"Romito's was a last minute decision....and a GREAT one!  The people were friendly, including other diners.  The food was awesome. We went back a week later and will go back again when we are in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza..we were on our way back to Chicago from the OBX. We stayed over in Independence. Chicago has great pizza everywhere. We didn't expect much, but were pleasantly  suprised. We ordered two full sheets. Pizza was very good. Bakery style crust not salty at all and great service from the people there."}
{"text":"Romito's is my family's go-to place for party pizza.  It's not my favorite pizza, but it's quick, convenient, and crowd-pleasing.  We've always had good service there, too.  I've had their pizza many, many times.  In general the crust is thick and doughy (which may or may not be your thing), and there is a lot of cheese.  I wouldn't go so far as to say they're stingy with the toppings, but I wouldn't say they're generous either.  They use canned mushrooms, not fresh.  I have not been impressed with their salads (mostly iceberg with a few toppings sprinkled in), but their homemade Italian dressing is very good.  They do have coupons on their website and in the local circulars, so look out for those before you go."}
{"text":"I have taken Romito's for granted too long.  I finally moved away and won't be back, and just thinking about it makes me sad.  They have the best pizza I have ever had.  It was indeed greasy, but that's from all the cheese and toppings they put on it.  The crust is crisper but still doughy, a tough feat to accomplish.  The sauce is tangy and sweet, and it's a quality cheese on there.  Take my advise:  get sausage onion and bacon if you are into that thing (and who isn't?). Really worth the drive to pick some up.   If there is only one pizza place in Cleveland, this should be it!"}
{"text":"From Columbus and stopped in for local pizza. Pep and sausage was incredible. Sausage is true Italian with plenty on spice"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza here for my Super Bowl party a day before the party. I went to pick it up and my pizza wasn't even ready. I told them the day before that I'll pick the pizza up at 6pm. I got to romitos place 10 minutes before 6p and I have to wait for almost half an hour for the pizza that I ordered a day before the super bowl! The bad part about my pizza is wasn't cook right, the middle is uncooked! We ended up slicing it individually and put it back in \"our\" oven for half an hour! So disappointed and they rated this place 4 star? What a joke! Sorry but I'm not happy about the wait and uncooked pizza!"}
{"text":"I come to Independence for business every few months.  I have tried several local pizza joints and have been unimpressed.  Being from Chicago, I may be a bit picky when it comes to pizza.  However, this place has the best pizza in town for sure.  It is one of the best pizzas I have had outside of Chicago, even beating pizza places in NY. The person who answered the phone reminded me of Eor from Whinnie the Pooh but was polite.  You can only order hand tossed but is tasty. The delivery was quick.  This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Ok I wanted to give this a 2.5 but since there was no .5, I rounded down. What is everyone raving about?? This is average AT BEST. Pizza Hut is way better to give you a culinary yardstick and we were buzzed! so my old college roommate's cooking would have tasted like Wolfgang Puck. Very average, and the wings are AWFUL. Plain wings with hardly any sauce coating them and no blue cheese, carrots or celery."}
{"text":"The bread sticks are terrible. The pizza was good though but nothing special. There is a $2 delivery charge nobody told us about either so be prepared for that."}
{"text":"Extremely good and greasy pizza.  I was quite surprised and impressed with this place and that was with a mere 2 topping pizza.  Surpassed Antonio's by far.  Will definitely eat here again if I find myself trapped in Independence, OH."}
{"text":"First off- my food gets 3-stars (Pepperoni Lunch Slice was small and mediocre. If you want more people to go there for Slices they need to be gigantic and loaded  & way too greasy Medium cheese to-go)-However I know I ordered the wrong thing. This is your Local Pizza Parlor staple, family owned and you can feel the love. The Italian dishes looked great. Grab a sheet pizza with some toppings your set, and they are under $20! Rock on Romitos!"}
{"text":"Medium crust that soaks up most of the grease; very pasty tomato sauce, a bit acidic; lots of cheese; and the sausage was chunky with some seeds inside giving the sausage a texture some may or may not care for."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best pizza in the Cleveland area. The owners are super friendly and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Pizza is thin crust and delicious - best in the area! You don't really need any other toppings. Salad with house dressing was really good as well."}
{"text":"we get the pizza and romitos salad almost every week. simple and delicious. i like to ask for the pizza crispy...then i think its perfect."}
{"text":"These guys are awesome. When Dominos dropped the ball on a pizza order for my sons birthday, they came through last minute with delicious pizza ready on time, and threw in a bonus pizza cutter. Thank you Romito's!"}
{"text":"had their white pizza said flavored with herbs and spices, well i was so dissapointed because everything else i have had their was good, but this pizza was too hard and full of black pepper no basil, oregano like what's supposed to be on a white pizza.  wow what happened romito's??????"}
{"text":"I've always loved Romito's and it's what I compare every pizza sauce ever to. And pasta sauce. I love the fluffiness of the sheer pizzas and the cavatelli and meatballs are wonderful.   Nothing in the area can even compare. I do, however, wish they had the ability to have a full bar or something. It'd be a nice place to hang out, eat, drink, and watch a game.   The employees are okay, owners are fine, but I feel like the staff used to be better in years past. We used to know every driver and would even give them extra tips around the holidays because they had been their for years, but now it's like a new stranger showing up once a week (yes, we generally order once a week or every other week)."}
{"text":"I asked the guy over the phone about the pizza and the food he said it's great I ordered i end up ordering a pizza it was a disgusting the whole pizza was under cooked , the wings were under cooked and very expensive do not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Pizza is my favorite cheat-day food, so I have sampled my fair share of pies. The only pizza that rivals Romitos is Giardonos in Chicago. Everything that goes into a pizza at Romitos is made from scratch in-house. They hand-shred their cheese off the block, make the sauce, cook the bacon, etc. The shop is locally owned as well, by a hard-working independence family with four young children. The mouth-watering, heavily-topped pizza is baked fresh-to-order and will certainly fill your belly without draining your wallet. Romitos is one of the best parts about living in Independence!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area - hands down! Although I do like the sheet pizzas better then the smaller - something about the crust!   Great service and on time deliveries! My family has ordered pizza here for at least 20 years!"}
{"text":"I will say this. The pizza is good. HOWEVER...the delivery staff was terrible and wrote something offensive on the order ticket. I will NEVER recommend them due to that nor order from them again."}
{"text":"Not only is this the best pizza in Cleveland but the nice employee came to my rescue and killed the fuzzy scary spider inside my car that decided to dance around my front windshield while driving to pick up my pizza. I love this place, pizza and employees!!!"}
{"text":"Went in looking for a grinder, no luck. Was going to order a sub, but cook suggested they were known for pizza. Ordered 3 item, result was awesome. Great crust and sauce, hand-cut green peppers, cheese just right. NOT your chain store; pizza done very well. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Last night in Cleveland and needed something quick and easy without having to leave the hotel. Ordered large pizza with half pepperoni. Sauce and toppings were delicious, but the crust was a little too pillowy for my taste. Still great price and flavor for what I ordered. Next time I'm in Cleveland I'll order from them again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Northeast Ohio. Mike and Mike are great guys!  The dough and sauce are spot on.  The bigger the pizza I feel the better. I usually get the half sheet for with the office or my Wife and kids."}
{"text":"The best pizza that I have had in the Cleveland area. Not cheap BUT so worth it  Freshest ingredients and lots of them. Great crust, especially when crispy. Delicious when hot and the next day after a night in the frig------to die for.  Bob, N. Royalton"}
{"text":"Stopped by for dinner... not so bad. I ordered a small meat lovers pizza sub the meatballs and ham for green peppers and onions with a side of onion rings. My total was roughly $14. If you are dinning in the dining area appeared to be clean; plenty of tables and they have a tv... I was able to watch some of the football game while waiting on my pizza. The pizza was decent. It's kind of hard to explain but it taste like the ingredients were cooked put on the pizza and run through a warmer; onions definitely had a raw taste... not physically like a mouth watering pizza that I envisioned. The onion rings were good and the customer service is great. I'm going to go back and try something different."}
{"text":"Romito's makes a great pizza. Thirty years ago, before the pizza chains showed up, this was the kind of pizza you could get anywhere in Cleveland. The crust is fresh and made right. The sauce is real and there's plenty of toppings. They don't want you to buy chicken mcKickers or other nonsense. They sell real pizza that is really good. I drive past at least three other pizza places on my way to this place and it is worth it.  The people who work there are old school. They take your order, take your money and give you a pizza. Nobody is smiling or wearing a goofy uniform. There's a football game on in the corner and they pay more attention to it than to chit chat with customers. Pizza. Good pizza.  Get it to go so you can wash it down with plenty of cold beer at home. It is not really a sit-down kind of place."}
{"text":"Call in experience was rushed. They are obviously slammed in Saturday night but still, think good customer service. Pizza crust was burned on sides and bottom. I have a house full of people so I can't return it. I won't be visiting again"}
{"text":"What a let down,  I haven't been in town in 25 years, this was the place we hung out after our HS football game and you can't even walk in at 5:30 on a weekend and get A SLICE,  they try and force you to buy a \"small\" pizza, I'm one person.... Not cool"}
{"text":"Romitos is my family's favorite place to get sheet pizza for parties or special occasions. I ordered a sheet pizza last week and the pizza was coming right out of the oven as soon as I walked in at pick up time. The people that work there are always working hard to get you the best quality pizza they can offer. The pizza is consistently good every time we go there and we have never had a problem."}
{"text":"We've lived now in various cities (Cleveland, Virginia Beach, Atlanta, New England) and travel quite a bit. Romito's is by far our favorite pizza.  The dough is perfect. The topping are superb. We would order sheets (insanely cheap) when we had friends and family over. Odd how I would always \"accidentally\" overorder which meant we had Romito's for days after.  One of the best tests for the perfect pizza is how it tastes the second day. And Romito's not only has the best day-of pizza, but the reheat beats all other pizzas as well.  Can't wait to be back in Cleveland to take the kids."}
{"text":"I was at a party on Friday and talking about pizza. A guy there was talking about how great Romito's is. So I drove out here yesterday. I wanted something that I could eat late night also after having a few beers. The pizza is really greasy. My friend suffers from heartburn, and this pizza really can activate that. I didn't mind it though. Out of the plethora of pizza places around Parma area, I don't know if I will return."}
{"text":"TUJM dam you. This place has a Huge place in my memories. I grew up near the original on St. Clair. It was small. Mostly take out and pizza. It was the meal for my 21st b-day. We ate it even though Mary dropped the box upside down when her and my sister arrived at college house. 5 second rule and rocks can be picked out. The success is the care that the family puts into this business and the relationship they have with customers. Local products are used. People travel to get this food. Living in Akron briefly before moving out here. The college boys would make trips 35 minutes to get a pizza. I'm not sure they should have driven, but... Growing up as a kid. Romito's pizza was our stop when not cooking. Dad coming home on a Friday night after work or just ordering up an 8 cut. We picked it up after 10pm if that says anything about a place that at one time was only big enough to have two tables. We watched Big Chuck and Houlighan/Little John. We always got the sausage. I have yet to find a place that has that style of sausage and cut. I tried once to even find out where they had it made. All i got was it was special made. That seemed to please the \"kids.\" We always got the sheet pizza for parties. 15 or 30 depending on the size and/or other food being brought.  The show Wings had \"the big sandwich\" but we have Romito's. The menu is now more extensive. It still feels like going to someone's house and getting good old style food. Gnocci is on the menu and I would be hard pressed to find it at a restaurant of this size out here. The family was always asking about me and work after moving out of Cleveland. Dad still made stops and other friends that we got hooked would come down to the original. People travel for this.   It has always been a stop when coming home. So now with the original closed. I'll have to make a detour. Hoping i can get some delivered, as on my next visi,t I'll be staying downtown. Romito's is comfort food for our family just as meatloaf etc.    Seriously TUJM thanks for sparking the memory. NOW have one shipped to me."}
{"text":"This is pretty good pizza, but it is not what I really like.  I have eaten the pizza here several times.  The crust is a little on the soft side, bordering on soggy.  I think they use provel cheese, which is stringy and chewy.  Personally, I prefer cheese with more flavor, rather than a mound of cheese."}
{"text":"It's a shame I have to give them such a low rating, because they really do have potential; the sauce and crust are nicely flavored, and you can tell they're made fresh in house. However, the problem lies in the people who make the pizzas. They make some of the sloppiest pizzas I've ever seen; they can barely cut the pizza into equally sized pieces, and the toppings and cheese were put on very unevenly. I've eaten there several times despite this, hoping that maybe I was just experiencing the byproduct of a busy rush, but they've consistently given me sloppy pizzas. I'd still give the place a try in case they've gotten better though."}
{"text":"The pizza was delicious. We ordered double cheese, pepperoni and half mushrooms and half green olives. I enjoyed every bite. We ordered garlic cheese bread sticks. They came with real cheese and a meat dipping sauce. Very tasty! The meat sauce was a pasta sauce and we were eating it plain it was sooooo good."}
