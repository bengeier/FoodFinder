{"text":"Hipsters and cocktail aficionados rejoice! Madison has a cocktail lounge that puts the Marvel Bar to shame... or at least seriously green with envy. We arrived on a Saturday night around 6:00pm and the place was packed! We did not realize that it was restaurant week in Madison so a lot of the tables were reserved for people that were going to be taking advantage of that wonderful event. We were just there for the booze, plain and simple. The ambiance is very cool. Industrial chic - lots of concrete, glass, reclaimed wood and Edison bulbs. Lighting is dim, giving it a an intimate feel. If it was not SO crazy busy, it would be a really cool place to go on a date. I would say that they could benefit from some sound dampening. Maybe a rug or textile somewhere, because it can get awfully loud in there! I asked our mixologist for a whiskey sour (note - they're not bartenders. These people work magic with cocktail shakers and unique ingredients, they almost look like mad scientists or apothecaries with the amount of tiny glass bottles they work with) and it was absolutely the BEST whiskey sour I have ever had. It was done traditionally with the egg white foam - but I loved that there was a bit of orange essence and (I swear I could taste it) nutmeg or cinnamon? The prices are what you would expect at a higher end cocktail lounge - but given the quality, I would say you are getting away with a deal. The drinks are smooth and delicious with really nice top shelf alcohol. If you are looking for a place to broaden your boozy horizons, then you have found it here!"}
{"text":"I've always been told to try everything twice. My wife and I had come here once and while the meat plate we ordered with our drinks was good, the atmosphere (loud thumping music that prevented us from talking) left a bit to be desired. Our second time around, on our anniversary, my wife ordered a pork skillet and I ordered a burger. Her pork was so fatty that she couldn't finish it, and my burger was so unbelievably salty that I had to stop after a few bites. I have never sent back food before, but I've always been able to choke down my food; not this time.  The waiter was very nice about it and got us free desserts as well as taking my burger off our bill. I'm just baffled that someone let that go out the door. I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"A bit pricey, below average service, but really delicious.  Went to Merchant right around 5 on a Thursday night and asked to be aware outside. We were told the patio was reserved at 6:30, and we said we could be out of there well before then.  Our waitress didn't come to the table for 10 minutes, though in that time we were given water by someone else. We ordered drinks and an appetizer, which also took a while to come out. When the waitress put the drinks down, she mixed them up, which was fine because I noticed as soon as I tasted the one in front of me. My partner had already downed half of the drink that I ordered though. Oops. The drinks were good, and fairly strong.   The Patatas Bravas were pretty good-- crispy, though I wanted more flavor in the Harissa aioli. I didn't sense any heat at all.  For our main courses, we had a beet salad (small for the price), Thai tomato soup (deliciously spicy and served with huge pieces of Texas Toast), and brat sliders with frites (served in foil, dripping with grease and a bit difficult to eat, but packed with flavor).  Generally, the service was really slow, and we ended up leaving after 6:30, I think to the dismay of the anxious-looking hostess. The fare was really good, if a bit pricey. I'll definitely give it another try!"}
{"text":"For being the number one cocktail joint in Madison, I thought I'd be getting better drinks than those I make at my house.   I wanted to be wow'd but I was disappointed. Had a Moscow mule and a Mojito and they were both missing a touch of love. The mule wasn't muddled and the mojito was a majority soda water and could use a hint of simple syrup and more mint flavor.  Don't rush the drinks, make em to perfection!"}
{"text":"As others have said, it's all about the cocktails. They have a very large (and slightly overwhelming) menu of specialty cocktails to cover a variety of tastes and whims. I have truly enjoyed every drink I've had there, even though my wallet takes a bit more a hit than I'd like.  The food (tried the beef carpaccio, cheese curds, fries, pork pappardelle, lamb sliders, classic burger), while nice, is not on the same level as the drinks. I wouldn't make a point to come here for a meal, but perhaps share a light snack along with a cocktail.  The biggest hit here is the service. I've never felt like the servers have been interested in answering my questions about the menu, the food is very slow to come out (even on an empty week night), and the servers disappear, when I am ready to order, could use a refill, dropped a fork, want the check, etc. A Wednesday night dinner should not take close 3 hours."}
{"text":"I like the food and drinks here, but I can echo the sentiments posted here about slow service.  In addition to that, I went here for my birthday celebration on a Saturday evening to dance and enjoy the music.  The DJ actually said to me, and I quote: \"I don't take requests.  Go away.\"  Seriously?  I can appreciate that DJs don't always want to take requests when they're in a groove, but being rude is unacceptable.  We took his advice and promptly took our business elsewhere.  However, after submitting my complaint via Facebook, the manager contacted me and apologized for all wrongdoing.  I REALLY appreciate this kind of humility in an establishment, so I'll be going back (and I'll only approach the DJ stand if (s)he appears to be taking requests!)"}
{"text":"Love, love Merchant's.  I only go on weekday evenings, because I don't like the packed crowd on weekend nights.  Love the bartenders and the food.  Nuf said."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. There's a couple of places around this area, we were seated right away before I got too busy. Try the Cheese Curds and cheese platter"}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I went here for dinner just the other night. Loved the atmosphere and the staff was great. Cocktail menu is extensive and creative and we both thoroughly enjoyed ours. They also have nice beer and wine lists. We shared an appetizer of a buttermilk green salad which was disappointing; way too much bleu cheese. However, our entrees were great; she ordered scallops and I ordered a pork sausage pasta dish. Dessert menu was very limited so we ended up going elsewhere for dessert. Overall great experience, we likely would go back and are looking forward to trying their breakfast"}
{"text":"Cocktails are king at this establishment, but the food is worth noting as well.   The Regret (Gin or Vodka, lime juice, and rosemary cocktail) has knocked me off my feet a number of times and has left me understanding how it got its name.  This doesn't stop me from continuously frequenting Merchant nor from ordering The Regret with each visit.  :)  Although everyone should stop by Merchant simply to try the cocktails, the food is something that shouldn't go unnoticed! I have been here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and have left more than satisfied each time.  The Eggs Benedict is top notch and so is my go-to breakfast dish: eggs, bacon, and a side of potatoes (if you think it's easy to perfect over medium eggs, you're sorely mistaken!)   There's a reason this place labels themselves as \"Madison's original craft cocktail bar,\" but that shouldn't be the only reason you stop in."}
{"text":"Every cocktail I've ordered from their menu has been amazing. When I tried to order a standard martini it tasted like pure vermouth. Food is good, but you can find better for less money around the square."}
{"text":"Craft cocktails made by hand.  Bartenders are artists.  This is not a bar to have a Miller Lite or a Captain and Coke.  In fact, I would suggest to ask the bartender to surprise you.  I can assure you they will."}
{"text":"Why people rave about this place I will never know. They talk about craft cocktails here and  I find the cocktails and the food to be \"meh.\" It's just the location and that is all. I'd skip it as it is overrated and certainly overpriced."}
{"text":"I came here just because it's where my friends were going.  I wasn't expecting much, just wanted a burger and a drink.  I ordered a double vodka, and it was a huge awesome pour.  Definitely not complaining about extra liquor.                    I've  made lots of Aioli myself, and theirs was so tasty.  I'm guess they use some lime/lemon juice in the Aioli, and they use much more than I do in mine (which I think I liked more).                         Got a burger, and ordered it medium rare.  THANK you, cooks/chefs back there for actually cooking a medium rare right.  It really was one of the best burgers I've ever had.                           The bill took a little long, but it was super busy, so meh... not really a big deal to me.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, comfortable atmosphere, beautiful interior, delicious drinks.  This is the perfect place to go for a warm and cozy winter meal.    As for the reviewer who made the comment about how we're not in New York so \"good luck\" with the grocery store bit...  I guess they are trying to say that Madisonians are uninspired and shouldn't try to bring something new to Wisconsin.  Go for the food. Enjoy the drinks and atmosphere. If you feel so inclined, purchase a gourmet ingredient from the grocery store.  What's not to love?"}
{"text":"First of all, the factors that contribute to the 3 star ranking are the ambiance and the cocktails.  I love the interior and the setting.  I also really enjoy all of the craft cocktail combinations.  Now for the negatives.  While I think the cocktails are fun, $9 is a bit high for Madison, even given the quality ingredients.  The service has been below par on my visits, with empty water glasses or disappearing waitresses.  I would say that the food is \"hit or miss\".  I loved my $6 Brussels sprouts, but my husband's minuscule $19 steak was not as impressive.  That kind of inconsistency seems to be the case for the other menu items we have tried.  Overall, I am definitely happy to have a new option in Madison, and I will stop by again for a creative cocktail."}
{"text":"We love this place except their tables are too small!! (Even with a reservation) If you don't make a reservation they stick you in an aisle with a tiny table.  That aside the food and drinks are awesome! We drive into Madison 2.5 hr round trip once a month to eat here."}
{"text":"Lighting is poor. I was there with a hearing impaired person who, once the sun went down was unable to communicate. Very loud music with echo. Could not see the food I was eating. May be great if you are under 30 but not over 60. Between 5 of us, the Gnudi was the highlight.  Service was POOR."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Merchant twice now -- once during Restaurant Week and once a couple months later. For restaurant week, they basically offered their entire menu for $30 instead of the usual $25. They had bargain priced wine and we got a bottle of great wine for $24! My only complaint was that they could have definitely gotten away with making the portions smaller and staying at $25 because I was completely stuffed, even after letting my husband finish my entree, which was pretty much the best thing ever.   The burata is amazing, the buttermilk salad was good but under-seasoned, and my husband loved the mussels and the beet salad. He also liked the steak and the classic burger But we both agree that the best thing on the menu is the rigatoni with peekytoe crab, which I've gotten both times we've gone. I am not a pasta person, but the rigatoni itself is so perfectly made and cooked, and the crab + sauce are to die for. This dish is the most expensive on the menu, but it is worth every penny. I also highly recommend the Sea Salt Caramel Gelato."}
{"text":".Merchant has a great location in a reasonably convenient place near Capitol Square.  I also liked the interior as it is convenient and comfortable.  Staff is also upbeat and can't be blamed for any shortcomings.  Madison, however, is not New Glarus and needs to be met at a higher standard.  I am reminded of a comment a friend from Ireland used recently, \"It lacks something\".  I know that it is focused on specialty hard liquor drinks for the kid set and is probably jammed on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.  However, we were there on Sunday.  I tried to order the moule frites, but they only had enough for part of our table.  I did, however, get to try them.  Merchant needs to visit Bistro V to see how moule frites are supposed to be done.  Both quality and quantity were lacking.  My companion asked for some of the advertised Rhubarb jelly to go with her selection.  It was touted as \"from the farm market\".  Well, Ms. Chef,  you had better check out the locally grown product more carefully, as this stuff could have been grape squeezings or almost any other fruit base, as it was totally characterless.  I used to make stuff like this out of whatever came to hand years ago, and I could never tell the source either.  For potential visitors, check out the menu before you go and then call ahead to see if they will actually have your choice.  Offerings need both updating and a broader selection in my opinion."}
{"text":"This is strictly about the music.  First rule of being a DJ,, you take your cue from the crowd. The DJ for the night (5/9/15) did not take his cue from the crowd!!! While you can keep spinning to get the crowd to \"move\" with you or \"fee\" your personal style, if after 4 or 5 songs they still aren't moving with you, in essence \"at least 50%of bodies moving or dancing to your spins,\" you are not responsive to the crowd!!! Supply and demand economics, \"Merchants\"-- from a qualitative researcher."}
{"text":"4-stars on the food, 5-stars on the cocktails. True craft cocktails in Madison are not as rare as they once were, but this is the first place I had a drink and thought to myself: \"I might be in San Francisco right now.\" Down-to-earth as all good Midwestern bars are, Merchant offers specials on high-end punch and \"lawnmower beers\" in cans.  The fresh, handmade, and local initiative isn't just hipster talk; good drinks and good food go hand-in-hand here. Daily specials, weekly menus, seasonal cocktail selections, and loads of creativity with just the right amount of deference to tradition. Hip Capitol Square restaurant, modern cocktail lounge, and weekend local DJ dance party, this chimeric venue is great for people-watching too. And if you need to watch the game, there are TVs above the bar. The biggest plus for me and many other service/retail-industry people is the 7-day a week late-night food menu. A life-saver on many an occassion.  What to eat: Chicharrones, if they're available. Definitely squirt the lime over them and listen to the snap, crackle, pop. The burgers. The foie burger is amazingly rich and flavorful, and the house burger (with brisket on top of the burger) is a go-to winner. House-pulled burrata makes a pretty nice meal on its own. Seasonal salads are healthy and hearty, and the desserts are hard to pass up.  What to drink: Um, anything in a cocktail glass. The mixologists are skilled at twisting the old fashioned notions of cocktails and modernizing them with highlights like pipe smoke tinctures, liqueur rinses, and fruity/savory shrubs. And they're exceptional at \"just making something\" from their extensive bar of craft spirits and home-made bitters, syrups, and tonics. On Mondays, and occasionally at other times, they'll have a special punch made up for a pretty reasonable price. This season, the Carolina is one of my favorite cocktails ever, Smoking Barrels is a unique must-try concoction, and The Regret is a great go-to savory drink that reminds me a lot of the first craft cocktail served to me at a bar in San Francisco. (P.S. Their wines selection is okay, and tap beer selection is refined and craftily good.)  And don't worry if all you want is a rail rum and Coke. They'll make that for you too."}
{"text":"Brunch, dinner, ambiance and drinks, Merchant is the real deal.   After returning to Madison (after living on the coasts) and finding Merchant, it brings the bigger city vibe and energy, with a cool local down-to earth staff and a lot of locally sourced ingredients.  They have a DJ/music scene at night too, though if music isn't your thing bring your earplugs as the decibel level can make it a bit hard to hear after 9 or 10pm but it's a good looking crowd if that is what you are after.  Their Tuesday night late night tacos are one of my favorite late night foods in downtown Madison!     Meal of choice:  Steak and Frites + Cheese Board to start  Drink of Choice:  Moscow Mule or the Regret Brunch:  Famer's Market Omelet of the week (seasonal) Suprise:  Check out the drink menu.  #mixology at its finest"}
{"text":"Food-wise, the Merchant is mediocre, especially given the price. They use quality ingredients and have an interesting menu, but the taste does not stand up. I've gone a few times for both brunch and dinner, and was each time disappointed. If you are craving new ameican brunch, heritage tavern is far better."}
{"text":"Was delighted to discover this gem off of the capitol square when I was in town for an on-location shoot. Cocktails were inventive and delicious, food was memorable -- excellent salad and nibbles. And the decor is fun -- a little Wisconsin hipster heaven."}
{"text":"The food was good but not knock my socks off for the price.  Definitely meant more for the cocktails and drinks. Since I'm pregnant, I missed out on that side."}
{"text":"I had the pork pasta. Was good!  My partner had the burger, also good. Large drink menu. Super cute decor. Good wait staff!"}
{"text":"I don't often give 5 stars but when I do it means something.  I had been wanting to try this place for awhile and last night it did not disappoint.   We had reservations for 5 people and arrived a little early. Had nice drink at the bar. They have an amazing craft cocktail menu. We had the old fashioneds and they were excellent.   We had the cheese curds for an appetizer and the sauce was outstanding. We had the mussels for a \"second\" appetizer and they were amazing. The sauce they were in was so flavorful and the mussels were so large. The garlic bread on top was delicious.  It was burger and beer night so 4 of us had the burgers. The brioche buns were toasted just perfectly. One person had the pork pappadelle. The homemade ricotta and pasta was delicious.   We didn't have room for dessert but maybe next time.  They also sell bottles of liquor I believe and have a whole wall with liquor and wine displayed. The atmosphere was great.  I typically don't go back to the same place too often if it is downtown because I like trying different places but I'll be back here."}
{"text":"The drinks were excellent (especially The Regret) but the service was horrible, (my friend even got spilled on by the waiter!) and the food was even worse. The west side burger was overcooked and bland, and the steak and frites was fatty and tough. It was also extremely expensive. I would say only go here for drinks, and only if you are willing to pay ten bucks a drink!"}
{"text":"Nice ambience, decor in a neat modern space. A tad noisy, so if you're looking for romance, you have been warned :-). We were a group of 5, so it wasn't an issue for us.  Unfortunately food makes or breaks my restaurant experience.  Food was overpriced and underwhelming. The beet and hazelnut salad was decent. The Halibut was bland and flavorless and at $23 for a small 4 inch square, not really worth it. My boyfriend got the chicken confit, which looked large but was mostly bones and overcooked skin. The best dish was the Brussels and Lemon - nicely flavored and well cooked.  Service was slow - drink refills took 20 minutes. The check took about 20 minutes to get to the table after asking for it and took about 20 minutes more to be processed.  Overall, needs work. I won't be going back for their food."}
{"text":"Out of all the many cocktails I've had in Madison, the ones at Merchant are the best. I enjoy making cocktails myself, so I like a place that can at least do better than I can at home. And Merchant definitely does. The drinks are imaginative and the flavors are always well-balanced. There are a lot of places in Madison that try really hard with complex syrups, liqueurs and unique flavors, but then end up failing on the execution somehow. Merchant consistently does it right. My all time favorite drink here is actually just a nice, classic whiskey sour. The cheesecurds are also amazing (if a bit salty, even for cheesecurds), and they're served with a really delicious sauce."}
{"text":"Worst bar ever. Gave my friend the wrong card. Wouldn't correct the mistake? Tried to tell her she paid 80$ with a cheap tip even though she had another persons card and bill in her hand. Which she had tipped out at 100% because she is a good customer. They were unwilling to correct the mistake or apologize and jerks about it. See you never Merchant. Every other Capitol bar is better than you."}
{"text":"Hands down, best spot in town. Everything from the ambiance to the service to the incredible menu, Merchant Madison has got it all. It is no wonder the wait time can be up to an hour for a table. My roommate and I had to call two days in advance to get a table for two on a Friday night. The menus are seasonal so they are always changing which is awesome because I am someone who loves to try new things. The winter cocktail menu is out now and there are some drinks on there that will rock your world. If you can only have one, definitely get 'The North Remembers.' It is rum based and absolutely delicious. Also, try the meat and cheese board. An excellent appetizer to start with while you peruse the menu over and over again because you won't know what to get because it all looks so stinkin' good. If you are only going to be in Madison for one night or if it is the end of the world, this is the place you have got to go to."}
{"text":"Cocktail amazing, smoky sweet wonderfully crafted. Cheese selection also delicious, selections with a honey comb, buttered toasted rye,and a cherry chutney/jam.  Mussels on the other hand not cleaned properly. Lots of sand, and spent my time picking off the beards; too bad."}
{"text":"Everything here is lovely. The staff was friendly and professional. The place was busy on a Wednesday night but it felt private and quiet due to the lighting and decor.  The food couldn't have been better. Good soup and steak and deserts were amazing. We definitely will be going back- probably many many times. I want to try everything on the menu, it all sounded good. Definitely try this place. Even if you're only in Madison for a short time, you don't want to miss this one."}
{"text":"I didn't eat anything here but we stopped in on a bike tour through Madison and each tried a cocktail.   The cocktail list here is quite lengthy and I really had a hard time deciding which one to get (especially since we made the rule that you couldn't get the same thing as anyone else).  I ended up with the Hi-ball Punch and was very pleased with my choice.   It was my favorite out of the 3 drinks that I tried.  The other two drinks tried were the Reconstructed Cup and The A Train.  All 3 of the drinks were very strong.    We really didn't have any problems with the service.  The waitress was great in helping us narrow down our drink choices and then even gave us some information on some of the other stops we planned on making on our tour.    This place isn't huge but I hear that it gets pretty packed on the weekends.  It seemed like a fun place that I'd probably frequent if I lived in Madison but for now, I'll just have to remember to visit when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Food and drinks never disappoint. In fact, there's no place better for an after-work bite to eat and delicious drink. However, service is hit or miss at best. There's no in between: you'll get the best service of your life or the worst. Unfortunately, it's usually the latter, which keeps this from being five star."}
{"text":"Food is so-so. Nothing special. If anything, come here for drinks. They have an extensive cocktail menu - my favorite? The Regret, you can't go wrong,"}
{"text":"To be clear, this a review for the bar/drinks, NOT the food, as I have never ate there.   The Good Delicious cocktails. Really delicious. And seasonal with impeccable ingredients.   The Bad A little pricey. At 10:30 it turns into a super obnoxious club.   The Ugly Essential, I think Merchant has an identity crisis and needs to decide what it is. They are so confusing. Are you are nice restaurant known for your fancy drinks? Are you an upscale dining/alcohol selling experience? Or are you a clubby joint that has super alcoholic drinks? I can't rectify all of those things. I think this place could be great if they focused on one thing."}
{"text":"Merchant is one of the most ambitious restaurants to open in Madison recent times.  You'd think the laundry list of lunch, dinner, late night, weekend brunch, and extensive craft cocktail program would be enough.  But they also offer an edited but tasteful grocery, along with retail beer, wine and booze.  Both the food and the beverage program are built on a foundation of ingredients and presentation.  The bar is well suited for those looking try something new, as well as seasoned veterans looking for a proper old fashioned, negroni or whiskey sour.  The place gets loud during late night and the service seems slow due to the labor intensive cocktails.  Yes the staff is attractive and the patrons are typically quite stylish, but last I checked that was a good thing.  Craft cocktails aren't cheap, but be nice and the bartender will offer you a free OGD."}
{"text":"Very good drinks! Served by very attentive bartenders. Really good pommes frites! We were the oldest people there on a Friday night  & they were  Really nice to us!"}
{"text":"The food here is overpriced.  It's not bad, but expensive -partially due to the locally acquired, fresh ingredients- and small portions combined with poor service keep Merchant from reaching it's potential.  The carrot soup came highly recommended from a friend, so I tried it.  $7 bowl seems a bit steep.  It simply wasn't worth it for me.    I've had the meat plate and it is great.  Each portion of meat high quality and very rich in flavor.  Same can be said for the cheese plate.  If you stop by, and you have room for an little something before dinner or want to keep it light, I suggest these.  The tongue stood as one of my favorites.  The hand crafted cocktails on the other hand are made really well.  Even though they are $9 or so a pop, they are done very well.  They take a bit longer to make, but they are made from scratch with fresh ingredients.  I particularly enjoy the Regret and the Aviation.  This place started out really well, but the last half dozen times I've been there, the drinks have been sub par (compared to previous visits) and unfortunately, I cannot recall a time when I've had a great server.  Specifically, not behind the bar. Typically, there are lots of errors made and it feels like I'm always inconveniencing my waiter/waitress.  Which makes you feel like a burden or a bother but ultimately, not wanted.  Give it a shot if you're in the area.  The drinks are worth a try. The best way to experiences Merchant is to let it compliment the rest of your night.  Stop by for a cocktail before or after your dinner elsewhere."}
{"text":"Visited the bar only this evening. Great spirits and an extremely welcoming staff.  Ambiance is very cool as well. Definitely will come here again."}
{"text":"Came here on a madison food tour and came back for dinner.  Loved the farm to table concept.  Great find!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner/drinks during my bachelorette party and it was perfect for us. The food was good, and the cocktails are great. What took this place to the next level was the service. Even though I was not decked in any sort of bachelorette gear that night, the waitress asked if we were celebrating anything. When we told her it was my bachelorette party, she brought us little shots of champagne- so nice! The entire night she was extremely accommodating and knowledgeable about the cocktails. She made it clear that if we ordered one and didn't like it, she would replace it with something else, no questions asked. Overall we really enjoyed this place and I will look to come back next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"As usual, the Merchant offers great cocktails - new fall drinks are also now out (a few of my favorites are their versions of a sidecar, blood and sand).  We also go for the great food - the apple/squash ricotta board was amazing (a fall change from the radish board), I recommend this over the cheese boards.  Handmade pasta is always a go to and leaves me happy!"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined here last night.  We thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  We really enjoyed the ambiance.  The modern warehouse / butchershop atmosphere appealed to us.  It was upscale casual.  It reminds me of Sardine - maybe same owners - not sure.    Some reviews have mentioned the noise level.  It was loud, but in a good way.  It was loud enough that we didn't feel like everyone was listening to our conversation or that we needed to wisper.  However, not loud enough to prevent us from having a conversation.  I had beer, while my wife sampled some of their cocktails.  She had a whiskey sour and some sort of punch (the special for the evening).   Their drink menu was substantial.  Excellent selection of cocktails, beer, and wine.  The food was very, very good.  We started with two of their toasts.  One had truffled white beans and prosciutto, the other was lardon and radish.  We thought the bean and prosciutto was excellent.  The lardon and radish was just ok.  Perhaps we don't enjoy lardon as much as we thought.    My wife enjoyed two small plates - beet & hazelnut salad and pork belly & lentils.  The salad was good, but the pork belly was outstanding.  I ordered the BBQ pheasant.  It was divine.  They made a sausage from one of the thighs and leg.  It was wrapped in a cabbage leaf.  It was used as a pillow for the rest of the dish.  The rest of the pheasant was nicely roasted and served with a southern style (mustard based) bbq sauce.    I know this review is long, but I would be negligent not to mention the service.  It was fantastic.  Sadly, I do not remember the gentleman's name would served us.  He was great - especially by Madison standards.  He was extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  He also took the time to explain various aspects of the menu without us having to ask - small plates, large plates, toasts, etc.  He made some great recomendations and followed up later to see if we enjoyed what he suggested.  This was one of the best meals we have had in Madison in a long time.  Granted, we don't get out much anymore thanks to two little boys under the age of two.  Regardless, the combination of atmosphere, drinks, food, and outstanding service makes this a place we will definitely return to."}
{"text":"I just tasted four of the best cocktails I've ever had the pleasure of sipping. With super-fresh ingredients mixed in inspiring combinations, the drink are worth their cost, for sure. The...second squadron (I believe) was particularly delightful: playful grapefruit anchored nicely with Creme de Violette, stunning and simply delicious. Also, the fresh egg whites add a delicate and delectable element when employed. I highly recommend. The food was also phenomenal. Best prosciutto in Madison, excellent small plates. I will be coming back for the charcuterie! And finally, with a commitment to locally-sourced ingredients, in both food and drink, I don't think there could BE a restaurant that's more up my alley. Maybe it's your alley, too?  P.s. I didn't drink all four ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to Merchant twice for apps and drinks. We had the cheese plate (delish, but a bit pricey) and some amazing cocktails. Prep takes some time, but I think it's worth the wait. Excellent bourbon selection, nice atmosphere and best drink garnishes in town."}
{"text":"Try the cheese curds and the sea salt and caramel gelato. One of our new favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Was here for a friend's bachelorette party. BEST cocktails in Madison. Highly recommend the high violet. Great service and ambience"}
{"text":"Merchant looks like a trendy cocktail bar you'd find in a city like Boston or Chicago. I've been for brunch, dinner, after-show drinks, and for their dj/drinks- most of which have been very solid experiences.  As everyone says, their cocktails are amazing. They remind me of the cocktails I'd get at speakeasy style bars in Boston- very innovative flavor combinations and although they're more expensive than a majority of other cocktails in Madison, you can tell why (on the plus side some concert tickets will have an ad for 20% off cocktails at Merchant the night of the show + if you check in on Yelp you get a discount). One fun special they have is a bartender's choice where you get a mystery cocktail for $6. In my experience these are typically more of your \"everyday\" cocktails so they're not as interesting as the cocktails on the menu but you can get two of them for the price of one of the more specialty cocktails.  The food has always been very consistent. For dinner I had the Merchant burger which was incredible- super flavorful, rich, and juicy, everything you would want in a burger.  My dining companions had the lamb sliders and the moules frites- both of which they thoroughly enjoyed (the lamb sliders in particular). The cheese curds are also one of the better curds I've had in Madison.  For brunch we had the Ploughman's board, the mussels, warm quinoa salad, croissant egg sandwich, and the pork posole. The Ploughman's board was presented beautifully and had a nice balanced assortment of cheese, meats, and pickled veggies.  The Mussels were very plump but I was caught off guard by the cream broth they were in. It was tasty, just not what I was expecting (but was very happy about the ample amount of madison sourdough bread it came with).   The warm quinoa salad was very tasty- the quality of the ingredients they use really showed in this dish (as a side note I usually try to refrain from ordering dishes I could make myself but they did a great job of blending the flavors together) The croissant egg sandwich was good- the cheese on it was delicious but it was slightly too salty for my taste. The mixed greens it came with were super fresh and delicious- I wish there had been more for me to put in my sandwich as well as eat on the side. The pork posole was a very generous portion and they had most of the toppings on the side in DIY pho style. Overall the food quality is very good and you can tell they source fresh ingredients. The dishes might not necessarily knock your socks off but it's consistent. Overall I preferred the dinner dishes to the brunch ones but they may just be due to what I ordered.  Ambiance wise I really enjoy it for a late dinner or early drinks, it's a little dark for brunch and during the late night hours when they have a dj they seem to turn off all their lights making it hard to navigate around (even for my 20-something year old 20/20 eyes).  I read some reviews where people complained about the service but for the most part I've always had really good service whenever dining in."}
{"text":"The service, the food, the drinks, the vibe, the creativity....I could go on!  Just fantastic!!"}
{"text":"I tried Merchant when it first opened, and I was underwhelmed to say the least.  It was not particularly vegetarian friendly, and some of the plates just didn't come together quite right.  Since then, I have been back several times.  What an improvement!  Service:  The staff is enthusiastic and helpful, but a little on the unseasoned side.  I have always been satisfied, but not awed.    Food: The menu has improved significantly!  In particular, they have a roasted root vegetable and kale dish that is outstanding.  It is the only really vegetarian option on the menu, but it is plenty for me. My carnivorous friends have also been satisfied with their meals, particularly the half chicken.  Skip the roasted nuts as an appetizer.  They are pretty bland.  But, go for the olive mix.  I thought they were delicious.  I have been a little underwhelmed by the desserts.  They are good comfort desserts, but lack the complexity of other options on the square.  Atmosphere:  I love the decor and atmosphere.  It pushes the restaurant from 3 stars to 4 stars.  It is casual, trendy, inviting, and unassuming all at once.  Do plan to go before 9:00 though.  When they close all of the gates on their liquor displays the restaurant starts to feel less welcoming and more like...well..a closed liquor store that is waiting for you to leave.  Ask to be seated away from the door if you can.  The interior seating is much more pleasant."}
{"text":"This was our third visit to Merchant, in the past the mixology has been fantastic. So we went for the fixed price menu for Valentines Day.  Extremely disappointing. Watery small drinks, boring options, all of which were clearly prepared well in advance.    It was like Merchant knows that they are a Madison No Brainer and they totally phoned it in.  This should be their opportunity to shine, not be half ass.  Absolute vanilla.  We will think again. Bummer."}
{"text":"We came here after a wedding.  We were hungry and looking for a bite.  Didn't know too many places around Madison.  I found this place on Yelp. We ordered the late night tacos (3 each).  I asked the server if they were the authentic Mexican kind and she replied that they have a twist on them."}
{"text":"6 of us ate here tonight. Nice looking place, friendly staff. Food was terrible and nothing came out hot. Too dark to even read menu. So loud you could only talk to person beside you. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I like: incredibly tasty food, curiously crafty cocktails, and super eloquent menus. A+ to the attention to detail. The drink descriptions were entertaining and informing. I enjoyed the atmosphere at the bar but it was really dark (and the tvs are small just FYI)"}
{"text":"So I finally made it back to Merchant to try their brunch / lunch, and it was terrific. While I still think that the menu is a bit thin on the main-dish veggies, there are a few options on the menu. I had the kale benedict and a mimosa -- all very nice! The kale and the lovely poached eggs make for a really nice balance, and I'll bet that pancetta makes it even better if you like meats (although I got it with just the kale). My husband and my friend were also both very happy with their meals (the daily scramble and the omelette), and my friend adored the virgin cocktail that the bartender made for her. Delicious.  Merchant is really lovely in the early afternoon, I have to say. It's a lot quieter and less busy than the dinner hour, which makes for better service and a calmer atmosphere. If I still lived in Madison, this one would definitely go into the rotation of delicious brunch & lunch places..."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed with this place.  They did a great job with the way it looks but service was very disappointing.  When you're paying that much for a drink you expect a little better service.  I won't recommend it or go back again.  Our bartender was actually rude and ruined the experience for us.  I stand corrected.  The owner of Merchant proved to be a class act, as I was given a $5 gift card to come back to the Merchant and had a totally different experience.  I had bartenders who didn't know the answer to my friend's question/mine, and they asked around until the found out.  They were personable and the drinks were great.  The only reason I give it four out of five stars is because it's a bit pricy.  The outdoor area's great!"}
{"text":"The drink menu is outstanding and the bar area was a good time.  The food was also excellent, especially the brussels sprouts and chicken entree.  My only gripe is that the steak wasn't as tender as I thought it would be.    This is a great place to visit by the Capitol!"}
{"text":"Food and service not good! Everything is severed with baguettes.... Pasta is soupy... Service is terrible they brought the pork pasta dish when we ordered the vegetarian.  took forever to come back to table... no flatware.  Food and service was just not good."}
{"text":"I love this place. They make the best cocktails in Madison. Their plough mans platter is also spectacular."}
{"text":"This place is okay--the atmosphere is a little dark for my taste, but the drinks are excellent. I would not recommend going here for dinner, or else you'll leave hungry, but the appetizers taste pretty good."}
{"text":"Went to Merchant last night with 8 girls and it was SUCH a great experience. First off, I'm new to Madison and didn't realize how most places require reservations or else you have to wait. I called at 3:30 pm on the day of this gathering and the hostess was SO nice in getting us a back area for drinks at 7 and then we were seated by 8:30 pm. The service was awesome, the food delicious and simple with fresh flavors and reasonable prices. So why only 4 stars? Even at 8:30 pm, you had to shout to hear each other and to the waiter in order for him to hear our order. Totally understand that kind of volume after 10 pm, but not at 8:30 pm. Other than that, totally a fan and will certainly come back for happy hour or an earlier dinner or brunch."}
{"text":"Yes yes, the cocktails are excellent.  I have been to Merchant many times and enjoyed them.   However, what good is a nice cocktail if your evening is ruined by poor service and uncomfortable seating?     No one to greet or seat us, which is ok, but then do you have to unceremoniously kick us out of the table we chose (when the place is half empty)?  This isn't the first time I've had a bad experience there either.  Another time I was seated for dinner, and then over 20 minutes passed before someone came to serve us.  Anyway, I suspect that will be my last visit.  If I'm going to spend $50-100 on drinks and food I'd rather be treated with a little more respect and friendliness.  My recommendation to Merchant?  Cool concept, good food, great cocktails.  But please work on the service a bit.  Better training and organization, and perhaps more staffing would be called for."}
{"text":"I like this place! They pour pretty strong drinks, and they always have a delicious variety on their menu. It gets a little too loud on nights when they have a DJ, but it's still fun. It's a nice place to go for a drink date or something."}
{"text":"Fabulous find!  The basic breakfast with distinction!  The best fried potatoes.   Must try the homemade raspberry ouree jam.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Merchant is amazing. You truly can't go wrong with the cocktails. The food is delicious, too. Monday burger nights are the best. Friendly staff and warm ambiance. Definitely one of my favorite spots to grab a bite and a drink or two or three in Madison."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Great food and really tasty, unique drinks. Try the Dangerous Summer. Also their cheese curds and chocolate plate are the best."}
{"text":"Wow. Expensive but amazing fresh and local dishes and fantastic cocktails. Was a nice treat for a special occasion but very pricey, especially if you don't stop at just one of their specialty cocktails!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails, apps and entrees!  Romantic, funky and rustic atmosphere.  A MUST in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Cool idea with old fashion decor and rustic feel. Unfortunately not well executed. Very dim hard to see person across from you, let alone what your eating. Also very loud. Don't like being drowned out by noise. Hard to rate food with other yelp stars because of noise. This is what made it a 3++, and not a 4--. Good stuff great service, delicious buffalo deep fried cheese curds (kudos for multiple cheese). Beer was highly flavorful and small but various list of beers on tap. Useful yet decorative hanging fruit basket made a big impression with the food starz. Unfortunately the warmer than room temperature water was a debby downer.   For the reasons above only 3++ with the yelp starz"}
{"text":"Maybe we just ordered wrong. Maybe we're just LA/NYC snobs. We heard Madison was foodie heaven and to try the Merchant. Sorry y'all this is just Applebees with better quality ingredients. The Merchant has all the fixings of a great restaurant but it's execution is, in my eyes, majorly lacking.   My fianc√© and I shared the mushroom bisque, blue cheese salad, french fries, and salmon. We orders two of their new summer cocktails.   Mushroom bisque was room temperature, I like the whole vegetables in it but it was overall creamy and cold and the bread it was server with was sticky, doughy, and cheesy for a baguette. Sour cream dollop on top was not needed.   Blue cheese salad was horrendous. The blue cheese was fantastic and fresh, so were all the ingredients, but it was practically a slaw there was so much dressing. I couldn't finish it, and by the end the blue cheese had all smushed into the salad so it was more of a paste than a slaw. If the ingredients are so good, let them speak for themselves not all yell together. My stomach hurts.   The fresh fries were delicious, a bit over salted but whatever.   The salad with the salmon was great, the salmon itself was. . . cooked poorly, half dried and burned on the outside, raw on the inside, never seen anything like it, and I know why.   The drinks were the saddest part because of all the hype around the cocktails and their special elixirs. Given that they said these were new drinks and they were open to feedback. But, (1) straws should very rarely be served with a nice cocktail. Stirring straws, okay, big sippy straws, naw, it's not a soda. (2) Ice, too much, too cold, again, not a soda (3) drink itself, just bland, too sweet just tasted like a standard mixed drink, or sub-standard, something I'd get handed at a frat party.   Gah, sorry, really wanted to like it. Service was great. Ambience was mostly nice except for the ugly floral pattern on the columns and the sub-par chalk work above the bar.   Great intentions but the foodchefs and the barchefs could use a revamping. I bet the burgers are dope."}
{"text":"Merchant has a great atmosphere and I've had some good meals there, but lately the service especially from the hosts has been horrible and extremely pretentious.  The last time we ate at Merchant we were told to wait almost a half hour, while the whole time they had a booth open right in front of us. When they finally sat us in THAT booth, they told us they had \"just had a cancellation\" It looked to us they were waiting to see if a larger party would come in before seating us. And, after all that, the meals the three of us were served were room temperature and bland.   Prior to that, we stopped on our way elsewhere for drinks to ask if we needed a dinner reservation. The host said \"no, it's slow it won't be a problem when you come back.\" An hour later we return to be told it would be a two hour wait! When we complained to another host that we had been told there wouldn't be a wait, she immediately sat us. What kind of games are they playing?? First, a two-hour wait and then they could seat us immediately after we complained??  I'm sorry, but I don't care how great the \"vibe\" is, we won't be going back to Merchant anytime soon. I'm tired of the service games they're playing. Sad because at one time this was our favorite restaurant, but now it's always a frustrating and disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I've been here several times, but this was my first time for brunch.  Merchant has an awesome vibe, and is always a fun place to go.  I've always thought they had quality food, and brunch was no different.  I got their biscuits and gravy and a spicy Bloody Mary which were both excellent!  I also had a corpse reviver, which brings me to my only gripe with Merchant, the drink was really great, it was unique, and delicious but I just think their craft cocktails are too expensive.  If you're really into cocktails you will love this place.  If you're not into cocktails, not to worry, this is still a good place to go, with great food and generally has a pretty good beer selection."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a drink and appetizers.  The craft cocktails from their BIG drink menu book were awesome!  We had the cheese curds which were pretty good.  The breading was good and the ranch was delicious!  My girlfriend got the soup.  Cant remember what kind but that was super tasty too.  Would definitely stop in again!"}
{"text":"We had lunch there on Saturday with a group of 5. The restaurant was not full, maybe about 2/3 of the tables occupied. We sat for a long time waiting to see a server. My wife finally asked the hostess if she could send one over and she seemed annoyed that we asked. When the server did come over, we said we were ready to order. His reply was \"So I heard\" !  No sorry about the wait, or anything like that........ So, we ordered and the waiting began again. It took about 45 minutes for our food to arrive, and in the meantime two tables that came in just after us had eaten and left.  The food was pretty good, but it was far overshadowed by the lousy service we received. Going back? I don't think so......"}
{"text":"This place is great! Both the cocktails and the food are delicious. We got fried cheese curds for the table and I highly recommend them. They are probably the best ones I've ever had. The lamb sliders were slammin as well."}
{"text":"I decided to give merchant another try today after the first visit there for drinks and dinner was disappointing.Lunch today disapointed just the same.I expected the food to be better for the expensive prices you pay.I ordered the parsnip soup and a bbq beef sandwich.The cup of soup was very small but tasty.The bbq sandwich on the other hand was not good.The sauce was yellow and tasted like nothing but mustard,no hint of bbq sauce anywhere.On the menu it said the sandwich came with fried onions and those were mysteriously absent.I returned my sandwich and asked for a grilled cheese instead.The grilled cheese was good but expensive at $6.99.The best part of my sandwich was the pickle that accompanies the meal.We went over the lunch hour and the place was practically empty.They have a build your own salad option, but it seems like every other ingredient you want to add costs extra.That takes the fun out of that concept."}
{"text":"The food is solid.  I just wish they would change the menu a bit.  If a restaurant is based on local produce the menu should change drastically with every season.  My favorite thing on the menu is the Ploughman's platter (meat and cheese board).  This has constant variation, interesting types of pickles and something extra.  The drinks are really delicious but the club atmosphere is not what I am looking for on most nights."}
{"text":"Have great drinks!  DJ is a lot of fun and the back room is fun for dancing.  Was also there for Margarita night and they do have great margaritas.  Dance area gets very crowded,but for the most part, everyone is pretty friendly.  Was shocked how quickly they made us leave at bar close.  Got a drink at 1:50 and was kicked out at 2:00.  Most bars will let you finish your drink."}
{"text":"Made from scratch cocktails and a fresh local menu. Bartenders were knowledgeable and friendly. I was fortunate to have stopped in on Burger and Beer Night. Great value. Very good beer menu and the burger was outstanding. My old fashioned was perfectly crafted. The only thing keeping me from 5 stars was the bartender became distracted by \"younger, cooler, hotter \" clientele."}
{"text":"Being the obnoxious New Yorker, I was annoyed that after 10 minutes no one had come to our table to take our drink order.  When I (nicely) said something to the hostess, they were falling over themselves with apologies, gave us free appetizers and then free desserts.  The food was delicious, the waitress was great (after the initial hiccup), and they redeemed themselves 100 times over!  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I stopped at  Merchant one Saturday after hitting the farmer's market. I was feeling frisky, so I ordered a bloody mary along with a salad and oatmeal.  The bloody mary was FANTASTIC--the magical stuff they put on the rim had me licking my lips the rest of the day.  The salad was just right--nice, shaved fall veggies and a light buttermilk ranch dressing.  Even the oatmeal was good. Granted, it's hard to mess up oatmeal--but it was served with large portions of brown sugar, cream, and sliced apple.  Scrumptious. And the atmosphere was lovely. I've heard dinner is fantastic, so I'll have to try that out! I've got my eye on the wild salmon! Yum!"}
{"text":"Totally great and looks so fun!  We were in town for one day and night only.  We tried to hit up this place for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, but there was an art fair in the area.  Disclaimer - we are not art kind of people, so I made a mental note to stop on our way out of town.  So, we hit up Merchant Madison for brunch on a Sunday morning.  We were there relatively early, 10:00ish and it wasn't too busy yet.  We really enjoyed everything - the food, the service and the numerous bottles of liquor for sale.  See, we live in a state where you cannot buy booze on Sunday or any place other than a liquor store, so it's always entertaining for us to see something like this.  I had a breakfast sandwich on a biscuit, cuz all of the sudden I love biscuits? and my husband had a Two Egg Breakfast.   The biscuit was quite delicious and not dry, with the egg and cheese and ham, it made for a perfect way to end our trip to Madison.  I always think I don't like salad with my breakfast, but I actually really do and need to remember that.  While waiting for brunch I was eyeing up all the good looking craft cocktails and my husband way eyeing up all the scotch, rye and bourbon on the menu.    This will be a must stop for some cocktails our next trip."}
{"text":"I've never eaten here, but the cocktails are awesome. There's about a million to choose from, from traditional to wacky craft cocktails, and I've never had anything bad. Definitely on the pricey side, but an excellent option for a classy pre-dinner drink."}
{"text":"I had one day in Madison for work and came here for dinner. I got a Moscow mule to drink and the curried squash dumplings to eat. Both were absolutely delicious! All the bartenders were super attentive; great service.  I don't have any plans to come back to Madison any time soon but I know that I'll come back here the next time I do."}
{"text":"Menu is amazing (drinks especially) but the weekend dance club is AWFUL if you want to talk. I stick to weekday lunches and I'm quite happy."}
{"text":"I dined at Merchant last night, and was thoroughly impressed.  The cocktail and bourbon list was impressive.  And the food was fantastic.  We particularly enjoyed the duck, and the pork belly with lentils -- great comforting food for a cold rainy night.  While the space is urban and hip, the service itself was top notch, and unpretentious.  It is fine dining without the high prices and without the attitude.  A great addition to the Madison dining scene.  We will most certainly be back, and look forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Really nice dinner at this warm, friendly restaurant.  Food is locally sourced.  Interesting menu with good variety.  Attentive staff.  Good value."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and drinks are great, but that's all I recommend going for.   We ordered the burrata, some kind of fish spread, and the pork parpadelle. The pasta was fine, not amazing but fine.  The spread was meh (but kinda what you assume it would be, so you can't be mad). The burrata was actually quite bad. It is a disservice to call it burrata, it was liquidity (not gooey, as it should be) and lacked flavor. I've had store bought cheese better than this.   Worst of all, the crostini was soooo hard; difficult to eat.   With that, just go for a drink before dinner or for a date, don't eat here."}
{"text":"Good food, fun staff. Crowed much? But it was fun.  I'll definitely come back to try another meal. Meal cost is welcoming. And their olives are amazing!  :)"}
{"text":"If you enjoy craft cocktails, sit at the bar so you can watch the bartenders at work. Menu is full of classics as well as some unique options. Cool history bits about some of the drinks as well."}
{"text":"This is one of few places in Madison I'd give a sixth Yelp star if possible.  Merchant has it down- THE BEST craft cocktails, check- their drinks are the standard by which all others in Madison can be measured. Plus the bartenders are truly artists- fun to watch them create. Fantastic service, check... their staff is pleasant, hip but not snobby, accommodating (especially when it comes to subs for food allergies!) and warm.  Gorgeous aesthetic- check. The space could seem cavernous but instead the smart decor makes it feel inviting and bustling yet amazingly, not mindnumbingly loud. Great menu, check- something for everyone and changes with the seasons.  I've taken my parents here, my foodie friends, my teen daughter, my NYC friends used to the swankiest locales, and had a joint birthday party here with a friend and 15+ people; nobody has left disappointed.  I love their ricotta board, the steak frites is my favorite entree, and one really can't go wrong with a burger (especially the Merchant burger, which is a rotating invention based on seasonal ingredients) but I've never had a bad meal here. I do agree with some other reviewers that Merchant's brunch/lunch options aren't as inspired, but my go-to (steak and eggs for brunch, fried chicken sandwich for lunch) is always awesome.   Final note- front of house manager is incredible. Everyone lauds the bartenders here (with good reason- they rock) but the woman who runs FOH is so graceful and savvy, and it shows in both her attitude and her servers'. Wish all Madison restaurants had someone like her at the helm.  For example, last summer during a Live on King Street concert, my friend and I put in for a table outside and we were told there would be about a 45 minute wait.  We were texted via their reservation alert system about an hour later that our table was ready.  We went back and they had no tables outside; We were fine with both having waited the extra 15 minutes (not unreasonable considering the estimated 45 minutes) and with being seated inside, we didn't complain though it was a bit of a bummer- regardless, the manager apologized, seated us personally and purchased our first two beverages.  Classy!"}
{"text":"I like the brunch. Love the interior decor. Very crowded at night, can barely get up to the bar. Pretty typical of trendy bars in the area though."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our evening at the bar at Merchant. The fianc√© and I shared several stouts from the tap menu and had one too many Bafo de Tigre cocktails. Kudos to the man who was able to make a truly exciting and different drink using cacha√ßa and other traditional Brazilian ingredients (lime, sugar, etc). I would have been thrilled with a well-made caipirinha but this cocktail took it to the next level - smoky, tart, a little sweet. I wasn't starving so I had a salad, which was fine, and fianc√© had the fish fry, which was also fine. Good, but not particularly better or worse than any other fish and chips in the world. The vibe at the bar was awesome and we really enjoyed chatting with the bartenders throughout the night. Would definitely return for more cocktails!"}
{"text":"I love the craft cocktails.  The bartender was awesome and funny!  I can't wait to go back here!"}
{"text":"My past few experiences at Merchant have been good but not great (with one terrible exception due to an overzealous brunch DJ on his last day of employment wanting to \"turn up\" a room of hungover guests looking for low lights, soft music, and a refuge from most human interaction). The food is good but not overwhelming. They have spruced up the place here and there. The one thing that remains is their excellent cocktails! Definitely one of the most inventive menus in the city and still the first true mixology bar in town."}
{"text":"Merchant is where I go to hobnob. The atmosphere is dark with a smidge of swank and the drinks are on point with a smidge of expensive. They often boast solid live music on Thursdays and DJs for grooving late nights Friday and Saturday.  Do I giggle when bartenders refer to themselves as \"mixologists\"? Yes. Will I refer to them as such with a straight face in order to get my hands on a Jack Rose (aka my favorite cocktail in town)? Of course. And I knock off a star because the Jack Rose is only made available when their house-made grenadine is in stock. I'll bring in my own store-bought grenadine if I have to. Girl's not too proud to lug syrup around in her purse.  Most recently ordered their brat sliders and get.outta.town. Delicious. Next up, I've got my eye on their late night brunch menu. Brunch...10PM-1:30AM...that's my kind of crazy."}
{"text":"Awesome cocktail menu, fantastic service, great environment, and the best fries I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"Unfortunately our night out at Merchant Madison was a bit disappointing. While I can compliment them on their ambiance, unique menu and customer service, the food was a bit overpriced for the quality I received on my plate. The house burger that was recommended was incredibly greasy, so much so that the bun fell apart. The fries were delicious but cold. Each person's food was about 20 dollars so I was expecting a little more then one person to leave satisfied. The pros? We had immediate seating on a busy night and the waitresses were very cheerful and attentive to our outdoor table and definitely did their best to address any issues. I'm not a fan of writing negative reviews but I think if I came back it'd just be for a drink."}
{"text":"First time in Madison, first time at Merchant.    I liked that they were a true farm-to-table place...food, service, and ambiance were all top notch.  For starters, their bartenders are solid.  I am a gin fan, and opted to roll the dice and let the bartender make something.  He ended up doing a riff on a Last Word and a Negroni called a Bijoux.  It was fantastic.  Food-wise, I went with the warm quinoa and kale salad with a side of cheese curds...both were great.  My server, Trent, said that the curds were a Wisconsin  \"right of passage\".  I am glad I opted to walk, I felt less guilty eating them all....because \"cardio\".  I am planning on hitting this place up again, as there are so many other items that look legit..I will update when I do."}
{"text":"The craft cocktails are absolutely amazing! All made from homemade ingredients, original recipes which gives you plenty of options for tasty drinks. The cocktail menu is one of a kind and is masterfully put together. Their bartenders are the best in town. They have mastered all these drinks and are true bar craftsmen. I would recommend the Regret or Zombie. Both can sneak up on you if you're too busy enjoying the captivating bar ambiance. If you get hungry, their Merchant burger is my favorite burger in town. All natural Wisconsin ingredients and organic. If burger isn't your thing they have plenty of other great options on their menu. The pork pappardelle is excellent!"}
{"text":"We started off with cheese curds--ooh man, get the cheese curds.  People rave about the Old Fashioned having the best cheese curds but gosh, these were perfectly gooey with that good cheese pull when you take your first bite.  Heavenly.  Following this, we took on the Ploughman's board, which had individually good components, but most of them were strong, bold flavors that made it difficult to find good combinations.  Lots of meat and ham, with a smaller size being plenty of food for two people.  The pickled vegetables had a great crunch and tartness that you can tell they were homemade (the carrots were the star of the board for me).    Lastly, we had the moules frites; a nice, big plate of mussels sitting next to a pile of frites, both laying on top of a creamy, lemony broth.  Despite the frites being submerged in this herb-y broth, they still maintained a little bit of a crunch.  Our cocktails were also delicious, as I had started with a pleasantly foamy pisco sour, followed by one of their cocktails called Pears Well With, which was like a pear-infused Moscow Mule. I'll definitely be back for some cocktails and curds!"}
{"text":"Cool looking space, but service sucks. Not just once, but last three times there. Three strikes you're out."}
{"text":"Main stars here are service and drinks.  Our server, Kristin, was top-notch! Very knowledgable and helpful. Great captain for our first sail to cocktail-dom! 5/5  Drinks: so many old school choices with rejuvenating upgrades. 5 drinks - all great! A little heavy on the price and small on the glass size. But it WAS mostly straight up alcohol. Creativity counts for most here. Can't wait to go back for more. 5/5  Ambience: logger long sleeves, brown colors, and candlelight. 5/5  Downfall: the food. Everything on the main entrees has some form of cream sauce. So it's basically pick your protein and lay it on cream sauce, carb vs greenery. This place takes winter serious: heavy food to fill your cold body. I went for the Friday night fish night. I guess I'm just really different from everyone else. I didn't see the highlights. It was fried fish without flavor. The batter itself was a medium heaviness, pinch of salt. There was a decent amount of fish inside the batter, but I couldn't really \"taste\" the fish. So if you need flavor, you have to use lemon or tarter sauce. I was hoping for more creativity. I HAD to use the lemon to give it something, as tartar sets a big problem for my gut. 2/5  The highlight here was the coleslaw, heavy on vinegar, but was perfect for the bland fish. Next time I might just ask for the coleslaw. 4/5  Fries were above average - thin-medium cut (my favorite), nice length, nothing fancy. 4/5  My other got the veggie tagliatelle. She liked it (4/5). But I just felt sad for the mushrooms drowning in that cream sauce. The pasta was good; it's housemade, but again, that cream sauce tried to murder it too. For cream lovers, you'll love it.  Best food: the meat board, charcuterie. With the heavy batter and cream sauce, the idea of dessert was too much. So we went for the meat board! It... was... fantastic! Of course it's Underground Meat company, so, well done on using a great local company. The accompaniments were a great balance with the meats.  Would love to see a place like this figure out a new way to liven up the old idea of Wisco fish fry. Beer batter? Scotch batter? Curry batter? Nut batter? Sample pack Batter? Something in the batter? Or maybe something in the sauces?   I will go back for drinks, and probably that meat board. I just need to eat something else.  So for drinks, I give this place 5/5 For food, I give it 2/5 I'll split the difference with 3.5/5."}
{"text":"This place is great.  The service is amazing and accommodating for all different types of groups-- I've gone here on dates, with coworkers, and even during busy dinner times with a large group including two toddlers and we have always received amazing service.  The food is incredible and locally sourced, and they have the best drink menu in town."}
{"text":"Merchant Madison is good but far from great. I felt strangely underwhelmed and unimpressed by their weekend brunch.   AMBIANCE: The vibe is upscale cocktail bar meets American brunch. Dark space and brick walls were brightened up by fresh florals.   FOOD: I ordered the Merchant Omelet at $11. Basically it was an omelet with kale, with a side of mixed greens and huge roasted potato wedges. I enjoyed the kale in my omelet, and that was the selling factor that pushed me to order this dish. The mixed greens were lightly tossed in balsamic, but it was so faint I couldn't even tell. With the right ingredients, I feel like I can reproduce this dish, which is a carnal restaurant sin in my book.   I also sampled the Steamed Mussels, Cheese Curds, and Hand-Cut Fries. Steamed Mussels were good, but not special. Cheese Curds tasted too buttery for me - I suppose it was the buttermilk ranch, but I felt it was too much. Fries were normal - better with regular ketchup than their malt vinegar aioli.   DRINKS: Their craft cocktail menu and spirits selection is very extensive, which sets them apart. $1 craft cocktails with Yelp check-in. I got to sample a few cocktails, and though I wasn't the biggest fan of all of them, they all tasted unique. My favorite was a cocktail my brother got, which was a lemony mix of IPA beer and liquor. I think it was the Scotch Hopper, but I am not sure. Their cocktails are definitely their unique selling point.   SERVICE: Our server offered our party of 14 the option of separate checks, which I thought was a nice gesture. Usually, large parties have to ask about this, and with larger parties it's typically not even an option due to mandatory gratuity."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in downtown Madison. The inside decor is dark but very inviting. The wall behind the hostess table is flanked with bottles of wine and the bar sits along the back wall.   All of the food is locally sourced and has a new American cuisine vibe - rustic with a lot of flavor. Having been here a number of times, I thought I'd share some of my favorite items. If you're in the mood for an appetizer, the cheese curds are really good. They are lightly breaded and seasoned perfectly. The steak frites are also good. Since their menu changes frequently, I'll usually order the special being offered or go with the tried and true roast chicken or a fresh ground burger. They have a great happy hour, which is the perfect time to get a drink and a bite without the rush of the dinner crowd."}
{"text":"Best place to go for cocktails in Madison. Great atmosphere with amazing company! Love the folks that gather here :)"}
{"text":"We went for brunch and enjoyed the trendy vibe and farm-to-table offerings.  -Very friendly staff. We arrived an hour before our reservation and they were able to accommodate us early. -Atmosphere is bustling and exciting with a great central bar. -They do craft cocktails and non-alcoholic creations as well including homemade sodas. -They specialize in locally sourced ingredients and you can see the list of all the farms and providers they use in the area. -Fried cheese curds were excellent. -Eggs and Omelettes were delicious--with fantastic crunchy potatoes on the side. -Chicken sandwich was awesome. -They also sell many of the wines and beers on premises if you want to take some more with you to go!"}
{"text":"Went to Merchant two nights in a row, first for restaurant week then for my best friend's birthday. The restaurant week menu was expansive compared to others participating in restaurant week. The place was poppin, and our drinks took a little while. Not to worry though, because our waitress treated us to some complementary cava! Exceptional service here.   My friend and I shared everything we ordered, starting with the cheese curds and beef carpaccio. This was my first time having carpaccio, and if you don't now this already it's thin and rare. Barely warmed, but the sprouts pairing made a delish match. We really enjoyed it.   We shared the Pork pappardelle and Salmon for our mains. Can't say enough about the pappardelle, homemade pasta topped with a generous amount of homemade ricotta and ragu sauce. Just sublime. And the portion was generous. The salmon fillet was a little small for the price of the meal, but the meld of crisp apple and maple brought the dish to a level of greatness.   \"Bring on the desserts\" - said no stomach ever after two big courses at restaurant week. We ate it anyways. I got the lemon crema cake with fresh blueberries. Wasn't the highlight of the meal, but gave me an airy angel food-ish finish to the event.  The SECOND night I went to Merchant, I just got cocktails. The bartenders are really mixologists and super talented. If you're overwhelmed by the cocktail selection, just tell them what type of liquor and flavors you like and they'll whip up something personalized.   Reasons why I won't give this place 5 stars: not super gluten free friendly (at least the restaurant week menu wasn't), the bar is super narrow and on a busy Friday night gets a little awkwardly cramped."}
{"text":"The drinks are great. We went here once for a nice dinner and once for going out. Food is overpriced for the quality. It wouldn't be my first choice for something to eat. I had the fried perch and my boyfriend had a pasta. Mine was decent, but his was extremely under-seasoned.   As a place to grab some drinks in the evening, it was great. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time here, and it was just okay...  I was disappointed they only had the brunch menu available and it was almost mid afternoon, so I wasn't looking for what I ended up ordering.  I had the breakfast burrito, and it was okay.  It was more cheddar queso flavor and lacked the spiciness I hopped for.    Service was decent overall.  With that said, I'll consider trying here again at some point."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre and not what I'd expect at that price. Seems like the good reviews are all about the cocktails and not the food."}
{"text":"Brought a friend and his fianc√©e here for a dinner while they were visiting and searching for an apartment and they loved it. Always love the drink selections at Merchant, and the food never disappointments. If you're looking for good cheese - get the Plooughmans cheese board. If you're looking for good burgers, get the merchant burger or the lamb sliders. Atmosphere here is fun, but I would recommend reservations a couple of days in advance. This place fills up fast."}
{"text":"I've been to Merchant twice and both times had very positive experiences. Merchant has absolutely fantastic cocktails, if on the safe side. Their menu includes a selection of classics/pre-prohibition era cocktails as well as a few \"original\" cocktails that leaned toward the safer side of originality. I had the opportunity to try most of the original creations. While the cocktails were well crafted and well balanced, I found them to be...boring (drinks I could make and have easily made at home). If you are new to craft cocktails, Merchant is definitely an excellent place to start out, but I would say that cocktail enthusiasts not get too excited about all the hype.    I will have to say that the food is good. On my first visit we enjoyed the fava bean risotto, toasts, charcuterie plate, dulce de leche, and elderflower panna cotta. All of these dishes were well executed with the risotto having a delightful texture and richness. The charcuterie plate had a nice selection of products including a very classic pate de canard and anise-y rillettes. As other reviewers have stated the toasts are unwieldy but they do have tasty toppings. The desserts here were fantastic and did not suffer from being too sweet.    With cocktails at $9 a pop and smaller dishes running around the same price, Merchant can get a bit pricey for the couple that wants to try a variety of things.   The ambiance is amazing...if you need to get out of Madison/Wisconsin for an evening and go to LA or NYC, Merchant is a beautiful venue that will allow you to save money on a flight out to those cities. I must say that the lighting is fantastic. This is a wonderful environment to have an intimate meal with someone special.   I would definitely recommend Merchant for cocktails and small bites especially for new cocktail enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Feel a little compelled to drop a review on Merchant. One of my favorite places to hang and try different cocktails, there is always a mellow vibe and somewhat addictive atmosphere. However, this Sat went there for a few cocktails after a work function. Great when we got in there but soon after the DJ started. Now I know I'm old, but holy sh1t, was it loud! Don't get me wrong, I can do loud, I'm a 6 year EDC vet, but this was crazy loud (and sorry, the music was not that inspiring) I couldn't even hear the person next to me.   We left after 1 round so by my calculations Merchant is down a solid $300 as we were good for a few more.   Less decibels, more drum and bass and I'm all in!"}
{"text":"It was recommended to me by several coworkers to check out Merchant as part of my quest to find the best cheese curds in Madison, as well as enjoy a tasty cocktail.  The hubs and I went for a later than normal (8pm) dinner on a Friday night.  The place was hopping, but we were seated right away.  Our table was a small raised table at the end of a row close to the kitchen, which being the culinarian that I am, actually enjoyed being able to peer into the kitchen every so often.  However, we were essentially sitting on bar stools and it wasn't the most comfortable for dinner.  We got the menu, massive drink menu and we were off!  I had already perused the menu online because rarely do I go to a restaurant without scoping it out ahead of time, so I had a good idea of what I wanted.  We put in an order of buffalo style cheese curds (per Yelpers suggestion), a Ralph Lee cocktail (one of the few rum based ones), and I ordered the Lamb Sliders.    The buffalo cheese curds were...interesting.  When I go back, I will definitely order them plain because I thought the sauce was just too overwhelming.  It tasted more like buffalo chicken bites because I honestly couldn't taste the cheese portion.  Which made me sad.  And after awhile, eating that much buffalo sauce just overwhelms the palate.  So my recommendation as a cheese curds connoisseur is to skip the buffalo and if you really want, ask for the sauce on the side.  The Ralph Lee cocktail however was divine.  The perfect balance of acidity and sweetness with just enough booze.  I would definitely order again.  The lamb sliders were delicious, have a delightful cherry jam on them and the flavors were well composed.    The dessert selections were a little wanting, or perhaps I just wasn't in the mood for what they had, but I got a cherry chocolate pot de creme essentially.  It was good, but not very cherry-y.  One of my things is if you use it as a flavor descriptor, it should probably taste like that.  No one calls a banana split cherry flavored because it was one maraschino on top.  The hubs's key lime pie was very not pie like and was disappointing, but not terrible.  Also, when we were there, it was VERY loud.  It made it difficult to have a conversation with someone sitting right next to me.  I mean, it was busy, but I feel like it shouldn't have been that loud.  It was also very dark, even more so as the evening went on.  So to sum it up: Service was great, food was good but not foodgasmic, stick to the regular cheese curds, branch out and order an interesting cocktail, go somewhere else for dessert."}
{"text":"Five stars if you're looking for a carefully made craft cocktail. Its not on the menu anymore but ask for a Second Squadron. The menu is limited but the food quality is high. Lose a star if you're looking for food and conversation because it can be really loud inside."}
{"text":"Outside seating area was nice on a beautiful summer evening but it should be treated as a full section - it seemed as though each server had one table out there which lead to a lot of inefficiencies in service. That said - the food was very tasty, we had the ploughmans, salad and cheese curds. Everything was excellent, the salad a tad overdressed and slightly overpriced for what it was. We didn't have any cocktails, but a rather pleasing draft beer and tasty house made cocktail!"}
{"text":"I previously reviewed Merchant in 2011 when they first opened with a 4 star review. While Merchant remained vibrant and energetic with a wonderful drink menu, the food became quite disappointing. Since my original review, I had one of my worst meals in Madison in the summer of 2013 (never reviewed- but never planned on going back).  I did end up returning this past week and was pleased by the improvements.  The renewed focus on food, new chef, updated menu and some updates to the dining room have breathed new life into Merchant.   What keeps this from being a 5-star review is the repeated unpleasant interactions with some staff.   Two specific examples that I hope management can learn from.  1) We had a drink at the bar while waiting for our table. When we were told that our table was ready, we were instructed to settle up before proceeding to our table. It would have been far easier to settle up at the table- as it took another 10 minutes to get a bartender's attention. We attempted to get the attention of the bar back who immediately assumed we were trying to order a drink and said \"I'm a bar back.\" Yes- we understand you are a bar back and can't take drink orders but you can be helpful and a little warmer to customers. And the bar backs reaction might have been marginally more acceptable had it been late at night but we were there for dinner on a tuesday evening.   2) When attempting to pay our dinner bill, we were given a bad pen and couldn't sign our credit card authorization. Again- we had difficulty finding our server or anyone to assist us so we could move on with our evening. We finally got the attention of a host, who was clearly convinced that we were about to try to place an order with her and she was already preparing to walk away until she realized that yes in fact she was capable of solving this small problem.   I hope that staff here can learn how to support one another- as it will yield more positive customer experiences."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times now, once for a brunch event for work and then for the cheap date special on Tuesday night. I think I might have ordered the wrong thing at brunch -- I got the omelet which was fine but nothing too special (if I'd been paying the bill, I probably would have been a bit disappointed to have paid $13 for it) --¬†but a lot of people at the table ordered the breakfast burrito and that looked really yummy. If I come back for brunch some time, I think I'd order that or the fried chicken sandwich.   I was more impressed by the Tuesday date night special -- you get two entrees, two desserts, and a bottle of wine for $40. The entree is usually a creation not offered on the menu and considering dinner entrees average $20 a plate at Merchant, it's a great deal. My partner and I had a reservation for 8pm so by the time we were seated, they'd run out of the Tuesday night special for the evening and the waitress told us we could order any entree of the menu instead (minus the steak). We ordered some fries to start (not included in the $40 but we were hungry) and the server brought a bottle of red. I was expecting it to be pretty ordinary wine considering the price but it was actually a really delicious red. The fries were crisp and yummy too. For the entrees, I ordered salmon and and my partner ordered the pork belly. Both were cooked perfectly and were also the perfect size - I was afraid since it's a fancier place that the entrees would be small and not satisfying but our dishes left us feeling full and very happy, indeed. Not too full that we had to skip out on dessert though! We had some sort of dark chocolate and cherry custard which went well with the wine and was the perfect end to a lovely evening. If you're looking for a delicious and affordable date night option, definitely check out Merchant on Tuesday nights!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. My fianc√© and I stopped in for happy hour on a Friday. We had a number of drinks ranging from menu selections to bartender recommendations. All were fantastic. We also got a cheese curd appetizer that was pretty enjoyable. Loved these ice and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent little place. I was skeptical, but my husband loved his breakfast burrito, my shrimp tacos were un-mazing, and the sides of pork belly were spectacular. The tacos had HUGE shrimp which was tender, sweet, and perfectly prepared. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Sat outside and had a few cocktails while passing through Madison. In addition to being highly entertaining, the cocktail menu has a number of traditional and creative preparations. Our favorite was the Muzzle of Bees, a must try if you like gin-based drinks and one of the better cocktails I've ever had."}
{"text":"Merchant is always great.   Came here for a late brunch yesterday. My boyfriend and i shared the meat/cheese board small plate. This was great!   He had the Merchant omelette with a bloody and I had the chicken fried sandwich. All were great, and recommendable.  We asked the waitress at the end of our meal to box up the meat tray. She was fantastic and gave us extra mustard, jams, honey and Madison Sourdough bread slices! We re-created the board later at home :)."}
{"text":"I came here late at night for music/dancing. Music was good, atmosphere okay and service was the worst I've experienced in my life. Everytime I went up to get a drink it took at least 20 minutes. The worst was when I had been waiting for about 20 minutes when a guy comes next to me is served immediately. When finally the bartender is getting my drink, another guy comes up next to me orders a drink and receives it before I even receive mine. I can't make this stuff up. Worst. Service. Ever."}
{"text":"The cocktails here deserve more than 5 stars  -- they are amazing!  To the food, however, I'd give only 3 stars = so I'm giving the Merchant, as a whole, 4 stars. Still, that shouldn't discourage anyone from coming to this beautiful restaurant.  I spent a summer in Madison and came back to the Merchant multiple times  for their wonderful drinks. Every single person I brought with me was always impressed. The cocktails are creative and wonderfully balanced. There is no question in my mind that the Merchant's cocktails are superior (and a couple dollars cheaper!) to those of bars in NYC and DC that are known for craft cocktails.  I especially loved a new one on their summer menu that is basically a yerba-mate caipirinha. Amazing! The bartenders are also really friendly, and are always willing to suggest the perfect cocktail or wine for you if you are feeling overwhelmed.  However, the food I've ordered at the Merchant has been a mixed bag. The appetizers and cheese platter have been tasty. But when my husband and I came for dinner, we felt the food wasn't really anything to write home about, and was a bit pricey for what you got. For example, I ordered the small plate of mussels, which included about 12 mussels or so. Fine. Except at least 4 of them weren't even opened. Which meant I couldn't eat 1/3 of my order. Someone in the kitchen should have noticed this before plating it, and, frankly, why were so many of them unopened in the first place? The waitress agreed to bring me out a new dish, which was nice, but it was still a bit odd. The sauce the mussels were in was really bland, too. I can't remember what my husband ate for dinner, but he wasn't terribly impressed either.  For desserts, I've had the tres leches cake twice. The first time it was pretty awful, but the second time it was tastier. I should also note, however,  that the St. Louis Butter Cake with Jam was wonderful."}
{"text":"I got the special that was not on the menu and it was fish and chips, and it was reallyyy goood. Light / fresh fish and light batter and the fries were crispy and good too. My friends had the duck and the mussels, both of which were great too. We shared the ploughman... charcuterie board thing... and lucky for us the waiter accidentally brought out the basic cheese board and just brought us another full board with the cured meats. For it's price though, there was very little cheese. I love their large cocktail menu ( I like the more citrusy/fresh ones) and their drinks are indeed tasty. Great decor, love that their walls are covered with bottles of wine.We made a reservation, so I dont know what it's like to just walk in."}
{"text":"A little pricey, but in my experience this place has some of the best food and drinks in Madison.  Also slightly less formal than some other places, which I really appreciate.  Their bartenders are second-to-none, and when I told my waiter that my cocktail wasn't quite what I was expecting they made me a new one, no questions asked.  This is a great place to bring visiting friends or parents, or just to hang out and have a few drinks.  I've been here half a dozen times, and I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Moco loco burger is the BEST SAVORY burger in town! But caution folks, just one per two weeks or even a month is more than enough...!!!!!  This crazy place about local food even makes its own house burrata!! If you haven't tried it (OMG WHY NOT!), its this awesome creamy cheese that lets you spread it over whatever you want. I mean, I like the Italian original at Osteria better, but hey, this is probably as good as local gets!  Pastas are always good here too. It's more American Italian, but at least ingredients and flavors are awesome!  Drinks are always good!!! Anything with an egg white is DELICIOUS!!   I'm not sure I like the atmosphere after 10:30pm on Fridays and Saturdays.. It's more like a club. Very loud music and you have to stand around. Definitely not where I would go to chill out with friends and chat.. But hey, maybe that's your scene.  Always packed on weekends during dinner. so make a reservation! AND it's on open table too!  Also, look out for the daily specials! Mondays you get burger specials with beer, Tuesdays date night... And other special events ;)"}
{"text":"I finally made it here, after hearing good things for a while.  I met my 2 girlfriends around 7:30 for an 8:00 reservation on a Saturday night.  We got cocktails at the bar, my 2 friends told the bartender what they were in the mood for and their likes/dislikes, and he came back with 2 cocktails for them.  I'm not a cocktail person, but was told to get the Handsome Devils since I'm a whiskey drinker.  It wasn't on the menu but the bartender made it no problem.  We all enjoyed our cocktails and brought them with us to our table.    The hostess and server and other waitstaff were all great.  We started with 2 appetizers, Pommes Frites and Classic Cheese Curds.  I have to say, they are some of the best cheese curds I've ever had.  Light, great breading, tasty and gooey.  Perfect.  The sauce with the frites was addicting too.  My friend and I then split both the Mussels and the Classic Burger (w/ muenster and bacon), our other friend had the Pork Pappardelle.  The burger was amazing and cooked to perfection.  I enjoyed the Mussels though wished it was easier to get to the broth at the bottom of the dish.  We all couldn't handle how delicious our food was.  My only complaint would be how quickly the staff was ready to take our plates away, even with some food left without asking if we wanted boxes.  I didn't catch it in time but my fries left from my burger were gone in the blink of an eye.  Other than that, it was such a great meal.  I will definitely eat here again,  Amazing food and decent cocktail and beer selection.  A great place for girl's night or date night. :)"}
{"text":"Merchant is a restaurant/bar with fancy internal decor and outdoor seating in the spring and summer months. I went there for brunch and was extremely impressed with what I got: eggs benedict and this chocolate/cherry custard thing.   The restaurant is best experienced if you like drinking alcoholic beverages. I don't, so all I had was iced tea, and I couldn't enjoy a lot of the stuff behind the bar. (They have all these liquor bottles lined up horizontally in 1930s gangster movie fashion.) The drink menu is evidently famous: a multi-page flip-through booklet with many complicated drinks that certain consumers try to replicate themselves. NOTE: even though my teetolater (sp) ways affected how much I could enjoy Merchant, it did NOT affect how much I rated it here, so relax.  At ANOTHER restaurant, I had a pretty horrible eggs benedict a week ago with sauce that was pretty bland and hopeless. The sauce is the make or break, and it was incredible here. Fellow diners were envious, too, over my cherry/chocolate custard dessert, which I almost didn't order until I saw people make a fuss over it when another table got it, and I walked over to confirm \"visually.\"   So why a star off? Cheese curds were mediocre and inconsistent. Overly salted, and one plate arrived with yellow cheddar (preferred) and another with white cheddar (non-preferred). This makes it hard to know whether you'll want cheese curds if you have strong yellow/white curd views like me.  Bonus: if you love to buy liquor, there's a \"bourgeois\" liquor store attached to Merchant. Photos attached. Great if you're a \"dinner's over, but the party's just beginning...\" type. Overall, I recommend Merchant highly!!!!"}
{"text":"During our recent visit to Madison, WI we decided to meet up with some friends. Merchant came highly recommended for their craft cocktails and \"farm to table\" menu. The inside was pretty packed and chaotic, made even more claustrophobic by large shelves of varying wine and liquor for sale.  Their cocktail menu is vast and can get a bit overwhelming so start by narrowing it down to the type of poison you'd like to imbibe on that particular evening. I chose gin; I wanted something lighter and refreshing. My cocktail was \"Aviation\" - Gin, Lemon Juice, Luxardo Maraschino, Creme de violette--Served Up \"Regarded as the prince of cocktails. A very bright cocktail with floral and gin botanical notes\" $10 It was potent enough so after two I was feeling a nice buzz without feeling loopy.  For dinner we opted for Buttermilk Salad ($8) off their \"small plates\" portion of the menu. It really was very delicious and fresh. The salad was described as \"Vitruvian Farm field greens, heirloom carrot, radish, Roth Kase blue cheese, house-made buttermilk ranch*. Our  \"large plate\" option consisted of Braised Pork Belly ($22) - \"Marr's Valley View Farms' bacon & Alsum sweet corn fritters, Elderberry Hill Farm's red frilly mustards with  house-made tomato jam.\" The pork belly was cooked perfectly and everything on the plate with it was extremely tasty and well prepared balanced to perfection.   The dud of the evening was Beef Carpaccio ($11) - \"shaved tenderloin, kale, kuri squash, roasted shiitake, pickled mustard seed, SarVecchio tuile, black garlic vinaigrette.\" It sounds a lot better than it tasted. I found it bland and chose to indulge in the salad over this dish.  Overall, the quality and freshness of the ingredients was apparent and made for a unique dining experience. For those planning a visit, or residing in the area they do have Happy Hour 3-6pm every day featuring $2 off Classic Cocktails, Drafts, and Lawnmower Beers.  I would highly recommend giving this place a try. Grab a craft cocktail and an item off the \"snacks\" or \"small plates\" portion of the menu and enjoy!"}
{"text":"If Merchants were in Los Angeles, I'd probably eat here every single day... I mean, nothing gets better than good, solid, affordable food made by locally farmed produce! Not to mention, the portion sizes are HUGE and the food came out so quickly! For starters, our group got the cheese curds (DUH! We're in Wisconsin for CHEEEEESE obviously) and these were amazing!!! In addition, we got the maple syrup garlic bread brick toast (also including CHEEEESE), which was such an amazing mix of sweet and savory, all baked together on a fluffy tall brick toast. Per the waitress' recommendation, we also ordered the crispy pork belly pizza, topped with arugula and CHEESE! Ahh nothing gets better than some good ol pork belly! All I wanted to do was to get that pork belly in my own bellllaaaay.   Anyways, before I get too excited... I have to mention the entrees. I got the foie gras burger with onions and bleu cheese and had a side of some sort of squash soup as well. This is where the restaurant faltered a little bit. The burger was humongous- a double patty, foie gras + sirloin burger.... bigger than my face!!! The meat patties, themselves, were nice and juicy. However, the onions tasted too much like red wine and together with the excessive amount of bleu CHEEESE (do you see a trend here?) added, I kinda lost the taste of the foie + meat. :( In addition, i wasn't too fond of the soup here... but that's just because I'm not a squash/pumpkin type of girl (one too many pumpkin pie eating contests in 6th grade lead to a fear of all squashes)  But, not to worry, the other entrees (I hear) were truly amazing. Almost everyone else got the Chicken Under a Brick, which was a hugeeeee slab of chicken with spinach on the bottom, in a cream sauce.   Even though I was almost unbearably full, the host of the dinner party insisted on getting dessert. I chose the cherry cobbler with ice cream and MY GOD, this was heavenly. The cobbler was too sweet by itself, but together with the ice cream, they played the perfect pas de deux in my mouth. So good. Apparently the other desserts that my group tried were quite lovely as well (dark chocolate mousse)... but I didn't get to try any so I'm just going to continue raving about my cobbler. DID I SAY HOW GOOD IT WAS???  Anyways, Merchants was a fantastic place for someone who had never been to Wisconsin before (AKA MEEEEEE!). It was so cool to read where each ingredient came from and have this true farm to table experience. The prices were so reasonable (I guess I'm just used to the obnoxious prices of LA restaurants) and the service was so friendly (maybe its just a Midwest thing)...   To conclude, I LOVE MERCHANTS despite their few flaws... and I would definitely go back and eat there on a heartbeat!  4.5 stars!"}

{"text":"This last summer when my son came to visit me, we decided to go for a \"happy hour\" in the city. He had previously been to Merchant and we went. We ordered several appetizers and Cocktails. The Ambiance was disturbed by the very loud music. Since we were the only ones in the bar that time we asked him to turn it down and they gladly did. The appetizers were excellent, the cocktails made well and we were able to sit and talk while we enjoyed both. They are definitely recommended for happy hour."}
{"text":"Merchant has been on the list to try for a while, and with an enticing brunch menu for Mother's Day we figured this was the day to do it! There are limited reservations accepted but we only had to wait 10 minutes for a table at 10:45. They were clear in their direction that we had to leave the table by 12:45 for an incoming reservation which wasn't a problem - but how that system works out every time without incident is beyond me! Overall, I'll be back as I'd like to try the dinner menu but I wasn't greatly impressed this time around. After being seated it took at least 10 minutes for our server to make her way to our table. They were out of the mixture for one of the mocktails which disappointed the kiddos but they made up for it with fun glasses and straws to serve their second choices with. Once we were able to order the food came promptly, but I was really disappointed at the temperature of the breakfast burrito. Maybe lukewarm to warm in spots? Good flavor, though that \"cheddar queso\" being code for pre-made cheese sauce wouldn't shock me. My husband's omelet was excellent and he also really liked the Scotch eggs we ordered (though I think that's  mainly to do with his obsession over pickled onions). The eggs were good, but I missed the smoked sausage that the menu indicated in the dish. Loved the cornichons, capers, mustards, and pickled onions that accompanied. The kids raved over their brioche French toast, pleased that it wasn't fried to a point where it was hard to bite into it. I heard the potatoes were seasoned well also.  The service (after the slow start) was friendly and the cocktail menu is absolutely outstanding. Again, I hope to update this review with another experience soon."}
{"text":"This was the first place I wanted to dine when we got to Madison, and it was GREAT!  It's loud and a little hipster-ish (we were seated inches away from a blonde waif who continually pulled on her e-cigarette), but worth it.  Cocktails of all makes and models (I went with the French 75), great stories and names.  Cheese curds were tasty and not greasy, something I find they are too often.  I had the duck breast and it was perfect.  My friend thought her pasta was just okay (she'd dined here multiple times and found this disappointing compared to her previous entrees).  Check it out."}
{"text":"This review is based entirely on Merchant as a restaurant - I have never gone specifically for the bar, though I have gone three times for lunch.  I was very underwhelmed each time.  The portions are very small.  The entree salads are barely the size of a side salad.  Fortunately, if you ask for bread, they will (in my experience), give you a slice of bread free - a good thing, because otherwise I would have needed to stop at Subway afterwards just so I wouldn't still be starving.  The sandwiches are ok, nothing special, and also seemed small and not filling.  Service is slow, and servers are completely unknwledgeable.  They don't even know without asking the chef whether the soup of the day is vegetarian!  Everytime I have gone, they were out of some main item on the menu - which seems crazy, because the menu is tiny - how hard can it be to keep the ingredients for 5 paninis and 4 salads in stock???  ** After posting the above, admittedly negative, review, the restaurant contacted me and informed me that they are in the process of revamping their lunch menu and service to address some of the issues I mentioned.  For the sake of giving a new, local restaurant a chance, I'm temporarily changing my review to 3 stars based on the restaurant's responsiveness to a dissatisfied customer, and I will repost after I have a chance to try lunch at Merchant again in a few weeks."}
{"text":"The menu is pricey (although they do have reasonably priced sandwich items) but amazing. The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable about the items on the menu. The salmon tartar was beyond compare and I have dreams about my beef tenderloin. Fiance said he liked his food as well. Drinks were unique, tasty and strong. My only gripe is that at about 10 pm on a Saturday, a DJ set up and it got very loud in there. Thankfully we were near the end of our meal. Next time we'll get there earlier.  Ambiance and decor is beautiful. Brunch menu looks great - we're going to check it out soon!"}
{"text":"Amazing gastropub and late night bar. Craft cocktails and some of the best food in town in its class.   The service is great. Atmosphere is loud, but not unpleasant. The food is amazing. The menu changes occasionally, but I have never had a dish I did not like."}
{"text":"I'm a regular. The cocktail and beer happy hour have never disappointed. My fastball order is a rye Manhattan and cheese curds.   The make an excellent burger. The mussels with frites are great. The charcuterie board is good. I've never been disappointed in a meal here and the staff are second to none.   Late night on weekends can be loud and its a high energy atmosphere. The early evening is chill with great music and the occasional jeopardy on tv.    This place is also known for its patrons booing Scott Walker out the door.   Merchant is a great neighborhood bar attached to a top notch restaurant.    Ask for a cocktail recommendation and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Warning: This is going to be a very short review and I will update it when I return to try more things!  A girlfriend and I stopped here for some after dinner drinks on a Friday night. The place was packed, which was to be expected. We squeezed into a spot at the bar and were quickly attended to by a bartender. Before I get into the drinks and food, this place is so cool. I always thought it looked cool from the outside but it's even cooler than I expected. And the bartenders are so awesome! They're all super nice and so incredibly knowledgeable about what they do. What an impressive place.  Back to the review. We ordered a few drinks, my friend ordered a Whiskey Sour and I ordered whatever the bartender felt like making me. He ended up making me something with tequila in it and a bunch of other ingredients that I didn't know but it was delicious! So delicious that we decided to stay for another. This time I tried an Amaretto Sour and oh my god. How have I never been here before....it was out of this world good. I'd be religious to this place just for that drink. We also ordered cheese curds because why not and they were divine. Super ooey gooey with just the right amount of breading and fried to perfection. Yumm.   Like I said, I plan to return to try their food and will update when I do!"}
{"text":"Some of the best craft cocktails in Madison. Their food menu is okay, but I would go there for cocktails and then head someplace else for dinner. The bartenders are friendly and are great with offering suggested drinks. It can get rather crowded on Friday and Saturday night so be prepared for a wait to get a seat. Would recommend if you are looking to meet up for a drink."}
{"text":"It's a craft cocktail bar so you will pay more than you want for a cocktail but they taste so good. The bartenders were all very friendly and the people I was with thought Merchant was the highlight of the day."}
{"text":"Okay, forget everything I said about Nostrano or Graze . . . when it comes to \"farm-to-table\" dining in Madison, Merchant is the real deal. Not to downplay Nostrano's rustic offerings or Graze's hearty Americana, but Merchant's menu is more creative and flavorful than anything the other two could hope to offer.  We managed to pass up the compelling list of cocktails (hope to return soon to sample those), and started with Mussels with Olives and Fennel. This was served with grilled bread and a salty broth, perfect for dipping. Mussels were amazingly fresh for Madison, but I would have preferred the olives whole instead of chopped up (though this is a nit to be picked). My entree was a thick bone-in roasted pork chop, served with gnocchi (perfectly cooked), spring vegetables and (interestingly) figs. Nothing to complain about here, the pork was very moist (served medium-rate) and all the ingredients meshed beautifully. The star of the evening, though, was Kristine's pan-seared salmon with roasted vegetables. K claimed it was the best salmon she's had (and that includes Seattle!) and after sampling some I had to reluctantly concur. How they were able to sear the meat yet cook it through so tenderly is beyond me.   Once again, though, what saves this from a perfect five stars was the service. I can't blame our waitress, who thoroughly explained the menu's offerings with a confident level of knowledge. This time the fault is with management . . . a large table of 15 was seated near us and proceeded to monopolize our waitress's attention to the point where we had to put her \"on the clock\" as we waited for our check. Management should have been aware of the demands of this large group and placed at least one additional waitron to help out.  A unique circumstance to be sure, and it won't keep us from coming back, but it did prevent this from being a five-star experience."}
{"text":"Really delicious food and cocktails. Our waitress was great too! If I lived here I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Madison for a couple of days and I was blown away by how great this place was.   The food quality, taste, and presentation were amazing! The signature cocktails were very impressive. The service was excellent. The atmosphere/decor were very nice.  Our server, Megan, was awesome, friendly, professional, knowledgeable, and made our time there really special. We loved our brunch so much that we came back at night for dinner and she was our server both times!   If I really had to complain about one thing, one of the bartenders at night (guy wearing a dinosaur costume) was kind of rude to me and charged me the wrong price for a drink. Eh, they were busy.   I will definitely visit again, everything was beyond my expectations. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The bar was a little slow and our waitress got us some champagne until our cocktails arrived. The lamb sliders were great and I didn't dare get close to my wife's mussels dish... would have lost a finger. Very good. Have been here for cocktails, brunch and now dinner. It is all very good!"}
{"text":"This place I very hit and miss. Sometimes it is good, and other times it is poor. Service and food alike. Looking for more consistency and better service. May try again this winter when the staff turns over again."}
{"text":"Nice menu. Great location. That's why the two stars.  Once again, terrible service.  Have been here 5-6 times in the past five years. Only once was service any good. Bartenders look past you. Today three of us we were seated, waited eighteen minutes, and no server stopped by. If it were crowded would have been patient. Didn't even notice when we left. Typical Merchant. Everyone commented They simply don't seem to even care. Poorly managed.   Went across street to Great Dane. Friendly. Great service. Good food. Guess we should have come here first."}
{"text":"The pork pappardelle was really good, but the cheese curds were mindblowing! Great ambiance and very cool interior. Very friendly staff. Great for a date night or out with friends."}
{"text":"I love Merchant and everything it's about. I've been here 5 or 6 times in the last year.   Epic craft cocktails. Farm to table. Liquor store. DJ'S ON THE DELI COUNTER. This place gets poppin' after 10:30, so try not to spill that classy drink.   So why 4 stars? I really love this place and with the small menu and prices, I have really high expectations for the food. I still haven't found an item that I would specifically come back for, and that's the reason I gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"They have a great drink menu here.  I had a Maker's old fashioned (my favorite) and it was made perfectly and the right way.  No \"sweet or sour\" here (sweet and/or sour is not an old fashioned by the way).  This bar is a little expensive but you are getting a quality drink so I think it's worth it.  There was a live DJ on the night that I was there so it was really loud.  Be prepared for that.  All in all this is a pretty fun bar with great drinks."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had drinks and dinner.  Service was fantastic and friendly, even though they were quite busy.  Cheese plate was amazing (and all local!), I took a chance and told the bartender to 'make me something'...and he suggested and made a wonderful cocktail from their menu that I might not have ordered on my own, but was perfect for me.   The entrees did not disappoint...friendly down-town vibe.  We will return."}
{"text":"Came in with jetlag and a craving for cheesecurds. Cheesecurds here are excellent. But then this place is so much more than that...  Cosy and trendy at the same time. Great food (omg the Brussels Sprouts are ridiculously good (ordered without bacon, as am veggie) as is the housemade ricotta and warm olive dish.   The Pisco Sour was definitely not necessary with the jetlag, but I had one anyway. Delicious. ;)"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews about the \"subpar service\" I was a little hesitant to stop by, but honestly, I can't say anything but positive things about our dinner last night and our brunch there this morning.  We visited Madison this weekend for the Madison half marathon. We stopped by for dinner on Saturday, without a reservation. We added our name to the list and the host sat us in less than 15 minutes. Our server was Lauren and she was super friendly; with our water and silverware, she brought a bowl of water out for our dog, Watson, who was very grateful. It was late in the afternoon/evening but there was no judgement passed when I ordered a Bloody Mary, which came not only delicious but very beautifully decorated with a pickle/fresh cheese curd garnish. How do you know when cheese curds are fresh? They squeak!! I can't remember which cocktail Mike got but it had tequila and jalape√±o and was just marvelous, with the perfect amount of heat.  We ordered the pork pappardelle and the muscles with fries; we decided to share our plates with one another because that's the best part of having someone eat with you, right?? The ricotta on the pasta was so fresh, I almost didn't want to share the plate with my company. The muscles came with a creamy wine sauce that we couldn't get enough of. On both plates, a piece of bread would have been nice to soak up the sauces, but without it, it was still delightful.   We made reservations for brunch at 11 on Sunday thinking the race would take longer, but arrived an hour and a half early at 9:30. The host was really nice about it, and since we had our dog we really wanted to sit outside. But, it was pouring rain and we didn't want to eat without him. The staff went out of the way and  gracefully put two umbrellas together, wiped down some tables and chairs for us, and brought Watson some water. I can't recall the last time I went to a restaurant and had staff go above and beyond to take care of us and the dog (especially because it is raining today!!!).   Our server, Justine, was amazing. Even though it was raining she took the time to greet us and make sure we were comfortable. She gave great recommendations for brunch, including the eggs Benedict (which were AHHHHMAZING) and the biscuits and gravy ( which were also very tasty). We ordered a Bloody Mary, some coffee, beer and the Merchant Mimosa. It's not really brunch if you don't have a ton of alcohol and drinks on the table (AMIRIGHT???) Overall, we were very pleased with our meal.   I did read some reviews where people weren't impressed with the price point. To us, this was no different than eating back home in Milwaukee and it was significantly cheaper than some meals we've had in Chicago. Madison isn't a big city, I get it, but it was nice to find a place with fresh farm to table food and craft cocktails, with friendly service. It is definitely one of a kind in Madison, and hopefully the first of many new dining concepts in the city.   Thank you guys for such an amazing time! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Octopus Salad was way too spicy: I couldn't even taste any component of it other than the jalape√±os. I love spicy food but not when it overpowers every other flavor. My friend didn't even want to finish her pasta and the food here did not really meet my expectations. To be fair, they were pretty high, but not unreasonable given the atmosphere and pricing.  Burger was great though, cooked to the exact consistency I asked and served on artisan bread with a magical secret sauce. Memorably juicy meat served on the perfect loaf.   I also had the first truly great whiskey I've ever tried here. It was so powerful that you had to drink it a drop at a time, savoring the wonderful warm burn and scent it left on your tongue.  The craft beer selection was also decent.  So, as strange as it seems given Merchant's outward appearance as a haute-cuisine upper-class establishment, I strictly recommend coming here for a drink and a burger."}
{"text":"Fairly pleasant experience here. Went with clients and had a nice evening. Cocktails were very good as others had mentioned. Food was rather good, I did the salmon. I am not so sure I agree with the lentils as a  side pairing. My fish was perfectly cooked however, but a bit light on seasoning to really bring out the flavor. One of my colleagues ordered the brick chicken and was a bit underwhelmed. Not complaining at all simply justifying my rating. Overall though it was a good experience."}
{"text":"7/11/13 Wife and I biked downtown and visited the Merchant.  She's been raving about their shrimp po'boy sandwich and I discovered for good reason!  It was great.  It came with salad and chips.  We substituted the chips for fries.  We also enjoyed a couple pints of Bedlam by Ale Asylum."}
{"text":"Final stop for Restaurant Week. We ended on a good note.   Located right opposite the Pickney garage   So it was very convenient to get to. Small outside area if you want to eat out.   We were seated promptly. We were early and the first host said we had to wait as our table was occupied. A second hostess (more senior) said no we don't have to. She swapped tables and we got seated right away. That's efficiency!  With the sun shinning in, the inside looks dark and so it gives you a feeling you are by yourself even though there is a table right next to you.   Lots of choices on the RW menu. More than the others we were at early this week.   Course 1 - I had the beef carpaccio and my partner had the housemade ricotta. My carpaccio had water cress which tasted super bitter to both of us. I like her ricotta dish better.   Course 2 - I had the stuffed quail and she had the seated rockfish. Both were really good. My partner said this was the best of the 3 places we tried this week. The portion of the rock fish is small.   Course 3 - I had the dark chocolate cherry custard and she had the berry panna cotta. The texture of the panna cotta is fantastic! So smooth. The custard was also good. Since i don't have a sweet tooth, I found these just right for me.   The one thing I did not get here is their cocktails. Nothing on their menu grabs me like the other two places."}
{"text":"Not quite sure how I feel about this place.   I've only been here for their club nights, so I can't offer anything about the food or anything.  The drinks were pretty standard Madison stuff, nothing too out of the ordinary.  The times I've been here were either hit or miss. There are times when I've been here and it's been absolutely crowded, and then returned a week after, only to find this place completely empty.  And the music selection is usually geared towards an older crowd, even though most people who frequent (at least during late nights) are younger peeps.   I'll still come back once in a while, but this won't be my go-to spot when it comes to a Friday or Saturday night."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by stating we were just here for drinks.  We did not eat here.  I didn't even look at a menu.  What I can tell you, is that they have outstanding libations, an excellent bar-staff and a cozy, warm atmosphere.  We had read about an outstanding milk-punch at Merchant and several of us wanted to try it.  There were no tables available, but when we let the hostess know we just wanted to sit at the bar we were let right in.  The bartenders were excellent.  Friendly, knowledgeable, great service.  We chatted with two of them at different times and you could tell they took pride in both the beverages they served and the ingredients they created them with.  The drink menu is impressive.  Not just the contents but the design of the menu as well.  Cloth, hard backing, wood binding and it is filled with blurbs regarding each cocktail.  Our group of four tried several craft cocktails and beers and we were impressed with all of them.  Depths of flavor and finish, nuanced and subtle undertones in the cocktails.  Just watching the bar crew prepare them was fun.  If you go, be sure and try the moloko punch for something different and tasty.  We'll definitely go back for more of their concoctions!"}
{"text":"I had a decent time at Merchant, but I was pretty underwhelmed by the menu. Maybe I'm not cultured enough to appreciate it fully, but I had a pretty hard time figuring out what to get.   However, as far as ambience and decor are concerned, this place is the bee's knees.   I went with the Merchant Burger. I thought it was a little small for the price, and overcooked.   All things said and done, 3/5 seems appropriate."}
{"text":"Was in Madison for a weekend and wanted to top it off with brunch at a place that used to be one of my favorites.   Couldn't get past the hostess, who could barely look up from her coffee and who wanted to sit us at an odd corner table seated on top of another couple despite the restaurant being empty. Her excuse - we have reservations. Guess what, I was one of them and she knew that.  Walked over to Grave and got seated in minutes by a smiling attentive hostess. Sorry, Merchant but you may need to get over yourself a bit."}
{"text":"For a bar/restaurant, the food is quite delicious!  We also had a martini which was excellent.  My wife and I shared our dishes: pork pappardelle and steak frites and neither of us was disappointed.  Very nice establishment (even though we had to sit on stools).  Recommended!!"}
{"text":"We went here for their Sunday brunch, yesterday, and it was great! The bartenders were fun, friendly and made us great drinks! Friendly staff, overall! Can't wait to go back for their Side Car cocktail!"}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time on my birthday, which wasn't actually planned. The place I originally intended to go to had NO parking, so I was totally lost on where to go. Then I remembered Merchant as I'd passed by it countless times. My husband and I got there and it was packed, but that's to be expected on a Friday night anywhere in Madison. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait and headed to the bar. I had a drink, which doesn't seem to be on their online menu anymore, and damn it, I cannot for the life of me remember the name. It consisted of gin, champagne, absinthe, and a cucumber-mint syrup. Very tasty, though the cucumber-mint syrup was very subtle, I would've liked for it to have stood out more. Our wait ended being closer to 15 minutes, which was nice, as I was half anticipating an even longer wait because of the crowd.    Our server was named Cecilia and she was extremely helpful and informative about the menu and answered any questions we had. To start off we ordered some Sassy Cow cheese curds with buttermilk ranch which was made in house. They were awesome, I'm really picky about cheese curds and the ranch was great. I also ordered a cup of cauliflower soup which came with a slice of thick toast. It was really good for just being toast, not sure if they also made it in house or sourced it from a local bakery. The soup itself was good, I spent most of the time trying to figure out what spices were in it, as it reminded me of Indian food. For entrees I ordered the grilled pork loin, which consisted of Fox Valley Berkshire pork, roasted fingerling potatoes, broccoli and garlic, sherry whole grain dijon vinaigrette (totally copied that part off the menu, ha!). The pork loin was cooked perfectly and incredibly moist. If I had to make any complaint about the dish, it was a little heavy on the pepper, but I was still very pleased. I also had a High Violet to drink along with my dinner, and honestly, I don't remember everything in it, but I believe there was vodka, star fruit, and strawberries. My husband, being the burger guy he is, got the Classic Burger which consisted of house-ground sirloin/short-rib patty with aioli on a brioche bun with side of lettuce, pickles, onion, fresh tomato. You can also add cheese, bacon, or a fried egg for $1 each and he added all three. WOW, that burger was ridiculous...I almost regretted ordering my entr√©e when he let me have a taste. He topped that off with some Ale Alysum Hopalicious. Because it was my birthday, Cecilia was kind enough to offer me a dessert. I chose the gelato, because I had no idea what to choose. The flavor, which varies, was a salted caramel gelato with dark chocolate shavings. It was the perfect ending to our dinner, and I truly felt like a glutton by the time we were out of there.   Overall, the experience was very pleasant and I would gladly go back again. I'm eyeing the cheap date night they have on Tuesdays. The drinks were  a little pricey, $9 and $11. but it wasn't too bad considering the quality. I will definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This review isn't for the restaurant per se but for the happy hour. The drink selection is very extension with a couple neat drinks.  The brunch menu was quite underwhelming especially for the price. You can definitely get better for cheaper."}
{"text":"I have nothing but great things to say about Merchant! Not only are the food and drinks amazing, but they are super accommodating and do everything they can to make sure you have a great experience at the restaurant. I made reservations here for restaurant week with a large group of 7 people. After we got there, they ended up having a small kitchen fire (nothing serious, they opened back up the next day), and we had to evacuate. Not only did they comp the drinks we had already had that night, but THEY called ME to see if they could reschedule our reservation for the next week, and they would still give us the restaurant week deal! The food was definitely worth the wait. I had the Steak Frites and the steak was perfectly cooked medium rare, and the fries were crispy. It also came with a side salad that was very fresh with the perfect amount of dressing. I think this is a great restaurant to come for a fancy, delicious meal, cool ambiance and creative, handcrafted drinks. This was my third time eating here and not once have I been disappointed. Thank you Merchant!"}
{"text":"Merchant truly makes the most interesting and best craft cocktails in Madison. Their cocktail bible is chock full of clever names and weird descriptions to go along with their drinks. They always have a couple pages of seasonal specials, where you will find drinks mixed with homemade shrubs and syrups made with local ingredients. Where else are you going to find corn-raspberry-rhubarb syrup mixed in your drink? I got something last night with multiple gins and yellow chartreuse. Most cocktails will run you $9-12 but they're almost always delicious. I did have one chai-inspired drink in February which came with sweetened cinnamon whipped cream and separating cream isn't a great look on a cocktail. But 9 times out of 10 I am totally pleased.  They have specials each night of the week, like a burger + beer on Mondays for $13 and Fish Fry Fridays. Their Thursday nights with live music could use some work. Don't get me wrong, I am a musician and I love music. But The Merchant is a rather small restaurant, so having volume levels to a point where you cannot hear what your friend is saying while you're inches away from each other and shouting is unpleasant, to say the least. Maybe it's changed since I last experienced that, but I just avoid the restaurant completely on Thursdays.  That said, Merchant also makes delicious food. They cook their steaks perfectly, cheese curds are so yummy with excellent batter, their pasta is made in house, I adore their frites, and they just nail their desserts. Try any creme brul√©e if they have one on the menu. Last night, my friend and I shared the s'mores ice cream dessert which had graham cracker and marshmallow ice creams, a Valrhona chocolate sauce, and a brul√©ed marshmallow. This was insanely good.  Not a cheap place, but definitely worthwhile. Try to go earlier to avoid the young Epic crowd ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing whiskey, amazing beer. Right next to Majestic, absolute tour highlight"}
{"text":"great locally sourced menu.  The food was tasty and the cocktail selection was really cool.  They like mixed drinks here and they make them strong. Had the fried chicken and biscuits with st louis slab cake for dessert.  Yummy!   I really likes the feel of the place, very relaxed and groovy.  I will be returning and recommending this place"}
{"text":"Went for lunch.  Had great,attentive service.  Got the artichoke sandwich and found it to be so-so.  Just not a lot of stuff on it - mostly bread. Monty's Blue Plate Diner has far superior artichoke sandwich. I really enjoyed the coleslaw side though.  My friend had the cubano sandwich and said it was good.  Waiter explained it was made of pig jowls so it's leaner. The description kind of grossed me out, but I was pleased that he was so knowledgeable about the menu.  I'm hoping to try it again sometime for dinner and cocktails. Overall, lunch didn't impress me but there was nothing specifically wrong with it either."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure how I feel about this restaurant. I've been here for dinner in the past and loved it. However, my brunch experience was a bit of a disappointment. The seating outdoors was very pleasant, and the staff was great. Yet, when I got my food, I was given my eggs, potatoes, toast and fruit... All without ketchup, butter, jam, salt or pepper (aka everything necessary to have a bite to my liking.) Once I finally was given my condiments, the excitement to eat this wonderful meal was spoiled due to the fact all my food had gotten cold! So I'm sorry to say my brunch wasn't all that great, but if you try it out, I hope your food isn't cold and you don't have to wait an additional 10 minutes to eat it once your food has been made and the plate has been delivered. Good luck."}
{"text":"Had dinner for the first time at Merchant during Restaurant Week. My date ordered cheese curds and I had the brown sugar bacon brussels sprouts. The cheese curds are fried in a light crisp batter, which makes them awesome. Even the buttermilk ranch they make tastes better than others. The brussels sprouts had the perfect crunch, and I enjoyed the contrast of the bacon and brown sugar. For our entree I ordered the baseball cut NY strip steak, medium rare. The steak had a peppered seasoning and was cooked to my liking. Fries were good and so was the light arugula salad. I was most impressed with my friend's pork shank entree. The pork shank was incredibly tender. It just melted in your mouth. You could tell the flavor absorbed well into the meat because every bite you had was full of flavor. For dessert we both ordered the bread pudding and that was tasty too. I enjoyed the nutmeg and sea salt flavors. I will be coming back during Restaurant week again for their lunch items!"}
{"text":"Very dark. And kind of close awkward seating. Which is less of an issue than the price and quality. With the exception of the cocktails which are amazing and only moderately overpriced... everything else is pretty meh. If the food was 20-40% less this would be an easy 4 Star place. But it's not. 21$ for corned beef and cabbage on St Pats day better be amazing. It was not. It was about 2\" thick and very tough. Perhaps that's \"authentic\" but I was expecting something much different. Like the other 20 dishes of corned beef and cabbage I've had in my life... And one of my biggest pet peeves - one person brought water, one person took our order, a different 3rd person brought the food over, a forth person took my card and brought a box... soooo, who exactly am I tipping? And for what?! Certainly not the engaging discussion or personality. To top it off, the hostess mentioned we were still in on happy hour. Which equates to 2$ off a drink or 8$ for our stay. Hardly complaint worthy, but didn't get it, and by that time we just wanted to leave. So my 8$ worth of advice? Maybe try some of the nearly infinite other dining options Madison has to offer. Or maybe sit at the not-as-awkward bar and have a cocktail. Which range from 9-13$ ish for the most part. Unless of course you manage to find someone that knows it's Happy Hour. But again, 2$ X 4 isn't what let me down... it's the food and the service, and the incredibly awkward seating.   Parting thought: when squeezing my average 6' 200lb mass out of a space that hardly accepts my 36\" waist, do I drag my \"front\" or my \"rear\" across the top of the table next to ours? Well I guess, I we interacted with our dining partners considerably more than the staff, perhaps that makes us close enough for a \"front\" side table drag...   Update: so it's nice the management cares enough to comment on these reviews. But that can't change my previous experience, or anyone else's. And I'd be a fool to ask for a dish to be replaced in this or any other restaurant. There is no way that can end good in any way, for anyone. \"Sorry dining friends of the evening, our stay will be extended however long it takes to get my second dish that I sure hope doesn't have 'extra' things in it. No no, please continue eating while I sit here awkwardly waiting.\" The better thing to do would be assess the seating situation. Sit at your tables and wonder if people would feel comfortable dining there. Compare your prices to what is offered very near your business. I don't need special treatment. I want what you offer to be something I want to go to, that everyone wants to go to because it's awesome. Not a dark, expensive, mishmash of tables where the servers are as elusive as the comfort. That just can't work and I'll never be able to recommend it. The four cocktails that weren't priced right, were the main attraction and that's really it. No amount of talking about it will change that. So that's what it is. A review of an experience that was less than optimal. You only get one shot at a first impression and what not."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance and design of the place. Now that I live in ATL I miss these old buildings with great bones. From the wood to the wallpaper and the crowd, it was very enjoyable. Cheese curds and drinks were delicious. Since it was a Friday in WI, I did the fish fry which was a solid choice."}
{"text":"The food itself was good enough (mussels, scallops, tenderloin), but not for the price.   And while I was totally digging the music, it's way too loud for a 5:00 dinner crowd on Saturday. We could barely have a conversation without screaming across the table.   Everything took foooreeeeevvvver. Even drinks at 5:00 when there was nearly no one else in the joint, took entirely too long. Our whole dinner experience took 2 1/2 hours, and we rushed her at the end for the bill because we had to be somewhere else. Insane.  They like to conveniently leave ingredients off the menu. We ordered a charcuterie board which came with almonds. Not a big deal unless you're allergic. Never mentioned on the menu. Mussels state they are in a white wine sauce. Once it came out, it's a very obvious cream/dairy based sauce, which if known, would've influenced the choice.  I'm not sure what all the hype is about. This was our first, and last time here."}
{"text":"Poor service, I ordered mussels and they came in a bowl with broth with French fries thrown on top. The broth and fries mixed together, am\nother at our table asked for bread with his pasta, it showed up after the table was cleared, there are better places with better service and food."}
{"text":"We experienced Merchant for the first time last night (Wednesday). The restaurant is in a nice location and has a fresh decor. The initial impression left us hopeful; however, the experience went down hill after being seated.   The space is very noisy! The wait staff was not very attentive to our needs, they were slow and they seemed to be a bit put off by questions we had regarding the menu.   The fare is unique; but, the food is mediocre at best. I had the Truffled White Bean & Prosciutto Toast, Carrot & Ginger Soup and Cured Beef pressed sandwich. Other dishes at the table were Dumplings with Fiddleheads & Ramps, Bib lettuce salad, Artichoke pressed sandwich and the Brussels & Lemon.   The general consensus with our group was that the Brussels & Lemon was the best dish at the table. The toast would be better described as a big crouton. The cured beef sandwich was unimpressive. There was a chef in our group that was unable to detect the ginger in the soup and really could not taste the carrot either. The salad was bland, the dumplings were greasy and the artichoke sandwich tasted like it had Sriracha hot sauce on it.   Two stars go to the Brussels & Lemon, they deserve some recognition. We will probably not return to Merchant. I would not recommend Merchant to a friend."}
{"text":"Was told to go here for drinks but instead I made it over there for breakfast. It was Easter Sunday and they were very busy but I sat at the bar and was served quick. I was going to order a regular omelette but instead the biscuits and gravy caught my ear. It was biscuits in a creamy gravy mixed with sausage. It was so good, I inhaled it and was so full. The bartenders were friendly and asked what I thought about the meal. Hopefully next time I am back in Madison I can get there for drinks."}
{"text":"This place is over rated. Went there for my birthday and had the cous cous. It was unevenly cooked, some parts crunchy some were mushy. Bad sign when the vegetarian dish isn't done well. There are better places for the price."}
{"text":"For now I'm going to give Merchant three stars.  I want to be clear though, it's not because of the food or the ambiance.  Love the decor, it's very posh meets  rustic and a welcome change from most other places in Madison.  The menu is good, there are cheese plates, small plates, large plates, charcuterie and sandwiches.  The food was fantastic.  The cheeses were well selected and I felt the price was very fair for the amount served.  We had the fava bean and prosciutto risotto, I was pleasantly surprised how well the flavors mixed... it was a perfect dish, cooked quite well.  Finally, I had a pressed sandwich which was served with a very small but extra tasty green salad.  Everything I ate was great.  No complaints there.  Now for the negatives, it's a little crowded, I understand the need to fill up the restaurant on a Saturday night, but twice a man sitting near us end up bumping us while he was dining from another table.  Also the service was quite poor.  We ordered the cheese plate first and 5 minutes later the risotto and the risotto came out first.  When we finally wanted to order dinner we had to flag down the waiter.  I'm not sure what the problem was but they were definitely not attentive.  I agree with past posts that the restaurant was loud when we showed up at 8:30 on a Saturday, but it didn't bother me.  I think it went along with the look they are branding.  I will definitely be back to try try this place again."}
{"text":"We're planning a trip to Madison, namely just to go back to this place.  The food is a gastropub wet dream. I wouldn't shut up about the food, or the ambiance, or the music! They were playing a bunch of New Wave stuff. We ordered drinks, and I loved the Agrabah's Flower. Delicate, with a lot of sass. Served with 2 little jasmine flowers floating atop a pink foam.   We sat in the back, near the kitchen- perfect quiet spot! We shared a cheese platter between three people, more than enough for all of us, and I a rabid cheese lover myself. I ordered a special, which was a wide noodle with a tomato based sauce. Very generous portion, SO delicious.   I can't remember what I had, as it's been a couple of months since we were there, but I have pictures, which I sometimes look at fondly, and long to return to this haven of delectable delights for the tastebuds."}
{"text":"Nothing about the dinner made me want to come back but the other reviewers make me want to give it another chance. The atmosphere was nice, but it seemed like a pretentious restaurant since I didn't like the food.   I've been back for cocktails at night and the atmosphere is very different. There's a live dj and dance floor but it's not a very appealing dance floor so I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"The Merchant is my favorite new restaurant/bar in Madison.  I was there recently with old friends and we thoroughly enjoyed our craft cocktails.  The cocktail options are second to none in Madison and perhaps Wisconsin.  I had sandwiches and potato salad several times last summer on Wednesday nights for Concerts on the Square, and every time I found myself craving the next sandwich.  I have had several lunches there and I love how I feel after eating fresh local food after the meal.  At Merchant, I don't feel like a grease bomb is resting in my stomach after I finish a meal!"}
{"text":"I go regularly for Trivia (JFKFC Forever!) and usually get some food and drinks.  The booze is great, some of the people I go with get the tenders choice and it is always something tasty.  I like some old-timey cocktails and they have never made me a bad one.  The food is generally great, really enjoy the chocolate pudding and pork pasta.  Frites and Cheese curds good as well.  I didn't like the muscles though, milky broth was not to my taste.  Not a cheap date, but worth it."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Saturday night with my parents. We were seated right away and served quickly. The wait staff was very nice and brought our orders quickly. They were out of a drink I wanted so the bartender came over and suggested similar drinks I might like. They have a very nice selection of custom cocktails that are all delicious. They even offered to make a custom drink for my mom because she couldn't quite decide what to get from the menu. The food was great and the desserts were rich and tasty! Definitely go here if you like treating yourself."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good mixed drink, then this is the place to go. The bartenders here are amazing. They provide great service and make perfect drinks. If nothing on the drink menu looks good to you then just choose a type of booze you want your drink made with and they'll create a drink for you. When I've gone with this option the bartender asks general questions about what I like and don't like to get a feel for what what will appeal to me, and I've always gotten some of the best drinks this way. They do have a wonderful drink menu though, which always provides a number of great options.  In addition to the exceptional bartenders, the food and service here are good. They use local ingredients. My favorite items they make are their cheese curds, burgers, and french toast."}
{"text":"The food is great and worth checking out. They have a large drink menu, but prices can be steep. The bartenders can across as snooty and pretentious. There is a small dance floor and they have DJ's, it's hit or miss on how great the music and dancing will be. It is pretty dark inside and it can be hard to see the menus. If you're looking for a nice dinner go earlier, it tends to get noisy later in the evening. They have a good happy hour if you're looking for drinks during the week."}
{"text":"My previous experience with The Merchant has revolved with copious amounts of drinks on a blurred Saturday night. In that regard, it's a fun and hip spot with fun and inventive drinks. But recently the husband and I stopped by for brunch on a Saturday morning and were pleasantly surprised. My omelet was stuffed full of fresh veggies and his eggs benedict had a perfect and light hollandaise sauce. All was delicious! My only suggestion for management would be to check out the staff's appearance. Our waitress looked like she just crawled out of a gutter and was covered in hickies. Eeesh!"}
{"text":"This is a mixed review, but I think it's fair. Part of it is because of environment (my personal preferences), and partly because of the food (personal opinion).  On the upside: most of the food was superlative. My wife's lamb sliders were lovely, and worth 5 stars just for them, as was my mom's pear salad. The waitstaff was very attentive but not asking me every three minutes if we were enjoying our meal. The fried cheese curds were among the best I've ever had, super light breading and fresh cheese. WAY better than the Old Fashion's supposedly stellar cheese curds.  So far, a solid 4-star plus review.  But...it's noisy, so noisy it was hard to have a conversation with those at my table. Now if this were a review for a bar, it would easily be a 4-star review. I suppose if I went there as a bar patron, I'd feel differently. If you want blaring music (Blondie? Seriously?), check out the festive atmosphere. But I was there as a diner. Perhaps that was my mistake.  Still, let's give it four stars...but then the mussels came.  The one preparation I felt was poor was the moules et frites. In every place I've ever had moules et frites, they were served in separate containers; the frites in a paper cone, Belgian style, and the mussels in a bowl, usually covered. The fries were on the side and a third of them were soaked with the preparation for the mussels. Not authentic, and not very good. The mussels were exceptionally large and would have been perfect in a lighter sauce. Yes, I am a moules fan, so maybe that's why I was sad they were sub par.  Overall, I feel like it's worth three and a half stars as a restaurant. The bar is huge and clearly these guys do some cool mixology. I'd say go as a bar patron and enjoy some sliders, but I think there are better choices for a quiet dinner rather than a night on the town.  Hats off to the chef for the sliders---they were exceptional, but please work on the moules et frites. I'll come back for brunch and give it another shot."}
{"text":"If you want craft cocktails with food of equal quality, don't miss Merchant. 5 star drinks and food! I would rate it 4-1/2 stars if I could. The reasons I hesitate to go 5 stars overall, the menu is a little limited and it's very dark (at night) and noisy. But if you're primary goal is craft cocktails, Merchant is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Definitely a contender for best restaurant in Madison. The bartenders know their stuff and the kitchen, too. Try the pork paperdelle -  it's amazing."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing out of this world.  The cheese curds were good and different than your average fried curds-not super greasy but really cheesy.  The house-made ranch was amazing! The waitress even brought some extra out with carrots.  The pork pappardelle was good and the house-made ricotta was delicious!  The Beef Carpaccio was also very good but a small portion.  The Merchant Burger was small but packed with flavor. The fries were ordinary. The aioli was out standing! The service was a little slow at times but really friendly!"}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times for dinner and enjoyed it very much. The beef carpaccio is fantastic. I went here for brunch today and wasn't as impressed as I have been with dinner. I got their basic two egg breakfast with saussage. The side potatoes were underwhelming and under seasoned. However my friend's french toast was very good. I'm giving it four stars for the cocktails and dinner, not the potatoes."}
{"text":"Dinner here is usually pretty good. The brunch, however, is not so great. The breakfast burrito today was cold on the inside, and the omelet was a thin layer of egg folded over some room temperature vegetables. In addition, the server never refilled the bottomless coffee, an integral part of breakfast/brunch. For $20 per meal, we left hungry and disappointed enough to create a Yelp account."}
{"text":"If I were 20 or 30 I'd love this place but on a Friday night it was too loud. We went on a Tuesday night and it was much better in the noise department. I do like the atmosphere though.  We had the fish fry. For 17.00 I expect more. 4 small pieces of fish with fries and cole slaw. The first bite of fish was mushy ( need to dry the fish with paper towel before dipping in batter). The other pieces were ok. The fish were perch which usually have a fishy taste but these didn't which I liked. The batter was good. The fries were very good and you get plenty. The cole slaw not so good. It tasted like vinegar and salt dressing. I added some tarter sauce to up the taste. I think they should find another receipt for cole slaw. Rather with mayo or a sweet vinaigrette.  I loved watching the highly skilled bartenders work. Shaking with one hand, stiring with the other hand.  Our waitress was sweet, friendly and attentive.  I'll go back on a weekday to try some other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Heard all kinds of goodness about this place for cocktails and drinks for happy hour so I simply had to go check this place out.....as if I needed a reason to check out the capitol square!  Glad I did (even if it was solo.....again) I had a good time checking this place out. Rustic tavern feel, busting socialization going on at the bar. 830pm on a Thursday night and cold as hell out....did not keep the Madisonians from getting a good drink on!  I got a whiskey sour ($10) and ordered up the chicken breast entree($26). My pics are not the best as the place is dimly lit for lighting but I actually liked that. Candles at your table set the scene well. Live music was going on during my stay as well, bit loud for the size of the place IMO but still good vibes.  My drink came out quick and I loved it. Not a whiskey guy really but they made it work well here.  My entree was awesome. A super tasty sage risotto with butternut squash base with maybe the most tender piece of apple cider glazed chicken breast I have ever had. Topped with cherry-apple chutney to make for the perfect balance of sweet and tartness.   Portions are on the small side IMO but the quality is lacking nothing. You pay a premium for the exclusively locally sourced farm-to-table aspect of this venue.   Service is pretty quick, accurate and tentative. Great place for drinks as everyone says but also a good place for sub grub if paying a little more is OK with you."}
{"text":"After much research, my aunt decided that this was going to be our place! We had a reservation and were seated right away on a Sunday evening.   When we first arrived, our server was very attentive and made sure that we had the drinks that we wanted. I ordered the bartender's choice and was given a bourbon drink. I am not a huge bourbon drinker but it was pretty delicious (and strong). The drink menu itself was very cool because all of the different drinks listed had a sort-of story behind them. This was fun to read at the table and look at all of the different names.   We did not order any appetizers but I got some mixed greens with blue cheese to start. This was delicious but hard to screw up. It is easy to tell that all of their ingredients are farm fresh.   I ordered the teriyaki salmon which came with rice and broccolini. I am a huge fan of all of these things but Merchant Mason just did not deliver. The broccolini was overcooked, burnt in some places. The salmon was very very dry, it would not even flake off. The rice was good but nothing outstanding. The saving grace of this dish was the butternut squash puree that was served with it. My cousin ordered a dumpling soup which had an Asian twist. It was delicious and I had major food envy. My mom ordered a burger which, in her opinion, was meh. My cousin and aunt ordered the quinoa bowl (our server said this was very popular) but they said it was way too salty.   The restaurant itself is very cool. They have a little alcohol shop so you can purchase what was in your drink which I thought was a nice touch. The atmosphere is very trendy and I loved the space.   The reason that it is only getting 3 stars is because of the food. For the price, the food did not meet our standards. Really cool restaurant and if I lived closer, I would give it another try."}
{"text":"When the right bartenders are working, this is a dynamite bar. The drink menu is enormous and sure to please a wide palate of tastes. When coming on an off night, the drinks are just ok. I'll gladly risk coming on an off night in the hopes they are making drinks well that night."}
{"text":"Truly a foodie's paradise. I've come twice. The first time, I had the sliders, while my girlfriend had quinoa salad. The quinoa salad was amazing. The Korean chef had an experimental dish with asparagus and kochuchang sauce. Although the taste was interesting, I wasn't a huge fan. I suspect it might be more tasty for someone who doesn't eat kochuchang in every other meal though.  The other time, I came on cheap date night and we had a chicken spaghetti dish, which was also incredible.   Overall the ambiance was great for dates - dark but not obnoxiously so."}
{"text":"Good drinks,good food. Service was strange. Our server may have been new. Soup came out after entrees. Weird right. Everything was tasty . Great atmosphere.and drinks. Bar was very hands on. Do not know how it would be with a crush of customers."}
{"text":"Great drinks, great people, great service. Price is what you would expect for this quality. I had great service and despite one small issue (that was taken care of inn seconds) this is a jewel."}
{"text":"It was my first time to Madison and Merchant was recommended by a friend. The cocktails, wine, food, and service were all outstanding. I would definitely come back my next time in town."}
{"text":"I've been to Merchant three times. There won't be a fourth. I thought perhaps, my first experience was an off-night. Second time was with friends. Third time sealed the deal.  The menu is unusually limited.  There are showcases around the restaurant displaying fresh ingredients. Unfortunately, the menu disappoints after seeing the showcases.   The atmosphere is loud and echoing. It's difficult to hear across the table sometimes. Add live music to the mix and it becomes even more so. The extensive bar menu of specialty drinks is the saving grace to this restaurant. Dim lighting makes it incredibly difficult to read, and I'm not old!  My experience at the bar has been frustrating. Waiting longer than usual to get attention from one of the bartenders, (once waiting while they continue to talk to someone at the bar and dry glasses). If you have breasts and are single, you'll get quicker service.  With all the restaurants that Madison has to offer, there are plenty within the immediate neighborhood offering better service, a more accommodating atmosphere, and a larger variety of menu options."}
{"text":"I've spent multiple evenings at Merchant, and whatever the occasion it is a great place to go. Whether it's a dinner with friends, co-workers, a date, or solo at the bar, you can't go wrong with this place. The cocktails are fantastic, as are the bartenders. The food is limited but good, the buffalo style cheese curds are great, as is the burger, mussels, and other dishes. This place is a cocktail bar first, so the wine and beer options are limited but sufficient."}
{"text":"Overcooked and flavorless bison steak. Invest in a meat thermometer if you are going to cook a steak cut that thick. Cold frites that were nothing special. Tasty yet pricey cocktails.   Atmosphere was okay, but it did feel like a bar that serves food. A bit too noisy for conversation beyond the person next to you."}
{"text":"First let me say the people are amazing and service is excellent!  My wife and I went for brunch on Saturday. We were very interested in trying their eggs Benedict because we were told by the hostess that the sauce was homemade from scratch.  My wife ordered the regular eggs Benedict and I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict. When they arrived the portions were small and there was very little sauce on them and they were accompanied by a pile of lettuce that had a good tasting dressing on it. My wife asked for some extra sauce and they promptly brought it out.  I thought the sauce was rather bland for a homemade sauce. It was very light but lacked richness and did not have any lemon flavor to it. The salmon was an extra dollar but the salmon to my disappointment tasted like it was a frozen patty or made from a can.  It really would've been 100% better if it were fresh salmon. The Canadian bacon style ham on my wife's was much better and it was cheaper. Because of the small portions we quickly finish them off and were still hungry. Overall the atmosphere was pleasant. The service was excellent but the food was sub par. My total bill for two meals was over $50. I would not likely go back and purchase this meal. It was definitely not worth the price."}
{"text":"I've always loved this place since its conception. Fantastic."}
{"text":"An adult cocktail bar oasis amidst downtown college bars...I only went to Merchant for drinks and it was late-night. The only reason  we found it was because it was a block from our hotel and honestly, were on our way to another bar. Form the outside it looked cool and the music was a bit of indie-british something or other and it lured us in. It is a warehouse-style space and the dj was entirely too loud. My boyfriend dj's himself and was complaining about it. It wasn't the right place for volume of that caliber!   Anyhow, I browsed their cocktail list of classic cocktails and ordered the Aviation, which I found spot-on. TAll of the cocktails I tried were very well made, and I even requested a different classic cocktail from one of the bartenders and he made it perfectly. The bartenders were all helpful and unpretentious, which is rare in mixology bars. I guess when you have a mix of people drinking PBRs and people drinking classic cocktails, you really can't be that pretentious! I liked the vibe, despite the overly loud music. Next time I'm in Madison I will make it a point to go back there--and probably try some food, too."}
{"text":"We actually came to Merchant twice during our long weekend in Madison, but wish we had left it to one.  We stopped in Saturday late afternoon for a drink and a snack.  Based on this brief visit alone, this review would have been 5 stars.  Easy to snag seats at the bar, beyond amazing bartenders who knew exactly what to recommend in terms of beer despite their obvious strong suit being cocktails (totally regret not getting one), and delish cheese curds.  Our visit on Saturday was so great that we decided to come back for brunch on Sunday morning before leaving town.  Brunch was underwhelming.  Their menu is somewhat small, the food took FOREVER, and the end result was just okay.  My boyfriend wasn't thrilled with his tiny breakfast sandwich on a biscuit.  I thought my croissant sandwich was pretty good although I subbed bacon for the ham.  We got a side of fries since there is no potato option and those were pretty good (aioli was yummy).    Maybe we had too high expectations based on our brief visit the night before, but I don't think we'd return for brunch. I would come back for a cocktail and the cheese curds if I'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"First time trying Merchant, but I'm always looking for good restaurants to keep on my list. My husband and I went for dinner on a Thursday night. It wasn't too crowded, we were seated right away. We had the cheese curds for an appetizer and they were great. There were several items on the menu I was interested in trying, but I ended up having the quail, which was really good. My husband had the lamb sliders and was also happy with that. He was confused as to why they wouldn't have a bloody mary on the cocktail menu though. I had a cocktail and it was okay, not as great as Heritage Tavern's drinks though. I love that they have Mexican Coke there, because I'm allergic to corn so I can't have regular sodas with corn syrup in them.   Service was pretty good, I don't remember having to wait very long for anything, including the check at the end. All in all I was very satisfied and would go back again.   The only thing I didn't like was that the music was insanely loud! I'm 29, so I'm not crotchety about music believe me. But the restaurant wasn't even crowded, and my husband and I were having to basically shout to hear each other while sitting at a two-person table!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a decent cocktail in Madison then this is your place.  I had a whiskey sour, which was super tasty and then I moved on to several Moscow Mules. Details are slightly hazy from that point on...but I know it was a good time. The atmosphere is certainly cool, the decor is very turn of the century meets trendy. The location is good and the drinks are affordable for being a 'mixology' bar.  My only complaint is that dj was playing bad music as loud as it would go and there were probably a total of 15 people inside the bar...only three drunk girls were dancing. I play records on occasion...I like loud music...but a good dj knows when to keep the music on a conversational level."}
{"text":"The atmosphere felt - crafted - artificial. The cocktails that are hand crafted by a mixologist (and I had like three of them and tasted those of my companions) were so-so. My palate isn't sophisticated enough to enjoy their menu. I was hungry and wanted food to eat - not savor."}
{"text":"Food and drinks are good but they need some better training for their employees. The host gave away our table to another group. The employees didn't know each other. The manager was very apologetic when I explained the situation but we ended up going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Merchant multiple times for brunch, and it's my absolute favorite Madison restaurant for a morning meal. For brunch, Merchant is consistent in serving solid, well-thought-out, perfectly cooked and delicious entrees. I absolutely recommend it!  The smoked salmon eggs benedict is wonderful. The scotch eggs are wonderful. The OJ is freshly squeezed, and it's wonderful. The sour cream coffee cake is wonderful. Even the coffee is wonderful.  On many Saturdays, I've visited Merchant for brunch prior to shopping at the farmer's market. In fact, I've tried brunch at several other downtown Madison restaurants that have a similar \"fresh\"/\"farm to table\" food concept. And every time, Merchant wins, hands down.  PS: Chyna, who works on Saturday mornings, has been our server a few times. We're going to just make it a habit to request to sit her section."}
{"text":"The steak fritte was lacking to say the least.  The steak was a medallion shape and the fries were inedible after 3 minutes.  The eager and kind staff was clearing plates of uneaten fries as I was still eating.  The sauce that accompanied the steak could only be described as what emptiness tastes like."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the food and drinks. The downsides are that it is somewhat busy and they don't take reservations usually. The patio is good. So go at a less busy time and you will be fine."}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday breakfast with a group of 8 after we all tied one on the night before. They're from out of town and think of Merchant as part of the \"Madison Experience,\" which is hilarious because I never go here with my fellow townie friends. I only eat here with people from out of town who looked it up online and like the branding/packaging.  This last trip to Merchant might be my last. It was maybe 1/3 full. Nice and dark atmosphere...perfect for dealing with a headache while waiting for your Advil to kick in. Waitstaff wasn't running around freaking out, so they seemed to have things under control. Turns out they just DGAF. I needed coffee and a Bloody Mary ASAP. Friggin waitress took 10 minutes to greet me, and then 25 MORE minutes to get me my drinks!!! I was about to lose my mind...I mean, I get it if we all ordered super complicated & fussy craft cocktails. We ordered water, coffee or mimosas. I was the only one with the \"complicated\" drink (you jam some celery and a pickle in Bloody Mary mix--SO frustrating, I know!). I think our waitress must've been hand-squeezing the oranges for the mimosas, because it took an insanely long amount of time for drinks. Maybe she was new? But most likely she just DGAF.  Food was great, hit the spot. Service is usually meh, but this time it was terrible. Merchant is never at the top of my list when choosing places to eat. It's like they only hire people who give zero F's.  On the plus side, the decor is pretty, and the wall of wine storage is gorgeous to look at."}
{"text":"The ambiance is so entrancing... I could sit there all day and sip on one of their quirky beverages! Perfect for date night or girls/friends night out!"}
{"text":"My review for this place stays solidly at 4-stars. This was the first time I had dinner there.  Their drink menu is stellar as are their apps. I really do love this place for the drink and quick bite. However, dinner?  It was tasty but wow was it slow. The server was SOOOOO slow with everything. I get it is nice to just relax through dinner, but this pace and attentiveness level was super slow. Our server was also a bit weird. I felt like he was unable to make eye contact or be around other humans. He just was not personable.   I had the paperdelle and several drinks. One of which is the Jack Rose. Honestly, the place was delicious and but the vibe? It kind of made me feel weird. I won't lie."}
{"text":"Great bar, good food, high prices, always crowded. Happy to have them as a Madison staple."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. I'm not trying to be snobby, but I'm a little spoiled by the restaurant scene in Chicago and didn't expect that much our of Madison.  I was wrong.  This place supports local state farmers and even shows you, on its menu, who and where they are.  Four out of the five people, including me, ordered the pork pappardelle.  I wanted to lick the plate. It was probably the best pasta dish I've had all year!  The other person got the muscles and told us the next day that he could have drank the sauce they came in it was so good.  We had a phenomenal server from California.  You could tell she loves her job, which made the experience that much better.  We were here for the ironman, so unfortunately we didn't get to try out any of thee cocktails, but there menu looked amazing.  They are definitely part of the craft cocktail movement.   Overall, I can't wait to get back here to eat, and drink, again"}
{"text":"Great location for snacks, meals and craft drinks.    We had the lamb sliders with a side salad, cheese curds and the seasonal ricotta board.  Small plates that filled us up.  The service is always great here. 10/10 this place is a Madison gem."}
{"text":"Dark and very loud.  Is it a nightclub or restaurant?  Obviously targeting the 30 something Epic crowd.  Food was good, but over-priced given the atmosphere.  Service good.   Will not be returning"}
{"text":"Oh Merchant. I want to love you. You're like a student who tries super hard, comes to office hours, does the reading, talks in class, but then always seems to come up a little short on testing day.   I've never had a bad meal at Merchant, but I've also never been blown away. Same for the cocktails, which scream trying really really hard to impress you more than they actually impress you. And same for the overall vibe, which I find a little schizophrenic; I get the fancy marketplace theme (with the deli case and the liquor on the wall), although it kind of feels like a non sequitur given the actual food on the plates and the style of service. And then suddenly weekend nights there's a DJ and big dance party. To me, it just doesn't quite come together.   That said, I do like Merchant, even if I don't love it. I do recommend the brunch, which is surprisingly relaxed in contrast to some other brunch places around the square. And like I said, the food in general has been solid if not spectacular.   Keep trying, Merchant..."}
{"text":"The best dining experience in a long time.  We were greeted by excellent waiter Trent who set the evening with info on craft cocktails and enormous wine and beer selection.  The Brussels sprouts were best ever.  The ginger squash soup delighted every taste bud.  The burger was fresh and so tasty.  The beet salad delighted with many favors and the warm apple crisp was perfect way to end the night complimented with tasty champagne.  So many great choices in Madison. Be sure to get to this place. Great bar scene too"}
{"text":"Every once in a while, I feel obligated to write a review as much to review the restaurant, as to counter some prior reviews. This is the case for Merchant. My wife and I went to Merchant on a Wednesday evening for dinner to celebrate her birthday. We were in a good mood, and ready for a good experience. We weren't disappointed.  We were welcomed warmly by a friendly young woman and given our choice of tables. Our waitress quickly approached and inquired about drinks. My wife ordered on of the specialty craft drinks - a \"Stalker.\" (Celery, Bombay Sapphire, bitters, citrus, and vermouth). She described it as \"wonderful.\" We ordered a bottle of wine; a good thing on Wednesday because it's $10 off.  We had an appetizer of mussels. They had a subtle coconut milk sauce and were very fresh tasting. We soaked up the remaining sauce with the accompanying toast, which our waitress generously supplemented.  My wife had the trout and I the lamb shank. Both were delicious and wonderfully flavored. Portions were generous.  Desserts were delicious - dark chocolate pound cake and an apple crisp.  The atmosphere is pleasantly upbeat.  What I want to make a point of is that the service couldn't have been better. Attentive, friendly, not overly intrusive, and helpful. I noted before coming that two prior reviews had harshly criticized the service. I also saw that the owner had responded, so I thought it certainly deserved a chance. Needless to say, as far as I am concerned, any service problems have been corrected.  (If you are seated along the outside wall, and it is cold out, wear a sweater because the cold radiates from the windows.)  I strongly recommend Merchant to anyone who has a prior bad experience."}
{"text":"First of all, the amount of new reviewers who gave merchant 5 stars sketches me out. The market-hybrid-restaurant idea sounds good on paper, but it's not anything special in real life.  Overall, we agreed that the experience was just kind of okay. The restaurant interior is pretty cool - neat layout and decor. The inside is very LOUD and it's hard to hear anyone.  Food was a tad overpriced in my opinion. The food felt either \"this came from a jar/can (toasts)\" or \"this could be good but wasn't cooked well (duck).\" The sunchoke risotto was great. Cocktails are $9 and not exceptional.  I'll be back in a couple weeks to check in, but for now, just kind of okay. I'm debating between 2&3 stars."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Will absolutely come back here!! One of the reasons I came to this spot is because of a yelp review saying they had a good gin fizz! They were right one of the beat I ever had. The charcuterie platters were amazing and so was their pasta dishes. Highly recommended. Gets crowded I recommend reservations"}
{"text":"I won't be back after being held hostage for 3 hours with a bunch of friends from out of town. It took us forever to get seated, forever to get drinks, forever to get refills, forever to get our orders taken, and forever to actually get our meals. Very disappointed :("}
{"text":"My gf surprised me with a 15 person reservation @ Merchant for my birthday.  I was worried they wouldn't be able to accommodate us. I was wrong.  They did an awesome job.  I couldn't believe how fast the food came out!  Everyone love their food.  I had the scallops which were damn tasty.  They were expensive though... 3 scallops for $27.  I do wish they had a more expansive menu.  They have a novel as a drinks menu and just a 1 sided sheet of paper for food."}
{"text":"I was sitting at the bar with two of my friends, having a good ol' bitch fest, when the bartender came over gave us a complimentary shot of \"chill the fuck out.\" That was what he called it - it was just a house whiskey, but it really put us in a better mood.  The service was great. We sat at the bar for probably around 3-4 hours, and were never given the evil eye to move on.   They make a great Moscow Mule, it's not in a copper cup unfortunately, but is very refreshing for a hot, humid Madison day. I also ordered the French 75 which is another great summer drink. Go during happy hour where many of their craft cocktails are $6."}
{"text":"10 stars for the cocktails   2 stars for the food.  Absolutely the best place in Madison for creative old school and new school drinks.  Bartenders always remember your name and make you feel welcome.   Unfortunately the food falls on its face here.  Beyond the grilled cheese it just is bland."}
{"text":"Great lunch. We had the squash soup, a grilled cheese and honey sandwich, and a wonderful blue cheese, squash, and lettuce salad. Outstanding atmosphere too. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place we will visit again. Parking can be a pain but the food is worth it.   Grilled Pork Chop - Was tender and juicy. I had no shame picking this up and eating it like a rib towards the end.   Classic Burger - Very tasty. Cooked medium-rare and topped with a runny egg, just the way I requested it. Not to mention, the side of aioli which is AMAZING. One of the best aioli's I've tried.   Cheese curds - These didn't last long enough to take a picture so you can tell they were good."}
{"text":"I give this place five stars for the drinks alone.  Food is great for American fare.  The Regret is a local favorite as a cocktail - mine is the Blood and Sand."}
{"text":"Food is awesome, cocktails are amazing, great atmosphere and great staff. Our go to date night place (on the fancier date night end). It's crowded, noisy, and energetic which I like on a weekend night. They take reservations on opentable which is nice!"}
{"text":"Excellent craft cocktails and food.  Their burgers are especially amazing.  I was impressed that we went here during restaurant week (we avoid going out on restaurant week) and their menu wasn't a dumbed-down version of their normal menu, as happens at so many places on restaurant week.  They still did their usual, strong work, rather than succumb to the high-turnover urge of restaurant week."}
{"text":"Came to Merchant Madison for a birthday dinner and it did not disappoint.   The atmosphere in the restaurant is super intimate and romantic at night. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and also oh-so-nice. I hate that I can't remember her name, but she really made our dining experience perfect.  First of all, the Ploughman's Charcuterie Board is hands-down the best I have ever encountered. The selection is so well curated and every item is delicious individually or together. For the entree, I ordered the moules frites and my companion got the tagliatelle, which were also fantastic. We ordered the chocolate cherry mousse for dessert, and it is amazing.   Towards the end of the night, they dimmed the lights and started playing 90s hip hop.  Honestly, everything was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"For a long time I was in the camp of \"come for the cocktails, stay for more cocktails\" when it came to Merchant. The food wasn't bad, I just wasn't overly impressed-and with all the amazing food around town, Merchant just wasn't at the top of my list for the solids. That all changed this week. The bf and I came for Summer Restaurant Week and wow, we were impressed. The homemade ricotta (he had the salad, I had the olives) was a delightful surprise. I had the Merchant burger as my main and per the waitress, the toppings change seasonally. This summer's toppings are pesto (which was incredible), Havarti, bacon (absurdly delicious bacon, that is) and a few other things I can't remember. The burger patty itself wasn't anything special but the bun was perfect and the combo of flavors really tipped this burger over the edge into greatness.  I happened to end up back here a few days later for brunch with a friend. Not being much of a breakfast fan, I went for the fried chicken sandwich. It was awesome. It comes with a carrot-heavy coleslaw and a yummy aioli. I opted for the buffalo sauce on the side and spread it on every other bite or so. Nice flavor combos indeed. My friend thoroughly enjoyed her breakfast burrito.  The cocktails are still really where Merchant shines but, for me, the food finally caught up this week. Go soon and try the \"Come hell or high watermelon\" cocktail-perfect for a hot summer's day.  Service has always been excellent-prompt, attentive, friendly. If you find street parking a hassle, there is a city structure across the street."}
{"text":"Merchant Madison offers a casual farm-to-table experience. The cocktail menu reads like a storybook, and is filled with axing hand-crafted drinks. The menu has a sophisticated flare. We enjoyed a number of small plates, including a great locally-sourced charcuterie and cheese board on our first visit. During another visit we enjoyed brunch. This is a great choice for any meal. The staff will tell you where your food came from and how it was prepared."}
{"text":"food is decent. it is very busy place but service was very slow. good place to watch sports games. there's bar sections and dining sections."}
{"text":"I really appreciate reviews for peope who eat gluten free.  I have celiac and was nervous about traveling to a new area.  We live near SF and there is a lot of awareness and I wasn't sure what it would be like in Wisconsin.  Well, I can say Madison blew San Francisco out of the water.  The whole town is so tuned into it and most restaurants have gluten free menus.  The best restaurant that we ate at and who had an outstanding understanding of celiac disease was the Merchant.  Our waiter was phenominal.  He knew every drink and dish that I could have, including cross contamination issues.  For a small upcharge they served many dishes with a side of gluten free flatbread.  It was amazing.  I really miss bread at restaurants so this was such a treat.  They buy it from a local GF bakery.  I had to swat my husbands hand away from the basket several times and remind him he could eat the normal bread.  Apart from the gluten free stuff, the food was great, the atmosphere was upscale without being stuffy and because we ate during the world cup there was a lot of energy and it was really fun.  We have two small kids and it was perfect for them too.  I wish they would open up a restuarant in San Francisco!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner after reading Yelp reviews and was not disappointed.  Cocktails were awesome, food very good.  We started out with the Axl Rose cocktail and a dish/Lodge cast-iron skillet of warms olives.  Both excellent.  Entrees wee steak frites and pork pappardelle.  Steak was perfectly cooked, fries were good but a bit unremarkable.  Side salad was nondescript.  Pasta was delicious -- toothsome and meaty.  We would go back, primarily to drink more of the craft cocktails and try the whiskey flights."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side but their cheese curds are excellent and they do a nice \"roll the dice\" drink special. Pick your choice of liquor (you can specify if you prefer sweet, fruity, dry style of drink) and the bartender will craft you something totally random!  Also a decent spot to go dancing, if you're not one for super crowded floors."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch or happy hour!  Somewhat limited food menu, but everything, including the cocktails, is fresh and served with a smile.  Nice atmosphere and great location."}
{"text":"The Merchant knows food, but not cooking. The ingredients and sourcing are fabulous. But that baseline quality was wasted by the kitchen.  We went for the weekend brunch. That is what this review is for. The nighttime scene might be an entirely different deal.   The pork belly breakfast torta, though described accurately on the menu, does not approximate a torta, mainly due to the use of English muffin as the sandwich bread. Bad choice. A softer, less crumbly bread would better reference the torta experience. The pork belly itself was over cooked and not tender. Greasy (as pork belly will be), but hard. Not the greasy-and-tender that would've made the thing great eating. The fried potato wedges that accompanied the \"torta\" were fried way too hard, verging on burned, with the  starchy part of the potato fried out, except for the very deepest interior of each wedge. Unpleasantly hard.  The shrimp & grits suffered the same. The shrimp were over cooked. Please, can chefs at the Merchant (and in Madison generally) cultivate a little subtlety? The shrimp are DONE when they turn opaque, not when the edges caramelize. The grits were okay, but how difficult is that to cook?  I ordered \"a side of greens\"-said in exactly those words- with the shrimp & grits. What was brought to me was a side green salad, not the side of collard greens. That was a little strange, given the southern entree naturally goes with a southern side. Whatever, I won't hold that against the restaurant, since it is Wisconsin and the server might not have internalized those intra-menu relationships. But still, it is supposed to be a chowhound place....  The staff corrected the mistake immediately and comped both sides. I appreciated that courtesy and tipped them well. If only the kitchen did as well. Seeing as how the room was not busy at all when we were there, only about half full, I cannot cut the brunch chef any slack."}
{"text":"The atmosphere at Merchant is amazing. The craft drinks are also wonderful.   I was, however, less impressed with the food. My partner and I went for Restaurant Week. I was very excited because I had heard great things in the past. We had the salad and the cheese curds for the first course. My partner ordered the pork pappardelle and I had the Mahi Mahi. He ended with the cheese plate and I had the chocolate custard.   To be fair the first and third courses were good. The salad was very basic and the cheese curds were delicious. The house ranch was good. The pork however was incredibly underwhelming. The pasta was lumped together instead of tossed in the sauce. The sauce itself was bland even with the pork sausage. The mahi mahi, which I thought had a puree garnish was literally in an onion/pear soup. I was worried that it was meant to overcompensate for the somehow still powerful \"fishy\" taste to the mahi mahi. The flavor combinations just did not work for me and I was not expecting it to all be drowning in puree. The cheese plate was delightful and I would recommend and the chocolate custard was good but honestly the portion, again, was tiny.   Overall, the portion size was small for the overall cost. I'm fine with smaller portions in higher price ranges if they are really good but Merchant was mediocre to okay at best.   If you are looking for good drinks and maybe some apps and/or desert its probably worth it and will be good, but if you are going for the entree's may I recommend another location."}
{"text":"Merchant has a great happy hour, amazing cocktails and beer selection, delicious food, and excellent service. I've had the pleasure of having Jack as my bartender every time that I've visited so far and he's made my experience a pleasant and memorable one each time. This place is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I went for brunch so this review is just based on that, I have no opinion on drinks and other meals.  For a brunch that seems like love was made into the dishes, Merchant Madison does a great job.   A friend and I both got the omelette made with oyster mushrooms and sauteed onions with potatoes and a side salad. I am not giving five starts because the salad contained a ton of frieze, when it should have had more spring lettuce. Frieze is not a good base lettuce because it is so prickly. The potatoes were AMAZING, perfect amount. The omelet was delicious too but was also coated in oil (so it would come out of the pan perfectly?), which I know is not necessary, just a gross shortcut. I just ignored that unneeded added calories.   Coffee was great. Price was great too for quality and size."}
{"text":"This is my new #1 restaurant in Madison. I've been there on a few occasions for dinner and/or cocktails, and it's never failed to deliver.  More than once, a dining companion has mentioned, \"I don't feel like I'm in Madison when I'm here.\" I'm not sure what it is exactly, but Merchant offers a distinct atmosphere with its theme, lighting, and unique craft cocktails.  Merchant is committed to offering the best of the best in ingredients, which are also available for purchase - hence the commitment to the theme of providing 'the freshest and finest local and international ingredients.' My personal favorites include The Last Word and Aviation Cocktail, but you should definitely peruse the menu before making a decision. There is also a nice selection of wine and other beverages.  Food options include a series of small plates and large plates which can be shared (but do not have to be). A particular favorite is the lavender and honey cheese sandwich. While the food is delicious, the reason I am a frequent repeat guest to Merchant is the atmosphere. Overall, a consistently fun and exciting evening - definitely worth checking out for anyone interested in a new Madison experience."}
{"text":"A loud and chaotic space, artful food, good portions, and decent prices.  The fried potatoes with aioli was decedent, greasy, crunchy, and outstanding. The \"Merchant\" house burger was enormous and a little bizarre. I can't say that I loved it like a good old bacon cheeseburger, but the combo of a fried egg, fried brisket, and then a huge burger made of brisket and sirloin was meaty to the max, almost to overkill, but still intriguing. Major points for creativity.  I opted for the cauliflower and caraway soup on the side, which was creative, thick, fresh, and a pretty large for a cup serving. It would have served better as an amuse. The first 4-5 spoons were fascinating, with three distinct and shifting flavors on the palette, but 25 spoons into it the heaviness of the cream and strength of anise became burdensome.  Pasta with crab and cheese was a nice serving of crab though a little heavy-handed with an unctuous cheese overtone. The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the size of the dish was excellent. I'd order it again.   Major kudos for kicking Scott Walker out of the restaurant to national press attention in 2011.  Recommended."}
{"text":"This is a great place to get hipster cocktails. The food is average, expensive and has small portions. Don't eat here. Drink prices are reasonable and quality is high. Packed and loud most of the time."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks, these guys provide a nice, fun atmosphere to sit back and relax with friends. Make sure you try the cheese curds."}
{"text":"Ok, so to get the easy out of the way - the food and drink were great.  Maybe not 5 stars - but a solid 4.  What got us to 5 stars then?  Her name is Kristin and she is a saint.  Showed up for a reservation on a Saturday night as a 4 top.  3 of us will eat almost anything, and like it.  1 of us (not me) is a picky eater but we adore her nonetheless.  For this week's menu, she could not find a single thing that agreed with her.  Our server Kristin had the patience of a Saint - she went above and beyond to essentially do a custom dinner for our picky one, always with a smile.  It was really nice to see her so accommodating.  So Merchant gets 5 stars today - the 5th one due to Kristin!    PS - It also happened to be a Mad Men themed evening which was awesome to watch."}
{"text":"My husband and I were first timers at Merchant this past Saturday. Around 8 O'clock the bar and dining area were packed. I automatically fell in love with the design and d√©cor which was a combination of industrial rustic and prohibitionThe host politely greeted us and we were told it would be about a 20-30 minute wait which was fine with us because after all it was a Saturday night.   A few minutes later a server walked by and asked if we would like anything to drink while we were waiting. My husband order an Old Fashioned and I ordered a Side Car (at the servers recommendation). Five minutes later he came back with the best cocktails we have ever had in  Madison. They were strong but not over powering.   We found two lounge chairs in the back and relaxed until our table was ready. In the mean time the same server came back and checked on us and brought us water. After about a 20  minute wait we were seated in his section.    He gave us a run down of the restaurant and it's history and recommended another round of superb drinks. He even went as far to explain exactly how the drinks were maid and gave us a recipe! Talk about going above and beyond!   Fast forward to the food. We ordered the scallops and Olives as appetizers and they were at our table in less than 10 minutes.   The scallops were perfectly cooked, crispy on the top and bottom and flaked easily with a fork. The sauce was mouth watering and the cabbage and bacon complimented the dish perfectly.   The olives came in a huge portion with ricotta on top and warm bread and again were fabulous!   Around 9 they started playing old school rap (Biggie, Tupac etc.) which is the way to my heart! The DJ was setting up around 9:30 just was we were leaving which is a major bummer because we probably would have stayed until closing if we hadn't had previous engagements.   Overall I would have to say this is my new favorite bar in Madison! We will definitely be going back in the next few weeks!"}
{"text":"Wow... don't sit on the left side of the bar. I was sprayed with water.  When I asked for a towel the guy just threw it at me. No apology, just an \"are you okay?\" And an awkward offer for a free drink when she realized I wasn't happy. Not what I wanted after a stressful day.  Mistakes happen and I will go back... just avoiding that side.  Drink was pretty good,  decent happy hour specials.  Just... hopefully next time is better."}
{"text":"Oh my oh my oh my...We had a few of these fancier farm to table restaurants on our list when we visited Madison, and boy am I glad we ended up at Merchant! We went on a weekday evening and there was a pretty full crowd, but we were seated quickly. I am sure on weekends it gets very full and planning for a wait or a reservation would be recommended.   Decor is low light, touches of Victorian elegance mixed with warm wood-based bar kind of feel. The menu is small and curated and changes with the seasons and availability of food. There were a reasonable amount of vegetarian options, and we ended up sharing several small and two large plates between three persons and were very happy. The food was simply divine. Olives sound like a rather basic option, but trust me when I say that if you order the warm olives small plate you will have your socks knocked off. The gnocchi (vegetarian option) was a huge hit with everyone and we couldn't believe the level of smokey flavor they had on the root veggies. Cocktail options were fun and interesting, starting around $10 and going up. They have an extension spirits and wine list, as well.  Service was excellent. We especially appreciated the Cava and dessert that was offered to us as part of our friend's birthday. Merchant is a slightly higher end experience (not a break the bank one, though), but if you want high quality food fresh from local purveyors (they have a map of where most of their ingredients come from on the back of the menu!) you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I went to Merchant recently with a lot of questions as to how the experience would turn out with the restaurant also having a grocery component in it.    When I arrived I was greeted by a very friendly host and decided to sit at the bar for dinner.    I had the hummus appetizer, which was amazing.  The bread was fresh, warm, and toasted.  The presentation of the dish was also great.  I wasn't sure as to which of the cocktails to try so I asked the bartender for some input.  At the suggestion of the bartender I tried the whiskey sour.  It was also amazing.    For my meal I had the chicken and dumplings.  The chicken was very moist while the skin was really crisp.  The chef did a great job in preparing the meal and it tasted fantastic.  If you aren't sure what to have for dinner and if the chicken and dumplings is on the dinner menu (it changes daily, I believe) then you definitely need to try that.   After dinner the bartender asked me if I'd like anything else to drink.  I told him I wasn't in the mood for a beer, but I was also unsure as to which cocktail I'd like to try.  The bartender told me that he could make an off the menu after dinner drink for me, which was absolutely fantastic.  It went down smooth and wasn't strong. It was some of the best service I've had.  I understand the reviews on here from when the restaurant first opened were mixed, but I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in Madison or stopping through Madison.  Merchant definitely exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Looking for a night cap after a really nice dinner nearby, we were attracted to the space by the amble bottles of back bar visible from the street. Glad we stumbled in as this has to be the coolest bar/restaurant/deli/store/etc/etc in town. We were amazed by how much is really going on here, and that is a good thing!  As other reviewers have stated, the bartenders (and that is an insult to label these talented professionals as that) are fantastic. Super knowledgeable but also attentive and social. These guys treat the cocktail as a work of Art. So nice to see the passion from staff. Next time we will eat for sure.....or maybe just enjoy the drinks again. Can't wait to go back. 4 stars only because we didn't eat but bar is 5 star for sure."}
{"text":"I stayed at the ruby marie hotel in madison after driving in from Chicago looked for a good restaurant.  Merchant Madisonhad the menu for that nights dinner up on website with the pledge that they cook local ingredients and map listing the farms.  There's a cocktail program. We went and started with 3 Wisconsin cheeses- cow, blue and goat, honey comb, pecans, dry cherry and toast.  I had a cup of root soup, very fall, with lightly grilled fluffy texas toast.  My partner had a rye manhattan and it had lemon and orange zest and a cherry and I had ginger limeade.  For dinner we split sweet pork belly with red beans and spice pickled chiles and a rare hangar steak with candied onions and spice cream potatoes.  It was all rich and I liked it. For dessert I had cherry cobbler with almond streusel and vanilla gelato in an iron skillet- sour juicy door county cherries."}
{"text":"We meet friends here for drinks after their meal, they had good things to say about the food. The drinks were good as well."}
{"text":"So we were meeting a group of business types at 8pm on a Friday evening.. Our place is close enough so we decide to walk the length of Pinckney St. til we find ourselves at Merchant's door.  We saunter the way we do to the bar, and as I am walking I'm observing that the atmosphere is certainly geared toward the food crowd, with a bar the length of the entire restaurant and fully packed with patrons.  The hosts at the entrance were accommodating to our large group and even made space for us to socialize and talk, no pressure to sit and eat- they were lovely.  It was loud with voices echoing off of the walls, packed from the dinner crowd, and efficient with staff.    10pm rolled around and we found ourselves still fully immersed in Merchant. Staff came and got us and said the dinner crowd was done if we wanted to move up front and commence with the stories, the chatter, the networking, and laughter.  Soon tables were moved and a dance floor created, suddenly there was music being played - it was all encompassing.  Through the doors came a new type, the club type, the single, the sophisticated,  young and older all sitting at the bar chatting, along the windows and at tables lined by the wall, standing closely engaged in discussion and creating the mood - couples out dating and those there to hunt.    Can't say it's a common pattern for hubby and I to find ourselves in the thick of an atmosphere Merchant was asking us to partake in - can't say it's unfamiliar to us, either.  The music hit us and the beat got inside and suddenly we were the only two in the room. We weaved our way into the beat and lost ourselves in those moments.  Afterwards we found ourselves hand in hand walking past the capital, the night was calm, alive with our laughter.  Merchant provides."}
{"text":"Our hotel had recommended we go to Graze for dinner. Upon arrival on a Wednesday night we were told there was a one hour wait. Well I wouldn't wait an hour for Brad Pitt much less a restaurant. It looked nice and extremely busy (right across from the Capital) but not worth an hour wait. Across the \"hall\" was another restaurant that had literally no one in it but the menu was extremely pricey and was a bit \"too too\" for me. Not my kind of food.  We walked for about 5 minutes and came upon Merchant Grocery. I am sure glad we did as well and so was my friend. We were immediately seated. It has a cool style to the design. Great vibe. It is known more as a bar (though you wouldn't really know it by the size of restaurant versus the bar. When you walk in on the left is a whole wall of different whiskeys, bourbons, etc. Never seen anything like that. Really cool. Then in the back it looked like a deli or meat case. I could be wrong but that's what I think I saw.  Then to the right is a long bar.  The menu looked really good. I was drawn to one of the \"Boards\" selections which was there House Ricotta. OMG! Homemade ricotta served with a bunch of different greens and radishes, etc. It also had ruby red grapefruit which caught my interest - I wish it would have had more or larger pieces to have added more of that flavor to the dish...but it was fabulous! We had a half portion which was only $14 and was a great starter for two.   My friend had the Pork Pappardelle. That is my favorite pasta but didn't care for the pork sausage ragu. I had a bite of it and the pasta was great. Sauce was fine. Just not my thing. My friend absolutely loved it! I had the Seared Scallops served with herbed risotto. OMG! Again! It was delicious.   I wish I hadn't been so full because I would have loved to have tried the Blackberry Panna Cotta. Service was fine. Slow start but once we mentioned we were still waiting things moved along. This was a lovely little place. I believe they have the farm to table concept...it certainly tasted like it. I will bypass Graze any day for this find! On top of this wonderful experience our total bill tipped a bit over $100 and included 4 glasses of wine and tip. Extremely reasonable for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"This is the best place in Madison to go for craft cocktails. I've loved everything I've had here. My favorite is their Moscow Mules. I highly recommend trying new things when you go here. They are pricey, but you pay for what you get. I've also been here for dinner and enjoyed my food."}
{"text":"I have to admit: I'm not quite sure why everyone raves about this place. The food is decidedly OK -- and that's it. I had mussels and a salad and both were not well put-together or seasoned. That said, the service was alright and the ambiance is great. I really hope the menu improves in the future."}
{"text":"Great classic cocktails and decent food.  I have been here a handful of times, mostly to drink and have got food the last couple of times.  It was pretty greasy and thought it was just okay but nothing spectacular, which is what I expected.    If you are around the capital and looking for a great cocktail loungue where you can buy the booze and ingridents used, this is the place for you.    Great atmopshere and by their cocktail making, I thought the food would be much better.  Still a great place to go for drinks but if you are going just to eat might want to pass."}
{"text":"On my most recent trip to Madison, we hit a lot of really good restaurants and bars, but Merchant Madison was easily the best of the bunch.  When I think of gastropubs, this is now the reference picture in my head.  Their bar is stocked with top notch imbibables, and staffed by bartenders that really know their stuff.  I went with the whiskey flights, but still got to sample a few cocktails that we ordered.  I'm not exactly a fan of the more-lively bars, but the drinks helped me care less about the boisterous crowd.  Our appetizers came out quickly, and everything was really tasty and expertly prepared.  When my Merchant Burger came out, I was really impressed at everything - it was a big ol' burger, all of the ingredients were farm fresh, the bun was impossibly soft and firm at the same time, and the burger patty was perfectly cooked medium.  I've had a LOT of burgers in my lifetime, all across the price spectrum, and this was one of the best.  It wasn't even all that expensive, compared to many other farm-to-table places, but the sum of all the parts made it one of my favorite burgers.  Our group was pretty unanimous about Merchant Madison - top notch, and will probably be the place we go back to upon future visits to Madison."}
{"text":"Hands down best food and cocktails I've had in Madison.  Try the hummus and the pork belly biscuit on the late night menu, and the house cocktails are inspired."}
{"text":"I'd like to echo a few things others have said first.  The seating is a little odd with the dining and bar area right together and the food is overpriced for how good it is.  The beer selection is average, as well as the wine list.    Here's what separates this place, the drinks!  The cocktails are the best I can remember having in Madison.  Although they are pricey $8-10, they're put together with great attention to detail.  The drinks are easily a 5 star.    I'm giving Merchant Madison 3 stars because everything other than their drinks is overpriced and average at best.  Go here for the mixed drinks-nothing else."}
{"text":"We went here last night with a group of friends for Dinner. We ended up waiting a half an hour for our reserved table. Once seated though we had an excellent experience mainly because of our Waitress Meghan. The food was good but on the pricey side, which we knew. Yet if it wasn't for Meghan's great service and fun spirit my review would be a 3.5 out of 5."}
{"text":"Merchant is one of my top 3 places to go to. All the bartenders make me feel welcomed. Two weeks ago was the first time I actually sat at a table ever. I always sit at the bar by myself or come dancing on the weekend to get loose. Haha. Serves was great but was longing to sit at the bar. Every time I go Something about the place makes me feel like I can wear my black beanie and \"run this world\"."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful late afternoon lunch...outdoor seating near the Capitol Square with perfectly hand-crafted cocktails. We particularly enjoyed the fried chicken and funnel cakes, which is an exciting new addition to the Madison scene.   Dean"}
{"text":"Normally Wisconsin was never on my list for \"places to travel to\", however since I came here for work I decided to check out downtown Madison with a coworker. We were easily able to get a reservation for 6 the day before and were seated promptly even though we were 30 minutes early. This is definetly one of my favorite restaraunts in Madison because the produce and meats are grown locally in WI. You can taste the freshness with every bite.  I tried the Pork Pappardelle which is a homemade papparedelle pasta, with Fox Valley Berkshire pork sausage & San Marzano tomato ragu, cherry tomatoes, house-made ricotta, Grana Padano, and green onions. WOW,I literally inhaled all of it within 5 minutes and wished there was more. Three of us got the pork papparedelle and we ALL LOVED IT!   We were so hyped on how deliciuos dinner was we had high expectations for dessert. When we asked the server she recommended the chocolate cake. I was so full from dinner that I didn't want anything, however when she said the chocolate beet cake was delicious I was game on! The cakes was a disapointment. It was a HUGE piece that was dry (which is surprising because isn't the beets supposed to make it moist), cold and I felt like someone just took it out the refrigerator and just cut it. I like my cake at room temperature or HOT! But we all learned our lesson, and next time I'll just stick to the entrees."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been there for fun, for our anniversary, and just recently used this venue for a small intimate baby celebration. They have always accommodated and adapted to my needs! The food can't be best, and the drinks are adventurous and amazing. Ask for Hannah as your server, she always delivers fabulous service on top of a great meal. Thanks merchant, and keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"They were busy so my daughter and I sat at the bar. That was great. Really nice people around us. I had a Bloody Mary (this was Saturday Brunch) which was excellent. For my meal I had coffee cake with a side of scrambled eggs which were cooked just right and served with an awesome salsa. I also ordered a $5 side of bacon which turned out to be ....one slice. But honestly it was more like smoked pork belly than a piece of bacon. Very rich. Fun and first class experience"}
{"text":"Went to Merchant for dinner tonight.  Ordered a well-done burger, as usual.  But what was really unusual was when someone from the kitchen came out with complimentary cheese curds for our table because we had to wait longer for the well-done burger.  That has never happened at any other restaurant we've visited.  Food and service were both great.  We'll be back for certain."}
{"text":"The cocktail menu is extensive. I had the steak and frites. It was very good but wasn't anything close to a revelation.   I'll definitely be back to dive deeper into the food and drinks menu."}
{"text":"Had better hopes for this place, it didn't deliver on my expectations.  -Pizole lacked flavor, it was very bland and lacking. -I misread and got smoked salmon cake benedict, wasn't too good. It was a bit much being on top of another muffin. Felt like this didn't need to be a benedict.  Overall this place wasn't for me, but it did seem pretty busy though."}
{"text":"Note to other recent reviewers: PLEASE only leave a review if you've actually been to this establishment. The point of this site is to leave reviews based on your experience there, not based on your politics.  Here's why I'm giving it 4 stars: Went there to \"grab\" a tasty treat with a limited time frame. Their sandwich area was closed, but the hostess immediately offered to go back and check to see if they could whip up a to-go sandwich order for me.  They even ushered me to a table and poured me a glass of water while I waited for my take-out order.  I picked the procuitto and arugula sandwich - very good, yet light. Ambiance is classy/romantic: think dimly lit, dark but modern woodwork, and an underneath the radar bourbon tasting in the corner to boot. Staff was friendly and extremely accommodating, even though I was in such a hurry.  I will definitely come back for a more substantial meal soon."}
{"text":"Merchant is a really special place. Very hip, and the food is absolutely fantastic, the staff is friendly, and the drinks are delicious.  The menu changes frequently, but if offered, I highly recommend the peekytoe crab rigatoni, the roasted beets appetizer, and the buratta.  My only complaint is that the management is a little lacking. One time, they lost our reservation, and another time, had to stand and wait for the host at the door for a few minutes. But both times, they made it right and were very apologetic."}
{"text":"The Merchant has great, creative food.  But my gripe's about their advertising.   I've been to the Merchant a couple of times for drinks and small plates.  The menu's kinda pricey, which is why I was really looking forward to trying their Cheap Date Tuesday-- advertised on their webpage as Two Entrees, Two Desserts and A Bottle of Wine for $40 (which sounded good enough to make me want to go out on a weeknight).  When we asked the server about it, however, it turned out that my date and I would be sharing one entree and one dessert.   For real?  Maybe it's time to update the webpage?"}
{"text":"Merchant serves up delicious, albeit somewhat pricey drinks.  The desert is also very tasty.  As a native Lexingtonian, I had to opt for the Lexington Belle, as I'd left my own Lexington belle back home in DC for the weekend.  This was the first cocktail I've had combining bourbon and ginger beer, and though I love both dearly on their own, I was a bit trepidatious given the strong flavors and aromas each carries.  The combination of the ginger and the high-proof bourbon with a touch of bitterness from the lime and bitters was very good.  The egg white gave a wonderful texture.  I would highly recommend it.  What I can't recommend, though, much less understand, is buying an of the items from the small grocery section of the store, as most are grossly overpriced."}
{"text":"In town visiting my son and taking in a Twiddle show.  Many places were closed and we happen upon The Merchant for Brunch.  Atmosphere is trendy, hipster, great music.  Really enjoyed the decor... would love to see Edison bulbs in the lighting!!  Men's bathroom could use some extra attention- TLC...  Food was VERY good.  I had the Merchant omelet, orange juice and coffee my son had the Two egg breakfast. Coffee was notably good!  Both of us had bloody Mary's.  The omelet was very tasty- sausage was great in the omelet.  Orange juice was fresh squeezed and tasted like it- delicious.  Bloody Mary was fantastic!  Celery salt rim, pickle, olive, lemon, lime it was not crazy strong- perfect. Mini 7oz Miller high life chaser was nice as opposed to a shot glass. This rating would have been higher, but the service lacked... considerably... while the server was pleasant when present... she was mostly absent... based on watching service at other tables and experience, this server either had too many tables or had little sense of urgency or timing- mind you we were not in a rush, but we ran out of water, coffee cups went dry and meals came out later than anticipated.  I did happen to notice she was working the outdoor table(s) as well... so while I am trying to defend and create excuses for her, overall service was poor.  I would definitely recommend this place to eat, and service by other servers at the place appeared to be good- I will not \"out\" this server in hopes that perhaps they may read this and have an epiphany- ironic as it is Easter Sunday...."}
{"text":"All the trappings of a Williamsburg, NY inspired craft food experience.   Craft cocktails, hipster chic ambience, wall paper, etc.   The food was quite good, the drinks were not bad.   For Madison, this place is a chart topper.     --  That said, I am about to pick on this place because it could be awesome, but makes a few errors that could easily be corrected.  1) The signage for the restaurant is  art nouveau which is incongruous for a place with a New American cuisine and interior, and it misleads some of the graphics inside the restaurant.  2) The Christmas lights in the windows gotta go. There are better ways to bring much needed attention to the windows without cheapening the rest of the investment in design.  3) The water bottles that sit on the table need to be changed out to something with a real vintage feel, it makes a big difference in the experience as they sit on the table for the entire meal.  4) The drink menu is a bit over designed, hard to use, and doesn't really tell me if I can buy the booze on the wall, which is a big miss for cross promotion if I can.  5) The staff tried, and are clearly trained, but need to keep training and being inspired to want to create the right experience.   Anyway, I enjoyed my steak and would stop back by to try the brunch next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Headed back to Merchant with a crew of 7 lovely ladies. I have to tip my hat to the wait staff. They know their stuff! Ask them anything about their extensive drink menu or food menu and they know the answer! Seriously, they describe flavors, make recommendations, tell you where things are from etc. It's borderline insane!   They are also all about the guest! They were happy to make me a custom mocktail, not on the menu, just something crafted just for me. Talk about feeling like a queen! They also let another in our group swap out a dessert special for an appetizer instead. Our server brought extra bread to dip into the sauce the mussels were steamed in. First class, 5 star service!  The food is also amazing! I sampled the perfectly seasoned fries, ooey gooey cheese curds, and couldn't pass up the warm olives again. My steak frites entree was amazing and cooked to perfection. Perfect crust on the peppery steak. Served with amazingly seasoned fries and a bed of lightly dressed greens. I sampled the date night fish which was also delicious and the perfectly citrusy mussels. That sauce... Oh that sauce! I understand why my friend ordered extra bread, it's drinkable!   Merchant is just one of those places that does everything right! Thank you to merchant and our stellar server for an exceptional meal!"}
{"text":"Eric is an amazing bartender. Have him make you a \"roll the dice\" cocktail - you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants to go to in Madison. Love, love LOVE this place. Their craft cocktails are awesome as well. Best Moscow Mule around!"}
{"text":"Merchant reminds us of all the great farm-to-table places we have in Central VA. The local ingredients were world class. The meat was especially impressive. Craft beers and wine list were really well thought out. I also noticed a local gin. Man, like I said, so much like Central Va.  It's great to see how much cool work is going on all across the country in small towns. Nick, our server, was knowledgeable and nursed us through a great experience. All the fine details and creativity were noticeable and much appreciated. Great job Merchant!!"}
{"text":"The Good: Fantastic service. We were on a time budget and called ahead to let the restaurant know. They were accommodating and genuinely respected our quick turn around. Bad service can ruin an experience - in this case it would made it. But to give all the credit to the service would be an injustice: delicious food as well!   The Not So Good: The lighting is dim past the point of ambiance. It was a struggle to read the menu.   The Highlight: I have since stopped eating cheese and literally dream of their cheese plate. I am literally jealous of anyone who can enjoy any of their delicious boards."}
{"text":"Horrible experience here! First restaurant I've been to in Madison where the staff were completely pretentious. Now that I think about it, they are the most pretentious people I've met so far in living here in Wisconsin. Everyone here has been so nice, which is such a change from Los Angeles, but the people from Merchant gave me a reminder of some of the jerks I remember from L.A. I was willing to look past this as long as the food was good. Isn't that how it usually works, you can be jerks because what you're offering is so good that people have to look past that? This wasn't the case. The food came out luke warm and not good. We had 3 different main courses all of which were ok at best. I've been so impressed at the restaurant selection here in Madison that it was a disappointment to have such an all around bad experience here. Save your money and go to one of the other 20 amazing restaurants in town. Walk down the street and eat at Sardine, 43 North, etc."}
{"text":"The best craft cocktails in town and awesome charcuterie platters as well. Beautiful ambiance and always polite service. Fun late night or good spot for a fancy dinner as well. Very hipster crowd that screams \"Madison\""}
{"text":"I've heard great stuff about Merchant so I checked it out with a friend and wasn't a fan. During the evening it's a perfect date spot though. I ordered their burger and fries and both were absolutely awful. I asked for my burger to be medium well and the cook burned the hell out of it. I asked for another one to be made and this time it was barely cooked, with blood oozing everywhere. So that was a no from me. And the dressing that comes on the burger is disgusting! As for the fries, they leave a bad aftertaste in your mouth after each bite and don't taste like fries at all. Simply put, these must be some sort of \"fancy\" fries because they definitely went out of their way to manipulate the taste. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I've been to Merchant once each of the last three years.  I've got to say, they're getting lazy.  Service was marginal on a not so busy night, food was meh.  Pork tenderloin was dry, pasta dishes uninspired.  Time to move on."}
{"text":"Craft cocktails, friendly bartenders and excellent appetizers. What more could you ask for? Their fries are excellent. I've had a few other small plates too, but it's the fries that I remember most. Go here if you are looking for a great drink during happy hour to start off your night right."}
{"text":"I'm going to start with what is most important: The Booze. I ordered a easy drink to start with, a Manhattan, and I tell you what----Whoa! Talk about feeling all warm and fuzzy right from the start as I downed this delicious liquor filled drink.  So what I've learned about Merchant so far: They do not skimp on the liquor in your drinks.  Ask for anything, they will have it.  So if you would like a great start of the night drink spot, I would suggest Merchant!  As for the food, I have briefly tasted appetizers and from what I've had---Great! Original taste and unique pairings.  The d√©cor is rather fun, sporting a wall of bottles of every type of booze you can think of.  Wait staff was awesome, and totally on their toes. What I enjoyed most was the fast that they brought water to the table in a fun chilled bottle and left it there as well. Very classy!  I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was average and the service was horribly slow.  10-15 minutes between wait staff visits is well beyond annoying."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour cocktails and homemade ricotta was like butter. Damn good! I'll have to try it another time for an actual meal."}
{"text":"The food here is spot on. I'd always thought of this place as the spot you go to at the end of the night to dance your buzz off, but after going on a whim for Restaurant Week, I now know the truth: This place serves great effing food.  Tuesdays are my favorite day to come. It's \"Date Night,\" and for $40 you and a plus-one can enjoy two featured entrees, a bottle of wine, and dessert. You can't beat that deal with a stick. The fun part (unless you hate surprises) is the fact that the featured entree and dessert are the chefs' choice. They're trying out new dishes that haven't made it to the menu yet.  Make no mistake -- this is no fly-by-night operation, and these dishes are damn good. Last time I went, we split an appetizer (elotes: Mexican street corn. Holy chit.) and enjoyed some pork belly entrees followed by Dark Chocolate and Cherry Custard. We were both VERY happy campers. And I scored major points with my hot date for the suggestion (it must've clinched the deal cuz we're still dating lol).  Another standout thing about this place? The liquor menu. It is, quite literally, a book. I'm not a huge wine person, so I opted for the mystery drink option. Choose your spirit (I chose Irish whiskey), and for the base price of the spirit chosen +$4, the bartender will mix you up something lovely. Mine came back in a lovely tumbler-ful melding with Chartreuse, orange oil and some other citrusy/herbal bitters. It was heavenly.  The wait staff are SUPER awesome. They're friendly, patient when explaining the meal, how stuff works, etc, and they're also the perfect balance of not-hovering-but-right-there-when-you-need-something. Kudos to the crew!  And let's not forget the dinner and dessert chefs -- I dunno who they are, but I wanna shake their hands -- they do a beautiful job.  A couple practical bits: 1. Bathroom: clean one-holers that are out-of-the-way and private. 2. Parking: park in the garage across the street (next to the Great Dane). There's also on-street parking all over, if you can snag a spot."}
{"text":"Update: Returned for dinner on a Saturday night. I made reservations this time around.   The flatbread was incredible - I've never had anything quite like it. Two members of my party had pasta dishes and both options were refreshing rather than heavy. They were happy with their pasta  -  I was happy with my flatbread - and we were all happy with our bottle of wine."}
{"text":"If you want to enjoy some well-made cocktails in a cozy, upscale atmosphere, then Merchant Madison is the perfect place.  It's one part liquor store, one part music venue, and one part cocktail lounge that also happens to serve delicious food.  The cocktail menu is impressive  Drinks are listed by spirit and the selection is massive(it was practically a book!). I sucked down quite a few of a tasty concoction named 'The Regret,' which featured Death's Door gin or vodka (I opted for the gin), fresh lime juice, and rosemary. It was a most delightful libation: clean, crisp, and citrusy. (And the name is spot on; I experienced my own \"regret\" in the form of a mild hangover the next morning.)  The cocktologists were all friendly and hipster-y, in their knit hats, looking like they participate in Movember year-round.  MM has nightly specials like \"Wine and Dine\" on Wednesdays, and \"Burger and Beer\" on Mondays. Plenty to like about this place, and I haven't even tried the food yet.  Looking forward to working my way through all the inventive cocktails. Good thing several more trips to Madison are on the docket."}
{"text":"I went here with a group of 7 on Saturday night as this is one of the few restaurants downtown where you can make a reservation.   While the menu can seem small and a bit pricy, everyone in the group loved their meals. I got the pork pappardelle, and it was worth every penny.   I don't usually order dessert, but we decided to go for it and got the flourless chocolate cake. It was very rich chocolate and had a very pretty display on the plate with raspberry and orange. Too bad I didn't take a pic - would've made a good instagram. 5/5 would order again.   Service was good and they leave big bottles of water on the table so you can refill your cup. One thing to note- with a group that size, 20% tip is included in the check (although they give you the opportunity to tip on top of that...)"}
{"text":"Second tier only to Heritage and Graze.  Mussels were 5 star, the fries that come with the mussels are definitely 5 star, Pork Pappardelle was 4 star. The atmosphere is very trendy, I agree. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Best food you've ever had in Madison? Really?  I wanted to like Merchant. I did. I dine on the square a fair bit and as far as I'm concerned, the more options the better!  However, the space feels very much like the restaurants I took great pains to avoid when I lived in L.A. (because they were too much of a scene). It's smaller, but I get the same negative vibe.  I've seen a large bar share space with a dining area and work very well (Bar La Grassa in Minneapolis, for instance), but Merchant just feels cold to me -- warehouse-like. Like a bar that serves some food, as opposed to a restaurant that encourages you to eat at the bar. The waitstaff seemed very aloof on both of my visits, and charging $9 for cocktails just tips the scales further towards pretension. Maybe hanging some art would soften it a bit? And hiring some nicer people?  I sampled the craft cocktails and was left wanting. Same with the food. Maybe I'll try it again in a few moths and hope they're able to make some improvements, but they've quite honestly not given me much of a reason to give them another chance.  *** This review has been edited from it's original content. After my initial (frustrating) experience with this establishment, I decided to give it another try and re-write the review with a clear mind. Unfortunately my second experience only echoed my initial let down."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place!! We were quoted about 45 minutes to an hour when we originally arrived so we found a seat at the bar and waited. About 20 minutes or so into waiting our table was ready, which was great! We started off with the Ploughman's Board and this is a MUST! It was so delicious. A nice mix of meats and cheeses, as well as honey, pickles, pickled tomatoes (i think - they were delicious whatever they were) and bread. We could have stopped there, but had to try more off the menu. For my main, I had the moules frites and my fiance had the chicken. His was super tasty! He received both white and dark meat and nice brussel sprout veggie mix on the bottom of his chicken. I love my mussels, the sauce was super tasty and I couldn't resist dipping my bread; however, the frites were almost fried to nothing. There was no potato left on the inside when you would bite into them. I love fries, and typically will eat them right up, but they were not very tasty! They also have a great cocktail and wine list. If we come back to Madison we will definitely be coming back to Merchant. Great restaurant downtown!!"}
{"text":"Okay Merchant, you're up to bat. Several Yelpers highly recommend you so we showed up with high expectations. Specifically we heard a rumor that the buffalo style cheese curds were incredible. Were they?  We showed up to Merchant around 8pm for a slightly later dinner than usual. It was quite packed and loud by the time we showed up. The host was sitting and disengaged, but he was able to have someone seat us immediately at a 2 person table wedged in the corner by the kitchen.  The decor can be described as a pirate ship cabin that has been redecorated by a hipster. The walls have fleured wall paper and the light fixtures remind me of something out of Pirates of the Caribbean between the paper lanterns and the lamp covers made out of old carboys with the bottoms cut off. Even the drink menu had an old canvas map feel to it. The entire north wall is lined with craft liquor for sale, which is nice because sometimes you just need to run out and get a bottle of Pastis but can't find it in a liquor store. I'd describe the atmosphere as a very trendy, kind of hipster bar. Unfortunately, it is quite loud so don't expect to have a good conversation inside.  During our visit I had the opportunity to order a fantastic porter that was on rotating tap, the buffalo style cheese curds, the Friday night special (fish fry), and a key lime pie.  Let's start with the cheese curds; I was sorely disappointed. The cheese curds were fairly standard but when ordered buffalo style they come with buffalo sauce DUMPED all over them. The first one I put in my mouth honestly reminded me of a buffalo boneless chicken wing, not a cheese curd. The breading was mushy, and you couldn't really taste the cheese. We were so disappointed by the addition of this sauce that we ended up asking our server for a cheese curd without it on the side. The curd without the sauce was quite good. We're going to have to come back again to truly get a feel for the curds at Merchant because we cannot judge them on their buffalo style curds. If you really want to try the buffalo curds, ask for the buffalo sauce on the side.  Merchant also offers a HUGE list of craft cocktails. My wife ordered the Lee Ralph, a rum and fruit based cocktail. It was quite smooth so much so that it didn't taste alcoholic. If you're a Yelper, make sure you check in to get $1 off the cocktails!  The main course, my fish fry was very well done. It was fresh water perch, served with a house tartar sauce. I do not really like tartar sauce so I can't say much about the sauce, but my wife said it was really good. I ended up asking for a bottle of malt vinegar, which is the only way to truly eat fried fish, in my humble opinion. The fries that came with the meal were VERY salty, but the acid of the malt vinegar paired well, toning down the salt. I really liked the coleslaw, surprisingly. I'm not the biggest fan, but this slaw was very good. It entirely lacked balanced by having tons of vinegar on it, but it paired well with the salt from the fries. I actually liked the overpowering acid in this case.  For dessert I ordered the key lime pie. I'm a bit of a key lime pie snob, and this pie has HUGE potential. The filling was incredible, and it had the right about of whipped cream on top. Sadly, there was way too much crust on the pie. The ratio of filling to crust was weighted toward the crust. There should always been more filling than crust. Either the crust needs to be thinner or the filling needs to be thicker. I don't want every bite to taste just like graham cracker.  The service at Merchant was fantastic. Our server was very attentive in refilling water, asking how things were, and asking if we needed anything like more drinks. She even took care of my ridiculous requests for a single cheese curd and a bottle of malt vinegar. Merchant, kudos on quality service. We felt very taken care of, even when I was being slightly ridiculous.  I also have to mention, Merchant, props on your wine list. It is rare to see such a diverse, interesting, and well put together wine list. It's even rarer to server so many of the wines by the glass. I appreciate this touch.  Overall, I really liked Merchant. It had some short comings, but I think I will be a repeat customer. We need to give the cheese curds without sauce another try and explore more of the menu. It pains me a bit to only give Merchant 3 stars because I want to like it. I appreciate the atmosphere, menu diversity, drink quality, and the service. I cannot over look all of the small flaws in the food. The food left me wanting a little bit more."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a drink with friends. We stopped here before dinner.  I really appreciate that the bartenders take the craft cocktail business seriously without the attitude. The bartenders are super friendly and fast. Our bartender made a perfect martini -- he even asked me if I wanted it stirred and exactly how much vermouth. The result was awesome. Merchant also keeps their martini glasses in the freezer.  I would probably not eat dinner at Merchant given the noise factor. The bar got fairly crowded and was rambunctious at times. Trying to have a dinner for two or something might be kind of tough. But for drinks, or a casual dinner, Merchant delivers."}
{"text":"The food was disgusting. I ordered a burger from their lunch menu. The meat was gray, it was rubbery, as if it was cooked in a microwave. They served it with burnt fries that were so salty and some sort of dipping sauce that tasted like mayonnaise.  My mother ordered a salad with apples, it was OK, but a lot of the lettuce was wilted. My father ordered some sort of fish, it was over cooked and dry. When I asked for a refill on my soda, the waiter rolled her eyes. Not only is the food horrible but so is the service. I will never go here again."}
{"text":"I appreciate their creative drink menu and their commitment to quality ingredients and inventive dishes. I ordered the barley bowl to feel better about spending a bunch of money on drinks, but I would make that decision again even if it were the same price as the duck. It was SO flavorful and hearty. I loved it.  The service was very knowledgeable, funny, and attentive and the atmosphere was sophisticated."}
{"text":"Finally, a restaurant/bar that makes some great cocktails! Very few restaurants carry the Maraschino liquor, but Merchant does, and they know how to mix good cocktails with it. The food's quite good as well, but heavy on the cheese, which I don't like. But you might like it.  Also, it seems that Merchant is being the target of a smear campaign. Before listening to the naysayers, keep in mind how several of them have made zero contribution to Yelp so far, and just registered to slam a business they dislike."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came for Sunday brunch on a day trip to Madison with our four-legged fur baby. The weather was perfect so we sat in their outside section. We were the only people with a pup there, but the staff was accommodating - they brought her a bowl of water and checked in on us (her), so I assume they're used to it.  We ordered a couple of drinks to start - a rose for me, and my boyfriend had their bloody Mary. It was honestly one of the better bloody Marys I've had, even in a state that's well known for their over-the-top bloodys. They didn't go overboard with the garnishes, but there was a perfect balance of booze and spice and it wasn't too heavy. I would absolutely order that the next time we're in for brunch.  For brunch, I had their french toast. It was absolutely enormous, covered in ricotta and berries and was delightful. I wish it came with some sort of a side to break up all the carbs, but man was it good. I'm not one to take pictures of my food, but I couldn't resist with this one.  Merchant is pricey for Wisconsin, but right in line with more upscale dining in Madison. We each had a drink and an entree and got out of there for about $60 including tip. Fair warning: the outside area is small so if you're looking to seat a big party out there when the weather is nice, show up early and claim your spot!"}
{"text":"The environment is nice and the cheese curds are on point. A bit pricey for what you get (drinks wise and food wise) and service is a little slow. Went 3x in the last week...same experience all times. BUT the cheese curds at 5stars for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Merchant just for cocktails and an appetizer. We ordered the mussels, which came with a mild cream sauce with (I think) shallots, and some excellent bread. It was excellent. I ordered a whiskey sour (made with an egg white), and my wife had something Manhattanish. All was superb. We'll be back."}
{"text":"We had the bisque soup and Farro pasta.  The soup could have used a little more flavor but the pasta was excellent.  Great ambiance although too dark - and I'm still in my 30s...  I had to use the flashlight on my camera to read the menu...  Great spot though!"}
{"text":"SO good. Cheese curds here are great if you like more cheese than batter (YES)! We also got the merchant burger, which was cooked well and had delicious fried green tomatoes and jalapeno jelly which was surprisingly good, and the steak frites. The steak was very flavorful, well marinated and served with shallot butter (amaze).I never got a steak knife, which was strange, but luckily I didn't need one as the meat was juicy and prepared well. The fries are also SO GOOD pro tip ask for the aioli but maybe skip dealers choice for the drink special because you may just end up with 2 shots of brandy in a glass. Unless you're maybe into that."}
{"text":"The Merchant was as cool as we heard it would be on the inside. Very hip and modern, and extremely clean. We had been warned about the limited menu, but were shocked at how limited it was! My fianc√© and I are not ones looking to pay over 20 for a single meal, so our options were limited to burger or pasta, which gave about 5 options total. We choose both pastas to split, and both were very tasty! My fianc√© got an old fashioned and I got the whiskey sour for drinks. They were pretty strong. The drink menu is much larger than the food menu, it for sure seems more of an upscale bar than a dinner spot. Great service tho!"}
{"text":"I have tried to love The Merchant however I have been there 3 times and each has left me with one of the worst dinning experiences in my 15 yrs of living in Madison.  Terrible service seems to be the primary driving issue for this trendy spot.  My first negative experience at Merchant was when I inquired about vodka and if they had any corn or grape based vodka.  The bartender immediately gave me a lecture about how the grain of vodka wouldn't impact me because it's distilled and it doesn't matter what grain is its base.  Though I understand the science behind that mentality my stomach and celiac disease would say otherwise.  But 1 bartender will not keep me away from awesome craft cocktails.  My 2nd experience at Merchant was last summer after a walk around the Square we stopped for an app and some cocktails.  As I went to pick up my glass of water the bottom half of the glass broke off and the entire glass of water spilled in my lap.  Being slightly drenched and alarmed the bottom of the glass had just broken off we told our server.  Her response was \"oh that happens sometimes\".  WHAT?!? You have glasses that sometimes break off on your customers??  No apology or any bit of friendly customer service was given to rectify the situation.  It wasn't till the neighboring table mentioned hey I believe you might want to comp her cocktail did the server even appear to be phased by the fact my shorts were soaking wet and I was less than pleased.  By the time we got our bill and left there was no visit by a manager or apology for what transpired.  It took me a whole year to return.    So yesterday since Marigold Kitchen's line was so long we took our chances and visited for breakfast.  My husband ordered a cocktail & then we ordered food.  The bar had 6 guests and overall the restaurant had just a handful of tables.  Boy were we surprised when our meal arrived prior to his drink.  When we inquired about it the staff member stated it takes awhile to make cocktails.  A simple \"sure let me check on that for you\", would have sufficed.  Our server paid us little attention as she chatted at the table right next to us of her girlfriends.  When we were brought the bill there was no pleasantries or asking if we enjoyed our meal which was less than satisfying for the price.  In the end Merchant has had our last dollar.  Despite having delicious cocktails and an awesome ambience I can no longer look past the repeatedly rude service they have.    I have been in the service industry for 15 years and we eat out all the time, the Merchant sets the bar for some of the worst service I've ever seen."}
{"text":"It was a busy Sunday evening with all the Epic people arriving, but they handled the crowd well and the food was great. My Coho salmon was memorable. Many places to dine in Madison, but this place adds an electric atmosphere like no other."}
{"text":"I had dinner with a friend at Merchant last night for the first time. It was a fantastic experience on all levels! We were happily greeted and got a table right away. We really appreciate that they use food from local sources as much as possible. And our server, Emily, was lovely & informative giving us helpful ideas/info. I chose the Deaths Door Vodka on the rocks (smooth with notes of vanilla) and my friend had the Pisco Sour - both were amazing & the real deal - we were seriously happy girls.  On to the food! We started with the roasted beets with bleu cheese & hazelnuts. They were incredible - a well rounded dish offering equal parts warm/cool, soft/crunchy, sweet/acidic. Side note:  I don't even like bleu cheese and it was creamy heaven. For a main course, I ordered the Atlantic Salmon. It was truly the best salmon I've ever had - tender fish with crisp skin & perfectly seasoned with hints of lemon/fennel served with an amazing array of vegetables in a light, but flavorful buerre blanc sauce. I actually asked for a spoon to get more of the sauce (as I figured putting the plate up to my face would be considered poor form).  My friend had the Mozzarella Panini with pepper jam and arugula which was also crazy delicious and well balanced - I would absolutely order that dish in the future. We had no room for dessert, but I look forward to that next time.  Give Merchant a try - it's my new favorite place!"}
{"text":"Birthday dinner was great for restaurant week. There was a small kitchen smoke fire at the end and our meal was free what was even more great was they called to apologize and offered an additional  restaurant week the following week. Great service tasty farm to table food and a wide variety of delicious cocktails to choose from. Service is great food is great ambiance is great this is one of my favorite restaurants off the square in Madison."}
{"text":"Anyone who is into cocktail culture should plan a visit to Merchant.  The talented bartenders put on an entertaining show as they concoct an amazing variety of specialty drinks.  If you can, grab a seat at the bar and watch the magic happen.  We stopped in for a nightcap and ordered a couple of glasses of fruity red wine and a slice of the decadent flourless chocolate cake.  In the 45 minutes or so that we sipped our wine, I don't think I saw any of the four bartenders make the same drink twice.  The made everything with a flourish and lots of crazy shaking, straining, stirring and twists. It seemed every specialty drink had its own unique glass and the guys wasted no time in their work.  Come for a drink and be prepared to be entertained- these guys definitely know what they are doing."}
{"text":"Nice feel to this place. Had some great drinks here with friends. I always judge a place by their Bloody Marys and mine was bloody good."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and had a wonderful experience both times! The first time, I came here for dinner as a school assignment. The owner came to our class to discuss his creative work/entrepreneurial process behind the restaurant + it was very cool. The second time was for brunch.  The concept is farm de table in terms food and drinks. There's a large drink list, all with fresh locally sourced ingredients. During my second visit (Saturday brunch), I got a Bloody Mary and my boyfriend got a mimosa and they were very SO good! I like that they give you the option of having the bloody spicy bc I like it hot! The mix was unique and very fresh.  In addition, the food was very fresh and tasteful as well. During my first visit, I ordered the pork pappardelle, which was very rich and flavorful. The second time, I ordered the breakfast burrito for brunch and the dish was just as good.  I like merchant because it has a very unique atmosphere. You can tell that there has been a lot of thought put into the decor + that the staff are very knowledgable.   Overall, merchant is a wonderfully offbeat joint to get farm de table food."}
{"text":"Went here on NYE for a light dinner.  Agree that this place is LOUD.  Dark, too.  I ordered the butternut squash/apple/nut soup, which was really good at first, but after a while, I just felt it was too salty.  Companion had the seafood & linguine dish, which was OK.  I had the hummus plate as an appetizer.  Hummus plate was good; served with toasts.  Worst thing about this place was the noise and the crowdedness.  Two people decided to sit next to us in the bench next to us and they were occasionally making out. My companion said that he felt kinda like he was making out with them because he was sitting so close to them.    I might go here for lunch when it's less busy, but not for dinner again."}
{"text":"Kinda the old kid on the block as it relates to craft cocktails.  Approachable drink menu and the mixologists are always willing to make special request.  The food is sometimes hit or miss so I usually focus on the drinks and get my grub somewhere else."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had and we sat at the bar.  We were told we could not have their drink special, because \"it wasn't ready\". It was all booze they had behind the bar.  The drinks we did have were very overpriced for what you got.  Can't comment on the food, but they sure didn't try to win us over. Too many quality other places to go in the area!"}
{"text":"Can you give six stars? I'm giving six stars.  If you ever meet me, you'll know within an hour that merchant is one of my favorite restaurants I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Everything about every meal and drink I've had here has only been positive.   To start: service is always top notch. Chefs and cooks are competent and accommodating; if you have any questions about diet or ingredients, servers are always willing to find out for you. Speaking of servers, ask for Kristin if she's available. I wish I could give her a review too, but I'll just say, most honest, competent, and one of the best servers I've had the pleasure of being served by.  In my last review, I went into deep detail of every meal I've had here. Overall, I love the mussels here. Decadent, creamy (no dairy!), almost tart perfection with mussels and onions cooked just right. Mussels weren't my favorite food until I came to Madison.  Drinks; I've had many and let me say, they're all amazing. Go with your gut; if you think you'll like it, you'll most likely love it. My favorite is the sharknado, and pear's sake is a close second. Desserts; red beet chocolate cake, hand's down. It's a large dessert, so I definitely recommend sharing.   Surprisingly, I've never had to wait for a table. Most of the time I have a reservation, but the few times I've come here without one, I've been seated within ten minutes. I can rave about this place all day, which i do to many of my out-of-town friends. Come here for a drink ($2 off for happy hour), or come here for the fun servers and the good food. You can bet you'll run into me here!"}
{"text":"Just came here in the evening so not a review about food. It was an alright experience. The decor does look more upscale and classy than an average bar. There was a live DJ but the music was very strange that evening (so there were not many people dancing). The bar area was very crowded and it was difficult to be seen/get a word in edgewise. This was a recommended place to us as a \"go-to\" on State Street, but besides this, not much to say. SO say drinks are very very strong."}
{"text":"We stopped in for couple of drinks last night, the wife had the shark-nado a spicy blend of sweet and rum. I had the sazerac cocktail a nice lightly sweet bitter drink served up, very good considering I really only drink whisky neat. I really like the ambiance with the menus labeled hunger and thirst."}
{"text":"Very cool place with a laid back vibe. We came around 7:30 pm on a Tuesday for dinner service and were seated at the bar since there were no tables available. It worked out great, since it allowed us to strike up a conversation with the bartender. Dude was real cool, very friendly and willing to describe the cocktails and make suggestions to us, though I regretfully didn't catch his name.  I ordered the \"Sage Advice from Nicaragua\" - an herbaceous take on my go-to whiskey sour. It was excellent; the sage flavor was very subtle, just enough to set it apart from other sours I've had. My boyfriend ordered the \"Sweater Weather\", a tequila-based cinnamon-scented cocktail served warm, which he said he enjoyed. I considered ordering a second cocktail, but I was already (shamefully) feeling the effects of the first one.  For dinner, I had the Merchant burger and my boyfriend had the mussels. The burger was a good, solid burger: buns were soft and buttery, patty cooked medium like I requested, but I wasn't wowed by it. The fries were legit, though - super crispy and perfectly salted, my BF and I demolished them. He really liked his mussels and I have to agree, the broth was superb. Highly recommend getting the large order, a mere $4 more than the \"small\", so that you can share!  Merchant is a lovely restaurant with a casual atmosphere despite the upscale decor. The host was friendly, the bartender even more so, and the drinks were on point. Guaranteed to be a wonderful evening if you're in the downtown area."}
{"text":"If I had more money, I would probably spend most of it on Merchant. I love Merchant. Merchant reminds me of those higher-scale Chicago craft-cocktail bars, so if you've ever been to one of those (think Violet Hour, Big Star, Small Bar, etc.), give Merchant a try.  Prices make this a once-in-a-while, special-treat kind of place for me, but the drinks are some of the best on the Square, the atmosphere is relaxed but still cool, and the food is delicious. Although, full disclosure, anywhere that serves aioli with their fries is already at least a solid B+ in my book. (Another plus: I have yet to see a bartender at Merchant that is NOT super-attractive. So.)  I really liked the service here, too - our waitress seemed very knowledgeable about what went into everything on the menu, but she also kept things very down-to-earth and less formal than I would've expected, which was nice. She was also very attentive and upfront about their gluten-free options."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on Saturday afternoon after the farmers market. I've been to Merchant a few times before in the evenings for dinner and drinks...and while I think their food and cocktails are overpriced, they are delicious, there is no doubt about that.  When we went in after the farmers market, the restaurant was only half full. We ordered a few drinks to cool off. It took 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive-- if the restaurant was busy, I would understand, but it was not a busy situation. The strawberry lemonade my sister ordered burned because there was not enough sugar, it was straight lemon! Our waitress was nice but after we had finished our drinks she was slow to get us our check.  If I would go back I think I'll stick to dinner at the bar and hope for quicker service."}
{"text":"Winter cocktails have been updated recently, and as always they are a treat. After the Women's March on Saturday we stopped in and I ordered \"The Carmen Sandiego\" -- smokey, luxurious, and you don't have to answer geography trivia in order to savor it. My girlfriend had \"Breakfast with Champions #2\" and enjoyed it. My own drink had so completely blown my tastebuds away I don't think I could actually taste the nuances of her drink when I tried it.  Also, there might be something wrong with me because I literally never order any other food here besides the fried chicken sandwich. I no longer bother chewing it. Like Japan's favorite pink ball of fluff, Kirby, I simply open my mouth and inhale the sandwich, plate and all, into my waiting, quivering food sac."}
{"text":"Extremely loud, no matter when you're there. If you can get past the loudness of this place, their food and drinks are decent."}
{"text":"Dined with a large group here on Friday night. Merchant is a hip farm-to-table restaurant that also specializes in mixology. I started with one of their summer cocktails, the Sharknado, a drink made of rum, rum and rum. And some grapefruit juice. The drink was served in a kitschy shark mug which I loved. There is a limit of only 2 Sharknados per customer and for good reason. This drink is strong but refreshing. If rum and shark mugs aren't your thing, there are plenty of other cocktails to try as their drink menu is extensive (60+ pages!). The food is locally sourced and the menu changes seasonally. We had the chance to try a variety of the appetizers and boards. The cheese curds were perfectly fried and the buffalo version was tasty although most of the diners at our table preferred the non-buffalo version. The boards included a variety of cheeses, meats and vegetables. Our server, Kristen, who was excellent, knew all of them. I can't remember any of them...just that they were all good! The house made ricotta on the spring radish and ricotta board was outstanding. I had the steamed mussels for my meal. I was surprised how creamy and light the white wine broth was. Delicious! My husband enjoyed his scallops Proven√ßal as well.  The table shared a variety of desserts. I am a huge fan of crime br√ªl√©e and Merchant's orange blossom version did not disappoint. The red beet & dark chocolate cake was moist and rich. The dark chocolate & cherry custard was also a hit. The rhubarb dessert was a tad undercooked that night but that was the only miss of the night. There are not a lot of tables so I recommend making reservations.  The restaurant also has music later in the evenings. And, if you need some liquor, beer or wine to take home, you can buy from their liquor store!"}
{"text":"Love the craft cocktails menu here at the Merchant. The bartenders are extremely knowledgable and create amazing drinks. I also would try their cheese curds which are as big as golf balls. All of seemed to like our food, but the waitress was a little slow. None of the service staff has real uniforms so it is tough to identify your server, and our server was slow.  However, the food was incredible and drinks were fabulous."}
{"text":"very nice and modern place.  high end ingredients. nice brunch and high quality products for food and cocktails.  average prices for brunch.  comfortable settings and location next to capital.  service is excellent."}
{"text":"Welcome to yuppie central  Food is good, drinks is good, atmosphere is dark - that's good. This place is good for a date but the cocktails are 10 bucks a pop at the very least. It can get kinda loud on the weekends. Get the fries"}
{"text":"Upon returning from San Francisco expectations for restaurants were high. The Merchant didn't disappoint. Amazing food, beautiful presentation, creative cocktails, and all at a great price. Oh yeah, it's local food too!"}
{"text":"The drinks and food are amazing. I had the squash dumplings twice now and both versions are SO good. Healthy comfort food has been created!"}
{"text":"A good Caipirinha in Madison Wisconsin?! That's exactly the type of reaction you should have at Merchant - one of the best cocktail bars I've ever been to. In the WORLD. It's mostly because the cocktails are inventive, tasty, done right and also super reasonable. The quality of drinks here would be $15 - $20 in NYC, London or Toronto, but instead they are a nice $9 or $6 during HH.   I came on the recommendation of a friend who raves about the bar. She was spot on. The bartenders know what they're doing and can make you anything you want. The cocktail list is exhaustive, so here are some of my recommendations:   - Para Todo Bien - who knew Reposado and maple syrup were a duo?   - Reconstructed Cup - a Pimm's Cup without all that British dry bitterness  - Yerbatero - Caipirinha with Yerba Mate syrup takes your taste buds for a ride  - Bartender's Choice - whatever they feel like making you, or what you want. It turns out I told them that I love St. Germain and Aperol, which ended up being the Champagne Cola on the menu  I'd recommend checking their Facebook/Twitter for specials. We happened to miss the $3 punch on Mondays. The punches were pretty epic and bubbly, exactly what I love!   I give it 4 stars because the food was so-so, unfortunately. Burger, salad, mussels, tartare, uneventful. The cheese curds were better than average, and massive. Like big pillowly hockey pucks of cheese. My advice? Eat at home, and come here to get your Don Draper drink on!"}
{"text":"The quality of the food served is top notch, but the menu isn't entirely inspiring. While the drink menu is robust it seems overly complicated. The beer listing is on page 36.    I ordered the brat sliders. This said this was one of three burger/sandwich type options. The brat sliders came on little pretzel roles  (2 per order). You get a choice of sides - salad, fries, or soup. I had the salad - nicely dressed with a vinaigrette. The addition of mustard to the brat sliders jazzed up the taste profile.    The place is sort or dark and noisy. I'm not a spry barely consenting adult, but I'm not an old codger either and I found it very hard to read the menu. It was noisy enough that conversation was a bit challenging.   I'll likely go back. Maybe explore the 40 page drink menu."}
{"text":"Best mussels in Madison.  Seriously the best mussels in town. I have tried them all. Great service, and great ambiance."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers in town with out question!  It also happens to be the coolest place in Madison, by far the best crowd of young attractive professionals dancing and mingling. I don't go out very Saturday night but if I do its here."}
{"text":"It's really hard to get a drink here on a Saturday night.  That must mean it's good, right?  With a little patience and persistence you will eventually get your beverage.  No worries.  They have a tiny dance floor but the DJ was rocking...old and new school hip hop and pop...my favorite dance music!  We had a few minor incidences of crowding and overzealous college students sloshing beverages on adjacent dancers but no worse than any other dance place, and better than several I've frequented.  They list themselves as an industrial-chic gastropub and that description is apt.  Suspended, open glass cylinders with bare bulbs inside light the dancefloor area, lots of dark wood.  Trendy.  Hipster.  But in an inviting way.  The crowd was a good mix of young and old(er) when we first got there before 10.  Most of the old(er) crowd slowly trickled out before the DJ got jumping.  Even so, I didn't feel awkward there the way I do in some places downtown.  I'm almost 39 but I LOVE to dance!  They have a single seater women's restroom, a single seater handicap/women's restroom and a multi seater men's room...I'm guessing a urinal or two and stall?  More women's restrooms would be nice.  Especially when two friends camp out in one to chat and apply makeup.  Come on ladies, some of us gotta go!  The Wilson street ramp is just across the street so if you can't find street parking that's always a good option.  They serve dinner nightly and brunch on weekends.  I haven't tried the food yet but I just might give it a try!  If and when I do, I'll update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"Just stopped for drinks and was VERY IMPRESSED!! Hipsters abound, but they make a great drink and are a hoot to hang with. GO THERE."}
{"text":"Fun place. They take their cocktails seriously, and they are very good, especially old classics like the Whiskey Sour and the Sazerac. Menu could be bigger, but it's creative nonetheless. Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Whisky Sour and French 75 hit the spot. They do not skimp on their portions. Fantastic make of the drinks!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place. Fantastic drinks, reasonably priced for their high end ingredients. Very knowledgeable bartenders. Good thing I'm only here for a few days or they'd have to name a stool after me. Try the Sazerac! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"They're definitely on the pricier side for Madison as drinks are ~$10, but they are usually worth it. They do have really friendly bartenders and have music on weekends, which is a ton of fun if you want more of a club-y feel than Plan B or Sotto."}
{"text":"So a review of Merchant is difficult because the spot wears two hats:  Merchant functions as a great restaurant by day. Locally sourced food that is interesting but focused (eg brunch menu is very farmtable oriented). I think this place has the best drinks in town, hands down. It deserves five stars based on that alone. The bartenders are thoughtful and deliberate with each drink they make, and each cocktail is unique and intentional in its flavoring. Big fan.  Late night, Merchant turns into a club. If I were basing off this alone, we'd probably go with 3/5 stars. Gets crowded, loud, and pretty obnoxious with the young professional crowd (I have been a fufiller of this stereotype more than once). But overall a good time; and hey, they still serve those drinks."}
{"text":"Ordered the pork chop tonight. I feared it would come out overcooked; I needn't have worried.  It came out raw.  Sent it back; 10 minutes later it came out raw again.  The server graciously agreed to have it taken off the bill and get the manager. When the manager came over, she greeted me by saying \"So what's up with the pork chop?\"  Not I'm sorry. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  Definitely wouldn't eat here again!"}
{"text":"Top 3 highlights/lowlights  1) excellent service 2) gluten free options available 3) breakfast cocktails   Came to Merchant for brunch on a Sunday. We did not have a reservation (this is recommended!) but we were seated right away at the bar. The menu has a variety of items and offers gluten free bread for toast/sandwiches. I had the breakfast sandwich on gluten free bread and really enjoyed it, it came with a salad which really balanced everything out. The menu also had several specialty cocktails (as you expect here!) and the service was excellent."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed the food and the ambiance. I gave it 4 stars because the sitting is too tight. I don't want to hear other people's conversations.  Nice place overall."}
{"text":"After dining at Merchant several times, I find it to be more stuffy and loud than trendy and fun. Though I tend to enjoy the food at Merchant, I find that my experiences there are more stressful than relaxing. The restaurant itself is quite small and often packed, especially on weekend nights with the bustling bar crowd and young professional diners. Tables are too close together, which makes it hard for servers to get around, and the sheer noise in the restaurant makes it hard to hold a conversation with the person in front of you.   Service itself is spotty, and I have had experiences where the dish I ordered didn't make it to my table. It probably has to do with the frenzied atmosphere and cramped space.  In general, the food, especially the bar bites, are tasty. They do have great cheese curds and lamb burgers. It's quite expensive though...I would say overpriced for the amount of food you get.   However, if you don't mind crowds and a lot of noise, and you want a hip place for drinks, it's a good option. If I returned, I would probably stick to sitting at the bar, and just order the curds and a drink. I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic dinner or an event where you really want to maintain conversations with those around you."}
{"text":"Great craft cocktails and tasty food. I like that Merchant successfully does like four or five different things. It's a brunch spot, a market, a craft cocktail bar, a sexy place to eat, and (on weekends) a dance club. Merchant is hip, fun, and creative. Excellent choice for out of town guests and showing off what the Madison food and drink scene is about."}
{"text":"I liked the decor and atmosphere a lot.  It was loud, but lively and warm. We didn't have a reservation, so we got seated in what turned out to be not such a great table.  It was really close to the bar.  Our server-- who was very nice and clearly well-trained-- tried to make some room, but we just sat on the same side.     Cocktails were fine.  You can tell they're trying hard, but the results were nothing to write home about.  Cheese curds were good-- I would say above average, with a nice light batter.  My wife ordered scallops, which were served with swiss chard and some nice crusty bread ($26).  This included three scallops (medium-large, but not enormous).  The sauce really added nothing to them.  Not a bad dish, but really kind of bland and boring.  My wife thought that they were tasty but overpowered by salt.  I thought that they were just boring.  I had the pappardelle ($19).  To be honest, it kind of sucked.  The proportions were off (oddly enough, not enough pasta and too much sauce) and the sausage that they were using seemed to be high-quality, but ill suited for the dish.  It was bland when it needed to be robust.  It came with what seemed to be  a huge ball of ricotta, but it seemed to just melt in and away quickly, adding very little to the dish.  On the whole, this dish  really could have used some more flavor, if even just some more salt.    So, in sum, an utterly mediocre and forgettable meal for far too much money (total with three drinks and tip was just under $100).  I highly doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"As a self-respecting recent college grad I have a reliably fantastic drink which I turn to in times of celebration, distress, relaxation, etc. etc. My drink is the '59 Sound at Merchant which combines tequila, fresh lime, housemade basil-lemon syrup, honey, and celery bitters to create a drink you simultaneously want to take home and propose marriage to.  The atmosphere at Merchant is great for a quiet dinner but gets rowdy on the weekends (we're talking booty-shakin' dance club, oh yeah!). The fare is expensive for a college budget but is well worth it for a nicer evening out. Last week my sister got the house-made pasta with sausage ragu and fresh ricotta and still won't shut up about it."}
{"text":"Thoughtful, inventive food and cocktails to die for.  I love the vibe of this place."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Merchant on my first trip to Madison and I loved this spot!  The food and drinks were excellent, the service was great, and the space was modern and fun.  I loved my Moscow Mule cocktail, the cheese curds were amazing (get them with both the ranch and hot sauce on the side so you can experience both flavors!), the olive appetizer was good, and my pork paparadelle was absolutely delicious!  The service was quite good, and we appreciated the fact that the waitress was very patient and came back multiple times to take our order, since we were yapping away and took a while to decide on what we wanted.    The restaurant is centrally located, spacious, and was packed on a Tuesday night.    Great spot!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere in here is great- it has that California industrial look but doesn't feel overdone, or pandering.  In fact, it is laid back.  The Monday burger and beer deal is great! ($28 for a pitcher and two burgers).  The burgers are very very good, and they have a good selection of beer.  The cocktail list looked well thought out too. The burgers also came loaded with fries :)"}
{"text":"Possibly some of the best bartenders in the city, and they don't short you on their pours.  On the late night menu, I only sampled the tri tip steak tacos, which were well seasoned, but the meat was tough.  Last suggestion, stay away on weekend nights unless you are a \"coastie\" with Daddy's phat no limit credit card.  You've been warned."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the high prices, I would be going to Merchant every week. Their unique take on simple meals is delicious and exciting--highly recommend."}
{"text":"While the food and the cocktails (very strong) were really good the service was horrible. Our server blamed it on being understaffed in the kitchen but we sat there, without our food, while people came and went. Our server was perfunctory in her duties - she gave us free drinks and despite it being only one of our birthdays she threw in free desserts for everyone. Now that sounds great, but she was standoffish and condescending. We watched as she was friendly and interacted in an animated way with other patrons but basically ignored us the entire night. Merchant has good food and a solid craft cocktail menu but their service left A LOT to be desired."}
{"text":"This is a really great spot for enjoying a date night or just winding down with friends for a good meal. When arriving downtown, we parked in a lot and then walked over to this restaurant that sits on the corner.  Our waiter, Nicc, was awesome and gave us great recommendations for some of the fall cocktails. I had the wanderlust and it was very tasty. My husband ordered the Shepherd one which was our waiter's favorite and it came in a little cutesy glass, which my husband made fun of, but he also really liked the drink. The cocktail book has great descriptions and it's fun to go through and read about the drinks.  For starters, we got the Ploughman's charcuterie board and there were multiple cheeses, meats, pickles, nuts, etc. The cheeses were good and my favorite was the goat cheese. There was some aged ham on the board, but to be honest, it didn't taste of anything special--it could have been Hilshire Farm for all we knew. The local honey and variety of mustards and the crostini was also good. For our meal, I had the pork pasta dish with homemade pasta. The portion was perfect and the red sauce was divine with just the right amount of acidity. The fresh pasta had the perfect bite and was cooked just right. My husband had the lamb sliders with a side of fries. What really made the slider awesome was the pretzel bun. It was a good slider and the meat was moist and well seasoned. The fries were good, but a little on the salty side.   Service was attentive and dishes were taken away promptly and our waters refilled. We loved our experience here!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times for drinks and twice for dinner.  Quality of food, drinks and service are terrific. I've become hooked on their whiskey sours, which they make in the classic style.. with an egg white.  Yep, that's right kids, whiskey sours should have an egg in them, which gives the drinks a frothy top. Delicious (and healthy?? Probably not, but I like to tell myself that ;)  Dinner here is good, but it gets so darn loud.  Nothing they can do about it, because the dining area is just one big room and when it's packed, people's voices carry from other tables and the bar area.  I felt like I had to yell at the person across from me to have a conversation.  Not a huge deal, but I've decided it's better to come here for drinks at the bar rather than eat at a table."}
{"text":"I have been to the Merchant on three different occasions. One just for drinks, one for dinner and one for a combination of the two. The first two visits were fabulous.   The first time we visited with friend for drinks, the bartender was friendly and engaged us in conversation around the cocktails and ingredients. Sitting at the bar, we were able to see the bartenders skillfully creating a variety of drinks.  Very fun.  On the second visit, I was with colleagues. I ordered \"the regret,\" a drink with lime juice and Death's Door vodka. Yum! I also ordered the beet salad with pistachios. Double yum!  The third visit was last night. Not great. The maitre d' was very nice, but placed us in the \"lounge.\" This area was next to the bathrooms and the kitchen doorway. We were told no one would come through the kitchen door, which opened directly into the middle of our party of six . Several kitchen staff did come through and until finally one staff member brought us shots (yuck) to apologize for the inconvenience. We refused the shots, but he said he needed one and brought them anyway.  The location did garner some amusement as the bathroom locks did not work, and patrons were  constantly walking in on each other. The bathroom signs (symbols?) also brought some confusion as to which gender was to enter which room.  The reaction to the food was mixed. The beet salad was good. The pork belly sandwich was burned. Fries were good. The cheese plate was okay. The blue cheese was served cold, so it was crumbly. The waitress let us know we could get more bread for the cheese plate. We hunted our waitress down and requested more bread,  but by the time we received it, we were ready to leave. The waitress also asked for our credit cards before we saw our bill, which was strange.  The drinks on this occasion were a hit. We had \"regrets\" all around (in more ways than one) and they were tasty. I still think this is a great establishment, but I would recommend sticking to the drinks and sitting at the bar."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and so is the staff. Their drink menu is the best in Madison. They had taken one drink that my boyfriend LOVES off the menu but with the help of a friend who works there they were able to make it for us and I got to surprise him with it for Christmas. We also ordered a charcuterie cheese board and I'm pretty sure they gave extras of everything. And the atmosphere is amazing. I'm in love with Merchant."}
{"text":"Local food on the menu \"farm-to-table restaurant\", in addition to one of the best cocktail menus I've ever seen makes this place wonderful.  If you are a person that appreciates these elements you won't be disappointed.   Be warned the cocktails are about 15 bucks a pop because it's premium liquor."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place yet? I've been here multiple times on Work trips and loved it every time.  I've gone for dinner by self, dinner with a group, and just drinks with a group. Every time they nail it right on the nose and the food and cocktails are delicious.  Make sure you try the steak here - every time I get it it's made to perfection and it comes with a side salad!  Overall this is one of my favorite places to go. I have never heard complaints and everyone I've brought has enjoyed this restaurant.  I love asking whoever is taking my order what to get because"}
{"text":"I dined her for Restaurant Week because I thought the menu looked fantastic. For $30, you got an app, entree and dessert. Add a class of wine (limited selection) for $7. Overall, great price. For my app, I ordered the Butternut Squash soup which turned out to be one of the best soups I've eaten. It was amazing. For my entree, I had the steak frites. Steak was nicely seasoned, flavorful and the fries were perfectly crispy. Toe end the meal, dessert was ice cream s'more. The gram cracker was flakey and complimented the dish very well.   So, all be told, overall the meal was good. Where Merchant loses points are the following\":  - Slow Service: our dessert was melted by the time it got to our table. The waiter clearly forgot about. She approached our table and realized we were without our dessert. We had waited a good 10 minutes for it to arrive. Realizing it was a little bit busy, I blew it off but c'mon... we had ice cream brought to us melted! Ruined the moment.  - $4 for ice tea that does not come with a refill! WHAT?! $4 for water with a tea bag in it? Stunned! My BF asked for a refill. I guess I should thank the waitress for letting us know that refills were not free. I have never dined at a place where A) refills were not free besides booze of course, B) you paid $4 for some damn ice tea. I asked my BF if the ice tea was at least good. He said he has tasted much better.  - Tight places: table are too damn close to each other. Hard to hold a private conversation. One of my, if not thee, biggest pet peeves I have with some restaurants. Not matter how good the food is, if I have to basically share table space with other diners, I will not be pleased.   I am not sure what to make of Merchant. If you're a drinker, you will love Merchant as their alcohol selection is virtually overwhelming. There is a drink for you somewhere in the 15 page book of booze. Food wise, there are better options in WI that support locally owned farms and businesses.    Sorry, I just cannot get over the fact that ice tea is $4 and does not include refills. At least have ONE free refill. I am truly shocked that Merchant apparently thinks is OK. You almost feel robbed. That alone would make me not want to come back. It is just.... well... wrong."}
{"text":"Having lived in Madison for a few years now, I realized the other night I have never eaten at Merchant; I've only drank there. Merchant is perfect for the first drink of the night or the last drink of the night. I would vote that it is perfect for the first drink of the night as it tends to become very packed as the night goes on. I started my night there around 9 pm last Saturday night and it already was shoulder to shoulder in there. I did manage to find some standing room around one of the bar tables to enjoy my drink. Every time I enter Merchant I have the intention of ordering a new seasonal drink but every time I end up ordering 1 of 3 standbys- The Aviation, The Bees Knees, or The Regret.--and each time I never regret that decision. The bartenders are good-nay-great at what they do. The other staff seems might aloof when asking them questions or for help navigating a spot to stand/get a drink. Will I be back? Duh."}
{"text":"I came into Merchant for a late dinner on a Friday night.  I was staying at a hotel around the corner and walked over around 8:45 pm.  It was rather busy and in the midst of transitioning from restaurant to bar.  Fortunately, they were able to seat me pretty quickly at a small table so I could order some food before the kitchen closed. I ordered the cheese curds after reading in other reviews that they were great, and the waitress suggested I get the \"buffalo\" version, so I went with it.  I also ordered the pork pasta that I can't remember how to spell, along with the seasonal version of an Old Fashioned to drink.  The first negative was that the pasta came out well before either the drink or cheese curds.  The pasta itself was good but nothing to write home about.  The cheese curds were actually quite good, although I think they may have cooled down after being buffalo-sauced, as they weren't very hot when they made it to me.  The drink seemed awfully small/weak for the price tag, but it was a nice compliment to the pasta.  I would love to go back to Merchant again when the kitchen wasn't just about to close and try something a bit more adventurous on the menu."}
{"text":"I was in Madison visiting family and made two trips here on the weekend. They serve late night food and bring in a DJ around 10:30 to spin some alright stuff. Friday night was better for us as he was spinning mostly house. The dance floor gets rowdy and the place gets pretty packed at night so getting to the bar can be slow, but the cocktails are worth it. The Aviator, Sazerac, etc are all good. If you can grab a table lining the room, a waitress will stop by and serve your drinks.  With the DJ comes a fairly young undergrad crowd, so if that's your scene I recommend this place. We ducked out after a while and hopped around the square...   They're also host to Madison's Best Bartender as voted somewhere..."}
{"text":"I really like Merchant! I've always had excellent service, especially when sitting at the bar and everything new I've tried there has been between good and really, really great. Try the mother's ruin, its my fave.  Be sure to check out their specials when you're in, they've got a lot of good deals going on for cheap yet classy nights out almost every night of the week and they host cozy music performances quite regularly."}
{"text":"What a great place!!  I love coming back to Madison after a few years since I graduated and its cool to see that there are new restaurants opening in the area which are totally not what you would've found back 10 years ago.  Merchant is a perfect example, a place made for foodies where food, drinks, decoration and music blend perfectly.  I had to say that I had been drinking all evening by the time we got here, and what a perfect combo after drinking local Wisconsin beers to come to this place where mixologist craft the most delicious drinks in the area.  As for the food? We were not that hungry or perhaps we didn't want to kill our buzz, so we ordered a charcuterie plate (delicious), an octopus salad and bone marrow (probably my favorite).  The place gets very crowded after 10, so be aware of that and reserve a table if you are planning on dining here."}
{"text":"Fabulous cocktails and amazing food.  Can't wait to go back next time I am in the Mad City."}
{"text":"My bartender, JR...not sure what it stands for but \"Jolly Right\" would be my vote because he is an amazing mixologist, very talented and recommends just the right drink.   After running 13 miles, I decided alcohol and salmon were calling me. This place has an extensive cocktail menu, complete with (not bedtime) stories and history. Great touch. I decided on Chulman's Space Punch because punch just sounds fun and it includes rum and everyone loves rum. Served with a massive cinnamon stick and star fruit, honey and Duquesne Rhum (fancy word for rum), i was hooked. Could have had two, but held back.  JR recommended a simple arugula salad and I needed some protein. He said I could add salmon for $4. What...maybe two bites of salmon? I was skeptical. When the salad came, it was an entree portion. Surely, the rhum was playing tricks and he said $14...Outstanding salad. The bill came and there it was...$4 for the salmon. I could not believe it. It was like winning the WI fish lottery.   Great spot; hang at the bar. Met a nice couple and we chatted about cocktails and their talented daughter, a budding photographer. Look forward to coming back in September."}
{"text":"Something you don't experience at most bars. Ordered well drinks a few times and then asked for a Long Island. Well drinks were 4 dollars . When I asked for 3 Long Islands the bartender said verbatim \"I've got to warn you before I pour them we don't have bottom shelf and they are 14 each\". Instead of paying 42 dollars for a round of drinks at 2 am which we probably didn't need I paid 12 for the same delicious drinks we had all night. Tom, the gentleman pouring drinks, could have easily made 3 times as much but was super nice about it. First yelp review because this was such a nice, refreshing experience."}
{"text":"One star rating based on hostess alone.  Made a reservation on Open Table.  Show up and check in 10 mins before my 7:30 reservation for 3 people.   Hostess can't find my reservation and I show her my reservation on my phone which happened to be for the following weekend.....   Oops. Totally My bad.  but the hostess was completely snotty when I asked how long it would be for a table. She said at least an hour with an eye roll and hair fluff.  The place was not even half full!  No attempt was made to accommodate us or say we could sit and wait at the bar (where I have eaten before).  My bad for making the reservation on the wrong day but surely u want business??   Instead we went across the street and were completely made welcome by their competition."}
{"text":"Knowledgeable hipster bartenders slinging excellent mussels and delicious cocktails. Getcho cheese curds on!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give more than 5 stars. This place was amazing. By far the best cocktails I've ever had. A bit pricier than I'm accustomed to paying for a cocktail but well worth it. We will definitely be back again to try more. They've got a great drink menu but the bartenders do an amazing job of making recommendations based on what you're in the mood for, especially when that mood is \"a perfect cocktail\" kinda mood."}
{"text":"I did not have dinner here, but rather came at night when the DJ was going strong and the crowd was happy to dance. Great craft cocktails with a really happening scene. I hadn't been to Madison before my trip here, and I was surprised by the hip ambiance. My only suggestion for improvement would be to open the kitchen later for those of us who might get hungry after a few drinks and a lot of dancing!"}
{"text":"Never had their food (heard good things) but love their cocktails and it's a great/chill date vibe before the late night crowd shows up."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I are from Louisiana so we take food seriously! This place was AWESOME! The atmosphere was fantastic and the food was delicious! We attempted to order cheese curds as much as possible in Wisconsin, and this place was our favorite! They also had, BY FAR, the best French press coffee we had on our trip! (Yes we had cheese curds and coffee). I had the Steak and Eggs which were cooked to perfection, and my fianc√© loved the Croissant Breakfast Sandwich he ordered! I'm so glad we strolled by this place!"}
{"text":"To be honest this place didn't blow me away, but it definitely wasn't bad either...it's a nice ambience and atmosphere, and I would definitely recommend people to try it - I just didn't feel like it was that special.  In an age where farm to table food is super popular (especially in Madison), I feel like you need to taste great and have great prices/ambience to excel (like Graze). Merchant falls short in both categories. It was definitely good food, just not a huge stand out.  Their drinks are a bit above average, but we had pretty slow service. The food was good, just nothing to write home about. All in all, I recommend checking this place out if you want a decent fancy meal but have already tried the other great places in town and want something new!"}
{"text":"Great for cocktails, particularly when you can sit outside in the summer. The food is a bit overpriced, but the Pork Pappardelle is very good. Skip brunch...nothing great and kind of depressing to sit in darkness mid morning. Their snack menu features several delicious things, but not at all worth the price. I can only really recommend Merchant for drinks. They have dancing on Friday and Saturday nights, but a really spotty crowd/DJs. Since there isn't much competition in Madison for dancing, this is an ok option. They have a decent \"Cheap Date Night\" prix fixe on Tuesdays. I find the concept of a \"date night\" pretty depressing, but it's a good deal."}
{"text":"Husband and I celebrated our anniversary here for lunch and were quite impressed with the drink menu.  He ordered an old fashioned sour- which was excellent in my book.  He was quite impressed too!  I ordered this delicious drink \"La Paloma,\" and I would rate it an A for presentation, and an A for taste.  The atmosphere was quiet and cozy and the rustic, boho feel was a nice place for conversation.    The food menu didn't start until 3:30 and dinner menu at 5:00.  Thankfully we were there for a late lunch and our drinks and conversation held us over until we could order.  Our server was very pleasant and let us place the order slightly before the 3:30.    We gave the cheese/ meat board a try.  I would give this selection a B- for its effort.  Its obvious the food is local and fresh, the meat was excellent and the portion you get is worth the money.  The cheese was ok, nothing to write home about.  However, half of the tray is full of RAW pickled veggies.  Now don't get me wrong, I love veggies, but there were too many.  It overtook the board.  The jam and honey were excellent additions with the bread. Mustard was an odd selection for this board, we couldn't figure what it would go on... the bread?    It was just a weird combination overall.    We were excited to hear that there is Tiki Tuesdays and asked to order one of the tiki drinks and we were told they didn't start serving them until 10PM.  We were bummed because they were cute, served in a coconut mug!  Unfortunately, I am sleeping at 10PM on a Tuesday night, as most nights.  That was disappointing to say the least.    We might be back for the drinks....maybe...."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Merchant and thought it looked stylish & trendy. Good atmosphere with reasonably priced, strong drinks. Very busy on a Friday night.  At 10pm, DJ took over playing great 80's & 90's music. Lots of college kids getting their groove on.  Enjoyed people watching!  Really fun time, but skip the shrimp tacos. :)"}
{"text":"We only came in for a couple of drinks during our Madison visit, but I keep thinking about this place weeks later! The decor is great, the servers are uber-hipsters, but not the stuck up uber-hipster kind...actually way friendly. The fact that it is a liquor store is great. The drink menu had long fun descriptions of all the drinks that made me think just how perfect this place would be if you were grabbing an afternoon drink alone. I wish I could have read the menu cover to cover! The drinks themselves were so delicious, with riffs on what you would expect and then some wild things thrown in there. I didn't have any food there, but will be the next time I come to Madison."}
{"text":"Some people like dancing there. I felt weird about the size of the floor, some pillars or columns in awkward places, and the odd DJ at the time. That was years ago so who knows how dancing there is now.   That said, the drink selection is vast and fun to go through. And I overall like, not love, their food. They know how to make and remix prohibition cocktails, which are some of my fave drinks ATM, so very pleased to drink there. They do the thing a lot of places do of having it be very dim or almost dark, and I just can't a place that does that very highly."}
{"text":"Best place to eat in Madison. Great drinks, food, and service. A must visit."}
{"text":"Love the HH cocktails! You cannot just have one!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and drinks with knowledgeable staff. It is an expensive place to be, but is worth it."}
{"text":"While the decor was pleasing to the eye, the service and food quality left me wanting more  After catching a show at the Majestic, the wife and I dropped in to Merchant for a drink and a light meal. Our first impression was positive - the setting gave off a hip but friendly vibe.  After a short wait, our server came by and took our drink order.  She seemed rushed and wasn't all that helpful recommending a selection from the wine list.   While the bartender provided us with a generous pour, neither the Domaine de Oritoire Le P'tit Cotes du Rhone nor the Shannon Ridge Sauvignon Blanc left much of an impression.   After receiving our wine and ordering the daily flat bread special, we did not see our waitress for 30 minutes, so there was no chance to replace the drinks with another selection.  While the flatbread sounded tasty, it was poorly executed. It was generously topped with goat cheese, bacon, asparagus and shallots. Unfortunately, crust was bland tasting, too thick and became soggy from supporting all of the toppings. Another complication was the ginormous size of the toppings (whole strips of bacon and thick spears of asparagus) which made the dish difficult to consume.  Crumbling the bacon and cutting the asparagus to bite sized pieces would have allowed a better balance of flavors in each bite. While I L-O-V-E roasted shallots, these were undercooked and lacked the sweetness found in properly caramelized shallots.  Due to the open floor plan, it was difficult to carry on a conversation due the excessive noise level.   While I love the vibe given off by Merchant, the level of service and the quality of food left me unimpressed.  In the future, I'll be more inclined to go to Graze or Johnny Delmonico's rather than return to Merchant when in search for a late night snack."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by for restaurant week, and it was a hit!  Off the restaurant week menu, I had: the radish&ricotta salad, the BBQ pork shank, and the raspberry gelato&fresh fruit. Merchant also offers their restaurant week menu a la carte, so the three of us shared an order of the steamed mussels.  Appetizer: The bacon bits on the radish&ricotta salad was a nice surprise! I'm not typically a fan of radishes, but I loved how the radishes were coated in a light dressing and then sprinkled with bacon and paired with fresh strawberries. Such a refreshing combination! The steamed mussels were also delicious, especially with the white wine reduction. I thought the mussels were a little on the small side and kind of dry, but they were definitely very enjoyable when paired with the white wine sauce.    Entree: Don't be fooled by the size of the pork shank. It doesn't look like all that much food, but trust me, it is more than enough to satisfy even the most voracious of appetites!! The baked pinto beans and the sauteed collard greens were also delicious and provided a nice complement to the pork!  Dessert: I am glad I chose the gelato for dessert (to share!), it was a great palate cleanser and a nice, light way to finish off an otherwise heavy meal. :)  Cocktail: I also had the kohana hana cocktail, per recommendation of our server.  It came served in a lager bottle, dressed with a tiny orchid. I love it when my cocktails have a little bit of flair! ;) I loved the fact that she knew right a way which ones to recommend when I told her that I wanted something more tangy - that's how you know that they really know their stuff! I definitely think I will be trying the 'Not Yet 25' at some point in the next few weeks, since I only have 28 more days where that drink will actually be applicable.  Dining at Merchant was overall a very pleasant experience. I'd definitely recommend it for a nice evening out!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful dining experience on a Sunday night. Blissfully unaware of why there were throngs of people down town; I find out that there is an Ironman race going on and it takes at least 12 hours to finish... as I am sipping my Humuhumunukunukuapua'a cocktail and savoring the delectable Lamb sliders. Thank you to my lone dining neighbor from Chicago, Nadine, as she was waiting for her friend to finish the race, on educating me to the details of the Ironman triathlon. The Lamb sliders are a definite must eat. Don't taint the slider with ketchup or any other kind of sauce. It is wonderfully season and delicious as is. I got the side salad with a lemon vinaigrette and it was a nice accompaniment but really wanted to try their fries but I was being good... dammit! The Humuhumunukunukuapua'a cocktail was delightfully refreshing and rummy. A little lilikoi powder on the rim and this would transport you to the Islands. I had the roast chicken next and it was wonderfully moist and tender inside and a crispy skin outside. I wish I could do this at home... how?!? The sprinkling of collards were perfect and would have liked more instead of the fingerling potatoes which were equally yummie but again trying to avoid too much starch and I love collards. I finished it all off with the flourless chocolate cake. I was a little disappointed since I usually have it room temperature. This was fresh from the refrigerator and too cold. It would have been much better room temp to really taste the chocolate and not have to break off hardened bites that have their essence of chocolate locked away in the chill of the cake. Unfortunate :..( The other misstep or oversight was sitting waiting after being seated for a wait person to acknowledge I exist. It was quite the pause to the beginning of dinner. And, it wasn't due to the place being packed as only a couple of tables were actually occupied. Overall a nice place to eat. I would skip the chocolate cake if it is always served chilled or have them warm it up."}
{"text":"It's a solid place to catch a bite to eat or a drink at the bar."}
{"text":"Went to Merchant twice this week.  I like the idea of the urban grocery, and that they sell most (all?) of what they use in the kitchen.  The design of the place is very de rigueur for restaurants these days; tall, open ceilings with a very gastropub feel and an attempt to be warm & modern with upper-middle class pricing...but also a little loud.  I think that Merchant fits most of these except the design seems a bit more confused to me.  That may be due to the fact that they're trying to squeeze three things into one, but other similar places you'll find more attention to detail in terms of tying the place together.  This is just the first week or so of its evolution though, so I'm looking forward to seeing what they do.    The kitchen looks very nice, though it also seems like a crowded place to work in.  It's nice to see that they didn't skimp on things like an overhead hood that other restaurants have left out in order to save costs.  The kitchen seems designed well enough to get the food flowing out in an orderly manner too.  Again, something you don't always benefit from  in Madison.  The silverware station creates a chokepoint near the bar which will be annoying for servers and bar patrons sitting near there.  The bar and lighting is nice, but the lighting is a bit bright for the kind of drinks they're serving and the thing they're obviously going for---a return to older mixologies with modern speakeasy twists.  The bathrooms are nice enough despite a decidedly Georgia O'Keefe take on Paisley.  The first time, a group of six of us went over for late night after work.  They had stopped doing food, so they brought out some complimentary fennel carmel corn and roasted nuts.  This was a nice touch, but the fennel is completely missing in the carmel corn, so I would just change the name entirely as to not mislead people (or use a lot more fennel).  The roasted nuts were pretty tasty, though a lot of the spices fell to the bottom of the bowl.  It was a nice find at the finish though!  Since we were there for drinks, I looked over the menu and here's what I found:  1)  A solid beer list, but sadly, only a few on tap.  The bottle list makes up for this in variety, but the pricing here is out-of-control in places.  For instance, a bottle of Bell's Two Hearted is $5.  I can get a pint of Two Hearted--cheaper--at a couple of nearby establishments.  Needless to say, I will never be drinking a bottle of beer at Merchant.  I drank a couple of Bells Double Cream Stouts, which were good, but I hope to see them try a lot of other options here too.  Central Waters' Bourbon Barrel Stout is amazing, for instance.    2)  A solid wine list with someone behind it who has done their homework in terms of where to source each varietal from.  It's true that one can find hidden gems everywhere, but this wine list gives anyone who chooses to drink wine a very intelligent and researched selection.  Each selection is not the finest one can find from each region, but it's nice to see an informed wine list and it stays within reason on pricing.    3)  The mixed drink list is impressive and everyone I spoke to who was drinking one (and I tasted them all too) was happy.  The Last Word, The Judge, The Last Pale Light In The West, and The Brass were all very good drinks.  Of course, there are those drinks that seem to be on every similarly-themed place's menu these days (Sazerac, Corpse Reviver No. 2) as well.  I like that they've got their approach to an Old Fashioned as well as a \"Wisco-Styles\" option.  It seems very fitting, and I'm sure each variation is equally tasty.  The service was very good, helpful and accommodating for a group of people who came in relatively late for some drinks and to check the place out.  The bar also did well, despite having a \"learner bartender\" at the helm.  All in all, a very satisfactory adventure.    My second visit was for dinner.  The staff seemed a little overwhelmed by everything just looking at how things were flowing, but that's normal for a start-up.  Actually, we were seated quickly, and our server got us rolling with some drinks.  For starters we had two of the toasts (truffled white bean, ricotta & pine nut w/smoked trout) which were very good.  The sunchoke risotto was missing something, but tasted very nice if you got every ingredient into a bite.  The brussels were amazing!  The bucatini w/sausage was good but a little oily and similarly lacking an ingredient to tie the dish together.  The beef bourguignon was good, but not spectacular...though it was my favorite entree.  Nice knife work on the vegetables too.  Overall, a good dining experience, but I'm waiting for 'the' dish that brings me back there.  Our server was working his first night (hired on the spot even), and he was great.    I will be back for sure, and it's honestly between 3 and 4 stars, but I went for 3 since I'd like to return after they've had time to sort things out and to hone in on everything they're trying to do."}
{"text":"Was terrified to fly to Madison Wisconsin because you know Coastal bias and fear of the unknown! This place definitely quieted my fears with their artisanal cocktails that I thought I could only get at speakeasies in my believed DC! They have the delectable menu explaining each cocktail and liquor history for those less in the know like myself.   Try the chameleon witch if you're into creamy and melt in your mouth that sneak up on you because they're so good you forget you're drinking too notch booze.   Try the cheese curds and the lamb sliders. And please come get me in Boston and take me with you next time you're headed to Madison!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience. Thanks Nathaniel for the amazing service. Try a brandy old fashioned to start. I had two! The cheese plate followed by the butter ranch salad was a perfect start. Kev had the veggie option and loved it. I had the fish fry...perfect! We finished by sharing the chocolate-beet cake. Sounds odd....was amazing......moist, not too sweet. We will definitely be back the next time we are in Madison."}
{"text":"I used to like the drinks and food here a lot, but I just went here yesterday, and they've changed everything up. The cheese curds are horrible -- they have a TON of flavorless breading all over them that masks the deliciousness of Sassy Cow's cheese curds -- so they are just bland. We also ordered the patatas bravas, which had a good flavor, but they were extremely greasy in a way that detracted from the food. I would give the experience one star, but the drinks are still good."}
{"text":"I came here for a cocktail before dinner. I liked the atmosphere, music and bartenders were good.  I left to have dinner at another location. I think I should have just stayed at Merchant Madison for dinner.  After dinner, I went back for an after dinner drink. Perfect.  Next time, I'll try the food."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! The service was phenomenal too!  Starting out i ordered a cocktail (warning: I'm not much of a liquor person) and my fiance ordered a beer. The cocktail was super strong and not really  my deal. After a while our waitress asked me how it was and i told her it was too strong for me and she offered to take it off the tab for me! I couldn't imagine anywhere else offering that.   Buffalo style cheese curds were absolutely amazing -crunchy, gooey/cheesy and delicious ranch.   Steak frites -- cooked amazing, delcious fries to go with it.   Bison burger was on point. Fiance said it was the best burger in Madison he had!   Dessert was the panna cotta and it was a special treat. Pears were delicious and the crumble on top  made it that much better!   Overall, the atmosphere was on point, food was suberb and the wait staff was attentive."}
{"text":"I recently went back to give this a place a second try and it was well worth it. I'm only rating it a 4 as I have only eaten here once. I will definitely try again and if I feel it's consistent, always great food and great service I will then rate it a 5. So for the 4 star rating......we went on a Friday night. It wasn't super busy as was the last time we tried to eat here (graduation weekend). We did however have a reservation and I do recommend you make one. We first started with some drinks, I had a Chardonnay and my two girlfriends had Martinis (which I tried and they were wonderful). We ordered two appetizers. One was the Charcuterie and other was classic cheese curds. Both were very good. For dinner we each ordered an entree plus one to share.  I had one of the pasta dishes, Tagliatelle w/ scallops. Pasta is made fresh everyday so was very light and good. The dish itself had great flavor. It did have sugar snap peas which are not my favorite but actually complimented the dish very well. I ate everything but a few peas. :-). Our server recommended for me to add scallops to this dish since I love scallops and that was the other dish I was going to get. They were very good. As for my friends, they had Pork Pappardelle and Fox Valley Berkshire Grilled Pork Chop. We shared the Steak Frites. The steak was pretty good and would probably order that if I come back. Oh and the French fries.....Amazing!  I couldn't stop eating them. Haha. So onto to the service, her name was Kristin and we loved her. She was so genuine and easy to talk to. Always made sure we were taken care of and that we liked what we had. I would like to request her again when I return. I was also told that after dinner this restaurant has a DJ starting at about 1030. You could spend your whole night here and never have to leave. We ended up leaving after dinner to meet some other friends at a different place. They also have an outside area that is probably around 6 tables. Don't quote me in this as I'm guessing :-). I did take several pics of our food which I'll post."}
{"text":"Business owners always ask me the secret to 5 star success and frankly, it's hard to sum up in words. How do you explain to someone, \"Be really great at what you do... like better than everyone else.\" Lucky for me, I can use Merchant as an example.   Here's a great story about a place that knew it needed to make some changes, listened to feedback and implemented what people were saying and made smart decisions to the menu that keep me coming back.   I went tonight with someone who said, \"Merchant... really? I was there a year ago and it was sort of a mess, but if you vouch for it, I'll try it.\" He loved his rigatoni, I loved the hangar steak (cooked perfectly this time around) and we were both uber pleased with our server Lauren who made incredibly strong drink recommendations. It was awesome to hear her passionately describe two of her favorites, and we decided to get 'em both. The Fire & Wine includes a fun table side presentation that I won't spoil, but suffice it to say if you enjoy warm winter drinks, you need to get this.  Lauren was also super willing to ask the kitchen if they'd swap in the patatas bravas with my steak instead of the mustard mashed taters which are a little too creamy for me. They did, and let me tell ya... this needs to be a thing. Medium steak seasoned perfectly atop crispy potatoes with a zippy little aioli... it's like a Spanish version of steak frites. Super good. And I really appreciated that they were willing to make the switch.   So, in conclusion, when people ask me how to rock that 5-star review, I'll simply link to this one. And I'll happily return to Merchant with people that were once turned off by it as long as they continue to grow, evolve and kill it! (Which they totally are.)"}
{"text":"Delightful. I liked the decor, felt homey and a warm use of textiles, glass and wood.   The radish and sourdough board was good and I ate it as my dinner. I also had a good taste of the burger and it was more tasty than I've had in a long time. Blue cheese not over powering and you can add a fried egg!  So so good. Duck confit was fantastic.  Very pleased with our waitress. She was engaging and helpful answering my questions about the cocktails and size of plates."}
{"text":"I'd give it 3.5 stars. The charcuterie board was amazing! The drinks, while tasty, have very little alcohol in it and are very small for the $12 you have to pay. The food was solid.  The Moules Frites could use a couple pieces of crusty bread to soak up the delicious liquor left over after the fries. The Chorizo Sausages and Jalepeno Corn Fritters were good, but the fritters were rubbery.  The service was spot on. I'd go here again to try something different, but would get drinks elsewhere first."}
{"text":"Merchant was hands down a solid choice for brunch in Madison. We were in Wisconsin's capital for a wedding the night before and wanted to hit up brunch with the crew that morning. As busy as brunch can be pretty much anywhere we landed a table for 10 easily. The place was semi-dead when we arrived as we came around 9:30 am. Merchant picked right up though and left me feeling very happy we landed the table we had.   What I have to appreciate about this place was the service. We had a waiter and he was very attentive and informative. Whether it be about food options or the drinks on the menu, he was solid. He was so solid at cash out he even told us about the automatic 20% gratuity added to our bill. That to me is solid as it gets.   The food well it was good. I enjoyed a salmon cake benedict and it was every bite of scrumptious. My wife had eggs, toast and sausage. A basic breakfast and really nothing to complain about. Our drinks were great. Really tasty coffee, a solid Bloody Mary and even some killer dark stout brews.   I'm not sure if Merchant would be my go to spot for brunch but it sure hit the spot that day. I would try them for an afternoon lunch or dinner any day though. That bar was solid and I enjoyed the beers in particular. There is a reason Merchant has four solid stars and it shows! Good job! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Merchant itself has a dark restaurant and a different layout, but the food was worth it. I went with a date on a Tuesday night and we split a \"cheap date night dinner\" for $40. This included two entrees, a bottle of wine, and a dessert. We absolutely loved it. We received salmon with quinoa on the side and the wine paired well with the meal. The dessert was a small cake bites with fruit. I think that this restaurant provided great service and I would go back again for the food. I have heard some rumors about really good cheesecurds so I hope to try them next time :)"}
{"text":"Mind-blowing cocktails, great food and a great vibe.  I had two cocktails, Invasion:two and a quarter, and Winter is coming. They were both phenomenal and I easily could have had ten more! I ate the mussels which were good, but they could have been fresher. But, we are in land-locked Madison after all!"}
{"text":"Merchant is perfect! Great drinks expertly mixed. Food is amazing as well! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Have I really never written a review of Merchant? I've been here at least 5 times, the most recent being a week ago, and Merchant never disappoints!   First and foremost, Merchant has great mixologists. Their cocktails are unique and delicious. Secondly, the head chef totally knows what he's doing with the farm-to-table concept. I've tried everything from bone marrow, bison tartare, cheese and meat plates, flat breads, salads, and fish. Everything is always delicious. Never a complaint from me!   Check out their Facebook page for daily specials. The other day, I found out the offer half price bottles of wine on Wednesdays, and they always post amazing pictures of their food."}
{"text":"I stopped here with my boyfriend for drinks around 9:30 on Friday night after having dinner at their sister restaurant Lucille. It wasn't too crowded and we sat and ordered at the bar. We both had a margarita for the first round and then went for a Moscow Mule and Bee's Knees the second round. We really like the atmosphere, decor, the menu and you can tell the bartenders care about the artistry that goes into making cocktails.   When it got closer to 10:30 they started clearing tables out of the dining area and people started to crowd around the bar to order drinks in anticipation of live music that started at \"10:37ish\". The ambiance of the place went from upscale and romantic to a little more laid back and casual at that point. I was surprised to see some people in sports jerseys and downing expensive cocktails but I guess the crowd is a little more rowdy later at night  so that's something to be aware of depending on what kind of night you are looking for."}
{"text":"The owner has since sent me a message apologizing for our horrid experience and offered us a gift certificate to give them another try. Of course, throughout were some interesting excuses as to why we had mediocre food and the slowest service. Why would we accept a GC from you? So we can get some more shitty service on the house? No thanks! Hey, I know: why don't you (please note: by 'you' I mean anyone this may apply to... you know who you are) stop hiring comically inept/apathetic servers and staff just because you think they look young, whatever. Seriously, Madison bar/restaurant owners: hire some real, professional staff. NOT your siblings, significant others, drug dealers, BFFs, fuckbuddies, whatever. That's nepotism. I won't spend money to be ignored by yet another bored 20-something rich kid or someone's shallow girlfriend while she texts her friends. There is a glut of experienced service staff out there who are far more deserving of employment than the stuck-up assholes you persist in hiring. And, I am not interested in trying any of your ostentatious and overpriced cocktails. I can make my own at home, and better.   My name is Joshua Berkson and I am the owner of Merchant.  I wanted to send you an urgent message expressing how deeply sorry I am for your experience this weekend.  We had a new server on the floor, and I am afraid that this contributed to your poor service.  I am stunned and ashamed at your review, and can only say that we are actively working to improve the service.  I will say that our bacon is top f the line, from a heritage local pig.  I agree too pricey.  We will make it less so.  Our coffee is Kickapoo Coffee, which I agree with you that our cups are too small!  We choose that cup so that the coffee doesn't get to warm while you are drinking it.  There is nothing marked up in the grocery over 25%...  Besides this, though, your satisfaction is my main goal.  I hope that you are able to try us again and revise your post.  We are young, and trying hard to improve.  Please send me your address so that I could possibly send you a gift card toward a future visit.  I hope that you are pleased the next visit.  You will see bigger cups, hotter coffee, better service, and a revised menu.  Best Regards'  Hey- perhaps you might want to train your servers before you put them out on the floor ALONE (as our server was that day). Or, even better: hire staff with experience? WTF? Is it rocket science? And, no, I am not revising my post. That was our experience and Yelp is for sharing it. Deal."}
{"text":"A little pricey for a cocktail, but so worth it! I have never had a bad cocktail here. So much time and attention goes into each one. Love the atmosphere. Love the location. Love the huge selection. Try the Whiskey Sour - they make them the old school way using egg whites. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been to Merchant four times now, and never have I gotten what I would even refer to as decent service.  Twice, that's right, twice, I have been sat by a hostess and never greeted or acknowledged by a server. One of the times after twenty minutes of being overlooked, we left and the other time spent two hours there eating one appetizer not due to our own pace but because of the sluggishness of our waitress. We had been intending to eat dinner but did not even get a chance to order it.  The most recent time I was there, just this past weekend, the amount that I signed for on the credit card receipt and what I was charged was off by twenty dollars.  They over charged my twenty dollars. I will never be returning.   EDIT- I did receive a voice mail from the owner that was very polite, as well as a message here.  I was glad that the billing issues were resolved and I was credited for the mistake as well as for the meal."}
{"text":"I've been hearing good things about Merchant's cocktails for a while, so decided to check it out for restaurant week.  The cocktail menu did not disappoint, each description I read sounded amazing.  The restaurant was so dark, though, that I had to hold my candle up to to the menu to read it, and even that was still difficult.  I love ambiance and candlelight as much as the next person - but I also like being able to read my menus and see my food.  The food was quite good.  I rarely order chicken in restaurants because it is so often overdone, but the chicken was moist, delicious and paired beautifully with the flavors of the sauce and side.  The farro pasta was the perfect winter dish and both of our appetizers (carpaccio and ricotta) were a great start to the meal.    Servers were friendly and attentive.  Overall a solid meal and I will definitely return, if only to work my way through that cocktail list."}
{"text":"I strongly advise a detour to Lazy Susan's if considering brunch at Merchant.  I walked in on the afternoon of the large art fair on the square.  It was warm and sunny outside, and the Merchant had blocked off a nice outdoor seating area.  I went up to the hostess stand where a server was standing, and I asked her if we could sit outside.  She said, \"Sure.  I'll be outside in a moment.\"  A moment turned into nearly 10 minutes.  Finally, the host appeared with a carafe of water and two glasses.  He said, \"A server will be right with you.\"  The server's appearance took nearly another 10 minutes, and we had not even seen a menu during this time.  So, when the server finally appeared, she brought us menus.  The brunch was basic with a few standout options.  My husband and I went the basic route, opting for an \"American\" style breakfast of scrambled eggs, Breakfast potatoes, sausage patties and Madison sourdough wheat toast.  I went with the Greek yogurt with granola, honey, and dried fruit.  It took about 20 minutes before our food arrived.  Thank goodness we brought the newspaper and a book I was reading.  It helped us to be a little less perturbed by the snailed waitstaff.  The interior dining room had not been that busy when we walked in, so we could not comprehend why it was taking so long in between staff appearances.  We noticed that was the case with other tables, and there were murmurs of disappointment from diners surrounding us.  When our food was delivered, the table became filled with plates.  The kitchen had presented the food on different dishes: the American fries in a bowl; the scrambled eggs on a plate with the sausage; the toast on a small butter plate.  Unnecessary and wasteful.  Plate everything but the toast, at least.  The plating was not the only issue.  Although the scrambled eggs had a good flavor, they were slightly burned.  The sausage were greasy and overcooked.  The only redeeming plate among them was the order of American fries.  Those had crispy skins and great seasoning.    My granola and yogurt were all in one bowl, but quite a sad presentation.  There was a heaping serving of Greek yogurt with a pathetic sprinkling of granola.  I expect the granola to play at least a supporting role in this menu item, seeing that it says \"maple almond;\" I would like the flavor from the maple to stand out more.  I also expect granola to have some substance, some structure.  The sprinkling looked more like flakes than bites of granola.  The honey was a great additive, since it brought a luscious sweetness to the bowl, something it desperately needed.  Pure Sweet Honey Farm is a Verona producer of the sticky stuff, so there was the one plus.  I could really taste its quality.  But, aside from that and the delicious nutty wheat bread from the artisan bake shop, and the seasoned breakfast potatoes, we were unimpressed with the Merchant.  They will need to retool their AL fresco service and how they are executing their brunch items.  I will not completely discount the Merchant, though.  I am sure it was not named one of Madison Magazine's \"Best Of\" for nothing.  I think that ranking alone warrants a return visit, but it will have to be for an evening meal with one of their craft cocktails...indoors."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner while visiting our daughter. She has been here before and said the drinks are what they are known for. Mmmmm-mmmm... after having their sidecar, I agree. It was so good. Daughter had another drink with gin and oj. it was very good too. Hubby was driving... so we will have to comeback when we stay overnight so he can try their Manhattan!  We had some potato appetizer. The spices were good and it had crispy parts that were the best!  I had a Merchant burger. I ordered it medium well and it was a bit dry. Hubby had a burger and said it was so-so. Daughter had a salad, and we both had a soup that our waitress said was fantastic. Daughter and I felt it was \"meh\".  I'd definitely go back for drinks and appetizers!"}
{"text":"Until recently, I had only been at Merchant for cocktails. That's enough of a reason to love this place, as they have so many delicious & creative cocktails (be careful though - they're strong!).  BUT, I finally at dinner at Merchant, and oh my goodness - what have I been missing?!?  Our group of 4 started with the Ploughman's platter & an order of cheese curds. The Ploughman's Platter was one of my favorite meat & cheese starters ever - lots of good meat & cheese (of course), but it's served with some excellent pickled treats as well.  For my meal, I ordered the Steak Frites. I'm not normally the type to order a steak for dinner, but it was such a good call in this case. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare & it just melted in my mouth. Excellent.  Others in our group had the Osso Buco & the Scallops entrees and we all basically licked our plates clean.   5 stars for Merchant!"}
{"text":"I brought an out-of-town friend here recently, and was reminded how good this place is.  I have been here several times, so it's about time I write a review.    I get the Bijou cocktail (Gin, Sweet Vermouth, Green Chartreuse, Orange Bitters and Orange Oil--Served Up.) nearly every time I come here.  I love herbaceous cocktails that are not sweet, and this fits the bill perfectly!  As for food, you can't go wrong with the fried cheese curds and house-made buttermilk ranch.  The Friday perch fish fry has been amazing as well.  I have also tried the sliders, burgers, ploughman's board, pappardelle, beef carpaccio, watercress/mango salad, and house-made sodas, and they have all been delicious. Their menu rotates, so there is always something tasty to choose from.  I would give this place five stars, but I docked one star for discontinuing weekday lunch.  I'm sure it was a wise business decision, but it was so nice to be able to meet up with a friend for a midday snack and/or cocktail."}
{"text":"Because we didn't have reservations the wait was quoted as an hour to hour and a half. Luckily there were 2 seats at the bar for the girls with the guys having just enough room to stand. They have an outstanding drink menu (I tried 3 - all good) and we had an order of fries at the bar.  Our table was ready in less than an hour and our waiter was very attentive. We enjoyed the cheese curds, the steak was great, the barley bowl and cheese board were OK. VERY DARK inside so be ready to use your phone light to read the menu."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Madison. They have a great happy hour and their drinks are pretty darn good. I think the bourbon selection there is on point as there is something for everyone. Does change into a bit of a dance place in the eve, but more than just a college bar. I enjoy it as it caters to the post-college crowds. Great spot for a first date as well as birthday dinner."}
{"text":"Good drinks but unfortunately had an inexcusable run-in with the staff. The website does not have a \"contact us\" location so I felt obligated to annotate my experience here.  I was waiting in line for the restroom with many other patrons when one of the staff members (named Nick if I remember correctly) told me to \"stop being such a white privileged b**ch\" and got uncomfortably close to me while screaming in my face about a comment I made regarding the men's line taking less time than the females. I found this outburst both unprofessional and inexcusable.   I hope to personally here from Merchant as I do appreciate there business model and hop that one employee does not ruin it for everyone as it has ruined it for me."}
{"text":"A truly unique and very special experience, bartenders Tom Dufer anf Paul Davis are not merely knowledgeable and talented, but it is their creativity thst mskes this bar stand out in a town full of bars.  The original cocktails in the menu change each season, so be sure to stop back often! This reviewer will!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food and drinks! Had the Old fashioned and Side Car, yummy. Kristin was fabulous, thank you! Busy during restaurant week but handeled very professionally."}
{"text":"This place has a fun atmosphere and great service. When in Wisconsin I do like to see how a place's cheese curds stack up and I was not disappointed with merchant. I highly recommend getting one of the boards, but be warned there is more food than you think. The burger I got was tasty, but a bit greasiest than I like. The awesome service and delicious local cheeses took center stage here."}
{"text":"Wife and I went for dinner on a Friday night, place was very busy. It's got a cool foodie vibe and the drink menu is reason enough to visit. This is not a place to bring kids but if you're in the mood for a city feel dining experience and want to try a menu that no where else in Madison has then this is the place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite burgers downtown, and good cheese curds (although not in my top 5).  The craft cocktails are not to be missed! A very good selection of liquors, and the bartenders are amazing at their craft. The cocktail menu is rotating based on seasonal ingredients, but you should be able to find something to your taste on the menu."}
{"text":"Merchant does the craft cocktail scene well. I have yet to eat here, but have come for drinks on many occasions.  I was primarily a beer drinker until I discovered some amazing craft cocktail places like Merchant in the area. The drink menu itself is extensive, and they have drinks easily separated out by liquor. If you're a connoisseur or just a fan of a certain type of liquor, you can easily find some options without having to read through all of the drinks. The bartenders are also helpful if you have questions, they know how to shake a cocktail and are quick to ask if you want another.  You can easily spend a lot of money here on just drinks alone, but this is where you should order those craft cocktails. It's a great place for before or after dinner drinks. Bar seating can be limited when they are busy, but it's really just a toss up on the night. If you check in on Yelp here you do get a $1 off a craft cocktail. Not a huge discount, but better than nothing.  The food looks good, and they have a brunch menu that they only offer during the summer. Also, they do have patio seating which would be great on a summer night."}
{"text":"This place has a nice atmosphere and good wait staff, but unfortunately the food was mediocre. I had the Merchant Burger, and ordered it medium rare. The burger I received was at least well done, and relatively flavorless. I expected a little bit more for a 12 dollar burger."}
{"text":"I recently went to Merchant for the second time.  The first time was for dinner during restaurant week a few years ago, and I just now had the opportunity to come back for brunch.  Finally.    Their ingredients are locally sourced, and if you're really interested, you can flip over the menu and see a map of where it all comes from.  While I know they're also known of their drinks, I'm much more a fan of their food.  The drinks are far too complicated, the menu far too long, and I find it overwhelming.   The food though. Delicious.  On this trip I had a breakfast burrito.  A tequila braised pork burrito with scrambled eggs, black beans, corn pico de gallo, white cheddar, topped with cheddar queso, served with salsa, sour cream & field greens. I wish I lived closer than three hours away so I could eat this every day.    To drink, I had a mimosa, which was an average mimosa. I also had the \"El Burbujas\" cockatail.  Altos Blanco tequila, peach syrup, grapefruit and lime juices, seltzer and Jamaican bitters. And it tasted nothing like what I expected. It pretty much tasted like tequila, seltzer and bitters. Odd. Like I said, food is better than the booze. They do have a decent craft beer list though, which is always a good fall back."}
{"text":"Looking for the fanciest most mixologist made drink in Madison? Then the Merchant is your spot.  It is really fun to watch them concoct these drinks with all the crazy ingredients (fruits, herbs, tinctures) floating about.  The menu, however, is an eye-sore.  It is pert near impossible to read and way to hipster in its description.  I really wish they would change it. For dinner we were in a large party and between the group had just about everything.  The cheese board it what stands out in my mind.  I don't want to complain about the food to much because we were a large group but the medium-rare burger came out well done and my buddy said his steak wasn't cooked right either. I have been here for some wonderful music and I will be again some day."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Merchant twice and had drinks there a couple times beyond that. Both meals were really good - lamb burgers for dinner and some kind of breakfast sandwich for lunch. My favorite cocktail I've had in Madison or possibly ever was their Supercalifragalisticexpi-ala-Altos (I had to copy and paste that from their online menu), a refreshing, not-too-sweet tequila cucumber blend. I don't even like cocktails and I have ordered this more than once. Personally, I think their late night vibe is a little weird. By day, this place is classy-casual with really great food and drinks. I recently took a friend here for her first visit because she wanted a cocktail, and we went around 10pm. It was pitch black, we couldn't hear anything over the strange instrumental house music, and my friend asked if we could leave."}
{"text":"A great place to enjoy the food, cocktail, and the atmosphere. The meat cuisines are so tender and flavorful. Plenty options of cocktails and they all taste pretty good. Desserts really good as well."}
{"text":"I like this place. Hamburgers and mussels and fancy drinks. Lively atmosphere and great service. I've come for brunch, lunch and dinner and always had a great experience. We once came with a child and they were very accommodating - for that, I will always like them."}
{"text":"The food is decent. That's all I can say. It will not blow your taste buds away in a revolutionary sense. But it will get the job done.   Appetizers are better than main dishes for sure. The cheese and charcuterie plate shined through but our main entrees were unimpressive."}
{"text":"Had a nice lunch here yesterday. Big first perk: we had a party of 7 and had a terrible time finding any place with less than a 40 minute wait (likely a side effect of a football Saturday) but we stumbled upon merchant and they seated us right away!  Cool, seemingly well-crafted menu with tons of local foods! I had the fried chicken sandwich and it was delicious.   Massive whiskey selection, and funny little spins on traditional brunch cocktails (they do tequila in the Bloody Mary, which also comes with a tiny bottle of high life).   The waitress was nice. A little goofy, but attentive and nice."}
{"text":"Visited the Capital and stopped in for a light lunch.  I had the Steamed Mussels and they were great.  Many of the tables had children at them, so it should be a very kid friendly stop."}
{"text":"Does not allow hats.  Even for the Milwaukee brewers.   Verrrrry pretentious.   Ooohh, look at me in my vest and bow tie.   Would you like a $10 drink that takes 8 minutes to make??"}
{"text":"So, at my friend's insistence, I gave this place another shot. As dinner began, I couldn't figure out what I'd hated so much about this place previously. The waitress was beyond friendly, the meal was among the best I'd had in Madison, the decor was a bit over the top but certainly not offensive... then, in the middle of dinner, the lights turned off, colorful strobing began, and the music became so loud as to entirely preclude conversation. It was as if 3/4 of the way through dinner my restaurant had a midlife crisis and brought a corvette with the vanity plate BigBoy69.   Anyway, I've adjusted my review to reflect the quality of the food, but my previous comments on the atmosphere still apply."}
{"text":"By far the best Cocktails in Madison. Love the low light setting, romantic. Amazing atmosphere for a date night. The cheese curds here are super good and light. Our service rocked too! That is always a plus to go with the great food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good cocktail menu with a mix of seasonal classics and some new concoctions made up by the staff. Has a nice casual feel for such high-quality stuff. Interior is well designed in the popular old-timey hipster industrial style.  Staff seemed knowledgeable, though I think I out-drink-nerded our bartender at one point - she did not seem to know what a Martinez was when I referenced it - which says more about me than it does her probably. Recommended."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a chilly Saturday morning. Delicious cheese curds, very generous portions, great service... what more could you ask for? The fried chicken sandwich I ordered was massive! I had to eat some of the chicken separately. Well fried and flavored nicely. Can't wait to come back here!"}
{"text":"Our server at Merchant was excellent.  She made very good recommendations for the cocktails.  We had fried cheese curds for the appetizer.  I have not had fried cheese curds before, so I have nothing to compare it to, but these were pretty good if you like that kind of thing.  I ordered the burger and requested that it be cooked rare.  When it came, however, it was cooked well done....real disappointed.  We told the server and she was extremely gracious about the error and took it back right away.  I was given a house salad (really tasty) while I waited.  I can't complain about the accommodations that were made for the error on my order, it is just an awkward situation when you get your meal after everyone at your table is already done eating!  Everyone else I was with really enjoyed their food and got what they wanted!  I would try Merchant again, this particular trip just didn't blow me away.   The atmosphere is cool and my burger was excellent the second time around!"}
{"text":"Decent food, solid drinks. Absurdly loud if u get there on a Friday or Saturday after 10."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but it's just ok. I've been there several times. Drinks and food both look great on the menu, but the actual result is pedestrian."}
{"text":"This place really gets me, but they miss the mark on so many basic things too.  Let's start with the good: really really delicious food and creative, fun drinks. Their menu also has a vegetarian option and their lunch includes deli sandwiches. They also have a brunch which I haven't made it to because it's only Farmers Market Saturdays. I tried looking up the brunch hours on their website, but it was quite confusing since different pages had different days/hours on them. I've had dinner here twice and lunch once, trying the Tagliatelle pasta for dinner and a portabello mushroom deli sandwich for lunch. Both were quite good.  According to their website, they are no longer open for lunch (they open at 3pm for happy hour).  Most recently, I've frequented Merchant for their weekend nights, when they always have a DJ. Sometimes the place is packed and it takes 20+ minutes to get a drink (drinks take a little longer to make when you shake and stir EVERYTHING...). Other times the DJ is soso and Merchant's true \"attitude\" comes out.  Recently, I was there on a night DJ Nick Nice was playing. He played some pretty awful music and refused any requests. I thought he might mix it up since nobody was dancing, but no luck there. I'm deducting one star for the DJs alone: it's not hard to find a DJ that plays a variety of music that everyone likes.  Their prices on food and drinks also seem to be a few dollars high than all the other comparable bars/restaurants in Madison. I guess you're paying for the fancy wallpaper?  Try it if you're new to town, but go early in the evening and get their Moscow Mule. One of the best in Madison!"}
{"text":"We hosted a bachelorette party dinner here at merchant, and had an Amazing time being wined & dined!!! Thank you to Maddy, & her team for her special treatment to the bride, and all of her partners in crime :) it was a great, delicious feast to start the evening off right :)"}
{"text":"I came at night for drinks and dancing, so I cannot speak to the quality of the food, only drinks. But what I can day is that the drinks were delicious (a little on the pricey side but worth it). My friends and I came wanting to have a drink and dance the night away and boy did we ever! Will be back for sure, but next time I hope to enjoy a bite to eat."}
{"text":"I love it here. While it can be quite crowded and loud, the food makes up for it. Extensive drink menu and great service."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for restaurant week and sat on the patio. The inside was busy and the entire patio at least was full. It was a very compact space, and our server served us from outside the patio rail. Our server was very energetic and conveyed her love for Merchant and Merchant's drinks without trying very hard at all.   She was super knowledgeable about the drinks' ingredients and was great at making recommendations - you tell her what you like and she'll tell you what original cocktail Merchant serves that is better than your go to drink. I told her I like Moscow Mule's and she recommend the Peking Man ($10). This drink is made of ginger infused Rittenhouse Rye Whiskey and contains homemade mint syrup, honey and lemon juice. It was very light and refreshing and a perfect summer drink.   Off the restaurant week menu I began with the Summer Squash Soup as a starter. This soup contained small pieces of shrimp and was flavored with garlic and cilantro and drizzled with chili oil, which was orange in color and swirled in the soup like balsamic vinegar does in oil.   For my main I got the pork loin. The flavor was good, but I was disappointed that these thin pieces of pork were ringed in fat which had to be trimmed off. The accouterments were spot on however and I enjoyed the potatoes and the mix of beans, kale and stewed tomatoes that I was served.   Dessert portions were very reasonable and could be eaten 100% without feeling gluttonous. I got the Huckleberry Panna Cotta."}
{"text":"The Merchant is a good, classy place to go for drinks or food. However, the lighting is always too dim and service leaves something to be desired. Every time I go, whether with a group or just one friend, I end up waiting far too long to be helped, regardless or how crowded it is. The drinks are really amazing and creative though, and may are worth how pricy they are! The food has always been pretty good, but I wouldn't put it among my favorites in the Capitol area. Also, when they have live DJs it is a bit awkward because the space isn't really set up for that so I prefer to go there when it is just set up with tables for classier drinks with friends."}
{"text":"Not the place to go for New Years Eve.  The food, while good, was pretty sparse.  Two of us had the lobster; incredible small portion along with the shrimp side dish; more like a baby portion.  For $75 a person and leaving there $500 less in our pocket, we went for pizza 2 1/2 hours later.  The only decision we regret all weekend."}
{"text":"Great drink spot, craft cocktails with fresh twist. Good was OK-I had the ribs and those were great, well cooked and flavorful but the sides were meh.   Deffiently get the buffalo cheese curds!"}
{"text":"Merchant is one of my favorite Madison restaurants! Get the mussels. They're amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was not bad, but something seems off here...The malbec tasted rancid and how hard is it to choose a good malbec?  The dessert (flourless choc cake) was also very tart, not that great. Steak frites was just ok."}
{"text":"Our visit started a bit rocky but once the road was righted I could see that this is an impressive restaurant and bar (and liquor store).  There we two groups at the hostess stand when we walked in and we took our place in line.  There seemed to be a bit of chaos with the staff behind the podium and when we reached the front of the line we were told the hostess called in and servers were trying to cover her duties.  We were shown to our table and the experience was nothing but stellar from that point forward.   A super cheery, but not fake, waitress came to take our order.   I promptly choose the Saturday morning brunch requisite; a Bloody Mary.   The Merchant take is excellent.  For starters one can take the traditional route and have their drink with vodka.  Or you can substitute gin and have a Bloody Margaret.  Or a Bloody Maria (tequila instead of vodka) is also an option.  Judging by the glasses of fresh herbs on the bar rail and the extensive selection of spirits behind the bar I knew their bloody mix would be homemade, and most likely tasty, before the drink even arrived.   The good news is the drink completely lived up to my advanced hype.  The mix had layers of spices, Worcestershire being the deepest, then some hints of horseradish and a bright finish of celery salt on the end.   Garnish was simple, but as long as the mix is good it's a good drink for me.  The special of the day was a market omelet filled with fresh vegetables.  Since we had just come from the Farmer's Market  this sounded like the perfect choice.  Fresh shiitake mushrooms, asparagus, sunchokes, and spinach.  All were well seasoned and sauteed in olive oil before being stuffed inside the light and fluffy omelet.   A side of rosemary and parmesan potatoes rounded out the dish nicely.  Our service was wonderful - not too attentive but not neglectful either and she really did a good job on creating a fun and positive atmosphere.  And back to the aforementioned liquor store.  It's not exactly a store per se (see my photo) but there is an entire wall full of spirits and wines for retail purchase.  There's many places in Madison I'd like to try for the first time, but I have a feeling I may be back at the Merchant for again before I get through that list."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Merchant. We've only ever been here for appetizers and drinks. They have an extensive drink menu and have never been disappointed. Their bartenders are super fast and friendly and easy on the eyes which is a plus. They have a really good cheese and meat board and their warm olives with ricotta is tasty as well.  It is usually busy here but the bar is large and we can usually snag a seat. If you don't get a seat it can be hard to find standing  space as their dining area is smaller and goes right up to the bar.  There clientele can be a bit uppity and pretentious. My husband would probably give this place a 2 stars because of that aspect plus the crowdedness. One time there was women saving a seat for someone which is fine. She said my husband could sit there until her friend got there. We were thinking maybe 5 minutes which was fair enough to ask too and he didn't mind moving. But then a half hour later she asked my husband to move, we were done with our drinks and moving on anyways, but really? That's not the the bars fault but its just the kind of people you might find there. Its fun to come here on a girl's night before dinner and a show otherwise I drag my husband against his will."}
{"text":"Just walked out around 11:30pm. Seemed like an alright place, except we never got service. We confirmed with the bartender, twice, if the kitchen was still open (it was, according to him and their board outside until 1am). Sat at one of their tables by the bar, saw one server, not sure if she also had to take care of their patio, but it was obvious she was overwhelmed. Just from working in the industry, it would've been nice if she had at least just acknowledged us one of the few times she walked past us trying to avoid eye contact... We would've stayed if there was any sign that we would've gotten served even within 15 min. I get it, you get busy- and maybe management screwed their staff over with understaffing, but just basic service step- put drink/food menus down, or at least let your table know you'll be with them in a few minutes. It didn't seem like anyone cared, not the bartender, not the server, management was nowhere to be seen... Sorry, I normally don't write bad reviews because I hate that yelp culture, but this experience felt more rude than basic poor service."}
{"text":"My last stop on a weekend getaway, there were quite a few options to choose from on the 60-some-odd page cocktail and spirits menu. Clean, open space, with a friendly bartender. $2 off during Happy Hour (3-6 pm) or $1 off cocktails with Yelp check-in. I had The Regret, with vodka, lime juice, and rosemary - very refreshing. My fiance had the \"Remember the Maine\" twist on an Old Fashioned while we watched baseball on the TV and jammed along to Bohemian Rhapsody with the other bar patrons. Didn't give the 5th star only because I didn't try any food, but drinks were great!"}
{"text":"Another higher upscale bar in Madison, but I can't deny the quality of the drinks.  I was so stoked that they had Pisco Sours there, the national drink of Peru.  They are simply great, as well as their Moscow Mules. It's always crowded in Merchant, and pretty expensive.  However, I think their bar staff is great and have always had a good experience with them."}
{"text":"Trendy, hipster restaurant at a great location. Their desserts are my favourite. Turns into a night club over the weekends after 9, but remains a moderately chill restaurant during the day. Highly recommended if you're looking to get brunch and feel like you're in a bigger city in Madison."}
{"text":"Merchant seems like it was made by a moody hipster who couldn't decide if it liked romantic dining or English pubs more. With the dusk-like lighting, darkly rustic wood, simple and elegant dining menu, and extensive display and menu of drinks, I think both inspirations met quite nicely. The bar staff was friendly and creative, while the waiting service left me slightly miffed at times. I had scotch and a cocktail from the bar, and then cheese curds, brussel sprouts and the lamb shanks for dinner (a new addition to the menu). The drinks were perfect, and I enjoyed the brussel sprouts. The cheese curds were fine, and the lamb shanks were cooked perfectly, but seemed very under seasoned. When it comes to quality vs. price, I'd give it a B. Would I go back? Absolutely! Is the best place in Madison for a romantic dinner and cocktail experience? I don't think so."}
{"text":"Doesn't matter if your looking for great food or just a great not out. The merchant has it all at a great price. They always make sure your belly is full and your glass is full."}
{"text":"I've been giving out a lot of 4-Stars lately, but then again I'm trying to only spend my money at places I think are worth it.  Merchant Madison is definitely one of those places... but you have to go with the right attitude. This place attracts all sorts of characters from grungy hipsters to prickish tycoons.  Whenever I go, I am sure to talk to the waiter about their opinions and have a conversation about my dislikes and likes both concerning food and beverages.  I think, if you go with an open-mind, not one seeking chicken fingers and a long island ice tea, this place will not disappoint you!  Beyond that, I highly recommend the Classic Burger and the Smoking Barrels cocktail."}
{"text":"BEST. BRUNCH. EVER!!!  We stopped after a recent farmers market and sat on the patio...we only thought of Merchant as a night spot...boy were we wrong!  My husband had a tequila bloody mary and I had their house mimosa, both were some of the best we've had in town!  Service was phenomenal as well.  The food is outstanding.  My husband had the fried chicken sandwich (I snagged a bite and was jealous!).  I had the sausage biscuit sandwich which was equally amazing and served on a fresh buttermilk biscuit!  The breakfast potatoes are out of this world too...yes it's just a potato but I crave these things every Saturday morning!  So glad we stumbled onto brunch here, now we drag friends and family back whenever we can!"}
{"text":"We ate there recently and sat outdoors. The burger was great with the mint julip. Good service and good value. Will eat there again!."}
{"text":"I am such fan of this place!   I've only been there two times so far but both times the food have been excellent!  I ordered the steak and the mussels, the mussels are to die for! (personally think its better then sardines and eno vino!) the sauce is literally to die for~!  The second time I went, we had the garlic bread app (amazing!) and the sausage pasta there is really good :)  The ambience there is great for a date and there cocktails are made with brandy!!  Note: i went during dinnertimes and at winter so it might be different since they change their menus frequently!"}
{"text":"I came here for the cocktails and was not disappointed. I wish Merchant was located in New York!   Whiskey sours are my drink of choice and Merchant makes one of the best. Really, I think this ranks at the very top. The Blood and Sand also won me over. You can tell each cocktail was made with care for ingredients. The history of the different spirits and drinks are included in a fancy cloth bound menu. They're even careful about choosing the right glass--you won't get a martini in an old fashioned glass here. People have mentioned the price, but honestly I am so used to paying more for mediocre cocktails in NYC that Merchant's prices felt like a bargain.   The place is also just a joy to be in: liquor bottles shelved high on one side, a classy bar with large windows looking out to the lake on the other, and intimately arranged tables and deep, rich wood all throughout.  It doesn't feel pretentious, but it's also no dive bar. I think this would have been a good place to bring a friend or a date. There's also room for groups.  After two drinks I was feeling pretty buzzed so I got a burger. It was alright, maybe a tad overcooked for medium rare. Not amazing, but good. The cheese boards looked yummy. I came here for the drinks anyways, so I'm giving the place five stars.  Also, there's some great staff here. I always got just the right amount of attention even though I was on my own.  Madison, you are spoiled!"}
{"text":"First we went to the bar area and couldn't find a seat, so we went ahead and had the hostess seat us because the whole place is pretty small and they were pretty busy.  We had the Tuesday special \"Cheap Date Night\" where you get two preselected entrees, one preselected bottle of wine and one preselected dessert to share for $40.  Atmosphere was cozy and trendy...industrial mixed with rustic..dim lighting...very nice.  The service was great, no complaints.  The food was ok.  No real complaints.  It was white fish with the skin on, some cubed potatoes, lettuce greens and and some type of vegetable straws.  All with a nice sweet but light sauce on it.  The dessert was a deconstructed s'more.  Only a light bit of chocolate was on it, mostly just a large toasted marshmallow and small graham cracker...not too impressive.  The entree wasn't enough to keep you full all night but was at least filling for an hour.  We had the cheese curds.  They were typical fried cheese pieces and were ok.  The cheese stayed soft in the middle so that was good.  Overall, it was a good place to visit and I would go back but would not eat the same thing."}
{"text":"As a Californian who jumps at the chance to try cheese curds every time I am in the midwest, I have to say these were the best cheese curds I have ever had. Perfectly lightly battered and crispy but not overdone. Melt in your mouth goodness with the perfect amount of chewy.   The restaurant was crowded, so our party of 3 sat at the bar, but we were still promptly served and enjoyed the ambiance very much! What a pleasant and beautiful bar with big windows."}
{"text":"Was in here this weekend in need of some brunch and mimosa. I had friends from out of town with me. They had originally requested DLUX for the bottomless mimosas, but when we asked for a table they said it was a TWO HOUR WAIT. Nope.    We walked down to Merchant and were seated immediately! I am SO GLAD we came here instead. I hadn't been to Merchant for brunch yet, but I have a feeling I will be back sooner than later!   Our server was great! He was friendly and personable.   I ordered the Eggs Benny for my meal. It was delicious. The Hollandaise sauce was honestly some of the best Hollandaise I think I have ever had. Really great flavor and it was the perfect texture. Creamy and light in color. So good. The ham was really good as well. The meal came with mixed greens which provided a nice light and fresh flavor that paired well with the richness of the Eggs Benny.   Others at the table tried the breakfast burrito and the 2 eggs breakfast. Everyone in the group seemed to really enjoy their meals. 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"I went here on a date and it's not really a date place, but the menu and food was good. It appeared to me more of a drinking place and/or a lunch place. I'd go back for lunch but probably not again for dinner."}
{"text":"I originally wrote my review raving about the food, atmosphere, and drinks. All my claims still stand if you're looking for a busier bar with tons and tons of cocktail options.  My realization is there are tons of better cocktails to be made in Madison. Whether it be Gibs or Heritage.. Those two are just much more intimate and \"cool\" in my opinion.   I don't dislike Merchant and will be back, but wish they had maybe a \"seasonal drink reccommendations \" list or something."}
{"text":"Fantastic craft cocktails, excellently choreographed kitchen and service, and farm fresh ingredients treated lightly with respect for their natural and essential flavors. And a fun, vibrant atmosphere without pretense. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Great energy, cocktails and food. Comfortable yet interesting. Something familiar and something new."}
