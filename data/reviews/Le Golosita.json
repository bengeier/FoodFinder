{"text":"hit Le G last week with sis and her daughters.  kinda depressing to hit this shopping center and see white chocolate grill close, i believe steele's is closed, a few other places closed , too.  First time i sit in the dining room.  Sis orders a pizza, youngest niece orders ravioli, older niece orders a mystery pasta dish ( even with the dining area less than 1/4 full, the acoustics suck - very hard to hear everyone at the table ) I try one of their specials - a kitchen sink deal - chicken with tomatoes, artichoke hearts, olives, i think asparagus with a cream sauce and a pasta side.  nothing much here - somewhat dull.    we also order 3   gelatos to share - we all agree this will save the meal.  the youngest ordered vanilla - she didn't like it, my sis tries it - something funny tasting about it - i give it a try - it's citrus-y  - lemon ?   sis tries again, yes, lemon.  advise the server.  he leaves, comes back and tells us that they occasionally get some rind into some of the flavors - huh ?  he then leaves !   oh well, one less place to go to !"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is 5 stars  While going next door for lunch I noticed the place was finally open...  The dessert section & fresh deli really is eye catching...everything is made so fresh... and looks soo appetizing  Since I already had lunch plans I decided to just get a dessert.. it was really hard to choose from, they had so many that looked sooo delicious!!!!  What I selected looked a little better than it tasted but that will not stop me from returning... I,  in fact made  Valentines Day reservations... I will let you know how that goes  UPDATE::: 2/14/08 , food is AWSOME, presentation is totally 5 stars,   I actually found a cool site that offers half off discounts...  pizza is great so is the sea food.. will go again & again!!!!"}
{"text":"I swear I wrote the review to this place already but just couldn't find it. So here I go again. I went here when they first opened for a meeting and I couldn't be more disappointed. The staff was horrible, everyone was like chickens with their heads cut off, except they were all standing around doing nothing and not paying attention to anyone.   I ordered sparkling water with lime. They brought lemon, I asked again, they brought more lemon, I asked again and then I got line after 30 minutes of being there and our food already being served.   The decor is horrible, the food wasn't worth the the ingredients, if I could I would have gone back and made the dishes myself. It was overpriced, under service. I could go on, but the atmosphere was just bad, the owners were there and payed no attention to their guests except for the owners friend.  Just because you open a restaurant doesn't mean you can make money and this place even got me to want to do a chargeback except i paid cash because we couldnt get the check, or change, or anything."}
{"text":"Nina and I drove to Vegas to attend our friend's bridal shower. Of course, Nina went off to enjoy the festivities while I stayed and hung out with the groom to be and watched football. We visited this place on a Saturday while it was still scorching outside, so we were in the mood for some creamy and super cold gelato.  We left the restaurant a little disappointed. Spend your money elsewhere....probably the only reason I would go back to this restaurant would be to get a couple of slices of prosciutto....They seem to have a good supply of that in their deli, however, I would expect it to be expensive. 6 dollar small cups of gelato. Yeash."}
{"text":"This place is gorgeous.  They didn't skimp on a single thing as far as the decor goes, and it's definitely a place to take a date.  Food-wise, the prices are much more reasonable than the other reviews seem to make it out to be.  The most expensive things are around $16-25, but most are around the $12 range, and the sandwiches are about $8.  I could tell that everything was made in-house, but the sandwich I had was a little unimpressive, as it was mostly bread and not too much of the filling.    What makes this place is the desserts.  The gelato here is easily the best anywhere in Vegas, but this comes at a steep $8 price, which is out of my range for anything except the most special occasions.  The other baked items were exquisite.  I'm also a tea fanatic, and I have to say that the chai latte that they have here is better than anywhere in Vegas ever, and I've tried easily 20 different styles.    Service was okay, not incredible or very attentive, but all my needs were provided.  The host wore a sour expression, but did his job. The server was prompt and polite, if not overly friendly.  The ambiance was very nice, with soft music playing.  The bathrooms and embellishments there-in are a wonderful touch, and I absolutely loved the fact that there was a mouth-wash dispenser with little cups there.  Perfect touch, well-done.    Overall, I recommend this place, but moreso for a coffee and dessert than the food itself, though it is certainly not bad."}
{"text":"I wonder if we are all rating the same restaurant - not very often do you see such a huge difference in  reviews.  Anyhow....I'm really hungover after killing two bottles of vodka with a bunch of drag queens last night, so I'm going to get this review done quickly.    Pros:  Outdoor seating The fried calamari Oddly, they deliver  Cons:  Forgetful staff (as in entire portions of our meal!) The same sides for every entree (gross string beans and potatoes or something) Noise level Cafeteria like atmosphere The gelato sucked a fat one  Bathroom upstairs (like someone else said, you get to be the star of the tinkle show everytime you need to pee cuz of the stairs being in the middle of the damned room) High prices for low quality food    I think that about covers it.  And in case you were wondering, no, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Wow -- finally...really good Italian -- in the neighborhood -- with real Italians in the kitchen...on the floor...molto bene...mi piace...heavy sigh!  So here's the deal -- these are the folks who run Zefferino's in the Venetian -- they've opened this place -- been open 2 months as your eagle-eyed yelpers have told you -- and they were dead on -- finding this is totally a credit to yelp!  yay!    Maria Theresa and her husband, Francesco are so lovely, so genuine -- there's also Aldo -- and on the floor, Pierre -- the token Frenchman... we can't wait to \"hug in\" again!  We had eggplant parm, branzino and the lobster tagliatelle -- and started with the calamari/zucchini fritte...but the real telltale sign that we were in for a treat -- the breads...yep - their breads are spot-on flawless...olive bread, focaccia, grissini and wafer thin flat bread so crispy and fresh you can barely pick it up without it crumbling...  Prices -- totally reasonable -- most entrees are all under $20 -- love that...in fact, most of the pastas were under $15 and finally -- portions that aren't just stupid huge...   We decided long before we sampled our way through the gelato, the cookies and pastries, that this was our new favorite restaurant!  Note:  they have an upstairs private room -- perfect for 20 -  24 -- it's a little cramped, but there are restrooms upstairs...local companies take note -- this is perfect for a lunch meeting -- or for us, Girls' Night Out -- after our last rowdy happening at Table 34, we've decided perhaps a buffer between us and the rest of the world is a good thing...  Go -- eat!    Oh and if you're wondering like I was, where the devil this place is located (let's face it, Eastern isn't good enough of a directional for me these days...-- turn in that new shopping center that is home to the monstrosity called White Chocolate Grill (yeah, right...)  -- drive right past and park behind it -- that's Le Golosita!  At first glance, you'll probably think it's Mexican like we did... I'm sure you'll enjoy your dinner much more than if you'd chosen WCG...    One more tip:  meringue gelato...huge wow...  update:  took the kids last night -- and had pizzas... divine -- we had a margherita -- then the kids decided they also wanted a meatball and sausage pizza even though it wasn't on the menu and the kitchen happily obliged and it was delicious (so good the boys ate 2 12\").   I'm now going to have to try their spaghetti & meatballs..."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the same ownership as Zefferino's at the Venetian though the menu is not nearly as ambitious and the pricing more friendly though hardly inexpensive.  We shared the Le Golosita salad - watercress, radicchio, arugula, cherry tomatoes, olives and shrimp wrapped in prosciutto in vinaigrette.  My wife's entre was veal saltimbocca - veal scaloppini topped with sage and pancetta in a white wine sauce. I chose the branzino - 2 Mediterranean sea bass filets with white wine and capers.  Each entre included roasted potatoes and crisp green beans. Prior to exiting we stopped at the adjoining bakery and taste tested several varieties of gelato.  It was a tough decision since 19 flavors were available, but we settled on a small cup of pistachio. All gelato is prepared in-house and each one we sampled was at least very good."}
{"text":"Update 5/13/08  In response to Carly's delightful little remark (WTF?) ...they \"import\" a lot of their chefs and staff from Italy where their cuisine originates.   Gelato certainly isn't something that everyone knows how to do.  It isn't like washing dishes.  I have had a lot of bad gelato in this city.  This place has great gelato.    This is a charming Italian restaurant with daily specials and fresh pasta.  Everything is made in house.  They brought over a man from Italy who makes fresh gelato.   A wide assortment of baked goods including traditional Italian cookies and pastries are made here as well.  Half of the shop is bakery, gelato, and prepared foods counters.  The first time I went there they had a whole boars head in the case.  It still had the eyes, teeth and hair on it.  This almost warranted an extra star for the sheer wow factor.  The down side is I am not a huge fan of the texture of the pasta here.  I think it is too coarse but not like improperly cooked pasta.  My guess is that they are using a strange blend of flour.  Maybe it is cut with garbanzo bean flour or something obscure like that.  I prefer the meat and fish dishes instead.  Terrific servers.  On the ball.  Prosciutto e melone is on the menu but they don't serve the melon in balls; they just give you disproportionate chunks."}
