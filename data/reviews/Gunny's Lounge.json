{"text":"The absolute best wings you will ever have.... Period! Do yourself a favor and get the special sauce."}
{"text":"This is a bar, but their wings are probably the best around. Complete with their special Gunny's sauce as well.  As far as bar food goes, this is the spot. Hoagies are slamming. Wings are off the chain. Their chicken tenders are awesome as well. Lots of cool appetizers. Had a ton of food from here. You'd be a fool to miss out."}
{"text":"When it's Tuesday night I always try to get to this place for their wings. Best fried chicken In the A-K valley, and maybe even the Pittsburgh area. Give this a try!"}
{"text":"Best wings!!!! Nice staff usually no issues here. Also they have other food that is really good the steak primantis knock off but better!"}
{"text":"Best wings around the Pittsburgh area. Go on wing night when they serve full wings for 90 cents. Very affordable place to eat. 

Also, they have great fries. Hard-working, blue collar restaurant where the people are friendly."}
{"text":"Great wings. Although I've had better, they have some of the best wings that I've had in New Kensington. I've picked up wings from this establishment a couple of times. It is a small bar like setting, always populated, and always playing upbeat music.

 I would only come here for the wings. The wings are approx $2 a wing but worth it. 

Don't forget the $.75 special sauce. You have to get it with the chicken in order to get the full experience."}
{"text":"The wings have always been great. But after paying a dozen for $23 I'll be going elsewhere from now on. Sad. Just too much to pay."}
{"text":"I went here once and there was legitimately one guy on one end of the bar and a guy on the other holding guns at each other. You best believe I would never let anyone i know go there! Did not try the food no comment on that."}
{"text":"Go here for the gigantic most delicious wings ever made. Great atmosphere, typical small town bar. But the wings, just OMG!!! Crispy, crunchy, heavenly. No breading, but the seasoning is out of this world. Must go!"}
{"text":"We usually treat ourselves to the wings here a couple times a year. It's a neighborhood dive bar with great wings. The price is a little high for a dozen but, once you eat them... worth every cent. The wings are the full wing and they get the biggest ones in the area. They remodeled the dinning area a couple years ago and it was a much needed improvement. The service is friendly ....give it a shot, it won't disappoint!"}
