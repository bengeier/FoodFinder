{"text":"Been here a few times now and I can say it's a solid place to get your shawarma fix. Lots of fresh toppings and I think they even have a hot sauce they make in house. Had it once and was pleased. A couple of times the pita was a but dry but no biggie"}
{"text":"Beautiful clean place with fresh and delicious donairs! We really love discovering donairs around town and we are happy to have such a great place close to home!"}
{"text":"Awesome donair. I have only had a few better in my life. The best part about this place is the toppings. The coleslaw they have is amazing and the garlic sauce..... Don't get me started. Awesome. Highly recommend. Stay away from the large unless you are super hungry. Medium is a good chunk of food."}
{"text":"At first i was weary of proceeding to try this place . It looked confusing . I walked in looked at the menu and i was confused on how to order these food items and iffy in general about the whole thing so i started to leave . The empolyees had knotice this and called me over to try some of the chicken . . . Well i tried it and i knew then i had to get over my social anxiety and let then know i have no idea what im doing to place such orders . Lol. They helped me through it and the guy .. proably the manager or owner, i dont know ,was so nice to me and generous that he gave me some free Samoas to try as well as his baklava.  Needless to say i have frequently returned to this location and if i havent returned, im ordering . Its so good. The shwarmas are so fresh and amazing. Also ordering is in a subway sorta of fashion. Its fast and easy .  And the prices are really nice reasonable.  Amazing job you guys"}
{"text":"I tried this place yesterday simply because I was craving a donair. I am happy to say this was one of the best donairs I have had in a long time. The service was friendly and quick. The garlic sauce was amazing, even better than anything I have had in Halifax. I will definitely be back!"}
