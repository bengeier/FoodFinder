{"text":"Not sure why everyone loves this place?

Got barbacoa, chicken tinga and carne asada tacos. All were  not fresh tasting. Meat over done. Carne asada had no sauce or toppings on it. I asked for empanadas or tamales.  They did not have stock. At 6 pm in the middle of dinner service there should not be a shortage of food. 
All in all for the price and the quality, not worth it."}
{"text":"Food was okay not as great as queen street tho"}
{"text":"Argentinian Empanadas (Spiced Ground Beef, Boiled Egg, Green Olive, Chimichurri Sauce, 2 for $6.95)

Without a doubt, the empanadas are really where the GG shine. Served piping hot and beautifully golden, the filling has a perfect balance of salty olive, aromatic beef, and creamy egg while the paprika tinted chimichurri gives each bite a little kick. I could just make a meal of these for sure.

Nachos (Cheese, Pico de Gallo, Black Beans, Guac, Chipotle Aioli, Ranchero Salsa with Chorizo, $7.95)

Despite the generous portion, these nachos did not last long at our table. The GG obviously understand the science behind nachos- that chips need to be layered to avoid the dreaded bald patches. I was impressed that despite the mountains of toppings, the freshly fried chips stayed surprisingly crisp. I also really loved the salty bite of the chorizo on there. As a heat lover, though, I did find myself searching for a bit more of a kick or acid to cut the fat from the layers of cheese, creamy aioli and guac, but once I added on some hot sauce and tomatillo salsa served at the table I was good to go.  

Tamales (Pork Belly, Black Beans, Pico de Gallo, Chipotle Aioli, Queso Fresco, $6.95)

Tamales are one of my all time favourite Mexican treats and so few restaurants actually do them, so I was thrilled that this one turned out to be so delicious. The pork was juicy and fatty to compliment the mildly sweet moist base of masa, and I liked the spicy tang from the aioli as well. A pretty generous portion for the price I thought too, so this is for sure a repeat order.

Salvadorian Pupusas (Stuffed with Chicharron, Black Beans, Cheese, Tomatillo, Slaw, $6.95)

Tasty, but I definitely preferred the tamale. I really liked the well balanced filling- the crispy fried pork rinds, the smoky black beans, the salty cheese, but I wanted more of it in ratio to the less moist exterior of the corn tortilla. Maybe if the tortilla was thinner, it would have felt less dense. I also think adding a bit of the aioli on top, while I'm sure not traditional, would have moistened up the works more so then the vinegar based slaw. 

Fish Tacos (Beer Battered Mahi Mahi, Guacamole, Chipotle Aioli, Slaw, $8.95)

There is a reason why GG is thought of as having some of the best fish tacos in the city. The fish is perfectly cooked so that it's juicy and moist inside but packs a wicked crunch with each bite. I also really love their chipotle aioli here- it definitely adds that perfect balance of acidity and heat to the neutral flavour of the white fish. My only wish would be that they doubled up their taco shells because these babies are packed pretty full with all that slaw and fish. Definitely not date night eats, folks, unless you're date is cool with guacamole all over your hands and face (mine is a bit of a party pooper with those things, boo).

Pork Carnitas Quesadilla ($9.95)

Surprisingly one of the most simple dishes we had, and no, it's nothing sexy to look at, but for some reason it's stupid tasty. There isn't a lot of meat in there, but I'm okay with that because the cheese tastes so melty, salty, and good. I don't even know what kind of cheese they're using in there, but it tastes embarrassingly good. It actually reminds me a bit of the grilled cheese I used to have when I was a kid, and now that I'm an adult, I maybe shouldn't love that flavour soooo much, but man, I can't help what I love, it's a nostalgia thing! We all were full at this point but fought over this damn quesadilla.

Churros with Berry Compote ($3.50)

Usually I like my dulce de leche with my churros, but we all actually quite liked the berry compote which wasn't too sweet but offered a bit of bright acidity to counter balance the sugar coated deep fried rods. The churros themselves were just slightly underdone inside which made them a bit heavy, but I actually don't mind that so much as long as the outside isn't burnt or dry. And thankfully, it was perfect. Super crispy, with lots of ridges going on for tones of cinnamon sugar to latch onto.  

Cheese Empanadas (2 for $6.95)

Ending off on the highest note, these sweet empanadas were killer good. I say if you can only stomach one dessert, then this is the one for you, especially if you don't like dishes that are sweet on sweet like churros. These empanadas are stuffed (like, I'm talking, stuffed so full I don't even know how they get so much cheese in there) with a mild yet savoury cheese and then tossed with simple sugar. So you get a crackle from the sugar, a good solid crunch from the golden dough, and then an explosion of warm melty oozy cheese once you get inside. This solidifies my earlier statement- the GG empanadas rock"}
{"text":"So incredibly disappointed, after waiting forever to check them out I wish I hadn't!  I order the Pork Carnitas Tacos (3 for $10).  Worst tacos I've ever had, even worse than Taco Bell (I hate to even admit I've eaten there).  

First off, they were to have cilantro, guacamole and onion.  The cilantro was wilted and tasteless.  The guacamole was a green mayo-consistency-out-of-a-squeeze-bottle, also tasteless.  Guac should be fresh and chunky! Not half-assed, liquid consistency nor out of a squeeze bottle. Even if it was crappy guac there was barely any on my tacos.  There was no onion, and oddly and disgustingly enough, radish!  Seriously, I don't like radish but who puts it on tacos?  I've lived in Mexico and travelled there all my life and I've never seen radish on a taco.  

Lastly, what made these tacos the WORST I've ever had was they were SOAKED, and I mean SOAKED in oil.  That was ALL I could taste and I literally had oil running down my arm.  I had to wash my hands twice after just to get all the oil off.  I've never left such a bad yet deserving review for ANY food business before but I couldn't NOT warn others!

Their food would humiliate ANYONE from Latin America/South America and it was amateur food at best.  I think I'd stick to Taco Bell however if you do want the BEST tacos (and authentic) in the city visit MEXICAN SALSAS on AUGUSTA!  You WON'T be disappointed!

I didn't even eat all 3 tacos, I could only stomach 1 1/2 before I threw them out!

Buyer beware!"}
{"text":"Really awesome Mexican restaurant close to my work.  I like going over there to eat delish tacos and watch some soccer during my breaks.  The staff is really nice and talkative (just don't disagree with them about soccer they know more than you! lol) and the food is delicious. Some advice if you want to go here, skip the burritos and get tacos instead because they are awesome here.  I've tried a ton of different tacos my favorites are the pork al pastor (when it's available), fish tacos, pork carnitas, beef short ribs and chicken tinga.  I can't comment on the authenticity because I'm not super knowledgeable about  Mexican food but what I can tell you is that the flavours here are simple but delicious.  Top notch place for me.  PS I've never experienced the crazy wait times some people mention here but I've also never called in an order."}
{"text":"I ate at gringos food truck this weekend at the Alliston food truck show, I had the fish tacos and poutine. The tacos were nothing special and a real disappointed for the price. $10 for two small tacos.  The poutine was made with low quality french fries and shredded marble cheese. Cost $10. Very disorienting"}
{"text":"DONT COME HERE FOR TAKE OUT!!!

Went here to get it to go and I swear it was the slowest service every... Like right from the order. I was waiting 10 minutes, and they didnt even say hi. Service: -1 stars 

Then i order and wait the normal amount of time for a burrito, only to realize ITS NOT MY BURRITO.  Finally i ask and they decide they'll make my burrito. And after 30 mins its finally ready. Decent burrito, nice atmosphere, service that's legal torture, so all in all dont get takeout, and maybe get a combo the navhos looked good."}
{"text":"I was with two friends at the Jazz Festival last night and had a pretty terrible experience at this restaurant. My friend needed to pee really badly so we walked in and she went straight for the bathroom while my other friend and I looked at the menu. She was then yelled at by an older man (who we assumed was the owner). 

It was not busy at the time and the yelling was really distracting and rude. He said the bathrooms were for customers only. My other friend decided to buy a drink (as the friend who has to pee didn't want one because she NEEDED TO PEE). This didn't work and the man again yelled at all of us to leave. I guess we assumed that if one person bought something, one person could use the bathroom. I guess not. The whole situation was not only awkward for us, but for all the other people eating in the place. 

A young woman did apologize to us for the rude behavior (which was sweet) but I think it's safe to say, that we will never eat there. Who cares about the food when the service is that horrible?"}
{"text":"Granted I lived in California for several years, so my expectations may be high when it comes to Mexican food, but any way you slice it this place was just bad.

I phoned in an order and was told it would be ready in 15 minutes.  I arrived (15 minutes later) and I watched about 20 more minutes of Ms. Doubtfire on their TV before my order was close to filled.

Half of my order was ready when I first arrived, so by the time the rest was done, it had been sitting for at least 25 minutes.

We ordered Fish tacos, carnitas tacos, barecoa quesadilla and chips with guac.  My wife and I really wanted to like this.  We want to find good Mexican, but the guac was so bland and whipped it needed a Gerber label on it.  It spread as easy as margarine.  The chips were over-fried flour tortillas.  Being over-cooked made them very greasy.

The fish tacos were also very oily and tasted surprisingly fishy.  It was a large piece of fish, but it was burried in a massive cascade of vinegary cabbage.  Still, it was not specifically bad, just not very good.

The carnitas were dry, dull and flavorless.  There was a large amount of meat, but since it was not enjoyable eating this taco quickly became a chore.

The most flavorful item of the menu was the quesedilla.  It was, however, dripping with oil and soggy.  

We ended up throwing most of a nearly $50 meal away.  We really wanted to like this, but from service to flavor to price we were taken advantage of.

I would not recommend this place or chain to anyone I like or respect."}
{"text":"Don't judge a burrito by its truck!  

With the recent explosion of food trucks in Toronto... the options for on-the-go and late-night meals are blasted wide open.  And with twitter and facebook its easy to track your favourites....  Food trucks are the \"pop-up shops\" of the restaurant world!  But when I think \"truck\" I still think \"fast food\", \"fozen food\" and \"unhealthy\"....  Well!  The Gourmet Gringos sank all those subs in one delicious BITE!  

Toronto's only *gourmet latin* food truck... their burrito is the BEST I have had at *any* location-locked food joint in town.  Whole sliced chicken breast, made-from-scrach guacc, soft tortilla shell,  quality herbs,  freshly-chopped salsa..... mmmmmmmm.....  This kind of quality doesn't usually fall off the back of truck!   But I guess that's why they feed stars on local film shoots, and wheel in to cater large-scale, UP-scale events.  The brilliant part of being mobile, is they can carry their catering operation (everything *including* the kitchen sink) to any wild party location.

But there IS value to having a store front... which is why they just openned a stationary location at St. Claire and Bathurst. 1384 Bathurst St. Yup!  The Gourmet Gringos have a pied-de-terre downtown.  And the neighbourhood is in for a treat!  Not to mention some new friends... nobody is nicer than owners Terry and Krystian:  friends since childhood, they playfully rib each other through 15 hour days of crafting and delivering hundreds of mouth-watering meals across the GTA.  With so much love of quality, cooking and people... its no wonder the Gourmet Gringos food taste so good!   Follow them at @gourmetgringos"}
{"text":"Family owned and run business. Very authentic and delicious Mexican food fare. Really recommend this place, honest price and the best burritos in the east end! (I regularly go there, so I can say service and quality are very consistent, A++++)"}
{"text":"NOTE: since writing this review the business was sold as a franchise and it really isn't the same anymore. the new owners are really nice, actually nicer than the old ones. they don't have gluten free burritos anymore, nor do they have soup. the food is also kind of heavy on the sodium. 

_________________________________________________________________________________

i first tried them at the Toronto Outdoor Art Show and they were amazing!  I got chicken tacos for myself and they gave me a few churros. The tacos were AMAZING! I can't eat wheat, but the people I gave my churros to all proclaimed they were delicious (and their expressions matched). 

GG just opened their stand alone restaurant and i'm going to have to work them into my budget. I've had a chicken burrito and chicken tacos, all on corn wraps, all awesomely amazing. thank you for the corn wraps, i haven't been able to have a burrito in AGES! there was a line-up at dinner time, but once i was able to pay my burrito was assembled quickly - it was their second day open, once they get the feel for the flow of the restaurant things will run smoothly. regardless, it was worth the wait! the second time i went for tacos on a sunday afternoon and everything moved very quickly. 

additionally, i have some pernicious sensitivities to food additives, and nothing made me sick. It is such a relief to finally find people who make food that isn't full of chemicals! 

Much respect to Gourmet Gringos!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for dinner. There were two staff on- the cook and a girl at the counter. As I waited for service. the girl leaned across the counter and started talking to a friend of hers sitting at a nearby table (who I believe was also waiting for food) about personal life stuff- the cook actually had to tell her to serve the customers, as there was also a lady behind me.  

I ordered a taco salad and it was disappointing. I asked for it without cheese but it came with cheese, unfortunately. As I'd already been waiting awhile, I didn't bother to bring it back. The salad was loaded with a strong, sour vinaigrette- while the description did say there would be a dressing, it was overkill. There was a puddle at the bottom of the shell which made it mushy and inedible. Other than a greens mix, there wasn't much to the salad besides a sprinkling of corn and beans (no rice, grilled veggies, guac, etc). Definitely a let-down.

The folks working seemed friendly, but I don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"These guys were at Comi-Con Toronto, along with Food Dudes. I ordered their fish tacos which tasted great. The flavour was all there, but for $11.95 plus tax, there should be a little something more than just cabbage and fish. And I was left still hungry after that. For that price, I'm expecting something filling, at least marginally."}
{"text":"It was a very great experience in this restaurant every thing fresh. Warm place u feel this restaurant build to make people happy. I really recommend if you want try real Mexican food"}
{"text":"We picked up a take out order of quesadillas and a burrito and a side of chips with guacamole.     Gourmet it's not.     I eat sour cream many times a week, but this was the first time that I've ever tasted it 'off'
We waited over a half hour for our food.  And there were no other customers in the place.    The person cooking apparently usually 'manages' the food truck and the first order of chips she tried to make were a disaster. She had to try again. There's another Mexican fast food place opened up by Kew Gardens and they're very, very, good.    I wanted to say something positive ......I was happy that there was corn added to my veggie quesadillas. However, this is not what I would consider gourmet.  And if it was, it definitely would have been worth the 1/2 hour prep time.    Good luck Gourmet Gringos."}
{"text":"Definitely worth checking out! 
Still some kinks but should smooth out with time. 
We ordered a short rib burrito and fish tacos.

I also ordered a pineapple jumex and my fiancé wasn't sure what to drink. They suggested a Tamaran jumex and when they sensed his hesitation they offered to refund it if he did not like it. That is top notch service in my opinion. 

Pros:
Hot sauce!!!! Finally! I'm so sick of wimp burritos in the PATH with no jalepenos or hot sauce, this stuff was a real treat!
Staff - very friendly, told me the secrets behind the hot sauce 
Location - our hood was desperate for a take out burrito place (you can sit and eat here too)
Choices - fish tacos, burritos, various meats, nachos, quesadillas etc. Nice variety of menu options and toppings 

Cons:
Little greasy/ watery on the burrito
Hot sauce was gathered in ends and not throughout
Fish tacos were a bit dry - great flavour. We went at 8:40 and they close at 9, so probably not the most fresh time for fish tacos on our part - we had them on the truck In the summer and they were to die for (higher turnover/fresher)


Overall:
Good was great, I will  definitely go back 
Great service
Ask for hot sauce on side maybe?? :)"}
{"text":"pulled pork tacos were yummy!! well priced, well presented. definitely deserve 5 stars!! bringing new flavours to the beaches :)"}
{"text":"We came twice because we couldn't use our entire groupon In one visit, not that we wanted to come again: The service was terrible and unhelpful the food was ok aka mediocre.  The second time we came they were closed when the posted hours said they should be open. Nothing about the place made us want to come back unfortunately. The owners were also very stingy; I asked for some hot sauce to go with my Mexican food (surprise?) the owner handed me I kid you not a thimble sized plastic cup with hot sauce. The girl at the counter must have caught on to the look of \"are you kidding me?\" I was wearing and handed me the bottle (to the protest of the owner). 

The short of it is this: There are many better places you could eat and spend your money on Mexican food."}
{"text":"Still THE BEST mahi mahi tacos in Toronto. And this is comparing to  buster's sea cove, seven lives, la carnita, and grand electric. 
BRAVO."}

{"text":"I think if I didn't know that this storefront started out as a truck I'd be a bit disappointed. The shrimp tacos were tasty enough, the panko-crusted shrimp crispy and the poblano corn salsa a great complement. But $11 and three tacos later I was still hungry, and the kid's quesadilla was just as (proportionately) small -- $5 should probably buy you more than two taco shells filled with shredded cheese and a small bowl of white rice. Basically, everything was well-made and tasted good, but we left feeling a bit unsatisfied. I'd rather go to Asasa further along St Clair: more variety and heartier, just as fresh and tasty, just as quality ingredients."}
{"text":"After a horrible experience with their fan expo food truck I decided to give them one more try at their beaches location. I ordered a vegetarian burrito and it was the worst burrito I've ever had. It was extremely bland and filled with plain rice. Some of the rice was under-cooked and was still crunchy. There was a tiny bit of cheese and a lot of burrito sauce which just tasted like mayonnaise. As for vegetables there was only 2 skinny slices of roasted red pepper and a small amount of corn and black beans. Not much for a vegetarian burrito. There's nothing gourmet about this place!"}
{"text":"Person on the phone was kind of rude and had trouble understanding me to take the order. Maybe she shouldn't answer the phone? Asked for a simple substitution and she kind of sighed annoyed, said they'd do it for me \"this time\". It's just pre-cooked rice and beans, you didn't donate a kidney. Either just say no or don't act like its a big favour because I'm actually paying, remember?

The nachos were gross and almost cheese-less. The fish tacos had only a few large shreds of cabbage. Bland. 

When the delivery guy is the highlight of your dealing with them..."}
{"text":"They were in my neighbourhood so decided to give them a try.  Ordered the beer battered fish tacos.  The flavour was ok but the taco was topped with so much red cabbage it totally made the batter on the fish soggy. Gross."}
{"text":"This review is for the bricks & mortar store at Bathurst & St. Clair.  Also, we visited on what I believe was their 2nd night of being open.

I wanted to like this so badly, given that it is literally a 3 minute walk from my house.  We had dreams of Tuesday Taco night from one of the best in the city.

Unfortunately those dreams were crushed in a 45min span.

First, the layout of the space is really quite terrible.  They have the ordering area tucked into a small corner that is also used as the through-fare for food coming out of the kitchen. This means that the line-up of people waiting to order is directly in the way of staff running food.

The drinks are not listed on the menu, and the open fridge is not within eyesight of the ordering counter.  This meant that the staff member had to duck in behind the guy making the tacos to see the fridge and yell over to us the selection on hand.  Of course, I would have just peeked over myself but I couldn't even see where the drinks were...did they have drinks?

I witnessed several orders come out wrong, and then wrong again.  To be fair, the staff was apologetic and always had a kind smile, and even offered a table a freebie for their delayed food.  But it just all felt very chaotic, understaffed and unorganized.

Other items to mention that could be fixed for future:

Staff bring out your food to you, but they don't bring you any cutlery.  This means that you then have to get up again after they drop it off, and head back into the tiny zone where the people are lined up, and the staff are running through and its just a crowded mess.  Seems obvious, but if the staff aren't going to bring the cutlery with them, they should direct you to grab it after you order as you head to your table.  I saw every table in the place experience this, so I know it wasn't just my oversight.

The sauces on the table are mild and hot salsas but are in ketchup and mustard bottles.  Confusing as they are unmarked.  Until I overheard a staff member tell another table differently, I thought it was actually ketchup and mustard.

The food is quite messy, and although there are napkins on the table they are those flimsy tissue paper jobbies.  Okay...but best to offer wet naps too then, considering that this is pretty much all finger food (save for soups and salads).

The speaker system is only set up over the ordering counter, which is practically in the kitchen.  So, the music is loud and festive when you are ordering your food, and then when you sit down in the eating area there is a quiet din that just doesn't feel right.  They need to have at least one speaker in the front of house

There are no accessible garbage bins, so you are forced to leave your food baskets, soda cans, used napkins, etc on the table as you leave.  I am happy to pick up after myself, and leave the table clean for the next person, but their system didn't allow for that.  It meant that the one staffer who is taking orders and running food is also clearing tables.  This is not a table service restaurant so it seems they are doing themselves a disservice.

Finally, the food.  It was okay.  Maybe it was just what we ordered, but I really didn't have a \"well, that makes it all worth it\" kind of experience.  My fish taco was fairly boring, overdressed with coleslaw and thus fell apart into a sopping mess.  The guacamole was flavourless, I don't think there was any seasoning whatsoever and the chips were also dry and boring (no salty goodness).

I wrote this review most specifically for the restaurant owners as they seem like good people and I really want to help them succeed however I can.  I believe in the small business owner and want to support them whenever possible.  At this point, I feel that my feedback is the most valuable thing I can provide.  

Best of luck GG's!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on Sunday late afternoon. Had the fish tacos.  I had heard of 'fish' tacos before but had thought yuk.  But this was awesome.  What's not to like about beer batter fried white fish.  Was really good. Had the fresh fried chips, a bit greasy but still ok.  Will definitely go again and soon. They have a TV and I find that annoying in any establishment.  Perhaps some Latin or contemporary Mexican music might be better."}
{"text":"This is a review of their food truck which I happened across at a recent event that I went to. 

We got three tacos for $10 (chicken, short rib and pork) and also the short rib burrito. I thought the tacos were just OK - definitely nothing to write home about, and left me unsatisfied. I echo a previous reviewer when they said there was excess cheese in the burrito with a lot of rice. At least it was filling. 

Meh - not sure I'm a repeat customer. ."}

{"text":"Food is satisfactory but customer service is seriously lacking.

When I first visited Gourmet Gringos I experienced excellent customer service and had a delicious Chicken Tinga burrito. However my last three trips to this establishment have been less than satisfactory. On two occasions I called in advance to pick up my meal, both times I was told it would be ready in ten minutes, and both times when I arrived no one had even started making the food.  On another occasion I had requested \"no beans\" and was given a burrito with absolutely no sauce. 

Will be taking my business to Burrito Bandidos on Queen and Coxwell."}
{"text":"Great Mexican/Latin food! Food's made from scratch, very natural, etc.  I know it's bad to draw comparisons, but this ranks just below Seven Lives in taste, and is further behind in price.  However, when in the area, I'd definitely eat there again! A true find!"}
{"text":"Not a bad selection.

Ordered the baha fish tacos x 3.
Asked for it to be spicy.. Barely any spice.
Fish size isn't bad, and it's pretty flavourful.

Also ordered a side of their guacamole and chips.
Probably one of the worst guac and chips I've had. First the chips are pretty much from a generic store bought brand. Pretty thin, and break when trying to dip into the guac. The GUAC was the worst. When I order guacamole, I expect just guac, not tomato and onions on top. This isn't salsa, and definitely not what I wanted. (Honestly, please don't sell guacamole when it's clearly been sitting in the fridge all day and who know when it was made - taste very old)

It only gets a 3 star because the fish tacos weren't so bad, but won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"I am a mexican, the food is not that good, it arrived cold and my order was incomplete. I called to ask for the rest of my order and they said they would take it and it never arrived.... You lost a really good posible client"}
{"text":"I visited this truck quite a while ago, and I got the pork and chicken tacos, for $7 I think. I really enjoyed the flavour of the taco fillings, though I kinda wished that the taco shell could be less floury since it detracted from the taste of the taco as a whole. Overall though, I really liked this truck, and would surely return if given the opportunity! Excellent truck to help spread the food truck movement in Toronto."}
{"text":"I dined in at Gourmet Gringos yesterday evening with my girlfriend. Right away I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the great customer service. We both ordered 3 fish tacos and sat down. Our food was brought out fairly quickly and the staff checked in to ask us how it was after a few minutes. The tacos were delicious and huge! The portions were nice and generous. The ingredients were fresh and flavourful. Overall a great experience and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Beer battered mahi mahi tacos were pretty meh.  They looked good, had nice crunch, but there was very little flavour other than the citrus which came from the lime.  I really wanted it to be better.  Oh well."}
{"text":"There was a lack of \"burritos\" in The Beach for the longest time, now they're springing up all over. At last count now including Gourmet Gringos I count 4 on Queen street between Coxwell and Glen Manor. 
I just had lunch here today. My wife and I both ordered the beef Burritos. 
I have to say that I found the food very bland and have to pay extra for fresh made guacamole which tasted to me like it was just creamed avacodo with no flavour added at all. We ordered a side of chips with guacamole which were extremely greasy. 
I was asked how everything was and I said the chips were very greasy, and we'd barely eaten any, and wasn't even offered a refund. 
Maybe I'm a burrito snob but I'm going to stick with Burrito Bandidos at Coxwell. They still know how to do everything right, and they have the best bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this truck and was lucky enough to see it at the auto show.  We ordered 5 tacos to share, short ribs was amazing and had a creamy texture that was soooooo savoury.  Chicken tinga was equally as good and the pork carnitas, our least favourite, was still super tasty.  They were so good we went back and ordered three more!  Aside from great ingredients and flavour, I love that they use proper corn tortillas.  Throw in their perfect hot sauce, great mix of heat and flavour, and this is one of the tastiest tacos in Toronto.

I can't give it a five because the prices are out of control, like most food trucks.  Five tacos and two drinks was close to $30 bucks, that's insane!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for fish tacos. Everything was prepared fresh when i ordered and they had it ready for me in just minutes. In addition to their super friendly staff, the atmosphere was positive, the service was top-notch and most importantly, the food was AMAZING. Will definitely be coming back to try the rest of the menu. When I'm craving for Mexican food, gourmet gringos will always be the first place I think of!"}
{"text":"Ate twice at their food truck - the fish tacos and chorizo are delicious!!! 

Ate at their location at St Clair West last night, food wasn't as great as the food truck and for some reason I got food poisoning later that night... Not fun."}
{"text":"(Food Truck)  Ordered the pork, chorizo, and short rib tacos and then two of the fish tacos.  I think the three meats were a bit too oily, and it distracted from the flavours.  The fish tacos were pretty tasty, but the fish felt a bit too big for the amount of taco skin given.  But the taste was alright (unlike the Buster Sea Cove where it just has a stinging spice in your mouth)."}
{"text":"Went Tuesday lunchtime. Food stale and cold when served. Staff were polite but the food just looked iffy."}
{"text":"I was passing by after a night out when they were situated out front of the Bloor Cinema during TIFF.

Luckily I just managed to beat out a line up that formed right after I ordered.  

I ordered the deep fried Mahi Mahi taco which was fantastic.  Took a bit of time but nothing too long for something made to order.  Although I think I'd warn mi amigos to have a bit of patience if a group suddenly forms because all good things take a bit of time.

My ONLY little thing is the portion size, with two small tacos @ $9, I gobbled it all before I even made the next block which made me want to turn around and head back to get me some more.  Having ordered from Gourmet Bitches in the past however, I think these portion sizes along the line of everyone else.  I am a bit more used to Miami and NY's Food truck scene where portions are a bit more generous.

Other than that, I am muchos contento for Gourmet Gringos.

Hopefully we can andale andale arriba arriba, vamanos with the revamp of the antiquated Food Truck laws in Toronto!"}
{"text":"First and foremost I have to give GG props for being able to make the seamless transition from food truck to actual brick and mortar establishment, this is no easy feat!  So congrats.  

I have been to the Beach location on many an occasion and have never been disappointed.  The burritos are a carnivores dream, if you get meat of course.  you can literally eat half for dinner and take the 2nd half for lunch the next day, THAT is how filling they are.  I stick to my tried, tested and true half chicken tinga, half chorizo burrito combination.  All burritos come with rice, black beans, pico de gallo, and shredded cheese, add an extra 1$ and you get satisfyingly creamy guac. 
 
The Argentinian Empanadas with Chimichurri sauce are also a solid choice, but if you want to be gut-busting full opt for a large burrito, it will never disappoint! The Beach location is super quiet to eat in, and in nice weather you can grab your food to go and enjoy close by Kew Gardens."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Toronto food trucks!  You first choose your vessel: 
Quesadilla
Burrito
Taco

Then the meat.  Tacos are 2/$7 except for the Mahi Mahi (2/$9).  Burritos/Quesadillas are $8.

I have tried:

Mole Braised Short Rib Burritos
Beer Battered Mahi Mahi Tacos
Carnitas Quesadillas

If you are extra hungry, stick with either the quesadillas or the burritos - they will fill you up to the nines!  

If I had to choose a favourite - it would have to be the Mahi Mahi tacos.  But suffice it to say I haven't tried 1 thing I don't like here.

If you want quality Latin American food, look no further!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out during my severe taco craving. Came to find that they weren't that good for the price. Really stale tortillas, bland chicken and such a small portion of it as well. Overall really disappointed."}
{"text":"Must eat! I'd been craving good Mexican food for a while here in Toronto. Thursday I finally tried Gourmet Gringos.  All I can say is OMG so good. We've ordered 3 times since. Yes three times in 4 days. Their service is as good as their food. Do yourself a favour and try them out!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I stopped by for a quick dinner here after having tacos at another location (Aurora). We were a bit disappointed with the quality of food here after having a good experience at the other location. We ordered 3 tacos (chicken tinga, chorizo, and a beef one) and a taco salad. The chicken tinga taco was delicious and perfectly topped. It was the first taco we had, so it set the bar high for the other two. The chorizo taco was dry and definitely missing something. It had a drizzle of guacamole and a whole lot of chopped red onion on it. When we had the beef taco, we were disappointed because it was also dry and lacking. We asked for the chipotle aioli they put on the chicken tinga taco and the guy at the counter happily gave it to us without a charge. The taco salad was alright. A lot of cheese and not much else. The salad comes with guacamole for you to dip your taco shell in, but I really wasn't feeling the taco shell or guacamole. Their guacamole is way too smooth. I'm used to it being chunkier. The texture kind of reminded me of baby food.

Service was friendly. We were their last customers and dined in, so when we were finishing up and ready to clean up after ourselves, the guy at the counter told us he would do it for us, which was nice."}
{"text":"Review for the food truck only.  

I tried this place out at the King City Craft Beer and Food Truck festival.  It wasn't cheap, but reasonable as you could get 3 tacos for $10.  For the 3 tacos, I had chicken, beef and chorizo.  

Likes:
-All the ingredients (including the toppings) were very fresh.
-Chorizo had a nice kick to it and when you add the hot sauce, bam, amazeballs.  

Dislikes:
-you had to ask for hot sauce, and they seemed unwilling to give it.  I'm sorry, but we're paying 20-30% premium for your product, you should offer all possible condiments to your customers and not have them ask for it.  

Overall, I would try this place again and try out the fish tacos since I loved the chorizo, however I thought the chicken and beef were just average."}
{"text":"Had delivery from here last night via fodora... chicken and pork tacos. Totally dry, not even a bit of sauce or juiciness for the tacos. The cheese quesadillas was a joke. This food is not good."}
{"text":"Tried the fish tacos and it was the best I have had outside of Mexico

Would definitely return to try again

The other with me tried the short rib taco and was not as impressed as I was 

From my personal experience I would have gave them a five but docked them a point for disappointing on others meal"}
{"text":"The house-made guacamole is quite tasty (it is heavier on the tomatoes and less on the onions if that is your jam) when served with tortilla chips that have been freshly fried.

I had the one of the barbacoa, pork carnitas, and the chorizo tacos for my main and they were definitely tasty.  I think my favourite that day was the barbacoa.

Service is speedy and the staff are happy to provide you with their recommendations."}
{"text":"Excellent Authentic Mexican Food with very friendly service! The fresh chips are to die for! Well priced and delish - about time we got a real Mexican place in the hood!"}
{"text":"This place was the worst. All the ingredients on display are all dried out and shriveled. They did a price switch up on me and tried charging me two dollars more for my burrito...it's because the listed prices were wrong, so like why is that happening? I ended up cancelling my order like 2 seconds after I placed it, because the whole situation was awkward. The person serving me couldn't really speak English which made it even more awkward and stressful. Oh, and I saw them make a bunch of food after touching money and without washing their hands. I'm sure that happens everywhere, but if you're going to be preparing food with an audience, you may want to at least pretend to be clean."}
{"text":"Got delivery today short rib burritos and fish tacos .. fish tacos good flavor but beware it is not boneless  .. steak burritos were sold our so we had the short beef which were a little salty"}
{"text":"not much Gourmet or Gringo about these guys.

First the good stuff:
    Line up was short
    Service was fast and polite.
    Double layer of taco shells on each Taco is a nice touch.

Everything Else:
   Got my simple order wrong.  Instead of one beef tongue and one pork, ended up with two pork.  Of course I didn't notice until I'd already walked a good distance and found a nice place to eat.
    Pulled pork basically had no sauce.  It was overcooked, dry, and not much flavour.
    Toppings- might have saved the taco, but a tiny spoon of guac and a sprinkle of lettuce and green onion just didn't do it for me.
    Taco shells were mushy even though they're double layered.  Could have been avoided... I'll suggest TOASTING them on the grill for 30s before filling them- works wonders.

Bottom Line:
   When I'm paying $3.50/taco I expect better, especially with a ton of great taco options in Toronto.
ex. Check out Salt Wine Bar for Taco Tuesdays.  (yes, used to work there but I still go back for their killer tacos now that I don't)"}
{"text":"Do not go to this restaurant! I honestly never write reviews but I was so disgusted by this place I had to.
First of all, the service was terrible. It took forever for them to make my food and the staff were not friendly what so ever. Secondly, the food is terrible. I ordered the fish tacos because I usually love them but they were absolutely disgusting from this restaurant. The ingredients they use do not taste fresh and the tortillas taste awful and processed. Finally, to top it all off, I got food poisoning from the tacos! I have been sick for a day and a half thus far. 
Please do your taste buds and your stomach a favour and NEVER order food from this restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 fish tacos, 2 beef short rib tacos and a pork carnitas one to go.  We had the unfortunate luck of ordering just as friends of the chef and/or owners walked in.  I was told my order would take 5 minutes, so we walked down the street and came back 15 minutes later I was still waiting for my order while their friends were being served.  

It would have been nice if they were able to better level set their customers because 15 minutes is 3 times longer than 5 minutes just saying.  And if my money isn't good here thy should just say so, there's lots of other food options in the area.

The fish tacos were good, the pork was salty, and the beef was good too.  Soft taco shells seems to be the standard and they double shell it.  It was tasty enough but I don't think I'd give them another shot due o down right poor service.  

P.S.  It wasn't even busy.  The people before me had already taken their food to go."}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem!  I've been in Toronto for a long time and have visited every Mexican restaurant I can find, oddly enough my mistake was not waiting for the food to come to me!

Gourmet Gringos prepared two fresh burritos, one beef and one vegetable.  My wife thoroughly enjoyed her vegan burrito.  Hanging onto this point, and anyone who's dated, married, or known a vegan will appreciate this.  When I ordered, I specifically stated my wife was vegan.  Not only did the guy make note of it, but actually took the time to repeatedly remind the food prep and cook that the burrito being made was for a vegan.  Most kitchens simply receive that note on the order check and either catch it, or don't.

The beef was cooked perfectly.  Not too dry but not so moist that it was suffering from typical faux burrito problems like the requisition of a drain prior to eating just to catch the five litres of water coming out of it (I never understood the Canadian need to drown food in water).

Having said all of this, the food was fantastic and we will definitely be ordering from them whenever I find their truck!"}
{"text":"Had 3 fish tacos and they were nicely prepared. Not much of an ambience for sitting in. A little expensive for what you get, but will go back."}
{"text":"This shop is tucked away south of St. Clair on Bathurst st.

There was no-one there when I went in on a Saturday morning after 11:30.  The staff was friendly, price was comparable to what I paid when they were at the Ex.

I got the 2 mahi mahi tacos, 3 short rib tacos.  Total price was around $22.00.

For what I paid, I was left hungry...The fish tacos were good but they were really small...I got two small pieces of fish the size of my finger.  

The short rib tacos were a bit dry but I think it's because I had to wait a long time for the buses to get home and well temperature affected that.  Also small but I guess it's quality over quantity right?!

I'd come back here again but definately need to bring my fat wallet before I venture in here again."}
{"text":"If you're getting Mexican food in Toronto, you're pretty much gonna get a mediocre meal, and gourmet gringos is no exception. Leaving aside the weird choice of a name, \"A-OK\" is probably the perfect description for the overall experience. It's close to me so I used to go fairly frequently but it never really lived up to my hopes. The people working there are the opposite of enthusiastic and the food is solidly bland. If you're dying for Mexican food, Asada isn't too far away."}
{"text":"I can see why this place does well as a food truck but they need to realize that they lose some of that uniqueness when they open a storefront.

I ordered the fish tacos because these days everyone is talking about the fish taco craze (don't ask me why). For $12, you get two tiny beer-battered mahi-mahi filets surrounded by a soft tortilla covered with some coleslaw. it's not a memorable meal. The fish was tasteless, except for the heat from an unidentified spice. the coleslaw was right on target and balanced the fish well.

I can't see myself coming back here voluntarily. However, I can see them continuing their success in the food truck business."}
{"text":"This review is for the food truck and the Mahi Mahi Fish Tacos only ($10 for 2).  The fish tacos were decent compared to the options in Toronto, but on and in themselves, they were meh.  I realize that the ratio between the cabbage, salsa, onion and cilantro is a chef interpretation, but Gringos' ratio is not my fave.  Somehow the tacos didn't taste refreshing or fragrant."}
{"text":"Love the food here, it's great to finally be able to go to a location and pick up take out, when you can't make it out to a foodtruck. You must check it out!!!"}
{"text":"Had take away the other night from here. Got the pulled pork tacos. They were really good and had plenty of filling. 

They are so well priced also and the portions are very generous. Going back for lunch there today to try something else. 

Finally, a great Mexican in the beaches. Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak burrito from here and was very disappointed. The steak pieces were cold and there was way too much rice and not enough steak. I also asked for it to be spicy and it was barely spicy. 

It's too bad because this place has potential. I've ordered a burrito from here before and it was was superb.  My recommendation is  greater attention to detail (ie: don't serve the meat piping cold and use the right portion of rice to meat)."}
{"text":"2 hour wait for what exactly? The fries supreme was made with dollar store quality cheese. The chicken tacos and burrito meat was sold out so they just used chicken fingers. The burger was just a regular burger with the same toppings as fries supreme. And it was $10 an item. Wow."}
{"text":"lol, i wonder if i'm the only one who thought this. but it was expensive. got mahi mahi tacos 2 for 9$ which were super tiny but was tasty (deep fried, with tasty sauce and crunchy cabbage).  was around the same size as the taco bell soft shell tacos. but don't get me wrong, it wasn't awful. was pretty good, but not worth it's price. guess you pay a premium for truck food. i admit i was satisfied after. 
i give a one thumbs up! i wouldn't go searching for this truck though."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Toronto I have to get their fish tacos. They're really filling and I wish I could eat more of them. I usually get 3, but if you don't have a big appetite then only get 2. The family who owns the franchise is really friendly and if you have the choice, come to this location. Amazing service and food!"}
{"text":"Gourmet Gringos is an unfortunate example of how even the best idea can be undermined by poor execution. 

I first heard about GG through my foodie friends; one of the first waves of food trucks that took Toronto by storm a couple of years ago. Their fun and portable take on mexican food brought them legions of fans. 

So imagine my delight when they opened a bricks and mortar location in my neighbourhood, just as my wife an I moved in. 

It had to be fate.

Even better, they promised delivery, combining two great ideas: mexican food and sitting on our butts waiting for someone to feed us. 

Excited, we placed an order for chicken tinga and carnitas burritos, with a side of guacamole and nachos. 

We waited, and waited, and waited. Longer than expected, but we've waited longer. 

The food came lukewarm, but we've had colder. 

We were impressed that they threw in a couple of soups...less so when it became apparent that said soups were basically canned cream of mushroom. But we've had worse.  

Around $35 for two, but we've had more expensive. 

Overall, the portions were stingy...but we'be been hungrier. 

But I'll tell you what was abundant: raw onion.

Like seriously, never in my life have I eaten food more beset by raw white onion. It's like they ran short of other ingredients...like avocado, or chicken, or pork, or water, and just decided \"hey, let's just throw some more raw white onion in. They'll never notice, and who doesn't love raw onion?\"

Let me be clear: i'm no onion bigot. Onions lie at the heart of most things I cook and enjoy eating. French onion soup for example, with it's deeply caramelized alium base, if one of my all time faves. Raw onion burrito, not so much. 

So much onion. like finding ants in your picnic basket, or bedbugs in your hotel sheets. 

My wife was reduced to picking tiny onion dice out of her tortilla, one at a time; then scanning the burrito's entrails before hazarding another bite. 

Me, I grinned and bore it, then brushed my teeth for 45 minutes and rinsed with a gallon of Listerine until the insides of my cheeks squeaked. 

So yeah; if we feel like mexican but don't want to go out, this gringo will stick to his own kitchen. 

At least I cook my onions."}
{"text":"Gotta say the selection of burrito toppings has cratered and staff are starting to get stingy with the few that are left.  Get more than one order at a time and staff slow to a crawl.  Still a fan, though."}
{"text":"We had the Gringos food truck stop by my office a few weeks ago offering a couple menu items.  The Baha Fish Tacos and the Beef Short Rib Tacos.  I decided to take break from red meat as my prostate would probably thank me and opted for the seafood alternative.  the Baha taco comprised of Beer battered Mahi Mahi, guacamole, cole slaw, chipotle aioli.  The fish itself was not too flavourful, and the batter was only crisp on the ends, the bulk of the body of the fish battered was soft.  The winning element of this menu item was the chipotle aioli, it was sharp, spicy, and on point.

3 Stars"}
{"text":"After my last review I was invited back to try Gourmet Gringos again. This time around, it was a completely different story.

Fish Tacos. Amazing.
Mole Braised Beef Short Rib Burrito. Amazing.

It was like night and day coming back here. It was really busy this last Sunday as the gringos were sitting at the Queen West Art Crawl. Orders were taking a good 15 minutes because they were so busy. This turned some people away but trust me, it's worth the wait.

Let's talk about the fish tacos first. Beer battered mahi mahi, cabbage, guac, and a chipotle sauce on a delicious corn tortilla. The fish was piping hot and had a great ratio of fish to batter. The cabbage was nice and crunchy adding to the texture palette. The chipotle sauce was a nice point of difference from the lime creme that traditionally comes on a baja fish taco. The corn tortillas are a little larger than average which helped to make sure all the great toppings went in my mouth and not on the ground.

The burrito, what can I say? Gooey, melty, deliciousness in a tortilla. The beef was so tender with a nice fattiness to it that added a great flavour. There was a healthy amount of cheese which you can never go wrong with. The burrito disappeared quite fast.

Thank-you for an excellent lunch gringos!"}
{"text":"Gourmet Gringos is the only Food Truck my friend wanted to try out of all that's available during Nuit Blanche event. And I am glad that I finally get to try out their tacos!

We tried:

Beer Battered Mahi Mahi (2/$9)
Chicken (2/$7)
Pork (2/$7)

Fish taco definitely the best out of the 3 we tried! My friends just chowed down all the tacos in record speed. 

The line for Gourmet Gringos was surprisingly short during the event and the wait time for other other to be ready was around 10-15 minute.  Definitely worth the wait especially all the food is made to order!

I definitely want to have some more Mahi Mahi tacos next time when I bump into Gourmet Gringos again! And extra hot sauce please!! :)"}
{"text":"Holy crap if you're vegan or omnivore you need to get in here. This is food so good you'll lick the paper wrapping after you're done. Highly recommend getting the Pico de Gallo on your burrito. Guacamole is fresh, portions are satisfying!"}
{"text":"Went to gourmet gringos today, I had the best fish tacos ever. They're made to order, but it's worth the wait. If I could give them more then five stars I would. A must try if your in the beaches!"}
{"text":"This is only based on the short rib burrito that I ordered. Short rib burrito was loaded with rice, cheese, beans and short ribs. it was a bit greasy to my liking due to the excess amount of melted cheese. Short ribs was a bit over salted. Value:10 bucks for a burrito? There are a lot of options for that price. The price and taste is a little too rich for my blood."}
