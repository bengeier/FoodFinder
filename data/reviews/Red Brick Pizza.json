{"text":"I've been on a pizza diet as of late, and actually tried a Red Brick closer to my house before trying this one.   This one was equally as good as the first one I tried! The people are friendly and to-go orders have been quick. I've been here a few times over the last month or so, and always equally as good.   As a creature of habit, I always get the same thing - basically it's a supreme and I get it minus the black olives. SO GOOD!   I will definitely be back! I love this place!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for gourmet pizza, this is not the place for you.  It is a chain restaurant in a shopping plaza, so keep your expectations realistic.  The food is pretty much on par but a bit on the expensive side.  But if you're looking for chain pizza, this is on the better end of the spectrum.  If you're looking for gourmet pizza, drive 15 minutes and go to Pizzeria Bianco - voted the best in the nation.  Don't go to McDonald's expecting Kobe beef burgers, and don't go to Red Brick expecting Pizzeria Bianco. Just keep your expectations realistic and you will leave with a smile."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, quick service, next to a theatre. What better place to go when you are at Mesa Riverview.  Got to try their Fhazani sandwich and Gelato!!"}
{"text":"this pizza is so so. i get pizza there for my husband and son. they seem to like it and they have a coupon card. so every pizza you order you get some $ off. we paid $2.00 tonight for our pizza. great deal."}
{"text":"Great family place and great pizza. A few tables out front on to enjoy your food outdoors. The pizzas are good and the Fhazani's are awesome. Cant' beat fire roasted foods."}
{"text":"If you like expensive disapointment, then this might be the place for you. If not, go elsewhere.  I had the pepperoni pizza lunch special with a small salad. Cost me north of $8.00. The salad was drenched in dressing. The portion was adequate. The pizza was bland and pretty tasteless. The portion was adequate. I can see why business is slow here."}
{"text":"I thought their pizza was excellent. They are one of the few places that serve gluten free - and GOOD gluten free - pizza. Loved it, and my husband reports their regular crust was good too. I could tell their ingredients were quality. I was really satisfied and ate way too much! This will be my new favorite pizza in Gilbert."}
{"text":"Pricey for unremarkable, generic chain pizza-but they have beer and the outdoor area abuts a pretty nice greenbelt. Lunch here is pretty much the same price as every place else. seemed really slow at lunchtime, which is usually a bad sign.  Wasn't horrible-but I wouldn't go back.  That's my two cents-Which won't matter, cause they'll filter this review like the filter all my others."}
{"text":"Yes...this is a chain restaurant...but none the less... this pizza is pretty good.  The red brick oven concept has been done before and much better, but it is usually much more expensive.  Red Brick is decently priced chain that serves good pizza.  Another cool plus, is when dining in, every booth has it's only TV so you could watch an episode of \"Friends\" while you eat...like we did."}
{"text":"Tried to go to Redbrick last night and found out it closed nine months ago. So if you are in Vegas and want GF Pizza, you gotta look somewhere else."}
{"text":"Well, I went in for the first time today with a Groupon Now deal.  I was totally stoked to try this place out because it's right down the street from my work and I'm sick of the same old same old.  The place was set up very nice and the ambiance was all that of a good lunch place.  I ordered the chicken ceasar salad and the cheesey breadsticks.  The breadsticks were AMAZING.  I was excited to try the salad and when I opened the box it was almost inedible.  The lettuce looked OLD.  It was bruised and slimey.  The chicken had all kinds of cartilage and fattiness.  It was terrible.  Now, I know that they are a pizza place and that is what they specialize in...but if your salads are going to be THAT BAD don't serve them.  It's just gross."}
{"text":"When I stopped by today for lunch-July 9, this Red Brick Pizza was closed.  Not a temporary closure, it was closed for good.  Oh well, another Red Brick gone."}
{"text":"Ahh man, .....I REALLY wanted this to be good.  But honestly, you end up with something that's more like \"flame broiled\" than the earthy wood-fired imagery you pick up from their corporately consistent signage, menu, and decor.  That being said, it's a cool concept, and great crust- but the signature pizzas like the \"Greek\" end up feeling themed ,and lacking of soul and an intuitive fussing-over that they need to really be crack good.  The salad's, while seemingly possessing all the right stuff- are the same. Too salty/ too soggy, and somehow too rich. The gelato tastes like it must come from a squeeze tube.  Anyhow- enough bitching. Better than Pizza Hut, but for all the fuss and flash, you expect alot more."}
{"text":"We are the new owners of Redbrick Pizza in Gilbert and have raised the bar! Only the best ingredients, lean meats, fresh veggies that we pick by hand and fresh made salads daily. Come see us and see the difference ! I can assure you it is one of the BEST gourmet pizzas you will ever have. And we make you feel like one of the family! Live music on Friday nights on the patio! Good food, good fun! Try us out!"}
{"text":"After a movie at the Cinemark, our choices were limited for vegetarian options at the Mesa Riverview, so we decided to try Red Brick Pizza. It's definitely fast food, but they do bake the pizzas on terra cotta stone, at over 1000 degrees they say. It was hardly Cibo or Pizza a Metro, but better than other fast food pizzas like Pizza Hut or Papa Johns. It's a gas powered oven, not wood, so don't go expecting smoky goodness.   I had the 7\" Pizza Bianco with sausage, ricotta, mushrooms and pine nuts, and Hubby had the 4-cheese. He said mine was better than his. It was a tad greasy, but had decent flavor. We also had some cheesy bread sticks, which were hot and soft- pretty decent. With two self-serve drinks, dinner was about $18.   They also serve some sort of Italian sandwich/salad combo and gelato, neither of which we tried. The place was pretty busy when we arrived, and they have a variety of seating choices, with about half having a small flat-screen TV mounted right at your table. Red Brick is an acceptable option at the Riverview if you're hungry and not expecting much."}
{"text":"Red Brick Pizza, off Gilbert Rd., is a place my husband picks dinner up from on the way home from work about once a week.  We had a Red Brick Pizza back home, for a short amount of time, but about as quickly as they sprouted up, they disappeared. I blame that more on the recession, and the location they chose, than anything with the restaurant. For the duration of their brief stay, it was one of the places we frequented, so we were happy to try the Gilbert location shortly after we relocated. We've been back every week since. Maybe it reminds us of home, maybe we're just habitual eaters (I could definitely be called that), but for whatever the reason, its good food, reasonably priced, and the owners and employees are nice.   I am naturally a healthy eater 90% of the time. Many times, I just have their salads. They are fresh, I love that they come in 3 different sizes and, while I like several, the Greek is my favorite (go figure based on my Z's Greek review). I've also tried a few different dressings and like them all.   I'm not a big fan of thick crust pizza; I like to taste other toppings besides dough with my pizza. I also don't like \"NY style\" slices to where I have to soak the grease up off the cheese with a napkin before taking a bite.  I'm not really knocking these kinds of pizza pie, it certainly has its fans, but I'm from the South and it's just not what I grew up with. For what I look for in pizza, Red Brick has a perfect crust, the toppings are always fresh, taste great and they have a pretty large variety menu to choose from, or you can pick your own toppings.  If you are a family with kids, it's a great place to go due to the TV's at every table. We mostly choose to carry out due to it being just my husband and myself and we like a quiet atmosphere to reconnect after work. I hope this location sticks around longer than the one we had back home!"}
{"text":"Our first time here. Really friendly clean and good pizza. Recomend the BBQ chicken pizza and add bacon to it. Yummy"}
{"text":"Always friendly, always consistently good pizza. Compared to all the Red Bricks I have visited this is the most customer friendly."}
{"text":"We have been going to this Red Brick Pizza at Gilbert Rd and Loop 202 for years,  and through all of the owner changes, and love this place, especially with the latest owners. They are the nicest people.  We had dinner there tonight, and I was happy to see, it was quite busy!  Very happy to see that, as most decent places here in South Chandler, close their doors within their first year, so we actually dont have many good choices down here.  My favorite pizza is the Pizza Bianca, with sausage, its delish.. My husband loves the Red Brick Gourmet and the chopped Italian salad is to die for!  I read the other reviews of this place, and cant believe that they had bad pizza or that its worse than Domino's. I am very careful as to what I eat, and am sensitive to excessive salt, so if it were overly salty, I wouldnt be writing this.  Great food, nice family eatery, and great service.  No, its not a 'romantic' dinner type place, but if youre going out for that, you wouldnt be going for pizza anyway.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had a Groupon for this place because we had a trip planned for Phoenix and I thought it would be fun to try some new places besides the ones right around our hotel (we vacation in Phoenix every year).  The cashier told me my Groupon had already been redeemed earlier that day, but my App clearly showed that it hadn't been redeemed yet.  Not to mention I had just flown into Phoenix that afternoon so I couldn't have redeemed it yet.  They finally agreed to honor it, like they were doing me a big favor.  Then they didn't know what the offer even was because they said they had too many offers out at the time.  I had to look it up and tell them what was included in my deal.  When the salad came it didn't have chicken on it even though I had ordered a chicken caesar salad.  They argued a little about that as well but finally added the chicken.  The breadsticks came next and they were bland.  The pizza was decent, but certainly nothing I would come running back for considering all the problems leading up to getting it.  Which is too bad because my father-in-law (who lives in Phoenix, whom we were visiting) was looking for a good pizza place to make a regular destination.  This won't be it."}
{"text":"Yummy in the tummy was good has a new name and owners.  The only downside is during the week they close at 7pm  And this part puzzles me, if you show up after 630 they ask but its kind of telling you that you have to eat the pizza outside or take it home to eat."}
{"text":"The pizza didn't look that good.  The breadsticks were terrible.  The chopped salad was expensive and simple.  The drink selection stinks.  I hate when a place doesn't have fresh brewed iced tea.  That all said I will likely go back BECAUSE I noticed they have gluten free pizza and I will take my husband there to eat.  Also, it is a nice location and the kids can play outside in the grass after we eat."}
{"text":"We bought a groupon for this place and drove out to check it out on 01-07-2012. Such a disappointment to the least. I have never experienced worse customer service. The two girls working the counter were so incredibly rude. They appeared bothered to do their job. The bathrooms are filthy and the soap dispensers have no soap. I'm really curious about how the employees wash their hands with no soap in the dispensers. The food is decent, but not worth the hassle of the poor service. All in all, even if I had a coupon for free food, I would never return here."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying that I am a pizza snob. I'm a Chicago native and there are so many fabulous pizzerias to choose from. I've never had pizza in Arizona and decided to give them a try. I got a small Margarita pizza which was basically a snack. It wasn't gross or anything, it just didn't do it for me. They were a little skimpy on the fresh basil, sauce, and cheese."}
{"text":"Great pizza and Fhazinis! Staff and Owner are Friendly! a must go to on the Southside!"}
{"text":"Went in trying to get a quick, bite to eat, and seriously, I was contemplating asking for a refund. It was like eating cardboard w/imitation cheese. To top it off, it was expensive. Now I don't mind paying for food, as long as it's good, but this was ridiculous!   Don't go here, unless every single restaurant off Baseline Rd is in foreclosure, you're starving and will pass out if you don't eat something soon... you're better off going to the Fry's Supermarket next door and eating something from there."}
{"text":"I like the idea of gourmet pizza to go I think it's great because I love pizza. Walking into Red Brick Pizza I noticed they had tv's at almost every table and a few selection of beers so far so good. I already had a good impression of the place and was excited to place my order. I got a margherita pizza, a drink, a scoop on pistachio gelato, and an order of breadsticks for my friend. It didn't take long to get my pizza but they forgot the breadsticks and the guy making them asked if I wanted just oil on them? Uh no. Cheese please!  Who want's just oil on their breadsticks? Weird. I finished my gelato in the car on the way to work and it was pretty tasty but I don't think  you can mess up gelato. I was looking forward to having pizza for lunch but the pizza I got lacked flavor. Thank god I asked for a side of ranch because I needed that to eat the rest of  the pizza. I am not a picky eater by any means but  the pizza here sucks. A Totino's pizza would of tasted better then what I got from this place. The atmosphere is cool but the food is not."}
{"text":"As an Italian girl, I am insulted that this place is categorized \"Italian\".    When I plan a pizza night out, I do not like spending $25 for frozen pizza.  When did it become OK to call frozen pizza Gourmet?  Next time I'll do DiGiorno.  We had a large Hawaiian pizza and tried the Gelato.  NYPD and Streets of NY have tastier, fresh pizza.  I have to agree with Colin M.  \"And while they offer gelato, it's as disappointing as the pizza.\"  For an authentic, Italian gelato, don't mess around; go to Frost at the San Tan.  As far as the breadsticks go, they were hot; however, the marinara was stone cold.  If allowed, I would rate Red Brick 0 stars."}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent little pizza place.  The pizza is thin crust, brick oven style.  From what I understand it is a chain, though this is the only location I have ever seen.  In any case, they compare poorly to the heavy hitters in the area (Grimaldi's, etc) but pizza is one thing that is rarely ever truly bad.  I would have no problem coming back, but it is not at the top of my list."}
{"text":"We had a $25 Gift Certificate for Red Brick that we got off of the old Beth & Bill KEZ 99.9 FM website from their Half Off Deals Page. We also had a buy 1, get 1 free coupon from the Entertainment Book... They said that we could not use both. Either 1, or the other. We were furious!  A Gift Gertificate is just like cash. Period....It is not a Coupon, too. This made NO sense to us. Talk about a cheap Company! We ordered 2 pizzas... They both tasted bland, had like no flavor! Very disappointed. Z-Pizza is waaaay better by far!  We will never go to Red Brick again! I highly recommend Z-Pizza!  Also, there were like 4 Hispanics working behind the counter and they would all gabber in Mexican the whole time we were eating which we found to be rude, & not appropiate. Their prices seemed to be on the expensive side as well.  We used to go to the one on Camelback & 16th Street a long time ago, but that location closed. We only went to this location because we wanted to also go to some other stores in this area and use up the Gift Certificate we had."}
{"text":"For cheap and fast pizza this place is good. I go every once in a while to get a pizza. Seriously, its chain and it tastes like one. Go if you want some fast cheap pizza, don't expect Grimaldi's or anything."}
{"text":"Finally a pizza place in the SE valley that not only serves fantastic pizza, but GELATO! Personl faves include the chopped salad and Greek-style pizza. Red Brick Pizza also draws crowds for the TVs at each booth. Keep in mind this is a hot spot for local families, so if you're looking for a romantic date night it might not suit the bill."}
{"text":"OK, so this Gilbert Red Brick Pizza isn't that much different than the other Gilbert Red Brick Pizza. BUT, one thing different is, I never tried the gelato at the other one. Big mistake!  Red Brick Pizza's gelato is made in the store fresh every day. They rotate between 50 flavors, offering 12 at a time. I thought the pizza was a little shy on the sauce and the store wasn't as clean as the one I usually go to, but it's hard to complain when the gelato's this good!"}
{"text":"Took my kids there everything came out quick and we ate it all.  Kids wanna go back."}
{"text":"I decided to take the family to RedBrick Pizza since it was so close to Cinemark Theatres and BassPro Shop.  Besides, it convenient location to where I wanted to be, I decided to stroll in with my family.  The decor was nice, it was lively, with background music, and the ultimate, a TV at every booth. My wife and I knew this was the place, that we could actually carry on a conversation without the kids meddling in our conversation.  We walked over to the counter, looked at the menu and decided to order the Chopped Chinese Chicken Salad, a Large Order of Chesse Breadsticks, and a Large Pizza, half Pepperoni and half Vegetable Gourmet. The salad and breadsticks came first, in most places it comes all together...My kids ate most of the salad, however, we enjoyed every bit of it.  It was freshly tossed in an Oriental Dressing, only one word WOW! if the kids eat salad, please eat more.  The breadsticks were absolutely brilliant, hot, cheesy, and the right amount.   We waited just about two minutes after finishing those two items and magically came the pizza....It was phenomenal, thin crust, hot, and the right amount of ingredients.   Then after we finished, my little girl, decided to want to try some Gelato....(if you never had Gelato, go try it, it has less fat and CALORIES then regular Ice-Cream) it was a delight, mouthwatering, full of flavor in every bite....My recommendation WE ARE GOING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a margherita pizza and a small salad. They delivered the pizza with only  a few shreds of basil and completely forgot my salad. Plus my crust was burnt. Completely disappointed.  *we didn't complain, but when they brought us our salad,  they brought 2 cannolis on the house. That was nice."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago my boyfriend and I visited Redbrick pizza, and were quite surprised by the fast service and the great quality of the pizza.  The employees welcome with great smiles and warm personalities.  The pizza is delicious, and can only be understood at how delicious it really is by trying it for yourself.  The atmosphere is great for a date night or just a night out with the family.  I would recommend this place to everyone!!!!"}
{"text":"These guys have it all! I love their pizza the staff and the pizza! Cant give enough props to them!!! GBR!!!"}
{"text":"Last night I couldn't decide what I wanted to do for dinner.  I really struggled with what to eat last night.  Should I cook?  Pick something up? I really didnt know what I felt like, so I finally settled on pizza.  I went to Red Brick for 3 reasons.  First, it was close.  Second, I've never had it before, and thirdly, I didnt feel like driving to Barro's.   I cruise in here and I the decor was nice.   Clean, attractive, inviting.  Nice!  I reviewed the menu, and thought that it would just be easier to order simple.  I stuck with a small pepperoni pizza.  I was under the impression that this was going to be a thicker style pizza.   I was sadly wrong.  It was thin and honestly, didn't taste all that great.  It was kind of greasy to me, also.   I really wanted this pizza to be good.  I mean, it was okay, but it was less then what I had anticipated.  They also had gelato there, which I've never seen at a pizza joint before. Interesting.   I did order the mint gelato, which was tasty!  The gelato bumped it up a star.   If my review was based on pizza only, it would have been two stars. Decor, friendly staff and tasty gelato bumped it up a star.  I would probably return to this place, but not  becuase I think its oh so great.  Most likey to return becuase its right there."}
{"text":"Brick oven pizza is the BEST as far as I am concerned but this place doesn't quite deliver.  It's just not quite in the same quality category as my beloved Me-N-Ed's in Central Cali.  But it IS Brick oven pizza and it IS pretty good!!  Average price, fantastic friendly staff and gelato!! The BBQ chicken Pizza is a family favorite.  Maybe that's why I am not a huge fan.  I prefer the classic pepperoni and extra cheese (sometimes add pineapple and jalapeño) or a combo.  I am not too big on the BBQ mixin with my Pizza. Anyway... I digress.  This place is not to be avoided! Not sayin I am running here every time I crave pizza... but I never complain when the family requests it!"}
{"text":"find myself craving this on occasion, good food, great people - family owned !"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! They gave us free breadsticks while we waited less than 10 minutes for our pizzas. I got the vegetarian with red sauce and parmesan garlic crust. It was amazing! My family got pepperoni pizza and salad and they loved it!!! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent service!!  They remember you too.  The food is great and if it isn't they make it right.  I love it there, it' has a nice, family, neighborhood feel.  I hope these owners NEVER leave."}
{"text":"When a place bills itself as \"gourmet pizza,\" it sets a certain level of expectation. Some joints live up to them. Some don't.   Unfortunately Red Brick Pizza falls into the latter camp. And it does so while billing itself as the world's best gourmet pizza. It's fast food quality pizza at best, and doesn't even stumble enough into mediocrity to be on the level of Domino's, much less something like Papa John's (or even Pizza Hut). We're talking worse than Domino's here, folks. WORSE THAN DOMINO'S.  The crust was dense, tough, and flavorless, and if there was actually sauce on the pizza to begin with then I'm not sure where it went. The bigger toppings were less cooked than they were lukewarm, but the cheese was at least melted. It's also worth noting pies top out at an incredible fourteen inches, so if you're feeding a mass of people you'll be buying multiples at ~$16 a pop.  On the up side of things, Red Brick does offer some tasty and attractive salads, the employees are friendly, and the service is fast. Unfortunately that's hardly enough to offset the pizza (unless you're going veg). And while they offer gelato, it's as disappointing as the pizza."}
{"text":"For such a quick pizza joint and premade crusts we were in love with this place.  Guy behind the counter was very patient as we drooled over the menu possibilities and assisted us with our choices."}
{"text":"Always great pizza and service.  The owner is often present and always friendly.  It's especially nice to have a gluten-free option, and they are very good, too.  Don't miss this unassuming, inexpensive gem!  MK"}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite pizza places, I love thin crust. I was shocked today to see that this location was closed. I was just by a few days ago. Everything was still in the restaurant, just doors closed and a notice on the door that they were a victim of the economy. They were always busy, I don't understand."}
