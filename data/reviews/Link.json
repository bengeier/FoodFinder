{"text":"I came here to get an overpriced breakfast. They serve Starbucks coffee. I had an egg sandwich and it was average and expensive.
I would only recommend coming here if you are staying in the Sheraton and are in a rush in the morning."}
{"text":"This place is super convenient if you're staying at the Sheraton. I went here twice during my stay. The first time I got a bagel with cream cheese & OJ ($7). I liked it and they give you a generous amount of fluffy cream cheese. The second time I got a bagel sandwich which had cheese, turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, and mustard ($6). It was a pretty good sandwich and the portion was generous as well. On both visits, the ladies who helped me were super friendly and the food took minutes to make."}
{"text":"This is convenient stop on the way out. Pleasant employees. I love their egg and mushroom wrap! They have almond milk options for coffee items."}
{"text":"Convenient for guests staying at the Sheraton or attending meetings. Coffee and muffin for me today. Accepts green vouches from hotel which makes it an attractive money saving option."}
