{"text":"We come for brunch on weekends. Their staff are always very friendly, the food portion is amazing! What i love the most is the sausages - a bit sweet on the outside. Definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Not good.. Came here for summerlicious and the food was nothing to write home about. The lentil coconut soup didn't taste anything like coconut and the seafood fettucine had small scallops and only 2 overcooked shrimp. The waitress seemed rush to get our orders and barely said a few words to us, it felt like as if we were paying to be an inconvenience to them. The place was hot and stuffy...overall not impressed."}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious for lunch. It's a cute little restaurant with  a casual and relaxing vibe. The food is also quite good and I was pleasantly surprised :)

It is quite small though, I was literally right next to the lady beside me and it does get quite clumsy to try to get in or our of your seat, especially during the winter time with your big coat and everything. Still recommended though!"}
{"text":"Nice, quaint little spot for a brunch - its like being in someones country home. Food was good and is fresh and vibrant. The only thing letting it down was the service - the lady was definitely grumpy to be up so early."}
{"text":"Delightful date night with a great friend.    Immediately felt welcome and settled in.   Two male staff were kind, attentive and very aware of their environment.    
Drinks and food were timed perfectly felt attended to but un rushed
Must return again soon (please excuse grammatical errors)"}
{"text":"I quite like this place. I find the menu though, a little overwhelming in terms of sizes and the portions are a little ginormous for me.  But I guess it's in true French Bistro style that a salad equals a mountain of romaine lettuce with a whole lot of heavy stuff on top of it. Light is not the order of the day here, though on my last visit I had some delicious mussels which fit the bill quite well. One of my favorites on baldwin."}
{"text":"For the price, great quality of food. Service can be slow, but I think that's just European of them. The servers are really nice, so I don't mind the slowness; this ain't no McDonald's.
Portions are huge, and they use fresh ingredients. I love how their salad has a very very light dressing, and they didn't douse everything in it. Home fries are chewy on the outside and fluffy on the inside, and bits of fried green and red peppers come with it. All their food items are done very well, in my opinion. They do not overseason and nothing was too salty, which I appreciated. They have a cute patio, and nice tables by the window. Each table has fresh flowers. 
The place is filled with paintings, and their music is enjoyable.
Overall, a comfortable place for a hearty, filling brunch. Nothing fancy, but quite homely and cozy, and in a quiet and great location. I have found my favourite brunch place. Their menu is quite extensive (their online menu is outdated).
Only thing that is stopping me from giving 5 stars is the fact that they left out a portion something in our dish, even though the exact portion was clearly stated on the menu...For example, they say they'll give you 3 of something on the menu, but only give you two on your plate...I thought I was crazy, but reading another review on here, I see that this is something they do once in a while. I don't think they're doing it on purpose, because they do have a large menu with very similar dishes."}
{"text":"For $25 you get a three course meal, including a salad, a main, and a desert. The duck salad I had was spectacular, as was the crembrule for desert. The main (I had lamb), while good was nothing special, but combined with everything else, that didn't matter. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This restaurant is completely underwhelming.  I went with a friend and order Mediterranean \"pizza\" for a $15 lunch.  The food was horrible.  We made ourselves pick off some of the toppings because we were hungry.  The small salad that accompanied it was fresh and good.  The waitress was rude and completely disinterested in our satisfaction, or lack thereof.  The man at the table next to us asked for a tea and she informed him that there was no hot water!!! 
We will never go back.  On leaving we deterred a couple from going in and sent them down the street to another spot."}
{"text":"This place has a nice patio and the interior feels cozy. The waitress smiled a lot."}
{"text":"I have been religiously coming here for brunch and it is by far the best in the neighborhood. The selection is great and the classic sausage and eggs, steak and eggs, and eggs benny are delish! They come with salad and fruits and amazing toast (except for eggs benny). 

I've been here for lunch and dinner a few times and they were pretty good as well. I highly recommend their fish in the daily special. 

The place has a homely feel and paintings on the wall are intriguingly refreshing. 

One of my favourite recommendations in the city!"}
{"text":"One of the go to places on baldwin and always reliable. Good food and service.

It's been here forever and probably always will be.
If you're lucky, you'll get one of the few tables on the front patio (much nicer than the one on the back patio)."}
{"text":"Came by with a colleague during lunch time. It just so happens that Summerlicious is on: $15 dollar for Appetizer, Main Course and Desert. I started with soup, had a porn shank for main course and ended with a Lemon Cheese cake. My colleague had Beef Carpaccio, Risotto and Creme Brûlée. Both the appetizer and main courses are nicely done but the deserts felt like they were store bought. The overall dining experience was above average and for the price; we couldn't be happier. 

We'll definitely give it another try of their regular menu in the future."}
{"text":"I find that just about any place on Baldwin has decent food, and Cafe La Gaffe certainly exceeded my expectations.  Atmosphere is nice and cozy with an open kitchen concept, which makes it was a great first date choice if you get a table by the kitchen.  Although the temperature can be a little towards the warmer side it didn't bother us because we went during the winter.  Not so sure if you go during the summer although.  Service was prompt, polite and timely.  The restaurant is a bit small, so if you do take someone, make a reservation to avoid a mood killing table wait!

We went with the Calamari app which was great.  Not the deep fried crunchy run of the mill stuff, pan seared served on a bed of greens.  Very refreshing and tasty.  For mains we went with the braised lamb shank special and it was excellent.  Meat wasn't strong at all, but the sauce it was served with seemed a little mismatched, can't remember what it was but it was too sweet, even for lamb.  The risotto was cooked perfectly and tasted great.  But nothing really jumped out of the dish.  The meal was finished off with a creme brulee recipe claiming to be from the 1800's? Was still good nevertheless.  They a have a superb wine selection as well.  Not sure how knowledgeable the staff are since we knew what wine we wanted."}
{"text":"3.5/5! This place has a pretty ordinary menu, but the food and service is great. I recommend the filet mignon sandwich and the Gorgonzola pizza. Enjoy :)"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant probably around a dozen times in the past few years. I've always enjoyed the food and service, and went back a few weeks ago for dinner with a friend. 

I ordered a steak cooked medium rare. Instead what I received was medium well. After first cutting into it I noticed it was way overcooked. However, I decided to try it and began eating. About halfway in the server came around and I politely told him the steak was too well cooked for what I had requested. He immediately affirmed that the steak would be redone. He then went to the back (the kitchen is clearly visible to diners) and I heard the chef yelling about my request. He came back with the same plate and told me the chef was absolutely sure the meat was cooked as I requested. I'm not stupid, and I've eaten many steaks in my lifetime, and I knew for sure that a medium rare steak shouldn't be grey on the inside middle. After going back and forth and hearing a bunch of visible agitation from the chef, he finally decided to cook me a new steak, but this didn't come until I agreed to \"definitely eat the new one because they didn't want to waste food\". I guess it makes sense but if it were me I would have just redone it without making a customer verbally promise to eat it. 

I was really dissatisfied with the experience for a number of reasons. Firstly, the server quite frankly treated me like I was dumb, and going back and forth with the same plate after promising first that the order would be redone was pretty unprofessional and embarrassing. Hearing the chef yell about a customer complaint didn't make things any better. When the server returned with the new steak, he made sure to remind me that \"actually the first steak was cooked even rarer than medium rare\" which was definitely untrue and unnecessary to say. If they really disagreed so much they should have told me off the bat that they don't do redos instead of being so wishy washy and invalidating of my opinion. 

I really loved this restaurant but unfortunately I will not be returning due to the perplexing and bizarre service experience."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group of friends (12 of us) for the Summerlicious dinner menu for the first time. I had a curry lentil soup to start, seafood pasta for the main, and crème brûlée for dessert. I couldn't order any of the starters with the soft cheeses so I settled for the soup. It was surprisingly good! The pasta was great and the portion was pretty big. The dessert was good, but the top was slightly more burnt than I expected so it was rough to chew and got stuck in my teeth.

Overall, we all loved the food and the atmosphere. We were seated on the back patio and got to enjoy the perfect weather. The staff were super friendly and cheerful. We will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Location location. One of the cutest café-style restaurants in town, looking out onto tree-lined restaurant row on Baldwin St. Great brunch options at fair prices. Dinners are a little expensive relative to the quality but the atmosphere is worth the premium. Staff are courteous and professional. Sit under the tree canopy in summer and watch the world go by."}
{"text":"Went for lunch....worst lunch I've had in years. The soup was bland and missing the spicy sour cream that would have added some flavour and the pizza was worse. The pizza seemed like it was made on a precooked dough and did not resemble at all the ingredients listed in the menu. They could do so much better with very little effort."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch! More than expectation! The only drawback is the ugly font on menu!"}
{"text":"4 star for the brunch. 

This is my regular place for weekend brunch. I usually order the steak and egg or the banana french toast. Their steak and egg comes with 4 ounces  filet mignon, two eggs, freshly baked toast, salad, and fruits. The banana french toast is a sweet opening for the day. I haven't found a better place in Toronto that offers the same degree of ambience and food quality.

The lunch/dinner is not as unique. You can find lots similar options nearby."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious with a large group. We got seated on the patio on a beautiful day, so points for that. The service overall was pretty good, they refilled our waters pretty often on a hot day so points for that too, that is where all the positives end.

The food was pretty bad here. I started off with beef carpaccio, the beef served was bit off colored and \"seared\" on the outside which made it a grey and pale pink piece of meat served. I was not impressed. 

I had ordered the steak sandwich and had specifically asked nicely if it could be medium rare or medium, since I HATE well done steak. I got a beyond well done steak sandwich for my entree. The mushrooms were also making the bread soggy and it was pretty greasy. I would have complained but I was with a big group of coworkers and my boss and did not want to spoil the celebratory mood by complaining about my food. It was hard to eat this. 

For dessert I got the cheesecake, and it was a gritty over-sweetened mess. The cake is definitely overbaked and has a terrible gritty texture. It was also super sweet, I ate one tablespoon and could eat anymore.

I get that summerlicious is pretty cheap, $15 for 3 courses, but I have been to other places for summerlicious and winterlicious and they have been great (eg Bodega right down the road). If you are going to participate shouldn't this be an opportunity to gain customers and not lose them? Anyways, 2 stars for patio and constant water refills, -5 for food."}
{"text":"Unfriendly service. Plain and the mediocre food. Nice seats on the outside, tough."}
{"text":"This place is a little hit and miss. The first time I went for brunch - it was a slamdunk hit. Service was prompt and friendly, and our plates were overflowing with sumptuous eggs benny, crisp garden salad and freshly roasted potatoes.

The second time, unfortunately, was a bit more of a miss. The poor waitress who was left to serve the entire restaurant - packed even on a weekday with hip families, morning-afters, and classy ladies (oh yeah, that was us) - was running around the entire time. But undoubtedly, one gal can only do so much. The odd thing was forgotten and we had to regularly ask for refills on water and coffee. Things were a little slow in the kitchen as well, as we waited just long enough to notice that we were, well, waiting just long enough. Luckily, the atmosphere of the place and the company were charming enough to keep our 'tudes at bay. 

The food is good, and something that I love about La Gaffe is that their whopping sides of salad are a welcome alternative to more greasy goodness. Eggs are done just right, and their fancy sausages definitely hit the spot. I would see myself coming back here to give 'em another shot, but a word to the manager - please be sure you have more staff on hand when it comes to morning brunch times!"}
{"text":"There is not many Sunday brunch restaurants open on Baldwin. So we blindly just picked one with more people inside and it was Cafe la Gaffe. It was not a lot of tables but it was packed, so we got a seat at the back by the kitchen. It was entertaining to see how they work in the kitchen, they were pretty quick and busy.

I ended the Eggs Benedict with peameal bacon with home fries and salad. Even though there was a lot of orders, the chefs were quick in getting us the food. It was good plate eggs benedict but nothing really special and stand out. Good place to get some breakfast to start off the day."}
{"text":"I do not recommend this gaffe of a restaurant. 

Service was poor. We had a group reservation early and restaurant was not that busy. We were told as we sat down that we wouldn't be able to split the bills and there would be an automatic 18% tip because this would apparently be too much of a hassle with a busy restaurant to handle individual transactions. 

As it came time to pay, the 12 of us were left sorting out the bill and how to split it as they still allowed multiple transactions. This took an extraordinary amount of time as the waiter left our table between each payment. I see absolutely no reason why they couldn't have split the bill especially when applying a generous 18% tip for mediocre at best service. Maybe if they took some of the money from their inflated tips and invested in a new credit/debit machine payment system this whole headache could be avoided. 

Food was okay. Pizza was overcooked. Appetizer portions were small. Beer selection was very limited. 

Bottom line is there are far better choices for a place to eat in Baldwin Village. Will be sure to go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"This place used to be one of my old favourite places in the city. John Baby was a restauranteur i respected, but that was 15 years ago. I was in here a few weeks ago for brunch and wow, it's changed. There are still some great things about the place including the fresh food, and the quantity of the food, but the service and general precision has really dropped off. I was there one morning a few weeks ago and experienced surly service, drinks mis-prepared, and no attention to any detail. I couldn't really speak too badly about the food, but I'm just feeling like no one cares about this place. It could use a change of ownership and some love to bring it back to the place it used to be."}
{"text":"This place is cute as hell. I took my parents here while they were visiting the country and they loved it. Insanely affordable for a big luxurious meal. Seafood was great and the wine was good too. The place is decorated with spooky/creepy awesome art. Next time I'll sit outside under the canopy of the trees. Has a very European/Montreal feel."}
{"text":"I love this spot for brunch. Big portions, delicious food, cute and cozy decor. Both times I've been here, it's been quiet which I love. I love sitting out back, it's got a little mid of a Moroccan flair. The last time I was there there wasn't music playing outback - so that was a little awkward in terms of silence but I don't care because the food is so good."}
{"text":"Visited Cafe La Gaffe for Winterlicious with a group of 6 friends as it was nearby. The Winterlicious menu was pretty varied and had many different meat options. 

I had ordered the smoked salmon salad, seafood pasta option and creme brulee. No dish was particularly bad - or good, nothing had really stood out or was particularly unique; although the salmon portion of the salad in particularly was very underwhelming. It was all very okay and slightly disappointing.

It's a quaint restaurant with home-y decor, the service was pretty good as the server was attentive to filling our glasses with water when we ran low. The lunch price for Winterlicious was $28 which I felt was a bit high for what was a very generic meal. 

If you're in the area, it could be an option if none of the other numerous restaurants on Baldwin St. offer what you're after. However, it definitely would not be my first choice - maybe the regular menu is better?"}
{"text":"The food was ok but we aren't too sure it's French cuisine. We came with a buytopia coupon but might not come otherwise."}
{"text":"We went for lunch as a group of 6 for Winterlicious 2018. They have their bigger tables on the patio, so we were seated there. It was a snowy day, and the heated patio's roof is a layer of \"water resistant\" fabric in winter. What happened was, because of the heat, the snow on the roof started to melt... and gravity let it slowly drip on us. By the end of our meal, it was raining on us so bad that I had to put on my jacket. We asked the waiter to move but he said they only have their big tables on the patio.
Also, forgot to mention that we were greeted by a \"Just to let you know, we do not split bills for tables of 6, and charge 18% gratuity\". 

Lesson 1: Do not sit on the heated patio on a rainy/snowy day.

As for the food, their menu for winterlicous is quite extensive. I ordered a carrot ginger soup for appetizer, their mushroom risotto (which was vegeterian) for main, and their \"rum infused\" banana chocolate cake.
Soup was pretty good, I have had better but I am a big fan of ginger in soup so I liked it. The portion for soup was relatively large. Some people at our table ordered the smoked salmon which came with salad, they liked it a lot.
The main: Risotto. SO SALTY. I realized it might be because of 3 things: 1) it was covered with Parmesan cheese which is salty, 2) the sun-dried tomatoes in it were basically chunks of salt and they used a lot of those, 3) they added regular amount of salt even though #1 and #2 were enough to make you drink 10 gallons of water for the rest of the day.
The risotto was very flavorful and rich; if it was not for the salt I would have given it a 5/5.
Other people at our table ordered the duck, which they said was really good. No talk about it being salty, so I think my theory was right.
Dessert: Rum infused banana chocolate cake. But where were the rum and banana flavors? It tasted like those instant cake mixes you buy from loblaws for $2 and make a whole cake yourself at home. The slice was super tiny, but it came with a strawberry which was the best part of my dessert.

Lesson 2: Food could be extremely salty (avoid anything that has sun dried tomatoes in it. They like to use it A LOT)

The decor of the place looks really nice, especially on the first floor. If you reserve a table in advance, try to get one of the ones beside the windows at the entrance. The view is beautiful on a snowy day.

Since the patio was very quiet (it was us and 1 other table), the waiter ended up splitting our bill (which saved us from a huge hassle). Service was not that great though, very slow. The waiter took way too long to get our orders and disappeared for a long period of time. One of us had to get up to pick up the water pitcher and fill all of our water glasses.

Lesson 3: Service could be slow depending on who your waiter is.

Overall: 2/5 stars. Because of it constantly raining on us, the slow service, and because of drinking so much water after the salty food, I have to deduct 3 stars."}

{"text":"I will definitely be going back to this wonderful Cafe. Had a fabulous lunch there this week. I had the duck lunch special... It was perfection! Creme brulet was fabulous! I will be back!"}
{"text":"i visited the cafe for brunch on a sunday.

meal ordered: their regular coffee, and bacon and egg \"sandwich\" which actually was not a sandwich but like a bacon and egg omelet made from a mashed up sandwich, it also had a slice of honeydew, pineapple, one strawberry. the plate also had potatoes on it and i munched it down with ketchup. 

food: rating of 5: an absolutely delicious lunch, potatoes had good seasoning and were fried very nicely, the omelet had tons of flavour, fruit wash fresh. even the coffee was surprisingly fresh and delicious.

service; rating of 3: a little slow, and somewhat cold, but nothing that could be considered terrible, but it just wasn't good enough for a \"5\" rating.

portion size: rating of 5 very good portion size, there was a lot of bacon, 3 eggs (i think?), the coffee was not that big, but breakfast was perfect sized.

price: rating of 4 his was reasonable the \"sandwich\" was around 12$ and coffee was around 2$ .. all in reasonable..

ambiance:  rating is 4 I usually don't add this section in reviews because I usually pay attention to food (as all of you should :) ) but this place had tons of unique art pieces, and the place was very interesting overall, not to mention the somewhat interesting baldwin village.

overall: great place for brunch, I can't say that it is as good as the leslieville places that I have been to, but for baldwin village it is actually quite nice.... good food, good price, nice environment and just a good little place to to brunch"}
{"text":"Café La Gaffe has been a legendary spot to catch up and drink wine with your best friends and continues to hold its own in this category. Called la Gaffe by locals, I see the category that stands out is for breakfast and brunch, but it is an excellent spot in the evening too. The lack of a crowded dining room on a Saturday night may be a result of that reputation, but don't let a quiet evening spot like this deter you from going in because the food and wine, along with the service and atmosphere were spot on. It's so relaxing to drink wine while taking in the artwork there, a perfect combination of an interesting wine list, along with art that is painted directly on the walls going around the corner of the nook by the front door as this is something I could never tire of looking at. The Bouillabaisse I had was beautiful too. Tasty nuggets of seafood in a deep and rich broth was superb! What a way to compliment the wine that evening. And Baldwin Street at night is enchanting with it's narrowness reminiscent of the horse and buggy day."}
{"text":"I was looking to go to Vegetarian Haven but they didnt open til 5pm so I walked a few doors down and saw Cafe La Gaffe.  It was 4pm on a Thursday.  I asked to sit outside and eat.  It was nice they have 4 tables in front.  I had the Med. Pizza.  It was real nice.  The pizza was great, the crust was Excellent, the toppings very nice.  Too much for just one person.  In between the pizza slices on the plate is a very nice salad.  I had water with lemon.  The prices were nice too.  $15 plus tax.  I put the picture up of the pizza.  The street is nice and quiet enough to sit out and eat.  It looked like a nice bar inside.  The waitress was attentive."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years, I first discovered this place back when they were located in the heart of Kensington market with my friend Rick the owner of Boots Bar. Now that goes back a ways. I loved it then and I love it now. Very remarkable that they have been around all these years. They must be doing something right."}
{"text":"It was 8pm on Sunday night and my friend and I were debating where to go to dinner...he suggested Baldwin St. and I immediately thought of Cafe la Gaffe. Final decision.

We had been to Cafe La Gaffe about a year ago and were expecting a high level of service and memorable food- we got just that.

To preface, Cafe La Gaffe's decor is somewhat \"Parisian\" inspired with a grand wooden bar (selling point- they have coat hooks under the bar...in my books, this is well thought out and adds the extra touch, even though I did not sit at the bar I did notice them) lining one wall and a row of pews and tables lining the opposite side. There are also two tables directly in front of the windows, one on each side of the door, which we were lucky enough to snag amidst this semi-busy late dinner crowd. The kitchen is in raised area directly at the back and viewable from the rest of the restaurant. 

Another big plus, the soundtrack playing at this restaurant was incredible...both for a romantic date and also for friends catching up over a beer, as were the group of 4 girls sitting at one of the tables lining the side wall. Think Amelie soundtrack, Nick Drake, Patrick Watson...I kept wishing I could whip out my iPhone and shazam every single one of the great \"dinner party\" songs...I refrained, mostly.

Cafe la Gaffee has an extensive wine list and also \"feature wines\" listed on a chalk board hanging above the bar. As the \"feature wines\" were about double the price as the wines listed on the menu, we opted for a Pinot Blanc from the menu. We had some questions for the server about the wine list and he was kind enough to come back to the table with the bottle to give us more information on our selection (i.e. I've read the back and realize that this may be a bit fruity for your taste...can I recommend something else?\"...Great service if you ask me. We also never felt rushed to order which was great as we had a lot of catching up to do first. We went with a Pinot Gris. Delicious.

As for food, my dinner date ordered the Mushroom Crepe as an appetizer and I ordered the $5.50 Garlic Bread au Gratin (with cheese). Although I was in the mood for bread (judge all you want, it's cold and the carb cravings have hit full force), I did not consider that I was ordering bread on top of the free warm fresh bread served with hummous. I'd hold off on the garlic bread next time, although it was extremely fresh and had the perfect amt. of cheese. My dinner date loved his crepe...it was stuffed with garlic and mushrooms and smothered in a mushroom sauce. It was also served with a roasted tomato...amazing. Great value too at about $10. When I go back I will order this, it was delish. 

Entrees (approx. $22 each) consisted of Fettucini with Digby Scallops, PEI mussels, Gulf Shrimp, roasted red pepper, spinach and portobello mushrooms in a white wine lobster sauce served as a very generous portion with a side salad. ORDER THIS. My dinner date ordered the Bouillabaisse with PEI mussels, clams, Digby Scallops, shrimp and served with couscous. As soon as our meal arrived we barely spoke to each other. We were so enamoured with how frickin' amazing the food was. mmmm. 

As if the food couldn't get any better, and we couldn't eat another bite, we had to try the flourless chocolate banana cake with creme anglaise so we finished off with the most delectable dessert I may have ever eaten. I would go back just for this dessert. Actually, I probably will because I can't stop thinking of it. 

Service was stellar...which from the other reviews leads me to believe that may be because it's too cold for a patio, but nonetheless our server was very attentive and he was also funny, just sayin'. 

Moral of story: I will return. Great spot for an actual date if you want to impress your date with amazing food and a charming atmosphere. Also, they don't rush you here so you can spend hours \"canoodling\"...or ignoring each other while falling in love with your food."}
{"text":"Oh wow, I'm very disappointed. I actually just came back from France four days ago and this restaurant is really not like a French restaurant. Not just the decor, but the menu too. On Yelp it says French, on Google it says Mediterranean. This restaurant is actually French AND Mediterranean. My experiences with restaurants on Baldwin are usually good, but this wasn't that great. (I probably should have checked out Bodega instead.)

I came here for brunch on a Sunday around 11:50. There were barley any patrons at the time and there were TWO waitresses working. One of the waitresses was talking so loudly to the other waitress that I heard every bit of her personal life. Something about dating a guy younger than her??? Maybe keep it down a bit? (This was all in the span of me ordering a drink and getting my drink). 

I got the Eggs Benedict Florentine. The portions was pretty good. You get salad, fruit, and home fries, but the taste was not that good. Both of my friend's poached eggs were overcooked and so was one of mine. Nothing worse than cutting into a poached egg and not have the yolk run all over the place!  I didn't think the muffins were that fresh - they were incredibly hard to cut into and eat. I didn't think my potatoes were cooked through either. They were very hard. My friend's home fries, for some reasons, were really spicy even though we both got Egg Benedicts. Overall, I thought the dish was poorly executed. 

I think the Non-Loud waitress was new or something. She poured us water and a good splash of it onto my friend's plate! WHAT. It's okay, she made one small mistake, but good thing we were done with our food at the time. I mean, he didn't notice, but yeah.... At one time, I also heard the Loud Waitress control and tell the Spilled Water Waitress what to do and not do. I dislike seeing this kind of behavior in a restaurant and in front of patrons because it just reminds me of Kitchen Nightmare. 

I don't think I would recommend this restaurant. There are so many better places to go to where the food tastes good and the waitresses aren't talking about their personal dating life. (I only save the terrible service and food for a 1-star rating). 

THEY ALSO ADD THE TIP ON TOP OF YOUR BILL. It was 18% I think. 

Wow. 

TLDR; Just weird, the place was strange. The decor was strange, the waitresses were kind of unprofessional, and the food wasn't anything great. At least the portions are big."}
{"text":"Cafe la gaffe is such a gem in Baldwin village. It's decor is very quaint and homey and fits in perfectly with the vibe the whole area has going for it. The colour of paint on the ally's in bright and welcoming. As well as the painting on the walls and colour of table clothes are very interesting and bright. The best part is the summer and winter licious menues which give you a great bang for your buck with a set price for a three course meal. With that said, my fave I always remember from their menue is the tuna steak and steak-yum! I for it medium rare and the flavour was unbelievably good!!!!!!! So scrumptious and juicy it's mouth watering. The potatoes were a awesome side dish with a lovely flavour .They have a nice selection of wine paired win it made it a delightful meal! Perfect for an intimate evening with friends or an SO."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Cafe La Gaffe after eating at most of the lovely places on Baldwin (vege haven being my fave). My dad and I ate here for our monthly meet up meal. 

I had the caprese salad and creme brulle and my dad had the salmon. My salad was ok, there was lots of boconccini cheese, roasted red peppers and tomatos, however I found the dressing to be very oiley and there to be a lack of balsamic. My dad however really enjoyed his salmon entree. The creme brulle was amazing and perfectly done... bottom super creamy and the shell was perfectly golden crispy caramelized sugar... the text book creme brulle.

The service was excellent, our server was friendly attentive and I actually hadn't had service like this in a restaurant in a really long time. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I came back to Cafe La Gaffe in the wintertime and had their pizza. Delicious, fresh toppings and crisp crust made by a stone oven."}
{"text":"I've been here for both dinner and brunch and would recommend both. The atmosphere is cozy, service is good, food was tasty. I had the florentine benedict at brunch. Funny thing happened. The sugar container was full of salt so that first mouthful of coffee was pretty awful. We thought we were being punked. Told our waiter, who understandably freaked a little, then they ran around removing all of the sugar containers from the tables to be checked.  No big deal, but it did make us laugh."}
{"text":"5 reasons to go here:
1) yummy (had eggs benny - hollandaise was lemony)
2) on Baldwin, one of the most charming streets in the city
3) the coffee refills! Do you ever get annoyed when you're at breakfast and you have to literally stare down the server with dagger eyes to get a refill?Our server came to our table, I exaggerate not, 10 times to refill our coffees. I had to put my hand over my mug at the end to keep her from refilling. It was heaven. I haven't had a caffeine buzz like that in a while. The kind where you can feel it behind your eyelids. 
4) the tablecloths. So unique. 
5) decently priced. Bill came to $16 for eggs benny and coffee (10 cups of coffee though)"}
{"text":"I really enjoy Baldwin Village.  It reminds me a bit of my childhood as I had several friends and family actually live there.  Some of those houses are now trendy shops and restaurants, but I can remember a time actually being in them when people lived there.  Yes I'm THAT old.

But there's always character and charm in a street that seems to have a bit of history, narrow, tree lined and packed. It reminds me a bit of St. Marks in New York, although less busy.

Cafe La Gaffe is fittingly one of those charming places.  We came for the Summerlicious lunch, to which I've basically stopped going places with a summerlicious prix fixe (another discussion for another time).  This time around, the service was toot quick.  Beef Carpaccio, Grilled Salmon, and a Creme Brulee to boot were all decent, but nothing spectacularly memorable.  My only complaint was that the Brulee was obviously rushed.

The other bit of disappointment was my friend's scallop pasta only had one lonely little scallop in it.

So, even though it was probably a three star experience, the place manages to charm me into giving it one added star."}
{"text":"A group of us headed here this past week for a little birthday brunch. 

While the food was not short on taste, it was also not incredibly standout. I had Eggs Natasha (benny with smoked salmon hash) which was nice. The hollandaise would have been better with some taste to it...it was incredibly flat. The meal still worked though. I will say that all of our meals were really nicely prepared and not one person had a complaint! 

Everyone enjoyed their freshly squeezed mamosas (7.95 each) and I was wishing I would have tried their fresh grapefruit mamosa! Next time!

Similarly to Susan G., we had some awkward confusion when we tried to split the bills. Next time we will mention it at the start (agreed Susan, it is always annoying to have to remember this!) but now we know. 

I would recommend La Gaffe overall! The birthday boy especially enjoyed the banana french toast and the banana chocolate cake (this is really amazing..and huge!!)"}
{"text":"tl;dr: This is a dope place. Café La Gaffe is the Batman who saves Gotham (aka Toronto and its string of crappy brunch places).

The events that lead to the discovery and my subsequent falling love with Café La Gaffe are analogous to the famous Greek epic of homecoming story \"The Odyssey\".

\"The Odyssey\" tells the epic story of Odysseus, who after fighting in the battle of Troy, must make his way back to Ithaca, where he is the king and ruler. Odysseus' journey is difficult and laden with obstacles. Meanwhile, his wife, Penelope patiently waits. After a while, people begin to think that Odysseus has died, and suitors start lining up, hoping to win over Penelope's heart and (more importantly) the seat to Ithaca's throne and unlimited access to Odysseus' money. But Penelope KNOWS her husband is still out there and rejects all the suitors. Odysseus' trek home becomes a ten-year voyage filled with hardships and death, but he FINALLY makes it. Penelope realizes her hubby is back, big O slays all them fuckboi suitors, and they live happily ever after.

In this metaphor, I am Penelope, Café La Gaffe is Odysseus, and all the crappy brunch Toronto places (trust me, I've been to a TON) are the suitors. It's a Greek epic filled with hardships that lasts ten years (or in my case, two years). It took me a long time to find a GOOD brunch place but, like Penelope, I never lost hope because at the back of my mind, I knew that my Odysseus was out there.

Anyway, I came here for brunch and I'm convinced that Café La Gaffe doesn't hire chefs -  they hire artists. I don't really think about death and I'm not sure what happens when you die, but I've got a strong hunch that Leonardo Da Vinci's soul has reincarnated into the body of whoever is responsible for baking Café La Gaffe's breakfast potatoes. Because those potatoes aren't just regular potatoes, they're oily soft delicious piece(s) of art that deserve a whole wing in the Louvres museum. Also, adding caramelized onions AND caramelized red bell peppers to the potatoes? Iconic, innovative, groundbreaking. Give the potato maker their Nobel prize.

And don't even get me started on the salad. Who was in charge of coming up with that perfect blend greens and sweet-but-not-too-sweet dressing? Was it someone with a chemistry PhD, or a wizard with top-notch potions skills? 

And you know what else is great? The aesthetic. Eating perfect eggs benedict and sipping on my cute café au lait while Feist croons about the love of her life in the background? Magical, surreal, out-of-this-world. Lately, I feel that a lot of places will put all their energy in the overall vibe, at the expense of the quality of the food. Luckily, Café La Gaffe goes hard on everything, and every aspect ends up being top-notch.

Look, this was a long list of accolades with an even longer backstory, but I feel like it was necessary to fully encapsulate the big picture. I've spent way too long in the dark over Toronto brunch, settling for below-average places. No more."}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times for brunch and have enjoyed it every time. 

Staff is super friendly and attentive. Cute place on a cute little block. 

If you're into it, eggs benedict is the go to dish here. Omelettes are good here as well. 

Had sausage and eggs today which was nice but there are better things on the menu. Really enjoy that breakfast dishes come with salad along with potatoes. 

Will be back here yet again I'm sure"}
{"text":"Took a lot of deciding between 3 and 4. Food was very nice. Particularly the chèvre salad. The 'Conard confit' pizza was also delicious. The base a little crunchy and overdone, but the flavours were amazing. The wine list is well done. Checks the list of the prominent new and old world regions around the world, and different varietals. A couple of wines I'd prefer a different region, but they'd done pretty well. They were served slightly too warm, but I'm happy when you can get a good Rioja and not just cheap California stuff so not too fussed. It's a little pricey considering the decor. Seems more matched to a fun little Mexican place, not somewhere you'd order a $30+ lamb shank."}
{"text":"We landed here on a Saturday afternoon, drawn in by their fantastic brunch specials menu. There was a variety of exotic and tasty-sounding omelettes, and one of them in particular caught my fancy: mushroom, caramelized leeks and Emmental cheese. Yum! It was absolutely loaded with yummy goodness, and came served with potatoes and a salad featuring fresh fruit as well. Washed down with delicious fresh-squeezed lemonade, it was nearly perfect. But in such a quantity I couldn't even finish it. My partner had a grilled salmon sandwich which looked equally fantastic, and he was pretty satisfied. The atmosphere was also lovely, with a few tables out front. We were offered seats at a patio out back, but upon trekking through the kitchen and down some dark corridor, found ourselves in what resembled a park picnic party set-up, with plastic coverings and tents and not much sun. We opted for indoors, which was plenty cute and cosy."}
{"text":"summerlicious 2016

Came here on the first day of 2016 Summerlicious. I'm impressed as always!

our party had beef carpaccio, greek salad, caparese - all are fantastic. I really enjoyed my lamb with mash. Seafood pasta and the tilapia also got great reviews. In the end I finished my dinner with a nice creme brule - ramekin-lickin good. 

one thing to note, they don't do regular menu while summerlicious is going on. in case you don't want to do prix-fix menu you can visit here outside of this time period. 

everything was fresh, delicious and flavorful. I really liked the back patio - it was like a little piece of heaven back there on a nice summer evening. 

well done cafe la gaffe."}
{"text":"Came today for Winterlicious lunch with my research team and was so pleasantly surprised by the Winterlicious menu (many options) and unique, homey atmosphere! The ambiance is very cozy (cute tablecloth!) and intimate and so take advantage of the indoor patio out back! It was a bit cold though sitting there today, but it is supposed to be heated. 

Advice: make a reservation if you're coming as a large group because it's popular here and seats do fill up.

Food 3.5/5. Well presented, generously portioned (even for Winterlicious) comfort foods. Think French cuisine, but Italian portion sizes. Aw yes. I ordered the vegetarian pumpkin soup to start, the vegetarian (not vegan- it has cheese and probably butter) risotto as my main, and chocolate cake to finish. The soup was 3/5 - it was warm and adequately viscous (I hate watery soups), but was very bland. I almost reached for the salt shaker, but instead just stuck with adding some pepper because trying to watch my sodium intake lately. The risotto was also bland, but quite an indulgence 3.5/5. Not the best risotto I've ever had as it was also quite bland, and even though it was sticky as it should it wasn't exactly creamy if that makes sense. I wonder if they used olive oil instead of butter. The portion size was large, some of us couldn't finish. The chocolate cake was dense and contained bananas and nuts 3/5. It was between a brownie and a banana bread, interesting but perhaps too dry and bread-like for folks who might enjoy more moisture. All the food were nicely presented and I appreciate how the Winterlicious menu actually had way more than just 3 entree options!

Lost one star for a lack of vegan options. Basically don't come here if you are strictly vegan :(

Will be back for the atmosphere and to try the seafood pasta next time!"}
{"text":"Food (2/5)
The food was sub par. I started with the red lentil soup which was probably the best part but nothing spectacular. For my main I had the seafood pasta which was something I could have made better myself. The noodles were from a packet, the scallops were tiny (about the size of my fingernail) and there were literally only 2 shrimp and they tasted like they had been in the freezer for too long. The creme brule was okay but it was cold.

Service/Atmosphere (1/5)
We booked this place for an office Winterlicous lunch (aprox 15 people) and since we didn't have alot of time, we had asked if we could preorder so the food would be prepared but Victor assured us that  everything would be quick. This was not the case. The food came out slowly, and often times one group would be done their course before another group had even started. Water was not refilled and no one came to check on how we were doing. We were at on the patio which had been closed up for the winter but it was raining and a few people were constantly getting dripped on. 

They also did the \"bait and switch\", something I had heard of before for winterlicous/summerlicous but never experience. Upon arrival, the entire winterlicous menu had changed from what was posted. On the original menu they advertised things like tiger shrimp in the rissotto or salmon fillet, but when we arrived we were offered pink shrimp or tilapia. To top it all off, we were charged 20% auto-gratuity ontop of tax which we were all unhappy about."}
{"text":"The brunch was great. I ordered the avacado sandwich and it was full of so much flavour. The serving size is large and filling. I would definitely recommending checking this cafe out for a nice weekend brunch."}
{"text":"After spending a morning participating in the fabulously fun Mystery Art Sale at the OCAD, my husband and I thought we hit up Cafe La Gaffe for brunch. It's a cute little bistro tucked on Baldwin Street, and we were craving the brunch food they serve.

The woman who greeted us was very nice and friendly and gave us a choice of seats, took our coats, and gave us menus. She came back soon with glasses of water. A very positive start! Unfortunately, that was the best it got at Caffe La Gaffe.

There were only a couple of other tables, not too bad. We smiled when our server came over, so I don't think we did anything to set her off. The word my husband used to describe her was surly. Apt description. 
She came over to the table and said \"do you know what you want?\" while scowling. She only half turned toward us while taking our orders, and when I passed her my menus, she looked me up and down and never looked at my face! I couldn't believe the rudeness. And it never improved from there.

I really would have given them a break if the food was better. Unfortunately, I had to pick the seeds out of my mimosa. I appreciate fresh squeezed o.j., but use a strainer for God's sakes. My first sip was chock full of seeds. As I didn't have a spoon or a side plate, I proceeded to pick the seeds out with a fork and pile them on the table. Final count? 14 seeds. Disgusting.

My eggs benedict were not much better. The first bite had an overpowering taste that did not belong. After picking it apart and analyzing each element, I realized the peameal bacon was sickeningly sweet, and the hollandaise sauce was way too lemony. The egg and english muffin were fine, but I barely ate it. The salad was delicious, however, and so were the homefries, and the toast that came with my husbands eggs, so I was able to make a meal of it.

There is absolutely no good reason to go to Cafe la Gaffe. The service was bad and the food was either really good or inedible. In a city with as many restaurants as Toronto, there is never a need to go to a bad one."}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhoods in the city, Baldwin Village.
In this tucked away bloc surrounded by houses along this stretch of road is Cafe La Gaffe.  A French inspired place with some cute, urban decor that's serving some classic Francais dishes!
Competing with other French restaurants such as a Bodega 

Starter was escargot with a butter herbed sauce served with crostinis. Beautifully presented and definitely my favorite.

Mains: Duck confit with an orange glaze served with potatoes and vegetables. Succulent and full of flavors!

Dessert was a Belgian chocolate cake was okay didn't WOW me, but overall a great meal."}
{"text":"Our time at La Gaffe will always be remembered as our most spontaneous, pleasant, and romantic eating experience in Toronto.  We had just finished touring the nearby Ontario Legislative Building during Doors Open, and were looking for a late-morning bite.  By simply \"walking around\" we eventually landed on Baldwin Street, where we found this little French gem.

At first we wanted to sit outside, but since the front terrace had no open tables, we were seated by the main entrance, off to the left of the bar.  This spot seemed to give us more privacy plus a nice window view of the terrace, which actually made the experience more intimate.  Our server was friendly and very generous.  Upon his recommendation, we started with a carafe of chilled Trius (local riesling) while sharing a tasty bowl of Mussels Marius.  My entree, the Omelette du Jour, was something I'd never tried before: eggs packed with chopped salmon, diced onions and peppers, and emmentaler cheese.  It was served over a bed of seasoned baked potatoes, alonside a fresh house salad, sliced melons and kiwi.  My wife had the Eggs Benedict, which came with the same sides.  

For as many varieties of egg dishes we've had since, we have yet to find many as good as these.  Everything was pure bliss, especially my omelette.  Very happy with the bill too.  An overall great and unforgettable morning in a vibrant and diverse city.  Looking forward to the day we can return."}
{"text":"I had much higher expectations for Cafe La Gaffe for my lunch meal. But I guess according to other posts, they excel in brunch so I'll have to come here again. 

Coming in the last bit of the lunch rush, the restaurant was quite empty, but it gives you a chance to see the full restaurant. It's actually quite adorable, a little place that looks slightly bigger than you expect it to be looking from the outside. 

I ordered the special chicken and veggies, and my friend ordered an omelet with mushrooms and tomatoes with a side salad. 
The chicken and veggies were.. Kind of normal? It was something you would get at a dining hall. The omelet on the other hand was actually really, REALLY good. Totally should of came for brunch. The side salad was a bit plain, just lettuce and sauce. But that omelet. 

I also ordered a caeser. i recommend listening to everyone else and getting wine. It is a French restaurant so who am I to order a Canadian drink? 

3 stars for the food (would of been 2 without the omelet), but our server makes it 4 stars. She was attentive, always making sure our glasses are full, and started up a friendly conversation too. 

I will definitely come again for brunch and I'll stick to wine next time."}
{"text":"I decided to let bygones be bygones - by which I mean my friends really wanted to try it - so I came back.

I remain convinced that they are more interested in making money than providing a pleasant dining experience.  

There are lots of much nicer alternatives on Baldwin.  Don't waste your time on a place whose principle draw is their reputation from the last decade."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Café La Gaffe. Originally we were there for its risotto. It turned out that Café La Gaffe only serves brunch during weekend. We ordered the standard brunch on the menu - something that you would expect from anywhere else in Toronto. It actually tastes very good!!! (and great portion). It is above the level and I personally think that it is even better than Insomnia and Aunties & Uncles."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious. What a disaster this place is!
I highly recommend you cancel your Winterlicious reservations. Read on...

Just like with Summerlicious, they do bait and switch: they put interesting items on the menu (pesto pasta, salmon, tiger shrimp, etc), but when you actually come there the items are not on the menu. Instead of tiger shrimp you get cheap regular one, and they replaced the fancy salmon dish with a half-ass boiled tilapia. 

I got:
* soup: some generic lentil soup you can get at most shawarma places for $2. It is a good soup, but there is nothing special about it. 
* tilapia with veggies: plain boiled cheap tasteless fish with boiled carrots, a broccoli, and a piece of beets. Just plain boiled stuff, as if it was cooked by a kid, not by a french chef. There was some sauce drizzled around the rim of the plate as an after-thought, to provide at least a little bit of flavour.
* \"Bittersweet Belgian Chocolate Cake Baked with Dark Rum\" (quote from the menu). Tasted like some stale dry generic cake from Metro. no detectable rum in it whatsoever.

To add insult to this, they add mandatory tips for groups of N or bigger. Probably cause it is harder to serve a table of 5 as opposed to 5 tables of 1 patron?

We wanted to try this place cause it is not far from the office, and the menu looked decent.
Needless to say, we will never come back.

It looks like a \"take your money and run\" type of establishment. Perhaps they are riding their reputation now?"}
{"text":"Great service, good food and reasonable prices. The lamb shank was excellent. I would recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"A great place for lunch between classes.  Service is prompt and the food is delicious.  Everyone around our table loved what they ordered and alot of food envy happened.  Friend swears by the charred salmon sandwich, which looked great and everyone seemed to like.  I had the seafood pasta which was amazing, perfectly creamy and delicious.  Great portions and reasonable price.  Would definitely go back again and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"After so many years working close to Baldwin Village (and now a student near Baldwin Village), I FINALLY got to go to Cafe la Gaffe with my coworkers.  There was a large group of us - approximately 20.  Surprisingly, there's an outdoor patio in the back where it could fit a large amount of people.  It's really cute.

There was quite a diverse selection of food - ranging from sandwiches, salads, and pasta.  I, myself, had ordered myself the avocado sandwich - containing scallions, lime, garlic, cilantro, brie -- and a market salad on the side.  DEFINITE recommend.  I looked at my other coworker's lunches, and I found mine to look the most delicious (next to the filet mignon sandwich).

My only problem with the restaurant was that it took forever to get our bill.  We had about 20 something people, and for some strange reason, they decided that it would be better if they put it on ONE bill.

Otherwise, great place to go to."}
{"text":"Summerlicious Lunch 2016 - $18

The first thing that drew me to selecting this restaurant was the Summerlicious menu according to http://www.toronto.com/guides/summerlicious/articles/cafe-la-gaffe-summerlicious-menu/ and still showing incorrectly on their own website http://www.cafelagaffe.com/menus/summerlicious-lunch/  I've corrected the menu below to reflect the changes (to what I can remember) so that other customers won't be disappointed when they arrive.

The  restaurant's interior was cozy, but the furnitures seemed worn out and the chair seats outside the patio were ripped. Maybe it was to create a bazaar atmosphere? Who knows? Liked the table cloths though.

It was their \"Yellow Fin Tuna.\" in the Summerlicious menu that brought me here in the first place. However, much to our disappointment we found out it was changed to \"Tilapia.\" (a detritus/bottom feeder) instead. When we asked the waiter whether there was some sort of mistake, he just said there has been a \"slight change.\" 

Being pescetarian and having knowledge of the prices at fish markets, that is around ~$8 to $15 depending on the weight. Basically from a high-quality fish to a waste-eating fish is NOT a \"slight change\" at all. But since changes were subject to the restaurant's discretion, we stayed as it would seem rude, so we gave it a chance...

Let's talk about the food. The ginger and carrot soup was delicious and possibly the tastiest thing on the lunch menu. Now, it was a good thing that we were able to change the Chicken risotto back to the Seafood risotto on an ex-gratia basis. The sauce was tasty, but the risotto was overcooked and was super mushy instead of having an al dente texture. The black tiger shrimps were also overcooked-- we only received 2 pieces; that's what you get for asking for a substitution. Also, it was not even black tiger shrimp. Didn't taste the pork chop, but my friend told me only the sauce was good; the chop was pretty bland.

Being optimistic, thought dessert would redeem the bad experience? Nope! The sugar on the crème brûlée was not completely caramelized properly, nor did the canned peach & icecream spark any joy. 

Really wanted to like this place, but the Tuna to Tilapia was just inexcusable. The only done right was the service; the waiter was attentive and nice. 

Guess you get what you pay for. Don't think we will return again. Hoping they would update their menu though."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, this place seemed really busy all the time so to be on the safe side , I made lunch reservations on a Friday afternoon for 5 people. When I got there, I still saw a few empty tables so it couldn't be as busy as what the hostess told me over the phone.. 

What attracted me here was the fact that this restaurant was classified as a breakfast and brunch place but unfortunately, brunch is only served on weekends so we were a little disappointed. I got the risotto and it was pretty good and the portion was huge! I barely finished half of it and had to pack the rest.

They also seemed a bit understaffed as there was 1 waitress managing our entire section so service was really slow.. Took us 30 mins to get our food. Still the waitress was doing the best that she could and was still super nice. The backyard patio was nice too so I recommend you sit there when the weather is warmer :)"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for a lunch with a friends or family. Has very fast service and an outstanding chef"}
{"text":"Adorable decor, friendly staff
Great for large groups. No line on a Sunday!  Serves brunch until 4pm 
Banana French toast was awesome, would recommend an option of whip cream on the side.
Croquet Madame had perfect poached eggs, the bread was a little rough to chew.
Had a great time!"}
{"text":"This place was  underwhelming, but it might have been because of the Winterlicious promotion happening. 

I started with the pate started (pate and lettuce with a glob of dressing - this was super poorly done), had the lamb shank (this was okay, it had strong hints of cinnamon, which I didn't love, but didn't hate, the mashed potatoes were good and the roasted veggies were seasonal), the cheesecake was good, but I wish there had been more (and it tasted like something you could get from the bakery section at a grocery store). My friends got the salad (just no) and the escargot (she seemed to enjoy them), and the steaks (which they said were okay) and the cheesecake too).

We were also seated right by the door, so it was super cold and the waiter kept reaching across our table to adjust the lights. We had to wait a long time to pay and kept having to ask for water refills. 

I wanted to like this place because the ambiance is super cute, but it was just so blah, especially considering the prices. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious dinner. Was a set menu for 28$.

Apps
 salad 4/5 - very refreshing dressing, just the right amount and a kick to it, walnuts added a great texture
Escargot 5/5 -definitely one of the better escargot had, very good texture and flavor highly recommend

Main 
Duck 3/5 - mediocre. Cooked well and very tender but the sauce was a bit sweet for me personally
Lamb 3/5 - cooked very well and comes right off the bone, the marrow was very good, but personally the meat was not seasoned strong enough and was a bit bland.

Dessert
Gateau creole 3.5/5 mediocre chocolate cake, moist with a subtle hint of rum, but nothing spectacular, can probably find at grocery stores
Creme brulee 3/5 - very good flavors,  only complaint is it was a bit cold

Drink 
House red 2/5 do not recommend even though very cheap,it was almost lukewarm and did not even taste fresh. was a cabernet merlot blend but did not have the flavors at all, not impressed for a french restaurant.

Service
5/5 very friendly staff, very quick to prepare and serve the food, no complaints

Overall 3.5 nice and small french restaurant on Baldwin, good experience but nothing  amazing enough to try again for repeat visits. But recommend for those who havnt and looking for an affordable, tasty french cuisine,especially their winterlicious set menu if they offer again, just for the value, $28 for 3 courses."}
{"text":"Very good French cafe on cute Baldwin street. They have brunch all day on weekends. Good food, fair prices and great location. Cute atmosphere to boot. I had the grilled chicken sandwich that comes with a side salad, and my husband had the fish sandwich. Both tasty!"}
{"text":"small store front and eclectic decor. food is on the pricier side but once you see the portion you won't be disappointed. I got the duck pizza which was huge but a little on the salty side. from what my friends ordered, pasta and stuffed chicken seemed like good options to go for. overall not amazing but definitely a pleasant experience"}
{"text":"I was in need of some long overdue girls' time this weekend so brunch was scheduled and the next thing I knew my ass was planted in a lovely, little, seat on the patio of Cafe Le Gaffe on the adorable Baldwin St.  

Now my friends and I are ladies of particular taste -- we like our talk, loud, our language, dirty, and our food, well, the way we like it.  So Lord help the lady who has to take our order.

On this specific morning, the Lord seemed to have forgotten about our waitress and everything that could have gone wrong on our order did.  Omelets were yellow that should have been white, potatoes were given instead of salad, orders were switched but the biggest mistake of all:

SHE FORGOT THE CHEESE!

uh-uh honey that's when ma' bitches get angry!!!

Alright enough of that.  In all honesty I think it was the server's first day and she must have committed a variety of sins the night before to be stuck with our horror of a table.  When all the mistakes were cleared the food was actually quite delicious and I would return but I don't want the waitress to suffer flashbacks from the Post-traumatic stress she no doubt was given by our table."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times as I used to go to UT for undergrad and worked at UHN but unfortunately my experience as been getting worse and worse. I had the duck pizza last and everything was just too dry and blande. The prices have also been going up. It's too bad as I used to like coming here for casual dates, but I won't be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"I wrote a review prior to this and it was deleted.  I assume they didn't like what I had to say and reported it.  However here I am again :) 
My first experience was so horrible with service I actually wrote to the manager.  He did reply the first time and 'apologized' offering me to come back and he would mail me a voucher.  When I replied my email was blocked.  Quite comical.

The second time I gave La Gaffe a shot was during Winterlicious.  My dad and I were the only ones in the restaurant at the time and then a big group came in.  We were wrapping up and I had asked for the bill.  Instead of grabbing our bill and take care of us, our server continued to ignore us and served the table of 14 people.  Let's just saw I was not impressed.

On a side note to represent my coworkers, a group of them had gone for a lunch date.
We work in one of the hospitals on University row.  When they came back from lunch (the majority of them ordered a mixed tuna salad), one by one they were dropping like flies going home sick.  

There are many other restaurants on the Baldwin street that take pride in their quality of food and service.  Sadly I gave this place too many chances."}
{"text":"I think 3.5 maybe? But 4 stars says that I'm a fan, and I suppose I am.

My little sister was visiting for the weekend and we fancied brunch in the 'hood. Seems like a few places in the vicinity don't want to put on their happy morning faces until 11am or 11.30am so Cafe la Gaffe won partly based on being open. The menu was the most enticing thing, however. It's pretty extensive with something for most tastes-a mix of breakfast, brunch and lunch foods.

Our welcome was warm and we were placed at the window table which is a tiny 2-seater. It was a little tight but adorable. We basked in the winter sun and tried to figure out what to eat. The menu is large to begin with but they also add specials and it was really difficult to choose. In the end, I went with a chorizo omelette served with salad and home fries and she went with the sausage breakfast.

My meal wasn't piping hot but was very tasty and came with fresh fruit on the side. So filling! I felt envious of my sister's sausage breakfast, however. The sausages were delicious and it also came with some very tasty toast that I just had to sample. For Yelp, of course. I think I'll get that the next time. Or maybe the french toast. Too much choice!

Service was excellent. I felt sorry for the server, unfortunately. She was so sweet but she was trying to run the place all by herself. It was too much. She was very attentive despite this-I think I had around 10 cups of coffee because she refilled my cup every time I got about half way down. She never lost her smile and pleasant demeanour regardless of  the number of tables either.

Overall we had an extremely satisfying and very relaxing brunch. It's not bad value either at $10-$14 per plate. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant with a wonderful and relaxed atmosphere. I had the Soup du jour, which happened to be Potato Leek. It was just what the doctor ordered for a blustery cold winter day here in the city. The waiter was attentive, and the soup was delicious!  The menu is extensive. This place is very relaxing, and ideal if you want to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"I love love LOVE this place! My coworkers and I visit Cafe La Gaffe a lot since it's so close to our offices, and it never disappoints. My go-to is the risotto (on the specials menu), followed closely by their pizzas and salads. The portions are HUGE and very worth it, and the flavor is always spot-on. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice place to go for weekend brunch. They have a good variety of choices for different tastes and cravings and I've always enjoyed my meals there. 

This time we had eggs benny with smoked salmon and farmers sausage breakfast. Both meals come with a good portion of salad with a nice light vinaigrette dressing (perfect for brunch not too heavy). Also well done Home fries with peppers onions and a slight kick. And some fruit slices to finish. 

The smoked salmon was not the usual slices but what looked like shredded and maybe fried? bits of salmon. Threw me off at first as I didn't expect that but taste and texture were good. Eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise was nicely done. 

Sausages in other dish were nice, three big links and a sweet/salty taste. 

Coffee (Americano) was very good but a bit small. The kind of cup you get at hotel banquets and luncheons if you know what I mean. After many Grande Americanos this cup felt like I was getting coffee in a shot glass. 

Service was good but resto wasn't super busy even for a Sunday afternoon. 

Decor is charmingly rustic (we sat on the back patio where you can get some breeze sun, shade and occasional leaves and other green bits falling from overhead trees. Note that the patio is not perfect -- chairs are old and worn, table cloths have had better days, the floor is uneven near the tree (um yes there is an actual tree) which makes the table rock ALOT. Despite those things the patio is actually very nice (and way better than most Toronto patios where you get a side order of car exhaust with every meal) if you want to eat al fresco but they have tables inside too if you prefer. We were there in summer but from what I recall they have heaters for cooler weather. 

If you are ok with a few imperfections the food is good the portions are big and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich is incredible, back patio is beautiful in summer, great staff , try the homemade lemonade!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a brunch date and it was a good choice.  We got a seat on the patio and ordered two dishes that were way too big for us.  Nothing really special, but good standard brunch foods.  I had the fresh grapefruit juice which tasted fine but they put ice in it...which is just wrong and forced me to drink it quickly before the ice melted.  It's a bit on the steep end of the pricing scale...over $15 per person and that's just a brunch menu item and juice each.  Not outrageous for the ambiance and location, but keep that in mind if you're planning on coming here.  And they don't accept bank cards."}
{"text":"I also had higher expectations of Café La Gaffe. 
I've been here twice for lunch (with coworkers in 2013/2014 ) and once for brunch (today). 

Service:
- we arrived on Mother's Day (Sunday) around 11 AM & it was not busy so we got seated right away 
- they were understanding when we moved from the front patio to indoor before our food was served and let us have our pick of tables 
- came to offer a coffee refill 
- accommodating of providing a side plate for ease of sharing dishes upon request 

Ambience:
- simple, quaint 
- does not feel Parisian 
- pretty view from Windows of tree lined quiet street (Baldwin) 
- for brunch it's nice when the sun streams in through the windows 
- relaxing vibe if not too full; staff are not overly intrusive 
- main floor female washroom has very dim lighting which is less than ideal for make up touch ups 

Food:
- banana pancakes (3 slices cut in half) with a berry compote and a slice of honeydew melon; cantaloupe; pineapple. With maple syrup on the side (no idea if it was Canadian syrup etc) 
- friend has the avocado stuffed omelette with home fries and salad 
- both dishes were good and nice to share a sweet & savory 

I would recommend to a friend if they were in the neighborhood but not if they were coming downtown from suburbs. I would go again if someone else chose it/ planned it but if the choice was left to me I would pick somewhere new to try. 

As for when I came with coworkers in the past, lunch menu was good and for $20 you got an appetizer, main and a dessert. But service can be slow for large groups so order fast if you're on a time constraint. Can accommodate up to 10-12 people at one table. Food was again decent but nothing spectacular from what I recall but was walking distance from work so a good spot."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant with my girlfriend mid week to celebrate her birthday. After a days excursion to the AGO, we found that Café La Gaffe was relatively close and has received rather good reviews. That bring said, it would be a great way to close off an evening.

I much like the atmosphere in this restaurant. It's small and cozy, and the staff was very friendly. I didn't feel any pretentiousness in the air as I had for some reason expected.

The food was delicious, but still somewhat disappointing. Particularly, the salad included with the meal was limp and boring, looking as though it had just come out of a pre mixed bag from the grocery store. I know, it's just salad, but sometimes it's the little things that count.

Just after we were seated, I privately asked our server to bring a slice of chocolate cake as desert at the end of the meal, just as a small \"surprise\" for my girlfriend's birthday. After we had finished our mains, we waited about fifteen minutes - during which time I thought the desert was being prepared - until our server came to the table with our bill. Somewhat disappointing to say the least.

All in all, a decent place to eat, and delicious food, but a little overpriced in my opinion."}
{"text":"I'm hoping that my poor experience was a one-off. My boyfriend and I decided on this place based on the numerous good (and great) reviews. However, things did not go as expected.  

First impressions were pretty good - it is a cute spot in Baldwin village. It's cozy, unique atmosphere reminded me of some of the restaurants I've been in overseas, and I enjoyed this about it. The staff were also very nice, very willing to be of service, though unorganized it seemed. My boyfriends appetizer was wrong, and his steak was cooked to rare when he'd requested medium. 

We each had the Sangrita, which was nice. The appetizers and mains were quite underwhelming, especially after what I'd read. I had the duck, which what little meat was on the bone was mostly too hard to chew. The sauce was a citrus, but far too sweet and unsuited to the side dishes, in my opinion. My boyfriends steak was mostly uneaten - there seemed an imbalance in the marinade used. 

Cute little spot, and the staff was friendly and seemed keen on providing a good service. However, our experience was unfortunately not what we'd hoped for."}
{"text":"Came here for a winterlicious prefix menu. The prefix menu was priced at $18/three course meal. The choices of appetizer were a soup, salad and a pate. My boyfriend and I chose a soup for him and a salad for me. The soup was tasty (lentil soup) and the salad was a goat cheese salad. The main options were plentiful as I decided on the pork and my boyfriend went for the pasta. Both dishes were tasty and portioned perfectly. The atmosphere was nice and cozy where the service was average. Not bad but not exceptional good. Overall, a place worth visiting."}
{"text":"Size: Went here for summerlicious and sat at the patio. The size of the place is appropriate for the size of a café (i don't think a huge crew would fit there lol). It is very quaint and can be suitable for 2 or 3 friends to hang out, or even a nice evening between couples.

Quality: for my meal I started out with the soup, then had the risotto with chicken, and ended with the crème brule. The soup was warm and delicious, the risotto was spicy with a lot of chunks of chicken, and the crème brulee was a satisfying finish. To add a little more regarding the risotto, when I said spicy it wasn't meant as a con but rather it provided a different taste altogether. It was my first time trying risotto spicy and for me it was a surprise but still I enjoyed it. Portion wise, I'm pretty sure I got the bang for my buck (if not a lil more) for this meal. 

Service: Our servers were friendly, accommodating, and the food didn't take too long to make. Our waitress was informational with regards to the menu and it helped with my choices.

Would I go back/recommend it: Yes. Even if it is not summer or winterlicious, the pictures on yelp look very enticing and after eating the food there I wouldn't mind dropping by from time to time and trying something new."}
{"text":"We came by around 4pm so the full menu was not available. We tried two of the veggie pizzas and they were great (with the exception of the ingredients falling off which was annoying). We ordered bruschetta which came out much smaller than I expected and the pizzas were more pricey than I would have liked. Not accessible for wheelchairs or strollers.
This place is popular and I can see why but I find it too pricey to make it worth going back with all the other options in the area."}
{"text":"Everything at Cafe La Gaffe looked great. The brightly painted walls were adorned with assorted pieces of curious art, all of the tables including the patio section out front were filled with chatty guests, the small open kitchen in the back was churning out over-flowing plates of vibrant brunch fare, and there was even genuine sunlight filtering through the storefront window to boot. 

The only intangible problem (if you didn't notice the constant head turning and the increasingly impatient waving of nearby guests) was in the service. It took an extremely long time for our orders to be taken while we hungrily watched surrounding tables get served. The lone server frantically trying to keep up with all of the orders would repeatedly ask the same questions and was running around so hectically, that I felt bad when I needed to ask for ketchup.

The food was quite good. I chose one of the handful of omelets-de-jour that featured cremini mushrooms and polished off every last morsel on my plate including the incredibly ungreasy home fries and tantalizing side of greens. The extra page of brunch specials really added a lot of tempting options to the mix. There surely would be no shortage of dishes to come back to try next time. I hope that they hire more servers soon, but they better be nimble cause the tables are squeezed in tight!"}
{"text":"I came to Cafe La Gaffe for a work dinner on a Monday evening, with a group of six. While I wouldn't classify this as a \"french restaurant\" as they do, it was still a good (*cough* ITALIAN) meal, at a reasonable price, with good service. 

We did make reservations for dinner, but realistically at 5:30 on a Monday, we could have had the entire restaurant. That being said, by the time we left (7:45 - 8) it was definitely filling up - mostly with couples or small groups of friends, which this place has the perfect atmosphere for. 

For dinner, I had the special pizza of the day off of their monstrous menu (I just stopped looking when I found something good, otherwise I would have looked forever!) which was sun dried tomato, caramelized onion, and smoked duck. I have to admit I had pretty high expectations for this pizza, and while it was a bit salty, it fit the bill. I had also ordered the lobster cakes for an appetizer, but ALAS they were out! I'm not sure how it's possible that they were out at 5:30pm, but they were. For dessert, I indulged in the New York style cheesecake, which was delicious but nothing special. Also important to note, the dessert portions are HUGE and should definitely be split! 

My colleagues all enjoyed their meals as well, except for one who had ordered the escargot appetizer, which was far too garlicy, to the point that she had to send it back. Even people on the other side of the table could tell how intense it was - you could smell garlic everywhere. So if you're not a huge garlic fan, perhaps avoid it. 

The service was really great - our waitress was quite helpful, and even recognized one person as she had been their the previous week. The server gave us plenty of suggestions, and was very attentive - at least until the restaurant really started to fill up, at which point she seemed stretched a little thin.

My only big negative about this place was their inability to split the bill - they did eventually, but only after complaining a bit that we hadn't told her prior to ordering. They also couldn't split items, which  I find so annoying! 

Overall though, this place is decent. But I'm not about to become a regular."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe with yummy food - will come again.

Came here today with friends for a late lunchette. I was VERY apprehensive about eating here when we arrived to find out that they didn't have air conditioning. It was boiling hot outside today and the only patio seating they had that could seat our party was in direct sun. Thankfully, the breeze sort of picked up and the trees came to our rescue as the sun shifted. Overall the atmosphere turned out to be very nice!

I ordered the Mussels Marius and was pleased with my meal. At $11.50 the dish had a healthy heap of mussels in a broth that was just the right amount of garlic and tang. I asked if there was bread that I could order to go with my meal and was pleasantly surprised to get a few slices of their house cornbread free of charge. 

Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying their entres!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch--CLG offers lunch-ier brunch items alongside standard bennies and breakfast dishes.  

I ordered a pizza, which was solid with the exception of the crust being so charred on the bottom that the knife that was served with it was frustratingly inadequate.  If I were in a hurry, it would have been far more annoying.  Beef got the blackened salmon sandwich, which was a delicious option I'd steer towards on a sophomore visit.

The atmosphere is charming, with a quiet, shady backyard patio.  The service was friendly and at a relaxed pace.  

I get the general sense that this is a dependable go-to on Baldwin."}
{"text":"Had a chance to come here for lunch a few months back. Overall great atmosphere although the patio is a little tight - my 4 star versus 5 star is probably based on the space of the place as opposed to the food quality. 

I ordered a Mediterranean pizza I believe and it was absolutely outstanding. I was really impressed and actually would like to go back again soon which is often the case with most restaurants. Great little summer spot."}
{"text":"Tried this place using a Buytopia coupon. I would strongly suggest you PRINT your coupon as they do not accept anything else ..aka cellphone. 

Service was poor but the food was good. I didn't have high expectations due to the service but was pleasantly surprised. 

3 stars max. A maybe recommendation. Just be prepared for the poor service if using Buytopia coupon/voucher."}
{"text":"Absolutely great place! Very nice and helpful staff, clean bathroom, small  garden and patio in a back. Prices are not exaggerated, food is very delicious and plates are really big. Worth a visit while a walk!"}
{"text":"This is my review on Cafe La Barf....I mean La Gaffe. Perhaps it was a mistakes to invite my family for a meal together on the first day of Summerlicious 2016. The restaurant was packed. It was oppressively humid at our dining area. Everyone at the table was extremely disappointed at our meal. 

We were very hopeful at the beginning of our meal, especially after the delicious beef carpaccio with shaved cheese and capers; however, the meal took a sharp turn after the appetizer.

The original grilled filet of yellow fin tuna entree was swapped with tilapia. It was a disaster. The Tilapia with mango, red peppers, lime & cilantro mojo, served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes & seasonal vegetables was luke warm. The fish was cold with many bones. The dish sounded great on paper, it was, however, a lackluster execution. 

My family also did not enjoy their entrees - marinated grilled chicken breast with an orange, honey & dijon glaze, served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes & seasonal vegetables and fettuccine with tiger shrimp, leeks, roasted red pepper & baby spinach in an herbed white wine tomato broth. The dishes were dried, overcooked and uninspiring. 

To add insult onto injury, dessert was the worst part of the meal. The poached pear was replaced with peach with vanilla ice cream & chocolate sauce. The peach tasted like canned peaches. The creme brulee lacked the contrasting layer of hard caramel. The cheesecake tasted like it was from a box. 

Goodbye Café La Gaffe! Will we ever meet again? \"Eek! Methinks not.\" - Yelp"}
{"text":"I came here a few times for their brunch when I lived nearby. The portion was big and food quality was great too. I recommend their fresh orange juise:)"}
{"text":"Customer service would seem to be the hamartia of Café la Gaffe. Me and my DC wandered in around 7:30pm for dinner. Their front patio was full, but I learned they have a Smoke Free Back Patio which are probably four of my favourite words in the english language. 

We were led to the back (pointed, really) along is a route that takes you through the narrow restaurant, past the kitchen, through a ramshackle corridor and finally on to the secluded garden patio. They actually manage to cram in quite a few tables considering the modest size of the space. The partial roof means plenty of shade and they have a gas heater for colder nights. It's a lovely spot.

A few moments after sitting down, our server politely asked us to move from our table (which was at the end of a row of two tops pushed together) to a separate table for two since they often get busy during dinner. This is an understandable position, but if they are particular about this they could have seated us properly, instead of waving us toward the back of the restaurant.

Anyway, we were famished so we got set to order. There was a full page of specials as well as a road-map sized menu. There were a lot of compelling selections. I chose the penne with beef, sausage served in rose sauce, and a starter of mussels in a Thai-inspired curry broth after I saw a girl furiously devouring these on the way in.

The portion sizes are generous and this is not helped by the fact that  our meals were really, freaking, good. The mussels' broth was brimming with awesome flavours, and I couldn't help sopping it all up with bread. It would have made a killer soup all on its own. The penne was just loaded with delicious stuff: spicy sausage, mushrooms, and slices of tender steak. My bowl of pasta was enough for two servings and I ate pretty much the entire thing. 

Foodwise, I had no complaints but getting served was another story. They are dangerously understaffed, or at least, disorganized. Our server was managing both the front patio and the back patio (and no doubt getting flagged down in between), which made her visits painfully infrequent. It took more almost half an hour after we finished eating to procure our cheque. I noted by the receipt that it had been printed ages before we finally got it, but clearly she hadn't had a chance to bring it our way. We waited another 25 minutes with the credit card sitting on the table before I hunted her down myself. When she conceded that \"she hadn't been back there in a while\" like the back patio was a college bar or the neighbourhood she grew up in, I realised that this type of thing probably happens a lot. I think they need another server on during suppertime, or at least divide up the dining room sensibly. Imagine working the extreme ends of a restaurant!

I can come here knowing I can rely on their excellent kitchen, but only if I have copious amounts of time to burn. Perhaps off-hours is when they really shine.

Obligatory Title Pun: Their only GAFFE is tardiness.

Menu Readability: The menu is the size of a wakeboard, laminated and slathered in the worst calligraphic typeface, all bold.

Need to mention: While it did get busy that night, not enough that we really had to have given up our seats. Too bad. Being corrected shouldn't be a customer's first interaction with your staff.

What this place teaches me about myself: I probably do have copious amounts of time to burn, I just don't know where it is."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend for summerlicious lunch a year or two ago  .  Cafe La Gaffe is a quaint style cafe for small get togethers   with friends. We sat in the patio on my friends suggestion.  If i had to go back I would have said no since the sun shines  on the phone making it difficult to take pics of the food . 
For  our meal , I got the Duck Salad, and my friend got  a soup. The soup was quite good  because my friend finished it fast. The  Duck salad was a cool refreshment to the hot summer with a good balance of meat, fruits and vegetable  . 
We both got the Risotto ( Arborio Rice with Bay Scallops, Accorean Chorizo, Roasted Red Peppers, Leeks, & Spinach in a Tomato Pesto Broth).  This was my introduction to risotto and I enjoyed the blend of rice, meat and vegetables. It was  spicy in a pleasurable way with out the burn in the mouth . There was a lot of meat which is a surprise considering it was a lunch meal with lunch portions. 
For dessert my friend got Creme Brulee and I got a lemon cheesecake . We enjoyed our desserts .
Our server was quite good and answered all our questions. 
I am  open to returning and I recommend one tries this place as well"}
{"text":"One of my Baldwin Village favourites!

It's a well-established and well-loved spot. 

ATMOSPHERE: Very warm and inviting. It has a cosy atmosphere, almost like a homey french cafe. There's lots of paintings on the wall and the wall themselves are in lovely earthy tones. It's quite a large restaurant with a dining room and an enclosed patio at the back of the restaurant. This is a great place for business lunches, dates, or casual meet-ups.

SERVICE: Good. Pretty standard. Servers are polite and not disruptive during the meal.

PRICE: Very affordable. And due to large portion sizes, I think it is worth every penny, and easily beats out any competition on the street. 

FOOD: They have a VERY extensive menu. Even their Daily Specials menu is a full page long with many, many options. So anyone can find something right for them. I haven't tried anything I did not enjoy. Ranging from soup to salad; pastas to grilled chicken; fish to sandwiches - nothing leaves you wanting.

I have a soft spot for pasta - so that's my usual. It comes with a large helping of pasta, plus a side salad.

Their portions are also quite generous. So bring an empty stomach - or be prepared to pack away half of your entree to save for another meal!

Their brunch and breakfasts are also delectable! So if you're in the area on the weekend, it's a great spot for a hearty brunch.

I highly recommend it: Yes, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"For the longest time, I thought this place was called Cafe La Cafe, because of the cursive on their sign, coupled with my mild illiteracy. I was wrong.

In uni I worked at the other french restaurant on this strip, Bodega. I am going to say, I prefer Bodega's food (and that's saying something great, because I ate it daily for a long, long time and never got sick of it!), but Cafe La Gaffe is pretty great, too. Decked out like a true Parisian bistro, Gaffe is oh-so cute. 

I've loved on their brunch omelettes served with a really well-dressed side salad, and most recently I enjoyed their soup du jour (split pea on a rainy day? you know it!) and their warm brie salad. I wasn't wild about the salad, but I didn't carefully read the description before ordering, so I won't bore you with that. The food is usually superb. 

Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to purchase cafe la gaffe as our summerlicious choice this year. We were very excited as we never really tried French food before. The location of this restaurant is on a beautiful strip, great for an evening date in the city. 

The food was not bad, however it didn't seem like French food as there was more of an Italian/middle eastern flare to the cuisine. However it was not bad nonetheless. In my opinion, if you want strictly French food, try somewhere else. 

The service was great and the staff were pretty helpful. They aren't the greatest at answering the phone or returning calls so your best bet would be to make a reservation online. 

Definitely try it with a grain of salt. It didn't seem Frenchy enough, But good nonetheless."}
