{"text":"Sunday afternoon, around 4:30, I walked in with a group of 4 people.  We were sat right away by a very nice hostess. And we sat, and sat, and sat...for 15 mins we waited for a server that never came. We ended up walking out and heading home. I had high hopes for the Hofbrauhaus, and would have forgiven a wait if they had been packed, but the place was maybe 25% full. I don't know if I'll be in a hurry to head back."}
{"text":"I came here to eat with some colleagues of mine while working at the RNC. I was thrilled to find a truly authentic German restaurant. We were slightly hesitant because of the 3-Star rating but I have to say - pleasantly surprised to find a place with great food, a great atmosphere, and really friendly service. We tried just about everything we could, as evidenced by the pics. I was stuffed when we left! For those in town for the RNC, the only downside was the fee to park ($10) across the street due to all the activity downtown and demand for parking for the convention. HOWEVER, I know that's likely not the case normally. This place was definitely worth the stop...and the price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"Apps were good but  was expecting a home made german pretzel not the one I buy frozen from the grocery. My pork dinner was inedible as it was just a large slice of fat with little meat I was very disappointed since I've read so many good reviews. The waitress did remove it from our bill.  Maybe just a bad night. Atmosphere was fun !
."}
{"text":"Horrible service that got worse over the course of the evening. We had a party of  12. Items we ordered were never served, items we didn't order were served 2-3 times, and our meals were cleared before we finished. Beer orders were similarly confused.  Nonetheless, the attempted to charge for everything (they willingly corrected only after it was called to their attention). Otherwise the food was OK, as was the beer, yet both were way overpriced. Much better German places in Cleveland with better food and the same beer at competitive prices. Run away, run away!!"}
{"text":"We lived in Germany for 5 years. We've wanted to try the hofbrau haus for awhile. We went for lunch and had a wonderful time. The food, beer, and service were all amazing."}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would. The food was terrible. The service was some of the worst I have ever had. Completely understaffed and our poor server was dealing with several tables waiting for food. Took half an hour to get our beers, and over an hour to get pretzels. Compared to other locations, this one should be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the atmosphere. I keep going back!! Bring your friends for shotskis!!!"}
{"text":"Can't write a review. Called for a reservation. Got a recording. Was told they would call back. Never did. Tried 2 more times. Left my number. No call back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were visiting Cleveland for the weekend and the Hofbrauhaus was recommended to us.  I love German food so we decided to give it a try.  It was a Saturday night and the place was super busy.  It was slightly confusing figuring out the layout; there was a line at one door, a sign pointing to a patio, and an outdoor place to order food and drinks.  I decided to ask the people working at the outdoor bar how everything worked.  They were incredibly helpful and explained everything we needed to know.  One of the people I asked for help, Andi, was so helpful in making our experience a pleasant one.  When it started to rain on us while seated on the patio he personally moved us inside and let our waitress know where we were.  Our waitress Uti was very friendly.

The food was was some of the better German food I have had in a restaurant.  Normally I just make it myself from old family recipes.  I ordered the jager schnitzel and my husband ordered the sausage plate.  I thought everything we ordered was very good.  They were also very accommodating about switching sides with the dinners."}
{"text":"Went to the Hofbrauhaus Cleveland on a Friday night, it was great, lots of fun!  It was relatively early yet in the beer hall (as the band stated) but many people were already climbing on top of their seats and swilling the brews!  Didn't see much spilling yet but I am sure that would have happened shortly!  I had the Walleye dinner and my friend had the Schnitzel, both were hot, right out of the oven and were very good.  The wait staff were friendly and make you want to work there!!!!  The beer hall is loud, unruly and you can feel that the later it gets, the rowdier the crowd will become.  As we exited a concert at Playhouse Square, we walked by the huge front windows in the beer hall and the place looked like it was hopping!

The band was great, Fred Ziwich and the International Sound Machine!"}
{"text":"Won't do it again! Made a reservation, arrived after some of the other guests. The hostess told us they were already there???? Great, thanks, didn't bother to tell us where they were seated or direct us to the table, had to find them on our own. Find our party - they've been there 10 minutes, no server has stopped by to get them drinks or greet them. 
Everybody is here - server takes drink order for 8, doesn't write anything down - only half of our drinks show and half of those are wrong??? Any server worth his salt, should be able to take an order from an 8 top without writing anything down. Server starts his litany of apologies. I suspect (correctly) that this will continue throughout our dining experience, Takes over  30 min to get drinks - I know what's coming. After drink issues are solved, one guest requests H20 -takes another 15 minutes. 
Flag down exasperated server, request to place order - out of several items that are standards, such as sauerbraten???. Now we have to ask for cutlery. Dinners arrive in a moderate timely manner. Wouldn't have seemed so long if it hadn't taken an hour to get drinks.
Food is moderate a best. Advertised as authentic German - nothing near what I experienced in Deutschland. Embarrassingly bad! Kraut & mashers were ok, potato cakes were deep fried, onion rings were overcooked on one side and under-cooked on the other. Schnitzel was not pounded to normal standard and over-breaded. Food was appropriately salted, but no other spices detectable. This place seemed to be the MickeyDs of German food. 
Beers were the highlight, Might go back for a drinking binge, but will avoid the food and hope  can get served. Service was absolutely HORRIBLE !"}
{"text":"Expensive. Food is not up to par, majority of it pork. It was a long wait to get seated and then equally long for food, granted they told us before seating us but that was already after 40 mins of waiting in the cold outside. There was a mediocre band playing, tables are cafeteria style and you get seated on long benches, possibly with people you don't know, I could see how this might be considered fun but I wasn't thrilled sitting right next to the band as it blared into my ears. Yeouch."}
{"text":"Went there last Sunday.  The food was excellent and very authentic (from someone that lived in Germany).  Except the Black Forest was the lesser American version.  Would have been 5 stars, but it looses points for service.  To be fair, other tables had great service, we were stuck with an inattentive waitress.  We had to flag down our waitress and ask for refills and order dessert.  When our son's cheeseburger came sans cheese, she didn't have it refired.  They just brought us a slice of cheese.  I would eat there again, but would demand different server."}
{"text":"Wow, simply incredible! As an Eastern European, I am so excited to finally have a Hofbr√§u Haus in Cleveland. The food, the beer, the polka !"}
{"text":"First tip: make a reservation if you can! The line was out the door and around the building but we made a reservation so we got right in. The beer is great! The food is alright but most of the sides aren't fresh but the pork was good. Our server was horrible and I will be contacting the restaurant about her. She mixed up our beer, our food and our bill. The place is busy but you need to be on top of your game if we are dropping $90 for 2 people. We'd go back but would probably just do beer and apps. The portions are large enough to split."}
{"text":"I'm giving 3 stars because the atmosphere and live polka music were great!  On the service and food side of things, they need to do some major improvements.  We were actually seated quickly, but our server was terrible.  Put in an order for beer, but it never showed up.  We had to flag down another person to go get them for us.  The beer was okay, but not amazing.  Once we finally got our food (50 min), we felt that it was good, but not great.  I ordered the Schnitzel Salat, which I thought was decent, but was missing that \"wow\" factor.  The others at our table got sausage, and mashed potato items.  They all liked it, but didn't wow them either.  I mean, it's German food, and it's never been considered the gem of the food world.  You're paying more for the entertainment experience than anything.  One other thing, expect panhandlers.  As soon as we walked out the door, we were harassed by a guy wanting money."}
{"text":"This place is so much fun.  Good beer, fun live band, everyone in here having a great time, dancing on tables, lifting their steins in the air, shot skis going around, delicious sauerkraut balls, etc.  definetely recommended if you like to drink and have fun"}
{"text":"The food and band were wonderful!  Excellent!!  Those are your best incentives to visit. 

Unfortunately, Hofbrau House will not return calls so I hope you don't have a question!   I left a message two days in a row about reservations, no response.   Additionally, the hostess, a small dark brown haired girl was EXTREMELY rude with no provocation.  We were sitting at our table and she came from nowhere with so much attitude!!  Then walked away and was talking about our table to other people.  You do not do that to customers.   

The staff walking through were helpful, attempted to get closed caption on tv so we could see World Series updates, but couldn't figure it out.   The band was fantastic.  

All in all, food great, band great...need a class on customer relations!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and lively, very loud so if that's not your thing be warned.  The live music was great - they even got the kids involved which was fun.  However, the service and food are abysmal.  It took over an hour to get our food and once it did finally show up it was cold.  Not even warm but cold  - clumpy gravy and cold meat and bread dumplings are just gross.  A few of the orders were wrong as well.  Come for the beer, stay for the music, leave and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I am so happy that the Hofbrauhous opened again in Cleveland. I have been to Hofbrauhouses around the world(The one in Munchen Germany) and in the United States. 
I also lived in Germany 8 years, and my father was a chef in German restaurants. Needless to say, I know what good German food is. 

The actual place is huge, with plenty of beer garden tables and booths. The beer garden outside adds way more seating and it is a lot of fun during summer hours. 

The food is my favorite part. I have not eaten at a better German restaurant in the United States, then the Haufbrauhous. The menu is vast and very original with perfect execution. Prices are expensive, however the quality of indigence and the preparation of the dishes justify the price. 
All the Schnitzel dishes are perfectly done, it truly reminded me of eating in Germany. The apps are great and awesome to share with friends or a date. I would recommend anything on the menu. 

The beer selection is legendary. They make their own beers with German brew-masters and old purity laws. Some might think the liter beers are over priced, again the process and quality of the beer makes up for the price. 

The staff is great! Very helpful with the menu to people that don't know what the food is. Fast service with a smile. It can get very busy, but the staff handles the crowd perfectly. 

I gave 5 stars because of great food, authenticity, and service. The only complain I have ( really nitpicking) is the location. Sometimes people in the area with ask for money, and the area can be dangerous late at night."}
{"text":"I don't understand all of the bad reviews on here, as I've been to Hofbrauhaus twice and have had an excellent experience both times. The servers are friendly, and the atmosphere is a ton of fun. There is live German music every night, and audience participation is encouraged. The beer is excellent, and I've also enjoyed the food. During my first visit, I had the Wurstlplatte, which is a sausage plate. It was excellent, and I enjoyed sampling the different sausages. During my second visit, I had the Schnitzel Weiner Art, which was crispy and not even the slightest bit greasy. I will say that the service is not the fastest, but if you're not in a hurry and feel like relaxing and enjoying yourself, the Hofbrauhaus is an excellent place to go."}
{"text":"Five stars without a doubt! Awesome service from our waitress Jenna. Very friendly staff. The owner came over and spoke with us. Super lady!!  Food was perfect.  Try the roast pork dumplings and sauerkraut.  And the brew was on point! Jefe Wiezen bier had a banana taste on the pallet. Intriguing flavor. Sure to go back when in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience at the Hafbrauhaus yesterday. A group of us went there for some beers, music, and dinner. The restaurant was fairly empty. After dropping off a round of drinks, our waitress disappeared for more than 40 minutes. Several people joined our party during that time, she still didn't return. We tried to flag her down, eventually someone got up and asked her to return to take food orders and the orders of the new arrivals. When she returned to the table (15 minutes later) she announced that no one would be served any more beer and that we were all cut off due to a \"new policy.\" Most of us had yet to work out way through a third of our first beer, she applied this edict to the new arrivals as well until we finally had to request a manager. All the time we'd been trying to get her attention we watched her bring beer after beer to a large party sitting behind us. She clearly was annoyed that we had the audacity to request service and decided to try and get us to leave. It is one thing to refuse service to a group of intoxicated individuals, but we'd only just arrived and not only wanted drinks but food and just basic service as well. I'm not sure what our table did, beyond offend her delicate sensibilities by requesting service from a waitress, but the overall experience was absolutely terrible. In the past I've overlooked the overpriced, under flavored food in favor of a fun atmosphere with cheerful service. That part of this establishment is clearly through, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Not worth the cost. Service was satisfactory. Did not leave with a desire to return. Live music was great!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Hofbrau house. We were a group of 11, and we had a wonderful time. We sampled quite a number of items on the menu, and everything we had was delicious. Our server, Harold, was the best. Very accommodating, full of energy, & a lot of fun. I will definitely return. The  only negative I can comment on is the long wait to get a table. Our party began to arrive around 10 minutes after 4 in the afternoon, with the rest of us arriving around 5 o'clock. They could come up with a better plan for easing the wait. It was a chilly and rainy night and people had to wait outside to get seated. Overall I would give it a four and a half star rating. It is a new establishment, and they have a few issues to still work out. I'm glad we gave it a try, and would love to return in the near future."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch and was disappointed with the food. Ordered the schnitzel sandwich and it took most of my lunch hour before it was served. The sandwich was basically tasteless and dry.  I asked for something to put on it and was given mayonnaise.
I was expecting this to be more of a foodie place, but then thought that the beer is probably their specialty. Asked someone at my table who had a beer what they thought of it and they also were not impressed. Maybe the service and food will improve as they get more established.On a positive note, they do give you a lot of food and the apple kraut was tasty."}
{"text":"The family took me here for Father's Day brunch. Not good at all !!! The service was extremely slow. They could not keep up with the food and clean plates. They reduced our bill when my son in law complained. I will give them one more shot with a regular menu. There are too many good restaurants in Cuyahoga County for this type of food and service."}
{"text":"This place was such a wonderful surprise.Made a reservation on Open Table during the football game and showed up to find a fun location with great music, hospitable staff and wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Soup I ordered was cold.  My friend had to return her potato pancakes 3 times for being burnt.  Strudel was soggy.  others in our group never got their orders until we were ready to leave (2 hours) later.  they had to have their dinners boxed up.  Would rather go to Sterle's."}
{"text":"Very rowdy place- definitely boisterous and fun.  It isn't like any other restaurant in the Cleveland area.   The only complaint I would have would be the nighttime band on Friday and Saturday nights.  They play the same songs and do the same act every night they play, so I can't see this being a place I visit weekend after weekend.   But on the up side they have a smoking short blonde bartender that I'd pay another visit to."}
{"text":"Food was outstanding, service great and the atmosphere great.   Needed more people on valet."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is fun and friendly. Service was excellent, but the food left a lot to be desired.  Restaurant is great for having beer with friend, but if hungry, I would find somewhere else to satisfy your appetite."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely flavorless- just get the beer. Got the $28 meal expecting a feast- got rip off. Everything on the plate was boiled flavorless."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great and food is relatively good coupled with a good German beer selection brewed in restaurant, but service is very subpar. Line was very long and a lot of the staff seemed unsure how to solve the problem. Waited over an hour for food and even longer for our waiter to bring check"}
{"text":"The place is fun and energetic. However the service is HORRIBLE. After waiting for 2-3 hours in line, you then get looked over for 20 mins to place your order, and then you're lucky if they get it right. We were with a large party and all said we wanted to be on separate checks (couples) and at the end of the night the waitress brought over one check that was close to $500. There was no way we could figure out who had what so thankfully the manager agreed on $75 per couple. I have been to this location 3 times, and probably will not return. I have heard the Pittsburgh location is much better so I will make the 1.5 hour drive to check it out."}
{"text":"Came here for a company holiday party. I was pleasantly surprised by the food. Our party got a mini buffet of several of the restaurants specialties. Highlights include; fried pickles, beef stroganoff, and waitors in traditional German costumes. 
A good place to bring a date or the family. I will be back with mine."}
{"text":"Such a unique experience!  It was amazing and the food was great,  we had so much fun and with the whole family and I've gone back so many times. It can accommodate for any dinner you're looking to have from calm and quiet to crazy and fun"}
{"text":"The food is authentic German food, and the environment is authentic German! Dogs are welcome at their outdoor bier garden. The food was so-so. It was too salty and greasy. The only two things that I would recommend are the pretzels and the beer."}
{"text":"A great place if you're a 30-60 yo white person with some money to spend. The food is meh. The beer was pretty good, and I think very reasonably priced. There is definitely a fun atmosphere when you're here. The service I had with my last visit, though, was HORRIBLE. We had Sandy. I know our group was rowdy, but damn Sandy did not have to be so RUDE. She was frequently in my personal space, having no qualms with just reaching over me. She ignored out table for most of the time we were there. Not great. Everyone else was great, though."}
{"text":"Have been to the Hofbauhaus twice and had two great experiences.   The food was great, the staff were awesome and the entertainment was amazing.  What a great place to hang out and enjoy your friends.   Cannot wait for the patio to open!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, the second time was this past Saturday. I got there at 5:45PM-ish, and waiting nearly two hours in line. We were forewarned by the valet about the wait time, chose to stick it out. They offered beer in line, even with a friendly waitress to bring you orders or you could go wait in line and get it yourself. The wait is brutal, but the food was well worth it. It is a rowdy beerhall for sure, but that's why you go there. I got the sauerbrauten, which was very, very good. Klaus, our waiter, was friendly and helpful. There is a bunch of dancing on your benches, or through the walkways, but it is a very festive atmosphere. 

I served in the army in West Germany and was there when the wall came down in 1989, so I have experienced the true Hofbrau Haus, and this is dead-on. The beer is flown in from Germany, and while the staff is new here, and is learning, the food, beer, and atmosphere well makes up for any issues one may have with the wait staff.

If you get a chance, GO!!!"}
{"text":"So, it's great that this massive biergarden/resto has activated Chester Avenue across from the Greyhound Station.   As I strolled toward HH last night, I was struck by how many more people were on Chester.   Many, many more than Ive seen in the past.

That's great.

However, aside from  2-3 bright spots, Im afraid to say that HH's soft opening is not going well from a service perspective and the quality/value of their food is poor.

What's good?

The physical space is beautiful.  It's a wide open, boisterous frat party atmosphere ...even on a Wednesday night.   With the polka band playing, the crowd large and vocal and an overall mood of \"Let's party\", the moment you step in the door, through an entryway half-heartedly stocked with over-priced t-shirts and steins, you know the purpose is for you to have a blast.

Also good?   Bar snacks.    The two our group tried were fresh, tasty and enjoyable.   The pretzels hawked from baskets, for cash only, are soft, perfectly salty and accompanied by a tangy mustard.   Perfect.   Secondly, the ping-pong sized sauerkraut balls eventually arrived (more on this later and they may have been another group's that we snagged out of desperation) and they were good.  Six round balls of fresh-tasting kraut were served with a creamy mustard that accented the greasy treats perfectly.   Win on both.

Finally, the seating is fun.   Packed in at long tables with strangers sounds less fun than it is.   We had a lot of social time with three CWRU neuroscience students who were good-natured, chatty and charming.

The beer is fine, but not remarkable.   We are spoiled here in CLE with great breweries.   HH has a lot of competition and Im not sure their Deutschland recipes are all that special as to warrant a special trip.   Again, its ok beer, but the dark, Oktoberfest and wheat beer wereacceptable but nothing special.

The bad?    Too many to list, but I'll give the highlights.

Service time.  We waited ONE HOUR AND TWENTY minutes from the moment we placed our food order until it FINALLY (FINALLY!) arrived.   Repeated attempts to find our server and multiple requests as to our food location brought the same wan response \"I'll check on it\".   Yes, it's a soft opening, but that is ridiculous.

We witnessed multiple double orders (guests were served their food, then 5 minutes later a runner brought the same folks the same order of food, which was obviously a duplicate order.). Massive staff confusion and back/forth.   There's a problem in the kitchen.

Once our mains FINALLY arrived, the server, because of room flow, could not get to our location and had to pass our food down the table through four other guests to reach us.   The food was not worth the wait.   A pasta dish was barely better than Kraft Mac and Cheese and the side salad that was to accompany it was nonexistent and never made it out of the kitchen.   A pork dish was sloppily sauced with leaden dumplings and an unappealing presentation with food \"bunched up\"on one side of the plate.    An entree salad had poor quality lettuce with a deep fried pork cutlet hacked into pieces and dumped on top with a warm bacon dressing that looked eerily like jarred chicken gravy.    All at a premium price.    Im happy to pay $15 bucks for good pasta, but for something I can make at home for much less, I expect something that tastes good.

As for room flow, there is a focus on maximizing space to increase revenue, but it comes at the expense of providing a smooth traffic flow.   In the NW corner of the cavernous room, there is no way for servers to circulate without going all the way around a huge room and then backtracking.    Remove one table to create an easy way to circulate.   This one needs to happen STAT.

There are not enough menus, silverware, or napkins available.   Repeated requests for these items brought zero response.   We ended up cadging all of these items by travelling to other tables and patching them together (2 napkins here, 1 napkin there - thank goodness for the kindness of strangers.).  

The polka band is fun, but in the cavernous space, it is LOUD.   There is no chance of conversation.   Know before you go, anything beyond 1-3 word shouting comments is nigh impossible.   This is the kind of place it is, so be aware.   

All told, even if this was a soft opening, the beer is not anything special, the food value is poor/nonexistent and the systems (which are expected to be shaky during a soft opening) are SO BAD that it's going to take several months to shake them out.

I won't be back.   Too many other great locations in CLE.   I wish them the best, but don't have high hopes.   It appears that this new venture is relying on the brand \"sizzle\" (a Hofbrauhaus here!  Yay!) without investing in the core \"steak\" of excellent beer, toothsome, hearty food and effiecient service.

Nein, Hofbrauhaus Haus, nein."}
{"text":"I had such an amazing meal here when I was visiting friends in Cleveland. This has to be the biggest German restaurant I've ever seen. I ate at the bar and Amanda Rider took care of our group. I don't usually remember my servers whole name, but when I do it's because the service was above and beyond what I ever expected at such a busy beer hall. I would definitely come here again, but only if Amanda is working!"}
{"text":"Warning if you are going for happy hour...ask to see what time the register/computer has!  I recommended Hofbrauhuas as a place to eat before a show at Playhouse Square, with a friend.  When I was seated, I asked the waitress if the happy hour beer specials were in the bar only, or the whole restaurant.  The waitress said in the whole restaurant, until 6pm.  I said great, as it is 5:55pm, so I ordered a beer for my friend and myself.  When we got our check, the beers were full price.  When I inquired, the waitress advised that it is priced based on the computer screen and there was nothing she could do.  I asked to talk to the manager and was told \"it will take a long time, as she is very busy and in the basement getting things.\"  She then proceeded to tell me that if I wait, I may miss my show.  I was appalled by her attitude, so I proceeded to wait 15 min.  I could see the waitress talking with the manager, and she came back with a 20% employee discount, instead of the happy hour 50% off.  She again said the manager was very busy.  At that point, we left.  It is a shame, as the food was very good, but the service was very poor."}
{"text":"Wow. Epically slow service. While waiting for a table no one acknowledged our presence. Then a woman finally said how many and walked us to our table. We're seated for 10 minutes before we saw menus. My wife got them for us. Took 25 minutes to get our 1st and only beers. Food was delicious but apps and entrees were served together.  Literally, 3 minutes after getting our beer."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. In a city with fantastic craft beer operations I was hoping that this concept would offer up some less snobby fun and boozing. It failed in the worst way possible. Why you ask? Well first, although cavernous it has a grand total of 4 screens on which to take OSU, Browns or Indians. That's just dumb in a town that bark, chants and sells out games in -10 weather. Not terrible you say? Okay well in addition the menu is \"in flux\" which apparently means the waiter will have to circle the stuff the actually have on each menu and when I did order the Reuben was swampy, having sat so long that the toast was now mush. Bad day in the kitchen you say. Well, okay, maybe, but the clincher for why I will never spend 10$ to park here again, that's easy. Choke down some of the Reuben, push the plate to the edge of the bar but before the bartender can remove it, the smelly guy at the bar reaches over and starts chowing down. Classy."}
{"text":"Ordered pierogies with mettwurst entree. Good, but skimpy portion of meat; more like an appetizer than an entree. Very flavorful dish and pierogies cooked perfectly. BUT there were only four small slices of mettwurst, certainly not a full dinner portion of protein. I've ordered this before and there was plenty of meat. Not this time. Waiter said kitchen informs him they plated everything perfectly and don't make mistakes. I was appalled with the arrogance. Basically an expensive side dish with meat flavoring."}
{"text":"Came here today to watch Browns before visiting Playhouse for show at 3.  Looking forward to Wiener schnitzel...and they were out.  What German place is out on Wiener schnitzel on a Sunday afternoon..."}
{"text":"Great food. Bier. Music and people. Killer space. Make sure to ask for Mark as your server. He's the best around, great knowledge makes for a good time."}
{"text":"The food is just ok and I base that opinion on being raised in a Bohemian household. But the atmosphere is like no other. Don't expect to carry on a conversation, but that's the beauty of the place. Oh by the way, the service was pretty damn   good considering the complete chaos."}
{"text":"Very good atmosphere. The band gets the crowd going. Food is OK, not great. Large portions but more Americanized German, not true German. Beer is very good and along the lines of traditional German beer. Don't expect IPA."}
{"text":"So I'll first say that I may have a biased opinion since my family is from munich and spent several summers out there. 

Atmosphere is a lot of fun. Band is fine. Wouldn't mind some more Bavarian singing. Beer of course really takes me back and very reasonably priced. The food probably hurt my review the most. Nothing more than average and more expensive than it should be. Hoping the food and menu improves once they settle in a bit more now that the soft and grand openings have passed. One request that would totally make my day is adding pear schnapps to the drink menu, and it's nothing like peach schnapps."}
{"text":"The wife and I had dinner here last night. Great atmosphere good beer quick tasty food. Only problem was waiting in line outside for 40 minutes. Good thing is they have a beer station outside so that makes waiting in line a lot better!"}
{"text":"The lighting is really bright inside. I mean really bright! There will be no ambiance to be found here. Waited at table forever just to get beer order placed. Placed food order at same time since the initial wait was so long. The group next to us had our same server and we got our food before them even though they had ordered before we even got there. The waitress brought us an extra beer that we didn't order. The waitress wouldn't take it back. She argued that we had ordered it. They never brought out salad for one member of our table. My dinner never arrived. She brought out a salad which I didn't order and argued that I did. She said I ordered the last item on the menu. When I showed her the menu and the last item was the Sausage loaf with pretzel bun she said they had changed the menu. She took the salad back and about a half hour later after everyone at our table had their meal she informed me they were out of the Sausage loaf. She messed up the bills among our table and took forever to correct it. She still had it wrong but we gave up at that point.. She was the absolute worst waitress I have ever had. The beer was good. Oh, did I mention the lights were bright? Too bad our waitress wasn't."}
{"text":"Terrible.  They called me and told me I won free tickets to a comedy show at Bonkers inside of Hofbr√§uhaus.  My wife and I took a cab downtown to see the show.  We get there and they say, we had free tickets for you but we sold them, sorry about your luck, bye.  I have never been so insulted.  The only reason I went there was because they called me and told me I \"won\" free tickets.  I will never set foot in this establishment again."}
{"text":"This place was the best part of my trip to Cleveland. If you want to get good German food and beer this is the place. People in the restaurant all looked like they were having fun. I know I had a big smile on my face the hole time. I wish I found this place earlier this week. I think I would have gone back. Fun for the hole family. If I ever come back to Cleveland I'll be coming for dinner here."}
{"text":"Had one of the worst dinner experiences ever.  Waited over two hours and still no main entre.  Waitress was a dream but the people that cook the food need to up their game. Two hours of mylife I can't get back.
NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Awesome staff,  great music.   If want to to enjoy a great interactive night of polka,   check it out.   If you have never been to a polka bar,  you have to come here and try it.   Wow,  what a great experience!!"}
{"text":"Not worth your time, energy, or effort.  Had heard that service was bad, which we promptly ignored because my husband and I had come here on a weekend afternoon and service was fine.  Fast forward to 5:30 on a Saturday night and, wow, I get it now.  Awful is the best way I can describe it.  I can vouch for the fact that the food, the beer, and even the atmosphere are not worth it.  

We were a group of 7 that chose to arrive early due to our group size and reports that it can take a while to get seated.  We were good with a bit of a wait; however, learned that there is NO system to manage being seated or the crowd (READ, they don't even take down your name or party size).  They originally quoted 25-45 minutes to be seated.  It became clear after 60 minutes that people either know people who work there or slip the hostess money  to jump the line.  We watched several parties miraculously be fetched from back in line and be seated ahead of many angry people, ourselves included.  After 75 minutes and having been near the front of the line for about 30 of those minutes and watching several large groups leave the restaurant....we inquired about the wait time again. With a straight face, we were told it would be another 60 minutes!  Wait, with one group ahead of us, what?  We left and enjoyed a great evening at Batiste and Dupree.

Warning, the majority of your wait will be outside in the cold, under the vinyl tent....where there are no heaters.  Brilliant strategy though, they sell a lot of beer to people standing in line.  Also, use caution about valet parking.  You will be charged the full $20 regardless of your experience.  

Skip this nonsense and go enjoy a night at Sterle's Country House just down the street (55th), Das Schnitzel Haus in Parma, or even Der Braumeister on Lorain in Cleveland.   Hofbrauhaus clearly could care less about their customers.  At least, they don't at the present time, presumably because their tables are filling."}
{"text":"Went Friday May 15th 2015 just to try the beer. I had a Wheat beer, and the regular Lager, and placed an order for onion rings. Both beers were very good, and the onion rings are huge! There was a decent Polka band doing Neil Diamond covers as well as other songs in between the Polka tunes, and the atmosphere is very casual (and noisy). Servers were very friendly and helpful also. The only drawback is the lighting.  It was so bright , I kept expecting planes to land on me. I was seated at the bar, so it may be a little better in the main area, but I doubt it. 
I would definitely recommend it if you are there for a fun time, probably wouldn't take a date there expecting quiet conversation."}
{"text":"Lots of fun!  Huge beers, good food, great people watching - we were there Saturday night around 9:00 and the place was full of excitement, band playing polkas to oldies, people dancing on the benches, shotskis were flowing.  As soon as the band ended the place emptied out - waiter was not exceptional, but a ton of fun, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Waited for two hours did not get food. Ordered of lunch menu and was told they were no longer serving lunch. Ordered off dinner menu and food did not come for two hours. Decided to leave. Manager gave us inactivated gift cards. Terrible service."}
{"text":"I have been to Munich during Oktoberfest a few times.  The Hofbrauhaus is very close!  The crowds are lively as it should be!  Sure, you are going to wait in a long line at times.  Unlike the other reviewer who thought she was too special to wait, I did not mind.

A fun place to have a good time with a lot of singing and laughter."}
{"text":"Friendly service... ordered sampler platter...Not bad but should have stuck with fried pickles only.  Son ordered chicken and mushroom sauce with spaetzle and I ordered traditional Viener schnitzel. Food was good but not sensational. That may be due to the fact that traditional German food tends toward comfort food , i.e. bland. Very good for what it is. I would definitely go back when the band is playing and my wife and I could dance."}
{"text":"I used to frequent the Hofbr√§uhaus in Pittsburgh quite a lot before I moved to Cleveland. I was considering driving all the way there when I discovered there's one close to home. 

The Hofbr√§uhaus is a traditional German beer hall modeled after the one in Munich. Make no mistake, this is an official franchise. 

They brew their beer on site and it comes in half-liter or liter sizes. There are other drinks available, but if you're going to a German beer hall you might as well get beer. The Hefeweizen is a delicious light wheat beer with a little sweetness. 

Appetizers and food are traditional German fare, so it's not great if you're trying to stick to a diet. Schnitzel, wurst, pretzels, sauerkraut, fried onions, etc. are all delicious additions to any beer. 

There's always live music, even for lunch (at least on weekends). I've found that during weekend lunch music is traditional German music with accordions, etc. but on the Sunday I was there for dinner the music was a mix of classic rock and country."}
{"text":"I used to live in Cincinnati and therefore I used to frequent the Hofbrauhaus in Newport, KY and therefore knew what kind of atmosphere to expect. I was very disappointed by my experience here in Cleveland. 

To be quite honest the night started out wonderful! There were 5 of us and we didn't have to wait for a table! We ordered drinks and our waiter answered all of our questions we had about the menu. The food is sub par - if that. The bier cheese tastes just like the crappy cheese that comes out of a mass produced can (no beer flavor whatsoever).  But let's be honest no one really comes for the food. Everyone comes for the beer, shot-ski's and the entertainment (at one point in the night the man next to me took his shirt off- ha ha). 

The point in the night that made me dislike this place so much is when our waiter decided to disappear for over an hour. Maybe disappear is the wrong term because we did eventually watch him serve other tables so he was working but decided that he wouldn't stop by our table anymore. Once we decided to complain to the manager it still took a good 15 minutes for our waiter to come over! Unbelievable! 

The band was awesome, the atmosphere was awesome and you can never go wrong with beers larger than your head! To have such terrible service anywhere really makes you want to avoid a place for quite sometime!"}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed coming here for special occasions, we love the rowdy atmosphere and the beer. This last time we went though (3/19/16) something had changed. The food was mediocre, the menu completely different (higher prices as well) and the crowd was un-controlled. There were multiple fights between patrons, although taken of quickly by security, that caused issues. It may be a little while before we come back to the Cleveland Hofbrauhaus....."}
{"text":"This place is always completely wall-to-wall packed. This could be because of the novelty of it or because their food is actually delicious! 

I prefer to stay outside on the gigantic patio/beer garden when possible to avoid noise and overcrowding. Inside is pretty fun, too, though, with the live music and rowdy dancing drinkers. The beer isn't the draw here for me...it's just beer as far as I can tell--the big deal are the mugs that I can barely lift with one hand. 

Pretzels are OK. Not the best soft pretzels ever but they do their job. The pierogies, though. WOW. The plate of food is HUGE, but it reheats (or chills, even) well so leftovers are not a problem! 

Overall, no problems with Hofbrauhaus. It just takes a lot of mental and emotional preparation for me to handle the crowd and noise level."}
{"text":"Food was authentic, says my Polish friend who lived in Germany.   Service and drinks were also great."}
{"text":"Definitely a very fun atmosphere, but come prepared to spend some money! Also, our service was quite slow but I understand that will happen when you visit a busy place."}
{"text":"What a fun night!  Sitting at long, communal tables and surrounded by people in the gigantic dining room watching the band play, it was a great time.   My party of four luckily was seated on a Saturday night within minutes of arriving.  I had a 1/2 liter hefeweizen and the big bavarian pretzel to start.  For dinner, I had the sauerbraten.  The others in my group had the Schnitzelsemmel (breaded chicken breast sandwich) and a vegeterian schnitzel.

The atmosphere was all about fun - the band leader was engaging; the crowd was into it, and people were laughing and having a good time throughout the restaurant.

Our bill, for four people, including drinks and tip, was around $110.  Not bad for a Saturday night out.  There was no extra charge for the fun we had! 

For a good time with locally made German beer and food, this is the place in CLE."}
{"text":"Always a party here! From guests dancing on tables to families enjoying a casual shot-ski in every corner. Beer is GREAT and food is some of the most authentic German around. A tad pricey so your best bet is to come during happy hour if possible (3-6) where beers and apps are half price. Prost!"}
{"text":"I had a great time at the Sunday buffet, it is like $21 a person but it is a good time for everyone and I would recommend taking the plunge. The important part, the selection: when we arrived there was Chicken, Fish, and mixed wurst in sauerkraut, eggs waffle, omelet person, several desserts (Black Forest Cake, Strudel (apple), assorted breakfast pastries, etc) there were bavarian pretzels with cheese, salad, fried potatoes and some more. Later they switched around 2pm to spaetzle, pirogies, schnitzel, dumpling, and many of the previous items. It was crowded when we arrived around 12:30pm and then it slowed and then regrouped soon after. Our waiter was good but service is not very fast but it is okay nonetheless. They had live music which got people dancing and having a good time. I was too focused on food to realize what was going on but otherwise if you have time and you have a bunch of friends who are extroverted, you will likely end up standing on the table (which is encouraged!) Played polkas and german tunes for the most part of the brunch and the band was very good. It is sort of expensive but overall worth a trip. I got my fill as I just moved downtown again so it is exciting to get to try the buffet which they do not really advertise but I found it nonetheless"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to dinner here with my brother and sister in law before the Jim Gaffigan show at the Wolstein Center. We thought it would be a fun place. We ordered a large pretzel and beers while we waited for our food. My brother in law and his wife ordered the perogies and Schweinebraten, while my husband ordered the Rueben sandwich and I the grilled chicken with mushroom sauce and spatzels. Everyone enjoyed the food and the waitress was really friendly so you would think that I would give it 5 stars, but I can't. Within 2 hours of eating I started to feel uncomfortable. Thank god I made it through the show and home. I ended up with horrible food poisoning. My husband had two bites from my plate and had a mild case. I'm sorry, but there should never be 'spoiled' food served to any guest."}
{"text":"Check your bill to see if they charge you correctly. I came in for lunch and ordered off the lunch menu, but was charged for dinner prices on my of the items I ordered. This made my bill about $10 more than it should have. 

The service is something to be desired. I sat at the bar; someone delivered my food and Gregory never asked how things were as the red cabbage was nasty and sour. 

Save your time and go someplace else as this place is over rated.  I also thought it was strange as I received my bill before I even got any of my food. I didn't look at it until after my meal as Gregory wasn't attentive."}
{"text":"What a really fun place.  The food is pretty good.  Having lived in Germany for a few years I can say this is closer than any other place I have tried.  Not real keen on the deserts though, very pre made.

So we had the Jaeger schnitzel, a biermeister schnitzel, some Werst plate, sauerkraut balls (fried), and an apfelstrudel under German chocolate cake.

All of the mains were good as I mentioned before.  The sauerkraut balls were uber gute.  The cake und strudel were not so much.  Both cold and dry.

The atmosphere and music are fantastic.  The bier is big, cold and wet.  Tones of fun."}
{"text":"Having lived in Munich, I was expecting something at least resembling a German biergarten.  Instead what I got was what the owners of T.G.I. Friday's probably think a biergarten is supposed to be.

On top of that, we too had to stand outside in the cold to wait in line to get in despite half of our reservation already being seated (like other reviewers have said.

It was a fairly busy night, but nevertheless the staff was overtly rude and distracted.  I saw a lot of running around and not a lot of people actually getting served...

I probably won't be back.

Their beer is good though."}
{"text":"Yaya beer is it. I had the Schnitzle and it's huge but not quite authentic enuf for me. I did eat it tho. Pretzel was good with mustard and beer cheese sauce too. I got a Schnitzle salad for my Bf and he loved it ! Growing up there the ambiance is authentic. If the Schnitzle was pounded quite a bit thinner and cooked in clarified butter... then u would be up my alley. But it was good enuf cause I was hungry. 
   Passing thru town. We were loading in a show at The State Theatre next door.
   I DID buy two small mugs for our BAR at home tho. That's what they served ice tea in today. Nice!"}
{"text":"ONE MORE TIME CAN SOMEBODY EXPLAIN TO ME WHY ALL THESE LIGHT ARE ON? GOSH. This place was a good/great time for those who are in or around the young age. YUM, comes to mind when thinking about the coldest beers in Cleveland that are served just down the street from here. But this place has cold beers too. Laso (also), there is a wide variety on draft. The beer mugs are taller than expected. So if you're under 5ft then you might wanna think about having your boyfriend hold your beer. If if you're a guy under 5ft, then GROW (up). OR hit puberty, and congrats btw on the fake ID.

In serious languages, this place has an incredibly fun vibe. Cya. YELP!"}
{"text":"Been to Cincy and loved it. This's place has terribly SLOW service. 44 mins to get a drink. Called for the manager, some guy shows up and I ask \"you the owner\" he says \"unfortunately I am the owner\". Seriously! 20 minutes later and we get our four beers. Waitress foot was phenomenal but we paid our bill and left anyways. Not that we wanted it but nothing was comped by the owner. Only two bartenders for 200+ people.SAD"}
{"text":"We had dinner with 6 of our neighbors. 
Hauf Brau handled it very well where many restaurants freak out when  you have a party if 8.
Food was great portions huge. My Schnitzel was the size of a small pizza. 
Parking is conveniently right across the street."}
{"text":"Holy Shotskis batman! Yes. This is a chain. Yes. It's pretty similar to the others. However this location is fairly new and everyone (both patrons and waitstaff) were very friendly. The place was clean the food was tasty and pretty fast and the beers were of course good and cold. The shotskis were fun and tasty as well. I did enjoy their regional special pirogies which made the experience different from some of the other locations. I also enjoyed the band and the fun environment. If I am ever in Cleveland again I would definitely come back for more shotskis!!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first time coming here and it was fantastic! Your definitely paying more for the experience (food is very average). I suggest you get here early on the weekends or expect a 3 hr wait. The atmosphere is really what your going for. Live band, people standing on tables dancing, and SHOT SKIS!

Food quality wasn't authentic by any means but not horrible. I got the breaded pork cutlet with sauerkraut. Big portions but expect to pay around $14-$24 per entree. If I went back I would just drink and eat the appetizers which were good and not too pricey. If your with a large party and looking to go out and get hammered...this is the place to experience. Not recommended if your trying to go out and have more of a quiet night out. SHOT SKIIIIIIS!"}
{"text":"This place is huge and beautiful. I love the Haunted Mansion feeling of the ballroom upstairs with the cute Seven Dwarves chairs lining long tables.

I'd like to come back when it's not quite so busy. Long lines & loud.But the people watching is superb. Beers are big and lovely, and the pierogi was good. Staff was nice even with the crowd bursting the rafters."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place on the planet! The atmosphere and food are excellent, but the best part of our visit was our waiter Mike, who was both hilarious and fun."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre beyond description. I don't leave too many reviews, especially not negative ones, but Hofbrauhaus warranted it in every way.

First, let me start out by saying how irritating it is to wait out in the cold for a bite to eat for ALMOST TWO HOURS. My parents and I went here as a sort of goodbye dinner, as I was flying back to Maryland after the holidays. I would wait this long for an overall excellent dining experience, but that was not the case for this restaurant. 

While we were waiting in line, my mother and I bought 1/2 liters of so-so beer which came in glass steins. There were only two of the four or so kinds available. The staff was indescribably slow to fill everyone's orders and terribly rude and unfriendly. At one point, we overheard one of the barmaids say, \"what do you want\" to a customer.

When we finally were seated, a server took a while to come by and take our drink orders. The environment of drunk asshole club-types dancing on tables to the tune of trite 50s classics like \"Sweet Caroline\" and \"Hey Baby\" was unexpected and obnoxious. Granted, I came in not expecting anything, but if I wanted to be surrounded by 30- and 40-somethings who haven't grown out of their clubbing years, I'd have gone to one of the plethora of lame bars full of washed-up has-beens trying to relive their college years that are plentiful in this area.

When our food arrived ten minutes after the people in the same booth as us, and we had ordered at the same exact time, AND our waitress copped an attitude about it when we asked her what was going on, that was the death knell for Hofbrauhaus. If I could give a rating of \"ew\" for this place, you can bet I would.

Then we brought a manager around to complain, and he was patient, kind, and very understanding. And he took off 50% from the bill to compensate for the overall bad experience (but especially the server's behavior and waiting time for the food). So that slightly made up for it, but there really were no redeeming qualities about this place. I will not be returning here."}
{"text":"Oh my god. I don't even believe in god but that's all I can think to say. This might have been THE worst dining experience I've ever had. Like, no cap this was horrible. I walked in and BOOM an hour wait. I wait because I've heard good things about the place. Once I finally get in loud obnoxious music and drunk people everywhere, up on the tables, dancing around, and even in a conga line. I don't get to order for about 50 minuets and when I do it's so loud I doubt the waitress even heard what I said. In the time between ordering and getting my food I played tic tac toe with a random drunk man, who I thought was a house magician. He wasn't even good. I was served some horrible appetizers and some terrifyingly disgusting bread and then finally received my food. Aaaand it's the wrong thing. Turns out the person next to me got mine and I got theirs. They took a bite and gave it to me like nothing happened. The food was devastatingly horrible. An all around horrendous experience is what you'll get if you eat here"}
{"text":"I've always had a blast at Hof! The energy and music is so upbeat! Don't come here for a nice sit-down chat cause you won't hear your friends over the music anyway plus you don't want to miss out on the polka dancing!! Beer-cheese sauce is creamy and tasty. Only sad thing is the bier garden has a view of the streets and parking lots instead of waterfront."}
{"text":"Before you consider going to Hofbrahaus for dinner on a weekend please ask yourself the following questions: do you love waiting in line? Do you like waiting an hour for your beer? Do you enjoy watching middle aged people black out and make fools of themselves? If you answered yes to these questions then Hofbrahaus is the place for you. 

In all seriousness I don't think I've ever had a pleasant experience here. I've never waited in line for less than 45 minutes (even when we called ahead with a large group). When I've had dinner there it was usually just fried to hell and very dense, heavy food. One time I even had sauerkraut balls... Terrible. Never again. Not the kind of meal I want if I'm going to be binge drinking. When it is time to get a drink the wait is usually almost as long as the line to get in the front door. I like beer, but I wasn't particularly impressed with their house beers. The atmosphere is kind of fun, but it loses its luster when you see older people getting wasted and taking pictures like they're on Spring Break '33. The polka covers are clever and fun, but when people at your family style table stand on the bench to scream and chant while you're trying to calmly talk to friends, it gets a little awkward. 

Final verdict: I really, strongly dislike this place. I could rant for days about my issues with Hofbrahaus."}
{"text":"After coming here a few times, I think I've got the experience down:

First, you're gonna wait in line. If its a weekend, possibly for a few hours. But be a pro, get a line beer (you'll want a large), and pretend you're at the Muni Lot.  

Finally got a table? Good. Get another beer, and order some food. I recommend the schnitzel - it's roughly the size of a hubcap, fried perfectly, then smothered in beer cheese sauce and sauteed ham. They had me at \"beer cheese sauce.\" 

Then, since you waited in line for a few hours, you'll sit at your table for a few hours, drink about 4 liters too much beer, and end up eating all that schnitzel, wearing an alarming portion of that cheese sauce in the process (not that its a bad thing), having a few shot-skis, forgetting about the schnitzel, then wolfing down a few pretzels. The live music will be cranking, and you'll have a shouting match of a conversation with the person next to you.

Then you'll go home stuffed, drunk, ears ringing, and senses overloaded. So, I'm conflicted about Hofbrauhaus... there's a lot going for it, but you've got to be prepared for the full-on sensory overload experience. There's another, quieter room... but that's not why you go. You go for the excess of it all, and worry about the consequences later."}
{"text":"The place looks like a lot of fun. Went one afternoon and sat outside. They let us sample all the beer(6 options) and we hated all of them. I'd go back to try the food but definitely won't be getting a drink!"}
{"text":"A group of us arrived with a good 2 hours to spare to eat a meal and enjoy a couple of beers before seeing a comedy show at the playhouse down the street. When we walked in there was barely anyone there, and we ordered the sauerkraut balls, which were great! They we put our orders in about 20 minutes later and never got our food before it was time to go to the show. It started to get busy, but we put in our orders way before the crowd. We had to tell them never mind on our food because were were cutting it close to see our show. The server said that he was very sorry and that the beers were on the house. Then he came back and said that the manager said no to the beers on the house. So we all sat there for 2 hours with 2 beers each and an appetizer with no dinner. Probably won't go back anytime soon, unless I go right when they open. Maybe it was a bad day, or lack of staff, but they need to get their time management straight."}
{"text":"Yes please! We visited recently and were pleasantly surprised at the amazing staff and atmosphere. The appetizer sampler was amazing!"}
{"text":"I will echo a lot of the other reviews.  Don't come here to eat but the group party atmosphere is awesome.  I visited with a group of 12, my sister and I split the Beef Stroganoff and were the only people happy with our food.  Everything else was called bland/flavorless.  However, the ginormous beers and the lively polka/party song band (Sweet Caroline, Margaritaville, Sloopy) really had the whole place going."}
{"text":"Very nice and different luved it. Stopped by for a quick bite after a show at playhouse square and ended up dancing on the chairs. The live band added to the ambience. Luved the nice atmosphere and everyone was in a party mood. There was adequate security which raised our comfort level. The wine and beer selections were great. The food was perfect. Special thanks to Cassie for taking great care of us. Would definately come back. Highly recommend this place. 
Thx 
DR MD"}
{"text":"This place is a genuine german experience.  Good food, music, and service.  Can't wait to go back and grab a liter of beer and some good food I can't pronounce"}
{"text":"Place is a fantastic place to have a great time.  Good was good but a little over priced.  Traditional German fare.  The attraction though is the drinking and overall environment   Reminiscent of a German beer hall complete with live music the crowd was rowdy and immediately felt like family.  If anything else you visuals visit just for the experience"}
{"text":"This was an interesting visit as we have been meaning to visit this or the Pittsburgh location for months. Little did we know we were walking into a experience so unique words can't describe what witnessed. We thought it was a casual german restaurant, where we would get a post soccer meal. We waited for a bit while we could get a table, yes a real table sitting on benches with others. It was packed around 915pm, but was told it would get even busier and was usually busier. During the summer they sit outside on benches and have a huge patio, I can tell it would get crazy. So while we waited we noticed the staff dressed up in German attire and delivering beverages to crazy adults frequently. 

Around 10pm a band played, and it turned into people dancing on the bench's where we sat with their beverages. Not just a few, almost the entire place turned into a party dancing, forming conga lines, it was amazing. I haven't had this much fun in along time, Jennifer and our friend Brian also were blown away. everyone singing, partying and dancing. Bringing everyone together to have fun. 

Now onto the food our huge pretzel was good, and the dipping sauces were amazing. Two versions of mustard, and a cheese spread. The drinks Jenn and Brian got also were brewed well and huge, personally I got a diet coke. That was a disappointment as they stated they had coke zero on their menu. 

I got the sausage platter which gave me options of two types of sausage one resembling a breakfast sausage and one closer to a brautwurst they were good. I didn't care for the mashed potatoes or sauerkraut but I don't ever care for them. Jennifer liked them. She got a beef stroganoff that I thought was good and I don't eat that usually either. Brian liked his meal that was a pork chop dipped and breaded. I got a german chocolate cake, that was tasty, but overpriced. They got apple streusel with ice cream that was good, but again overpriced for portion size.

Overall we spent close to 90 dollars, and didn't care as the atmosphere was amazing and we look forward to going back again hopefully with more people. Solid food, but not amazing food."}
{"text":"One of the coolest restaurants I've been to. Great food and albeit pricy, I think it's worth it. The giant pretzel's name holds no secrets - it's massive, and the beer cheese dip is heavenly paired with it. I have no clue why this place has such bad ratings, every part of the experience was great! Definitely give this place a chance :)"}
{"text":"Called ahead on Easter, and was told that the restaurant would be open until 9:30pm. When I arrived at 7:30pm, I was informed that the restaurant was closing at 8 and was no longer serving food.  Very frustrating if you're visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the schnitzel and polka dancing! You can't just sit at your table in the beer hall, so stand up and sing along with the band! Our server Harold was phenomenal and kept the fun rolling!"}
{"text":"This place is the Disneyland of beer.

You wait in line outside with rope dividers and contemplate buying the souvenirs/paraphenalia. They play \"German\" music out over the loud speakers and when you get inside, people are wearing these costumes like \"it's a small world\" in Orlando FL!

There's a word in Mandarin that captures what the mood is here and I don't know how to explain it in English. \"Cuo re nao\" means \"join the fun\" and connotes a lively atmosphere where everyone is participating in the craziness! That's exactly what Hofbrauhaus is. Come here for the environment - it's loud, entertaining, and everyone from kid to grandma gets involved in the fun.

In order to get a group in, you'll most likely have to make a reservation - and do it weeks or months ahead of time! To squeeze in a party of 12-16, I called two months ahead for a Saturday 5pm seating. Weekends are nuts - people are standing up doing shot skis, the band  is singing german-y birthday songs every other minute and grandma is drinking beer.

During the week, it can be pretty slow so check it out then! I've had the wiener schnitzel (not worth it - can't after I've had the real deal) but the white sausage dishes are great and the currywurst is my FAVORITE!

PROST!"}
{"text":"After three trips I can say I am extremely disappointed by the wait staff and management. Rules regarding reservations are extremely inconsistent. Wait staff were very rude even during the day when there were almost no other customers. For instance, we visited on a friday evening and waited several hours to get in. The customers were standing on their chairs, dancing, pounding glasses on tables, and doing shot skis while standing on the tables. We visited less than two weeks later during lunch and were very rudely  asked to leave for tapping our glasses on the tables to the live music being played. We left and swore to never go back. The beer is great, the food is mediocre, and the management and wait staff are extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"I made reservations. Walking in, no one knows what's going on. The place I  made reservations for was closed. Okay. 
So we sit in main hall. After we stand there for 5 min., \"oh you seat yourself\" okay, I told the girl it was our first time. Didn't know that. Were greeted by 2 different waitresses, no one knows who's table is who's- but they do know a lot about the beer! 
Good beer. 
Got Cleveland restaurant week special. $50 for an app, 2 dinners and 2 desserts.  
Apps were all fried, they were ok. Dinner was amazing. Pot roast and the sausage sampler. Dessert was not very good. Apple strudel was not very sweet and kinda burnt, cream puff was better than strudel but not incredible. 
The lady who ended up being our server was super great. Over all a good night. Pot roast saved the evening!"}
{"text":"My first recommendation is to arrive early if you don't want wait hours in line. Part of our group arrived 3:30 to start grabbing tables, because a group of 20 is not big enough to warrant a reservation. 

So we started with one server and it took 20 minutes to get 2 beers and 3 pops. (Side note: something is off with their coke don't order it) A little while later our apps arrived. The fries tasted stale and old. The pretzels with beer cheese were great!

Flash forward two hours and half our table does not have its food. I haven't gotten a single drink refill. The manager comes over, comps the one check that is missing its food. 20 minutes more and I never received my food and I was still charged for it. 

In the end we spent four hours in HB, half of our food was missing or wrong, all of it was mediocre, and unless you are ordering alcohol your drink.won't be refilled. The final straw is that in order to get your valet discount you must tuen in your signed receipt to the valet - get a freaking stamp. 

I don't enjoy complaining, especially when I want to love a place. They earn 2 stars for great atmosphere and music. Otherwise its a hot mess, you get charged for items you never receive, and so not worth the $$."}
{"text":"First time at a Hofbr√§uhaus, and overall I was pleased. I'm not a big \"German food\" junkie or beer drinker so eating/drinking was subpar for me. But I love love LOVE the environment! So much fun dancing on the seats! If I ever go again, I must do a \"shot ski\"!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation, didn't realize I didn't confirm it. Still took my group immediately. Amazing server I can't remember her name but she was great. Fast and great service!"}
{"text":"Walking in to this place was like walking in to a huge, loud, wonderful party!  Admittedly, the wait to get in was long and kind of chilly, but there was a concession stand with beer, bakery, and snacks to get you through.  We ended up waiting about an hour and a half to be seated and maybe eventually reservations will make sense, but I completely understand why they aren't offered now; it's too hard to know when tables will be available because once you get in, you don't want to leave!

There were people dancing to the live polka music on the benches, shotskis getting delivered to tables left and right, and an all-around party atmosphere that I adored!  The beer and food are actually good too which was a pleasant surprise... I had assumed that you pay for the atmosphere and the experience and the food is an afterthought but that isn't the case at all! I had pierogies which were served with kielbasa, and the Polish girl in me was really pleased.  

The service is good too... We never had to ask for anything twice even though I can imagine that the noise level makes it extremely difficult to hear orders. Overall, this is the kind of place Cleveland needs... A fun dining experience that all ages can enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The pretzels are a great appetizer. We always get both cheese dips that go with the pretzels. The octoberfest beer is a traditional beer and not fall tasting like you would think."}
{"text":"This place has it all! Great food, great music, great seating/atmosphere, of course amazing beer. When the weather is great, you must take advantage of the beer garden patio and even if there is rain or snow, the large communal dining hall is so much fun as the bands play all kinds of traditional European folk songs as well as simple jingles that every American can relate to from some part of your life. You can partake in the full liter beer stein swaying and \"clanking\" or you can easily just watch and enjoy the incredible song and dance from your seat. All of the staff is happy to help you with the creative menu and teach you any lyrics to songs and even dances if you like. This place can be tailored for any occasion. I have been for a wild social outing, an evening dinner, and even a 90th birthday party.... This place can accommodate anyone! As a carnivore, I delved into a big juicy pork shank that had buttery crispy skin that absolutely blended with my seasonal specialty beer. They also have a full bar for non beer drinkers. Others in my group loved the breaded chicken cutlet smothered in mushroom gravy (they have various \"toppings\" for this dish) and you MUST try the potato and cheese pierogies and the warm pretzels with beer cheese!! I could go on and on but just make sure you give this place a chance and let the good times roll. You won't find many dining experiences like this I guarantee it. Note, for a calmer dining experience (still with some great music of course) go during lunch or early evenings. The \"full\" Oktoberfest atmosphere can be enjoyed on Friday and Saturday nights. I will be back !!!"}
{"text":"We went here Thurs.1/24 and it was our first time. The Hostess greeted me in German attire and took me to a large picnic style table.  Picnic style table also means you share with other people.  Luckily, we were seated on a end and the other people at the table were men who could help move the table so I could be seated.  I had to ask the gentlemen at the table to help move the table so I could get out and go to the Ladies room. The LIVE band, dressed in Lierderhosens, was fun and try to get the Guests to participate in singing and contests.  I met a few bandmembers and they were nice gentlemen.  We did try the Micro-brew beers.  I had a Lager, light in color, nice taste.  We split a Bavarian cheeseburger (hamburger and pork) with french fries.  The burger was good and the Brown Mustard on the table was good and went well with the beer.  We think the food prices were a little high. The ambience is the closest to Octoberfest that we've experienced.  Parking is $10:("}
{"text":"Fun place.  Good beer (they carry one they claim is based on the original Hofbrau recipe).  My smoked pork was OK-- a bit dry.  But the atmosphere was great with a lot of people and an um-pah-pah band.  Must be fun when the weather gets warmer and they open up the outside, too."}
{"text":"I loved the Hofbrauhaus great beer, great food, and great service. The Hofbrauhaus is a must stop if visiting Cleveland."}
{"text":"They really need to up their game to compare with the other Hofbrauhauses in the United States.  The food quality, with the exception of the imported pretzels was low.  The schnitzel was soggy and the spaetzel was crusty.  The beer was good (thank god), but they were so slow bringing it to us.  It was nearly 45 minutes to get the first liter and this is on a Monday night at a 1/3rd full restaurant.  The servers were just awful and slow.  They couldn't keep track of orders and didn't know what the food they were bringing out was.  It wasn't that they couldn't match the plates to the diner, but they couldn't say what the food they were carrying out was. The meals were also, often wrong.  I don't know if it was the kitchen's fault or the wait staff, but half the meals in our group had a problem.  And the service was just slow, slow, slow.  At least the beer was good."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! We took our entire family for my son's 17th birthday and it was entertaining for everyone including grandparents and a toddler! Great place to go with a group and celebrate a birthday! The band called The Casuals was so fun! People were standing and dancing. Service and food were excellent as well. This place will put you in the best mood."}
{"text":"Great place to go and have a drink with friends! However, it is extremely loud and I have had good and bad service when I have visited. Be sure to come early or you will have to wait in line!"}
{"text":"I never really write reviews, but I feel the management needs to hear about some of their kinks to work them out. 

The door situation is a major problem. People are not allowed to enter without their entire party-which I can understand, but why are you not allowed to wait at the bar like any other restaurant? There was a long line as we were leaving but plenty of seats inside. The door hosts are rude, a bit too controlling, and extremely stress inducing.  As I was leaving I was waiting by the front door for my friends to be done in the bathroom, dancing. It's hard not to dance in there! The manager snapped at me, \"Excuse me, did you wait in line?\" I replied that I was waiting for my friends to return from the bathroom. He replied with a sneer, \"The bathrooms are over there-and pointed.\" I just kind of looked at him and kept dancing by the door. Then he turned to a group of women and asked them if I was with them. I'm sorry but this is not how you treat a guest that has just spent 120 dollars in your restaurant. I was doing nothing wrong. 

I have been to the Hofbr√§uhaus in Pittsburgh and had a completely different experience with the door hosts. There were 4 of us and we were allowed to huddle around 2 bar seats. It was much more pleasant and they weren't nasty or controlling.

Other than the door problems, the atmosphere is super fun and the service was great. Our food was great and the band was so entertaining."}
{"text":"I haven't even gotten there yet. I called to find out Sunday brunch/lunch info. Older lady ( German ) picked up phone and I proceeded to ask her about Sunday offerings as I have 2 disabled comming with and party of 20, didn't wNt to drive around town and personally web site gave No  info. These ladies cannot sit on benches. Anyway she said hold on I have customers then proceed to yell\" can I help you\"? Over and over again till I finally hung up. I'm in customer service at a restaurant. I was her customer . Very disappointed in web site and helga the phone nazi. She was not nice so I'm not."}
{"text":"Growing up in Germany with the hofbrauhaus an hour away spoiled me. The one in Vegas has the feel of a mini-haus. The one in Cleveland disappointed me. The food was what I expected solid german food. Walking in I noticed no paintings over head. A complete lack of knowledge from the waitstaff when I asked for some german mustard. All I got was fancy yellow. I only heard one german accent while there, all the waitstaff were introduced to him as Maximillian. All in all there are better german places but still none better than the history Hofbrau holds. That is why 3 stars and not 2"}
{"text":"Each time I go to the Hafbrauhaus I want to love it but the food is so very disappointing. Each and every time! Maybe someone needs to tell them that they are in an ethnic part of country where excellent German food is so easy to get for a WAAAY better value. I can say the pretzels are good. I wont be eating ever again there except the pretzels.  Second, trying to call and make a reservation is soooo difficult. You have to leave a message cause no one answers the phone! No reservation for a party over 20?!?? Amazing! Don't you want to know and plan for the fact we are coming? Reservation or not? Customer service by the hosts can be approved upon greatly. What the Hofbrauhus is fantastic at is providing good atmosphere by the fun Local Cleveland polka bands that we enjoy during Oktoberfest season and now can enjoy all year round! Fred Z. Probably could talk less when the place is full. You cant hear him. So if you want fun, beer, pretzels and great Cleveland polka music during the winter it is excellent place! Seriously,  the food needs lots of help. One star for Cleveland Polka music, one for great German beer and shotskiz's, and one for pretzels!"}
{"text":"My friends took me to Hofbrauhaus Cleveland for my birthday. We were a group of ten and everyone had a great time and enjoyed the food, beer, and atmosphere. We ordered the pretzel with beer cheese, sauerkraut balls, schnitzel with ham and bier cheese, reuben, and potato soup. Everything was great. Everyone was happy. We were up dancing on the benches or even in the aisle. The balance between music, dancing, and music breaks to chat was spot on. People of all ages seemed to have a blast. Thanks for a great birthday celebration, Hofbrauhaus Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Good - Wait time on a Sunday evening , seating area, patio, location, service, atmosphere, beer
Average - chicken dishes, onion rings and sausage. Definitely had better
Bad- One server who threw the menus on table when we entered and did not make us feel welcome at all. I think if that didnt happen, I would had an overall good experience. 

Will give it another try, another day"}
{"text":"This was my first time at Hofbr√§uhaus Cleveland, but I have been to the original Hofbr√§uhaus in M√ºnchen. Overall this visit was a pleasant experience. We sat in the beer hall at lunchtime so it wasn't rowdy as one reviewer complained about. With that said, if you are sitting in the beer hall then be prepared for a rowdy boisterous crowd. That is the intended experience. People go there for a fun time, this includes people dancing in the table. The food was good and filling. I ordered an Oktoberfest pretzel. It was similar in size to the pretzels I have eaten at various fests in Bavaria, but it lacked the crispy flakiness that makes a true fest pretzel. The ham sandwich was quite tasty and people in my party complemented their w√ºrst plates. And of course the beer was great. It is nice to have a fresh German beer. 

I will definitely make repeat visits."}
{"text":"14 of us came for one of our grand daughters BD 6-18-18, for the second year in a row... Sorry to say the waitress was the most impersonable person who gave us the impression she was doing us a big favor by being there... Many of us were disappointed in the food, dry and overcooked..
I know they have always had a great reputation, but I can't say it was a VG experience this time..."}
{"text":"Yum. Delicious food. Great service and s fun time. I had the special schnitzel with bier cheese and ham and it was awesome. And they have a monthly beer that is tapped. I also recommend the sour kraut balls. Delicious meal."}
{"text":"Very unique building. Fun to walk around. Nice atmosphere. Freindly people. Beers ok. Food and drink over priced. 7.50$ for a 1/2 liter with 1 inch head. Worth a best and out."}
{"text":"The only good thing i have to say about this place is the band is good and energetic. The food was nasty the liquor we were given was watered down. The staff and manager were rude and not accomodating. The worst part of our experience was the end of the night. After spending $300 between four people. I went outside to answer a phone call, and my girlfriend went to the restroom. I guess they thought we were leaving but we were not. The security then told us we must leave the restaurant but we were not ready to leave. He dragged out forcefully. We still do not understand why we were kicked out. There was no explanation, the security and the cop that was there had no explanation for us to leave. Once we began to question the reason we were being kicked out they began to embarass us in front of everyone. The security and cop pushed and grabbed my girlfriend, 2 friends and i out the restaurant. They pushed me down the stairs and grabbed my girlfriend by the hood of her jacket, because she was asking to speak to the manager. we were in complete shock, this is not normal and unheard of. The place is unprofessional, and out of control. I would not recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Meh* I've had better.  
The location is convenient and that's the reason we went there after a playhouse concert.  
The location is nice and I like how it's open and the atmosphere ,  but that's about where the love ends.  
The stables are hard to get in and out of as they are low seating long benches.  Took a while for service.  And the food is not good. Pretty bad when child won't eat her pizza cause it tastes bad,  and neither will you! 

Prices are steep as well."}
{"text":"You go to Hofbrauhaus for the atmosphere and the giant beers.  If you recognize that, and realize that everything else is secondary, you should have a good time.

We went with a group of friends to celebrate the end of the academic year, and had a lot of fun.  Yes, it's loud. Yes, it's super crowded.  Yes, it's disproportionately expensive.  But where else will a band alternate playing traditional Bavarian music with Jimmy Buffet covers?  Where else will you stand on your seat with your friends while doing shots off of a shot-ski?  Where you will watch a bachelorette party and bachelor party challenge each other to a drinking contest?  And where else will give you an entire liter of beer in a German mug?

I will admit that, having appropriate expectations going in, I was pleasantly surprised by the food.  The giant pretzel is excellent.  My sauerbraten was delicious.  My husband liked the jagerschnitzel, and I heard good things from table-mates about the onion rings, pierogies and potato pancakes.  If you're a vegetarian or looking for something low-calorie... maybe get yourself a snack before you venture here.  Prices are high, but portions are huge, so this isn't where the rip-off is.  Their beer is quintessentially German, so don't go looking for anything exotically weird, but it tastes great, and is generally of low ABV as to allow you to drink liter-size units of it without being in any sort of dangerous.  Shots are a rip-off, but if you're going to spend the money for the experience of it, the German apple is tasty.

Other tidbits: reservations recommended.  Also, they have valet parking but it's expensive, and let's face it, unless you have a friend willing to DD, you should probably Uber here anyway (see above re: giant beers).

Not a great deal, and not the greatest of food, but if you're looking to have a fun night with a group of friends, it's a great place for it."}
{"text":"Would you like the pork, the pork, or the pork? Their menu is a smorgasbord of pork... which is just fine by me! Was very excited to try this place. Came here late on a Wednesday night after the 2015 Yelpy Awards. Place was nearly empty -  though not unusual for 10PM on a weeknight. The German band just got done performing when we got seated, so that kinda sucked! Tried the Jaegerschnitzel and the Schweinsbraten for dinner with their seasonal red lager. I think I just had slight over expectations and forgot that this is an international chain. Don't get me wrong - I cleaned up my plate, and the food was pretty good; it was tasty, but not greasy. The portions were huge. It just wasn't great. One of us requested \"no salt\" on one of the dishes and was denied because their dishes and sauces are all \"prepped and pre-made in the morning\". Prices were in the upper teens, but I guess one can't complain too much because you do get a lot of food. Service was on par. Call me spoiled, I've been to Germany where schnitzel is street food. But for true schnitzel fans, check out my other reviews to find where I think the heavenliest \"sanctuarian\" schnitzel dish (imo) in CLE resides. Overall, I enjoyed the food enough to want to come back. Plus, I'd like to experience the place while it's hopping, loud with music and people having fun! While enjoying our meal, we witnessed a group at another table hop up on their table and suck down a shot ski. How cool! I'd come back just for that!"}
{"text":"Boy we loved this place, really great food, and the band playing was really good but really loud. Try and sit in the back if you have kids. its hard to talk since its so loud."}
{"text":"A Horrible Place
This is by far the worst Hofbrauhaus I have ever been to in my life. The young women at the check in counter was rude and standoffish. The waitress we encountered was crude, laud and obnoxious. The food was over cooked, over salted and tasted like rubber. The restaurant itself is very laud and the only thing they care about is to turn over as many tables as possible. Amanda, one of the managers is a useless moronic know it all arrogant maggot who has no idea what hospitality means. 
STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS - It is a NIGHTMARE!!!"}
{"text":"Before the theater in a Tuesday night, This was a great choice.   Thank you Cindy when we called in. We met friends and had a good time. The duo on music was fun. Food was as expected. Server was ok. Will go again, but food is pretty heavy share share share. The sauerkraut balls are really small why oh why??"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends after seeing the Blue Man Group. There was a line to get into the restaurant, which was to be expected.
Once we got seated, it was interesting. This place is like a giant cafeteria. It took forever for our waitress to come around and get our orders, but the food was good.
The most interesting thing we saw was they had this thing that looked like a ski that had 4 shots in it. They would hand it to whoever ordered it, and encourage people to stand up on the benches and have all 4 of them take the shot at once by lifting the ski. 
They did have a live music, but the guy playing seemed to repeat the same songs over and over."}
{"text":"There are so many great places in Northeast Ohio that do German food right (Der Braumeister, Das Schnitzel Haus, Bier Haus, to name just a few) that it seems almost a shame to visit a national chain like Hofbrauhaus. I suppose it was more curiosity than anything else that brought us in. We'd read and heard so much about this recent addition to the theater district that we just couldn't help ourselves.

Our visit was sometime around 6:30 on a Tuesday evening. We'd expected parking to be a bit of a challenge, but we managed to find a free street spot down a snow-covered side street within walking distance. We walked in, were immediately greeted and escorted to our seats at the end of one of the long communal benches lining the giant, open main dining hall.

To describe Hofbrauhaus, that's not too difficult. It's sort of like the Walt Disney World of German restaurants. Very manufactured. It has all of the things you'd expect to see - copper brewing kettles, beer hall tables, giant light fixtures, polka band, girls dressed like Swiss Miss, guys wearing lederhosen, it feels like you're in Epcot Center. There are even \"Pretzel Girls\" walking around with baskets hung around their necks. They never came over to our side of the table, so I'm not sure what that was all about.

It's very loud, not too warm in the winter (seats by the large, single-paned glass windows should be avoided) and did I mention loud? With nothing to dampen the crowd noise the reverberation is deafening. The live music isn't a bad thing, and they do take breaks, but having a conversation in this place isn't recommended unless you brought along a bag of lozenges.

In general, they're expensive, too, but it's downtown pricing, so not unexpected. The beer pricing is actually very reasonable. A liter (33.8oz) of beer will set you back $10.99 and a half liter (roughly a pint), $5.99. Add a buck to these prices for a seasonal beer. Speaking of the beer, it's all quite sweet, very low-alcohol German style beer. No surprises. Average price for an entree? Somewhere around $16.

But what about the service? I know you're probably wondering about that, right?

This is where things went downhill.

Apparently, no one ever told the servers that we were seated so we waited. And waited. And waited. When it finally hit the 30 minute mark, my wife flagged down a hostess that was seating another couple and told her we hadn't been helped. Another 10 minutes passes before a clearly exasperated server makes his way to our table and takes our drink orders. Finally, we thought, things were moving along.

We were wrong.

Our drinks were quickly dropped off who continued on to somewhere else and we continued to sit and wait, sipping our beer (one saving grace), while other parties, most of whom had arrived way after we did, were seated and received their drinks and food. At nearly 45 minutes gone, we had still not placed our dinner order.

I can understand a longer-than-normal wait time during a peak dining time on a Friday or Saturday evening, but Tuesday? Just when we were on the cusp of finishing our beers and walking out, our server reappeared. We placed our orders then waited some more. 20 more minutes pass before our food - all of the food we ordered, there was no staggering of appetizer and entree - was brought to our table.

The giant Okoberfest pretzel with beer cheese dip was pretty good. While nowhere close to the one at the Fat Head's Brewery Taproom, it was delicious. My wife had the soup of the day, some kind of tomato/eggplant concoction, and it tasted exactly like a bowl of oversalted marinara sauce.

The Wurstplatte, a showcase of tubular, cased meats, was delicious. The frankfurter, chicken sausage and bratwurst were served with sides of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. They were fresh, seasoned very well and satisfied my meat craving quite nicely. My wife was less impressed with the Bavarian Chef Salat. What makes it \"Bavarian\"? I guess because they say it has \"Swiss cheese and Bavarian ham\". A decent salad, sure, but at $16, I would have expected more than this.

Gotta give our server credit, even after the less-than-stellar showing that we were given during our first visit, he had the cajones to ask if we wanted dessert. No, thanks, man, we don't feel like waiting around for another hour. Were we compensated in any way for the bad service and long waits? Nope. Actually, we weren't given any incentive to come back.

Let's try to summarize. 
Incredibly long wait. Spotty service. Decent German food and beer. Loud. I'd say that sums it up.

One and done. We have no reason to return. Like I said, Cleveland is full of small, locally-owned German restaurants. We'll go there instead."}
{"text":"Rude and dishonest! First off, there was a long line and the hostess was so rude! She wouldn't seat people unless the whole party was there. Some lady in line said her friend had reservations and she was told that they wouldn't honor reservations! We had a party of 7 and, since we drove seperately, 3 arrived first: the hostess told us she \"didn't understand\" why we were here, yet refused to sit us without the rest of our party. They insist on stamping your hand to get in for some reason. When our check came, everybody threw in money. We counted it and there was enough for tip. Then when we got up to leave a bit later, the waitress said we were $60 short! Don't know who pocketed our money but sure as heck won't be back!"}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus boasts a fun and boisterous atmosphere but the food falls flat.

My friends and I had an excellent night out at Hofbrau. We loved the live music, huge beers, and rowdy crowd. However, as a self-professed Polish Pierogi Queen, I was not impressed by the food. My pierogis were mushy and the accompanying mettwurst was mediocre.

On a bright note, the desserts (the cream puff, in particular) were tres yummy.

I'll definitely come back for the drink scene and fun atmosphere but I'll make sure to hit up the Pierogi Palace at the WSM beforehand."}
{"text":"WORST EXPERIENCE AND SERVICE EVER! I consider myself to be patient and understanding, but seriously... Avoid this place at all costs. Our service was slow and the place wasn't busy at all. Our server had an open cut on her finger and was licking it during our entire service! Our food came out cold, and it was hard to get a beer. The beer was great though. The manager, Laura, did come over and do her best to make it right though and that impressed me. We didn't pay a bill, but it would have been great to have a good experience here"}
{"text":"The first Hofbrauhaus I went to was in Pittsburgh and I had a blast! A few years ago, I was very excited to hear that Cleveland will be getting one. 

During the first few weeks of opening, I was probably there 2-3 times a week!
The atmosphere here is a lot of fun. Very happy beer drinkers and lots of dancing!
I like the big benches and communal seating. It became busier during the winter months and the wait was over an hour in some cases. Took a hiatus from this place until recently.

There are usually half a dozen different brews on tap. My usual go to is the Dunkel... and of course, in the liter size! The Dunkel is a bit darker than their lager but it's still very smooth and easy to drink. The Octoberfest (seasonal) was also quite good with a golden color and white froth brewed with a bit of spice. 

Their food is quite good as well. I've had their pork shoulder and fish and chips. The shoulder was very tasty and tender and was massive! I wish they still have the pork shoulders on the menu, it was part of their trial items during their opening weeks. Fish and chips were crispy, flaky, and juicy. They were made with walleye filets. 

A good night here usually consists of 2+ liters of beer and some dancing on the benches!"}
{"text":"What a fun experience! The entertainment, delicious food, and fun atmosphere. We will definitely be back! Very friendly and welcoming to their guests! Not to mention the amazing dessert!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Lots of energy. Too much food all the portions are HUGE.   Right now everyone in the place is singing \"Sweet Caroline\". Awesome!!"}
{"text":"Neat location.  Great German food.  But you must LOVE beer.

I recommend this for group events.  They have a nice room for 40 people or so.  

Go on a Monday and see the comedy show.  Best team building event in a long while!"}
{"text":"NO ability to rate but yelp forces a star so here's 1.  A large group of our family MADE RESERVATIONS for dinner next week several months ago. We were eagerly anticipating our evening together at a great new Cleveland venue when we received a SHOCKING call telling us that they have decided NOT to take reservations NOR to honor those they had already made! They said it would be \"first come first served,\" which is ridiculous for a group this size on a Friday night. Most of us have worked in hospitality in the past and are therefore pretty forgiving and generous. This, however, is just terrible customer service. Fortunately we were able to get reservations at a longtime favorite so we will have our party, but this is JUST BAD SERVICE! Hope this place gets it together...in spite of a perfect location, they can't insult Clevelanders for long and hope to survive."}
{"text":"Having so much fun......4 stars because food is not great.....good, but I can whip it up at home. If you want atmosphere, music, large amounts of beer, this is worth a stop. Not a boring place. Thought the first band was the end, but low and behold, another band set up. Again, saurkraut balls, delicious.....entree, average at best.....BUT, not boring so it's worth it if you need to wake up lol."}
{"text":"I've been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, and it was a blast. but, as Germans are wont to do, there were plans for expansion! the one in Manhattan is predictably crowded with annoying people; I've been there a handful of times and try to avoid it. however, the one in Cleveland attracts an older and more chill crowd.

shotskis - oh, screw it, we were taking Uber anyway, let's do this! all the choices for the shotskis (4 shot glasses snugly fit into a fixture on a ski) are kinda fruity and not really my type of booze, but my cousins and I had a blast anyway.

the beer is great, as expected. the food left a bit to be desired - the pretzel was okay, but the veal wurst and spaetzle were good. portion sizes were a bit of a downer, too.

not too packed when we got there on a Friday night, but it was filling up when we staggered on out around 9. service was fast and attentive, and we were never without a fresh stein of beer for long. for a Cleveland bar, it's a little costly, though."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner with my Wife and Daughter on 2/21/2015 after attending an event at the Cleveland Convention Center. Our waiter Mark was outstanding. The food was some of the best German food I have ever eaten and being German, I have eaten plenty. The only complaint is because of the city of Cleveland. Your lack of free parking on the weekends and failure to plow the streets is embarrassing and you should be ashamed. (Ask the city of Philadelphia for advice on this. We lived there for 38 years). One more complaint, the parking garage where we park IMG Parking on Saint Claire, was affordable ($16 for all day). However, it was like you were driving through a department store. The burst pipe that was flooding the 3rd level was a nice touch. When we advised the \"attendant\" of the burst pipe, he said \"i told them about it and they just don't care\"."}
{"text":"I had a good lunch experience here.  I ordered a dish that I have never had before (wurst schnitzel), but I was delightfully surprised.  The taste was great, and at a lunch menu price of eight dollars, it was a bargain.  It was a business lunch, so I was unable to partake in the libations.  My large party was met by both the manager, and owner with great conversation and smiles.   This is definitely a spot that I would visit in the future. 

Btw-  according to the owner, they will be starting a happy hour beginning next week."}
{"text":"I'll keep the rating the same even though my entree was ok. I got the Swiss cheese noodles.  Big portion with a side salad.  I appreciated the Swiss taste and the onions but it felt clumpy and not very fresh.  The large pretzel was delicious. Warm soft and three different dips. Watch out for the mustard. It'll clear your sinuses!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. I've come with groups and I've come as a pair. I've been here really late, and I've been here as early as 6pm. What I really enjoy, is that regardless of the companionship - you're bound to have a good time every time you come. It feels so cliche to say that the slap-happy music gets you goin', but it really does. You can't help but just forget your cares and enjoy life here!

So, firstly, definitely go for the music. Secondly, go for the food. You'd be crazy not to! Every time I've been here, it's been consistent. The monster soft pretzels come out warm and soft, the schnitzel is finely breaded and crunchy, sausages are yummy, OH!... and I almost forgot!-- The fried onion rings are ridiculous in all of the very best ways. As long as you enjoy German food, (or maybe EVEN if you don't) you're bound to find something delicious. The menu is extensive and prices may seem high upon first appearance... but the portions are gigantamo. Seriously. 

Thirdly. Beer. Beer. Beer. Don't be a crazy-ass and get a shorty. Just do yourself a favor and get the huge mug. Do everyone else around you a favor, and get the huge mug. And then... Thank me later.  ;-)

The waiting line is never a problem. I've heard horror stories that this place doesn't seat quickly. I've quite possibly been here five times in all and I've NEVER had to wait long. Ten minutes at the most. Please don't let that deter you from enjoying yourself. Be patient and kind and recognize that this place packs a huge amount of people. You're going to have a great time!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town. Didn't realize the atmosphere we were walking into with my 11 year old daughter. No one asked us if we were eating of just there to drink. Could not tell us how long the wait was either. When we were finally given a seat it was smack in the middle of an incredibly loud room of drunks. I asked to be sat on the other side of the restaurant. I was told it was closed so I asked about outside. The wait staff was very busy. Then didn't check on us. We sat on the rain on the deck waiting for her to come with our check. The waitress was accommodating and very nice."}
{"text":"Lively, super fun atmosphere & great customer service!!

Went here with my family to celebrate graduation and could not have chosen a better place to go to celebrate. So much fun! Our waiter and the rest of the staff were very friendly & they made an effort to give me a \"Congrats\" shoutout on the mic for graduation.

Great time! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Great service, only reason for 2 stars! They did not offer the best menu item during the week...been to a few HofBrauhaus's, only one that does not serve Schweinshaxen during the week....music was way to loud....overbearing....I sat in front of the band in Munich and could still carry on a conversation....a disgrace to the name!"}
{"text":"This is Daddy's Happy Place! I've only been to this one twice now but have been to the Columbus one nearly 20 times. German Food is my absolute favorite and Hofbrauhaus never disappoints. I normally split a sampler plate with someone but this time I got a burger and loved it! I also tried the Reuben and that corn beef was the best corn beef I've ever had. The Stroganoff was equally amazing! The pretzels with beer cheese is good and the Maybach was delicious!! Joe also made our experience that much better!

Update: hate to do this but had to drop a star because one of the reasons I love the Columbus Hofbrauhaus is for the Creme Puffs! I ordered 2 Vanilla from here to go for the next day and they were HORRIBLE! Seemed like they shot them full of a nasty whip creme. Not vanilla and wasn't even a good tasting creme of any kind... not sure what happened there, but we literally threw them away."}
{"text":"This is not the restaurant you go to if you want a quick meal and head elsewhere; this is a destination. This is where you plop down and stay the whole night. Between the live band, the cold liters of beer (brewed right behind the bar), and the AMAZING (repeat: AMAZING!) food, you won't want to go anywhere else. 
I have been here multiple times and every time, both upstairs and on the main floor, the bands managed to energize the room and get everyone on their feet. They play both traditional old world songs as well as modern classics to get everyone singing along. Sweet Caroline, Hang on Sloopy, you know the drill. By the end of the night, half the restaurant was marching around doing a conga line while the other half cheered and high-fived. 
The beer selection is relatively small, but is made up for by the fact that it's brewed right there by master brewers and you get it in either half-liter or liter glasses. My favorite is the light lager, which resembles bud light but about 100x more flavorful. They have a selection of other alcoholic beverages, like the Arnold Palmer, for non beer enthusiasts. They also have the famous shot skis, a wooden ski with 4 holders for shots of your choosing. Though you can get less than 4 if you have a smaller group, getting the full 4 is a great way to get to know the people sitting next to you. 
Food-wise, there's really not much to say that hasn't been said. Every dish I've had has been 5 star quality. My favorite dish is probably the jagershnitzel. I would also recommend the fried pickles appetizer because they use whole spears instead of pickle chips like you normally see. 
Overall, it's just a fantastic experience."}
{"text":"Maybe we should try again. The night we were there, let's just say first impressions were very bad. German potato salad was the worst and sauerbraten was nothing more than roast beef. The schnitzel was subpar. The best part of the night was the potato cakes and the beer. We will try again and hope to have a better experience. We had a very good experience at the Vegas location."}
{"text":"I love German and polish food but an hour wait after ordering is unacceptable, especially when someone orders the same plate 20 minutes after you and gets it 20 minutes before you. Additionally when they finally brought the food (everyone else's was cold because they politely waited) it was scarcely comparable to the plate served to the patron next to us. Even when being super polite to the server in mentioning the vast contrast in wait time and amount of food (1 slice of bratwurst served to us when the plate for the patron next to us had roughly 15) the only response aside from assurance that \"it wouldn't have happened if the server was back there\" was to wait yet again for the bratwurst slices to come. Not to mention the plate of piergoies with 1 piece of bratwurst comes at a whopping $16. If you've got time and money to waste this is the place."}
{"text":"Ugh, I really wanted to love Hofbrauhaus and was super excited to try it out.  Sadly, it was almost the worst service I've ever experienced.  I was with a party of four. We had reservations so we were seated right away, no issues there. After being seated, we waited and waited for water, a sign of a server, or a drink order.  Finally after almost a half hour, we asked the hostess who said she would get someone over, no one came. Ten minutes later, we grabbed a passing server who also said she would get someone over to our table.  She came back and said our server hadn't arrived at work yet so she would take our table. The other half of our table had a server, as did all the surrounding tables so how our group of four with a reservation didn't have a server, was a mystery. 

After we were served our food I asked for the manager to let her know we waited 45 minutes for our first drink.  She was apathetic at best, and just repeated over and over \"People called off, it happens, sorry.\"  A sincere apology would have been acceptable but it's really poor customer service to basically say, \"too bad, people called off what do you want me to do?\"  If servers called off it's understandable but how was every single table around us getting drinks immediately after being seated.......made no sense.  At least act like you care about your customers. 

We pretty much panicked and ordered since we had no clue how long it would be before someone came back to our table. The food wasn't anything amazing but wasn't bad either.   There are lots of excellent German restaurants in Cleveland with way better food and great service.  This place is a good party/drinking place if that's what you're looking for.  Don't come here for the food or service though, you'll be let down."}
{"text":"Delicious squash soup and great sauerkraut balls. I would call this organized chaos. Very fun for beer drinkers who want to get rowdy. The place has been packed every time I go and super loud. Usually they have a love band so it's pretty fun for a weekend night. I wouldn't recommend this place for families though."}
{"text":"I made a reservation for 16 people several weeks in advance for my bachelor party, and when we arrived the manager refused to honor the reservation. He was rude to myself and the rest of my party. I will never be giving this or any other Hofbrauhaus my business again."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place because everyone told me what a good time it was. It wasn't super hard to find, but parking was kind of annoying/expensive. We made reservations for 9:30 and when we checked in, they had told us to wait in line. After 30 minutes of waiting, we were finally escorted to our table. There was a band playing, people dancing on tables, and singing. It seemed fun. Our not so friendly waiter didn't come to get our drink order until like 10 minutes after we had sat down. He didn't ask if we wanted another beer or to order food while we were waiting for the rest of our party to get there. I ordered the Pierogis and Mettwurst, which was actually pretty good. The bill for 2 ended up being $63, this place is super expensive. Not sure if I'd go back because of the service I received there."}
{"text":"Let me just say up front that this is a unique review because I did not eat or drink here. I came for a comedy show put on by Accidental Comedy Club. This was my first visit to Hofbr√§uhaus and it seems really big, plenty of seating and a stage upstairs for shows. That was a great space. The Hofbr√§uhaus was awesome to take on these shows when Reddstone closed a few months ago. The comedy was great and the few staff I spoke to or observed were doing a great job. Thanks for having this space for local comedy Hofbr√§uhaus!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Hofbrauhaus, so when I heard about the Happy Hour I stopped by.  Pretty quiet at 3pm, a couple tables scattered about but even so the place looks good.  A big room with a high ceiling, bar at one end and a small stage at the other.  During the day the room is filled with light and is inviting, if a bit vast.

Happy Hour allows half price on beers and appetizers, so that is what I ordered.  A half liter of wheat beer, is cool and smooth, nice and mellow makes it very drinkable.  

The apps platter had fried pickle spears, onion rings, potato pancakes and sauerkraut balls, since the sauerkraut balls have meat, I had them substitute a pretzel which they were nice enough to do.  The two huge onion rings were nice, with a crispy batter that slightly overpowered the onion inside.   I would have preferred more onion flavor, but overall pretty good.  The potato pancakes were very well done, crispy on the outside and nice and starchy on the inside.  Topped with the sour cream it was a very fine app.  I also really enjoyed the applesauce that came with the potato pancakes, diced apples lightly cooked so they still had a bit of crispness and just the right amount of sweetness.  The fried pickles were the highlight of the plate; large pickle spears are wrapped in a soft dough.  The pickles have a nice salty bite which contrasts well with the coating.  Dipped in the honey mustard sauce, the fried pickles taste great with the cold beer.  My only complaint with the pickles would be that they were a bit greasy.

The pretzel was a slightly disappointing, I was anticipating a really great pretzel and instead got a decent pretzel, but nothing memorable or exemplary as I would have hoped from a German beer hall.

Service by the bartender was friendly and prompt.  

Hofbrauhaus is a great place to get some fine German style beer and have a great time.  The food is nicely done, simple and straightforward, but don't come looking for cutting edge culinary innovations."}
{"text":"the fathers day brunch was ok, the food was not that great but not forrible either but the service was a bit off. We did wish they would have told us about being able to order from the menu but waiting so long for drink service was a bit annoying."}
{"text":"If you are interested in a quiet evening with friends, eating some good German food, drinking some good beer -- this is NOT the place for you to go.  If you are looking for some good to very good German food, good beer, and a rowdy (borderline obnoxious), loud evening with friends, this IS the place for you.  
It is modeled after German beer halls with long tables and benches with group seating.  Menu has basic German items.  The extra large pretzel is good, and certainly made to share.  The saurkraut balls were also well made.  The schnitzel was good to very good.  Sauerbraten is very good.  Service is a bit slow and sometimes edgy.  There are year round beer selections and one seasonal beer.  There is a full bar with wine and other alcoholic beverages.  We have not tried this in the summer, but look forward to trying outside dining."}
{"text":"I am so happy with this Hof Brau!  We have been to the original in Munich, the one in the park in Munich, the one in Cinci.  The atmosphere, food, beer, and spirit of the place is awesome!  I really am happy to get their beers. Yes, I love hoppy IPAs, but they are now cliche and I crave traditional, proven beers like these. To be able to enjoy two 1L beers is great. Just relax, eat, drink, laugh, smile. That's what it's all about."}
{"text":"The waitress was very rude, since we arrived, when ordering the food I asked more than three times the kids menu, food all I arrived in time less one of my friends, a waitress put food dishes in one corner for everyone to recognize his plate and take it annoyed when asked what was what. The waitress ignored us, we had to get up to fetch her, she was upset and asked us to return to our seat. when we asked for the bill we saw was charging more things. She was upset and did not care, and she call the police because she think we we're not going to pay. We just want to pay and leave, We are never coming back again."}
{"text":"Went before visit to the theatre with some friends.  I'd like to give it 3.5 stars. The food is average and the prices are above average . With so many options in Cleveland that offer phenomenal food for the same price it will be a while until we come back . If you want a great place to gather with friends and sing and get a little rowdy this is the place dancing on the benches is not frowned upon and can be a lot of fun .  So to summarize don't go for the food go for the atmosphere and the great memories you will have with your friends."}
{"text":"This place gets packed.  The food was decent. Better than what I though.  The service was efficient. 10 bucks for a liter of beer is a bit pricey. Share one that way it does not get warm.
The sour kraut balls were amazing. Pot roast was nice, walley had a bit to much breading. And the wiener schnitzel was good.  Most people could get away with sharing a meal."}
{"text":"I LOVE, love, love this place!!!! My mother, myself, and grandma always rave about this place especially my grandmother. It's refreshing to have a German restaurant in Cleveland finally. Unless we have some that I am unaware of and if so please share the location :) 


I suggest trying the schnitzel. It's a German staple. Growing up with a German grandmother has its perks :)....my only complaint is that sometimes they are heavy on the flour and there's more bread then meat but I am sure if you tell them light on the flour they will make it work. Depending on which day of the week you go they will have a live band. they have a nice selection of famous German beer but only the strong survive lol. I usually skip out on that part. btw, prepare yourself in advance for the no parking. They don't have a parking lot but they do have valet which is a plus for some but I usually park on a nearby side street and walk (helps when you over indulge on the schnitzel). Hopefully you enjoy yourself! :)"}
{"text":"Just too f n loud.  Granddaughters crying over the noise.  Food looks great but not a place I'd come back to with a"}
{"text":"You might think that it would be weird for non-drinkers to show up at a beer hall such as this, but we non-drinkers too know that the best food is located at the places with the booze.

My boyfriend and I loved all the german vibes of the place. The bench style, the costumes, the band (we didn't hear them play but saw them drinking beer ahead of time and doing a cheer!). 

We split the wiener schnitzel meal that came with cranberry sauce and German potato salad. We also split the appetizer platter: fried pickles, potato pancakes, onion rings, and sauerkraut balls (comes with apple sauce, sour cream, and mustard). My oh my. So much yumminess! The wiener schnitzer on its own was a bit try, but cover it in one of the side sauces and it was excellent. I have been craving this potato salad since I went to Germany  many years ago, so I was pleasantly surprised/pleased when I saw it on the menu. By far the sauerkraut balls were the favorite on the appetizer plate. I'm not the biggest fan of sauerkraut myself, but it was a perfect blend of sauerkraut and dough in a perfect fried ball shape. Seriously great. The fried pickles were simply that, and the onion rings were ginormous, it was hard to find the onion! Loved every oily crunch. I really enjoyed the potato pancakes with the applesauce and sour cream.

I really enjoyed the place, and next time I'm near one of these again, I'll go. The service, atmosphere, and food all deserve every one of these five stars. ICH LIEBE DICH!"}
{"text":"I'd currently give the CLE haus 3 stars, but having been to the Pittsburgh location multiple times for a solid 4 star experience, I think the Cleveland location is still warming up and so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

I will start by saying that you need to carefully choose when you'll be visiting based on what type of experience you wish to have. If, for example, you want to catch up with a friend or family from out of town then a weeknight or weekend afternoon is great. If, as is usually my reason to visit, you are looking for \"something different\" to do with your usual group of friends then Friday or Saturday night in the beer hall is your jam (get there earlier than you'd normally go out to avoid lines). By \"something different\" I of course mean: you still want to get too drunk with your besties but are reaching that stage in your 20s where you wonder should I have stopped enjoying drinking beer at the local watering hole by now? The answer is no and the hofbrauhaus will help you feel better about this. People of all ages, including 70 year olds in matching tshirts, will be drinking liters of beer, dancing with dames half their age, and singing along to drinking songs  while standing on their table benches. Friday and Saturday nights are for this type of activity, not for a quiet meal.

I probably visited a dozen times before ever trying their food. Their beer is good and brewed on site - lager, light lager, hefe Weizen (my favorite, a wheat beer) and dunkel (dark but very drinkable). Be aware the liter is equivalent to three beers! 

When I finally did try the food, I started with the soft pretzel and beer cheese - DEFINITELY DIP IN THE BEER CHEESE. The fried pickles are also delicious. The schnitzel makes for a nice, hearty lunch. The German sausage platters are tasty and enough to share between two people. Recently went for a yelp event and they served the meat and cheese board - had no idea what meats I was eating but they sure were good. This is something id have never ordered on my own, but definitely will order in the future as it is great for sharing over a few beers.

The service at the Cleveland location is still a little slow but friendly. Definitely improving each time I go. The Pittsburgh location, which has been open for years, runs like a well oiled machine so I think the Cleveland location will get their eventually. The outdoor beer garden is set to open soon and I'm super excited - Cleveland is on for a treat!"}
{"text":"I am very surprised by the snotty reviews on here. Especially the girl whining about how they were being encouraged to finish their beers at 130 in the morning .... By the way you acted in a review, I'm sure you're a real delight when you're drunk at 130 in the morning. I think you left out the part where you were actually kicked out. Are you really that upset that you couldn't keep boozing for another 30 minutes? Good Lord.

Well my family and I had a wondeful experience. My mother, who is from Germany, loved the decor and said that it reminded her of back home. All of the wait staff was very friendly, including ours. 

Everyones meals were fantastic. We tried the warm pretzels first and they were delish. I cant remember the name of what I got but it was sliced bavarian ham with beer cheese on a pretzel bun. It was faaaantastic. My mother loved her potato pancakes. My kids who are notoriously picky eaters, devoured their mac and cheese that was made with swiss. My father, brother and I sampled a few German beers and they were full of flavor and very tasty.

The main dining hall was a bit loud because a fantastic German band was playing on stage. But that is the entire point of the hall. If you want a quieter experience, they have other rooms, away from the band and the crowd. 

As we were leaving, I inquired about if they had a private dining facility because I need a location for our rehersal dinner this fall. I thought that the food and atmosphere would be a fun venue for such an occasion. One of the hostesses took my family and I upstairs and gave us a full tour of the private dining facilities and answered questions that I had, all without an appointment. She went above and beyond and I really appreciated her taking the time to help me. PS. This place has some great rooms upstairs for private events!

Finally, remember this is a restaurant in downtown Cleveland.  It's going to cost you a little more than a meal at Applebee's in the 'burbs. Also, since it's not ACTUALLY in Germany, it's not perfectly authentic - if you want that, go to GERMANY. With that being said, I loved the setup and decor. My mother, again who is from Germany, loved it. Remember to ask for the dining room if you're a small party that is looking for a more quiet experience. This place would be a perfect idea for St. Patrick's Day, or after a Browns or Indians game.

Yet another great thing about C-town, The Hofbrauhaus! We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. The Manager took my Grandfather and I on a mini tour of the place. 
He was very friendly and welcoming. The beer is great too."}
{"text":"I Drove 2 hours from Columbus to join my friends for New Years Eve at the Haufbrauhous. After waiting about 45 minutes to get in we were finally seated where we waited about another 30 min until we received our first beer. Luckily the beer was large because no one ever came around after that to offer us another one. Appetizers were included in our ticket and were average at best. 

I did enjoy the band as they had a lot of energy and got the crowd going. 

The bar advertised the party would go from 9-2:30, however at 1:30 the lights were turned on and they began kicking people out. I brought this up to one of the bartenders. I am not sure how he is employed as he has zero customer service skills. He began laughing at me and making jabs at my character. He then told me he did not care if I left negative reviews as they would take it down if I used his name. I have no idea if this is true but his name is one letter and is between the letters I and K. 

At this point it was about 1:40. This lovely bartender then told me he would not serve me because last call was already made. About 30 seconds later another bartender who did not hear our conversation yelled out last call. At last I received my second beverage of the night as this lovely gentlemen had no choice but to serve me.

To the unnamed bartender, I hope 2015 treats you better so you no longer have to take your misery out on others.

As for the bar itslef, Munich would be embarrassed."}
{"text":"Loved the design and atmosphere! Very clean too - and that's always nice! Our waiter was great and we enjoyed our food! We tried the potato pancakes - great taste & def filling! My mom ordered the pork - she absolutely loved it! We are a chicken & dumpling family and she's always wanted to try bread dumplings - kind of like thanksgiving stuffing in the texture of a flour dumpling! Different and good! I LOVED the weirner snitzel! Best I've had in a long time! I also tried both of the potato salads - the house (normal vinegar)one was better then the German (sweet vinegar) one to me. U have to like vinegar to like either tho! 

The apple streusel was very good too! I could only handle a bite or two by the time we were done w our meals tho!"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the beer, love the atmosphere! Go at lunch for a less crowded time, but if you enjoy it loud, and boisterous go for dinner. I personally love the potato soup, and pretzels with beer cheese :)"}
{"text":"We went to the Hoffbrauhaus last night, to celebrate my girlfriend birthday with a group of 10 of us. We waited outside in the cold for 45 minutes just to get in, which we were totally ok with. None of us had ever been there before, and we're very excited, especially seeing the massive party going on with live music and all. Eventually it was our time to be sat. The bitchy host woman sat us upstairs and away from the whole big party downstairs, in some half empty, dimly lit tavern hall. I asked why this was happening, she said \"Oh don't worry there's plenty of people up here and drinks to go around and live music starting soon\". We accepted it and we're sat. Within 30 minutes we were literally the only people in this room. The live band packed up and never even played. Our server was half an idiot and messed up orders, never cleared empty plates, took forever for refills, etc. We were kind and never a nuisance to her. The only saving grace was the food, which was above average at best, and a bit overpriced. Overall a poor experience.  We ended up walking down to East 4th to actually have a good time and to drink. 
It was almost a joke to come to Hoffbrauhaus to celebrate and party, and to be sat in some empty room upstairs in the quiet with no music. They should of refunded our Uber rides we took to get there."}
{"text":"Wuth HB being my absolute favorite beer in the planet, I've been wanting to make it here for awhile.  We came around 5pm on a Sunday, so not super busy.  The hostess girl was a typical college age girl... Probably a summer hire, but really not friendly at all.  She was grumpy and did not treat any of us waiting for a seat with any kindness whatsoever. Oh well,  we didn't let that ruin our experience. 

We ordered Jager schnitzel and shweinebraten, with 2 liters of dunkelweizen. The beer was to die for! Probably a bit cold for German standards but great nonetheless. 

The food was actually very good with good size portions. Probably could use a much heaftier portion of gravy.... Because i didn't have enough to soak up the second half of schnitzel with.  I've lived in Germany 12 years.... so I'll tell you they're not cheap on gravy over there. 

The staff seemed short staff. Not too many smiling faces and they seemed young and not into it. This place would do bettter to examine their hiring practices and management. 

We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"The place is fun but the service pretty much sucks. I came here on Sunday evening and we just stood by the please wait to be seated sign for about 15 minutes before anyone noticed us.   At least 3 employees walked by us before any of them acknowledged us. When the girl at the desk finally came over, she talked to the family behind us and seated them before us because they claimed to have a reservation. After finally being seated the waiter seemed slightly more attentive. He did seem knowledgeable regarding the menu. We ordered the drinks first and that too took him a while. We had the riesenbrezen combo and the platter with all the fried veggies like fried onions rings, fried pickles and such. The food fine. It wasn't any exceptional. I did really enjoy the obtaza cheese dip. The place was quite loud. There was entertainment but since kids ate free, the live entertainment was for the kids. I did think it was interesting that the TV was set to TBS showing a movie inappropriate for kids. I guess the plan was to keep them distracted with food and the chicken dance. The place is fine, nothing exceptional. It's a good place to relax and drink with friends."}
{"text":"Nope. No way. H**l no.
TERRIBLE service. 
Visit 1 - After dinner, we asked for the check and let the server know that we needed to get to another appointment...30 minutes later, no check. When my impatience started showing, our server pulled a disappearing trick. I finally walked over to the back and asked two other servers clustered around the cash register if we could please get our check. That's how I found out that their computer system was down and they were unable to process credit cards. In the thirty minutes that we were waiting for our check (we hadn't even handed our credit card over yet) no one bothered to inform us that their system was down but we could pay cash if we wanted. 
We hastily pooled together all the cash we had which amounted to the check plus approximately 12% for tip. Once the server noticed that the tip wasn't up to their standard, I was snottily told that it wasn't the wait staff's problem that the computer system was down. Umm...ok...I get that the wait staff have no control over the computer system. But was it the wait staff's problem that we had to wait for 30 minutes before we were even told that the computer system was down? Yes. Was it the wait staff's problem that we didn't get even an acknowledgement of the delay? YES! We experienced zero service recovery. 

Visit 2 - We have some fun memories associated with the Hofbrauhaus in Cincinnati which is why we decided to give the Cleveland Hofbrauhaus one more chance. This time it was with a group of friends on a Saturday evening. We had heard stories of 60 minute waits so weren't surprised when we saw a line snaking out the door and along the side of the building. What we weren't prepared for was the way in which the wait was being handled. Hofbrauhaus seems to operate on the following wait system:
1) Do you know the hostess? Yes? You are in!
2) Did you sweet talk the hostess (maybe a monetary exchange involved)? Yes? You are in!
3) Did you happen to hear the hostess as she ran past the line calling out 'Party of six! Does anyone have a party of six?' Yes? You are in!
4) Did you expect to be seated because you waited in line like...wait...you are supposed to? Yes? No Hofbrauhaus for you!
We waited for close to two hours. Then as we saw another sweet talker come back from the hostess station with a smile on her face and then watched her large group being called from all the way in the back of the line to be seated, we gave up and decided to save what was left of the evening by going to Batiste and Dupree instead. 
Save yourself the aggravation and go spend your hard earned money somewhere else."}
{"text":"Middle of the road rating is all I can give it...  For the price of the food and drinks, there were clear winners and losers, for the service we received, it was a hit or miss.  

I went to the Hofbrauhaus on 2 separate occasions, both times with reservation made with open table.  This is a part 1 of 2 review.  This review from September 2015 and Part 2 of 2 from October. 

For someone who's never been there, the part between you car to the front door of the restaurant was an adventure in itself.  The parking situation was a bit \"scattered\", luckily I looked it all up in advance (at night, alone... probably not the best idea for some parking spaces...), not very well lit off the main street at night, valet flying around the corner in patrons' cars, and trying to cross the street were some of the obstacle courses to overcome just to get to the restaurant.  Once we got to the front door, it was unclear if patrons are suppose to wait in line even with the reservation or not, until I asked the outdoor bartender, which he said I may \"enter at the exit\" and speak to one of the hostesses.  

Upon walking in, there was a short line just a bit out the door at 430pm, I approached an elderly hostess and asked \"I have a reservation, who should I speak to?\"   Her rapid reply was, \"they have reservations too\" and frantically escorted a group of 4 into the dining room.  Did I mention this was my boyfriend's birthday, a surprise birthday, and 3 friends were sitting at a table in advance to surprise him...?  When I made the reservation, I was asked if this would be the first time to the restaurant, the occasion, any special requests... I clearly stated, never been to the party, a  surprise birthday party, bringing cake etc. when I made the reservation.  I felt that I wasted the effort stating all this in advance to be useless.  Anyway... I turned to the hostess stand, a young lady was clearly off the clock looking over the schedule with part of her uniform in her hands, she actually stopped what she was doing and offered to take me to my table.  Kudos to her!

Skipping to the food, pretzel and cheese was good (we ordered the combo), the potato pancake was good, but skip the salmon, it was overpriced for the slivers of salmon.  The Braumeister Schinitzel was good, I actually really liked the sauerkraut (usually not a fan), but skip the Hofbrahaus Wurstplatte, because indeed it was the worst-plate, $18 for hot dogs and mashed potato.   

After dinner, I asked the server to please bring some plates and forks for the bite size dessert pastries I brought for the occasion.  As I started passing out plates, each plate was dirtier than the next to the 3rd plate out of 5, it was clear that either the dishwasher need an upgrade, may it be the person or the machine, or the server should care just a bit about what they do for a living.  Don't get me wrong, they already don't have to set up tables, a well set table at Hofbrahaus has a big jug with plenty of utensils, napkins and condiments on the table... if you are lucky, you might just have enough utensils for the number of people in your party.  In my opinion, they least the server could've done was check the plates before dumping 5 dirty plates at the table and take off... I waited, and waited, looking for our server, trying to flag down someone, I stood up at the front by the band looking around, 5 minutes gone by... clearly needing service, 10 minutes came and left and I counted 2 food runners and 3 servers passed me up, one of them being our server.  Finally, I approached our server at the server's station and just showed him the plates.  \"Ooopppss...\" he said and handed me 5 more plates.

Because we were celebrating, I didn't make a stink about it, but I paid over $100 for the 2 of us to get inconsistent food, \"slightly-better-than-lite beers\" and negligent service.  As a former service industry employee, one can tell which server is working towards having great experiences with the patrons and striving to have more fun at work versus those who's there just to punch in the order and refill a glass or two and expecting 20%.  Based on my observation, we got the 4/10 service that day and I can't overlook some of the details that could've improved our experiences... A-O-K... not impressed overall."}
{"text":"Over 10 minutes after sitting down and waving 2 different waitresses we still couldn't put in an order. The ruebens we ordered had super soggy bread as if they had been premade and were sitting in the kitchen.  Bright spots were the live music (which only lasted for the first five minutes) and the bright lights. Still going through growing pains."}
{"text":"I'm not one to spend time leaving comments like this but I have to take some time to specifically leave some comments and concerns about this place.  To start, you have to wait outside-in cleveland-with no outside heaters.  You've got to be out of your ever loving mind!  We had reservations for a large party of 21 for my nephew's 21st birthday, half adults and half barely over 21.  We went to the comedy show upstairs.  You'd think they've never had a large party up there before. They had nothing properly set up and they acted like we were a bother for asking to move some tables around so we wouldn't have to spit our party up.  They were kind of rude about it up there.  We had a reservation so it's not like we just showed up but whatever. 

Our plan was to go downstairs for some shot ski's with my nephew.  They literally made us walk out in an ally and wait back outside in the cold to get back in after we already spent hundreds of dollars upstairs.  I'm in this industry and have never heard of anything so stupid!!  You have people already in your building and ready to spend money and you send them outside to wait back in line???!!!?!?  Dude, how stupid are you?!?  Only because my sister put us on a waiting list ahead of time and because she specifically wanted to do a shot ski with my nephew did we go back in.  Some of us may or may not have walked away with mugs.  After all, at this point they sent us tipsy outside with beer in hand and had food to put in our cars soooo......not smart dudes....not smart.  

Lastly, once we finally got inside the place AGAIN our waitress was rude AF!  I mean, it wasn't even necessary.  Like I said, I'm in industry and you'd really be surprised at the at the amount of people I would swear were raised in a barn but nonetheless, we may have been large and out of the norm but the rudeness was absolutely uncalled for.  

Food was great, a little over priced but that I can live with.  The atmosphere is nice and warm.  For me, it was the rudeness, the stupidity and making people wait in the cold that has resulted me taking the time to type all this on my Sunday Funday."}
{"text":"Good food, not great, nice family/party type atmosphere in-house brewery ,good,almost to good of service, got our food before our app. No problem took app home, fun time"}
{"text":"This is a really fun place to have some drinks and eat some appetizers. It's loud, it's fun to watch the servers get up and dance, and I enjoy watching everyone do \"shot-skis\". The big ass pretzel is delicious, the onion rings are amazing, and the lobster bisque is pretty good. However, the actual food...ehhh. I've had the beef stroganoff and some other type of spatezle with onions and like a Swiss cheese topping. Both of those dishes were incredibly bland. I would just eat my weight in apps and stick to the beer."}
{"text":"Negative -5 stars!!!!! KAT-horrible server & worse management in the history of all my 40+ restaurant dining years. Waited 20+ minutes for water, never got our beers when we did it was because of another serve. We were the first table to be seated out of two other tables and we watched how their service was seamless & without confusion. When we asked to speak with the manager, her excuse was that there was only one bartender???? I told her that that made no sense because we watched the other tables that placed orders after us get their beers and their appetizers & they started their experience with water??? This place sucked!!!!! Food was no better & I would really hate to think it was because we weren't German? Because our money was green & I will make it my business to discourage anyone from enduring the unwelcoming & totally unpalatable experience the four of us did. Good Luck adventure seekers!!!!"}
{"text":"Went there for opening day, and it was extremely fun! Brew was the best part, as we couldn't get in to get a table for real food, and had to settle for brats. It was overpriced a bit, but a ton of fun. I've also been to the ones in Cinci, Pittsburgh, and Munchen, and this seems right in line with all of them, sans the Waterfront view, which is a bummer.  I don't know why this wasn't one of the new places popping up on the east bank of the flats! 

But the beer and atmosphere are still well worth it!"}
{"text":"We were here for a 50th birtday party with 4 couplels, had an awsome time. band was fantastic, food was a 6 out of 10 not bad, the atmosphere was awesome people really had a good time you have to try it you won't be disappointed,"}
{"text":"One of the worse lunch dining experiences I have had.  We should have known it was going to be a mess when we were told we'd be seated in five minutes and it took nearly 20 and the seating was ridiculous.  They tried to seat our party of four inside a booth with an elderly party of three who was already in the middle of their lunch and was not willing to get up and move to let us slide into the open seats.  The hostess kept telling us to sit and we looked at the girl and asked \"how? Do we climb over these people?!\" Finally, a waitress moved us to another booth and a couple of nice gentlemen agreed to slide down and let us sit.  We ordered  an appetizer of sauerkraut balls and our food as soon as a waiter would take our order.  And then we waited.  And waited.  Finally the sauerkraut balls came out and they were delicious.  The rest of our food however was no where to be seen.  The gentleman seated next to use got their food twice over as the kitchen made a double order.  An hour after we ordered we were told five more minutes....20 minutes after that we had our food brought to us in to-go containers because we were now all late getting back to work.  Arriving back at my desk to eat my now cold perogies I opened the container to find they were burnt.  The sauerkraut balls and our server Dave were the only good things about this place which is why it got two stars and not one.  It was terrible.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"The schnitzel was good and the beer was good. The service was awful! I did not get what I ordered. I ask for it to be changed but the never brought me the correct food and tried to charge me for something I did not order. Plus it was not even busy. Maybe a different server would have made the difference."}
{"text":"Food, great. Beer, awesome. Environment, fantastic. Service, terrible. Hope this was a rare occurrence, but we barely saw our server (Lisa M). It took 20min to order drinks after being seated. Then, our appetizers failed to arrive until our entrees came out. Lastly, our server took 45min figuring out another tables check, and then gave us attitude after we waited for our checks. Had to flag down a manager; they weren't very considerate. I know this is nit-picky but our server couldn't pronounce anything on the menu, shows poor training. Very disappointed at what could be a gem for the local German community."}
{"text":"Don't go for the food, go for the experience. The atmosphere is loud and fun, the band gets the crowd involved and the servers are great. They are extremely pushy when it comes to seating. Read reviews about long lines, so My husband and I got there around 340 and got seared by 4. I had told the lady several times there was going to be 16 of us. Of course most of my people were there by 5 but about 6 were late. The older lady hostess came over probably 10 times to ask when they were coming. She kept trying to seat people at our table. However our server had placed a reserved sign on a table next to us for the 6 people who were late. She finally brought her manager over at around 10 mins to 5 and I told him give me 10 mins. They all showed up and while walking to the bathroom the hostess apologized to me. I can understand the pressure but I told her multiple times they were coming. I got a brat for dinner and it was horrible with way too much bread. The fries were really good tho. The beer is delicious and the shotskis are fun. My advise is go late afternoon like we did, but make sure all of your guests show up on time! Valet parking is $12 and the parking lot across the street was 15 so you might as well valet! The 3 stars are for overall experience. Atmosphere was very fun, food not so much, pressure by hostess and management was extremely annoying but apology was nice. However, just know if you go here you will be dropping some major dough$$ we spent almost $200 for the two of us and 4 shotskis. I highly recommend Julius for your server. He is the bomb! Gave him a huge tip because he was so good."}
{"text":"Been here many times now.  The best thing here is the beer.  The food all tastes like its brought in frozen and just warmed up on site.  Servers can be good but are always taking care of so many spread out tables its a pain in the ass if you need anything on a whim, like a to-go container or more napkins.  Place always is packed but not obnoxious.  The live music can be interesting.  Glad to see polka has other places to be seen than some V.F.W. hall in Parma.  Parking is highway robbery and I wish people would stop using it so maybe they get the hint they are robbing people blind.  But, I guess 5 business turds get out of an Escalade and a corporate card could care less.  Also, the hostess-with-the-mostess German lady who seats people asked us \"Do you have reservations?\" at 4pm when there were only 20 people in there.  Then proceeded to give us a crappy look when we said no.  As we watched her seat people with the most cold and callous way possible we wondered why on Earth you would put this lady as the face of your establishment.  Who cares if she's wearing a dirdle and sounds like the dude from Hogans Heroes...shes a beotch..."}
{"text":"Not like the old location; very noisy and really slow service. The food however is authentic and delicious. I'm 50/50 on returning. That polka band was good; yet annoy"}
{"text":"I'm into Hofbrauhaus. it's exactly what I expected it to be, though I hadn't originally realized it was a chain & feel a little disappointed to learn so. I hate to be a snob, but that makes me less inclined to give it my patronage.

That said, who can resist massive glass mugs of beer, massive Bavarian hot pretzels, & the kitsch of servers clad in \"authentic\" German dress? I've never been here for live music, so I can't speak to that experience, but I'm a fan of the high ceilings, bright lighting, & cozy atmosphere. I'm also a fan of their karoffelpuffers, more commonly known as, you know, potato pancakes. Also? Gimme all your sp√§tzle. *heart eyes*

I also like that this place is HUGE, though that never seems to prevent there from being a very, very long wait - which I suspect is due to the subpar service, which is always far slower than it ought to be at such a behemoth of a restaurant (especially a chain). I also wish it were in a more desirable part of town, but there's ample parking nearby, which is a plus, & it's the sort of place where you can camp out for a few hours & make a night of it."}
{"text":"Oh Hofbrauhaus. 

From my experiences, there's always a line out the door to get into the joint, and the wait to even get in is horrendous. With that being said, if you actually get in, it's worth it. It's so fun, there's always live music (SWEEETTT CAROLINE!), people are doing shotskis on top of tables, and the steins of beer are as big as your head. They also have amazing pretzels and beer cheese. 

I've always found myself at the bar at this restaurant. We find a seat, and STAY THERE, because if not, you'll lose it to someone. The bartenders are always cool, and efficient. 

Again, this is solely based on my experience of going on crazy nights. I have no idea what it's like on a slower evening, but then again, I don't know if this would be a place I'd want to go for just a dinner night. As it is a bit on the pricy side, I'd prefer to spend my money elsewhere.  To me, this place is for getting super boozed up with tons of steins of beer and going a little wild on tables and chairs in the process."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere that promises a good time. Yes, it is very crowded and you have to wait in line to get in but it did just open up, so no surprise there. I loved how much fun everyone was having and the live music was great. People were standing up on their chairs and having a blast. The service was good and the beers are huge. I like the shot boards they bring out so everyone can take a shot together.

The food was so-so but did the trick since you are drinking so much beer. I recommend the pretzels and sauerkraut balls yum! I love that they decided to bring a location to Cleveland! It's a huge space with everyone working there dressed in German attire which is an added bonus. Now I want to go to Munich to check out the real thing!"}
{"text":"I visited the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich in 2010, and that was a great experience. I was very excited to hear that we were getting one in Cleveland, and I couldn't wait to visit. 

A group of us from the office went there for lunch, and it did not disappoint. Outstanding! 

The building is gorgeous, service is great, and you can't beat that food!"}
{"text":"Had a great time hanging out and drinking good German beer with good friends.  However, the place is rather expensive. $12 per mug of the Oktoberfest beer.  

The food was good, I had the sauerbratten.  But I have had better German food elsewhere around Cleveland like Der Braumiester on the west side.

{"text":"Very fun place, absolutely love the atmosphere here.  Fun for kids, super friendly staff.  This is the second year we have eaten here for lunch in between swim meet sessions.  Easy to get into for lunch, no wait at all.  Had the pretzel with beer cheese, not sure how to say yum in German, but that is my assessment.  Husband and I split Perugia and perch, did not think I would like the onions atop the pirogies.  Clearly I was wrong, flavors were perfectly melded, top with some sour cream and oh my.  Perch was also good.  Kids had chicken tenders, kids pretzel, and Mac and cheese.  They were not a fan of the applesauce because it was chunky.  They can be very vanilla with their eating at times, I did not try it.  It was very relaxing,  will definitely be back.  Beer was good.  Kids loved drinking from huge glasses."}
{"text":"The beer is amazing!  The atmosphere was so fun!  We got the meat and cheese board and it's huge could never eat it all it's more for 4 people."}
{"text":"Institutional food. It's no wonder the food tastes like a school cafeteria I saw a GFS truck delivering.
I have eaten here over a dozen times and never had a good meal. I mainly go for the beer.

 I work nearby and  wish they would step it up.
 
The staff is nice although they could smile more."}
{"text":"Such a horrible experience I need to post my first review ever for a restaurant...
Friends in town from Atlanta and six adults and eight kids all leave for the Playhouse for an 11am play for the Children's series.  We finish at 12 and walk into Hofbauhaus at 12:05.  Immediately seated, waitress Kristen very nice, takes are drink orders and brings the beverages and then takes our order at 12:15.  Limited lunch menu with 8 items which you would think they would get food out almost instantly... although that wasn't the expectation.  At 1pm the kids' food is brought out for 6 of the 8 kids.  45 minutes for a pretzel and applesauce and cheese, but they forget the cheese.  45 minutes for a pretzel and applesauce... and they don't serve all the kids.  15 minutes later the rest of the food comes out.  One diner has a burger that is raw and sends it back.  It comes back to us raw again.  At this point the kids are done and about ready to leave. 
We ask the waitress, who was great, for the manager and we are told the woman that comes to us is the manager.  After telling her the issues above her solution was to not charge for the burger and give our friend a reuben that had to go in a box as we had to leave.  The \"manager\" argued with us that it couldn't have taken an hour for food, and just kept arguing and saying \"well what do you want me to do\".  At that point the chance to fix the terrible experience was over and the damage was done.  She continued to argue and I eventually had to repeatedly tell her to get away from us and leave the area as the whole thing was so absurd.
While leaving I then asked her who she reported to... at which time I was referred to the real manager.  I repeated this whole story and it ended with me being told he would talk to his floor manager about how it wasn't handled well.  That was it... the entire solution to our problem.  I told him I looked forward to posting my first review ever immediately upon getting home.  I informed him I'm season ticket holder for Playhouse and am there every month and I am a frequent diner in the Playhouse area and I will never return and will be sure to share the horrible experience."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus Cleveland delivers your traditional German beer hall experience, with a cooler vibe and great service. We got there on a Saturday around 7PM and the line was down the street and around the corner long...We settled in for a long wait, but then surprisingly a gentleman walked over and asked us if we wanted to get in faster by choosing the upstairs option. The upstairs hall is smaller, and a little more low-key. They offer the same great food, plus a buffet and an amazing band! Who would say no to that?

So our group of 12 headed upstairs, we ate, we drank (too many shot-skis!!) and we danced. At one point, we were even up on the stage singing and dancing with the band. Hopefully that video does not surface and go viral, LOL! After a few hours upstairs, we made our way downstairs. The beer hall is definitely more crowded, much louder -- people standing on the benches, your typical beer hall scene. The polka music was awesome, with a mix of newer tunes weaved in. Good times being had by all! 

The drinks: my husband is all-beer, all-the-time so he loved all the brewed in-house options. I am not a beer drinker, but they have a full bar so all was well for me, too. My husband and some friends partook in shot-skis a few times. They basically carry out a ski (as in, snow ski!) and there are shots lined up on it. Everyone does the shot all at once as you tip the ski up and back-- very entertaining to watch, that is for sure! 

As for the food: The potato pancakes are to die for! Everything else was good (schnitzel, pretels, fried onions, all fat-free obviously!!) but definitely get the pancakes when you stop by. Prost!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place for a comedy show and dinner. The food was amazing, and u get lots of it. The beer was good but kinda pricey if you're looking for a cheap time. The people standing on the Chairs and having fun was amazing, live bands great service good times. But it can only last for so long. This place is tooooooooo crowded for everything that's happening, and after about an hour it all gets kinda annoying. Overall cool place definitely a needed experience. I would love to say\" I'm gonna go back.\" Not sure if I will tho. It's kinda all in all too much."}
{"text":"Hofbrauhaus is a great, fun location to go with a group of people. The shot skis look like a lot of fun, although I didn't try one. I went on an early Saturday afternoon around 430. They didn't have the beer I originally ordered, and when I was ready for my second round, I had to ask the server three times for another drink. Three times?! We had a pretty large group but I still don't understand how you can forget someone's drink for that long.

Food wise, I only had a side of the pierogies. Everyone I was with seemed pretty happy with their food. I feel like there is definitely room for improvement, but if you show up for a good time you can definitely find it here. I will give it a second chance sometime soon and hope for better service."}
{"text":"The food was very mediocre, but the atmosphere was great. Can I just say, I really appreciate that the waitresses outfits were maybe a bit flirty but definitely not over the top. I don't like to go to restaurants where I feel like I'm at a strip club. Ever been to the Tilted Kilt? Ew, I shudder. This is not that, and I am very happy. There was polka band when we stopped in which lent to the atmosphere. The place is beautiful, so go, have a drink, maybe the food will improve and I'll go back and update this review, but you can't go wrong if you go for a drink and huge hot pretzel appetizer."}
{"text":"This place is so cool! Brand new place in downtown Cleveland. The energy and crowd here is so fun and upbeat! We ordered pretzels with cheese and they were delicious. Our group also ordered a shotski-really cool and fun way to take group shots. They had a live band who were really great!"}
{"text":"Ugh, their Arnold Palmer specialty drink is horrible. I had to have mine re-made, and it was still all tea no vodka. I drank both of them and didn't even get a flush, despite the claims that there is half a cup of vodka included. 

As for the beer... I'm no beer snob, so I guess it was good? I drank some of my friend's, and everyone seemed to enjoy theirs as well! I was very impressed with the HUGE MUGS the most harharhar. The pretzels were decent enough, but slightly overpriced. I don't know, considering this is a German bar I think maybe I set my expectations too high. That live band though, wooo!! I enjoyed that and the dancing on the chairs. 

And before I go, just as a warning to other females driving alone: I was uneasy for my first visit here. The nearby parking is paid, and I wasn't about to cough up $10 that could be spent on alcohol. I did off street parking around the corner a bit. I was alone so I was a little on edge since this area isn't the best. So, I would advise BYOF (bring your own friend) for any trip here."}
{"text":"Love Hofbrauhaus! Different vibe compared to many of the other bars in Cleveland: huge beersteins, dancing on tables, live bands, brightly lit, high ceilings, huge room.

Don't bother with any of the food (which contributes to much of the lost stars in this review), just come here to drink the beer and get tipsy. There's nothing craft nor delicate on tap; just (a lot of) decent Pi√üwasser. If you need something to soak up the ridiculous amounts of beer, order a few pretzels and nibble as you drink.

On your way out, you may opt to purchase the beerglass you drank from. Do it. It'll sit on your shelf unused in all its gigantic glory - unless, of course, you're the type of person to crack open 5-6 cold ones with the boys... all at once."}
{"text":"So, I should probably start with a quick preface.  I'm pushing 30, I'm relatively well traveled, and I've been not only to the actual Hofbrauhaus in Munich, but numerous other Bavarian restaurants and monasteries... the kind tourists don't go to and you need to speak actual German in order to get anywhere at.

With that said, I was pretty disappointed.  Going in, I knew and acknowledged that Bavaria sets a pretty high bar, and as a result I did not expect \"Germany in Cleveland\"; that's just not fair.  However, I *was* expecting a place that sets itself apart from the other \"come and get drunk here\" establishments in town but, as it turns out, that's unfortunately pretty much what the Hofbrauhaus Cleveland is.  Now, before I start to sound too critical, I will say this: ultimately, I did have fun!  It was heartening to see a room full of people drinking something other than Budweiser and genuinely enjoying themselves.  The band was great, and there's absolutely a fun and somewhat unique atmosphere here that definitely encourages \"audience participation...\" and also lots of pretty girls to gaze creeplily upon. 

After nearly 2 hours in line on a Friday night, we were sat next to a group of very, very drunk [presumably] college kids.  They literally spilled their beer all over us, used my buddy's coat as a mop, and were generally enormously inconsiderate.  They physically fell onto us more than a few times.  Ultimately, the house security came... and the police came.. and they were cut off and kicked out.  The management comped our meals and gave us gift cards, which they absolutely did not have to do, so credit where it's due, I think the Hofbrauhaus people did the right thing here and took care of us.  It's certainly more than we got from the people who were actually total pieces of obnoxious garbage and couldn't even say sorry when they left.  Hey, by the way, if this was you and you're reading this, you suck at life.  We did get a \"sorry for having fun\" from someone who was at their table which, apart from sounding totally sarcastic and insulting, is not even close to recompense for being an absolute tool, and also did not come from any of the actual perpetrators.  But I digress.

The Hofbrauhaus Cleveland is, at least on a Friday night, essentially a big, noisy college party.  You WILL hear \"Hang on Sloopy\" [O-H-I-O!!!] at least 3 times.  Dozens of college kids WILL be drunkenly dancing on the tables around you, and you will NOT meet anyone of actual German decent.  It's VERY Cleveland-y.  If you're a college kid from Cleveland, you will probably adore the place.  I mean, who doesn't love singing (screaming?) the fight song of a college in a town they've never even been to, let alone graduated from?  Again, I can't be too critical, because anywhere that serves hefeweizen and has live music is a step in the right direction.  However, if you've ever been to Bayern, or if you're expecting anything like an actual German establishment, you will be grossly disappointed.  Even at the height of the evening in Munich, I could still carry on a conversation with the BMW executive who sat next to me at the real Haufbrauhaus.  I couldn't even hear myself think here... in fact my ears are still ringing.

So, in summation, while I appreciate many aspects of the Hofbrauhaus Cleveland, and the management absolutely did right by us, I don't know that I can recommend it.  It absolutely is *not* \"authentically German,\" and anyone who says it is has obviously never been to southern Germany.  I'd say it's \"authentically Cleveland, with a German twist.\"  If you're a CSU undergrad, you'll love it.  If you're a world traveler who's actually experienced German culture... mehhh... just know what you're getting into.  And the food and drink?  It was adequate.  There's better elsewhere in Cleveland..."}
{"text":"food was good .. would return .. but I gotta say the beer hall seating made for an awkward experience .. we had a party of 2 .. we were seated w/a single diner at the same time .. same table .. table that had a larger party of 6 already seated .. we ordered the pretzel w/beer cheese appetizer & since it was so loud that the single diner did not hear what we ordered she assumed the pretzels were complimentary (the larger party had them on their end of the table as well) so she simply helped herself to our appetizer .. I felt it was rude to tell her it was food we paid for since she had already pulled a pretzel from the basket & was dipping it in the beer cheese & mustard already but I gotta think this was probably not the 1st time this has happened to other diners .. it would be nice if they had other private seating for those that may not prefer beer hall dining .. just saying .."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner before seeing a play. It's a short walk to Playhouse square. 5:45 on a Thursday. The inside was ear splitting loud - no way to talk in there so we opted to sit outside. The hostess sat us in a field of gravel in the still bright sun. There were two umbrellas but no effort to sit people near them - just weird. We sat in the bright sunshine - fortunately it was spring and not blazing hot. Eventually a young man came and took our drink orders. Then we waited. Eventually a manager say us and asked if we had been waited on. We said yes. He sent a different waitress to take our order again. She brought drinks. 5 minutes later the first guy showed up with drinks. It was a cluster. Food was mediocre. So if you like moronic characters dressed in \"German\" clothing acting like whatever stereotype of Germans you have this is your place. Cleveland has such great restaurants why would anyone go to a train wreck like Haufbrau House? We won't again."}
{"text":"Awesome experience.  Having a reservation is a must.  It is not your run of the mill restaurant, very social environment.  Music, great beer, great food...a little taste of Munich in Cleveland.  My family really enjoyed the night after a CSU graduation."}
{"text":"Just wanna say the food is very underwhelming. The breading on the fish is thicker than the fish itself. 
The appetizers were better than the entree. I think Ballchen was my favorite."}
{"text":"There was a Billy Joel concert going on the Friday we were in Cleveland, so it was hard to find a table in downtown Cleveland, so we ventured out about a mile.

I have been to one other Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas and it was about the same.

The polka music is fun and the beer is just okay. Our server was a nice enough guy, but the food was just meh. I got a chicken schnitzel salad. The salad was fine enough, but the schnitzel was very underwhelming. Cold/warm and tough.

My wife went to the one in Munich and liked it a lot, but she said it was quite different.

They had a beer stein holding contest, and they didn't even let the people competing keep the beers!

There are a ton of other great restaurants to visit while in Cleveland. For sure try Mabel's. Just amazing BBQ."}
{"text":"I went to Hofbrauhaus for a private event so my experience was admittedly different. We were upstairs in a smaller room with our own polka band and the atmosphere was really great. The room itself was beautiful and really cozy.

Service was good and we got drinks quickly. The beer was exactly what you'd expect. I tried the Original and the Hefe Weizen. Both were just okay. Definitely good enough. 

Food was kind of mediocre. I tried the pretzels (the liquid-y cheese is way better than the pimiento), fried pickles (meh), potato pancakes (great!) and sausage (okay). I would have loved some sauces/mustards to tie everything together. 

Overall, it wasn't bad, but I can't imagine paying upwards of $50 for my entire experience. And no way would I wait in line. The $20 valet parking is also a bit steep."}
{"text":"Having been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, I probably had too high of expectation for this location.  Like others have already said, you don't come here to eat the food.  In fact, it gives German food a bad name.  I wouldn't consider this good German, more like German-American fusion.  Everything was fried and greasy.  Having finished the plate of food I was serviced I sorely regretted it the next day with all day and night trips to the bathroom.

OK so we know the food is bad, don't pay the premium for it.  The beer is great and as I heard is actually the only authentic thing about this Hofbrauhaus.  Be sure to get reservations, otherwise you are looking at an hour and half wait.  The atmosphere is great and there is plenty of fun to enjoy with friends and family.

Visit the original Hofbrauhaus for good German food; visit this location for drinking with your buddies."}
{"text":"Over all, I am disappointed in our evening. We went on a Friday about 5pm, or 5:30.  We parked across the street at a lot for $10. We waited just a few minutes to be seated.  We had to share a booth-like table with another couple, which means they had to get up to let us in.  I don't mind sharing a table, but not being able to get up without disturbing strangers was ackward.  We ordered a pretzel with beer cheese, and two beers.  The beers were great, thoroughly enjoyed them. The pretzel however had no flavor.  We both ordered the grilled chicken with potato salad. I expected the hot potato salad but that is not what came with the chicken.  This potato salad was ice cold, too cold to eat.  Even after it warmed up a bit, I didn't like it. Potato was the only flavor it had. The chicken itself was good. 

They had two accordian players performing. They were good but you could barely hear them.  

I've been to the Pittsburgh Hofbr√§uhaus many times and I really expected a similar experience, but unfortunately that was not the case here in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Went to Hofbrauhaus House several times and loved the food each time. I used the CLEseats app at lunch time and received 20% of my food. I love the potato pancakes and the large pretzel with cheese. I always get the schnitzel with bier cheese and ham. You can get free tickets to their comedy show on the CLE seats app. I went to the show Saturday. The show was pretty good."}
{"text":"We stopped here before the air show activities and it was such a disappointment.  
The service was very lackluster and slow.  They had a band outside, but it was terrible as the singers were off-key.  
Anyway, everything was expensive and unimpressive here...the pretzel was reminiscent of a frozen one you'd buy at the grocery store, the salad was flavorless...the only thing that was decent were the potato pancakes.  
There's a nice patio, but wasps will pester you, so don't bother."}
{"text":"This rating is primarily for the atmosphere, location and service. Took my son as a surprise and he was thrilled. Sat entranced by the accordion players. Our server, Vinny, was very attentive and super.

I enjoyed a seasonal bier - Winterzwickel. Pierogi swerve tasty and the perch was ok, kinda dry. Owen's dinner highlight was the chunky applesauce, which he made me snap a photo of.

The best discovery was that we could access Playhouse Square through a walkway without going on the chilly street."}
{"text":"Okay for some birthday fun. Food is another story. Waited awhile to order while enjoying some German beer. Finally decided on the wiener schnitzel... Nope out of it. Do, switched to sauerbraten... waited 1/2 hour to be told they are out of it. Ordered chicken schnitzel. Dry and flavorless. Come for the beer and pretzels with friends have dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Mettwurst undercooked, salad dressing not as ordered. Kasesp√§tzel tasty. Perogies indifferent. No mustard on table or offered... Waitress said she couldn't pronounce the sausage of the day, so we were just out of luck.

Quiet small crowd at lunch. Walked over from CSU, no sign to find door. Bring car, I guess?"}
{"text":"Reservation done! Step inside, headed to the table (as we are being waved to come meet our family and friends, we are stopped dead in our tracks by some dude playing \"I'm the master\". We had to check in at a desk, really? Lame! 

The atmosphere was awesome, yet, shoving a ton of people in big room.....sorry if there is ever a fire, good luck getting out fast! 

Food, DISGUSTING! Absolutely disgusting! Fried, greasy grossness! Beef stroganoff, where was the beef? More like here is dumplings and a heaping spoonful of mushrooms. I doubt my dogs would touch it. Enjoy the scene of your bathroom after! 

Service was great at first, but then the disappearing act came! I want the check and go! But had to wait and wait. (I get it, it was busy). 

To get out of there was a challenge due to tight quarters! 

High energy, great beers and shots, but overall, it was hard to click 3 stars. Three being for the atmosphere itself! Talk. About pricy food, holy hell!  

Fist and probably the last visit!"}
{"text":"I drove one hour to visit a work colleague for a going away party and was not allowed to enter because they were \"at capacity\". Mind you, a group of coworkers were already there for most of the day with a fairly large table and plenty of extra space (I could see them from where I was being denied entry from the extremely rude manager on call at the time). So a wasted trip due to staff who could not comprehend reason. I will not be returning to this establishment if they continue to treat customers this way."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite drinking spot in cleveland. Great place for a big group of people! They had great live music, and great beers. A little bit more on the pricy side- but to me it is definitely worth the experience."}
{"text":"A mixed review here... The good-in the summer, the patio is a delight, and your dog is welcome too. The owners or managers were so delightful and brought over water for our dog and just made us feel so welcome. Pop into the bar to grab your drinks and you get quick, friendly service. If you sit inside, you get the typical fun, energetic, singing and dancing, live music, Shotski experience that you've come to expect at all locations.

The bad, like with most chain/franchise type places, the food isn't all that.... I was disappointed in my schnitzel - I've had the real thing (for a quarter of the price mind you), and I've even had it from a food truck here in the states, and both, were much better.  My friend's special was the tiniest piece of fish I'd ever seen for an entree; maybe two ounces. The service was beyond slow, for our side of the table, and the party at the end of the table--- the sever forgot drinks several times, and then blamed us for the other party's very late meal (we overheard her say their food was remade because it was accidentally brought to us and we turned it away while they were out smoking- which never happened).

My advice, don't bother with the food--definitely not the entrees (maybe just a pretzel), and if you want faster service, sit outside or at the bar."}
{"text":"I placed on online reservation for 4 at 6:45 PM. I verified the reservation the day prior.  Thought it was bit odd that when I told them i had a reservation placed on line they really didn't know what to do. However they did verify the reservation.  Got there 10 minutes early. PC was down, unable to find the reservation.  20 minutes later they decided to sit us. I know my family. We had no intention of sitting in the beer hall this is why I made reservations for the dinning room. Heck we don't drink beer, we love German food. We got a tour of the entire building trying to find a place to seat us.  As soon as they tried to sit in the beer hall I should have said no.  My fault there.  We sat down at 7 PM and left at 7:05. No drinks, no food they sat 4 of us in a  space meant for 2. 

We were there for dinner not to watch other people get drunk and act like asses.  Music was deafening. 

The complaint here is if you have a reservation for the dinning room honor it for the dinning room. If you don't take reservations for parties unless they are over 30 in size TAKE DOWN YOUR ON-LINE RESERVATION SYSTEM. Every manager I saw that night looked overwhelmed. Total deer in the headlights.  As much fun as some people were having other were totally like how do we get out.

If the place lasts over 2 years I'd be surprised."}
{"text":"There is no authentic German food like this place ! Straight out of Germany , gives to a look into life that makes to forget time ! Great food , kinda pricy but for the amount of food that you get it's worth it in my option . The beer ... oh the beer ! It's everywhere and pretty good ."}
{"text":"It's so cold and they have a line out the door. They should allow large groups to make reservations."}
{"text":"The Hofbrauhaus is definitely an acquired taste. If you like a loud and fun environment and are willing to settle for mediocre food, than this is the place for you. There's live music Tuesday-Sunday, table dancing and shotskis (literally four shots attached to a wooden ski). Their food is hit or miss. Sometimes it's hot and tasty while at other times it's cold and bland. I'd suggest ordering one of their schnitzels. I believe their schnitzel dishes are the better foods to select off their menu. The service is not always the most attentive but is usually friendly. If you're lucky, your waiter or waitress may even ask you to dance. My suggestion, eat at home and go to the Hofbrauhaus for a beer and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Drove a distance to go for lunch. Allowed us to pay for parking. After advertising on their website and the local news that there were open there we actually \"Closed until 9pm for a private party. Would not open the door to talk to me not refund our parking. Will not be returning in principle."}
{"text":"So, I did what every waitress friend tells you not to do. I brought 30 friends without calling ahead!! I know, I know, but I was at a conference and thought it was only going to be five of us. Well five people told five more people and pretty soon we had 30! We had two waitresses who served our group.  Everyone ordered beers, everyone ordered food, and everyone got separate checks for their meals. These gals were real gems- and real pros handling this giant crowd! The food and beers were all awesome and correct!! We sat outside and there was plenty of room on this Monday night. Thank goodness!! The manager told us this much space isn't always available so we were lucky :) Thank you Haufbrau!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, German food,  and beer,  go in for the party!  Authentic German fare - huge pretzels!!  You are going to be seated at tables with other people if you are a group of 4 or smaller. Picnic table like seating. You can make reservations. It is noisy and hard to hear over the talking and music. I think that is part of the fun. People will stand in the seats or table and drink \"ski shots\" and chug beer.  Quick, friendly service. Our waiter was very attentive.  We love this place and come here every time we are in the area."}
{"text":"My family went for a birthday dinner without reservations. Party of 10. Waited inside the door for 2 full hours. Most people did have reservations, so they slid right in. I was not aware they took reservations. So that's on me. My complaint is other smaller parties came in and got seated also without reservations. We kept getting passed over because we had 10 in our party. I believe first come first serve. They should have help space to accommodate 10. Not just filling 4 here, 6 there and so on. I had to complain twice after the 2 hour Mark. The second man I talked with finally made room for us. Apologised 2 times to me. My thought they should have posted reservations only or taken people as they came in and not pick and choose how they seat them.  Very very frustrating to stand for 2 hours right there in front of their desk and never get seated and watch smaller parties go ahead. But.....the food, beer and band was great once we got in."}
{"text":"Very Poor Experience. Our teenage server refused to serve my wife last night...Funny thing is we didnt ever try to order a drink yet and she gave no explaination why she was refusing us. I had 5x more to drink before we got there and she was going to serve me...The maagers were not helpful at all and the waitress actually agrued with me infront of the managers. Yet there were people all around yelling and standing on the tables and banging on the walls and they were being served beer after beer. The staff was not helpful neither was the rent a cop outside. Very rude staff....Customer service is not their strong point...I have contacted Corporate about this situation as well...."}
{"text":"It kind of feels like you are walking into a school cafeteria, but I don't mind it. I guess that's an aspect of German restaurants. I came here in December so no one was sitting outside but it looks like there is plenty of seating outside for the warmer months. I like that the waitresses are in costume. It helps authenticate the experience, as much as you can in Ohio...  Menu items are a little pricey but they have good deals on beer. A large stein was about $5. Soft pretzels are a must! Parking is tricky. You either have to park at a metered spot on the street or valet, as with most places downtown."}
{"text":"We came here the Tuesday before Christmas Eve.  We sat in the back dining room since the wait time was longer to sit in the main hall. I think we waited about 15 minutes to get a first come first serve seat (anywhere) which I didn't think was terrible. 

Our waitress was on her toes and gave us her recommendations prior to ordering. We both had tall Hefe Weizen beers. They were delicious. For the liter it was $11 a piece; so not too crazy priced for giant beers bigger than your face.

I ordered the Schweinsbraten mit Kruste (pot roast with sauerkraut and pototoes) and i thought it was cooked perfectly. My boyfriend ordered the J√§gerschnitzel (breaded pork cutlet with mushroom sauce and spatzle (like a small gnocchi pasta)). 

We both licked our plates clean.  The final check was expensive since entrees are over 16 dollars a pop, but the food reminded me of a home cooked meal. We both waddled out of the door. I would definitely go back to try some of the other food options since I really enjoyed what I had."}
{"text":"Food was good. The establishment is smaller than the one in Pittsburgh but still a great atmosphere. Waiter was friendly felt bad for him though. He was running the bar with 4 guests and waiting on us while the other waitstaff had one party each. Food was served in a timely manner. Restrooms were clean both men and women."}
{"text":"This place is the wurst. Get it? There's hundreds of kinds of German sausage and it seems as though this establishment would have them all on the menu if there was room for them in the kitchen.

We visited here for the first time the other day, and I have to say it was an impressive operation. It's a giant (50 feet by 80 feet by my estimation), clean facility with enthusiastic staff and great music. In my opinion, the food and beer are great, but this place isn't about Michelin stars and fine quisine, it's about fun, and it certainly is that!

Lots of people will have bad stories about this place, but I'd bet you that those who are disappointed fall into two categories: 1) those who are expecting this to be like a standard restaurant experience (which it is not) and 2) those have been to Germany and experienced \"the real thing\" and are forever spoiled by having survived an authentic bacchanal Bavarian bash.  

The first group will constantly attempt to flag down a server about their food temperatures, getting more ice water, bread rolls, and refills on soft drinks. They'll roll their eyes constantly about the fact that they didn't get a table all to themselves, and they'll probably say it's too loud, and that there aren't enough wines on the menu.

The second group is going to continually say, \"When I was in Munich they did this twice as good,\" and, \"the sauerkraut in Berlin was flavored with Juniper, so this isn't very authentic.\" They might wax poetic about how the inn they stayed at in Oberammergau had warmest, softest dampfnudel in the entire world.

Most of these two groups won't return, which leaves more pretzels, schnitzel, spatzle, Bratwurst, dunkel, and polka for the rest of us. If you go into it expecting to stand around for a while, rub elbows with complete strangers, yell to hear your table mates, drink LOTS of beer, and load up on carbohydrates, you'll love it. And honestly, in the context of a big never-ending German festival, these activities are all a blast, especially because it's *Cleveland*.

If you're in the area, you have to try it at least once, and if you don't want to stand in a long line to eat, plan accordingly. There are ominously large tents arranged out front for those who didn't, which obviously fill with snaking lines of germanophiles who simultaneously decided to show up for breaded pork cutlets and potato salad. Alternatively, if you come for lunch on a week day you can probably park across the street and walk right in, chug a liter of light lager and inhale a pretzel, and out in 30 minutes, with a designated drive of course."}
{"text":"So far, not a happy customer.  I am only able to give this rating in regards to the reservations I made.  I made reservations for a bigger party (14 people) and had these reservations well over one month in advance.  I received a phone message today letting me know that my reservations are to be canceled and to call the Hofbrauhaus back.  I have called 4 times with no answer and was finally transferred to the hostess desk to be greeted by a voicemail.  I am not pleased with the fact I have been canceled on for such a large reservation for an important event.  I am also upset that I received this info by voicemail without an explanation and have yet to actually get in touch with the restaurant to understand what the meaning is.  As of right now, I have no desire to ever make a reservation or even stop by this place for a drink.  Hopefully, this will be cleared up and I can change this review to a better one - but I believe first impressions are important."}
{"text":"The portions are large but you pay for it. The room is loud but fun. Don't expect to have any real conversations but if you are there for a meal and a good time it's OK. I would go back again (been there twice) but with friends and not colleagues. My biggest peeve was the \"Bavarian Cream Puff\" that did not actually contain Bavarian cream. Bavarian cream is a classic recipe and this was instead filled with a whipped pre-made product meant to resemble whipped cream. Need to change the name of this dessert. Everyone of the 6 people in my party thought it was gross."}
{"text":"This is exactly what you think it will be. A huge, loud, crowded party. A band plays traditional and classic rock hits while people swing large mugs of beer around and dance on the tables. 

But despite having to yell to talk, the beer was great, the gigantic soft pretzel was delicious (so were the cream puff and sauerkraut balls my friends ordered), and our server was super helpful, even though he seemed swamped. 

Loved it. Definitely a good place to go early and stay a long time."}
{"text":"The food is an A and the bier an A+, but the service is soooo unorganized it ruins the good parts."}
{"text":"Average of 3 stars? Crazy. The atmosphere is a real brewery/restaurant with an Oktoberfest flair consisting of picnic tables, and German ensemble. The beer is made in house and the \"brewery\" behind the bar. Beers come in several sizes from shot (sample) to liter. 

For dinner, I ordered the Brotzeitteiler which is an assortment of meats and various accoutrements. Much larger than expected, I only managed a small dent into the protein mountain of deliciousness in front of me. 

A German style band plays on the stage. Seemingly mostly Polka bands, but as the drinks flow it gets to be more fun. 

Parking is conveniently across the street. What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Daughter came in for a visit from L.A. and she has never been here before. Stopped in for lunch on Sunday 7/22/17. Much to our surprise and delight they went to a buffet instead of off the menu. It was our understanding that having the buffet on Sunday's was relatively new. It was Awesome! $21.95/person. Lots of things off the menu and even some stuff that isn't on the menu. Sauerbraten, Bratwurst, Prime Rib,  soft pretzels, Spatzel, potatoes, sausages & sauerkraut, Perogies, broiled Cod, salad & fruit station, dessert station featuring German Chocolate cake among other wonderful sweets. Schnitzel was not on the buffet but it is included, you just have to ask your server for it. Drinks are not included. However, if you have your heart set on their delicious Saurkraut balls, well, they won't be available. My recommendation would be to go early because you never know when the Theatre Districts matinee shows will let out and the food lines can get extremely long. PROST!"}
{"text":"It's Friday night and I go to the Q to watch our Monsters crush the Ontario Reign and afterwards wander over to the Hofbrauhaus House and the first thing I hear is great music, the first thing I see are people dancing on the seats and it's happening, very cool, much fun but then I find out they're showing the original 1968 film \"Night of the Living Dead\" and so here I go, after a few glitches with the sound the movie comes on, it's a good crowd watching and we're all drinking great beer and other beverages, making comments and having a great time and I'm having another perfect night of merriment in downtown Cleveland and now the Hofbrauhaus is on my list of cool places to go and have great fun."}
{"text":"I've gone here with a group of friends a handful of times now and have had nothing short of a great night every time. Sure, it's loud and can feel like a high school cafeteria at times. But the energy in the room is so alive it's hard to not get into the spirit of things. The beers come in 2 sizes, pint and liter if I'm not mistaken, and shot skis are available. Not sure on the pint, but the liter is $20 and can obviously last awhile (I'm holding it in my profile picture). I've never ordered from the menu so I can't comment on that, but I can say the beer selection is pretty great. My only tips are to go in a big group of friends for the full experience and get there all together and early as the line can get long and you can't save table space for late arrivals."}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere- when the entire room starts singing, you know it's going to be a fun night.  

Beer was very good, as was the food.  Our server  (Katie P) was awesome, and all the servers seemed to enjoy their jobs.  

Just remember- you can stand on the benches, just not the tables.  :)"}
{"text":"Terrible experience!  Took 30 for our server to come to our table, the waiter botched up our order. Took 1 1/2 hours for our food to arrive, and when the food came, it was cold. The food was over priced and was not great. Service was VERY poor. The band is way too loud and it was impossible to carry out a conversation. I do NOT recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"The overall experience of the Hofbrauhaus is one that will keep you wanting to come back. 

I've been here 3 times now and am planning a 4th trip.

First time- I was part of the Lincoln Park Pub Santa Crawl and we stopped here. We waited outside for a few minutes and the manager let us up to a private room where  a polka band was playing. It was a beautiful room, they did an excellent job with the interior of this space!

The second time I brought my parents in after a Lolly the Trolley tour. It was the most fun I'd seen them have in ages. They both climbed up on the beer hall bench and clapped along with the crowd. As I swung by beer back and forth, Mom was reminded  of her youth- the polkas, the accordion. 

Service is always great and prices are fair. The food is delicious and I enjoy the authentic menu. I can't wait to try something new.

I wish they took reservations for a large group, but we're gonna try to get all of us in anyway! Check it out- you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"As a American of heavily German decent, I love his place I went to the original in Munich. The Cleveland house is affordable and very tasty, I enjoyed my time there Prost to you guys I wish I could work here honestly."}
{"text":"Quick thank you to Hofbrauhaus Cleveland. My family and I ate there yesterday evening after attending a performance at the theater. The staff was very accommodating to our son's needs and did a great job seating us alone once we told them about his issues.
It's a very small thing, but it allowed us to enjoy our meal as a family. Thanks!! 
Also- your braunschweiger was off the charts good!"}
{"text":"This is what happens when you combine a German beer hall and a bunch of Americans appetite for booze.  Us Americans do everything faster and louder.  I've been to Hofbr√§uhaus in Munich, as well as Cincinnati and Columbus, and leave it to Cleveland to make it wild.  Granted it was a Saturday night and the Buckeyes were on, but the place was slammed, servers were running around completely overwhelmed, and drunk people everywhere.

So you may ask why I rated it 4 stars? Well, because this is kind of what I expected.  I should also add that the food was freaking amazing and I need to go on a German food diet, if that's a thing...if not, it should be.  The perch was seasoned and fried perfectly.  The pierogis were delicious, especially with sour cream, and the sauerkraut balls were the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Not bad. Seems a bit disorganized. Staff came over to us within 5 minutes of us sitting down trying to blame us for putting our feet on the table. It was the women next to us doing it when we didnt even know them. Food was pretty good but they do not treat the customers right from what I saw. Before even sitting down we got an attitude from a server about where to sit. They wont last long in Cleveland if that continues. We all know those hangouts dont make it here."}
{"text":"I went to Hofbrauhaus the day after it opened with a group of colleagues for A beer (one beer).  Several hours later, I finally got a ride home.  We had a blast! The atmosphere is fun and boisterous and feels authentic.  I'm German American and enjoy Oktoberfest at the local club with my family and visiting Hofbrauhaus feels like Oktoberfest every day!  The beer is great!  The band and singing and dancing on tables makes it fun for a group.  I'm glad we got there early, because it was packed.  I liked the festival seating and our service was fantastic!  I didn't order food, but snacked on some tasty pretzels.  Others at our table enjoyed their meals.  I will update my review when I get the chance to eat there.

Prost!"}
{"text":"We had my bachelorette party here and it was a ton of fun. The food was great and the drinks were plenty. We danced on the tables and they even had a special polka just for me. We did a bunch of ski shots. We had a blast! It is good for all ages as well."}
{"text":"I was not expecting this to be good seeing as it looks like a huge tourist trap. It is clean inside which is very unlike the tents in Munich during Octoberfest. I ordered the pierogies with sausage that began with M. It was very good. The pierogies were pan fried and had extra seasoning on it that rendered them delicious little pockets of potato and cheese. The Bavarian cream puff was okay. That is my only complaint. As a visitor of Cleveland, I'm glad I stopped here."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Awesome vibe and a blast. Definitely worth stopping in. Sauerkraut balls were delicious! The liter of beers are also a plus. Stopped in on a Sunday by word of mouth, and the place was rocking with a live band that was hilarious. Only downside is it's a bit pricey, but Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Dieser \"Hofbr√§uhaus\" ist ein Hofbr√§uhaus nur wenn Bielefeld ist eine Stadt. Solange das Bier ist lecker, die Atmosph√§re ist nicht wie man nach dem Besuch Hofbr√§uhaus in M√ºnchen und Berlin erwartet.

Die Live-Musik war nicht unterhaltsam und die Musiker hat desungen Happy Birthday (auf Englisch) drei mal f√ºr drei andere Menschen in der Zeit ich dort war. Das war mehr als die Lied, die auf Deutsch waren.

F√ºr Essen ich bestellt Zwiebelringen und Hofbrau Kartoffelsalat, und mein Freund bestellt die Reuben Sandwich. Die Kartoffelsalat war so-so und die Zweibelringe war nicht lecker. Aber mein Freund genoss die Reuben.

Eine andere Sache ich nicht mochte, war dass der Service war  langsam. Mein Freund fragte nach Wasser und der Server hat nicht bringen, und wir mussen einen anderen Server danach fragen.


If you prefer English:
This \"Hofbrauhaus\" is as much a Hofbrauhaus as Bielefeld is a city. While the beer is still great, the entire atmosphere is nothing like one would expect after visiting Hofbrauhaus in Munich and Berlin.

The live music was not entertaining and I heard them sing Happy birthday (In English, not German) 3 times for 3 different people in the time I was there. This was more than the number of songs that were in German. 

For food I got onion rings and a side of Hofbrau Potato Salad, and my friend got the Reuben Sandwich. The Potato Salad was nothing special but not bad, the onion rings were huge but not tasty. My friend did enjoy the Reuben though.

Another thing I found irksome was that the service was extremely slow. My friend asked for water and the server didn't bring it, so we had to ask another server for it."}
{"text":"Cool place with a cool patio, and even more going on if you are planning to dine inside. 

We stopped here on a Saturday afternoon when the weather was perfect so we decided to hang outside. They have an outdoor bar area that you can wait in line to get your liter beer and pretzel fix on. There is also a line if you are planning to wait for a table inside... to be honest this whole line situation is incredibly confusing and if we hadn't been with some pros we would have likely gotten lost or had to ask where to go. It's not so clear which line to stand in for what, so that could be improved.

Their beer selection is delicious and that's all I can say for now. I will have to return to try their food, but their patio is where it's at on a nice day!

Oh! And I did hear one host ask someone if they had reservations, so apparently that's something they offer as well."}
{"text":"Eh, I guess this is what you get from a international chain. 

The Good - the live bands. They are always enjoyable and fun. Who doesn't want to sit with a 100 strangers and sing polka songs and dance on tables! I know I do! 

The Bad - their food and wait. Widely known fact, they are always busy on weekends and have hours long waits. Tip - Make a reservation or come late afternoon! 
The food also tends to be hit or miss. This past visit my group ordered the giant pretzel (stale,stale,stale), the sauerkraut balls (delicious!), the OBATZDA (yummy), the pierogies (Mrs. T, skip), and J√ÑGERSCHNITZEL (okay, HUGE portion). Needless to say I wouldn't come here solely for the food. 

The Ugly - service. The service and waitstaff seems to be non exist. Almost every times I've come here we have had the same 1 or 2 problems, sometimes both during the same visit. The first - it takes forever to order anything weather it be drinks or a meal. The second - the waiter/ess disappears down the rabbit hole! This past visit it took 15 minute after we were seated before he even showed up so we could place a drink order and another 15 to get the drinks that were delivered by someone else. An additional 20 minutes after our drinks to flag him down to order food and then another 35 minutes before our food was delivered. In the almost 2 hours we were there we only saw our original waiter twice!! This was also during the week and around 5:30, so they we NOT busy. No wonder the wait to be seated during the weekend is so long!!"}
{"text":"This was a fun night out complete with live music. The songs were all pretty familiar, sing-along type songs. 

I'd definitely go back, though you have to be in the mood for it as it's unlike any bar I've been to before. Everything happens in one big room so you are in the thick of the action whether you want to be or not. The action is a lively mix of singing, tipping shot skis, chanting and revelers dancing on the bench seating. 

The only food I tried was an order of pretzels. They were fine, but they barely had any salt on them.

Our server was fine. She came around at all the right times to offer more drinks."}
{"text":"This review doesn't include eating at the restaurant-- I've never actually ordered food there. 

The experience, however, is always 5 stars. The music is always great and fun, plus who doesn't love standing on the tables and dancing? It's normal here!! 

Shotskis for the brace sets of 4 friends, huge steins full of beer, and a full bar otherwise gives you a night out to remember. The lager is great-- you can't go wrong with any of their drink offerings. 

If you're going with a big party, expect a bit of a wait, but it's well worth it and your whole party can stay together in one place! So much fun. Can't wait to come again."}
{"text":"Good beer, not the strongest drinks (sorry, I don't drink beer :(  )  and the food looked pretty good - I only ate some part of a pretzel but did not get any cheese sauce.  Boo!  

I hear the schnitzel is great - I am totally willing to go back to try it!  I really like the atmosphere. And I want to hear the bands play!"}
{"text":"Disappointed, larger beer does not taste fresh and is metallic in the aroma, tastes like a somewhat fresh traveled, imported keg of Hof Brau. The hefeweizen was decent but the Dunkel really missed the stylistic mark except for the color. I was always under the impression that they had a German Brew Master come in to make sure the beers were on point when opening a new location in the U.S. I would really question if this has happened in Cleveland. The beers are much much better at the Pittsburgh location.  Also, bring my appetizer before the entree and lower the prices, ouch!!!"}
{"text":"Although it's not close to other restaurants/bars, it's a great atmosphere and good food and drink as well! Their performers are often very entertaining. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They have plenty of indoor and outdoor seating as well as parking areas designated for Hofbrauhaus patrons."}
{"text":"Last night we went there looking forward to listen to some good polka music.  This was the third Wednesday in a row that we had gone there. Previously, it was so fun! Great bands and lots of good energy. Unfortunately last night was horrible! The guy on the accordion had a terrible voice and we could hardly hear him. He was singing Beatles songs and Jimmy Buffett,???? Why would you go to a German place to hear the Beatles or Jimmy Buffett? 
In the future I will check to make sure that guy is not performing."}
{"text":"Sad to see all the bad reviews. We tried this place a couple weeks ago. Pretzels with beer cheese-excellent. Sausage and Burger-also great. Drinks a little on the pricey side but they were refreshing. 
Would love to go back with a large group. The place is beautiful inside."}
{"text":"Food is bad, and their in house beer is mediocre. Go for the atmosphere, not for what they serve."}
{"text":"This is not just a brewery it is Munich comes to life.   They are dancing in the isles and on the tables.  The beer is excellent german quality.   I'm shocked at how good it is.  It's 22 out and they serve outdoor biergarten.   Dedicated !   Get a reservation!"}
{"text":"Beer is delicious....but didn't eat. We had a large party and called weeks in advance and was assured that they had such a large seating area that no reservations would be needed......2 hours later while having a conversation with a woman who was seating people and identified herself as one of the owners I learned that they refuse to allow reservations in their main dining area for large parties because \"they have a tendency to stay for hours\".  After suggesting that her staff let large parties know that they will likely have to wait for a long time to be seated she said that she was done talking to me.  .....I threw my near full beer near the trash outside the door and left. Most of my parties stayed but I guarantee that most will never go back, myself included."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago for my wife's birthday.  Also went here for my birthday last year.  Had a good time so the wife wanted to try this again.  I'll focus my review mainly on our visit a few days ago.

I called a week ahead to make the reservation.  I understand it was a Friday and would be busy.  Only times available was 5:30 or 8.  We went with 5:30.  I honestly don't understand why we couldn't get a reservation at 6 or even 6:30.  When we left at around 6:30 half the beer hall was empty.  The people working the host/hostess area was not friendly at all.  Acted like they were doing us a favor by just being there.

Service at our table was ok.  Somewhat slow, but not great, either.  I sat at a bench in the beer hall with some guy that must have been 400-500 pounds behind me.  Every time I moved I kept brushing into his body fat.  It was pretty annoying.  Only time I didn't like the beer hall setup at this place. 

We ordered the sauerkraut balls.  They arrived hot, tender, with what looks like small bits of meat mixed in the middle.  Served with a honey mustard sauce on the side it was pretty good.  I ordered the hunter style wienrschnitzel for my dinner.  It was a piece of wienerschnitzel with a mushroom sauce, bacon, and fried onion straws on top.  Cranberry sauce was on the side.  It was good, but came to the table a touch cold.

Before leaving for home I got a growler.  I should have asked how much a growler fill was.  $24.99.  Don't get me wrong.  German beer is good.  It's not $24.99 growler fill good.  At most that growler should have cost $12.

The atmosphere is fun.  But it is highly dependent on the band that is playing.  The band playing Friday night got maybe 1 table into their music.  And I think they sang my wife happy birthday.  We told our server it was her birthday and she said the band would sing.  But I'm not real sure.  My mom said they said her name before singing happy birthday.  I'm not so sure.

This place has the potential to be outstanding with a few minor service tweaks.  Otherwise, it will always be average at best."}
{"text":"I did not enjoy this place, it's pretty much a giant gimmick. On the plus side, the spaetzels were pretty good, and the beers are priced well for their size. However, the rest of the evening was a flop. I was there with a fairly large party that spanned 2 tables, we had one server, which seemed standard. The server will take your name with your order, but I'm not sure it really helped. She was constantly coming up to the table with food and drinks we didn't order and when everyone's food did come out it was hard to hear what it was and they didn't use the names. The food was cold.  My fiance's pretzel was stale (another person ordered the pretzel and it was soft, so I know they weren't supposed to be hard as rocks). He also never got the pierogies he ordered. My chicken breast was dry and slightly burnt. After receiving food the server never came back to check on us, so we couldn't tell her we didn't get the pierogies and couldn't order more drinks. We had to ask for the check about an hour later after grabbing her as she walked by. 

I could sort of see why someone would like the atmosphere as it is conductive to drinking, standing on benches, and \"dancing.\" But as someone below pointed out, it's a bunch of older people trying desperately hard to relive their college days. People stand on the benches and you're basically watching their butts sway back and forth.  It is very loud so don't expect conversation. I would consider going back if I were looking for this type of experience and the service was good, but given the fact that the service is terrible I probably won't return, there are a million other places to get beer in Cleveland that don't feel like Disney World.

Oh and the 5k/10k they host every year stinks too."}
{"text":"Thursday night the tables were nearly full. Polka band was playing. Lots of nice vibes. Big place. Nice people. Busy. Beer comes in liters or halves. Dinners are filling. Desserts are huge. Order the Black Forest cake and share with three others. Lots of parking if you drive around to find it."}
{"text":"Had reservations for 9pm on a weeknight.  Band was closing up and the only oom pah music was in the restroom.  Sad.  Food was ok at best.  Beers were very tasty though.  In my opinion, Sterle's is much better."}
{"text":"This a great place to go with friends!  Conveniently located in Cleveland it provides a perfect place for food and beer!  Love the theme.  You definitely need to check it out!  Always a fun time!"}
{"text":"Ok, so this place JUST opened.   We walked up and could hear the band beckoning us from Chester Ave.  when we rounded the corner though, we got a glimpse of the line we had to stand in.  While waiting in line, we had a server come up and wait on us, so we could have beer in hand-she took credit cards and everything.  The line was, oh...20-30 minutes and then we got sat at a big wooden table, 6 people to a side.  We had great table mates, but we were a little crammed in.  
Service was superb!  Everyone is dressed in lederhosen and quipped jokes and encouraged us to dance and stand on the table.  I was glad when our table mates declined-phew!
Anyway, sauerkraut balls were awesome.  The sausages are skinnier than Id expected, but were good and added to the atmosphere.  Prices we're reasonable and the warm pretzels for $2.50 looked like a necessary evil to the huuuge Hofbrau beers we were served.
Great for groups.  Raucous atmosphere.  Great beer!"}
{"text":"The food here is not that great. The valet staff was rude! Only good thing about this place is the beer and atmosphere. Fun place to go in the winter when it's cold and you don't feel like bar hopping. Don't bother eating here with the food being too pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is lively and great. Fun for large groups! Our server was very friendly and accommodating to our group. Unfortunately, the food is blah. There was no one in our group of 20 who raved about the food. Super disappointing. 

I've had the pretzels and bier cheese at the Columbus location and thought they were really good, but this night, the \"soft\" pretzels were more stale than anything. 

The sampler platter seemed promising because I wanted to try a bunch of different things. The sauerkraut balls were the best thing in the platter. The onion rings and pickles were WAY too breaded and we found ourselves taking the breading off. 

The sausages were okay and the breaded fish was bland and not very good at all. 

If I do visit again, it'll be for the beer and atmosphere! The shotskis were fun. A shotski is where 4 shot glasses are attached to a ski. You get up on the bench and take the shot with 3 other people at the same time. Guests cheer you on and clap.. It's fun! Limited shot selection for the shotski though."}
{"text":"This is the most fun place in town. A party every night. You could come by yourself and have a blast. The wait was 2 1/2 hours in a Saturday, but worth it. On weekdays, there isn't a edit but there is still fun"}
{"text":"I was so excited for this to open and was hesitant after reading some reviews but I finally went and loved it!  I think there are some issues because it is new, it is popular, and it gets crazy on Fridays and Saturdays. I went on Sunday and still had to wait in a line but it went quickly and wasn't and issue. I think in time it will get more efficient on busy days. Service was great, our food was surprisingly good, beer was tasty, and the place is just fun!  Definitely feels like Oktoberfest with the great German band they had playing. I look forward to coming back in the summer when the outside area is all open.  If you can, check out the Hermit Club portion of the complex. A very cool historic building that fits perfectly with the Hofbrauhaus!"}
{"text":"Lackluster food. Lackluster special shots. Very expensive good time. I had the chicken schnitzel and it was just a regular chicken sandwich not even flat. I would return just for the drinks. It is a very fun restaurant though. Very expensive, I can't stress that enough."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim. As many of the other reviews have said, the service was not great. A bit slow and the place wasn't even close to full... but at least the servers were friendly. 
We had the pretzel basket. Really the pretzels and cheese dips tasted like the were out of a package. 
Also had the reuben for dinner. Also not great. 
The place was loud, but that would be ok for a night of drinking, but the atmosphere wasn't warm. I just kinda felt like I was sitting in a warehouse. 
Also the prices are high. The pretzels with the dipping sauces was like $14!

If you are looking for a long night of beer drinking, this place is for you. Also would probably be good with a large group of people. 
If you are looking for a good meal and conversation. you should move on."}
{"text":"I am only basing my review to the CLE Hofbrauhaus on one visit  since I have only been there once. However, my hubby and I have been to Pittsburgh, Las Vegas, and Cincinnati as well, and had wonderful experiences there, too! My husband has also visited the one in Munich, Germany and I am very envious.

Went to Hofbrauhaus late on a Friday night in the late fall/early winter. It was 10:30 and the line was out the door! It was freezing cold outside but my group and I decided to wait it out. It is much easier to do that too when there is an outdoor bar ready to serve you while you wait in line! Love it! After about 30 minutes we made it in the doors, and ten more minutes got us a table. Service was good, I don't expect fantastic service at any restaurant when it is super busy like it was that night. Not that it was bad - it wasn't. I'd just like to go back during more normal dinner hours to experience the service then, too.

I got a soft pretzel as a snack but the main reason we were there was for the beer. The beer was delicious, I think the gals tried the more traditional lighter beer and the guys got a dark beer. We had so much fun that night -- the live band was incredible and the whole place was rockin! I think we even stood on our chairs a few times - the band really got the crowd into it. A must visit place in CLE!"}
{"text":"This is definitely a destination place rather than for the food. I've been here three times now and food is average but if you want to have a good time with a big group, you can't beat it. 

Don't go for the food, go for the beer and singing and dancing"}
{"text":"I've been back multiple times since writing my original review and honestly, I'll be back many many more times moving forward. The overall experience with the live band and the energy in the beer hall on weekends makes it a blast. I love the beer and taking shot skis!! And, there are a few items on the menu that I absolutely love and will go back for. 

So, why am I dropping them down a star? The service is ALWAYS slow. Like, consistently ridiculously slow. They've had months and months since opening to hire on more staff if they think that's what needs to be done, but unfortunately, nothing has improved. 

I'm still excited for the patio opening soon! At least the beer will be \"self serve\" and you won't need to wait around for someone else to grab your drinks! 

Like I said - I still love hofbrauhaus - I would just love it even more if the service was better."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this review is long overdue!  I'm just trying to play catch up here. :-P

A lot of Yelpers have ragged on das Hofbrauhaus mainly for the service, but I love this place!  I've been here a few times and I've never had a bad experience, even when it was super packed, which is very often!  There's a line to get in on the weekends, so be prepared.

I know this is a national chain and like most Yelpers, I prefer to stick to the local places, but I really enjoy the food (and drink) and ambiance here.  
The schnitzel is lightly seasoned, pounded out thin, and fried to a tender golden brown.  The sides they offer are good, but nothing special.  The pierogies were very good and filling, but I think I prefer the ones at Sokolowski's over HBH's. My brother in law raved about how good the sauerkraut balls were before this place even opened. I've had them on two separate occasions, and I must say I agree...they are fantastic!  They're filled with a mixture of corned beef and sauerkraut and fried up til firm and oh so scrumptious!  Put these golf ball-sized bundles of joy into your mouth and you'll see what I'm talking about!  Nomnomnom! The honey mustard dipping sauce pairs well with these balls.  The giant pretzels with beer cheese are great too!  After seeing all the pics of the ginormous bier battered onion rings, I'll be sure to try them next time!  

The beer (bier) hall here is really fun! There's always live bands playing polka or your favorite German tunes and it makes for a hip, family-friendly atmosphere.  Singing along and dancing on the benches is definitely encouraged.  I love me some Chicken Dance!  I'm not a beer connoisseur  by any means, but the beer (brewed in-house) is really good.  Dunkel is favorite!  Oh, and if you come with a group, you have to try the shot skis!

The wait staff is attentive and friendly. The ladies where these little ensembles that bare a lot of cleavage and the men wear traditional German Lederhosen! Love it!  Like I mentioned, Yelpers have complained about poor service, but I guess I've been lucky and have had pretty good service each time I've gone, although it takes a bit longer to receive your food when it's a madhouse. (Duh)

I'm looking forward to my next visit to Hofbrauhaus!  Prost!"}
{"text":"Not too pleased with HBCle.

Someone got me a gift card for HB. I checked on their website to learn about the place... looked at the menu... checked the hours... checked the events page... and invited friends to join us there.

When we got there the hostess told us it was only a buffet because it was Sunday. On the website is listed the buffet as ending at 6. Online it said full menu also available. It was both after 6... and the hostess most certainly said they only had the buffet. I asked what was on the buffet. The hostess said there was a list of foods on the website. I had not seen such a list on their website. Also,  I'm standing in the restaurant - why tell me to go on the internet? They never offered for us to look at the buffet which I thought would have been an obvious thing to do. Since my friend was a vegetarian and we could not discover what was on the buffet... we thought we would see what was available outside, which has a limited menu. 

stupidly... outside you cannot use a gift card.

we left. Inexplicably there was some sort of puppy adoption going on with puppys running underfoot and happy people watching the puppys and not looking where they were going. :D :D Hah! I liked the puppies. I would like to rate the puppies -  6 stars.

 i sent an email to the restaurant asking if the food could be paid for inside with the gc and just obtained outside... no response. 

It looks really nice in there and i hope you enjoy it but we were perplexed. The management should have better info on the website about what is going on. and a gift card should be accepted at the whole establishment. A business should also respond to questions. 

I've been to the Hofbraukeller in Munich and didn't expect this to be similar, but I do like things to make sense. Still it is a nice addition to CLE and playhouse square. Best wishes to it anyway and I hope you try it and enjoy it. It did look like they had some nice happy hour specials and special hours on certain days."}
{"text":"Not sure why the poor reviews on the food? The food was excellent. We got the GIANT soft pretzel and beer cheese to start- AMAZING! For our meals we had the veal schnitzel and corned beef reuben. Both were phenomenal. It's a fun and very loud atmosphere. Prices are on the higher side. Want to check this place out again."}
{"text":"What a fun new venue near downtown CLE that really get the crowds out of their little cliques and enjoy music food and of course beers. Situated next to CSU, one of their downfalls is lack of a dedicated parking lot. This place can hold like 300 people and they have the option to valet for $15 or vie for street parking across the street. Live bands and wait staff encourage dancing in the aisles and table tops and even provide the words to the songs and short routines. Beer sizes come in huge and omg huge. Lots of carbs and fried feasting. Particularly enjoyed sauerkraut balls and goulash soup. Hall kind of reminds of the dining hall in hogwarts. Gets super crowded on fri an sat nights come early or wait outside for a long while but at least  there's a bar outside to keep you buzzing"}
{"text":"Fun spot! Great food! Definite return trip! Great music! First night of our trip to Cleveland. GR8 part of the \"Brews Cruise\" tour!"}
