{"text":"Ate here with the Bros. Cheap menu....dagum good breakfast. Good weather. They had EPL [English Premier League] which was dope. I gave it four stars because they don't have bottomless mimosas. Bring pappy a bottomless mimosa and I'll add the extra star amigo!"}
{"text":"When asking locals \"where is the best place to eat?\" We weren't expecting to get directed to this hole-in-the-wall little joint. With flashiness all around, we would have easily overlooked the little black door tucked away into the building. When we walked in, the ambiance was artsy, the drink specials were awesome, and the menu was to the point and full of goodness.  I got the Market Steak sandwich (YES. It is AMAZING.) With Chili-Mac on the side. You will think that it's just macaroni and cheese, but the way they make the noodles al-dente and have such a buttery cheese sauce with perfect chili... you cannot pass it up. Don't fall for the gimmicks of murals and colors... this may look like a plain little section of NoDa but it was a highlight of my trip. I will be back."}
{"text":"If I could rate less than a one, I would! My first time here. I was a solo diner so I sat at the bar. The bartender tells me that I cannot order any food for 30 minutes. I went there for breakfast. They are clearly still making breakfast in the kitchen as I can see the cooks. I understand the transition to lunch but to sit and can't order any food for 30 minutes is ridiculous! Spoke to the manger about it and  she asserts breakfast ends at 12:59. Yeah ok, so I should have been literally 30 seconds earlier.  All I wanted to do was sit down,  drink a mimosa and eat a scrambled egg... I guess 30 seconds eliminated that's possibility. (The rules are the rules). Just wish that had it posted on their website that you must be there by 12:59 to get breakfast. Never again!"}
{"text":"Divey locals bar in a cute little village area. Bartender and patrons super friendly! Lots of beer choices! BURGERS EXCELLENT!!! A must try! The chili was very good with a small kick to it. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Never Again...

Not a busy Saturday afternoon, and after an hour of waiting for our food, the server magically realized the kitchen \"lost our ticket\".  

I am not someone that would have waited an hour to say something, but after taking our order we did not have the server bother to stop at the table to ask if I wanted another beer or even refill a water glass.  In fact, we never even got a refill on the water never mind a second beer. 

I would have gone as far to ask to speak to the manager but she was too busy dancing around the back door eating her food after the server pointed at my table to tell her what had happened.

Needless to say, I was not surprised when the check came and nothing was adjusted to reflect the experience..."}
{"text":"Solid menu, interesting people watching. Kinda wish I'd had an easier time getting the attention of the wait staff, but, eh: Friday in NoDa - what are you gonna do? Suck it up, buttercup -they're cooler than you anyhow. 

I will say the turf & turf burger was damned good, though. Mmmm!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Jack's this morning and it was terrific. The biscuits and gravy were the best I've ever had in North Carolina!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went to Jack Beagles this weekend. I've lived in Charlotte for 6 years and this was the first time I'd come here for breakfast, instead of a late-night brew. I got the sh!t.... basically steak on toast. So freaking good. Whoever said it was acceptable to eat steak for breakfast was a smart person."}
{"text":"I was strolling around NoDa after some meetings and was looking to cop a hearty lunch with a cold adult beverage. I walked into Jack Beagles and sat at the bar. It was a very inviting atmosphere and the staff was friendly. As I checked out the menu, I noticed that they gave many of the dishes colorful nicknames. I thought to myself, this concept can either create a local legend or go horribly awry. At that very moment, I saw a cheesesteak they offered called \"the stugots\", which is Italian slang for a variation of \"stu cazz\" or \"stu cazzo\" i.e. \"My d**k\" or \"my balls\", or \"my d**k AND my balls\"; terms used interchangeably to express ones defiance or disbelief in something or someone (courtesy translation for the ethnically challenged). Needless to say, I had the cajones to order the stugots. I asked the chef to add green peppers as they were not listed in the menu description. He balked at the idea for a second, but then threw a few on the grill with the onions, steak and pepperoni as per my request. The result...boom. It kicked off like a loose forward. I have since drastically reduced the amount of red meat in my diet. If you are likewise, they offer it with chicken as a no-cost substitute.They have a pretty good beer selection as well."}
{"text":"They have really solid pub grub and an interesting beer list. The menu is simple and made up of appetizers, burgers, hot dogs and cheesesteak sandwiches, but each of these has a few nice twists (smoked hot dogs, burger with humus, etc.) and they're all made very nicely. The owner is often around and will check in on you to see how your meal has been, which is nice, too."}
{"text":"Food was so disappointing - hummus tasted like it was a about to go bad and read good reviews about Mac and cheese and burgers but the Mac did not have any favor and burger is beyond greasy. I really wanted to like this place - maybe they had a new cook but will not go back"}
{"text":"I love love love this place.  Great atmosphere, live music, and great beer selection.  Even with all of that my favorite thing will always be the Jack Mac.  The best mac' n cheese I could ask for!!"}
{"text":"Definitely a \"hidden gem\" in Charlotte!  I've walked by this place many times on my way to other restaurants in NoDa, but never stopped in until today (from the outside, it just looks like a dive bar).  My husband and I had lunch here this afternoon, and WOW-everything was really AMAZING!  The Mac n' cheese is by far the best I've had in Charlotte.  I highly recommend the Jack Mac!!  The Hawaiian chicken wrap and boneless wings are also delicious.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, relaxed atmosphere, quick service, excellent beer selection. What else do you want? The Bayou Burger is fantastic."}
{"text":"Just when I thought that NoDa was on the verge of losing its identity, I was introduced to Jack Beagles.  While I hesitate to call JB a \"hole in the wall\" because people might shy away from the place, I want to call it a \"hole in the wall\" with great affection and admiration.  This is your classic neighborhood bar, but with a fantastic beer selection and great food. 

I've only had two food menu items:  the hand-battered corn dog and the fries.  As many other reviewers have said, the fries are more like thick-cut chips and are the most delicious potato I've ever eaten.  I could eat a burlap sack full of them.  I there was a Groupon for \"burlap sack full of Jack Beagles fries\" I would buy it.  

A sample menu of the beers I've had a JB:  Heavy Seas Siren Noire, New Holland Dragon's Milk, Abita Vanilla Porter and Oskar Blues GNIGHT.  Not shabby at all.  Pretty damn good, if you ask me.  

The atmosphere here is nice and has an eclectic mix of people.  But, dammit!  I can't get away from Will Puckett's art in this neighborhood.  His paintings will always make you realize how much better he is than you.  Per the sign in the men's room:  if you see Will, buy him a beer."}
{"text":"I ate here yesterday and she staff and food was awesome I would recommend them. Very nice clean and staff was awesome. The burgers are to die for."}
{"text":"One of the best places to not only grab a bite but enjoy live music as well as excellent service from their staff, specially managers Alexz & Mike!"}
{"text":"Great burger, decent mac. Only complaint is it felt like wind tunnel with fans on and a/c directed right at tables.  Would visit again."}
{"text":"this place consistently makes awesome food. great atmosphere, great prices and best of all, THE BEST Mac m cheese..Try the Jack mac!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's extremely clean and the people are so nice. There are the occasional drunk or two, but stay out of their way and they won't bother you. The food is fresh and cooked as soon as the order is placed. I love the burgers and the chicken fingers are amazing. Try the Mac-n-Cheese too! 

The location is kinda odd, the first time I went there I was meeting friends and I walked by the place a couple of times before realizing that it was right in front of me. It's really laid back and cozy.  The outdoor patio is heated in the winter and has live entertainment.

The prices are really reasonable for an up and coming neighborhood like NoDa. I plan on bring all of my friends here!"}
{"text":"Shit on a shingle is great and brunch gets an A+ in my book. Chill, laid back atmosphere. I describe it to others as \"the bar in NoDa with no sign outside\"."}
{"text":"Came to here to have a beer and ended up eating some food. I had the pork tacos and they were awesome. Very tasty with the mango salsa which gave a sweet taste to the tacos. Will definately be back for a brew and the tacos.

The new outdoor seating area is big and are looking forward to music playing out there this summer."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late Saturday brunch. They weren't too busy but pretty inattentive and annoyed so we left."}
{"text":"Came here one night and was really surprised. They had a wing special (think it was Wednesday and half priced). The wings were perfect did a few shots and called it tonight. Couldn't complain at all! Fast friendly service, awesome price, good food, and nice drinks....I'll give two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, inexpensive, and fun atmosphere.  On one occasion, I took a somewhat large group there last minute and they were very accommodating."}
{"text":"All of their burgers are on point! Love their garlic infused Mac and cheese and their coleslaw, delishhhhh."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food and a great atmosphere. I've sampled most of the menu and haven't been let down yet! My favorite thus far is The Stugot cheesesteak!!!"}
{"text":"We had the fries how you like 'em for an appetizer -- we got chili, onions, and tomatoes -- and the fries were waffle, the chili delicious, and the effect was impressive. Then the burgers came, and they were large, and delicious (decent-sized buns, not those tiny things). And with the burger came the Mac & cheese, and it was surprisingly good (and I'm kind of a mac & cheese snob). So the food was better than I expected, and the prices were reasonable, so I'd say that's a win-win. Now, if only they'd put up ANY sort of a sign outside identifying the place, more people could find it. So if you're in NoDa, check it out, but be sure you have the address."}
{"text":"Pros:
Food was good
Parking was easy to find
Service was good

Cons: 
Mixed drinks were not good. Other reviews mention beer, but we don't like beer. 
It was crowded (because it isn't very big) 
It was hard to find at night, no sign - or if there was one, it wasn't lit up."}
{"text":"The other day i stopped by after hearing good things about their special mac and cheese and beer selection. I highly suggest getting the \"JackMac\", very good. Creamy with a little bit of kick to it, just awesome and very filling. Will be back next time to try something different!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. As a NoDa resident, Jack's Beagles is the only food that I can consistently eat from the restaurants around here. The prices are very reasonable considering the great quality of the food! The pork tacos are ridiculous, all the macaronis are incredible, classic Mac being my favorite, the burgers are delicious, and my god is the widow maker amazing!!"}
{"text":"Terrible first visit. Let it be said this place is incredibly cheap. Great prices and a nice breakfast/brunch menu on sat and Sunday. That is where it stops. Arrived at 12:45 on a Sunday. Sat and waited... and waited... and waited. Finally. After getting a menu craving some brunch I ordered a beer and... waited. Food order finally taken at 1:15 only for the server to come back and tell us that they stop brunch at 1pm... Well then... Understandable that we were cutting it close but the service was ridiculous. Few tables on the patio and a few inside. Not busy by any means. However. The beer was delicious. Asked for a HOPPY ipa and was not disappointed (not sure what it was). After the long wait and no brunch settled up for the beer and headed to Cabo. Sad I really want to like this. Maybe down the road."}
{"text":"At a glance, this looks like just another bar where you might expect to find some greasy pub food. I stopped in because my roommate recommended the place, and I sure as hell don't regret it. Lee, the bartender, is clearly a fan of the food and gave me his first and second choices for each category when I asked for a recommendation. I took my cues from him and had possibly the best pulled pork I have ever tasted (along with some great mac n cheese). Lee also kept my water glass full, which is no small feat. All in all, I was very impressed and I will be back."}
{"text":"Great food and music. Best buffalo chicken sandwich I've had in forever! Get the Mac n cheese, no seriously you should get it. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. If it were closer I would go once a week. My favorites are the chili cheese fries and the Mac and cheese, they've always been perfect!"}
{"text":"Went here after the Parquet Courts show. Jacks Mac and cheese is awesome. Prices for everything seemed perfectly reasonable and both hot dogs and burger were tasty. The band  even came in after the show to eat, very cool. Most of them are vegetarian, so they must have been happy with the veg options since they stayed and ate. Went back another day and had the Philly. Also good. Nice dive bar option in Noda that never seems over-crowded."}
{"text":"Hard to find good live music in Charlotte but this place is built for it.  In the winter they have an amazing outdoor heater system so it's like you are outdoors.  They have good specials and embodies the NODA atmosphere."}
{"text":"Get the mac and cheese. I do not see how anyone could not like coming to this place. It is amazing. Prob the best food you will find after 2 am when the bars close. Very chill and very good. That's really all you need."}
{"text":"I had one of the best burgers I have ever had in my life,  the Blue Bayou!  Great food,  great service,  and good beer selection"}
{"text":"$1 beers! Love to dollarbate whenever I can.  Had the Stugots sandwich and it is delicious.  Basicly it's a cheese steak sandwich with peperoni instead of green peppers... yup, delicious."}
{"text":"Ate here 2 different times now. I'd give this restaurant a higher rating if they'd iron out a few details. A big one for me is that they serve instant sweet tea, not brewed. Huge difference in flavor guys!! I love me a good glass of sweet tea with my meal. Also, when asked for my biscuit to eat my gravy with, it was literally hard as stone. No kidding. I showed it to the waitress, and she did bring out 2 fresh ones. But, it was a joke at our table. Food was ok... Potatoes/home fries needed more seasoning. Bottom line, I'll be back. But, not for a while to see if they got real tea to serve to their customers."}
{"text":"We're out of towners in for a late bite. Food was delicious and the bar was as expected. I definitely recommend the Widowmaker (seriously yum) and the black and blue mac n cheese might almost be TOO blue. definitely for a Blu cheese lover. Staff was prompt and friendly!"}
{"text":"Fun place with good food and beer! Burgers, sandwiches ,hot dogs, cheese steaks, etc. Must try the mac n cheese! They have a few different styles so don't pass that up! Friendly employees and quick service."}
{"text":"I would eat here every day if I could. The only thing they are missing is a macaroni and cheese sampler so I can have them all in one sitting. Absolutely amazing food, great staff, and if you have a choice, always, always, always try some mac and cheese."}
{"text":"The food was really good and fresh.  We had the hot garlic wings and the Hawaiian wings.  The hot garlic ones were great but the Hawaiian wings were just ok, they could have used some more seasoning.  The waffle fries we're also great, they stayed crispy the entire time until we got to our destination.  Even after being closed up they were not soggy."}
{"text":"New favorite pub in Noda! $1 Lionhead cans...2 for $5 top-your-own hotdogs....friendly bartender. I like it...I like it a lot!"}
{"text":"They have tasty burgers and tenders. We went last night, and they had a great high gravity beer on special for $3. Can't beat that!

I had the patty melt which was very flavorful, if a bit greasy, on Texas toast. It was served with a side of waffle fries. The fries have recently started some type of seasoning, which I can't place. It's neither good nor bad, it just is. 

The chicken tenders are always a great choice. They have a light breading, and there are a variety of sauces. We tried leg jumper based in the reviews of other helpers. It was a spicy mango habanero. When it was too spicy, we asked for honey mustard. That was an additional 50 cents on the bill for a second sauce. Lame. 

The patio is nice, and I recommend sitting out there."}
{"text":"Came here one Saturday for lunch because the place we were trying to go had a long wait and we were too hungry to wait. 
We sat down right away and ordered right away. The first waitress was really nice but another waiter was in training and he took our order. 
I ordered two hot dogs with a side of fries and my husband ordered a widow maker philly with a side of mac and cheese. 

The food took over 30 minutes to come out. Im not sure if they were having an off day but 30 min for a hot dog and cheese steak is pretty ridiculous. All the tables around us looked pretty pissed waiting for their food. 
The food itself tasted like food from a carnival. soggy bun with store bought sausage. My husbands sandwich was served with the fries I had ordered with my hot dogs and his mac and cheese never came out. The fries were sooo crispy it tasted like potato chips. Overall, very bad experience. Will not be coming back."}
{"text":"We went in today for a bite w/ our child, since we saw another family there.  Let me say that we loved the atmosphere for adults...for drinks.  It took well OVER 30 minutes to make 2 hot dogs and fries (which were burnt) w/gravy and cheese. Oh, and the my coke was practically flat.  Good luck to them but if your going to do food, they really need to step it up a few notches."}
{"text":"For only being to 3 bars and 1 brewery in NODA, I'm probably not qualified to critique but I really liked this place.  Love the dive-y but not scary atmosphere.  Exposed brick walls and all types of art hanging around. I didn't eat but did get a look at the SOS and I'm definitely interested. Nice area out back for us smokers, (boo hiss) but also great for dogs. Plus they have a giant heat lamp that hangs from above, so warm that I felt a little like a french fry but hey, better than the alternative.  Tip: that cool art is also for sale and not too bad. I bought the giant dog art right off the wall!"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here today, and as always the food is excellent. My only complaint is management. The manager was talking extremely rude to her staff in front of my husband and me. The issue that I had was she was visibly disrespecting her staff for clearing tables and bathroom checks continuously; however, she stayed seated at a table texting on her personal cell phone while calling out orders. It even got to the point the cook brought her a bowl of food out., as he was waiting on her hand and foot. You could tell her staff was visibly upset by the way she was treating them, but didn't have the voice to be able to speak. As a customer,  I can use this platform and hopefully the owner/upper management  of Jack Beagles can get to the bottom of this serous management issue."}
{"text":"Walking past JackBeagles, I never suspected it to be so great!  The signage is minimal and doesn't do this place justice, but I can't reduce my rating because of a lack of signage!  

Went there with a group of 6, and had a great time.  The lighting is good, the exposed brick is perfect, beer selection is unique, refreshing, and affordable, and the menu is interesting.  NoDa lacks great food, until now."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I'd love it even more if it was in Plaza Midwood, but what can ya do!  

Their fries are this insane potato chip-had-sex-with-a-french-fry concoction and they are AMAAAAAAAAAAZING.  they apparently bake them & then fry them.   I have yet to have anything on the menu that I haven't liked & the same has gone for everyone i've taken there.  they've all raved about the food & one friend after finishing off her burger & fries ordered a 2nd basket of fries she thought they were so good!

they have a killer beer selection, which rotates near constantly (so their beer menu is never up to date, my only gripe) but who cares when on a tuesday you can get a Big Boss Big Operator for half price??

I really need to check this place out for breakfast though, it sounds yummy & cheap."}
{"text":"I haven't had a whole lot of the food here. The drink specials are usually great, but the food is lacking when it comes to meat-free options. I have had the build your own fries which is a nice treat after practice now and again. A few weeks ago I finally got to go for brunch. The prices were on par with typical breakfast places like Ihop. I had the tradition breakfast of eggs and hash browns hold the bacon. I asked for toast but they brought me biscuits so I tried them and wasn't impressed in the least. They were very heavy and dense. They didn't have the flaky texture I was looking for. The biggest plus here is a great beer selection and a cool patio."}
{"text":"Order from here every now and again and today I found a wrapper clearly cooked into the sandwich meat."}
{"text":"Everything you'd ever want in a dive bar. Not to mention killer breakfast on the weekend.  The same place you might stumble in at 2am on a Saturday,  packed to the brim, is quaint and charming enough to take your mom for a nice lunch. Great service,  nice beer selection,  excellent burgers,  and famous Mac n cheese. Yes, please!"}
{"text":"Great drinks, and food! Actual bbq style hot dogs!!! Love outdoor grill dogs!!! Good music and outdoor are was a nice vibe as well!"}
{"text":"10 stars.  The best food in Charlotte.  Every one of their macs is mind blowing.  Fire grilled burgers.  Nice music scene.  Love jack beagless!!"}
{"text":"I was introduced to Jack beagles a while ago from a co-worker of mine. He raved about the wings and the mac and cheese and I have to admit he was correct although I have fell in love with the cheese steaks, usually the Widowmaker but more recently the Stugots. Words cannot describe how delicious this sandwich is. Bread is nice and soft and the pepperoni gives it a different flavor. Would definitely recommend. The atmosphere in Jack beagles is pretty cool and laid-back. We like to head out back to the patio and listen to live music. I knew they were dog friendly but for some reason I never paid attention to it. If I had to have a complaint about anything it would be how employees come and pet dogs and then they are around food. Now I didn't see my server do this but I did see several employees pet the dogs there on the patio and then go serve food. Now I know that pets are like some people's children but I would prefer if the person that is handling my food not just get licked by a dog. Other than that I love Jack beagles and will continue to frequent this establishment. I'll just make sure I keep a hawk eye on my server."}
{"text":"Mac n cheese.... Yummmm! You get 5 selections to choose from. A must try!"}
{"text":"We went around 5 on a Friday, and had no trouble finding inside seating. The back patio was filling up and preparing for live music. 
Our waiter gave us some good suggestions for beer. We started with wings and added waffle fries for $1. The wings were ok, sauce was great but wings were plain. Just warm chicken and skin with sauce on bottom of plate- next time I would ask that they be grilled, fried or charred. This is why I gave 4 stars instead of 5.

But we did not go there for chicken wings we went for burgers! We were not disappointed. I had the classic with American cheese, Little mayo, lettuce , onion and tomato on a great roll. My son ordered the bleu cheese burger which was covered with yummy toppings and perfectly cooked. I cannot say enough about how good though rolls are, like a kaiser roll but not as doughy.
Great beer, great service, great burgers and fun venue."}
{"text":"Great service and tasty bar food!  Wings were wonderfully cooked and had great flavor.  The Jack Mac (macaroni and cheese) was a great twist on a classic.  Loved the slight spice and fresh garlic.  The classic philly and cheese was awesome.  The bread was spot on and the steak had so much flavor (get the wiz).  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Can't get over the Mac N Cheese they have. They literally have any Mac N cheese combo you could think of. Just had the mexi-mac. F*#K !!!!  Also, the boneless barbosa wings, my lord!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get a bite -  the philly cheese steak rocks, pork belly tacos and of course the Mac and cheese options.  Laid back bar type atmosphere w live music on most evenings.  They have a large patio to take advantage of sunny days.

I just had my first breakfast here on a Sunday which starts at 9.  Super super good w lots of options.

Always top notch service."}
{"text":"Giving 4 stars even though the food sucks because it's an awesome place to hang out especially when there's live music out back (shout out to Falcon Heart- best cover band EVER)- go to drink and have a good time, just don't eat the food."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat for a good price. Wednesday is half off wings and they are delicious! Try the barbalo sauce if you can't choose between buffalo and BBQ like me. The appetizer chicken tenders are juicy and the breeding is very tasty! Plus they come with French fries. You can't beat that. 

The best thing on the menu is the Mac n cheese. You can't go wrong with any of them. I have noticed if you go during non rush hours (probably before 5pm) it's super cheesy. But honestly any time is good and they make it to order so you know you aren't getting 1-2hr old pre-made Mac n cheese. You might be thinking a bowl won't fill you up, but trust me. It will!! 

They have pretty good beer specials and prices. The bar staff has always been good and most people at the bar are friendly. 

Around 5 or 6pm they dim the light and the music gets a little louder so if you are looking for a more quiet environment come a little earlier. It's a good bet that they will have live music on the stage in the back and every time I've been there or walked by it been great! Good place, fun times. If your in Noda and need a place to eat for on the cheap stop here. Or if you have a craving for Mac n cheese don't even consider anywhere else!!"}
{"text":"Best drunk food ever.  The boneless wings are amazing, burgers and Mac and cheese!.  Good music, the best place in noda to get some late night eats."}
{"text":"Went tonight on the recommendation of other Yelp users, hoping for the best.  There was a table available with no wait, and the service was superb.  Food was outstanding!  Had the Blue Bayou burger, the pulled pork sandwich, and sides of mac and cheese and chili.  EVERYTHING was terrific.  Extremely fast service, great prices, and overall a wonderful surprise.  Had no idea this place was even there, and the other reviewers who mentioned the lack of signage weren't exaggerating.... There is no sign in the front other than a small white board inside the front window with a handwritten \"Jack Beagles\" and the daily special written on it.  Am almost glad it's hard to spot -- Would hate to have to wait for such great food and service if word really got out!  Fabulous!  (We actually recommended the place to a couple that were debating whether or not to go in after they found out about the wait at the place a couple of doors down...... Hope they liked it as much as we did!)  Will definitely go back.  The wings looked really, really good!"}
{"text":"Oooooooh Beagles, how do I love thee, but the last 2 nights in a row you hustled me on my tab.

I really hope this rant doesn't affect my future service at this place, even with the bad rating I will return and hopefully update this with a higher rating in the future.  I can't not come here, its probably the best place in NoDa for a reasonably priced food and beer.  That patio will be rockin in the spring.

I'll tell the 2 stories though.

The first night I ordered a ripper, awesome dog for the money.  I got the special tropical version with mango.  Soooo tasty and I'm not a hotdog lover.  It says on the menu $2.99, $1 more for a jumbo.  I would assume that that means it would come to 3.99, but it rings up 4.50.  I asked my waitress about this and she said nobody had ever complained before.  I told her that it didn't really matter that nobody had noticed the overcharge I wasn't going to pay it.  She said she couldn't do anything about and got the manager.  He was seemed friendly at first but then actually had the nerve to tell me \"its only .50\", I agreed with him.  Yes, its only .50, but it took some bickering back and forth before I could it taken off.  If the customer catches you overcharging, don't argue with me about it.  Ironically, I was hilariously talking NASCAR with the owner at the table next to us but I don't think he noticed what was going on.  I still tipped the waitress $5 on this small tab, just to let her know it was the principle of the matter, not me being a cheap ass.

But, I still love this place, so I came back the next night.  It seemed like the perfect segway between the Triple C elite event and the absolutely amazing Emancipator show at the neighborhood theater.  Plus, they had hop slam and 1/2 priced wings, or at least advertised half priced wings.  I ordered 12 wings, the menu says they are $9.99 and the specials board said half priced wings, so that comes to $6.50 right?  No, half of $10 is $5, easy math I thought.  When I asked about it, I was told that the half priced deal is only on the 6 wings and I didn't order 12 wings, I ordered to orders of 6.  I thought that 6 wings were only $6, not $6.50 as well, but maybe I was mistaken.  This time I didn't make quite as big of a deal about it as it was still a good deal.  But then, as we started to leave my friend noticed her purse had been sitting in a pool of water that they neglected to clean up.  Her key FOB for her car was ruined and all of here business cards were as well.  Not completely their fault as the customer who did it should have fessed up, but PLEASE get your $@!^ together people.

Moral of the story is, this place is awesome and the prices are fair, but please just let me know if you are going to charge me more than what the menu states, maybe if I was drunk I wouldn't notice, but that practice just ain't right."}
{"text":"Fun bar, great bar food.

If you're drinking in NoDa, you need to go here.

Get something fried, go out back and listen to a mediocre live band, and drink excessively."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!  The place is cute and Alyssa was great and very attentive.  I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"This place didn't stand out. It wasn't bad either though. I rolled in here needing some food late after a concert. It took a lengthy amount of time to be taken care of. Aside from sitting down and waiting for nearly 15 minutes for the waiter to acknowledge us her service was ok. They were missing the most famous local craft brew which was disappointing. The food was average pub food. I wouldn't go in here expecting wow but it should meet most standards."}
{"text":"Loved the dumpster fries! We also had double mimosas and burgers. Was a great early lunch. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place last night. There was a fantastic blues band playing with ample outdoor seating. The bar staff was friendly and the drinks were affordable, what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"In reply to the owner, on my previous review:
I think you misunderstood me a bit. I was asked to stand outside and finish my hot dog, and then I could come in. I was not asked to leave for being intoxicated. When I came in, as I was told I would be allowed to, he asked for ID which I provided. I then made a joke, and was pushed out the door despite the fact that I was not resisting or denying leaving whatsoever. He just said \"Then you can get out again\" and pushed me. \"Escorting\" and pushing are two wildly different actions. I don't think that's fair or professional. After the owner of another business who witnessed the whole thing reasoned with him, he then told me I could come inside. If I'd been in the wrong, I don't think this would have been his ultimate decision."}
{"text":"We've been to JackBeagles 3 times so far. The bartenders are always friendly, the food is delicious (the pimento Mac and cheese is out of this world kinda good)! They have a nice inside with tables and bar seating, and seating outside that is covered. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here on a whim one day and I never looked back. 
Apparently, it was brand new the first time I went which explained why I wasn't sure how I ended up in this place or why I had never heard of it. It began as any awesome place should. Small menu on a piece of paper, drink specials on the board, fun wait/bar staff and a casual, artsy atmosphere. First impression was that it is s.m.a.l.l. I wondered how we would fit a large group in here on a Friday night while we're bar hopping, but do not fear. We've done it successfully many times since then. After gathering my visual impressions, I ordered a beer the waitress suggested and some food and all I can say is HOLY. The beer was a cider-type something or another and it was sweet, light and delicious. The food was a California Philly. I didn't think I'd like the food but I gave it a shot and I am SO GLAD. The fries are more like thin potato wedges with spices and they're fantastic. I love a bar with unique fries - makes a lasting impression. I've since tried almost all of the menu items (which they continue adding to) and I love it all from appetizers to entrees to the new breakfast menu to the excellent beer selection. Double date night coming up? Hungry after bar hopping? Not sure what to get for dinner on random Tuesday night? Jack Beagles has NEVER let me down."}
{"text":"Stopped by because I heard they have good cheesesteaks. When we arrived, no one greeted us so we kind of just stood there. We actually walked out to go somewhere else but went back bc I thought, well I'm here let me just stay and try the food. The second time we came in, we stood there again but someone eventually greeted us. Our waiter was pleasant but the whole time I kept thinking about how rude it was that we were ignored and not greeted or told we could seat ourselves. I ordered the cheesesteak, hotdog, and macaroni. The cheesesteak was ok. Not the best. The hot dog was pretty good. The mac and cheese was very good. Overall the experience wasn't the best and the food was decent. I would go back for the Mac and cheese if I happen to be in the area."}
{"text":"A great bar in NoDa, there weekend breakfast is very good. Ask for the S@$&? On a Plate."}
{"text":"Holy crap!  We've eaten burgers all over the country.  I've never had one as good as this.  I got the one with pepper jack cheese and jalapeños (can't remember name) and it was juicy, extremely tasty, and irresistible. The female in our picture got the blue cheese burger and, believe it or not, it was better than mine.  We also got some blue cheese and bacon mac and cheese that was very, very good.  When I get a hamburger craving, I'm coming here.

There was a mix of people... bikers, college kids, old people, and good-looking ones like us."}
{"text":"In the last year, my fiance' and I have had the chance to try a lot of different restaurants in Charlotte.  

For a comfortable, low key, well priced meal, I can't go wrong here. It's a fun spot in NoDa with a little stage for live music.  I simply adore the food here. From their burgers and cheese-steak sandwiches to their specialty mac n cheese it's all a win. 
And they have daily food and drink specials.

The only thing I'd change is I'd prefer my Guinness on tap than the bottles."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here almost every Thursday night for beer and hot dogs - which are delicious and cheap! You can get a hot dog, with variety of toppings (I usually get mine grilled with sauerkraut and spicy mustard), for just $2.50, add a side, like fries or coleslaw, for $1. Best deal EVER! Beers on tap are local and are changed frequently. Addition: The macaroni and cheese is to die for.

The music is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get. I've heard Prince, Smashing Pumpkins, TLC, it's all over, but usually themed for the night, i.e. the night I heard TLC was mid-late 90s hits. Sometimes it's 70s funk, or 80s rock.... Aaaand it's awesome. You get the picture. 

Our favorite bartender is Kristin or \"Bunny.\" She's attentive, efficient, and super sweet and pleasant. 

There isn't much seating, so if you're a group of 5 or more, good luck with grabbing a table inside. I think they have live music out back and more seating, but smoking's  allowed (it's outdoors).

To sum it up: Jack Beagle's is a hipster dive bar, with good music, decent beer selection, and low prices. It's completely unpretentious and is, what I think, the jewel of NoDa."}
{"text":"We started our evening out with some friends at Jack Beagles to get some food before our eventual pub crawl through NoDa.  This was my first time here, but the burgers were recommended by our friends and I ordered the classic cheeseburger, while the wife had the vegetable pita wrap. I also ordered a Hopulent IPA, which they had on draft, among the 8 or so draft beers that they had to offer.  Burger meat was cooked medium since the waitress asked about my preference and my burger was juicy, but not really greasy.  The standard toppings included lettuce, tomato and onions.  I did not get a side, since we were just getting a snack and I was not too hungry, but I guess those are extra.  I really enjoyed their basic burger and would certainly try another one of their signature burgers next time.
The wife enjoyed her vegetable wrap, but found it a bit greasy due to the amount of cheese on the inside.  She actually removed a good bit of the cheese, and would probably try something else in the future or maybe holding the cheese on the veggie wrap.

The atmosphere was cool inside, as it was an old brick building that was a manufacturing plant in the past before it was converted to a restaurant/bar.  It was a little hot inside the place, probably due to the central open kitchen and the fact that it was 100 degrees that day.

I would return on a cooler day with no hesitation."}
{"text":"$3.50 Bloody Marys on Sunday, a Mac & Cheese section on the menu, bleu & bacon, jalapenos, chili, sweet jesus, bring them all.  Those wonderful little moon bites, freshly cut french fries.  Super nice staff.  Inexpensive booze prices anyway. I can't believe I don't live there.  Total boner for Jack Beagles.  They have recently added a great patio out back!"}
{"text":"Jack Beagles is a nice, cozy bar (right, Brittany!) in NoDa & it's my go to spot for yummy cheesesteaks! Do yourself a favor & get one of these. So yummy!

Sundays are fun too, as they play sporting events & there are lots of people to see & talk to.

They do have specials, which they normally have posted on the chalkboard sign outside."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Jack Beagles! I go there a few times a week for dinner and drinks and it has never disappointed! The food is amazing. The wings, the burgers, the mac and cheese, the breakfast, and especially the Boss Man hotdog. The staff is always so friendly and welcoming. Amazing food and service. Half the time I sit at the bar and have a beer while I wait on my takeout food and it has become my favorite spot."}
{"text":"I heart you beagles your staff is always so friendly, your food never disappoints me, breakfast, lunch or dinner you make me happy.
They have a great beer selection and I heard a rumor that they are going to be introducing a full menu soon.  By far one of my favorite places to grab a drink in Charlotte.  Eat a burger one of the best I've had in town."}
{"text":"JackBeagles does quite a few things right. Easy watering hole for the NoDa walker in us all, and plenty of bar food to fill the bellies of those pounding copious amounts of brewskies or other unmentionable swill. 

Gotta say I love the Rippers. I'm a fan of a hot dog just about any day of the week and JB's was right on the money. I like a little bit of char on my dog, a little white onion, relish and yellow mustard. However, \"ripped,\" means split and deep fried. What the eff?! Who knew hotdogs could be more awesome. 

Plenty of beer to choose from here. Love that they have a good variety of bottles, too. 

Where I can't say this is my go-to spot for dinner or food in general when in NoDa, I really want to check out the brunch. With \"Shit on a Shingle,\" which I haven't had in years, these guys have piqued my interest for a future Sunday brunch spot."}
{"text":"Alyssa was terrible.  I am rating the restaurant a 5 purely because of the bartenders and the great food but she was awful. I heard her talking crap about the staff members and she was super slow. So unprofessional. I will be back purely because Adam and Stephanie were such great bartenders."}
{"text":"The breakfast here is real.  

I have been to JackBeagles twice, both for breakfast on Saturday mornings.  I love that you can get right in this place, no wait, no fuss.  

I run the breakfast burrito, which is always made fresh to order, filled with soft, scrambled eggs, cheese, bacon and green peppers.  It's is very big and very filling (that's what she said, haha).  I have a buddy that always orders the eggs benedict, which he swears bye.  

The service is superb, especially at the bar where I always sit.

JackBeagles becomes a much more appealing option when you consider how packed places like Zada Jane's gets on Saturday and Sunday mornings.  The early morning simplicity is what draws me to Jack Bs for breakfast and is why I will definitely be back one morning soon."}
{"text":"Best mac n cheese in town! Great beer selection! Love the outdoor area in the back (that is dog friendly) with live music on certain nights!"}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in Noda and Charlotte. If you happen to wander in, ask for David. Top notch service from him everytime. Also, the buried treasure fries are dope."}
{"text":"I went here on the advice of Yelpers and was a bit disappointed. We arrived around 2 pm on a Saturday to the Queen City.

The prices are definitely on point. I ordered a classic burger with a side of mac and cheese. My boyfriend ordered the pulled pork salad. The burger was pretty good, but I was expecting to be REALLY blown away based on these reviews. As for the mac and cheese... eh. I like mine to be creamy and unbaked. I was hoping for more with that whole little menu of mac and cheeses and was very underwhelmed. (My boyfriend did like his salad.)

The service was not great. We waited over half an hour for a burger and a salad in a mostly empty restaurant. I didn't feel like the service was particularly professional. I don't mind a little wait, but this didn't seem proportional to what we ordered.

I really wanted to like it here, but based on my experience, I will not be back next time I'm around Charlotte."}
{"text":"My favorite bar in NoDa.  Good breakfast (and food in general but I pretty much only eat there for breakfast on the weekend), good beers, good music, and the bartenders are just snooty enough to keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Pretty good but not the best Philly cheesesteak I have ever had. Then again I am from up north so I have kind of high standards. All things told this place seems like a cool place to come and get a beer and chill out for the night."}
{"text":"Great dive bar.  Good prices and good variety of beer.  Laid back, NoDa attitude.  Good enough brunch. I have many good memories here."}
{"text":"Jack Beagles serves a great brunch and a mean Bloody Mary. My running group eats there every Saturday; they accommodate a bunch of sweaty, thirsty runners with no complaints. The only downside is that service can be a bit slow. I love their skinny puppy omelette and their breakfast taters are out of this world!"}
{"text":"Mmmm. great food, cheap alcohol and a nice backyard/patio.  what else could you want.

tried the cheesesteak, french fries, and the pulled pork . all really delicious."}
{"text":"I was with a group of friends that wanted to get a bite to eat in NoDa, with a few requirements.  1) No bar food 2) No Revolution (they just ate there the night before) 3) No crazy wait.  Because this was a sunny, warm, winter day in NoDa, there were some crazy waits at Cabo.  

I had been to Jack Beagles once before for a quick bite and thought it'd be the perfect place.  We had a bit of a wait because all eight of the tables were taken and the patio wasn't quite open.  It was odd hanging out by the door waiting for a table with no recognition from the staff.

We finally got a table and were greeted by our waitress.  I ordered mac & cheese - the one with the pepper jack cheese.  A friend of mine, who loves everything super hot, ordered the hottest wings that they have.  The food didn't all come out at the same time, which was a bit weird, but it was all super good. 

I need to go back and try other mac & cheeses.  I love that a bowl is filling, but also easy on the wallet."}
{"text":"Pretty eclectic menu and good beer selection, though not many on draft.  Killer burgers and dogs don't come here if you are counting calories.  

Patio - Yes out back
Happy Hour - Yes"}
{"text":"Amazingly rude bartenders. 

My co-workers and I, who all work in the service industry, went to Jack Beagles last night (2/25) after our shift. The bartenders at the outdoor bar called \"last call\" 5 minutes after we had already been standing in line. It took him 10 min to get to us, only to tell us he couldn't get us a final drink because it was too late. He showed me on his own phone that it was 1:58 am. 

Thank you for making us wait in line for 10 minutes to rudely not serve us, just because you were ready to leave. If you don't want to work late on the weekends, find a different job to be less than satisfactory at."}
{"text":"Was in the mood to try their SOS.  It's basically a southern version of a classic served on Texas toast and topped with sausage gravy,  plus they substitute the original chipped beef for chopped meat and onions.   Think of it as a Philly grinder smothered with sausage gravy.   For an extra $3 they'll put a couple fried eggs on it,  too.  Overall,  the meal was tasty and filling;  however, not really a monster do-over.   This sandwich wasn't unique enough for me to return to a bar that's just waking up and decided to cook breakfast."}
{"text":"Fun live music and really delicious food as well. Friendly staff. You can tell the staff cares about their work and the success of their operations. I enjoy getting drinks here at night and a quick bite during lunch hours."}
{"text":"I feel like my review for this place is unfair because i had to leave before being able to give it a really good try but the mimosas are good and I can't wait to come back and try the adult themed mac and cheeses."}
{"text":"Went for lunch, at about 12:30 on Saturday with the wife, so I thought. 

We were handed breakfast menus. Breakfast? At 1230? Yup! Asked for lunch menu. Was told can't get lunch til 1:30. That was weird. 

Had \"breakfast\". Wife had omelette with taters and I had SOS w/ taters. Food was okay. Wouldn't go back for breakfast. Probably won't go back for lunch due to the inconvenience. 

Really need to make lunch earlier."}
{"text":"I have to say that my pulled pork omelet was the best pulled pork omelet I have ever had - oh, by the way, it was the ONLY one I have ever had. 

Sometimes, you just need a quick, simple meal, and this was it for our last breakfast in Charlotte. The pulled pork was good enough, and the omelet well-put together, fused together with delicious cheese. I want to to say the biscuits weren't made in house, and the home fries were DEFINITELY from a bag, but frankly I didn't expect much more. 

This would probably warrant 3.5 stars, but I decided to round up since everyone was nice at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Really liked this spot.  Good food served up pretty quick, and a great price.  We had the hot garlic parm wings to start, very tasty.  As others have stated the fries were really good.  Chili was good too, I think I'll have it on a hot dog next time.  I enjoyed the cheesesteak but my wife wasn't a huge fan of it.  I liked that the steak was tender but she found it a little bland.  Regardless she is just as ready as I am to go back.  The music was an interesting mix but memorable...heard some throw back boy bands and Brittany Spears, and some Blind Melon I think."}
{"text":"Delicious, inexpensive, friendly staff and patrons.  New favorite laid back spot"}
{"text":"Nicely crowded early evening dinner/bar scene. The dinner salad with chicken was large and delicious.  The kitchen here is always spot on. Nice selection of draft and bottled beer. Attentive and friendly staff. Great spot in NoDa."}
{"text":"Beagles might be one of my favorite watering holes.. EVER! As a local NoDa resident, I love how laid back and fun this bar is. No matter if you show up for Trivia on Tuesdays, to watch the game on Sunday or to just relax after a bike ride, Beagles is sure to make you happy.  Oh and their \"Jack Mac\" mac & cheese.. stupid good.

And you've gotta love a bar that has no sign out front :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a French toast. Not only was it undercooked but it tasted mediocre. I could taste the runny eggs in the French toast. It was disgusting. I even told the waiter it was undercooked and he did nothing about it. No discount, nothing.

It was also served with packets of pancake syrup, which is not impressive. I am very disappointed and I will never come back here. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"Mac and Cheese is to die for! They serve food till 2am! They have a front (indoor) bar and back (outdoor) bar! Outside they have a huge stage that try book live music for!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and excellent food. So much bang for your buck! 

Drinks are strong, fast and cold!

Music venue leaves little to be desired. Get some bands in there! (Modern music)"}
{"text":"Mighty mighty yummy bar food. Love the outdoor area- plenty of space to spread out and listen but not have to yell over the live music. I'm a fan of the build your own mac and cheese. Love that that their burgers are hormone free and all-natural. I enjoyed the sloppy joe and have magical things about the hot dogs here. Great bloody marys if you are in to that kind of thing. Combine my two favs the chili and the mac and cheese into some epic chili mac. Not much parking so best to bike or park on a side street. And best price- things are priced very fairly for the food quality."}
{"text":"They have a great patio!! Weekend brunch is super affordable, too. $ 'mosas and $4.99 b banana pancakes!"}
{"text":"Very poor service. We were seated at 1:15pm and received drinks and our order was taken in a timely manner; however, the food never came. Our server never returned. We had to call her over in order to inquire about our food. At 2:30 she told us there were still 2 tables in front of us. We left. She was nice enough but had no knowledge regarding the menu or what the word \"substitute\" meant. With the new train line running from University to Uptown one would think the pubs would be working overtime trying to pull in new customers. Jackbeagle needs to make some serious changes if they want to compete. We ran into 4 parties at another restaurant who left Jackbeagles today because of poor service."}
{"text":"8 bucks a can for that stuff brewed down the street.  I just don't get it. Even the waitress was like yeah I know that shits too expensive. The band was playing Neil diamond covers and making me feel like a loser. They kept making eye contact and doing that blowjob motion. I felt violated. They played an incubus cover that made me reconsider being such a huge incubus fann. Emailed their publicist so they know what fuck shit goes on at JackBeagles. 

Skip."}
{"text":"I love JackBeagles. We come here for breakfast every couple of weeks or so. We love the outdoor seating area and they are very dog friendly so we always bring our two dogs with us. The staff here is amazing and the food is delicious. Very generous portions and they serve Pure Intentions coffee, which is amazingly yummy and made locally. Make sure you bring your appetite. The portions are huge. The pancakes, French toast and skinny puppy are our favorites and the biscuits are great too. But everything here is yummy. I've been here for drinks and bar food as well and it's always been a great time. Love supporting local and walking here with the dogs. They have our continued business."}
{"text":"Mike was handing out breakfast only Beagle Bucks Friday night when I stopped in for a beer.  So this morning, I took advantage of their opening at 7am on Saturdays and Sundays for breakfast and enjoyed a nice hearty meal.
I had the Basic Beagle Breakfast.  Two eggs any style (scrambled), bacon or sausage (3 strips of tasty perfectly cooked bacon), breakfast potatoes or grits (potatoes since i am still unwilling to let go of my Yankee-ness to eat grits), and biscuits or toast (two great biscuits), all with a little fruit cup.
They have breakfast wraps and tweaks to your standard breakfast fare.  Next time, I will venture for the Shit on a Shingle.  Up north, that is creamed chipped beef on toast.  There, it is more like your sausage biscuits and gravy only on texas toast.
All of it is reasonably priced and a great breakfast option in the hood that is open early.  Just sucks waiting until noon to wash it down with a mimosa or bloody mary..."}
{"text":"Looking for a bar with good food, good drinks, a friendly staff, and nice people? Well normally I would tell you to keep dreaming because no bar has all of things at once right? That's what I used to say before I went to JackBeagles!

I first discovered this place a couple of years ago while hanging out in NoDa shortly after moving to Charlotte.  Since then I've been back several times.  

The staff is always friendly, it's like they actually enjoy their jobs and want to be there.  I can't say that I've ever had a bad experience here with any of them over the years.  I was pleasantly surprised by how friendly the other patrons are and how inviting the atmosphere is at a whole.  One of the  few bars I've come to where you can really just sit down and feel free talk to anyone. Just about everyone seems to be having a good time enjoying their food/drinks and very social.  I've met all kinds of people here.  If you come during evening hours they usually have some good music playing in the background as well.

But enough about the people, let's talk about the food.  First I have to get into the Mac n Cheese because this is the dish that's going to keep most coming back.  JackBeagles has hands down some of the best Mac n Cheese I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot of mac n cheese).  They have several different styles but if it's your first time then I recommend starting with the signature Jack's Mac.  Prepare to be blown away.  On your subsequent visits (because you'll probably come back), feel free to try the other flavors as they're all amazing.  My other favorite is the Mexi-Mac.

If you need something more then you have to try one of their hot dogs.  Trust me all you need is 1.  These things pack a delicious wallop.  For the bravest souls I have to suggest the Buried Treasure Fries.  These aren't your traditional cheese fries.  Once you order them and see all the things topped onto them, you'll realize why they're called \"buried treasure\" fries.   You might want to share these with your date as it's quite a bit for one person to handle.

I can't recommend this place enough.  If you're only in Charlotte for a short amount of time and want to experience a good bar atmosphere and at the same time grab a delicious meal, head to JackBeagles.  Good thing I don't live in this part of town or else they'd have all my money haha."}
{"text":"Super fun place to go on a Friday night! They had a live band playing with a decent size dance floor. Drinks were decent. We ordered the fries smothered in chili, cheese, and pork and they were pretty amazing!"}
{"text":"Had the Carne Asada Tacos and a cup of the Mac n Cheese and both were awesome. Lots of flavor and highly recommended! Perfect for a quick lunch. Clean and nice atmosphere. Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I mean shut the front door!  No really, get out of your house, shut the door and drive straight to JackBeagles.  This place is out of this world good.  Good beers on draft, friendly servers, awesome food, and great prices. The burgers and hot dogs are amazing.  I tried the Blue Bayou...I don't even like blue cheese, and I was scraping the crumbs off and smashing the homecut fries into the stuff.  Can't wait to go back and try one of everything on the menu!!"}
{"text":"Good cocktails, and pub food for is perfect for when you're feeling like indulging.  I've had the Buffalo sammich, boneless wings,  and Philly cheese steak.  Was not disappointed at all, and everything is affordable."}
{"text":"When you walk in to JackBeagles, just keep walking until you go out the back door and find the back patio - this is why I keep coming back here.  The back patio has a large number of tables, a bar and a sometimes stage with live music.  

It's a bit divey and more than casual - making it the perfect place to grab a burger or wings and a beer with absolutely zero pretense.  

We like to go on Sundays to watch the Panthers and enjoy $6.50 double bloody marys and $5 large mimosas."}
{"text":"Jack Beagle's reminds me of something like Cheers. It's a local spot where everyone knows your name.  It's located in one of the artistic side of town of NODA. Which is filled with many eclectic and fun bars. The abeyance is real cool and laid back. Tables are comfortable and clean. I went for a late lunch on a Monday and was seated as soon as we walked in. The waiter came with water in hand and was ready for our drink orders.( That was great). We came in after viewing the menu on yelp. So we were ready to order.  I got the treasure fries with chili W beans ( don't be like me and let your eyes be bigger then your belly.) i also ordered 12 hot wings 1/2 hot and the other 1/2 hot garlic parm.  The food came out hot and was very good. The fries could have used a lil salt but hey they were still good. The service was great and it's good bar food.  Think I'll try their signature Mac. Don't look at me crazy because I heard it was amazing. Go try it for yourself and let me know what you think!"}
{"text":"Good local spot in NoDa. Simple bar and dining section. Patio outback. Good mac n cheese and \"ripped\" hotdogs. (Deep fried until they rip open)"}
{"text":"In the past I ate here ever firday with friends for months. However our schedule didn't work anymore so I decided to go back on a Thursday afternoon with new friends. Thought they would love it like I do. Needless to stay they complained about every thing!. Dog this Dog that..  so if you don't like dogs around your Are while u eat. This is not the place for you.
I will continue to come here for great drink specials and great food. Please try the blue mac and cheese. .. yummy! !!"}
{"text":"Had the classic beagle hamburger today - it was good, waffle-fries were the accompaniment.  It was a Tuesday at lunch, so not many people where there - was pretty quiet.  I'll try it one night to better get a feel for the ambiance."}
{"text":"I really liked this spot - first time here and I like the bar area and the outback area.  I only drank here this time, but the table next to us ordered food and it look really good.  I could only imagine eating after four or five beers and it tasting really good too.

The bar girl was great too!

I'll be back."}
{"text":"First time in my life I've ever walked out of a restaurant. Waited over an hour for breakfast. Waitress apologized and gave us the option to leave which I thought was poor customer service."}
{"text":"My first time eating at Jackbeagles, it was actually fairly well. It was on a Wednesday night (15 July). The food was actually done and the customer service was actually comparable favourably with other burger joints I've been to. However, the last time, I feel as if they were sequestered (on a Wednesday Night 22 July). My order came within a reasonable timeframe, yet the order was not the way I ordered it. I ordered a burger with no jalapenos or Chipotle aioli. Secondly, they must remember that the customers do not want to see the underwear of your cooks, so their britches needed to be pulled up at all times. Thirdly, when someone say \"well done\", it should be well done, not medium rare. I would love not to die of botulism. 

I'll give Jackbeagles another try within the next 3 weeks. If no noticeable changes occur, I'll not return."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  The Mac n Cheese with garlic was spectacular.  My group had wings, hot dogs and burgers.  Everyone enjoyed the meal despite being BLASTED be cold air.
THEN..... the check came.  It was half price wing night.  3 people at the table ordered 12 wings.  On the menu 6 wings are $5.99 and 12 wings are $9.99.  This should put our orders at $5 each.  We were all charged for 2 orders of 6 totaling $6.50.  None of that makes any sense to me except incorrect ordering on her part, possibly trying to up the check average, and incorrect pricing on the menu.
Everyone at the table is in the bar/restaurant business and noticed the problem too late.  This will definitely stay in our head the next time we want to go out to eat, which we do a LOT."}
{"text":"Definitely a NoDa staple. Mostly come here for drinks and some music, but the food is good also. They always have a great assortment of local and not so local craft brews on draught. Great specials throughout the week, great patio area, dog-friendly, can't ask for much more."}
{"text":"So, I'm updating my review based on my great experience Wednesday 6/29. This our favorite spot in NoDa. Consistently, they have some of the best bar food, burgers and mac & cheese I've ever tasted. However, we've been dining here since 12' and the service is always the worst part. I don't want to say what all I have witnessed from the FOH staff but it has been awful at times. I know it's NoDa and all but service is service..whether at a bar or white table cloth. Last night, our server Logan won us back over. As a server myself, I saw that this guy went over and beyond! He greeted us promptly, brought our dog a bucket of water, and was just a friendly guy who made us feel welcome and taken care of. Logan rocks!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Nice variety on the burger menu and the Mac and cheese is really good.  The service was wonderful and I liked the atmosphere. Nice selection of bottle/can beer as well as plenty of great choices on tap.  Prices can't be beat.
Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Definitely a place to drink. And sadly, I came on a day that I didn't want to drink. My brother and I came upon this place hearing good things about it. I, wasn't hungry (surprised?) but my brother was so he got a meal and told me to order some appetizers. 

We ordered the mac n cheese and the buried treasure which was covered in beef, cheese, on top of waffle fries. They were delicious. The mac n cheese wasn't bad but the only problem I had was it was a little on the salty side. Though, I didn't have a good beer to wash it down so that's probably why it's a little salty. If you have some alcohol with that I bet it would taste awesome.

The service. Not bad. When we went in there it was during late afternoon so it was sort of dead. But, that doesn't matter when the waiter was nice and offered her favorites on the menu that made our decision for what to get. 

All in all, I would come here to drink and eat. But I want to emphasize, next time I'm definitely going to get a beer with my food."}
{"text":"The Sunday brunch breakfast burrito was unreal. Best breakfast is have had in a long while. The coffee was great. Staff is very friendly. Will be returning often!"}
{"text":"Believe it or not the Hotdogs are ggggrrrreeaaaat! I had that plus the hidden treasure fries with homemade chili  (great), pulled pork, peppers and onions, and slaw. Amazing! I truly enjoyed it n so did my friends. I looooovvveed the slaw, so good!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for atmosphere, this place has it. If you're looking for delicious food, I'd warn you to steer clear of here.

Came here on a busy Friday night. Tables turned quick enough for there to not be a wait. We walked right in and sat right down. We looked at the beer menu and while a decent size, I wasn't impressed. I don't know much about beer but I do love fun beers and I think there were about 4 of 5 to choose from. Not my style so I didn't order-no biggie. I'm here for the food anyway.

My boyfriend was in the mood for a burger and I was intrigued by their Mac n cheese. There were only three burgers to choose from. Meh. I got a pretty basic spicy one. Buzz words for my burger: roasted jalapeño, wasabi mayo, pepper jack cheese. Yes. I love spicy. I also decided upon the Stadium Mac n Cheese because it had beer cheese and a hot dog and pretzel on top(yum! Sounded like it was going to bring me back to my baseball fan years). My boyfriend and I are low carb so we got no buns for our burgers. ( I wanted my carbs to be from the Mac n cheese since that was a different dish). My boyfriend got the bacon and blue cheese burger and fried mushrooms.

Everything came out at the same time. The fried mushrooms, which should take maybe 5 min to make, came out last. *Confused emoji* My mac n cheese  looked and tasted like it had been sitting in the window, but unfortunately I think that just how it was supposed to taste.

I was bummed by everything we ate. My burger was definitely a basic burger. Like, those burgers you eat just because you're drinking. The ones that just make you sad and depressed about your life. There was nothing fun about this...actually I take that back, that wasabi mayo was pretty good and different, but that was the only thing I liked about the burger. Easily could have made one 1,000x better at home. 
My Mac and Cheese. SAD SAD FACE! This dish had SO much potential! Beer cheese is amazing. This beer cheese was not. I tasted no beer at all. It's a STADIUM Mac n Cheese! I need beer flavor! The macaroni tasted like this cheap stuff my mom used to buy for us growing up. .99 cheap from a discount grocery store in a box by a brand so \"off\" you wonder if it's even made out of anything real. The same goes for the hotdog. Cheap skinny hotdogs. Man, when I go to a baseball game I'm going for the FOOD. Big fat steamed ballpark dogs! This, was not that. And lastly, the pretzel. Oh man. Here in my mind I was thinking it was a soft pretzel (because isn't that what you get at a baseball game?) but again, so much disappointment. It was a rock hard pretzel stick smashed in the back and sprinkled on my .99 cent macaroni. Wow. I was like, ultra disappointed. So much that the whole night I was talking about going out on the town because we NEVER go out. Yeah, after this dinner I just wanted to go to bed. Which we did. I had three bites of my Mac n cheese and left it. Literally that bad. 

I feel like I need not to go into explanation about how disappointing the fried mushrooms were.They weren't those big fat juicy kind. Very dry and shriveled. Soooo basically you're eating fried batter. 

Here's the thing. My boyfriend, who doesn't care a lick about food. Said everything was great. Haha. 
So long story short: if you care not about food and want a great social spot, come here. The atmosphere was pretty fun. But if you enjoy taste and innovative food then this is not the place for you!"}
{"text":"Amazing fried mushrooms, they taste just like chicken tenders! And the drinks are nice and strong."}
{"text":"Happened in to this upbeat little spot last weekend. Modern, friendly vibe and modest but spot on decor. My son had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with Ranch instead of the standard issue Blue cheese. My wife has the Cheese Steak with wiz. Very good looking sandwich and cooked excellent. I had the daily special which was Chicken Bacon Tacos. We shared the Blue Mac n Cheese and it was delicious. The waffle fries are fabulous! Excellent, friendly service and a great experience. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the breakfast because it is all I have tried, but it was great. I had two eggs with bacon(lots of it), and grits. Toast was great, the only problem is that it was too much food. I love the atmosphere, the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"The brunch here was great. It's a small spot with not much seating but they do offer seating outside. The waitress was nice. The breakfast potatoes were a fave for my girls. We wanted to try something different and we give it two thumbs up. They have a small brunch menu which works well. Their signature breakfast was amazing and their toast was thick and delish. Sorry I did not take any pictures but yes, gonna go for it again."}
{"text":"I'm hoping we went on a off night. We travel for work from LA and exactly a year ago we both had their blue cheese burger and loved it! Went back last week and it was disappointing, couldn't taste the blue cheese and it just completely missed the mark... I wonder what has changed. Our waiter was very friendly."}
{"text":"I stopped in hear last Friday night with a friend on a whim. I was skeptical of this place since I have never heard of Jack Beagles, upon my party finding a table a waitress quickly came over to take our order. She was nice but her knowledge of the food menu and beers were very limited. I eat primarily vegan so I thought I wouldn't be able to find anything great to eat I was wrong!!! I had the Primavera vegetable Flat Wrap wish was absolutely delicious!! They also had a nice outdoor patio with a great band playing!!"}
{"text":"If you're going to JackBeagles, you're getting one of the mac and cheeses. That's just a fact, right? There's a mini menu of mac and cheeses to cover any taste-buds which means order them all if you show up with a severe mac and cheese craving. 

During my visit, I went with the classic mac and cheese as a side to the outdoor-style hot dog (outdoor-style = grilled) to accompany an order of wings for the table. Personally, the mac and cheese was the winner, followed by the wings and then the hot dog. I think I should've ordered more toppings for the hot dog so that's on me to change the next time I visit.

I visited on a beautiful Saturday afternoon right after the brunch was finished being served and sat out on the back patio since one of my dining companions was a sweet little pup. There were plenty of dogs out back that provided some entertainment for the humans and fellow dogs.

I found Jackbeagles to be extremely laid back with surprisingly good food."}
{"text":"The burger of the week was good! But the waitress mumbled and I didn't realize it was the only $5.00 burger! We were not even offered a Burger Passport until she wanted to get an attitude about it at time to pay! The other cheese burger was horrible and the two different types of mac and cheese were plain and microwaved to reheat!! Not impressed at all!"}
{"text":"What a great surprise!  JackBeagles has been around for a year and a half, and it's so low-key that we drove right past it and had to narrow down the location based on the address (it's in between Cabo Fish Taco and Salvador Deli, but we didn't see a sign).  

We got there around 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning, and the place was about half full.  It's definitely a bar that just happens to serve food, and we were immediately greeted when we walk in.  Great service, friendly staff and absolutely delicious food.  We both ordered the Beagle Breakfast, which is 2 eggs, bacon/sausage, potatoes/grits and toast/biscuit, and neither of us could stop raving about how good it was.  I'm not even a biscuit fan, but theirs was awesome - light and dense all at the same time.  The eggs were super fluffy, the sausage patties were sweet and smoky, and the potatoes had a little kick.  The menu is fairly limited, but this is definitely a case of do a handful of things and do them really well.  Next time, I might have to get the S%!# on a Shingle, just for the fun of it."}
{"text":"Friendly service, good food, reasonable prices... What more can a girl ask for in a casual bar in NoDa? What? Amazing Mac 'n' Cheese you say? Why, yes! They have that too!

I'll certainly be back. The bartenders and kitchen staff (who you can see because of the open-kitchen floor plan) are extremely jovial and friendly. Everyone on the wait staff was smiling and joking around. It seems like a place where everyone is accepted for who they are. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Went back to the old Jack Beagle for brunch after church and it was a 180 on all the stuff I had an issue with.

Everyone was friendly, was greeted at the door, my coffee and water full, and my waitress was fantastic !!!

The food is always great and this time the food and the service matched. 

Tip: if you want something so bad for you but is soooooo delicious get the shhh on a shingle... My personal fave.

I will be back and I don't have to convince the Mrs to come back for her fave pancakes . Let's keep this standard going... Awesome !

Side note : I started this review a few months ago but I used the phone app...... boo on the phone app.... Ive been back a few times and all issues I had before with brunch have been solved.... great job guys !!!!"}
{"text":"Our occasional after-hours, late night stop for some excellent chow.  We've ordered the chicken tenders, mac n cheese, fries, and tried the jack mac this last time.  WOW!  Order this next time you go.  One day I'd like to try the breakfast I've been hearing great things about."}
{"text":"This is one of the best spots in NoDa.  Despite the fact that they didnt hire me in college (still salty after 2 years), its a great casual spot to drink and eat. Food is very consistent, service is good, and the atmosphere reminds me of home. Not for the health conscious tho as a heads up."}
{"text":"This is a great find!

I actually went to Jack Beagles for the first time beacuse I was directed there by a sign on the door of Salvador Deli (they were remodeling). The food was great (I had takeout that time). I went back yesterday and was amazed that I had found a new HOT SPOT. They are currently building an awesome back patio with a stage and I can't wait for them to finish. As for the food, I had the Blue Cheese Burger with fries and an order of the boneless wings in the Spicy Jack sauce. My friend had the Philly Cheesesteak (he's from Philly). We were totally impressed by the quality and flavor of the food. The burger was cooked exactly how I had asked, and the fries are KILLER. If you're going to get something that introduces you to JB's get the wings with the spicy Jack sauce. I could probably eat 10 lbs. of those! 

In addition to the great food is the excellent prices on their craft beers. They do not carry as many as some places in NoDa, but the selection is varied and CHEAP. I will be coming here at least once a week because I want to support places that provide quality to their customers."}
{"text":"I came here because i wanted a local spot with some good food and this didn't disappoint. It's located in Noda and you may almost pass it if you're not looking. I walked and was told
I could sit anywhere. The waiter came fast. We order their fries that come with chili, cheese, and slaw. They were amazing! I wanted to eat the whole thing but had to force myself to stop. I ordered two hotdogs. One had slaw and brown mustard the other had pickles, mustard, slaw, and bacon. They were amazing. I could of had two more. I was craving hot dogs and this hit the spot!! I'll be back soon! Plus they have the best fries ever !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in town. Always satisfied with the food, atmosphere and drinks. The Long Islands are the best! And during the week the performances are good."}
{"text":"Bring back late night treasure fries!!! They shut it down before 12....so not worth going for the one most delicious thing on the menu now that they basically stop serving any french fries by 11pm. The air conditioning was dripping water on us the entire time. And anytime after 11pm they are completely unhelpful with any customization of menu items."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar and late night go to!  This place has a awesome back patio, cheap drinks and the perfect menu for after a few of those drinks.  Wings and Cheesesteaks are both great; but the go to for me is the mac and cheese bowls- so many options and always hits the spot (the Mexi-Mac is my favorite with a good amount of spice!).  For being a \"dive bar\" the menu is surprisingly large; perhaps not the most vegetarian options but if you are a vegetarian just order two mac bowls and you will leave happy!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to go no matter what time of the day/night. Bands on the weekend pull in a good crowd out back. Hotdogs and their famous mac & cheese after midnight are always a great idea. And breakfast on the weekends will fill you up (I suggest the steak omelet!)"}
{"text":"Ultimate hot dog spot! I've had a couple deluxe rippers and the pork tacos here and they're all crazy good! I'm usually not a big hot dog fan but it was hard not to try an island dog when the opportunity presents itself. Plus Bird songs Mexi Cali on tap puts this spot over the top for me!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! I wish I lived closer I would be a regular! They have a cool outside bar area along with a funky indoor area. Staff is laid back. Sometimes it takes a minute to get noticed once you sit down but after that your in the clear. Best Mac and cheese ever! I honestly have never had a bad meal here! Perfect spot for a relaxing meal!"}
{"text":"Jack beagles is definitely one of the best stops you could make in Noda for an all around great experience. My boyfriend and I were looking for some late night dinner but at the same time wanted to try something we hadn't had a million times. The food was great honestly better than I expected and the service was awesome! Alex took great care of us she was clearly knowledgeable and seemed to really like her job. They were super busy and she was the only bartender but we never wanted for a thing. The prices were good drinks were strong and I loved the fact they served humanely raised grass fed beef, honestly the only thing that kept me from 5 stars was I that I was hoping for a vegetarian option other than just side items but all in all a must stop!"}
{"text":"Decided to drop in after catching a show nearby. Loved the atmosphere, food was so so but not terrible. I had the hot garlic wings and the blue blk mac and cheese I think it was. I would be inclined to come back. I was a bit put off at our table of 3 being asked for a credit card to hold onto before we even ordered. If this is the norm maybe it should be posted for all to see."}
{"text":"Went over here last weekend for brunch, but we missed it. Ended up staying for a burger. The burger was great! I had bacon, cheese and mushrooms on it! Delicious! I ordered a side salad instead of fries and I was pleasantly surprised. I have also been here several times for drinks and always had fun. The first time I ever came to Jack Beagles Zach Galafanakis was in there. He had been shooting a movie in town and came in for a beer. It was pretty great."}
{"text":"Ratings based on Sunday brunch.

Service...4 stars.  Very well attended to, kept coffee cups filled and checked on us frequently.  Corrected an error in the order quickly and without making a request to do so.

Food...4 stars.  Very large portions, and the food was very flavorful and excellent.  I had a more traditional breakfast, whereas my spouse had a gigantic omelette that I helped her finish.

Value...4 stars.  For the amount of food given, this was an excellent value.

Ambience...3 stars.  This is a divey type of bar.  There was outside back seating, which we did not choose, so can't say how that was.  The most important thing was that it was clean enough.

Overall, a very good place to go for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"JackBeagles has recently become my \"go-to\" for a weekend breakfast...it's like a Budweiser: always fills me up, and never lets me down. 

I think it's always a good idea for a restaurant to keep a simple menu, execute a couple of items that you do really well, and don't overcomplicate or spread yourself too thin by trying to appease everyone. I think JBs really embraces this concept; they stick to a few basics, throw in a special or two, and keep the prices very reasonable. 

As for the building, I've always just walked in the front door (push don't pull), and sat right at the bar. I'd probably just classify it more as \"counter-service\" than bar, as the kitchen is visible and somewhat open, and the service up front has always been efficient. Side note: I like that the coffee mugs are just a random assortment from local businesses that they probably got for free...It's kinda like a koozie, it's always better to collect them rather than buy them.  

The inside has a real laid-back vibe, and you'll usually catch a couple of people at the bar completing a crossword puzzle, or just there sipping on some coffee. Striking up conversations with others is typically easy & comfortable. 

As mentioned before, I've only been for breakfast---but I'll definitely check out their lunch/dinner options if I'm ever bar hopping around NoDa some night."}
{"text":"Literally obsessed with Jack Beagles! If you're in NoDa and wondering where to go for beer and tunes, it's Jack Beagles. They are very well known for their mac&cheese. They always have love bands, their food is so amazing and they have a great beer selection. I love the service here too, very NoDa, very cool, gotta come here!"}
{"text":"Good wings, chill atmosphere, friendly bartenders, strong drinks... what more can you ask for. It's right off the CATS Blueline with $0.50w wing Wednesday (after 5p). Don't meet me there, beat me there."}
{"text":"Great food and service!Our server David was so kind! He checked on us regularly and gave excellent service.The other employees there were very kind also. They loved petting my dog and telling my stories about their own dogs.I give this place 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Jack's has awesome food and an awesome atmosphere. This place is always busy on the weekend but for a good reason. They often host an open mic night that is always fun. It is a bit small inside, but features more open space in the back which is outside. Having the bar on both the inside and outside provides rather quick service. Don't limit yourself to just alcohol, they have tasty bar food that is sure to please your taste buds."}
{"text":"Really, I come here for the beer and the food is generally an afterthought. I have friends who are excited by their brunch and mac n cheese, but I find their food to be generally bland or oversalted. It's not bad, but not great. 

It's generic American with a little classy and a little trashy thrown in. For instance, they have a blue cheese mac, but they also have a cheesesteak-based version of \"shit on a shingle\" as a  brunch option. Their inspiration seems diverse. 

I was most recently there to try their brunch. The servers are usually friendly and ours was no exception. She was very new though, in the \"make many trips, forget drinks, don't bring a spoon to stir the coffee\" kind of way. Everyone's gotta start somewhere though, so we forgave the inefficiencies. However, when she brought out our meals piecemeal from the kitchen, my patience waned as my eggs cooled, waiting for the rest of my food to arrive. 

When it did, my \"shit on a shingle\" was filling, a good portion size, yet slightly too salty.  There wasn't enough gravy on the steak to actually cover the Texas toast and keep it moist. I had ordered scrambled eggs on the side to also eat with the gravy and not only were they only warm by the time my food arrived, they were also not cooked very well -- more like a fried egg that happened to have been stirred a couple times. The home fries, however, were delicious and well seasoned. My dining companion liked the whole meal though, dubbing it \"so white trash\" and \"right up my alley.\" 

She got the French toast and it tasted good, though they went a little nuts with the powdered sugar on top.  Hers was standard brunch fare, simple and tasty."}
{"text":"Ordered the big south burger with a side of waffle fries. The burger was delicious and had no issues with my meal. Our server was friendly and nice but she seemed to be the only server there. My only complaint was that all our food was brought out at different times."}
{"text":"I'm glad the other reviewers saw what I did and I'm not just like...their biggest fan or something.

Love the staff, love the beers, love the atmosphere...I knew the first time I  visited it's \"my\" bar in NoDa, and it's always where I head."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with two teenagers and everyone loved their food.  Double bacon burger was a huge hit especially the yummy bun.  Another had wings...buffalo style.  And I of course had my usual pulled pork tacos which were fresh and had great textures.  We all had the Mac and cheese.....fantastic way to warm up on a cold afternoon!"}
{"text":"-Amazing food
-Unbeatable prices
-Reliable and fair service
-Fantastic patrons

Jack Beagles' has all of the above. I moved to Charlotte in April 2012, having never been a big fan of bars and pubs. Too much riff-raff. Jack Beagles doesn't have that problem. I enlisted about five months later but I still go to this bar every single time I return home! I always get the same great service with the same great prices. I've eaten almost everything on the menu and nothing disappoints me. 

I met one of the owners once and frankly, he looks like everyone else working there. Jack Beagles' is my favorite bar anywhere and I'll gladly continue supporting this place. Special shout out to Henry, Alex, the cooks, and the hilarious DJ who's name escapes me at the moment. He's always got something great playing."}
{"text":"As long as the doors are open we will keep coming back! Drinks can be pricy if not ordered from the drink specials. 
The BEST food! Bleu cheese and bacon mac and cheese? Yes please! The fried mushrooms are so good and served with horseradish sauce. Cheesesteak, hummus, beer! It's win/win!"}
{"text":"I really like this bar. It's a bar with good bar music and good bar food. Their fried mushrooms are delicious portabello slices with a great breading and yummy horseradish sauce. Go for the bigger dog- ripper style, you won't regret it. Finally, the Mac and cheese is amazing. Totally amazing. The back bar is a great space, dog friendly- though the music may be too loud, depending on your dog's noise sensitivity."}
{"text":"Great new spot in noda!!  Perfect for art crawl night because the patio outback is right next door to where the bands set up outside the deli.  There are picnic tables and tiki torches all set up under huge trees so you feel like you are in someone's backyard instead of just a bar.  The service here last night was awesome and super attentive.  Attracts a great ecletic crowd, not too young but just fun people from the neighborhood.  They have a great beer selection for those of us who are always ISO IPAs!!!  Cant wait to be back!!!  :-D"}
{"text":"The whole NoDa area is very hipsteresque.   Not really my cup of tea.

But after seeing JackBeagles here on yelp and getting equally good reviews from the locals we decided to check it out.

Draft beer selection is a little on the small side, but all 8 taps are craft brews.

Music playing has a 90s atmosphere to it.   When is the last time you heard New Kids On The Block?!

I had the bird pig hoagie special.   Chunks of chicken, bacon and BBQ sauce on a toasted hoagie bun.

The Mac n cheese was pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Again, I wish Yelp had half stars, because this was a 3.5 experience for me. 

I ordered the CHEESESTEAK with onions, green peppers, and mushrooms. I chose melted provolone as my cheese. I asked them to hold the mayo, because mayonnaise on a Philly cheesesteak is sacrilegious. I drank a STONE IPA, which paired well with the sandwich. (Harpoon IPA was on tap, but I didn't notice that until later.) Total price for my meal was a few pennies over $12.

I sat at the bar and watched the short order cook prepare my meal, to see if I could learn any secrets - I didn't. The cheesesteak took about ten minutes to arrive, smoldering lava hot. I liked the components, which were plentiful, and well cooked. The line cook used grilled steak, and definitely not \"Steak Ums.\" I especially enjoyed the nice crusty bread. The sandwich lacked something tastewise, which was hard to pin down. I'm not saying that it was bad, or that I was disappointed, it just lacked some \"oomph.\" There was no salt or pepper added to the meat, so that would have helped somewhat. At home, I would also have added a few shakes of garlic powder. Cheez Whiz would have added significantly to the authenticity of the taste. I've had better cheesesteaks, but I've had far, FAR worse. Portofino's/East still remains my benchmark for CLT. I haven't tried the food trucks - YET, but I will. 

My barstool neighbor was downing mixed drinks, and munching on WINGS with ranch dip and celery hearts. Both the drink and his food looked good.

A mother came in, accompanied by her small daughter. The female bartender told them that Jack Beagles makes a great BURGER. I watched this being prepared, and it surely looked delicious. I would probably order that next time. It seems that almost every other reviewer says their mac 'n cheese is amazing, so that would be a \"must try\" eventually as well. 

SERVICE was very good. The female bartender was friendly and properly attentive. I didn't have to wait for anything. There were a couple of loud young guys bragging on their drinking prowess, but no one was being overly obnoxious. The female bartender deftly kept them in check. 

I love the RELAXED ATMOSPHERE of Jack Beagle's and the wonderful LOCATION. 

There were large size TV's over the bar. 

I found the place to be very CLEAN.  

This place makes me wish that I lived in NODA."}
{"text":"Really liked the atmosphere of this place, we went here for breakfast on a Saturday and everything was good.  If you want breakfast in a unique setting this is your place.  We arrived fairly early so seating wasn't an issue but it could be a problem later."}
{"text":"We just love this place. The decor is just simple old keeping the vibe of what NODA is and we love that. Putting out great quality food with no frills. The Mac and cheese options here are amazing along with the taste and the price is only $5 which is incredible. Go for the Mac and cheese u HAVE to."}
{"text":"I went to Jack Beagles after hearing and reading reviews. The atmosphere was great and I was ready for some great Hot dogs in the Charlotte area. 4 different hot dogs were ordered at my table and when being served all were so wrong that we looked confused. Might I add that it too almost 35 minutes to receive our food at 6:30pm on a Tuesday. Questioned by the waitress we explained that we couldn't figure out how to give the right hot dog to who ordered what. The food was returned for a recook and 5-7 minutes later we had our correct hot dogs. However, this time the hot dogs were still cold, the buns were cold, toppings were perfect, and the fries were from the original plate. I tasted the jalapeno relish and fell in LOVE!! Regardless of how bad the first visit was I will be back to retry and finally have a hot dog location in Charlotte. TRY THE JALAPENO RELISH!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite neighborhood dives in NoDa! They are dog friendly via the back patio (heated in the winter). Wednesday wing night is my personal favorite time of the week to go ...especially because open mic night is always interesting. On the weekends they have live music which is always fun. Friendly locals, great wings, great beer selection and stiff drinks...need I say more? Not sure why it took my so long to write a review?!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way here since we were on the hip side of town and were pretty much famished...  Luckily I don't have a problem talking to strangers because I knew where this place was supposed to be, but I saw no indication that it was actually there... If I hadn't asked the nice ID checking guy standing at the door, we'd have walked right past it... Can we at least get him a shirt that says JackBeagles? lol

I'm going to go ahead and put my cards on the table... If you put anything spicy in front of me, the battle is already half won... I love a nice, bold, spicy dish and that Jack Mac is the definition of delicious in my book... It's the perfect combination of cheesy, creamy and spicy... I will absolutely be back for that... The boyfriend got the Chili Mac and while it wasn't bad, the chili pretty much overpowered the mac... It was good chili, though...

We got two of the philly sandwiches... I got the regular one which was absolutely amazing... The bread was soft on the inside with a nice crust around, the fillings were nicely sliced and were packed inside great... I hate having to wrangle a messy sandwich... lol The boyfriend got the philly with the pepperonis and it was a hit with him... I liked it, too, even though he drowned it in mayonnaise... (Ick.) 

You know, it was the kind of night where I ordered a beer and it was decent, but I honestly can't even remember the name of it... And I didn't write it down... Sorry about that, guys... lol  They do have a solid beer selection, though, so I'd give it a whirl...

There's a new patio out back, apparently, but this hungry girl didn't make it past the plate this time... Next time we head in, I'll update..."}
{"text":"Breakfast is AMAZING! I've had the eggs Benedict, omelet, and waffles and they have each been delicious. Service is great and the mimosas are also a must-have. Nighttime bar is a fantastic tome - local bands will play and the scene is cozy."}
{"text":"I LOVE HOT WINGS! Wild Wing is the only place I have found that has hot enough wings that are too spicy for me. However, I have found another. Jack Beagles have this wicked sauce that tastes sweet at first and then all of a sudden it kicks your ass. It was so hot that I had to go through two golden monkeys within ten minutes to try and cool my mouth off. I could only eat a few of them and after my big tall glass of milk arrived, I went ahead and ordered the philly cheese with Jack mac which is mac and cheese with a little kick. They were both awesome but I might need to tone it down on the hot sauce after being put in my place."}
{"text":"Nice! I was in search of a place with mimosas for Sunday brunch and this one does $5 double mimosas, woohoo! It's in NoDa and the atmosphere is like a sports bar without TVs - very casual and fun. The food was delicious and inexpensive. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Last night one of my roommates were in the area for Noda Crawl. After walking around for a bit we decided to stop for some dinner in Jackbeagles. After looking through Yelp earlier in the day, I read a lot of good reviews on the various Mac and Cheeses so I was enthusiastic to try it for myself.

Let me tell you, my bowl of their signature Jack Mac did NOT disappoint. It was everything promised in the description: a perfect balance of spicy and cheesy flavors. You can tell that the chefs at Jackbeagles put the time into making each bowl of mac and cheese in house (none of that throwing frozen noodles into the microwave business). It was the kind of food that left me feeling sad when I scooped up the last bite.

As far as the venue goes, it was a small space with limited indoor seating. There were tables outside but we were able to snag a table inside in the seat-yourself restaurant. The decor wasn't anything fancy or unique, but who needs it with Mac and cheese so good? Some servers seemed more enthusiastic than others but overall I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Breakfast hoagi is huge, u could split it. Very flavorful.

The taters were unbelievable. Crispy with a kick. One on the best tater sides Ive ever had.

The Shit on a Shingle was the best breakfast there. Steak and texas toast smothered in country gravy. I love this shit.

The mimosas were a little pricey."}
{"text":"I'm sure there's a cleaver reason this place has a name like it does but I couldn't capture it during my first visit.  Noda is chock full of spots like this one.  Unassuming, undercover and generally hole in the wall type places.  That's not a bad thing but I think this place just blends in.  Blends in until you walk to the back and out to the patio.  

The best asset is the back patio and it looks like they are putting more money into to make it even nicer.  Nice little stage for a local band to play certainly creates a nice environment to come and kick back."}
{"text":"Had a GREAT night at Jack Beagles- there was a band playing Saturday and the place was rockin. This is our new favorite bar."}
{"text":"Come on a busy weekend and pray you can find a seat. Food is good and so are the drinks. Great atmosphere with live music. Best part is its dog friendly"}
{"text":"In my opinion, JackBeagles is one of the best bars in Charlotte. They have some of the most excellent food and you can never go wrong with their Jack Mac or Buried Treasure Fries. This is also an excellent place to go watch the game with your friends. They seem to always have some kind of live music whether it is an open mic night or an awesome local band like Swim in the Wild. This place can get pretty crazy on the weekends like any of the bars in NoDa but it is always a good time and never disappoints. They also have a pretty awesome selection of beer with usually at least one really nice craft beer on special for $2-$3. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have one phrase for you...... Mac-n-cheese.  And when I say that Jack Beagles does it right, I am not kidding. Who would ever have thought that this NoDa bar would have gourmet style Macaroni and cheese???  Well thank goodness my friend who had indulged in a drunken binge of trying some random menu choices stumbled on this.  We tried the traditional and the bacon and blue cheese one....... Omg.  Really, the pasta is traditional elbow macaroni and comes served in these large ramekin bowls, which means they are made for individual servings! Which means you don't have to share!!!!  The cheese was so melty and gooey..... The flavors were spot on! A nice bar to hit, if you are looking for a patio spot, too (in the back).  I am shamed to say that the Mac and cheese is all I've had here.... When it's that good, do you need anything more? No....."}
{"text":"Great local spot for good food & drinks!! Excellent wings & Mac&cheese! Service is great, friendly staff and clean restaurant! We visit frequently and always pleased!! Drink specials are awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite spot in NoDa, non-brewery. I've celebrated New Years, Halloween, St Patties day, and Just Drink days here, and loved every minute. Top tier pub food, shockingly good in my opinion. Always interesting art on the wall, great specials, and a superb place to bring friends. Meet here for a drink too, wonderful selection of bottles and cans, and the drafts are well chosen, said the beer snob."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place before, but hadn't had the chance to go. It's the kind of place that it's easy to miss unless you're looking for it. I dropped in for some late night noms the other night though, and was very pleased. 

I wasn't very hungry so I just got fried mushrooms, expecting the little button mushrooms you usually get. Boy was I surprised when these giant slices of fried goodness appeared before me! They went awesome with the horseradish sauce that came with it, a nice change from the typical ranch. My friend got a burger and it looked incredible. I can't wait to find myself hungry in NoDa again."}
{"text":"So Im going to start by saying I do not like the new menu change in pricing. Thats part of the reason why people would come in. You could have a beer and a meal for six dollars! Where else in charlotte could you do that! And trust me just because the bill was cheap it didnt effect my tipping it made me want to tip the waitress more! Overall its a great place to eat; burgers are great and you can get them cooked however you like. But since you uped the pricing can you atleast have a dollar beer special! PBR or something!"}
{"text":"Classic local spot in NODA to drink beer and eat wings. Came after work for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised by the beer selection and the array of Mac and cheese they had. (YOU MUST GET THE MAC AND CHEESE).  I didn't care for the Philly cheesesteak sandwiches but the chili mac was rrreeeeaaaallllyyyyyy ggggoooooooodddddd. I sat outside, which I probably won't do again because of how how hot it was, but a decent  amount of space on the inside. You can bring your furry friend and listen to live music in the back. Great place for cheap eats, beers, and good times."}
{"text":"I arrived at JackBeagle ready for a tasty beer. I love porters; I am a fan of the whole chipotle porter sensation. When I see a beer of this variety available on draft I typically ask for a taste so that I can decide if I would like an entire pour.  I don't need anything more than a drip on my tongue to make up my mind. I found it a bit unnecessary to charge $1 for a taste of this beer. They had Lagunitas IPA so I stuck with an old favorite because I was off put at paying to try the porter. 

The servers were attentive in replenishing beverages outside and the prices for beer were as expected. The patio was nicely heated with plenty of seating. I give JackBeagles the thumbs up and will probably have drinks here again but just can't say it is anything more than average."}
{"text":"An incredible gastropub with a huge patio in the rear just perfect for outdoor summer fun. Mean burgers!!!  Excellent Mac and cheese, and a nice draft list, not too big not too small.   You will not be disappointed.... Enjoy"}
{"text":"First time here and this is my kind of dive. I had the \"Shit on a stick\" (Yes that's it's name) and it was pretty good. Paired with a local beer and the servers are pretty good also"}
{"text":"SO FUN. That's exactly what I thought when I breezed through the doors of this place. A mix of peoples, I found a seat immediately and ordered up a dogfishhead pint and gazed at the menu with a small excitement that only comes when I see piles and piles of options for everything. Where to start - the hot dogs which you can get cooked 4 different ways? The Treasure Fries that you can get no less than 8 toppings on?! THERE IS JUST SO MUCH COOL STUFF GOING ON HERE!!!!

The red lighting, exposed brick, small bar, open plan - I love the decor and vibe. The service is quick, friendly and unpretentious ~ and the food? Zing! While they weren't having a great fry night as told to me by the human frymeter that is Tonya, I went with 2 hot dogs and the pasta salad on the side. Hate on me if you will, but I looooove pasta salad and I think it's awesome that this place offers it! It was delish - mayo based with feta, tomatoes, dill and celery. Yum! As for my dogs, I had them smoked with jalepeno relish, chili, slaw and mustard. Boinngggg! I don't even like hot dogs, but these things made me smile big time.

Price wise, this place is ON POINT with my beers, dogs and side coming in at under $11 - I felt like I was ripping good ol' JB off! Will definitely be coming back a lot more now that I know the relaxed, yummy place that awaits across from the sweet NoDa firestation."}
{"text":"the place to be when craving a philly cheesesteak and especially when in noda. or to rip up some paper towels and put them back together like a makeshift puzzle"}
{"text":"I'm getting too old lol for such loud noise called music but the food was good no delicious.   Meaty juicy plump wings full of flavor and man the Mac n cheese  was on point.  I went with the basic Mac n cheese but will try other options the next time!  The philly steak sandwich was huge n oh so good! My 17 month old grandson thoroughly enjoyed his Mac n cheese n hot dog!!! 4 adults n 1 toddler and we all gave it thumbs up!  NoDa seems to offer unique but pleasing dining options and this is one of them for sure.   Good prices too!"}
{"text":"This place is nice for just sitting on the back porch and NOT ordering anything.  I went here on Wednesday *(the supposedly 1/2 off WINGS - NOT).
We ordered a dozen wings - oh there is an UPCHARGE for everything ! So after deciding what we wanted I told the waiter -  I would like this flavor -- Oh that's an UPCHARGE, to this SIDE which was to be $1 - Oh that an UPCHARGE. This was all told AFTER the fact.... okay so we settled with the non-UPCHARGED items and ordered.  The menu stated the wings come with Celery - nothing about CARROTS! (which I HATE). The WINGS came out all FROST BIT - so dried up and hard it was UN-eatable!  By the way on my way out there was a table of 'OBVIOUS REGULARS' Big Barley Men - unlike petite me - who had FABULOUS FAT, MOIST & MEATY WINGs - so there is the FAVORITISM also!

The waiter also DID NOT GIVE THE WINGS 1/2 OFF!  After all that & having LOUSY DRIED UP NO MEAT on WINGS served to us -- they were NOT EVEN 1/2 off as promised!  They charged us 7.50 for $9.99 - so they don't even know the MATH!

Doubt this place will last long at all if they continue doing business.

To the Owners of Jack Beagles

Here is a thought for them - STOP UPCHARGING things - it's a MARKETING thing that people come in for a special & try one of YOUR specialties... you think they will come back again?! HUH? Instead you give the lousy flavor out of the can chili that was ssooo nasty & Thin & Burnt (nothing like in their viedo of over night soaked potatoes) which were over cooked not -wedged (as I was told they were) French Fries - I would have called them CHIPS not French Fries cuz they looked like Potato chips to me - round cuts cut in half.

Well you should think about marketing and making people WANT to come back but I bet you won't"}
{"text":"Pretty good for bar food, I like the area, pretty crowded but quick service. I would come back when in the mood for bar food. The drinks could be better, but decent enough"}
{"text":"Some of the best food in noda! If you leave there without getting the mac & cheese you are doing yourself a massive disservice. Pork tacos, turf and turf, and fried mushrooms are worth your time!"}
{"text":"Jack Beagles harkens back to NoDa days of old... Before the slick new restaurants and shiny new apartments moved in and gobbled up all the parking spaces. It's a little rough around the edges and grimey but it fills a niche. Enjoyed a few too many beers at Salud and need a little greasy food to sober up? Head to Jack Beagles! Arrive to Haberdish to find a 2-hour wait and want to grab a few drinks while you wait? Head to Jack Beagles! Hung over as hell on Sunday and need some bar grub to bounce back? Head to Jack Beagles!

I try to avoid their draft beers as they always taste a little off. (I'm not sure they clean their lines enough for my admittedly snobby beer tastes.) Good news is they have a ton of bottles and cans. Plus prosecco. You can never go wrong with prosecco. 

They crank out some really good bar food. My favorites include the boneless wings with barbalo sauce and any/all their mac and cheeses. Ted loves their buried treasure fries. I always sneak a few and can't argue with waffle fries covered in cheese, onions, peppers, sausage, etc."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere. Would make a great Saturday afternoon watering hole to watch a band too. Had a hamburger, all was good."}
{"text":"Quirky hipster bar/restaurant with a great staff and wonderful menu. Had breakfast here. Ended up ordering \"Shit On  Shingle\" which was awesome. Great country cookin at a friendly place in a cool hood."}
{"text":"I come here quite often...love the breakfast, atmosphere is great in the evening, nice patio (dog friendly), no complaints here!  This will always be my \"go to\" spot when I want good food, service, and know I won't be disappointed.

The only issue some may find is parking.  If it's busy that's just NODA for you."}
{"text":"What is there not to like about JackBeagles. Great place...great food. I love the grilled chicken grits with jalapeños. Good drinks as well. I will definitely be heading back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Sunday breakfast in CLT. Best gravy (of their biscuits and gravy) you'll find. We've tried several options off their breakfast menu and haven't been disappointed yet. Oh--and the best part? It's ridiculously affordable."}
{"text":"Had mimosas and bloody Mary's and they were no bueno... Food was good but definitely won't order these drinks again."}
{"text":"The energy of this Charlotte restaurant makes you feel like you are in a city. It is a narrow restaurant. There is exposed bricks. It has a good energy that I feel like a lot of Charlotte restaurants are missing.

The outdoor area is fantastic and it looks like they keep adding more to it. There is usually good music.

The food- there is a solid breakfast/brunch crowd. It gets busy. The lunch/dinner menu is good. The hamburgers are juicy and cooked to order. 

The best thing is the Mac and cheese. There is a Mexi Mac type that is especially incredible. 

This place feels like a diner. It has a good, low key vibe. Go."}
{"text":"I didn't eat any food, just drinks...

We were walking around NoDa and were going to stop in one place that we were early for their show and there was a cover, so we walked around for a bit, planning to go back.

We heard music coming from JackBeagles and I was immediately drawn in to their open patio!  

Josh Daniels and Friends were playing and the music was great and so was the singing.  This is very chill and most people were just hanging at the bar.

There are plenty of seats outside though and lots of space to spread out and hang out.

Bathrooms were clean which was nice with that many people around!  I definitely would like to go again."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Cute little place. Nice bar and good drink choices. Their red pepper hummus was incredible and I'm super picky about hummus. The pita bread was nice and fresh, very warm. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Normally I would rate Jack Beagle's at least 4 stars, but this was a terrible experience. The problem appears to be they are not a breakfast joint. Took 35 minutes to get bacon and eggs and there were only 3 other tables in the place, all of whom already had their food. The server explained they were training kitchen staff. Toast was cold, eggs tasted like they had been cooked in a dirty pan, and the grits, which is the one thing I come here for tasted like instant. Huge disappointment. I guess we will stick with the dinner menu. 

Update: we've been to JB's twice since the lousy breakfast experience and both times were just awful. This place has really gone downhill over the past year. The service is friendly enough but SO SLOOOWWWW! I waited 46 minutes for this last night. It was not a complicated order, and when I asked the sever to check on it after 40 minutes the excuse I was given was \"the fries are taking awhile to cook.\" I told her to ditch the fries and give it to me to go. By the time we left it was 10:00 pm, and I just wanted to leave. So for $11 this is what I got...yea, I got charged extra for the sauce"}
{"text":"I will typically try the Mac and cheese wherever I go because, hey, why not?  What I can tell you is that Jack Beagles has the best mac and cheese in town.  With options like Blue Black Mac, Chili Mac, and Mexi Mac, what's not to like?  I've tried nearly all of them at this point and they are all stellar. My favorite though is probably the Blue Black Mac. Their burgers are good but there are definitely better in Charlotte (Cowbell and Kickstand to name a few). 

Not a place that necessarily sticks out in Noda but certainly a good choice for those tired of some of the staples in the area.  I like the fact that this is more of a low key spot where you can relax and grab a good meal. 

Oh, and by the way, they have a nice bar for those looking to grab a beer."}
{"text":"Cheap food? Yes. Good food? Thank you, yes. Dive-y yet hipster atmosphere? Check. Cute guys covered in tattoos behind the counter? Mama, hide'yo kids. 

A friend and I stopped here late night on a Thursday after a show at  Wine Up. We were hungry. They were miraculously still open and serving food. Sometimes a gal just lucks out. 

Steak sub? Get it. I know that's what I'm getting when I go back. Mmm."}
{"text":"This place its indeed one of my favorites in town. I love the rock theme behind it (the music selection is great) and the staff has always been friendly and welcoming each and every single time I have visited. Plus the food... It's extremely DELICIOUS. I had the Patti Melt and also the Chilli Mac N Cheese and each time it just got better, better and better. Plus, I had an ordered of waffle fries with cheese and gravy and lets just say it was delicious in all possible aspects. Anyway, I highly recommend this place to anyone that's stopping by NoDa and its seeking for a great bite."}
{"text":"Am not familiar with Charlotte,so I used Yelp to find a burger. The neighborhood is fun to walk in, the beer selection was ok, decor is industrial chic, Mac & Cheese was slightly above average, burgers were well cooked and tasty, fries were a bit dry. The fried portabella  mushrooms, with the horseradish sauce, are among the best foods I have ever eaten in my life. I live 2 hours from this restaurant and am now considering a road trip just for the mushrooms. Yes, they are that good."}
{"text":"Typical pub food nothing so great price not too bad and server was awesome first time visit but I would definitely try again"}
{"text":"Good food, decent beers, nice people, dog friendly. Groovy when there's live music too. Actually, GREAT burgers. And the burgers are antibiotic free, vegie fed cow. Bonus!"}
{"text":"Came in right as they opened so it was very empty, they were very friendly and quick. I got the special which was a hoagie sandwich with grilled chicken, pineapple puree, red onions and tomatoes, which was very good and the jack mac as the side and that was amazing. Looks like this would be a great place for drinks as well."}
{"text":"Brunch food was good and mimosas were heavy on the champagne, which I always appreciate. I got the Waco Eggs Benedict. Loved that it was on Texas Toast and the hollandaise was tasty! The dish overall was a little heavy, but that's to be expected. Overall, a solid hungover breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning at 10 am, sat down and ordered quickly. (The Shit on a Shingle and an order of eggs with sausage) The inside was busy--but not slammed by any means, and we watched as couples sat down next to us and received their orders within 10-15 minutes. 20 minutes pass... Still no word. Then 30 minutes.... Our waitress comes up to us and says she \"doesn't know what happened\" but it \"shouldn't be more than a few minutes.\" Now we are going on 45 minutes, all of the surrounding tables/bar stools have eaten and already left and have been reseated. Our waitress comes up again and gives a pretty insincere apology, saying to us \"it should be coming soon, but I don't know if you want to wait any longer or just leave.\" Since we waited so long, we figured we would give it a few more minutes. Yet another 10 minutes passed... So, hungry and frustrated and without a sincere apology or explanation, we walked out. Not proud of walking out, but an hour of waiting is inexcusable. Guess customer service wasn't a priority this day."}
{"text":"Get the Mac n cheese! It was oh so good and gooey. The perfect comfort food and the price was really good. Got a bowl of the jack Mac and split their dessert which was perfect for Fat Tuesday. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"This was one of the best burgers I have had in awhile. I would recommend the black and blue burger.   The beer is cold and cheap enough. Great atmosphere. What else  do you need to know? Stop reading this and go to JackBeagles now!"}
{"text":"I have neglected to review Jack Beagles for far too long. To me, this place is practically a NoDa staple these days. I can't even think of NoDa without it coming to mind. Nor can I think of mac and cheese without it coming to mind!

If you're up early you can take advantage of their quick and easy one-page breakfast menu with a selection of specialties, omelets or just a regular old American south breakfast - eggs, sausage or bacon, grits or hashbrowns, toast or biscuits. During the day and into your nightly escapades you can have yourself one of their many delectable [hot] dogs or a choice of 4 or 5 different kinds of mac and cheese. I personally love the Blue-Black Mac with bleu cheese, bacon and cracked pepper. I wouldn't want anybody to forget though: they have a full bar. You name it, they'll pour it. Not to mention a regularly update (practically daily) list of local and unusual brews to partake in.

Foodskis and brewskis aside, the ambiance in here is pretty damn sweet. Yeah, I'll admit it's not top-notch, best place you'll ever sit in, mindgasm level. But it works for a bar. Hell the only improvement would be if the place was a bit bigger. Out back they frequently have live bands even on nights when most places in the neighborhood are slowing down and the patio will be pumpin' as the warmer days roll in. And if it's late out and you're drunkenly stumbling in there's their unmistakable ID checker guy out front on a bar stool as usual waiting to draw a happy smiley face on your hand. A night out in NoDa REQUIRES a stop here."}
{"text":"One of our NoDa favorites.  We have been frequenting JackBeagles for around six months.  Excellent food and cheap beer, oftentimes great beers!  The black and blue burger is my go-to.  Very fresh eats and high quality!  A must eat."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's really hard to find a seat let alone a table, It's always busy in the afternoons no matter what day of the week it is. I like the way the restaurant is split into two, you can either eat inside or you can walk past the double doors in the back and you can eat outside (they have about 3 or 4 TVs out there which is a plus). They occasionally have a band playing in the back during the summer. The food itself is 5 stars, they don't have a huge selection but the food they serve is delicious. If you ever get a chance to go there I recommend the Hawaiian Honey wings, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This place is quickly becoming one of my favorite bars! I have only been here 3 times and each time has been fun! They have a great selection of beers, friendly neighborhood vibe and almost always are playing awesome music!! The previous times we have came here we sat at the bar and saw the cooks making mac and cheese non stop.. It looked delicious!! So this time (even though I had just finished dinner at Heist) I had to order a small cup. And it was as yummy as it looked!! Next time we are definitely are coming back here to eat!"}
{"text":"Jack Beagles is probably one of my favorite watering holes in Charlotte. The entire NoDa area reminds me of home in Seattle. It's artsy and laid back with live bands dotted around.

The staff is always super friendly, the atmosphere is relaxed, and I always manage to meet interesting people here. The drinks are strong and the bar food is yummy. I definitely recommend the wings and the mac 'n cheese. They cook up the pasta, then add things in to toss around in a pan, and the final step is they put it into an oven so the cheese on top melts. If you sit at the bar, you're going to have to order it, because it'll be right in front of your face, calling you. 

The funny thing is that everyone seems to have one item they say you have to try. I've heard so many now that I can't keep track. Go with your gut, your hungry growling gut. It can't go wrong here. Plus, the patio in the back is dog friendly and the music is always great."}
{"text":"Sweet eats. Tasty, well-priced drinks. Friendly service. And overall really good time. What else could you want from a neighborhood bar?! 

Yes, JackBeagles is a grand addition to the NoDa bar & food scene with a comfortable space that will appeal to many. The vibe is laid back but fun and the food affordable but tasty. It is absolutely worth a visit whether you're popping in for a hearty Bloody Mary on a Saturday afternoon or hitting up the bar scene for a late night PBR and hot dog. And don't forget to grab yourself some hot, crispy and delicious fries! They're thin wedges and damn delicious. 

I like me some JackBeagles."}
{"text":"There is a menu section devoted to different types of adult mac n cheeses. Do I even need to say anything else? 

Jack Beagles is a super cool neighborhood bar in the heart of NoDa. Low key atmosphere. Friendly staff. Great prices. Killer tunes. Unique beer selection. Nice patio area. They serve food late night and offer a fantastic breakfast menu on the weekends.

The wings are tremendous. Wednesday is half price wing night and $1 off whiskey. If you're with friends... I recommend hot garlic parmesan. Outstanding. Skip these if you're on a date. Well, unless your sidekick also wants them. Then I guess you can follow the rule of the couple who eats garlic together stays together.

Jacks also serves a mean hot dog. Be sure to get jalapeno relish on it. And don't forget an order of fries. Think thin wedges of heavenly potato goodness. You can also get these buried treasure style... loaded with a laundry list of toppings.

This is a must visit place if you are ever in the NoDa area"}
{"text":"Came for the mac and cheese and was a little disappointed. The on tap beer selection is pretty limited, and what else would I drink with mac and cheese?

We split two types of mac between us - the Thai and the pesto. Both were pretty good, but I wish I knew how small the servings were. I actually love that they're more of a snack size because that can be hard to find, but I was expecting it to be dinner. No worries, we ordered some fries to round out our balanced meal.

Overall, I wanted to love JackBeagles more than I did. I live in noda now but I don't know how often I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love that this bar has such great bar food. They never disappoint. One of my favorite places to eat for a low key night in NoDa."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place - from the food to the ambiance to their acceptance of dogs. They have a delicious menu, but the only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because of their terrible service recently. For some reason they have been opening at noon on the weekends, instead of their normal 9am opening time. The staff does not answer the phone or have a voicemail setup that says why they aren't answering and why they aren't opening until noon. I have been trying to eat breakfast here for the past three weeks  and each time we have called ahead to pick up, we have been directed to voicemail or if it was past noon, they say they are no longer serving breakfast (one day we waited THREE HOURS until their noon opening time just to have them tell us breakfast is no longer available - thanks for starving me).

Today, I called three times, no answer. I physically drive to the restaurant and see their handwritten note saying they don't open until noon. I am disappointed that I had to physically see the sign in person to know what is going on. It is frustrating that they are not clear with their customers on their schedule both online (Yelp) and over the phone. 

Jack Beagles staff - please fix this as I've been wanting your breakfast burrito for WEEKS and you guys are preventing me. Thanks."}
{"text":"Once again I really hate a place everyone loves. I can't help it. I went there last night with some friends to get a burger after a show had let out, and we were cold and starving.

Going inside Jack Beagles did not help me out with either of those things.

First it took about 40 minutes to receive our food. Our waitress just sort of stared over at our table wondering what the hell we were still doing there while talking to friends and the bartender. During this 40 minute time period the fans were turned up to such an astronomical speed that in my winter jacket i was freezing to death. We asked our waitress if there was anything to be done and once again she just stared at us like we were the biggest morons to ever grace her presence. We noticed a lot of other patrons becoming really cold too, so it wasn't just me being a baby either. It wasn't until my friend got up and told her we were going to walk out that they finally, oh god, finally turned them off. Oh and then the air conditioning kicked on and blew right onto our table. Thanks guys.

I ordered a burger that was supposed to have cheese, bacon and jalapenos. This burger had so many jalapenos that it was literally just a jalapeno burger. The burger was just this really super weird combination of blandness and burning of my stomach lining. My friend got fries with cheese and gravy. I ate one fry and wanted to die. Not because it was good, but because if that's what passes as gravy these days I no longer wanted to live."}
{"text":"Incredible food for an incredible price. Looks sketchy from the outside but don't let that scare you away- awesome environment and amazing food."}
{"text":"Came here Sunday and the food was great! We just got a few things, two different mac and cheeses, beers and steak dogs! They were delish.  Service was very slow on the patio, specially with us two being partially the only two out there, but was great because I could bring my puppy and she could roam while we ate. I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times since it has opened.  I have to say it is pretty damn good at a nice price.

There are two reasons I gave Jack Beagle's five stars.  

First... good drink specials.  The two times I had gone there they had Dale's Pale Ale for $2.50.  I went there on a Sunday and they had $2 Bloody Marys and Mimosas.  
**EDIT: They raised the price of Bloodys and Mimosas.  They are now 3.50 and 2.50 respectively.  

Second... The best hot dogs in town.  They are smoked hot dogs that can be ordered grilled or fried.  Fried hot dogs do not appeal to me so I went for the grilled.  I ordered one hot dog with chili, slaw, and onions.  The chili they use for the hot dogs is very tasty.  For my second dog I ordered it with a mango chutney and jalapeno relish.  The sweetness of the mango with the spicy of the jalapeno made for a fantastic combination.  Now for the good part... I got two hot dogs and a side of delicious medallion/half-moon shaped fries for about $5 and it is worth it.  

I would like to describe Jack Beagle's as cozy.  Jack Beagles is a small place and does not have a great deal of seating.  I did not get the fastest service but I did not seem to mind.  The server seemed new and by herself so will not be holding it against her or the establishment. 

I also had the wings and cheese-steak.  Both great eats but I would go for the dogs first."}
{"text":"Cozy and laid-back, much like the rest of NoDa. Inside is rather small and gets crowded, but I love the patio! Lots of room, heat lamps during the colder months and live music during the warmer months. 

Food here is wonderful, the waffle fries with gravy are perfect for late night munchies. And their inventive mac n cheeses never disappoint! 

Only downside is that there are only 2 one-room bathrooms, which creates long lines when it's crowded. It's not much worse than a typical bar though, but they're right by the door to the patio so it can get real cramped while you're waiting to go! 

Bathrooms aside, this will continue to be a go-to bar for me as I love the atmosphere, food and the drinks of course!"}
{"text":"Great little artsy hole in the wall. The food is great...especially the Mac and cheese. I've tried them all and my fav is the blue black Mac, but you can't go wrong with any of them. 

My hubby is from Philly and this is the ONLY place in town where he's gotten a cheesesteak comparable to home. 

Service could be a bit better and the beer could be a bit colder. I'd also like to see more craft and local beers on special. Other than that...this is a great place to catch some great bar food and hang with friends."}
{"text":"Love jacks... eat here for breakfast and late night! Everything is made fresh and staff is super chill. Good music in the back on warmer days!"}
{"text":"Great service and interiors. Absolutely delicious beer with the crunchiest mushroom fries. There, I said it!"}
{"text":"Outstanding brunch/breakfast! A lot of food for your money.  I have also had the hotdogs before which were really good too.  Never had bad service. I would definitely go back.  I would definitely recommend trying at least for brunch."}
{"text":"Great food. Cold Brews. Friendly staff. Open late. 

Stugots
Fried Mushrooms
Steak Salad
Blue Burger
Black and Blue Mac

I could eat there 5 days a week."}
{"text":"Okay as a bar and lots of people go here. However the only time I have been it was infested with bar flies!!!  Hopefully this has changed but I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! The staff was really nice and attentive and the chef was super nice also. I ordered the Stugot and I could eat that thing over and over! It was the perfect combination of everything! The fries were great also. They have some kind of seasoning sprinkled on top that just makes them good, but after eating my sandwich, which was huge by the way, I was stuffed. I will definitely be back and I'm sure I'll be bringing a group with me!"}
{"text":"Such an odd state we live in that a place like this has to serve food as well as beverages - because to me, Jables is about drinking, not eating, and that's just fine, and it isn't just because half the menu is the aptly-named Steak section (in a pinch, us tree-huggers can eat apps - fried mushrooms, bruschetta, etc).

A comfy, orange-and-brick space with beers both adventurous and non, a large, well built bar, good service and few TVs. Tuesdays are half price pints, lovely lovely. Low-key personality and it kinda works."}
{"text":"Sat out in the back patio here. I loved the low key vibe of this place and how easy to was to grab a seat. I had a ripper (hot dog) with slaw and spicy mustard, and a cup of the jack Mac. Hot dog was tasty and delivered my meat fix. I was a bit disappointed by the Mac n cheese though. It was more \"liquid-y\" than my preference and clearly had not been baked. It was good and I ate it all, but reviews would have me believe it was the best in town. Definitely not the case.  Service was pleasant but very slow, especially for a quiet night.

If I lived in the area I could see coming by here on a whim for a drink and a bite. But as it stands I do not live nearby, and there wasn't anything in particular that would make it a destination for me so I will likely not be back."}
{"text":"Jackbeagles is great! They have such a diverse menu and the best part is that it's super inexpensive. If you are penny pinching and need a cheap meal this is the place to go. 

The hot dogs are done right. You can decorate them however you want. Lots of Mac and cheese options. It's a great bar with great bar food! Try the cheesy garlic bread as a starter. It is perfectly done."}
{"text":"*** I can't review on the food because I didn't eat ***
But we met some friends there around 8pm on a Saturday night. They were sitting out back and having dinner and drinks. The band started playing about 10 minutes later. Once the band started playing, it was to loud to talk to anyone ( which I get is common with bands but it's wasn't pleasant). Our server dropped off waters and then disappeared.  Lastly, I walk up to the bar to order a cider and the bartender was trying to tell me about the different types of ciders they have but, it was so loud I couldn't hear her.  She gave me the one on draft, it came in a little 12oz plastic cup. Once I got the bill, they charged me $6.50 for that little glass of cider.  So in the end, this place is really loud, has bad service, and the drinks are expensive. I won't return."}
{"text":"Ohhhhhh how I wanted to love Jack Beagles. I'd heard good things from friend and read good things on Yelp. So I had really high hopes and I left feeling somewhat underwhelmed. 

Waitress: our waitress was Rivera and she was friendly and fun. We really liked her. She was attentive and super patient in answering all of my questions. 

Drinks: we had mimosas and both thought they were just ok. 

Food: everything was just ok. Nothing was stellar but nothing was terrible. We had the buried treasure, which was pretty good. I had the buffalo chicken wrap and couldn't taste much of the sauce on it. My boyfriend had the stugot cheese steak and described it as \"pretty good\". We both had macaroni and cheese but were so full we couldn't eat it so it's currently in our fridge. Overall, the food was okay but nothing that I left raving about. 

Service: while we liked our waitress, we were both unimpressed with the time it took for our food to come out. We noticed other tables had quite a long wait for their food as well. Our entire visit took over an hour and a half, which was crazy. 

Will I rush back to this place? Nope. But will I object if a friend wants to go here for dinner? Nah."}
{"text":"we needed a late night drunk meal and ended up here. the burger was okay but nothing special.. the burger came with a HUGE pickle :]"}
{"text":"i love the bartenders. i usually come here for a $3 pbr and you can't go wrong with a side of classic mac and the seasoned waffle fries are really good too"}
{"text":"First time visiting jackbeagles will definitely come back. 

Got the shit on a shingle breakfast ( no really, it's called that) chopped steak and gravy on Texas toast. Soooo yummy. 

The iced coffee is good too. They have coconut and hazelnut flavor. 

Only reason for 3 stars is that it was 1125 and I wanted lunch but only breakfast served for that time being. Not bad though. Will be back! 

No pics! I forgot!"}
{"text":"Very cool and affordable place. I ordered the hummus with pita bread. I liked the hummus but the pita bread was fought. I ordered more bread extra crispy and it still was doughy. My meal was the blue bayou and it was DELICIOUS! I highly recommend it! It doesn't come with a side so you have to pay extra for the waffle fries. So only three stars for the up charge and soft-doughy pita bread. Sunday's have $5 double mimosa ans"}
{"text":"What a cool spot in NoDa!!  We ate at the bar cause the place was packed out on a Saturday night.  The chef was in rare form and was very entertaining (the kitchen is sort of behind the bar). They turn out some great food from a tiny little kitchen.  

They had Coco Loco from NoDa Brewing in bottles. yum!  I ordered the cheesesteak and fries.  This was in the top 3 best cheesesteaks I have ever eaten.  The steak especially had excellent flavor.  Peppers and onions were cooked well.  Cheese was correctly portioned so as not to overpower the steak.  Bread was fresh.  Fries were good.

We overheard the staff talking about the live music that was about to start so we moved outside to the patio and grabbed a table. Soon enough the acoustic goodness started.  The outside area was packed as well and so loud that we couldn't hear very well but it was a very nice outside area with additional bar and lots of seating.

I wish this place was in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"There aren't enough great things to say about this place. In lieu of tine and space, ill list a few necessities: 

Ask for Henry - he'll make sure you get a great pour
Order the macncheese - even if your entry is a salad
Come by on Tuesday and play free Bingo and win bar bucks
Go on Wednesdays for 1/2 off wings - Hot Garlic Parm are AMAZING!!
Order any food item - you will LOVE IT!!
Bring your dog and enjoy the patio
Tip well - the folks here work hard to make sure you enjoy your stay!"}
{"text":"JB located in the NoDa area is the dive bar of all dive bars. Great bartenders very down to earth & makes great drinks. JB based on some of the locals I've spoken to live by their Mac & Cheese  which comes in different flavors, my fav is the classic which is awesome to say the least. I have to admit that there is A & C squad. From my experience the later it gets the food quality changes. I've come around 12pm on Friday vs 1:30am on a Saturday and ordered the same thing with different results. 

Anyway with all that being said its still an awesome spot and they have events and live music out on the patio. Great group of people and diversity with varying music so a little something for everyone. 

I recommend the Mac and try the wings which are great. The hotdogs and chili are also a fav of  mine. JB also steams their drink glasses which was new for me. Coming from NY, that's not something I've seen in high end bars."}
{"text":"The spot for Mac and Cheese north of center city. Because who doesn't love Mac and Cheese?!? Jackbeagles is a staple of the NoDa community. Tons of food choices including a brunch menu on the weekends. Cheap beer and shots specials. And a solid chance you will catch some live music too. They have outdoor seating available year round and a second bar outside by the stage. 

They don't have a huge area inside so during typical dinner hours there might a short wait to get a table. The folks who work in the kitchen really know what they are doing whether it's a fried hot dog, a huge burger, sandwiches or their famous Mac and Cheese.

Overall expect a solid calm neighborhood feel from this place. They have great specials throughout the week including 50 cent wings and a great invention called the Macarrito. Also plenty of local brews on tap. So go on our and enjoy yourself :)"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite place for delicious ole' pub food! From the Mac N Cheese to the fried mushrooms, you can't go wrong. This is where my lover and I first feel in love!"}
{"text":"NODA is on the come up so when a friend suggested dinner there- I said why not! We walked in and it was very intimate but my first thought was this is a def a dive bar. They had a great beer selection but I'm not a beer girl. I drink cider which I know I know is not really beer but it's the closest I can do. But with $1 off whiskey and a good cider the place had me. I had the Classic Beagle medium well and asked for caramelized instead of raw onion. They were happy to oblige. The burger was delicious, it wasn't overlooked, and was quite juicy. The waffle fries were seasoned and quite tasty. Craving a good burger or some hearty food and this is your place. The drinks are good. The music is solid. The staff is very welcoming and the service was great."}
{"text":"Delicous mac n cheese! Food was priced great for the portions you are getting, and they had a great variety with a twist on normal meal items (example, mexi mac n cheese was amazing). Service was great. Live band was awesome to listen to. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The French toast was the popular order of our group. The double mimosas were a double surprise and strong so half the group liked it and the other half couldn't hang. The cheese grits were not what I was expecting because it wasn't mixed in, but the worst part is that it was melted on the top and wouldn't mix in with the grits. So I had grits with chunky cheese which didn't taste right. The Classic Beagle was out of this world. Outside of that the rustic warm artistic feel and Irish coffee makes it worth while."}
{"text":"A great spot for lunch or late night munchies!

Classic mac is some of the best mac and cheese you'll find!"}
{"text":"So, I was looking forward to returning to Jack Beagle.  I told my husband how good the Turf and Turf Burger was and how that they will give you a portabello mushroom cap on the bun without the beef and bacon.  Well, he ordered it that way and ended up with three mushroom slices on a bun.  He was still hungry after he ate  it and ordered the blue Mac and cheese.  When I ordered the portabello burger with no meat, it came with a side, those delightful waffle fries.  My husband was shorted.
However, I ordered the steak salad.  They had a vegetarian option that substituted portabello mushroom slices for steak.  I also subbed the garlic ranch dressing for the balsamic vinagrette.  With those fried onions and blue cheese crumbles, that had to be one of the best salads I ever had.  I have a feeling though that one portabello cap was shared between my salad and my husband's sandwich.
So, if someone orders the portabello cap with no meat, please give them them the whole cap as the menu clearly states.  They want to have a satisfying meal, too.  Vegetarians don't live on air, and they don't like to be cheated.  
Otherwise, our server was very nice.  And, if my salad wasn't so good,  the rating would have been lower."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Been here twice and twice impressed! A nice little restaurant in the heart of NoDa, with personable employees, great prices, and fast service! 

Their Blue Bayou burger is perfection! Beef patty with bacon and blue cheese crumbles with really amazing sauce! Couldn't have asked for a better juicy and favorful burger! One of the best I've had! 

Their salads are delicious too! I had the BBQ salad, and it was amazing!! The BBQ pulled pork was tenderly cooked and the sauce was absolutely delicious!

If you are fan of mac-n-cheese, they have a selection of adult mac-n-cheeses! You will not be disappointed! 

Definitely a must check out restaurant!"}
{"text":"I don't find myself in NoDa enough these days, and after a show at the neighborhood I wasn't going to let the chance to go out slip on by. enter jack beagles... and imagine that, it was whiskey wednesday. 

i clearly fell in love immediately. but the jukebox, the megatouch, the lovely bar space, the option for (good) food, the friendly bartender, the cheap drinks, and the clean bathroom sealed the deal for me. I was actually surprised how many people came in to primarily eat, and then maybe drink. 

great low-key neighborhood feel, I see myself returning to JB fairly soon, most likely in the middle of the week."}
{"text":"Great food, cheap price, great service. What more could you ask for? We stumbled upon this gem Friday night and despite a decent sized crowd, service was quick.

This place features greasy diner food, Northeast style. My friend and I had the rippers, deep fried hotdogs, and they were great, although I am sure that was my recommended calorie intake for the week. 

We both had 2 rippers, fries (which were like really really thick potato chips and delicious), a beer each, and walked out with a $15.50 bill. With so many new restaurants charging more, it is nice to see this spot solidifying itself as the neighborhood hole in the wall.

There was no visible sign out front that I saw. I had to ask the waiter what the name of the place was, hopefully they will work on better branding with their menus/signs in the future. Also, the door guy has no personality and even though I went to the place twice in 1 night, he had no short term memory and kept IDing me. Otherwise, great experience, will definately be heading back in the future (after 5000 sit-ups to cancel out the first visit!)"}
{"text":"JackBeagles is inexpensive. They are cheap but so good! Walk right in and seat yourselves... that is, if you can find a spot.

They have a good beer menu that is pretty extensive... any beer drinker can find something that they would like. I think that the prices are fair and comparable for NoDa.

I came here on a night out with the boyfriend. Try all of the mac and cheeses.... they are so good. I also ordered a burger that I cannot remember. It was average. 

There was music playing in the background and a great overall vibe. Service was just decent but I know she was hustling. I would definitely recommend this spot while at a night out in NoDa- who doesn't love cheap food, good beer, and a great atmosphere?"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very chill and unpretentious, which is nice when you're not in the mood for a night uptown. Great service and above average pub food. Try the mac and cheese..any of them."}
{"text":"I think I'm a regular now. The food is delish and the atmosphere is great. Such a great hangout spot."}
{"text":"Food was extremely good & inexpensive.. only to hung I hated was, my food all came out separately.. like 15-20 min in between each entree"}
{"text":"You want a nice, belly up, NO DA bar?  This is a good choice.  We wandering in during a cold snap and were greeted cheerfully by a saucy bartender.   She gave us some good talk on the specials and had us sold.      

They had a couple beers on tap that I hadn't tried yet and it being Wednesday we lucked into their wings special.

If you like a hot-bqq ( like a sweat and hot) wing, then get the \"Barbalo\" sauce. It was good. It left zinging taste in my mouth, but not to hot or vinegary for the lips."}
{"text":"well-- JB's used to be my favorite-- but then they changed their fries!!! it truly was the worst decision they could have made! their \"beagle fries\" were the best things ever-- that's what kept my friends and i coming back.. now it's just plain old waffle fries with some scarce seasoning on them. blah.

BRING BACK THE BEAGLE FRIES!!!"}
{"text":"Came for breakfast. The breakfast tacos with hollandaise are awesome!"}
{"text":"Sunday mornings are better at Jack Beagle's. I normally get their SOS with a bloody Mary. If you're not there for brunch, I think their blue bayou burger is the best burger in town. Get it with blue-black mac or jack-mac."}
{"text":"What is it about NoDa that springs to life such great places as Crepe Cellar, Revolution Pizza, Solstice, and now Jack Beagle's.  Is it the water?  Is there something in the air (no, not THAT something)?  Whatever it might be it's responsible for another great place in a great neighborhood.

I've been to Jack Beagle's twice now, both evening visits, and it was a great experience on each occasion.  Their beer list is distinct, and apparently ever evolving as the list on the menu was the same both times but what was on tap didn't necessarily match up, including beers like Abita Select (a vanilla porter) that I haven't seen anywhere else around town.  Along with the snooty stuff I like they keep a selection of the yellow fizzy stuff around to keep that crowd happy as well.

The menu...it's interesting, in a cool awesome way.  Great hot dogs are available any number of ways, including deep fried (not battered like a corn dog, just to dog boiled in oil basically).  And the potato wedge-fry things are the side to get.  Great tasting and they do get at soaking up the extra alcohol from the previously mentioned beer selection.

Head to NoDa and give Jack Beagle's a try, totally worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Great food during the day and staff is prompt and friendly for a bar. Night time gets much more busy but service has still been great. The live music is always awesome and their outside venue is awesome with beautiful weather.   Great place, relaxed atmosphere. 

Doorman at night is super nice and cool."}
{"text":"Though I frequent the NoDa neighborhood a few times per month, this was my first time visiting JackBeagles. My friends and I came here after the Parkway Drive concert at the Fillmore. We were famished after all the moshing and head banging and needed food in our belly to soak up the overpriced alcohol and sober up a bit before heading back home (don't worry, we had a DD).

Each of my friends ordered the Philly cheesesteak. One even ordered it with cheese whiz (ugh... just... no). I, however, strayed from the pack and ordered a basket of fried mushrooms and a cup of chili mac. The fried mushrooms were thinly sliced portabellas, lightly breaded, and fried golden. While it was good, I'm not sure I would order it again. The chili mac was made with your typical elbow macaroni and cheddar cheese, but what elevated the dish was the savory, sweet, and slightly spicy chili. 

There were no complaints from anyone in our group. We left with our bellies full and smiles on our faces.

I love the divey atmosphere of this little restaurant. The staff was very amiable, especially our server, Ryan. My opinion of this place may be skewed even more favorably since Ryan comped half my meal without me knowing. JackBeagles was a great ending to our amazing night. There's simply no wrong choice with anything on the menu so give this place a visit if you're in the NoDa area."}
{"text":"We came here after work one day and wasn't too impressed with what we found. We sat at the bar hoping we could get a couple of drinks in. Wednesday's was $1 off whiskey and half off wings, deals we thought would be pretty good. I ordered a fireball  just to gauge prices, and including the discount it was $5...eh not that great since I get $3 fireballs from on the border...

The bar tender took forever to notice us..I literally had to stare her down to get her to come over. She was nice, just not attentive. We ordered a bowl of jack mac, they have 4 different kinds of mac and cheese options with some twists. I can't help myself when it comes to mac so I had to order a bowl to split with the bf. In light of the half of wing wednesdays we ordered a 10pc with hot garlic parm and the spicy mango habanero equivalent. 

Didn't take long to come out, that was probably the biggest plus of our meal. The mac and cheese bowl looked like the cup size...seriously tiny and not worth the $6...it had good flavor not amazing and no texture...I wouldn't call this adult mac and cheese. Maybe I just spoil myself with the mac I make at home with all the fixins thrown in. The wings, celery sticks and carrots were sad, soggy and lukewarm...I am 99% sure they were frozen though the website seems to claim otherwise. The flavor of the sauces was good though the mango habanero was NOT SPICY at all...I just wished the quality of the wings and sides were just as good...BWW does wings way better in my opinion..

In addition, the wings were not really half off...they docked on extra 2 dollars because we ordered two different sauces...which is lame. We had an ok experience but I doubt we will be coming back for after work munchies.."}
{"text":"Jack beagles is my go to in Noda. The have something to please everyone day or night. 
Typical bar food options that are good and affordable! Brunch is pretty solid as well!

Jack Beagles has a great dive feeling, more of a bar style than full on restaurant in the evening, however I have also been here for brunch and the food is swell! 

Best Tip about this place: bring your doggie!!"}
{"text":"A hole in the wall with crazy good mac and cheese.

It looks like a dive bar, it smells like a dive bar, the bathrooms are a dive bar's, the service is a dive bars... the food is incredible! Best drunk food I have ever had. I need to try all the mac and cheeses."}
{"text":"The food here is tasty, I could smell it from a block away, I believe I had the Garlic & Parmesan Hot Wings and fries, which where one of the best wings I've ever had, there's also a fairly big patio out back where you can eat and have you a smoke. The waitress was super friendly and very helpful with my order, being it was my first time there, the only downside is the one bathroom for the ladies and one for the men, so if you gotta go, I suggest u not try to hold it and hope there's not a line, but all in all the food and atmosphere here is great, and I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"waffle fries and chicken fingers. what else could you ever need? oh, booze. tons of booze. this place is my favorite spot in NODA"}

{"text":"A fun local NoDa joint with 6 tables and a bar, serving hand smoked rib wraps with blue cheese coleslaw and a great beer list. The service was great, and friendly (\"Hi we're Erin and Laura and we'll be taking care of you.\") and the decore fun ( local art). I was here for lunch, but I'll bet it's filled at night."}
{"text":"Our first stop for grub in Charlotte and let me tell you this place did not disappoint! Our valet at the hotel told us to check this out and I can't thank him enough!
I love it when the server is a fan! You can tell right away if they like working there and more importantly eating there. I often ask...what's your favorite thing here and when they know right off the bat and their giddy about it that is a good sign! Mel was a fan! 

We started with waffle cheese fries - loaded with chili, cheese and peppers! Oh dear Lord! Then we went on two orders of Mac n Cheese - they have such a selection! We asked Mel and she said the Blue Cheese with Bacon and the one with garlic so we listened and so glad we did! Damn they were both good! The blue with bacon was the best though! Then...yes we continued...boneless wings with the sauce that had both BBQ and wing sauce combined. Can't remember the name but ask Mel! 

Oh and I almost forgot. I got a blueberry beer that wS on tap...still looking for something similar! So refreshing and light! The hubs went for a local beer \"Birdsong Brewing Company\" brown ale. 

Just go...the end! Oh and ask for Mel!!!"}

{"text":"Went for breakfast. I had high hopes based on a friends recommendation BUT Like most breakfast spots in CLT this place is average at best. Sat at the bar. Service wasn't great even though they weren't that busy. Gf had the basic breakfast and I ordered the burrito. I just don't understand why there isn't a decent breakfast to be had in CLT. A bad breakfast in Asheville is better that most in CLT."}
{"text":"Get the jack Mac, very good. Went for lunch. (Get the bowl if you're hungry.)

Definitely go back."}
{"text":"Had my first litte rendezvous with JackBeagles yesterday, and my, my, my was I impressed.

I found myself at JackBeagles in the company of a certain spectacular photographer ;) and the kind owner of this flavorful establishment. Inside, JB's offers cute and cozy bar setting with additional setting in house and out on the patio.

The patio offers a friendly escape from your typical dining environment, and a pretty sweet view! I Likey =) Encompassed by a few tall trees and tiki torches there's just enough light, just enough ambient sound, and the right combination of company that made for an almost vacational dining experience. The patio gives guests the perfect combination of feeling included in the restaurant atmosphere and simultaneously offers seclusion from it, an interesting combination and so amazing!

On to the eats! By recommendation I tried one of the delicious hot-dogs. My toppings of choice.. Cheese Of Course! (And ketchup, and mustard) Let me tell you that my hot dog was so delicious and juicy, it was like Nicolas Cage ... Gone in 60 seconds! And the fries, oh the FRIES! In a word..\" mmmmmm\". Yup that's right, \"mmmmmm.\" No word's necessary, just my delicious and satisfied sound. These fries are the perfect combination of real potato crisp and salt. The fries were soo good I could eat them without ketchup! Gasp! 

I look forward to my next visit at JackBeagles. I'll definitely be back to taste a few spirits, and take a bite out of one of JackBeagles fried hot dogs. Mmmm! That is all for now, keep up the great work JackBeagles!"}
{"text":"After spending two nights in downtown Charlotte, we decided to see what this NoDa thing and JackBeagles were all about before we headed back to Raleigh.  (thanks to Yelp for letting us know about both). I will say that getting to NoDa was interesting, as our GPS led us first to a street that was totally closed off, then to one that made us wait for the longest slowest-moving train on the planet.  But it was all just a plot to make sure we didn't have to wait more than 3 minutes for JackBeagles to open at precisely 11:30 on a Monday morning.

We weren't the only ones waiting, and within minutes of opening, 4 or 5 tables were full.  Server handled it all well.  Drinks came out fast.  Sadly, we were hitting the road, so we didn't partake in brew offerings.  Love that they have cup sizes of the different Mac n Cheeses, enabling me to try a couple of them...Jack Mac and Mexi Mac at just $2.99 each!  Husband did the Reading Street Steak Sandwich, which  involved mushrooms and tomato.  

Note:  this isn't already-prepared Mac 'n Cheese...you can see them make it to order!  Both of mine were rich and delicious in an under-stated way.  I enjoy a cheesy Mac n Cheese, as compared to a baked kind, and that is what they deliver.  For the Jack Mac, think cheese with a Frank's Red Hot kinda subtle undertone.  Mexi-Mac had some green chiles of some type in a subtle way as well.  Liked them both equally well, and thanks to their richness, got to enjoy them again the next day.

Meanwhile Husband was liking his sandwich and fries. Although he did say he thought it could have used more seasoning.  No leftovers for him though, that's for sure.

Price-wise...very reasonable!

TIP:  Check-out the cute pic on the restroom door!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place that was open after 11pm. This place looks good as I came in and the pics looked good. The waitress was really nice young girl. The happy hour drinks are. 5$ for Red Bull and vodka. It was good and the fried hot dog  was good but they gave my sliced cheap kraft cheese and the hot dog and the hot dog was burnt. 
I ordered the cheese Parmesan with there special
Sauce it was horrible I sent it back I Literally almost threw up.
Be cautious"}
{"text":"Wings and mac and cheese. Done!  - That should be enough to get you through the door, right? 

If you're confused as to where this NoDa gem is located... look for Cabo and it's on the opposite end of the same block. As expected, parking is at your own risks, so find somewhere and walk on over to join the crowd. The food will put an end to any complaints in the event you're just a passenger. 

At first glance, the place seems small and you're probably looking around to see where you can wait for an open table. The hidden treasure is the back patio with a second full bar. The patio has more TVs and larger tables for larger groups, but you may need a coat once the temperature drops. 

Luckily, a few chairs opened up at the first bar so my friends and I were able to grab a spot and quickly order our drinks. There were a few specials available, so be sure to check the (lighted) list to the left of the bar before placing an order. We were informed that the kitchen was running behind, so our food would take a little longer than normal. I always appreciate a heads up before making my food order, if the kitchen is running behind, so the bartender was already turning into my best friend. 

After ordering a dozen wings I was pleased to see that they weren't tiny wings that some pubs like to offer and if I must say... give the Cajun and Jack's Hot Garlic Parmesan a try, thank me later. The only setback was the fact that I smelled like I'd been cooking the food myself, as sitting at the bar resulted in my jacket smelling like french fries upon my departure. However, that's not enough to keep me from this place. 

Hope you take part in all the mac and cheese options they have to offer!!"}
{"text":"Yes it's a bar and yes it's surrounded by other bars, but it is by far my favorite drinking hole.  Almost every night is started here because of the friendly bartenders and the well priced drinks and beer. 

But the most shocking factor of JackBeagles is there phenomenal food offering. They're hot dogs and macaroni and cheese cannot be compared to any other in the Noda area. And because they serve breakfast, it's a great place to roll out of bed for on Sunday mornings."}
{"text":"Cool place to hang out on a day off...!  Great hot dogs and the beer line-up was very tempting. Next time...

Fries were ok but the mac & cheese was spectacular. Next time I'll skip the fries.  Not many vegetarian options - even the mac & cheese had bacon. 

The patio out back is great for big groups of friends and it has a stage for bands. 

Thanks, Yelp, for finding this great place!"}
