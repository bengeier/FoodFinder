{"text":"Interesting concept! The owners/chef pick a different animal every week and create a tasting menu around it.  It's definitely not for the faint of heart and you need to be a raging carnivore to want to eat here.  This resto is only open until late November in the space occupied by Orbit Room.  One of the owners told us that they are looking at opening a permanent location but haven't decided on where just yet.  

We went in August during pig week.  Our dishes included fried pig's ear, blood sausage, roasted pig's cheek on crispy fried bread and a donut with candied bacon and red bean puree.  The stand out dishes were definitely the pig's cheek and the desert.

Nice touch having the bill come in a spent Winchester bullet casing. Also loved the \"menu\" which was a drawing of a pig with various body parts numbered to show what would be used in each course.

Service was fantastic.  We ordered sparkling water and Perrier was brought to the table.  When we ordered a second bottle there was a bit of a delay and San Pellegrino appeared.  The waitress apologized for the different brand and admitted they didn't usually carry sparkling water so they had someone running over to the convenience store to pick it up.  It's little things like that which can really push a restaurant from good to great in my opinion.  

Will be heading back again before they close in November.  Just checking the website for what meat they're scheduling for the next month or two."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of trying some of the food at beerfest a few years ago and have been meaning to try one of their 5-6 snout-to-tail course meals. I am soo sad that I missed the boat and they're closed. I really do hope that Chef Noah Goldberg does end up opening an establishment in the city in the near future because there's not enough places like this in the city!"}

Allez cuisine!

If you have ever been to Orbit room, it's weird that this divey-music venue is a part-time pop-up restaurant.

It's a $65 set dinner with 6 courses.  The wine pairing for $35 dollars a great deal and you can sample an array of vino.  The Riesling was definitely standout being slightly syrupy.

The servers are spectacular and with a creative menu and format, this dinner was a great night out!

The appetizers or snacks were the shock factor ones.  But to be honest, with a bunch of Asians at the table, you have to do a lot more than maple duck feet for a shock!  They were tasty though.  The deep fried gizzards with dipping sauce were fun finger foods to munch on.  

The duck tongue was served like buffalo wings.  Deep fried battered and piping hot, served with celery and carrots with blue cheese dressing.  The tongue was tender and juicy and one of the favourite items at the table.

The seared duck breast was delicious and perfectly cooked, even if it's not as unique of a dish, still filling and tasty.

The dessert was interesting.  A meringue with some foie, and a light tasting slightly sweet mousse served in a duck egg shell.  The greasy and savoury foie worked with the crispy and sweet meringue.

Overall, we had a wonderful evening here.  The creativity and care put into preparing our meal exceeded our expectations.  Yay, feasting room! I hope that they find a permanent home in Toronto."}
{"text":"Love the concept!  I had the pleasure of being invited by fellow yelper Yvonne to hit this whole animal 6 course tasting menu.

On this night we got the pleasure of being Goosed.. ummm... though... uhh.. not quite literally... or wait...  maybe literally and not figuratively... err.. We ate Goose.

6 very good, albeit mini tapas sized dishes plus a deep fried gizzard starter and a Corn with shredded wing soup.

I enjoy breast, and the goose was pretty darn good too.  It's super hard to not get crazy fatty greasy goose, but I'd say this was done fairly well.

Well only thought about all the dishes was that the goose itself didn't seem to have a lot of goose flavour.  The sauces were great, the dishes were seasoned well, but I wouldn't have walked away going \"hey great Goose\" (or great Cesar's Ghost).

Our server was probably one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of being served by.  Aside from being informative (or admitting to not knowing and going to find out) most importantly she laughed at my humor, or at least faked it really really well.  

Overall a great experience, but it'd be tough to shell out $103 for a meal (including a a glass of wine + tax and tip) on a regular basis. 

However, if you're looking for something in this category, I highly recommend you get goosed.. umm.. yeah."}

I kidnapped Tony F. en tow to check out the Feasting Room with me.  The concept is simple:  a different animal every week, and they try to cook the whole beast.  Snout to tail, or in our case beak to tail?  

This week's animal sacrifice was goose.  As Tony F. noted, the \"goose\" flavour was a bit toned down (I guess they're trying to cater to the masses and perhaps gamey-ness is not so appealing).  

While the garnishes and dishes were all very well thought-out, and nicely presented, the technique or know-how lacked on a few of them (namely the rubbery and flavourless duck gizzards and the breast that took more than a few chews to get down).  

My favourite dish was definitely the Goose \"Sausage\" which is leg meat stuffed into the neck.  Very creative!

The cheeky dessert was a \"Goose\"berry Rice Pudding served with smoked stone fruits (apricot and peach) with a goose-fat Madeleine.

The Riesling they had was absolutely amazing, but I'm sad to say that they bought the entire 2009 stock from the winery and it's quite the special lot as the way the crop ripened was abnormal (in a good way) and so it's much closer to an ice wine and hence a lot sweeter.  

Our server, as Tony F. mentioned was one of the best I've had in Toronto.  Servers like her renew my faith that Toronto's restaurant industry is not purely made up of inexperienced university kids looking to make enough money to buy the newest iPhone.

Overall, a great experience.  Loved the enclosed rooftop patio."}
{"text":"SURPRISE!
So what's for dinner? You aren't given the exact details! All you know is the date, the time, and the location!

At the Feasting Room, they celebrate eating the whole animal. That's right; that means eating ALL of the animal parts. Each week they create a new blind-tasting menu that focuses on one animal. It's a 6 course meal, with a few appetizers thrown in at the beginning as teasers. The animal featured for the night is not yet revealed until you get to your table.

You love surprises, and don't mind playing the guessing game! What will it be tonight? Will it be Pig? Duck? Goose? ...  And how adventurous are you when it comes to eating food?  What parts will be served? Dare you eat it?

MYSTERY
Once you arrive at the address, the venue is a bit tricky to find. It is almost fitting that the location is not apparent, which adds to the mystery of the event!

You look UP and around for a signage, but see no evident signs overhead. Then, on the ground, THERE IT IS, The Feasting Room signage standing on the ground. You are relieved to find it.

You swing open the tall slim door and a little taken aback by what you see. It's a surprisingly dark staircase, long and narrow, and encompassed by glittery white mosaic walls, with an inviting red glow, softly shimmering at the top of the climb. This immediately feels like a \"secret location\".

Once upstairs, the space opens up and you find yourself in a quaint rockstar style bar, with black flooring, walls and ceiling. At the far back corner is a stage with musical instruments set up. The space is simple, yet hipster and grunge glam. And you like it!


IT'S TIME!
Then, the moment you've been waiting for has finally come! It's feasting time! You can no longer handle the mystic and excitedly grab the menu to see what the featured animal is for the night! Just to prolong the suspense a tad bit longer, the menu is wrapped beautifully with recycled material, stamped with The Feasting Room crest, the entire package tied together elegantly with a thin white thread.

What's inside? It's not a menu! There are NO words. Just a diagram of an animal, and some numbers in bold red!

Clever! More secrets! You love it! You love that you are given the sequence of dishes to come, yet the actual menu and ingredients are still unknown. You are ready and eagerly anticipating the delectable surprises!

The feasting begins sharply at 7:00pm, and for the next 3 hours, the chef and the waitstaff take their time in presenting the beautifully arranged culinary masterpieces, explaining each dish as they arrive at your table . . .

Once you taste this dish, you are speechless. In fact, no one spoke. After the last bite, you look around to see everyone around you with full smiles on! And the guest next to me, Jessica, said it perfectly: \"I could have 6 more of that!\". Then one by one, you could here people shouting, \"That was my FAVOURITE dish!\"."}
{"text":"I attended the Favourites menu for the final week of the Feasting Room at the Orbit Room.  This was my first time eating there and I was very disappointed by the food.  I was hoping that with the menu being the \"Favourites\" menu it would be the greatest items off their different animal menus.  If these were the best items they need to do alot of work before opening up as a new venture.

Way too many good restos in toronto to spend $65 on bad food."}
