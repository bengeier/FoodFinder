{"text":"Great bar where you always feel welcome!  Basic bar food, good drinks, great prices, and nice staff.  One of my favorite bars in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Ooh Goodtimes I heart you.  Thank you for making a Thursday night so amazing.  After the neighbor friends announced their engagement the first words delivered in our group \"let's go celebrate and take a shot at Yesteryears\"  yup thats what we did and once again received incredible service.  The owner Steve is the nicest guy around he gave us a bottle of Champagne to help us celebrate and this isn't the first time he has been so generous during our many celebrations at this bar.  

I am hearing some rumors that they are going to be tearing down this strip mall....please save Yesteryears.  

PS. if your looking for some late night food on New Years Eve the last couple of years they have set-up a breakfast buffet...keep it in mind in case you are passing by."}
{"text":"Karaoke at Yesteryears is a Charlotte institution. The crowd can be thin at times, but when it's on, it's awesome. Plus, you'll never meet a stranger when you're their. It's a shame they'll be closing."}
