{"text":"Ordered takeout from here. The Korean fried chicken was crispy, but not bone-in as expected. They used nuggets instead which weren't as flavourful and refused to provide sauce with takeout. Soba noodles were substituted with rice noodles without mention--this defeats the whole point of the \"soba noodle\" dish. This is really poor service, especially on a takeout order, since the customer would not realize the substitution until s/he gets home and so is not in a position to ask for an exchange or refund.  This is too bad, since I first came here in July and really liked the food. Things seem to have gone downhill. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I think I first came here around 12AM (yay to them for staying open pretty late) during the fall exam season, and was desperately craving some motivational/ comfort food. I came with a group of friends and we settled on several orders of fried chicken.  Initially, I was a bit disappointed because I expecting something different (the Korean fried chicken I had at a restaurant back home was made differently) (do you know that feeling when youre super eager for something, and it's not what you're expecting?) but i still tried it (obviously) , and it was still tasty! It was a little overfried in my opinion, but it might also be because I'm used to a different type of Korean fried chicken   I've come back here several times, and I've tried their tteoboki (spicy rice cake) as well, which was very tasty! I think one of their advantages over other korean fried chicken places is that they have several alternatives  if you're not craving fried chicken ! They also have a variety of alcoholic options (I've only tried the yogurt soju though, which I really enjoyed - it's sweet and the soju flavour isn't very strong)   The staff is pretty friendly too :)"}
{"text":"I walked into this Korean and Japanese fusion establishment based on a recommendation from a fellow yelper and was greeted with a very friendly server.  I decided to go with a few friends so that we could have the opportunity to try more dishes. We ordered a tofu beef soup, large sweet and sour fried chicken, small garlic fried chicken and rice rolls in spicy kimchi sauce.   The food tasted homemade and I have to say I enjoyed it. However it was a little pricier than other Korean restos I have been to. One of my friends also noticed that his large plate of fried chicken was not double the size of the small portion even though it was double the price.   The service was impeccable and this is why I give this 5 stars. I mean our server was always available, she was very personable and always had a smile on her face. It's unfortunate that this service does not happen more often in Montreal restaurants.   I forgot to mention this place is open till 2am or 3am. Needless to say I will be back here. Great job!"}
