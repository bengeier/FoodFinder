{"text":"Amazing food and the owners are both great people. I had a delicious salad, and my fiance had a stuffed pepper concoction that had great beans. Definitely the best beans I've tasted in ages. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Nutritious and wholesome food that actually tastes YUMMY! From the very first bite you can tell these people really care and know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"Found this little gem after searching for gluten free options in the area. I don't know what we loved more, the food (amazing) or the adorable kid who was our server. If you want a spot off the beaten path and love to support \"mom & pop\" shops, this is the place to for you!"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal! Love the fact that Fountain Hills has a healthy option.  I am vegetarian and so excited to see DeNu open.  The owners are wonderful and very accommodating.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"This is a huge find in Fountain Hills.  The food is fresh, healthy and fabulous.  The owners are amazing, friendly and eager to assist in your dining choices.  Everything is wonderful!  Let's support this restaurant because our town has needed something like this for so long.  They also do catering.  Love the soups, salads and just everything about it.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"}
{"text":"Just finishing eating.  I had the arugula salad with salmon.  It was ok, but the size was more of a side salad than an entree salad, so very over priced for what you get. My husband got the sun dried pizzadilla.  He said it was good, it was full of cheese and sun dried tomatoes. personally wouldn't have to come back, but he may."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and had one of the best healthiest lunch's ever. I highly recommend you try it and you must save room for the Whole Young coconut for dessert."}
{"text":"Holy healthy foodie heaven! My fiance's parents ordered lunch to-go from DeNu, it was super fresh and the flavors were unique. My fiance and I split the lemon pesto chicken wrap and the curry wrap because we each couldn't decide which one to get. Both were PHENOMENAL! I also tried the vegetable pho and it was very tasty as well. If you're in the area and looking for a fresh and healthy lunch spot, DeNu is your place! We will most definitely be back again soon to try more dishes (I wish it was closer to home!)! They also have a variety of teas and delicious drinks as well. The best part, you can eat a lot but still feel great afterwards!"}
{"text":"This place is a real treat.  It's owned and run by a family concocting wonderful fuel for your body and soul."}
{"text":"The spinach quesadillas are out of this world my kids loved them.  The bowls and wraps are great.  I actually felt great and surprisingly full from there're food good luck Anon hope your in the hills forever the only place to eat healthy."}
{"text":"The food I ordered was really good, I had a Spinach Salad and Some Quinoa Stuffed Peppers. Pretty cool owners too. Its a really tough location in that spot so I really hope everyone gives it a try. Menu was small but they are planning to expand it. I would advise to please post the hours of operation and \"stick to it\". As a fellow restauranteur I would say don't give up and stay strong. -Ant"}
{"text":"Dénü café is delicious. The owners are extremely down to earth and really care about the food that they make. Stop by here to eat!"}
{"text":"great healthy option in Fountain Hills.  Owner said he makes 90% of all menu items from scratch."}
{"text":"Super yummy food! Leave feeling happy and healthy not gross and full of regret.  Pleasant atmosphere, kind staff, great place to eat."}
{"text":"My daughter and I had lunch there yesterday. It was a perfect day to sit outside under the shade and enjoy our lunch. My daughter ordered the burrito wrap and I ordered the chicken pesto wrap. She had the Hibiscus iced tea and I had the Green Jasmine tea. 

Because my daughter is Vegan and has some food allergies the chef came out to inquire and make certain that she was getting the order correct (that was so appreciated). The food came out and we couldn't have been happier! It was DEE-licious! Everything was fresh and tasted so good! The tea's were also wonderful. We will be back and I can't give more than a 5 -star rating...but if I could, I would! Outstanding place!"}
{"text":"Looking for something healthy and tasty? This is your place! Finally! Fountain Hills has a restaurant owned by people who understand health and are able to cook in a way that is flavorful. It's about time a restaurant was opened that catered to the healthy people out there. Fountain Hills is full of pizza places, Italian food, Mexican food, and Asian food...and like hardly any of it is good. 

I had the Yogi bowl which is served with a delicious side salad. The yogi bowl features sautéed vegetables in a delicious sesame ginger sauce on top of a bed of brown rice. Everything is gluten free and mostly organic. The flavor was intense and I left feeling satisfied and not like a house.

My mom had the eggplant dish which was out of this world. Definitely give this restaurant/cafe a try but be a little patient as they just opened. The service was good and the owners/chefs are knowledgeable and passionate! I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great, fresh food. Creative. Truly delicious and nutritious. Salads, bowls, vegan options, wild caught salmon, all nicely spiced and expertly prepared. Friendly, welcoming owner, too."}
