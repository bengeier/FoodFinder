{"text":"I had the falafel sandwich and thought it was terrific. No, it did not have fancy accompaniments, but that's not what I was looking for and not what I expected. The balls were very well seasoned and there was plenty of tahini on the sandwich. I received fast and very friendly service. I will be going here often."}
{"text":"This little cart is a hot mess! Placed my order and waited, and waited. Didn't want to seem pushy-it was busy after all. I watched them start to lose track of who ordered what. 30 minutes later I step up and ask what happened to my order--seems reasonable. \"Oh, chicken gyro right? He's making it now...\" Just as I walked away, he calls me back \"so sorry, we're out of chicken, would like to order something else.\" I say \"are you kidding me, give me back my money and the tip I put in your jar.\" Thanks for wasting my time."}
{"text":"I don't much care for their pita bread, but even considering that, this is the best falafel in town. They make it fresh when you order it, they don't mind substitutions (I always get mine with out tomatoes and add eggplant) and they're very nice.  Definitely one of my top 5 places to eat in Madison. Probably top 3."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lamb Dinner. It was good. You could taste the seasoning on the lamb, the portion size was good and the hummus was good. I also ordered the falafel and that was good too. Overall rating: Good!   I'll be going back for sure."}
{"text":"As far as I can tell, the owner of the King of Falafel cart recently re-opened the King of Falafel restaurant as a take-out restaurant adjoining the new AmStar gas station on Park Street. It's a smaller operation, with a counter to order and no seating, and it can be easy to miss if you don't know where it is. There's no major signage out front other than a few small neon signs and no restaurant name is posted.  As for the restaurant itself, the food is quality and it's easy on the wallet. For $5.99, you can get the freshly prepared falafel sandwich just like the one you can get at the cart, plus good crispy fries and a soda (Pepsi products.) Most sandwiches include fries and a soda and run for $6-7. Larger entrees include a somewhat-lacking salad but have huge portions and run for $8-9.  If you go between 11am and 3pm on weekdays, they have a great special: two falafel/gyro/shawarma sandwiches, 2 drinks, and 2 fries for $9. It's a big menu, ranging from gyros to cheeseburgers to italian beef to reubens to fried chicken, but I've stuck with the Mediterranean food so far.  Overall, I'm happy this place is here. It's a bit like the restaurants in the Greektown section of Chicago: good, cheap Mediterranean food and you get a good portion. It's a welcome addition to a neighborhood where there previously wasn't much Mediterranean food.   As I mentioned, it's a smaller operation with minimal cooks, so there will be a 5-15 min. wait if you order at the counter. Best to call ahead if you can."}
{"text":"I live nearby and saw a sandwich shop opened up in the newly remodeled gas station but I'd never gone in it until I saw a review in the 'Isthmus'.  I've since eaten there a few times and have been really happy with them.  Something 'a little different' just down the street.  Food is good and prices are reasonable.  Thanks"}
{"text":"I've had gyros before in many places, but the gyro at King of Falafel & Grill is by far the best gyro I've ever had (it also happens to be Halal)! The taste is absolutely divine, and the actual gyro itself is big enough that it serves as both lunch and dinner for me personally. Also, the tzatziki sauce used is phenomenal, and the staff will even give you extra tzatziki on the side for no charge. I usually get the gyro combo meal with fries and a drink. I will definitely make myself a regular customer here :D"}
{"text":"I ordered the Italian Beef combo (Mild).  The fries were your typical small, fast-food joint fries. They weren't anything special. That is not necessarily a bad thing though. These were still good fries nonetheless in terms of seasoning and freshness.  The Italian Beef exceeded expectation in terms of quality. It was generous on the meat. It was not so moist that the bread was total mush--a place where Italian beefs get screwed up a lot. The veggies had a crunch and crispness to them. This gave me the impression that they were from fresh veggies chopped in store (as opposed to being premade veggie mush in a can).  The customer service was excellent. I called my order in, they had it ready with no delay, and they were more than friendly (conversational) upon my arrival. I was happy with the whole interaction.  I'll definitely be back! This place is a hidden gem and I'm truly excited to try their other menu items."}
{"text":"I tried King of Falafel for the first time today as it is near where I work.  When I arrived at 12:30 the place was empty except for a lone man eating at the one table in the space.  This is definitely a takeout joint, which I am happy about.  I ordered the Chicken Shawarma with Hummus for $8.99.  I received a full sow takeout container FULL of hummus and chicken on one side and a large salad of shaved lettuce and onions and sliced tomatoes (which were ripe) dressed with a light vinaigrette on the other.  My takeout bag also contained a packet of pita bread cut into wedges.  I enjoyed the entire meal.  It was huge, so I will be wanting a post-lunch nap this afternoon!  The hummus was flavorful and tangy.  The salad was fresh.  The chicken seemed a bit dry, but it was balanced by the savory hummus.  All in all I will visit King of Falafel again, not only for lunch but also to get an order to go after work to share with hubby for a light dinner."}
{"text":"speaking only for their falafels, i have to say; i have found the BEST in madsion. having a favorite falafel place back home it's been hard for me to find a falafel place that was equally as good.....until today. their falafels are crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, generous portion sized ball, and tasty!! i will be back again!! yummmmmm."}
{"text":"I ordered from their cart on the square and have to say it was not good. Twice now I've gone to their cart to order, and even went to the restaurant before it was taken over. The meats are spiced with such an intensity of cinnamon that it's all I could taste. I had the chicken kabob, gyro, and falafel and was not digging any of it on each occasion.   Time to move on."}
{"text":"Cheap is good.  Cheap without value is not good.  And that is where King of Falafel lands.  Yes, a sandwich with fries and a can of soda will only set you back ~$6 but the quality and taste just wasn't there.  I opted for a falafel and hummus sandwich.  The sandwich is served rolled like a burrito and the falafel and hummus filling left much to be desired.  The falafel was mushy and the hummus tasteless.  I think, maybe, possibly it was served with an unripe tomato.  It could have also been a pepper.  It shall remain a mystery.  Either way, it added nothing to the experience.  Fries were fine.   I feel Banzo sets the gold standard in all things falafel.  I knew, going in, that this standard would be hard to beat but didn't expect it would be that bad.  It was.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"I want to give the King of Falafel a higher review - really, I do! The operators are some of the nicest Food Truck operators around. They clearly like what they do and I believe they pour a lot of love into what they do. High level of service and attention. That's the reason for the 3 stars. A visit to their Food Truck is a happy experience but the food leaves a few things to be desired.   I have frequented the King several times because of my close proximity to their location. I am also a Falafel Fan. A self described Follower of Fava and a ground Chickpea Connoisseur. I've had a lot of falafel and halal food and enjoy it very much. I say that only to qualify what will be written later...  Let's start with the \"good\" - the prices at King of Falafel are what should become the \"new norm\" and baseline for the Madison Food Truck scene. You'll get just about anything on their menu for $6.00 or less. Both the falafel sandwich and gyro (the person in front of me ordered a Guy Roo - first time I have heard that...) are $6.00 each. The fact that King of Falafel sticks to creating Food Truck food at acceptable Food Truck prices makes me happy. They haven't jumped on to the Madison $8.00 Minimum Food Truck Bandwagon and I hope they never do...  The food here is satisfactory, acceptable, average, reasonable and any other synonym you can think of for \"satisfactory\".   It hurts to say this, but the falafel sandwich is not monarchy worthy. The falafel is dry and doesn't have the traditional falafel taste - in fact the taste of the actual falafel was quite bland. The tahini and white sauce do not compliment it like they should. The portion is good for the price (much more so than the gyro) but that is one of the only positives I can think of. The bread that they use is distinct but it doesn't hold up well to the contents. Lettuce and tomatoes are fresh. Just not what I want when I order a falafel sandwich.  The gyro left me wanting more also. It kind of screams \"mass produced\" gyro instead of \"Specialty Food Truck\" gyro. If I were to order a gyro to eat at Costco, this is what I would expect (although it would probably be a bigger portion and cost less at Costco). Yes, it tastes good. Exactly what you want to taste when eating a gyro. There was less than 10 thinly sliced pieces of meat on the sandwich and the tomatoes were actually just one tomato slice cut in half. I believe the sauce weighed more than the meat portion. The pita was fantastic, but again, doesn't deliver the Food Truck quality I want when stepping up to a window and order on the street. I finished eating it and wondered what/when I'll be eating next because I'm still hungry.   There are quite a few other menu options that could be very good but I focused on the falafel and gyro. This food cart is always busy and has a very good following so maybe I need to give them another chance on a new food item. They have been around awhile so they are clearly doing things right (Long live the King???).  I hope there isn't a coups d'état or a plan to overthrow the King of Falafel - although it isn't close to being the best falafel or Mediterranean food in town, the Kingdom is big enough for more than one self-described ruler! The food here wasn't my favorite but it is good to see a small operator succeed."}
{"text":"Very mediocre food. Nothing particularly bad about the food technically, but not great either.  I visited their food cart on Library Mall with a craving for falafel and Banzo wasn't there, so I decided to try something new. I ordered the falafel sandwich which came with hummus, tahini sauce, tomatoes, and parsley.  The falafel itself was okay, but truly lacked flavor.  The tahini sauce could barely be tasted and needed a boatload more garlic to be considered true tahini.  I was disappointed, as I expected authentic middle eastern food since the owners are Middle Eastern. I felt the sandwich needed more flavors to seem vaguely ethnic-some chopped onions or cucumbers would have helped immensely but certainly not redeemed the whole sandwich. It lacked flavor and authenticity.  However, the fact that the sandwich was only $6 helped, and it was filling so not a complete waste of money.  Moral of the story, if you're looking for flavorful falafel, head elsewhere. If you really have a dire craving, this might cut it."}
{"text":"This little cart of goodness is an underrated gem in my book.  I truly love food-cart food, but I frequently miss out on them due to my work schedule. But luckily, this cart has much more expansive hours than most, and can be found out in front of the UW Credit Union on the square almost all day long on weekdays. Breakfast falafel? Done. Gyro at 4pm?  Sure thing.   You can tell a food cart is good by certain earmarks. First, can you almost see the wafting scent of spices and grilled meats grabbing you by the nose and pulling you in, like a Looney-Toons mouse to a wheel of cheese? Does that smell make it hard for you to keep walking, beckoning you to just pause a moment and consider that wonderfull smell.   Next, if it is a foreign regional food cart, are there patrons from that region hanging out nearby and chatting with the owner?  You bet there are here. The fellow working there is always nice, chatting up his friendly regulars and working hard simultaneously. He always returns my salaams, and once gave me a free falafel ball to munch on while I waited, since my gyro was going to be a few minutes longer than normal. I told him it was no big deal, I didn't mind and extra minute. He gave it to me anyway and said, \"You try. You like. Falafel makes you happy.\"  Yes.  Yes it does.   But really, I come for their Gyro. It's simple, classic, and deliciously aromatic. It's so good, and reasonably priced, it's what I almost always get. It's my favorite gyro downtown. I was less of a fan of the chicken I tried once, but really I'm not here for the chicken, so I won't be sad about going back to my darling classic gyros.   Long story short, this cart consistently serves up delectable, hot, reasonably priced food all day. Don't fear the cart, embrace it."}
{"text":"I've eaten here close to a dozen times. Their gyros and shawarma are good, and the amount you get is quite a bit. Almost enough for two people. The fries are decent as well. They cook to order, so don't expect a quick in and out. An order takes about 5 minutes or so. The prices are also pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Great street Cart dining on the state Capitol square in Madison. The falafel was huge!  Really should have split it between the two of us. The kids enjoyed their burgers. My hubby really wanted a gyro but sadly they were out."}
{"text":"Friendly, Fast & Filling! I will make every effort to meet up again. I was looking for a Doner Kebab and the closest I could find on their memu was a Chicken Shwarma. The guys swapped to a beef-lamb for me and it was great. Thank you"}
{"text":"I should give this man another shot. I don't think it's fair for me to give a bad review based on one time visit there. Yeah, I don't really like the chicken shawarma. But some people buying the falafel seemed to enjoy theirs. So I may be back to try other stuff so I can give a more comprehensive review.  So far, the shawarma is a big no no for me.  But, I will be back and hopefully I can give them a 4 star rate."}
