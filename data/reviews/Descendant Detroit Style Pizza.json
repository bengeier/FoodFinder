{"text":"This is the closest to deep dish pizza you'll get in the city. It's the classy version of Pizza Hut (Pizza Haute?) so you don't have to shame eat it in secret. There's just enough grease to make it indulgent without feeling like you're destined to end up on one of those TLC shows about obesity. If you're feeling adventurous try the soppressata marmalade but I guarantee you'll wish you went with double pep (so make sure at least one person at the table orders it). The ingredients are top quality and the ambiance of the place is really laid back and funky. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Woo loved this place. In a really nice strip of Leslieville, this place makes for a great date night. Tbh I suggest sitting on the stools by the window so you get a a good people-watching view and take in the neighborhood. 

So the prices seem a lot when you first see it, but even one small pizza can be filling for two people. I would suggest two smalls or one large for two. With that being said, I could eat 1837 of them by myself. 

The quality of this pizza is amazing and the crust is to die for. Our service was great too - really friendly people. I liked this place so much, I went on realtor.ca to look up homes in this area lololol."}
{"text":"Now my favorite kind of pizza! Not as heavy as Chicago style, but definitely more filling and cheesy than a traditional thin crust. We tried both the sausage and peppers and the double pep. Can't wait to go back and try the others. Lost one star for the venue; it was a tiny place. Call for a reservation or try for off hours. Also, menu is small, not that it's a bad thing. They can focus more on their pizzas. However, it would've been nice to have appys or more dessert varieties."}
{"text":"Have ordered 3 times  - excellent service, pizza always ready when they say

Pizzas are beyond delicious - hands-down the best, most awesome flavour combinations ever."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday evening, the place is small but wasnt too pack and seats were available. I never had the Detroit style pizza before and decided go give this place a shot! Their mushrooms on the Our Canadian pizza was nicely sauteed, I dont recall having mushrooms on pizza being this juicy and tasty. The crust is nice and crispy. Being a cheese lover, I do wish it was a little bit more cheesier. I do find this place to be a little bit pricey. I still recommend going and probably order two small pizzas for two people so you can try few things rather than ordering one large."}
{"text":"I've never had Detroit style pizza before but I am now a fan. I had the double pepperoni and was surprise to find the crust very light and fluffy with crispy edges and great taste. I also had the Jafna which has an amazing combination of sweet, savory and spicy flavors. It is the best vegetarian pizza I've ever had. We were lucky at being seated within 5 min, but they only a few tables.The staff was friendly and service was fast. This place is definitely a treat."}
{"text":"I found the pizza here to be amazing. The quality is terrific.  It is hard to find areally good pizza in Toronto. I tried the truffle mushroom and the double pepperoni. Moith watering.  The price for the large is a bit too high as it called me almost $60 for 2 pizzas. One large one small.  I will have to go only once and awhile but I absolutely think this pizza is special and worth trying.  Just get the small ones."}
{"text":"Only two words i wanna say \"best pizza\" :)
Little hard to cut and chew the crust but taste so good lol. I wish i live close to this place!!"}
{"text":"Ive eaten here once before and couldnt stop thinking about it.  Great pizza with a traditional but unique twists.  Try the 'taliano for a more traditional or go totally off the board.  Service is great and i like that they serve some local micro brew beers.  Try this place."}
{"text":"Wow!  This cute small place serves the BEST deep dish pizza ever!  Where have you been all my life?  Been searching for you for so long, so happy my boyfriend found you and didn't keep this to himself! The restaurant is really small so all the tables were taken when we arrived at 8:30pm but it's worth the wait or you can just order and do a pick up like the few customers did.  But I think the pizza tastes a lot better when you dine in unless you live near by.  The staff are really friendly and attentive, great customer service!  After 15 minutes wait, we were seated and ordered 2 small deep dish pizzas: the classic pepperoni (4 slices) and electric avenue (4 slices).  The wait for our food was not long at all.   The pepperoni and cheese came first and we devour them right away.  Electric avenue (jerk chicken- can't order in Detroit I heard only in Toronto - cuz it's a multicultural city) came afterwards and it was A-mazing-ly delicious, never had pizza like this before.  The pizza had so much flavour, my taste buds were awake with happiness:) You can enjoy the pizzas with wine, beer, they have a nice list of beverages to choose from.  My bf had a cider which he enjoyed and I ended up with Baddlng Brooks Root Beer, the Best root beer I ever had.  If you are a fan of root beer try it out!  Located at Queen st east and Jones st, a relatively nice area.  Parking was easy, we parked on the street.  Or you can take the streetcar to get here, the stop is right outside.  Uber it, worth the drive to DDSP.  Give DDSP a try, you will not be disappointed. They are relatively new and I am really impressed how yummy their pizza are.  Price wise, it's a lot more but I didn't mind, it's so good!  Gonna go back next weekend:)"}
{"text":"Big fan of the Pizza here. Being from around Buffalo originally, there is a special place in my heart for the local varieties of American pizza. Detroit-style is a quasi Chicago type of pie that has the nice feature of not forcing you to write off an evening as the former tends to do. Obviously the key in this case is the crust, and let me tell you these guys do it right!  Absolutely delicious and their unique take on toppings and combinations are delicious without being so high brow as to make you feel like you're not eating an American-style pizza, catering to the usual cravings nicely. I suppose the one issue is the price, which is certainly on the high side, but this isn't your average pizza. As such, this is more of an occasional treat, but certainly a delicious one."}
{"text":"Checked this place out because of all the great reviews and it didn't disappoint. Pizza was awesome and tasty. My family and I shared the Double pepperoni and the Jafna. Both were delicious but the Jafna stood out with its very unique flavoring of mango chutney. Cool atmosphere with funky decor and artwork. Pricey for pizza but this isn't your everyday pizza. Limited seating so you might have to wait. Staff was friendly, service was good."}
{"text":"Descendent is my new go-to pizza place...I didn't even know that Detroit-style pizza was a thing! The dough, though thick, is airy and light with cheese baked/slightly burnt on the outside of the crust....I will save you some time and suggest you get their \"sausage and peppers\" pie....it's exceptional. Their \"white pie\" is delicious as well. 

The only thing that would make them better is delivery service. They reliably take about 20 mins for your order. To save time, I call ahead and pick it up. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city. It was the Best pizza in the world, before they got rid of the marmalade pizza. They often are sold out before they close so place your order ahead of time. Crust is incredible and top quality topping.
Enjoy!"}
{"text":"After a long wait to visit descendants.....my husband and I finally made it there and we were Not dissappointed. The manager had been very friendly and attentive and the pizza was just right! Fresh ingredients with a spice that had the right amount of kick. We ordered the pepperoni sausage pizza and no regrets. Great to sit in or takeout. This is the first pizza place in the city that we can say is a PIE. Nicely done Descendants!"}
{"text":"Last night we decided to make the long streetcar journey to Leslieville to give this joint a try after reading some positive reviews. I called in an order for a large take-out pepperoni about 20 minutes out from the restaurant, kicked back, and enjoyed all of the interesting sights that one sees traveling east on Queen on the TTC. 

The staff greeted me when I entered the restaurant, and had my pizza ready to go immediately. Because they knew my name from the order, they used it throughout the transaction- the personal touch was great! The interior is on the smaller side, but definitely enough seating for anyone wanting to dine-in on a Wednesday night. I, however, strongly suggest bringing a blanket and taking your pizza to the park next door to eat while the weather is still nice.  

I can't describe in words how good this pizza is. The crust is so oily and crunchy, and the tomato sauce is the most perfect blend. Topped off with crispy pepperoni and mounds of cheese, I'm drooling right now thinking about it. 

We ended our night at the Underground Comedy Club down the street to catch an open mic. I highly suggest this exact scenario as a date option!"}
{"text":"Finally some flavorful pizza!

As a transplant from NYC area, I miss pizza. The food in the GTA is some of the best in the world -  but except for a few places, in my humble opinion, this beautiful wonderful amazing part of the globe is a pizza desert. Most places don't age their dough right, sometimes don't proof it, and most of the time use just mozzarella as the only cheese. Good pizza has good dough, a very worked on cheese blend not just mozzarella, and a simple but tasty sauce with minimal ingredients and fillers. Descendant hits the nail on the head for what you need to do to make good pizza.

Never have I been to Detroit, but this style reminds me of what you would call a Grandma pizza from NYC area places or even a Sicilian pizza too. Not the same, it's its own unique thing this pizza @ Descendant. Asked for a basic cheese pizza to get a feel for what they are all about and their TRUFF-GHI pizza too. 

On the simple cheese pizza, you can see how this place gets so much right about making good pizza. The dough had a great texture and flavor. The cheese to me seemed like they used a good blend and it was perfect. The sauce was simple and flavorful no complicated crap. Good pizza all around. The TRUFF-GHI pizza was an instant favorite. I got it without bacon so Descendant is vegetarian accommodating. This pizza is super thoughtful, and I don't use that word with pizza often. There are fresh herbs and just a touch of lemon zest with a mayo-truffle sauce and very top-notch mushrooms all over this beauty. The chef really rolled up their sleeves on this one and made a great pizza.

Only thing I will say is that I wish they had some more vegetarian special pies on the menu. Really wanted to try their R2D2 pizza which they show on their website, but apparently it's a special item pizza that doesn't stay on the menu full time and wasn't there when I went. So I was a little bummed not being able to try this even though it was on the website. The waitress told me it's better to check their twitter account to see what pizzas are in rotation. So if you're into seeing what cool creation the chef is dreaming up of go check their twitter before you go.

Service here is awesome as well -  everyone is super nice, friendly, and accommodating. The server gave my kid some stuff to draw with which I didn't expect at a pizza place, but of course I always appreciate when servers are family minded. Parking I found to mostly be street parking so keep that in mind. If you have children and want to combine eating with something for the kids to do, there is a park right next to the place which is a win win.

All in all one of my favorite pizza places now in the GTA -  can't see anyone doing a pan cooked pizza better than these guys at all."}
{"text":"I am not sure why this place such such high ratings. I tried this place today. I ordered truff ghii. It was bland and absolutely no flavor. I could see bacon bits in it but couldn't taste it at all. My husband tried sausage and peppers thinking it would be spicy. The pizza turned out on the sweet side and again, no real flavor. We asked for some hot sauce and we're charged $1.50 for it. Disappointed. Not worth the $$$. We spent $60 on 2 small pizzas and a beer and came out quite dissatisfied. Double Ds Chicago style pizza much much better and it's a block away. Dont waste your money guys if you have taste for good pizza.
The service wasn't great even when we were the only ones there. When we were done eating, we kept waiting for someone to show up with a bill. After 20 minutes, my husband went up to the counter to ask for the bill and was rudely told to wait at the table. The server was continuously on the phone, even when he brought us our pizzas."}
{"text":"OMG. The Jahfna is heaven in my mouth. Two amazing worlds unite and bring so much joy to my taste buds. I aslo tried the trufghi which is also great but the jahfna is out of this world."}
{"text":"The pizza crust here is incredibly delicious!!  It puts most other doughy crusts to shame.  We had the double pep and the truff ghi.  Try the Vernors soda, very Detroit.  It is worth the wait for the pizza.  Make a reservation."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place. I just stumbled upon it while out with my kids. I had been craving legit deep dish pizza for a while.

It was almost a spiritual experience. Sat down for a large pepperoni. The pepperoni itself was perfect. Perfect blend of cheese and sauce. The crust was amazing. I don't know how many times I can say perfect about this pizza.

The flavours lingered in my mouth for at least an hour afterwards. They had an inexpensive beer there as well that matched perfectly with the pizza. It was the best pizza I've had in years."}
{"text":"How do I not give this place 5 stars? If you love pizza you owe it to yourself to give this place a try, even if you don't love pizza give this place a try. I just had the pepperoni pizza and it was amazing, every pizza at the table was amazing, we all shared because everyone at the table was like, \"Oh man, you gotta try this.\""}
{"text":"The crust was burnt and tough, the pepperoni was a slight bump up from Pizza Pizza quality. The staff touched multiple disgusting things in front of me and did not wash their hands before getting back to food service. 

Also worth noting, they contacted me to \"resolve my review\". Before I could respond  \"someone\" reported it as off topic. Just save yourself the trouble and go to Libretto or Queen Margherita."}
{"text":"One of Toronto's most unique and delicious pizzas. Please open a west side outlet, the drive cross town is long (albeit totally worth it!)"}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch and had the Soppressata Marmalade pizza with my wife. It was really something special - the honey and chiles and meat combine together to make it one of the best pies I've had in a long time, and the Detroit style (square pan crust with a good crunch) made it a fantastic knife and fork pizza. Eat here!"}
{"text":"Took a blind chance of this place. Had no idea what \"Detroit\" style pizza was. We were looking for a pizza option outside of our standard Pizzaiolo default. The Double Pepp seemed to be the safest bet and we were very pleased. Great combo of tastes, nice crusty pepperoni and  the pizza crust was insanely delicious. Note: Price is very high for size of pizza. With taxes and tip we paid $40 for their version of a large pizza.  Good for only two hungry people for sure. But, if you're looking to eat a couple slices of great pizza and are tired of your standard options give them a try. Service was friendly and pizza was great. Support local business :))"}
{"text":"We have tried to order a pizza for pick up three times in the last couple of months at 730pm and they had already ran out of dough.  I can understand once but three times?"}
{"text":"This place is best summed up as pizza hut on steroids. Dare I say the crust was my favourite part? It was so thick, crispy and filled with delicious cheese. We tried the Sopressata Marmalade and Sausage and Peppers pizza. The Sopressata Marmalade was delicious for the first few bites but the hot honey was a bit too sweet for me afterwards. I prefer a savoury pizza. The Sausage and Peppers was very good and packed with toppings. I hope they bring back the Hawaiian pizza soon as i would def come back for it. 

What also stands out is their amazing service. Our server was extremely attentive and we could tell that he was very passionate about the pizza. In fact, all the workers were very engaged with the customers and extremely friendly. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The best way to describe the pizza at Descendant is that I had already eaten a hefty poutine at a bar down the street, and despite not being hungry, I still devoured four slices of pizza without a second thought.

The secret is in the crust, or rather lack-of-crust.  The crust is essentially baked cheese that falls behind the pizza creating a delicious savoury crusty and cheesy edge that's very similar to the corner piece of a lasagna.  To say that it's absolutely delicious would be an understatement.

The pizza was so good, that I came back the next day for more pizza.

So far I've had: Double Pep, Soppressata Marmalade (Day 1), and Margherita, Sweet Sweet Corn (Day 2)

My faves are the Margherita and the Sweet Sweet Corn.  The simple Margherita is fantastic because there's enough cheese that the flavour doesn't get lost in the rest of the pizza, and they put a nice dollup of tomato sauce on top, so that when you cut/bite into it, the sauce doesn't ooze all over your plate.  The Sweet Sweet Corn slides in at a close second, because of the great cheese blend, and the really nice combination of sweet/spicy chilis and the double-smoked bacon.

If you have the will power, I recommend waiting a bit to let the pizza cool for the cheese to settle before devouring.  That way you can taste all the savoury flavours of the cheese that often gets masked when the pizza is too hot.

As for the dining environment, seating is somewhat small and limited, so I recommend either making reservations, or ordering for take-out (which appears to be the most popular method for most people).

Overall, it's hands-down my new fave pizza place.  I don't believe any other pizza place comes close to making something similar.  A definite MUST VISIT, if you're a pizza lover like myself."}
{"text":"BEST PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD. In my whole life I have never had better pizza. I am honestly afraid for my health because I live within two blocks of this place. 

This pizza is perfection. I subjected my daughter to it and feel extremely guilty because now she will be hooked on this crack pizza. What have I done. 

It's chewy and crispy at the same time. It is baked exactly right. The sauce is perfect. The cheese OHMYGOD and I just can't anymore. These dudes have COMPLETELY figured out pizza and I am dying."}
{"text":"Ordered and took the pizza home. Did not eat in, but very busy. Wait time around 25 mins. Very thick pizza, think pizza lasagna. Wonderful sweet tomato sauce, thick, tasty, cheesy crust. Simply one of the best pizzas we've had. Expensive, but well worth it. You'll never view the pizza 'norm' in the same way again."}
{"text":"First time here and ordered the JAFFNA. Amazing!!! Plenty of toppings. The crust was crunchy yet soft on the inside. It tasted just as amazing when toasted later in the day or the next day!! Need to return to try the other pizzas!!!!"}
{"text":"The soppressata marmalade is amazing. Best deep dish pizza I've ever had. The motor city blows the windy city out of the water here."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday evening with a reservation and it's a good thing - the place was rammed with people trying to fill their pie holes. 

1) This is the most satisfying pizza I've had in the city
2) A small is a good size for a hungry person
3) They're so friendly
4) NIN and QOTSA playing on the speakers
4) I had very high hopes / expectations based on the Yelp reviews and a glowing article in the Globe and Mail... and my first DP experience still pleasantly surprised me. It was awesome- but I'm going to have to limit myself to bi-weekly because I'll get heart disease prematurely if not. I really liked eating too much here."}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of thin crust pizza so I was hoping for the best when we decided to check out Descendant Pizza. Decided to try the \"Homenaje\" pizza, small size shared between 2 people. 

OMG. Heaven. The crust was actually really good. The chorizo with the cilantro sour cream topped with pickled onions complimented the flavours very well. 

We opted for takeout but I think next time we'd try and dine it. If it tasted amazing even after 30 mins I can't imagine how good it would be fresh outta the oven!"}
{"text":"A must try place for all foodies !
The crust of the pizza is its signature"}
{"text":"House made Tobasco Ranch Sauce. No more words needed. This place was beyond worth the 45-minute wait. Would do it again and again.. their pizzas are decadent, light, yet jam packed with so many layers of flavour.

Don't let the wait deter you, there is a microbrewery spot right across the street- awesome intimate interior with wonderful, dark wood bar and awesome tap beers.  

The truff ghi and the sergeant peppers were life changing.

BONUS: the Easy Stout beer surpassed my expectations. SO DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"This is a small friendly pizza joint in Leslieville.
I've been here 3 times since I moved to the beaches.
I highly recommend the Sopressata dipped in a bit of garlic honey.. It is the best pizza I've ever had.

Warning: it will be hard to ever go back to eating regular pizza after you try this."}
{"text":"I heard about this place through a friend and I cannot emphasize this enough - this pizza is magical! 

The crust is coated in cheese and it's a deep dish cheese crusted pizza - they have a small menu with elaborate ingredients and amazing flavours - since I've gone here, I made a promise that I wouldn't have pizza again In Toronto unless it was from here because it was THAT good.  

A MUST try . You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Tried the Janfna and the Pepperoni Pizzas dine in. Pizza is bomb. Love the crust and square slices. Staff is friendly. Decor is really good. Saw lots of people getting take out. Price is the same and (cheaper in some cases) than your Pizzavilles and Panagos. Definetly worth a retuen visit. P.S. Street parking is cheap"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, once as sit in and another time as delivery because I was craving their pizza so badly. 

I'm usually not a fan of thicker crust pizza but they manage to make a thick crust pizza where the crust feels light, yet is perfectly crunchy on the edges without being overly greasy or doughy. 

I've tried the Soppressata Marmalade, Sausage and Peppers, and Truff-ghi. The Truff-ghi was my favourite, such an complimentary assortment of delicious flavours. The mushrooms were super flavourful and the caramelized onions add a nice sweet touch. You can tell they take time pairing all the flavours to make really great pizzas."}
{"text":"Honestly the best pizza I've ever had. So juicy, fluffy, and flavourful.  I'll never forget this pizza."}
{"text":"Descendant pizza has been on my Radar for a while  now. Their Mouth-Watering Instagram page is more effective than a Multi-Millions Dollar Marketing Campaign, and it shows with a long waiting list to get a table, take out order pouring at all times, and a really busy staff.

But how is it really. Hows the food

Once you put aside the instagram fame, the hype and the rest. Whats left?

Descendant pizza offers a limited menu of Detroit Style Pizza and they are succesfully living up to the hype while leaving me with a small disappointement.

First. Pizza is the focus. There is no side, no fries, no nothing. Just pizza. And thats great as long as your pizza can just wow everyone to a point that nothing else matters.

This is a very well executed detroit style pizza, i think the one i had in detroit seems a bit more 'authentic' but this is probably just in my mind. The flavours is where it gets... well boring?

Dont get me wrong. The pizza are flavourful and well prepared but theres really nothing that new here. All thoses combinations of flavours i had in the past somewhere else. And i know we cant reinvented the wheel. But with such a promising base, i hope descendant would take more risks. 

This is a 'new-ish' restaurant and maybe down the line they will push new idea forward, till then. 

Good pizza, Well executed, Flavourful, Nothing New"}
{"text":"We came by on Saturday afternoon after biking at the TTP and we were starving! Luckily, the place was pretty empty -- it's a small place so it can definitely fill up quickly. 
There were so many delicious looking options, but we ended up splitting a small sausage and peppers, and man! It was good! it's a little bit spicy, overflowing with cheese, and the saltiness from the sausages balance nicely with the sweet peppers and tomato base. I have nothing i could complain about about the food!! 
I wish the sizing were a bit different though, I could have eaten 3/4 of the small pizza by myself comfortably, but it was either get 2 small pizzas of different flavours and bring 1/2 of a small home, or split a small one. I was full -- don't get me wrong, but i was not satisfied.. i want more! I wish the small were just slightly smaller so it can be personal size and we can get different flavours to sample.. but even if the size stays the same.. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I was recently in Vancouver for a week visiting family and basically eating at one amazing restaurant after another. It was depressing to think that Toronto doesn't come close to the culinary bar that Vancouver has set, but eating at Descendant last night proved otherwise. 

I'm still thinking about the White Pie and the Hawaiian we had. The flavours were perfectly married and the thick, yet light and fluffy crust complemented the toppings so well.  The thickness of the dough didn't make me feel weighed down.  It was nice and airy with a perfect chew to it. 

There's something magical about this pizza. I wish it was closer to where I live, but that won't stop me from making the 40 min TTC trek down.  I can't wait to try the other ones. 

Go to the Instagram page @descendant_pizza, drool over the pics, and then get your ass over there early and enjoy."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Very talented and experimental place adorns their addictively chewy-crunchy deep pan crusts with surprising and adept toppings.

Had the Truff Ghi a few times and the pepperoni and one other, I actually hated the Truff Gui the first few slices because it's so unexpected, the drizzle and the fresh thyme. It's brilliant, even cold. You don't even discover the bacon right away because of the careful hand in combining ingredients.

I was less convinced by the Pineapple / Jerk Chicken Electric Avenue but it also wasn't bad. They keep changing the menu before I can try things. Damn! where is the pizza on the web page with cherry tomatoes and basil? I want that. FOMO.

The pizzas really look great too, or at least they look like they were built to taste great. There is some real culinary passion here.

Descendant will be a significant part of my carbs budget I allow myself since I don't really eat starches as a staple food. Check it out & don't afraid to be friendly to the warm staff and kitchen."}
{"text":"If you don't believe in love at first sight, you should at least believe in love at first bite. That's how I felt when I took the first bite of their Truff-Ghi pizza:)"}
{"text":"Don't know quite how to rate this one. 

Pizza was really really good.  Menu is short and a bit too limited.  It really is ONLY pizza.  Food gets a 4.5. 

Service.  After two visits the service nets out at average or slightly below.   First visit was great although it was quite early and they started by saying \"order fast we have limited dough left\".  We thought that was a bit odd.  Not really a service problem per se.   Second visit service was just too cool, rushed and we didn't feel overly welcomed.  Service is a 2.5. 

Venue....hmmm.   I respected the art.  My wife felt afraid.  It was curious and begged some thought.  I wouldn't bring a small child here at night.  Maybe not even during the day.   It was dark and hipster cool.   But not overly comfy and the open kitchen was a blessing and a curse.    

Hygiene.  The place was clean.  I will give them that.  The owner was there and we watched in amusement as he would: decorate a pizza, touch machinery and storage bins, hike his baggy jeans, adjust his ball cap, then back to food.  It became a game for us to see how many unclean things he could touch before returning to food.   It kinda grossed us out.  If we were truly concerned we would have left so it was more amusing than anything.   And a bit gross.  I'd give it like a 2 on that whole aspect.    

What's most important?   Well.  All of it.  You go out for a meal.  And you pay good money.  The art of the game for restaurateurs is to deliver all of these things a price point that represents value.  It's not easy to do.   

If it were me, I would slightly adjust the art to eliminate the dead women with eyes gouged out, diligently train \"friendly\" into my servers and keep the open kitchen but proudly show off \"best in class\" hygiene - wash stations (being used) hair nets, clean white uniforms.   That's just me.  

I do hope this place sticks around or at least starts a trend because the pizzas were really yum.    


UPDATE.  I upped my rating.  And I will have to drag my wife back.   It appears from the pictures that they have updated the wall art.   Pretty sure the skeleton death bug and the woman with mouth stitched closed (hanging from noose?) are now pink hearts.   Hey.  I get it.   And I can see how me lady didn't dig it like I dug.   And I'm sure one pic had the owner wearing (gasp...sell out!) a white like chefs coat.    I love that.  When feedback actually gets heard.  It takes immense courage to let your customers collaborate with you to make it success.  That is super cool.  Respect.      Definitely will be back soon.    

Melted cheese is one of my favourite things."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm not really a deep dish type of pizza fan. I love thin crust pizza, but this was SO GOOD! I split a small truff-ghi with my wife and it was delicious and different. The combination of flavors was amazing. And to think I was going to go with the pepperoni! I definitely recommend the truff-ghi. It was also very filling, I could barely finish two slices. The space is small, but I had no problem getting a table for two on a Saturday for lunch. I will say the service was a bit slow, but it got better as time went on."}
{"text":"We have been  waiting for more than an hour for our pizza. Their priority seems to be the delivery orders rather then the orders of the customers at the tables. I can not comment on the food yet since our food has not been served yet. Having said that, the employees apologized and cover our bill as a gesture. We will pay for our food if we get it.

Well,our order finaly came and it had pork in it. We had said that we did not want pork in our pizza. So after waiting for 1 hour and 20 minutes. I am still hungry and we are leaving."}
{"text":"Dope pizza every time!  Nice fluffy dough for sure, but it's filling.  My wife an I always split a small because that's all we need."}
{"text":"I used to say that Toronto is not a good pizza town.

Decendant (and some others) are changing that story. 

If you've never had Detriot style pizza this place manages to recreate and in some ways surpass even revered institutions like Buddy's in Motown. 

As a bonus, less murder!

(I kid, Detriot is cool and kinda proud of their murder rates)

The TRUFF-GHI may, in fact, be the pizza I've ever had and I've been described as \"well nourished\"."}
{"text":"Descendant pizza is a hip little pizza parlour in Leslieville. Great art on the walls, for sale by local artists. Otherwise the beautiful graffiti walls are true to the neighbourhood. The place is small and can only sit 20-25 people, so take away is a good option. The staff was very friendly and polite checking on us a few times and engaging in some small chat. 

This is Detroit style deep dish pizza, so thick, greasy and delicious filling pizza. The home made stye and fresh ingredients were awesome. The menu was small but they have perfected the pizzas. The prices are rather high for the small quantities but you are paying for quality and not quantity. The pizza is filling and you will take home leftovers. 

If i'm in Leslieville, I'll be eating here again. Pizza lovers add this to your lists!  


Recommendation: Sausage and Peppers Pizza - Sweet Peppers,, lots of sauce, thick cheese, salty/spiced sausage, thick fluffy bread and golden crust. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to visit this place; I've never had deep dish pizza before! And I was not disappointed. It was absolutely delicious. The crust was perfectly crispy, while the inside remained gooey and cheesy.
Shared the white pie with a friend: very good. I'd like to return to try another type, because their menu looked very interesting (albeit quite small). 
Overall: very good experience. The restaurant is beautifully decorated, too; I enjoyed looking at the art during my meal."}
{"text":"-40 minute wait for 1 pizza? Seriously!? There was only 3 tables including ours
-Waitress did not refill our water once
-30 dollars for 8 squared slices, I was expecting delicious pizza (tasted really salty) 

I'm a huge pizza fan, I eat pizza all the time and I'm constantly trying new places. I follow pizza Twitter accounts, I dream about pizza in my pizza pyjamas... ok maybe not but I freakin love pizza and this place makes my inner pizza fan want to die. Bad service, mediocre food, will not be returning."}
{"text":"Tried the Truff-Ghi and Pepperoni pizza. 
Very scrumptious and filling. 
The deep dish Detroit style pizza is nothing less than a heaven for pizza lovers. 
Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've gotta say this is one of my favourite pizza places in the GTA. The service was fantastic. I even got to have a quick chat with the owner and had an amazing conversation. We ordered three 8x10 pizzas for the 4 of us and it was just the right amount. 

The pizzas had amazing flavour and the crust was bang on. 

All four of us would definitely come back and try some of the other delicious pizzas they had on the menu."}
{"text":"Love pizza? You gotta try this! No love for pizza? You still gotta try this! 

Why? Well, this was probably the best pizza I've ever had. Yes, the best. It's possible. Huzzah! A pan pizza that's not under cooked in the middle - major bonus points.

Descendant has definitely lived up to its hype. Nestled in the middle of Leslieville; the resto may be small, but they are packed full of flavour. 
Having to have grown up in this area, it's nice to see a successful small business, booming in this (now) up-and-coming area. 

The small came in (4) pieces; enough to fill 2 people! Of course, being the gluttonous pizza fiends we are, we opted for 2 smalls. 

Both the 'Sausage & Peppers' and the 'Truff-ghi' was delish, and done perfectly. Just the right amount of crust, crispy on the outside, chewy inside, and not at all greasy or soggy.

Coming from the west end, this was worth the drive. Go give it a try! I`m still dreaming about it."}
{"text":"We ordered the Jaffna pizza, which is a vegetarian pizza that is based off the kothu roti and kothu paratha dishes from Sri Lanka and South India respectively, and it was definitely one of the most unique pizzas I have ever had. I had indian style pizzas before, but this pizza wasn't completely the indian style and had its own twist.

The pizza is a thick crust pizza, and is layered with the chopped up and stir fried roti on top. It is coated with a masala flavor, and is topped with some peppers and garnish. It is also covered with this mango chutney and flavored yogurt. All of it combined gives you a flavor that is savory with a kick of spiciness as well as a pleasant sweet taste of the chutney and the yogurt. This is usually not a combination you hear from pizza, but it works. The only negative comments I give this pizza are that the crust to roti ratio is big, but it may be because I love kothu roti and expected more of it considering that this pizza is based off of that. And the pizza might be a tad bit sweet, but that is only because I prefer savory food anyways. 

I am giving this place 5 stars because of the uniqueness of the pizza and how I enjoyed the taste, as well as the customer service. These people are extremely nice people who will ensure that the pizza comes out properly and will go out of their way to compensate if they make a mistake or just aren't able to get the pizza to you as expected. You will never hear about this pizza anywhere else, so it is one of a kind. If you are in the area, this is definitely worth a visit, and I will be back here again next time!"}
{"text":"Wow! OMG! Truly Amazing Orgasm of the Taste Buds!

I was recently able to go to Chicago and try authentic deep dish pizza for the first time at two different establishments. Then I wanted to know if there was anything similar to it available in Toronto and came across this place. I was not aware of Detroit style pizza and I am so glad I didn't have to go to Detroit to try it!

This pizza was everything I dreamed and imagined it would be. If you don't love this pizza place then you don't like good pizza and have very poor taste. I've been looking at pictures of their pizzas for over two weeks and I could not wait any longer. I had to have it today by all means. 

It was around lunch time and I managed to convince my co-worker to have this pizza with me for lunch. We called ahead for pick up and they said 20 minutes so we waited about 10 and headed to Descendant's. It was ready when we arrived and it was nice and fresh and hot, steaming from the boxes. The aroma filled the car as we headed back to the office teasing our senses. 

I ordered the SOPPRESSATA MARMALADE which was my first choice and he ordered the \"HOMENAJE\" which would have been my second choice. Third on my list is the DOUBLE PEP fourth is the WHITE PIE and rounding up the list at five is the SAUSAGE & PEPPERS.

We had already decided to swap a piece each so we could try both. The first bite of mine was like dying and going to pizza heaven. The honey and chilis created a good mix of sweet and hot and the accompanying meat and cheese just brought everything together. Then I took a bite of my piece of the homenaje and it was just as good! If you love Mexican food and Pizza, this is the one you want to try! 

I think it's safe to assume that no matter which version of their pizza you try, you will not be disappointed. I can't wait to try all the rest myself! They truly have taken their time to put together the best ingredients to create the most delicious pizza you will ever eat! Based on all of their success so far, I would love to see more locations in the future so that everyone has a chance to try their pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is absolutely amazing - deep dish and surprisingly not greasy at all (I don't know how they do it), just nice and crispy! I recommend the Soppressata Marmalade."}
{"text":"Excellent service, with a smile! And the fungi deep pan pizza (without bacon) was absolutely divine. Also, no need to get greedy here...2 adults can easily share the smaller size pizza. Love this place. Wish their were other meat alternatives here except for everything pork!!"}
{"text":"Wow. 
This pizza blew me away. I've never had pizza like this before. A couple friends and I split two small pizzas which was the perfect amount. The pizzas are deep with a truly delicious crust. 
We tried \"The good ole days\" as well as the \"Sopresatta\" (sp?).
The former was a tasty pizza that I have nothing to complain about, in fact I found the red onions gave it a really nice kick of flavour. The \"Sopresatta\" on the other hand, took pizza to a new level for me. It was a revelation. The flavours jumped off the slice to punch me right in the taste buds. I haven't been this impressed with a pizza in a very long time. Great combination of sweet, and salty flavours.

I would recommend these pies to one and all. I would be happy to come back and eat here again!"}
{"text":"I have studied pizza and it's many incarnations for over 4 decades and Descendant Detroit pizza has opened my eyes to the glory I had yet to experience. It's as if I was blind and can now see. Simply put :Spectacular pizza. The crust is the shining star yet the cheesy goodness and well spiced sauce is on point. If u are into a pan of nirvana check this place out.  We got basic pies as a starting point, one cheese and one pepperoni. I can't wait to try their other signature pizzas. Great service and decent beer selections are the icing on top of mans greatest creation.  If you are a New York or Chicago style fan, pump the brakes and check out the Motor City Magic!  I've found my answer to the age old question of \" if you were trapped on a deserted island and you had one thing to eat for the rest of your life.\""}
{"text":"This place was great. Service was fantastic. The two pizza's I tried were great. The truff-ghi which is vegetarian was absolutely fantastic - stole the show in my opinion. The other one we got had sausage and peppers, which was also quite good but not as good as the truff-ghi."}
{"text":"It is such a joy when hype lives up to reality. Honestly this place is a GEM! 

So we came here because toronto life named the Jaffna the best pizza in Toronto. Now that is something hard to live up to and I always have an eye roll for \"fusion food\". I have had my fair share of Kottu Roti and other Sri lankan food and was skeptical that a detroit style pizza joint in Toronto would be able to execute this.

I was wrong.

The Jaffna is pure perfection. The flavours are spot on - not as spicy as the kottu roti I have had but its got a wonderful slow burn. Everything on that pizza serves a purpose - a great balance of sweet, savoury, sour - honestly really really good. 

We also got the sausage and peppers pizza which didn't wow me as much but it is a really, really good pizza. I think it was hard to follow the Jaffna.

Less than 24 hours later and I am dreaming about this pizza. Will be back!"}
{"text":"As a proud Tamil-Canadian with roots in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, I grew up on mouthwatering, aromatic spices, chutneys, and the carby wonders of kothu roti. Imagine my excitement upon discovering that Descendant combined allathese elements in my favourite food group: pizza!  
As I sunk my teeth into the aptly named 'Jaffna' pizza, my tastebuds drowning in the scrumptious and heady mix of sweet and spicy, textured flavours on cheese pizza, my neurons went haywire. Kothu roti, mango chutney, cilantro, onion, chilies, coconut sambol...oh my! I momentarily died and was transported to the heaven of my simple, sunny childhood of scraped knees, mango trees and the aromas and tastes of Amma's cooking. When I finally came to, I found that the pizza was finished and my date was in a similar comatose state. I AM NOT PRONE TO EXAGGERATION. This happened. I must somehow obtain the Jaffna pizza recipe, attempt to replicate it, and make this my life's work. I will be returning to this cozy pizza joint, and bringing my entire village with me!"}
{"text":"FINALLY - An amazing pizza joint in Toronto. I can't tell you how long I've been searching for excellent pizza in this City. After moving to the East side things only got harder. This place is so good I think it will raise the value of real estate in Leslieville."}
{"text":"Big hype... but not so big in taste...

I ordered the small (overpriced?) pepperoni and I found the pepperoni slices to be too dry. Also wasn't a fan of the hard caramelized crust; it hurts my teeth... 

Overall, it's alright but I'd rather eat Delissio pizza..."}
{"text":"I haven't been wow'ed by a restaurant, let alone a pizza place, in ages. This place just hits the spot in every right way! I had been waiting to go here for weeks to try the deep dish Jaffna (kothu roti - Sri Lankan inspired) pizza, and man did this dish live up to the hype. Most vegetarian pizza gets really boring after a while, but not this one! Trust me - it's different from anything you'll ever taste in your life. The flavors were just so perfect, with the cilantro and mango adding a tang of sweetness to the chilis. Apparently, the pizza is baked twice so the crust becomes perfectly crispy while the inside remains the epitome of soft and chewy baked goodness. I've honestly never had better pizza in any city I've been to and am still craving this pizza today. Props to them for blending two such different cuisines together! Though I only had the Jaffna pizza, I saw and smelled the dishes of everyone around us and everything smelled soo tempting.

Protip: Order a small (8x10 - 4 slices) to share between two people. It was the perfect amount of food for us, and I didn't see any couple in the restaurant that was able to finish the large by themselves. 

Not only was the food amazing, but the staff were also incredibly kind and helpful. When our pizza was taking longer than expected, they offered us drinks on the house. Now THAT is the kind of service that more restaurants in Toronto need to learn from!

I can't wait to come back to Descendent Detroit Style Pizza! It's a bit pricey, but you leave feeling totally satisfied and the flavors can't be found anywhere else."}
{"text":"I came here abt 1.5 hours to closing and was told that they simply ran out. I was extremely disappointed! After reading some reviews of others saying that they have been turned away due to no dough, you would think a business would make sure this doesn't happen so frequently. I'll just go to Little Caesars to get some deep dish pan pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is a little pricey (small size is just over $20 after tax), but delicious. Ordered the Jafna (Kothu Roti pizza!!!) and  Double Pepporoni. The Jafna was easily my favorite and in fact one of the best pizzas that I've had to date. This was an easy 5 star. The Double Pep was pretty good too. 

I've had a few South Asian pizzas before, but nothing has been even remotely close to Jafna. It was a very unique combination of flavors that worked really well together. In particular the mango chutney was a great idea. It really is the perfect ingredient for this \"Sri Lankan pizza\". I'm a major cilantro fan, so  I liked that component a lot too. I didn't get a strong taste of the Kothu Roti  though. 

My only complaint about the Double Pep was that there it did not seem to have a lot of pepperoni. From the name, I expected it to be pretty loaded. Also, the taste, while still great, was not as special as the Jafna. I think next time I visit, I'm going to stick to the more unique flavors. 

The pizza base/ crust is excellent. The base, though thick, is fairly soft. The crust is easily the best pizza crust I've had as well (I've never had Detroit style pizza before, so not sure how it compares to the standard). Its covered with crispy cheese. Most of the time, I don't even eat the pizza crust, but I devoured this.

I'll definitely be back, although at this price point only occasionally."}
{"text":"What just happened. I'm so confused. 

I have been eating pizza here forever - it's where my fiancé and I went on our third date. We go at least once a month, and that's a lot considering it's a far trek. We also recommended this place to so many people and often take double dates here.

My previous review was a good one because I like eating here. I've written tips for this place that are positive. My last tip - that I hate cilantro and I wish they wouldn't include it - was more about me than it was about them. You can read it. It actually wasn't negative at all - still love this place and follow them on Instagram, hence I'm always so sad when they have a new pizza with cilantro !

But the owner just sent me a bunch of nasty messages. I had read about him doing this before and I wonder, when your establishment has almost all positive reviews, why you care to hound people  and obsess over anything you interpret to be negative. I have never experienced that with any other restaurant and I've been Elite for 7 years.  Dude - I like your place. I didn't say anything except ew cilantro. There's no \"facts\" I need to check.  You're ruining it for yourself because now I sure as Hell don't want to leave my positive review up.  

Whoever works here, stop letting this guy manage your social media. This was one of my fave places in the city and it breaks my heart that they are so wound up they can't see the forest from the trees. Guess it's not just the cilantro that turns me off.

NB they do have cilantro cream sauces at times so be sure to ask. #itisinthesauce

Edit: he could have instead written me, \"Hey Amelia! We actually have a lot of pizzas without cilantro, or you could always ask for it without! Come check them out, x and y are great options! Thanks!\""}
{"text":"I've been here twice and the second time was even better than the first. We shared two large pizzas - Truff-Ghi and the Italiano between four people. 
Make sure to get a reservation because there is limited seating and sometimes they do sell out of the pizzas."}
{"text":"One of the best Pizzas in the city is offered here. They have a seasonal menu which helps those who can get bored of flavors quickly and their portions are very fair. Come early though, they may run out of dough!"}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of thick crust but this was awesome.  Way better than I expected.  Not crazy thick in the middle.  Great sauce, crispy edges.  Can't wait to come back and try some different kinds (had the double pep)."}
{"text":"Doods seriously! Had the soprasetta and blew my mind! One of the best pizzas I've had since moving to Toronto from NYC 11 year's ago. I will say a bit pricey but was worth every bite. 
That spicy honey sauce is just awesome."}
{"text":"This restaurant I had been meaning to check out since I saw a write up about it when it had opened, but had just not gotten around to it. Last night that all changed, and I am very glad that I finally got a chance to enjoy this awesome local eatery!

I went with a close friend who is also a big eater (fatties 4 lyfe) so we ordered two large pizzas: the Sausage and Peppers as well as a Barese Sausage pizza they had on special. Both were absolutely flooring in terms of the flavour expanses that ebbed from them, especially in the case of the Sausage and Peppers pie. The smoked cheese complimented the peppers so fluidly, and the ranch dressing just tied everything together with a nice bow. My only qualm is that there was not enough nduja under the cheese, but that is probably because I am the type of person who eats the stuff by the handful. Prior to hearing of Descendant I had not even known that Detroit had a style of pizza, so I am not sure how exactly the food ranks in terms of authenticity, but that is almost irrelevant considering the quality. 

I am actually debating going back this weekend to try the kothu roti style pizza they have on special!"}
{"text":"Went back here and have good news.  They now serve beer.  Not only that but they have bone shaker which is a perfect, extra hoppy pairing to salty pizza.  Money!"}
{"text":"Considering the reviews for this place, I had pretty high expectations going in, and somehow it managed to exceed them. I expected a small, pretty much takeout-only style place...but the decor was really nice, and they've managed to pack in a fair number of tables in their cosy space. I would totally eat there next time! They also appeared to have a pretty decent beer selection, judging by the variety of glasses I spotted. 

I shared 2 small pizzas with my boyfriend, the pepperoni one and one with peppers, sausage, and some fancy sauces. The pepperoni one was slightly better tasting (I think less-is-more sometimes when it comes to pizza toppings), but they were honestly both delicious. I loved their thick crust with the crispy edges. My mom complained that it looked burnt, but it didn't taste burnt at all. I thought it was great. Will definitely be going back to try more varieties."}
{"text":"Truly delicious pizza.  We tried both the pepperoni and the truffghi.  Both were really good but I preferred the pepperoni.  Sometimes simpler is just better.  The pizza crust is really good but greasy.  The taste of the crust kind of reminds me of pizza hut but better.  It is kind of pricey though.  A small can feed two people if you're not super hungry.  I would definitely go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"the best pizza in town. i dream about this place!"}
{"text":"O.K!  so I live literally 3 minute walk from this new pizza place.
I was excited to find out what a Detroit pizza was all about.
I bought the large with ham and pineapple.
With tip it came to $34 for 8 fairly hefty slices.
Personally, I found it to be bad value for money and won't return.
The only thing I liked was the crust which had a Parmesan touch.
Myself and a friend ate the whole thing between us which is unusual for a large pizza.
It didn't have much pineapple or ham on it.
Personally, I think Pizzaiolo is a much better pizza."}
{"text":"Best Pizza I've had in Toronto. Moved from the Prairies a year ago. Very similar to Regina pizza."}
{"text":"We got pizza takeout from here based on yelp reviews. It definitely did not disappoint. The pizzas were moist and perfectly panfried.  

I highly recommend the Truff-ghi.  2 people even told me that this was the best panfried pizza they've ever had in their life.  The Jaffna was spicy and vegetarian.  It was also a interesting mix of flavors. However it was a bit too spicy for us.

The only things to mention is that if you do order takeout at least 45 minutes in advance. Also they do not allow you to take out alcohol. You have to drink the alcohol inside the restaurant.

Overall taste was great.  Reason for 4 stars is we paid $30 for large but that only gave 8 square slices.  We were still hungrier after.  Wish portions were bit bigger."}
{"text":"Service was pretty quick considering it was a full house!
Had the double pepperoni and some wings to go with it. It was freaking delicious. Everything had flavour to it, not the flavour of salt, cheese, and processed meats, but everything tasted as if it was tenderly prepared and well executed. There was so much love in my mouth and around it. It was hot.

A little $$$ but well worth it if you haven't had it before!

We went around 5:30pm on a Sunday and it was busy, even though tables were clearing up I could see most of the free tables had reserve signs. So call ahead so you wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"When we arrived here on Saturday evening, there was 45 min waiting. We got a table in able 30 mins... We ordered Jaffna pizza and it took a while to arrive. Only on our reminder, that they realized they have not placed the order! But they were quick on correcting their mistake and offered complimentary food and drinks. The pizza in itself was simply delicious. And very good customer service. I am planning to visit again, but probably a takeaway!"}
{"text":"Is it a tab bit hipster friendly in the east end of queen street. Yes! You will get all the fixture's necessary in order to accommodate that scene. From the rustic bench seats. To the dim lighting and craft beer. Also the cool menu with secret recipe's and creative names like Truff-Ghi for the mushroom cremini pizza or electric avenue for their jerk chicken pizza. Nice place! 

However what stands out here is the food- the dough is a nice thick crust and the topping and the way it is served is amazing. Picture worthy and tasted just as good! I went with a friend who doesnt like pineapples in their pizza and I ordered the electric avenue. He enjoyed it so much and didnt realize there was pineapples. Thats because they blend the toppings in a great way.

It was bit steep with a large pizza at $32. However it was worth it. Really delicious!"}
{"text":"I should preface my review by saying that I LOVE thin crust pizza. Then one night, I passed by a packed house at Descendant and my curiosity wore me out. What was I missing out on? What is this Detroit-style pizza and why does it look so damn tasty? Being a deep-dish newbie, I thought the pie would be greasy and excessively indulgent. I have to give them credit for slinging a pie with a satisfyingly crispy crust that is dare I say... light? 

I shared the small (8x10 in) pie with my friend and we both found it to be enough. I lament the lack of side dishes at Descendant. Usually, I am for places that do one thing and do it really well, but some sides would have been nice to enjoy a more well-rounded meal. One other small gripe: Nearly every pie on the menu has meat and is scant on vegetables. Would have really appreciated a more substantial vegetarian option."}
{"text":"Let's just say it has been a while since I've gone out to eat and given 5 stars. The time has come. 

Amaaaazing pizza. Thick delicious dough and fully covered with fresh ingredients in great flavour combos. I honestly have nothing bad to say about this place. Cool vibe, cool deco, cool music playing on the bg.

I'm glad I came with a group so could share a few pizzas. 7 of us got 3 large pizzas - sausage and pepper, truff-ghi (mushrooms and bacon), and electric avenue (jerk chicken and pineapple). All of us were so full. I think 3 larges for 8 people would have been perfect.

The first one to come out was sausage and pepper. Omg...the tomato sauce was so good. And the cheese. This one was my favourite but I'm not sure if it was my favourite because I ate it first and got progressively full after it. 

Second to come out was truff-ghi. It's a white pizza, very different flavour profile, and oh so yums. 

Then the electric avenue which had pineapples. Still good, but I was so full by this point. My least fav of the three.

As an added bonus, I tried a little piece of the Canadian cause another friend ordered it. I wasn't big on this one. 

All in all, great pizza and fun times. More fun if you come in a group and order several pizzas so you can try out more!"}
{"text":"This is easily the best pizza that I have ever had. Going in, I had no idea what Detroit style pizza is. I was guessing somewhere between a deep dish and a classic wood oven pizza - but I couldn't anticipate what I actually got. Other reviews are right about fighting over those crispy corner pieces. We ordered the pepperoni which was loaded with cheesy goodness and every inch of the pizza was covered in cute small and delicious pepperonis. We also asked for the white sauce on the side which they called their own ranch, but it was more like dill sauce. Delicious! After following their Instagram for a year, I only wish I pulled the trigger sooner."}
{"text":"What can I say other than \"AMAZING\"! The quality of this pizza is second to none. My pizza was over the top delicious. What a great spot and what an attentive staff. Thanks for caring about making great food!"}
{"text":"As of November 30, 2015 I have 24 pizza places reviewed in the following list:

http://www.yelp.com/list/pizza-toronto-11

before writing this review.  

I am very happy to say this will be my first 5* review for pizza, period.  Yes, I've been to a variety of Chicago deep dish places in the past.  Yes I've had VPN certified pizza in a variety of establishments and yes I've had NYC style pizza on Long Island. 

This place Descendant transcended my expectations for what pizza could or should be.  To me there is no real \"should be\".  Pizza may have originated in Napoli and the style and methods for making this very famous food has been made to suit the tastes and styles of whatever region it is serving.  This is true and yes while there are so many changes to how authentic Neapolitan pizza may have evolved to today this is just one but it is probably my favorite I've had to date across all variations of the food.

Pizza here at Descendant Detroit Style is different from your every day pizza and their style while not entirely something new is something that is totally reborn from your every day mundane mass produced version pizza that is as ubiquitous as the hamburger has become.

What makes Descendant's version different is the style and it's in their NAME.  Detroit style if this is what it is, is very good and I have a new love for this style of pizza.

I almost hate to use Little Caesar's as an example but I almost fear that I have to.  Now for those that aren't aware, Little Caesar's pizza is owned by the Illitch family of Detroit who also own the Tigers and Red Wings professional baseball and hockey teams.  Caesar's has come out of their Deep Deep Dish pizza which is essentially a pan pizza, square with cheese to the edges, crisped and made crunchy.  

The reason I bring up Caesar's is because for those that are familiar with that version of Detroit born pizza will understand what Descendant's Detroit Style pizza is like, but better.

Please, do not take my comparison to Caesar's Deep Deep Dish to say that Descendant's is the same. This is an apples to oranges scenario.  Descendant is far and away superior to Caesar's because yes the ingredients are better but only the style (shape, cheese crispy at the edge) is the same style.

Descendant's crust is for me the best part.  The edge of crusted cheese is my favorite part because of the crunch and the way this pan pizza is just cooked WITHOUT being a disgusting sponge of grease like Pizza Hut.  Let me be clear that this is proper sit down quality pizza completely not of the Pizza Hut/Little Caesar's variety.  This is not a chain and that is one part of this establishment's charm.

It's small inside and you can see the kitchen from the dining area because it's that tight.  The wall art and decor is of a very industrial feel to it, very blue collar, Hell's Kitchen/Meat Packing district feel to it.  Even the banister leading to the rest rooms is made of industrial pipe with end caps.  On our table we had a place to hand our jackets, purses etc at either end also made with pipes and cap ends.  This place feels like you are in an urban place to eat.

Add to the options of drinks, unique drinks both juices, pops and beers are of the local craft variety such as GLB, Amsterdam, Beau's etc.  Vernor's I believe its origins are from Michigan.

I had ordered the large (8 slice) double pepperoni and it was like heaven.  Deep crust, fresh generous melted cheese with the sauce on top sort of like Montreal style but the square shaped pieces with crunchy, crispy cheese on the edges makes it all worthwhile and that edge is the edge this style of pizza has over all others in my opinion.

I was able to have a slice of the Homenaje which included: Cheese Blend, Fresh Chorizo, Roasted Jalapenos, Lime Pickled Onions, Sauce, Cilantro Sour Cream, Fresh Cilantroil.

My wife ordered the white pizza which included:  Cheese Blend, House Ricotta, Caramelized Onions, Toasted Bread Crumbs, Lemon Dressed Arugula.

Now while I had ordered a large it's not 2 x small pizzas so if you are looking for more \"edge\" or corner pieces you'd have to order 2 smalls to get 8 corner pieces.  

The service here was great, the food was great and everything about this place to me stands out as going against the grain, coming out with something new and different from an everyday food item that just makes it that much better than every other place out there in Toronto.  For a nice twist for a food that you may be used to if you want something different I couldn't recommend Descendant any more than I do now."}
{"text":"Walked all the way from Queen West on a warm Sunday afternoon in order to sample this pie (and deserve it). Two of us shared a Gatt-Daddy (house made fennel sausage, Mama Lil's Peppers, red onion, sauce, basil aioli, fresh parsley & basil) and we were suitably impressed. It has enough toppings that the crust doesn't dominate, but the sides are crispy and a real treat. One can only describe the crust underneath as pillowy. The ingredients in this one were top notch and pretty much exactly what we imagined it would be. We wanted to start off with a pizza that had some classic flavors but seeing some of the other pie go by, I think we will be back to taste some of the more new world combos. The jerk chicken with pineapple looked particularly awesome. We have had Detroit deep dish pizza in Detroit which was a little bit different than this, but we are no experts, and this was delicious!"}
{"text":"Not sure what detroit style pizza is but this was absolutely delicious!

We came quite late with a large group on a weekday night. This spot is more on the cozy size as seats looks limited. Staff was very accommodating, and friendly. 

I tried the truff-ghi and the canadian. What stood out to me the most was the crust. Inside of the pizza was soft and the outside was a crispy crust. Flavours were amazing with tons of toppings on each slice of pizza. 

This place is amazing... excellent quality and service. Price of the pizza is reasonable especially since you can share a small pizza amongst 2 people. 

Definitely coming back as I am currently still thinking about their pizzas!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in Toronto! We came here on a Friday evening at around 8, and had one of the last pizzas as they do sell out! We waited 20 minutes to be seated for 3 people. The interior looks like a little hole-in-a-wall type shop, but very clean and homey feeling.

We tried 2 small pizzas for 3 people: the truff-ghi and a sausage and peppers. The crust was great, with nice thickness. The toppings were fresh and made every bite worth it. The truff-ghi is very heavy with the cream sauce, but the truffle taste is there! Lots of food for a small looking portion! 

Between three of us, we still brought a few slices home! A great place for great pizza in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The Sopressata is so sweet that it's almost a dessert pizza. So unless you like that I wouldn't recommend it. 

However, I'm conflicted because despite that, I still really enjoy my meal there, the pizza has a satisfying bite, and the peppers on it really put it to the top. The leftover was especially satisfying the next day."}
{"text":"THE FOOD- I'm a West-end girl but my chef friend told me this place had the best pizza he'd ever eaten so I decided it was worth a trip. My friend and I had the Jaffna, a delightful Indian veg pizza and it was absolutely delicious. We shared a small and it was just the right amount of food to feel but not stuffed. There really is something magical about this style of pizza, the crust is the perfect thickness and crispness and the cheese in it blends in perfectly. I will definitely be back with my meat loving husband to sample some of the non-veg pizzas.

THE SPACE- While it's a very small restaurant, they do a great job of making the space not feel too crammed. Lots of cool artistic touches in this place, my fav was the intricately bronze tiled ceiling.

THE SERVICE- Our server was friendly & fast. What more could you ask for!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian Review

Ordered a Vegetarian version of the soppresatta marmalade....amamzing...perfect crust and blend of flavors. 

Definitely returning!

Also try the sgt peppers minus the meat and the Jaffna!"}
{"text":"Shared the small white pizza with a friend, we were both stuffed! The food was amazing, I can't wait to come back! It's a bit overpriced, but it's definitely worth going!"}
{"text":"We loved it; purely went because of the yelp rating. The staff were very nice and attentive also. Service was fast too. Would have been a five star if I could have added mushroom to my pizza."}
{"text":"Rich and deliciously tasty pizza!  My order was a takeaway, so I can't comment on the service ;however, the room was very nice, and quite busy."}
{"text":"Had the Soppressata Marmalade. Delicious. Thick and crispy crust. Super greasy in all the right ways. Small was 4 slices- could have stopped after 2 but went for the 3rd."}
{"text":"Really great pizza! The crust is crispy around the edges and the flavor combinations are fantastic."}
{"text":"Good deep dish pizza! I placed an order via Uber Eats as I've been wanted to try this place for months but it's a bit far from where I live. I noticed that they do deliver via Uber Eats so I decided to give them a try. I ordered a small truff-ghi and small soppressata marmalade with ranch dip on the side. 

The truff-ghi pizza was surprisingly good! I usually prefer tomato sauce on my pizza but the blend of mushrooms, bacon and white truffle sauce made for a delicious blend of flavours and the lemon added a refreshing twist. But my favourite was the soppressata marmalade! I loved the combination of the saltiness from the soppressata and cheese with the sweetness from the hot honey. 

I was a bit worried about the delivery as it was over an hour wait but the pizza arrived nice and hot. This place is a bit pricy but a great treat if you are looking to indulge!"}
{"text":"Decent pizza, terrible service. Ordered a pizza and they told me to pick it up in 15 minutes. Went to the store in 20 minutes and they had me pay, wait around in the store for 10 minutes before telling me my pizza wouldn't  be ready for another 30 minutes. Ridiculous. Guy at the counter needs to sort his shit out."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon the place was busy but got a table right away. Kinda limited on space but the turnover rate is quick. 

Ordered a large double Pep and it was great! The perfect amount of meat and cheese combo and  the crust was super delicious. Would probably get takeout next time I go though. 4/5"}
{"text":"This place took a pizza my heart. If pan pizza is your kind of jam, then you have to try Descendant. There's fine selection of white sauce and tomato sauce based pies. Make sure to bring friends so you can have more than one pie!

I got two small pizzas with a friend and we had plenty leftover. I'd highly recommend the Jaffna pizza because it's something you don't see all the time and it's got fantastic layers of flavour that you wouldn't find on a traditional pizza."}
{"text":"Unbelievable pizza place. 'Pizza' doesn't really do it justice, because it's so different from the kind of pizza you're used to. 

We had 'the good old days' and the soppressata pies. The good old days was really good, standard kind of pizza taste with subtle flavours from tomatoes, onions, and cheese. Simple but delicious. 

The soppressata though was unbelievable. Oddly enough it's a sweetish taste accompanying the spiciness. Really great pie. 

The dough though, the dough is something special. If all Descendant did was bake dough and throw it in my face itd be worth it. 

Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Ordered from uber eats. Not sure why the prices on there are higher than those listed on the website. Took them 1h50m to get the pizza to the driver, plus the 20 mins to drive here, ended up waiting for 2h10m for a pizza. The pizza it's self was good. A+ on the pepperoni!! I'll have to come in next time and hopefully have a much better experience."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night.  Loved it! The best pizza I remember having in a long time. Staff were awesome as well. Great job Descendant, can't wait for my next visit!"}
{"text":"The only reason this place does not get a 5/5 from me is because the line up can get long and it takes 30 mins for your pizza to be ready. I live around the corner and that's fine because I can call it in or walk in and order then go back home to wait, but it can get pretty gnarly and sweaty in there on a busy night! Having said that the pizza is oh-sooooo-worth it. Tip: get the pepperoni or white pizza. Skip the Hawaiian. It's normally my favourite but it's just kind of weird here as other reviewers have noted."}
{"text":"great pizza (i got the pepperoni). it was full, thick and the crust was crispy. the portions were spot on. 

however there is limited seating so be prepared to wait for a table & wait for your food...we waited at least 30 mins for the pizza (they seem to give preference to take out orders)."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've ever had. This place is trendy and delicious. I've always ordered take out here. Double Pepperoni is out of this world, and the mushroom truffle pizza is a god send. It's pricey but worth it for me. I love the deep dish aspect and the melt in your mouth crust. The only drawback is that they have taken away there I aïoli dipping  sauce. Guys bring this back please."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by proof studio gallery in the distillery district. Omg was she spot on. Best deep dish I've ever had. I'm not usually a pepperoni girl. But holy crap was it deliciously amazing. Sad I don't live in the area. Otherwise I'd be here every other day. Nom."}
{"text":"So after about 4 attempts to visit this place I finally got to! Amazingly, they were open AND had food! (It was Saturday at 530 so that is no testament to them). Unfortunately, their delicious looking pizza was only marginally better than chain restaurant deep dish pizza. It's not even close to authentic Chicago deep dish (I'm not even sure what Detroit style is...little Caesar's maybe?). Oh, and they only had like 4 pizza options; a bunch of options on their menu were crossed out and unavailable...big surprise."}
{"text":"Just a quick update: I have received an apology from a co-owner. I would have appreciated it more if it came from Chris himself, but it'll have to do. I can only hope that this whole debacle doesn't happen to another customer."}
{"text":"If Descendant Pizza was closer to my house, I can say, without a doubt, that I would be here at least once a week. The pizza was so delicious!! 

I got the peppers & sausage and my friend got a white vegetarian pizza. I checked the website but I can't seem to find it (the white pizza). Even though we were both starving since we came from rock climbing, neither of us managed to finish our pizza! I took 2 slices home and so did he. The pizza came very hot and the crust was crisp. The toppings were also plentiful (don't you hate it when places are cheap with toppings?!) and the sauce just to die for. They also have a home made hot sauce that you can request as well. I brought the pizza for lunch the next day and it tasted just as good after being toasted for bit in the oven. 

Service was great! The server answered all the questions we had (I didn't know what calabrian chilis were - question: are they really spicy? answer: no) .We got there maybe a half hour before they closed and I didn't feel rushed while eating. Parking is found on the streets right outside."}
{"text":"Finally got to enjoy a meal here. The bae has been wanting to go visit for a long time and we ended up here last week.

Note : Menu is just pizza and beverages. I think they may sometimes offer feature menu items (ie not pizza) but sparingly.

It's a small and cozy space with cool artwork on the walls (the David Bowie piece above the cash is pretty rad).

We opted for the double pep and sausage and pepper small pizzas with sides of hot sauce and house made ranch.

Pizza was delicious. The crust was deliciously crunchy but not greasy at all. Loved the gooey pockets of cheese blanketing the pizza. So yum.

We will be back to try other pies hopefully soon!"}
{"text":"Ive never heard of Detroit style pizza until this place came along. 

I got the sausage and pepper pizza in the small size which comes with 4 slices. The bready base was soft and a good kind of chewy and the crispy cheese edges were the best part. However, there was barely any sausage and mostly peppers...it just tasted like spicy peppers. Looking at other people's pizza they also didnt seem like they had a lot of toppings. It also came off a bit greasy 

But the serving size is huge! After 2 slices I was so full, which is good because the other 2 slices become another meal, and when I microwaved the leftovers the whole office smelled the deliciousness that is the pizza. They also deliver which is a bonus"}
{"text":"Loved the Canadian Pie! Deep dish done right! Sooooo much better than Mickey's in Clarkson it's not even funny. Great service, atmosphere and choice in tunes! ;)"}
{"text":"Incredible pizza, and incredible service.  Had been told numerous times how good it was, but never made the time to pop in.  Decided to give it a shot after a particularly horrible life event just happened.  The waiter asked how my day was, and I told him it was horrible (and why).  Our pizza came (Soppressata Marmalade) and it was better than described.  If you're a fan of delicious crispy cheese, fresh toppings, and a little bit of heat (with sweet), then this pizza is for you.  Without prompting, our waiter said he told the owner about our day and he insisted it was on the house.  So, thank you for the kindness, and most of all, thank you for the delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Liked the small restaurant with the fantastic pizza! Good service with knowledgeable servers about beer types."}
{"text":"I love this pizza spot so much! On a Friday afternoon that I took a vacation day for, I visited CT and she took me there for lunch after telling me how good their pizzas are.  This place is tiny so if you come with a group of more than 4, it might be hard to get seated together.  Menu is very specialized, literally only pizzas and drinks.  I went with the small Double Pep which is essentially a pepperoni pizza with TONS of pepperoni.  The pizza is perfect for one person, 4 regular slices with very deep crusts!  Of course I couldn't finish it all by myself so CT was nice enough to eat some of mine with me.  I though the pizza tasted great! Pepperoni overload with very good pepperoni (where can I get those?!) and the amount of cheese on it was amazing. Pair the pizza with my favourite Boylan's cola and you have yourself a great pizza lunch!

I would definitely come back again if I am in the area or visiting CT again!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Creative dishes, great depth of flavour, and just plain awesome people.  Definitely a worthwhile experience."}
{"text":"Split a small double pepperoni pizza and was very satisfied.  The pizza is very thick with a ton of cheese. The sauce was also on top of the cheese.  It tasted amazing and didn't have to wait long for our order. The only negative was the price. For a small pizza and pop came to over $20.  This isn't my favorite pizza joint in the city but definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"So delish! Got the Mexican and Funghi small pizzas. Both were really good but I liked the Funghi better. Even the small pizzas were heavy, so we ate a couple pieces and took a couple home for some late night snacks ^.^"}
{"text":"Quite literally one of the best pizza places in Toronto period. A small pizza joint in Leslieville, that serves up Detroit style pizza with flavors from all over the world and it works! Range from Mexican pizza all the way to Sri  Lankan Roti pizza. This place has it all! The pizzas were bursting with flavor, the cheese and the sauce complimented all the topics and that crispy crust just firm enough to  hold it all together. This place still haunts my dreams!

Forewarning, this place is small and does fill up fast if you intend on dining in. The tables are small and if you're group is small enough you'll likely end up sharing a table. But it is so worth it! I can't wait until I go back for more!"}
{"text":"It was through a food TV show where I learned of such a thing as Detroit style pizza, whose two most distinctive qualities are the rectangular shape and thick deep dish crust. But that was long before Descendant brought this form closer to home. Maybe too close to my home.

Surely most Torontonians likely never had pizza like this. If I could, maybe I would eat here every day, but I'd be broke quickly. Yes, for far above $15 for even a small sized (8x10\") pizza, which is enough to feed one hungry person (it was very filling), it'd be a thick treat. No, they don't sell pie slices. But they keep their tiny menu fresh with a seasonal rotation of new and limited-time varieties.

I picked a couple of their stuff on takeout (call ahead--the pizzas take a half hour to make). Their fancy Pepperoni is juicy and unlike your average chain pizza place kind of thing. The \"Good Old Days\" was even more juicy and flavourful, with a bit of sweet tang. The puddle of tomato sauce on top, very thick dough and the crunchy crust, yeah it was really something that may make you rethink pizza in this city.

{"text":"4.5 Stars

As I bit into that first bite...the tangy tomato sauce and the ooey gooey cheese I knew I had almost reached nirvana.  I'm going to first say that I'm usually more of a thin crust kinda girl - the deep dish is usually not my go to.  But this place changed my mind.

Located on Queen St E, this small pizza place which bills itself as Detroit style pizza has more of a Kensington vibe with the faux tin ceilings, eclectic art work and paint spattered walls.   The kitchen is open so you can see the chefs working hard at making your pizza (plus you can keep an eye out if any of them are digging for gold and then smothering their hands in your dough! - and no they did not do that here...just saying you can check it out with open kitchens).  It's a small joint that does takeout but they can accommodate one large group (8-9 people) as there is one large table and a few smaller ones.

Now to the pizza.  This pizza had the sauce and basil over the cheese and this is what makes it different from other places.  I shared a large Margherita pizza with another lovely lady (about 10 square slices).   A small is about 4 square slices and plenty for one person.  Depending on the pizza a small can be about $12-13 and the large can be $20-25 so sharing one large is a good option.

To give you a visual, the pizzas here look like the Little Caesar's deep dish pizzas - that thickness and crust.  But the comparison stops there.  The flavours in this pizza are subtle - the sauce does slightly overpower it and the basil is cut up in small pieces and I prefer the whole leaf for a more impact of flavour (which is why  deducted .5 starts).  Other pizzas ordered at the table were the double pepperoni, the white pizza and I believe a pizza that had some truffle oil in it with onions (I've forgotten the name).  Everyone said theirs was delicious - as I don't eat pork I was unable to try a few of the others but I will take their word and their happy expressions as proof.   Based on others who had been here before it seems they may change up their menu on occasion as one person mentioned before they had a Hawaiian type pizza that was no longer on their menu.  This placed apparently is fairly new on the Queen St E locale but it's already made a great impression!   The chefs/owners are quite lovely and really want to make sure you enjoyed your pizza and overall experience.  As we were a larger group the chef came out to advise it may take a while longer than normal due to the amount of pizzas we had ordered - which I knew it would take a bit longer but I nonetheless appreciated him taking a moment or two to acknowledge it.

When I feel like heading over to Detroit but don't want to take the long drive there...I will just come here for the 'za!"}
{"text":"Lets be honest people.  This place is over hyped by the hipsters and millennials.   Their pizza is average at best.  The only way I can describe is it like biting into greasy plasticine with a cement burned crust.  I know the angry owner who doesn't take criticism lightly will bash this.  This is your PRIME example of how a business can be successful by PURE hype and \"hipsterization\".  And for that Chris, congrats on stealing peoples money with your overpriced rectangular loafs of dough with idiotic toppings that should never ever be labeled as a pizza. Jerk chicken, butter chicken, curry, should never ever touch a pizza crust.  And if they do, don't call it pizza anymore.
I had the double pepperoni.  It was edible.  But for the price you pay its ridiculous.
Now here is something that bothers me.  You sell out and quite often and quite early.  Even a lab rat would learn after a few times.   Maybe you should make more dough, buy more cheese etc?.  Your announcing that you sold out is just to appease the hipsters.  Its \"fake\" marketing to say look how good we are, we are so good we sold out.  Its one thing to sell out of an item like Smoked meat because smoked meat takes hours and hours to cook.  But how do you run out of cheese and sauce and toppings, dough.  And why are you so proud to announce you failed as an owner to make enough food for your demand?  You should be ashamed not proud you keep selling out."}
{"text":"Very good pizza - but selection of offered pizzas is relatively limited and relatively pricey for a pizza."}
{"text":"awesome! tasty and unique approach to an old favourite"}
{"text":"just went here a couple nights ago and had the sopressata pizza and my daughter had the pepperoni.  they were both absolutely delicious and fresh.  the dough was so airy and chewy but light at the same time.  i didnt think i'd like a deep dish pizza because if I had to choose i'd always go for a thinner slice but this didnt feel heavy.  i'm sure after they get their groove in operations, they will make a killing as they should.  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Detroit has it's on style of pizza? And it's deep dish? ok...if you say so.

I've been to Decendant's a few times, which should be indicative of what I think about the pizza there. I like everything about this place. The decor, the servers, the beer selection, and of course, the pizza!

you can't really go wrong with any of the pizzas on the menu. the toppings are all quality, and though the flavours may be muddled by the sauce, or the amount of toppings that are on it, the taste is great, and the crust is relatively light considering it's deep dish."}
{"text":"I'm the biggest fan of pizza, especially thin crust so my review might be a bit biased *WARNING*. The pizzas here are all filled with super thick and crunchy crust, not like the deep-dish Chicago style pizza (which I still have yet to gorge myself on.)

Definitely do not be expecting thin crust here. The title of the place says it all, it is absolutely \"Descendant\". 

I've been here for brunch about 3 times now (and counting!) and each time has been lovely and filling and heaven. I came with my boyfriend and we each had a small one to ourselves (i REALLY love pizza so sharing ain't for me here.)

I've tried basically all of them and below are my two faves:

TRUFF-GHI (18) - I have no clue how it's pronounced and why it's like that. BUT IT'S BEAUTY. The crust is crunchy, but not too greasy and this white thick pizza is amazing. Mushrooms, garlic, and bacon; what more can I ask for?!

SOPPRESSATA MARMALADE (18) - Sweet and savory. I would say this pizza has a lot going on, a lot of flavours jumping around but it's perfect for the morning hangover. 

I'm a total fan and wold recommend it to everyone. The only downside I have to say is it's on the pricier end, but a great place to enjoy filling pizza."}
{"text":"Wowwee! I finally got to descend on Descendant Pizza a weekend ago after returning from the Buskerfest in the neighborhood. 
I've heard about this eater from people that I've met in the city, but I couldn't find a good time never time or moment to go to a much talked about eatery. Well, that changed on Saturday night and again it was out of pure coincidence because one member of our group suggested it.
I think we came here around dinner time so the place was busy but the one guy whom I think was the supervisor took one our phone numbers and would let us know once a table was ready. So we went to a nearby pub for a drink while waiting to get notified; and sure enough one of our phones started ringing and we went back there. 
So we ended up getting two of the large sized pizzas: one was the La Cornita (the Chorizo was omitted because some of the people in our group wanted a vegetarian option) and the other was The Good Old Days. Both pizzas came out looking impressive and if anyone goes there hungry they sure can finish up a whole large pizza. Two of us shared the Good Old Days and I already felt full after going through about two and a half portions of the pizza. And it was so good. The thick crust was pretty chewy and the toppings seemed to melt into the crust with every bite. The La Cornita also looked good with a lot of the Cotija Cheese and corn gracing the other toppings. No complaints from anyone about our pizza, and both of them were polished off.
One of the best parts that I really appreciated was the supervisor, man he was like a Champ. There was a small confusion with our bills because both pizzas ended up getting divided between the six of us but after letting him know about that he nicely corrected the mistake and gave us a new bills with the respective pizzas on them. That was awesome of him!
The great tasting pizza here was a good way to satisfy our appetites after taking in the activities at the Buskerfest"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and each time this place has lived up to the hype and my expectations. Love, love their pizza! It is a smaller establishment, so make reservations to avoid disappointment."}
{"text":"This pizza is so dreamy. Electric Avenue is a perfect blend of flavours. The dough is thick but light and fluffy - everything about the food here is artful. A little expensive, I would call this high end pizza. I wish I could afford to eat this more regularly! It's blissful."}
{"text":"Very good deep dish pizza. The spicy jalapeño pizza was especially delicious. Crusts are cheesy and formidable. Very filling."}
{"text":"I've never tried Detroit-style, and was skeptical - but this popular spot has converted me.  One of the pizzas was a touch too sweet for me (I was warned that it tends to be a love it or leave it flavour for pizza), but otherwise everything I tried was delicious, the service was great and our server was charmingly enthusiastic."}
{"text":"Have only taken out from this place but every time my guests and I are wowed by the taste and quality. Amazing pizza and friendly service on the phone and in person. The nice man was patient and made recommendations to his favorite pizzas. We had the daily special, delish!!! Only wish they had more variety on their menu, eg more appetizers. Neighbourhood jem!"}
{"text":"Others have described the pizza here in great detail and fairly accurately, so I'm just going to add my personal opinion of the pizza. 

We tried the sausage and pepper pizza and my goodness, was it amazing! Definitely felt guilty eating it as I could feel the fat just seeping through my body, but definitely an indulgence worth partaking in on (rare) occasion. Loved the tiny, spicy peppers on the pizza as well, that gave the flavour a whole other dimension.

I don't foresee myself ordering from here too often, but when I do it will definitely be a guilty pleasure."}
{"text":"Descendant is a Pizza house on a mission.  Entering the front door you quickly realize why they put so much effort into their location, cause they care.

At the front counter I was greeted with a smile and quickly offered a menu to focus my attention from the mood setting decor.  After ordering my take out I was asked if I was stepping out, they also offered a seat, 18 min later a freshly made pizza was calling my name.

The crust was super crispy, packed with flavor, the kind you almost want to eat first!  The cheese topping was heavenly layered with pepperoni hidden underneath as a surprise for each bite.  The tasty pizza sauce was sitting atop the pizza, slightly odd I thought.  One taste made me realize, it was a sauce to be loved not abused by hiding away under the cheese as a thin almost forgotten coating.  I loved the pizza dough, soaking up the flavors, it was a compliment not to much & not to little!

Thank you team Descendant!

{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon, not usually a fan of thick crust pizza but this was delicious! Great service, funky decor and ordered the Sausage and Peppers, and Soppressata Marmalade (my favourite). The crust is chewy and soft and easy to share. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Yelp! Influenced my decision to come here in the first place when I found myself on the east side without much awareness of the best places. Somehow I missed the high praise in the Toronto Life (or perhaps I am so infrequently on the east side that I didn't get the memo) and other places.

Descendant is expectation-shatteringly delicious. The Gatt Daddy was the best pizza I remember eating.  It will be very difficult for any other pizza (or pizza place) to pass muster after this.

Service here is also excellent. In a town that has a boat load of average service (and restaurants), Descendant's staff rocks. The servers seemed eager to please without being patronizing. Everyone I encountered here was supremely professional.

I can't wait to eat here again. Five stars all day long."}
{"text":"Came in around 7:45 pm saw a grand total of 6 people inside and a couple empty tables, were immediately seated and 5 mins later ordered a small Good Ol' Days and a couple of sodas. Drinks came immediately and 35 minutes later our pizza was served. I'm from NYC so 35 minutes for a pizza is unforgivable, but maybe it's normal in Toronto. But if the pizza is worth the wait, who cares?

Well, the dough is springy with a satisfyingly crispy crunch, especially around the edges. The ingredients were fresh. The roasted red peppers were visible, the tomato sauce was bright and tart, the fennel sausage made an appearance minus the fennel, the grana padano was grated on top along w/ the red onion and dollops of basil aioli added that same creaminess you get from ranch dipping sauce. All-in-all it wasn't worth the wait. All I tasted was bright, tart sauce and occasional tangy basil cream. The sausage, when I happened upon a piece, was occasionally fatty and flavorless which I found odd. On a positive note, it was filling enough for two hungry, but not starving adults.

Tl;dr - it's expensive, tastes ok, not memorable, and we waited long enough that it'd be free if it was Domino's. It does taste better than Domino's though, so there you go."}
{"text":"I could not believe I could get such amazing deep dish pizza here in Toronto! Super delicious, really cool space with great artwork and the server was super friendly!! Definitely will come back for both takeout and to dine in!!"}
{"text":"On the pricier side and not something you'd eat everyday but well worth trying Detroit style pizza. Much thicker dough than your usual pizza, generous toppings, you won't having a boring bite."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. We got two small pizzas, one sausage and peppers and the other was a white pie with mushrooms. Both had extremely delicious, crispy crusts and the perfect amount of toppings. I'll be dreaming about it for weeks."}
{"text":"Tried this place last night for the first. I'm not a super pizza lover but this pizza was the very best I've had in a long time.  We will definitely make the drive from Mississauga to Leslieville soon!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out on Good Friday. It was my first visit. The waitress was nice and recommended a few items. Waited 20 minutes for a small pizza. It was quite delicious and would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I'll keep this short & sweet - easily my favourite pizza in Toronto. Crispy on the outside, soft & fluffy on the inside. I tried 3 different varieties of the pizza (Double Pep, Sopressata Marmalade & the White Pizza) and they all more than exceeded expectations. I'd recommend the Sopressata Marmalade if you're looking for something a bit different than your traditional pizza flavours - it's sweet with a bit of a kick - I am definitely a fan of the hot honey!

To top it all off, the service was just as fantastic as the pizza was! Super friendly, super helpful, and super quick!

Price point is good too (shared 3 small pizzas & drinks for about $12 each with 6 people. We also got a free large by luck, and still had pizza left over)

If you haven't checked this place out yet, you are missing out! Plan a trip here soon! I know I will be back :)."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place when I walked past it. I was thinking what is detroit style pizza - I got to try this! 

So we ordered a couple of pizza for lunch thinking we would have at least 5 people eating it and one pizza would be too small... well, it wind up be bigger than we thought. 

Mind you - two pizzas basically costed $60. Was it worth the cost??? Not really, maybe it was cause we got take out and should have eaten in, as the pizza was a bit soggy (even though it only took us 15 mins to get home). It would have been much better crispy.

We had ordered a pepperoni pizza and the truffle pizza. The pepperoni one was a bit salty and you definitely need to wash it down with lots of water. The truffle one was different and it had lemon zest on it which made it interesting. They only issue I had was that it didn't have much truffle taste to it."}
{"text":"We ordered the Truff-Guy and Sausage & Peppers pizzas. Unfortunately, when they brought it out we realized they had gotten our order wrong and gave us the Electric Avenue instead of the Sausage & Peppers. We let the server know and he was very apologetic, said he'd put in the right order and we can keep the extra if we wanted. It would take an additional 15min, but we were happy to try the extra pizza and to wait for the correct order. 

TOTALLY worth it. All 3 pizzas were delicious, but our favourite was definitely the Sausage & Peppers, as it had a nice kick to it. If you like spicy, their diablo hot sauce is really good too with a touch of herbs. It will cost an extra $1.50, but it is definitely worth it. The crust is also cooked to perfection. The crust is baked twice which is what makes the cooking time longer, but it gives the outer crust a nice crunch while leaving the inner crust super soft. 

When they brought out the bill, they only charged us for the 1 pizza for the mixup! We offered to pay for another pizza and they wouldn't accept it (don't worry, we tipped them nicely for their awesome service). Amazing customer service, super friendly staff, casual atmosphere. It is a bit on the smaller side so call in to book or expect a wait (they can call back so you can explore Leslieville while you wait). The space is small but the flavour and serving size is big, so bring your appetite! I will definitely be going back, and would recommend anyone else to try it!"}

{"text":"This is quite possibly one of the best and undoubtedly my most favorite of the pizza places in the city.

Right on to the pizza: being a typical Indo non-vegetarian, I could try only two pizza variants; Electric Avenue (chicken) and Jaffna (an instant favorite). The pizzas were drool-worthy and just melted in the mouth. The inside of the pizzas were soft with a crispy crust on the outside - the toppings, specifically on Jaffna, were absolutely fabulous (mango chutney and cilantro cream do make a distinct combination). The portions were more than adequate - my wife and I could share one small pizza. Large pizza meant getting a doggy bag for later. 

Cold/re-heated pizza: in order to ascertain the quality of pizza, I do look at \"how the pizza tastes when it's cold\". This pizza passed the test (with flying colors) and tasted wonderful either cold or  re-heated. 

In the past one month and a bit, I have been to this place as many as 6 times and I loved the experience everytime I was there. The staff has been uber friendly and courteous.

I would definitely go back for more. But, it would be terrific if we could have chicken/veg options available for other menu items. 

Given how wonderful the pizzas are and the limited options (chicken + veg) that I have, I give this restaurant a well-deserved 4.5 (more a 5 than a 4 on Yelp scale)."}
{"text":"Honestly this is one of the best pizzas I've ever had in Toronto. You've got to come hungry and be prepared to wait. It's worth it. The pizza is thick and hearty.. Not for those who prefer a thin crust. It's flavorful and there are lots of choices to satisfy any pizza lover. Good solid choice of beers. Seating is communal."}
{"text":"Very pricey but great pizza. It gets really busy and very popular with the locals. I would come here when i get a raise at my job since i cant afford such richness on a regular basis. If price was a little better definate 5 stars"}
{"text":"The food was really great; however, the seated service was okay - not intentional but they just seemed to be slightly all over the place. There's limited seating and it's HOT in the summer with doors closed and the ovens running. If you're going in the summer and it's nice weather, try pick up and eat your pizza in the park a few minutes away."}
{"text":"Was in the area and happened to fire up Yelp for dinner, and boy am I'm glad this place popped up!

The pizzas are a thicker style and visually intimidating, but the dough is actually fluffy and lighter than it looks so it doesn't overstuff you too much. Two of us shared a small soppressata marmalade and a small sweet corn pizza, and we had two slices leftover to bring home.

For a new restaurant, it doesn't seem to have too many teething issues, which was something I was scared of since I had a horrible experience at Mr Ciao on Gerrard. The food came in a timely fashion, and service was friendly. I will definitely be coming back for more!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza's in the city. One hungry day walking in the queen Street area I was seeking a new restaurant to try. I then came across this wonderful pizza joint. When looking at the menu I was very confused and overwhelmed. The staff was very friendly and patient to answer questions and recommend pizzas based on your preferences. I decided to get the truff-ghi pizza. Very awesome choice most like their other options. Descadent is more on the pricerier side but it's well worth every dollar!"}
{"text":"FINALLY - pizza that's delicious, not overly greasy and worth the money! I can't believe I didn't try this place sooner! Believe the hype - there's a reason why it has a near perfect rating on Yelp.

We ordered the small size for both pizzas (8x10) since we wanted to try two different kinds. Also it was our first time ordering here, so we weren't sure if we would love the flavour combinations and we wanted to spend a bit less - $21 for a small pizza already seemed a bit steep.

I don't know how \"authentic\" this pizza is but I don't care - it was so good!
We tried the Electric Avenue pizza, which we were curious about since it seemed like more of a unique flavour. It had bits of jerk chicken, pineapples pieces, green onions, peppers, some hot sauce and curried lime aioli. It had a great combination of flavours that blended well together with bites that alternated between sweet, some tang and dashes of spice. 

We also tried the Sausage and Peppers pizza, which had smoked cheese, nduja sausage, peppers, chilis and hot ranch sauce. Another good choice because it was savoury with a bit of heat in there - again, great flavours but probably a bit more \"safe\" and what we'd normally order compared to the Electric Avenue pizza. I also have to comment on how crispy and airy the crust was - a great complement to the flavours on the pizzas themselves!

To sum it up, we're fans of this place and we'll definitely come back to try the other pizzas when we're in the area again. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Thick pizza?! Yes please!!! Every person I've recommended or taken this place to has really enjoyed. I don't think you can go wrong with any pizza you order."}
{"text":"Wowzers! Smart, smart little place in Leslieville. The venue is quite small but the pizza experience is XXL! I am more familiar with Chicago style deep dish and was anticipating the typical round 2\" deep, weighs as much as a bowling ball pizza pie but after tasting the Descendant Detroit style, rectangular shaped, tastes like Angels laughing in your mouth pie I am a convert. The square or rectangle shape comes from the original use of industrial trays found in Detroit factories to hold small parts and I must say that crispy golden squares of this divine pizza is much easier to wield than the floppy triangle sections of a traditional round one. 

My sweetie is a pizza gourmand and will \"prime\" his stomach and palate by eating very little on the day he is to try a new place and fretted that the smaller 8x10 size wasn't likely to fill the void but was greatly surprised to find that it was the perfectest choice (don't laugh, Shakespeare used \"perfectest\" in several sonnets and got away with it!) and was completely satisfied. 

We were with 2 other friends so got to sample 4 pies in total, each one as good as the last!
Bravo Chef Getchell!"}
{"text":"Man, I'm eating well in Toronto this week!  I'm not usually so generous with 5 star reviews, but thanks to Yelp I'm being steered to some great places. Today's lunch was a white truffle sauced bacon and mushroom pizza at Descendant. 

I've had NY style, Chicago, Sicilian and now Detroit, and love them all.  Strange things can be so different, still all be pizza, and all still be so good. 

I'd read someone call their \"Jaffna pizza\" the best thing they eaten this year, but it wasn't on the menu today (server said it used to be permanent, and was returning next week - I might too!). 

Cozy venue good for very small groups, safest for couples. Parking in the area is a little tight, but I found free 1hr parking on the side street a block east - cha-ching!

I was also a fan of the $1.50 vernors (in keeping with the Detroit vibe), a fair price and no gouge. Bottles of Boylans pop were also available for $2.50. So although the pizza is pricey, a small easily feeds 2 and with a couple of pips you're out the door under $30 - not bad."}
{"text":"The Soppressata Marmalade pizza is dangerously delicious. The style of the pizza, with its soft heavenly crust and crispy sides would be delicious with any toppings but the Soppressata Marmalade is the perfect combination of flavours. Saltiness from the cheese and Soppressata, which marries well with the sweetness from the honey, which in turn marries well with the spice from the peppers, etc. The basil tops it all off by giving it some freshness.

Chicago deep dish pizza? Forget about it! There is way better and super delicious Detroit style pizza right here for the taking. Nom Nom Nom."}
{"text":"The lowdown:  It's rectangular shaped, non-Pizza Hut greasy, medium dish, pizza with good ingredients.  Crust is crispy around the edges and rest was a fluffy, focaccia-like consistency.  That's it.

Pizza was good, but it didn't blow my socks off.  I accidentally ordered a 'White Pizza' (no tomato sauce) which normally I wouldn't have ordered because I prefer the traditional tomato sauce.  However, it was good if you like mushrooms and caramelized onions.  Did seem to taste even better the next day!

Small 'white' pizza was $16 and I was only able to eat half, the rest was takeout.  Wished they had an option of ordering a smaller, less expensive portion, so you can try different kinds if you're not dining with a group.

Btw, the only veg pizza was Margherita for all you vegetarians.  Most meat options were pork, although staff did say that there were able to remove toppings that you didn't want.

Staff was nice, although I felt like they were hovering as there were at least 2-3 waiters for this tiny restaurant.  I was asked how everything was 3Xs during my 30-45min stay.  Felt like they were either very green or fishing for compliments.

Tip:  Better experience if you dine in a large, at least 3-4 person, group so you can try different pizzas.  UNLESS you're a huge pizza eater which I'm not."}
{"text":"GREAT PIZZA. 

This might be my favourite place for pizza in Toronto. I had the Soppressata Marmalade as takeout and I thought it was amazing. It was sweet and a bit spicy, just a great combination of flavours. 

You need to come here to try their pizza! I promise they will not disappoint."}
{"text":"Couldn't wait to write this review after having their pizza! I was never a big pizza fan, especially when most non-franchise pizzas are sold at Italian restautants in Toronto, and I'm not an Italian lover. I learned that there's this detroit style pizza spot in leslieville but was not convinced it was worth a visit until I saw the pictures! It reminded me of the deep dish pizzas I had in Chicago.

We called in advance and they mentioned that they were able to reserve a table at the bar for us, but we decided to do take out. The place is small, with a few seats for parties of 2, a tiny bar area that fit no more than 5 people, and a relatively larger table for a small-medium size party, about 6-8 people. We were told that the pizza will be ready in 30 minutes, so it is a longer wait compared to an average take out place. So if you're thinking of doing take out, call ahead instead of coming here to order and wait. 

We got The Mexican and Electric Avenue. The Mexican didn't taste too much like Mexican food. Not sure why I expected to taste like an enchiladas, but it didn't. It was more of an \"ingredients Mexican food likes to use\" type of pizza. I loved the sauce drizzled on top of the pizza with a slight dab of sour cream. The Electric Avenue was also a hit. I am for pineapples on pizza, and EA takes hawaiian pizzas to the next level. It is slightly spicy.

I loved the crust - wasn't sure if they had cheese in the crust but it tasted like toasted dry/crusty cheese, yum!! One thing I dislike about the \"traditional\" Italian style pizza is the tomato paste. I don't like my pizza tasting like tomatoes, overpowering the cheese and the ingredients. Pizza here, you barely taste the tomato paste, it's just there as a complement to the other ingredients.

This is probably the best pizza I've had, loved the ingredients they use, the crust, and the flavour combos! I can't wait to try more of their pizzas."}
{"text":"The best pizza I have ever had, although it is pricey, it's well worth the price, can't wait until they add single slices to the menu!"}
{"text":"Never heard of or tried \"Detroit style pizza\" before I came here. Its thick but not super cheesy like Chicago style pizza. Had both the double pep and the Sopressata Marmalade. Both were very good, but the double pep has a slight edge. The sopressata was a bit sweet for me, and I usually really like the balance of sweet and savory foods. Overall a great place and service was attentive as well."}
{"text":"I didn't even know what Detroit Style Pizza means, so we we've ordered 2 large ones for take out for the group of 4 and it was  definitely an overkill. These are not the pizzas in the usual sense. They are more like home made pies with lots of tasty stuffing. And it took them only 20 min to prepare them. I'll definitely order from this place next time when I'm really hungry."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the first time I found it to be very good but the second time was pretty poor. The bread the second time was very chewy. I also got the pepperoni the second for the first time and really wasn't a fan for the meat"}
{"text":"Super amazinggggggg!! I would definitely come back again even though it was a little out of the way to get here. Went with some good friends and had a wonderful evening. Reservations had to be made as there was limited space. 

I ordered the small White Pie (Cheese Blend, House Ricotta, Caramelized Onions, Toasted Bread Crumbs, Lemon Dressed Arugula). It had four slices and was delicious, but I thought the double pepperoni was even more AMAZING. It was to die for ! LOVED the crunchy crust. I wish we could just eat and eat and eat without feeling full!

Staff was amazing and came by to check on us. The chef also apologized as they were behind with orders in the kitchen. But I didn't feel it took long at all. Highly recommended! When we were here I noticed there were a lot of orders for takeout...Now you know why. Super delish and best pizza in the city!"}
{"text":"Very good to excellent pizza most of the time. I have eaten here three times and turned away once because they ran out of dough. When the crust is cooked to perfection the pizza is exceptional, but that is not always the case.  Very good ingredients.

Note it is a very small space is it is often difficult to get seating.  

The biggest frustration has been the fact that they run out of dough almost every day.  I understand the time involved to make this kind of dough... but it is the heart of  their business. 

The pizza is excellent, but the business will need to find more consistency if it is going to survive in the long run."}
{"text":"You know the drill - a friend had mentioned this place in the fall and fast forward decided to finally make the trek and try it out. Drove over an hour return from our place in the West end - worth it!  Who doesn't love Detroit?

I love wood fired, thin crust and this is a really tasty alternative. I always think the quality of the sauce tells a lot about the pizza. The tomato sauce is among the best I've ever tasted. Fresh, bursting w tomato flavour and well seasoned. Nicely done. 

We had both the pepperoni and the Truff-Ghi. I loved the pepperoni the most. Light crust with perfect crispness. Loads of lovely melted cheese and an embarrassing amount of pepperoni.   The Truff-Ghi had nice flavours, top notch ingredients, lovely lemon smell - but found it a bit too complex and \"sweet\" (for lack of a better word)

Will be back for more - looking forward to trying spicy versions."}
{"text":"Chris makes some food that is mind blowing. When the rest of Canada is all fussed about VPN pizzas, this restaurant showed up on the scene like a Mongol hoard to wage war on your tastebuds and reign supreme over fussy purists who think only Italy can make good food.

If you haven't been here yet, you should consider it a pilgrimage. It'll change your life."}
{"text":"The best pizzas in Toronto hands down!  I am sick of the annoying flat bread pizzas and Descendant is not like this.  Their crust is delicious and the flavors are very unique.  They also change up their menu once in awhile so you always have new options to choose from.  They are located in Leslieville.  Wish they had more locations because Leslieville is not my neck of the woods and it's a trek to get there."}
{"text":"This just might be my favourite pizza place in Toronto. 
This pizza has a great crispy crust, thick, light and filling. The sauce is fresh and packed with taste. They cook the pepperoni to perfection. I always order the double pepperoni. 
I have always taken the pizza out so I can't speak for the staff but the environment is trendy in a small room."}
{"text":"Found this little gem from BlogTO and of course after checking out the many positive reviews from Yelp, wanted to check this place out definitely after a long day of work! This place is far from downtown, east of Queen St E and DV but easy to find parking. A small restaurant, sits at most 24 people in either 2-seats tables or one large 6-seats table. We saw a lot of people do take-out on a Sunday night, so definitely popular for the area. The open kitchen and dark and eclectic decor makes it seem like a young hip restaurant. 

We got greeted by a young eager guy who was able to describe the sizes of the pieces--which come in either small or large. We ended up ordering the small White Pie ($16) and small Sweet Corn Pie ($16). I was hoping for the Hawaiian but they seem to not have that tonight. 

I don't know whether or not it was because I was tired from work or we were both really hungry, but I felt our two small pizzas took way too long to arrive at our table. Maybe 20 minutes? I was going to give this place the benefit of the doubt but in my opinion, pizza shouldn't take that long to cook, especially in an extremely hot pizza oven, which averages 450-500 deg F, but the customers beside us that arrived after we finished our pizzas seemed to get their pizzas in under 10 min. Maybe they were busy with take-out orders? 

The pies were definitely tasty and flavourful but not the best ones I've had due to a few flaws.  The crust is for sure original--thick and super crispy with cheese. The inner part of the pie was very doughy and some may even say undercooked but I actually like doughy pies so not a problem for me. The Sweet Corn Pie had corn beschamel sauce, loads of cheese, smoked bacon and some sweet chilis on top. Overall a good flavour combination but I was expecting an intense sweet corn flavour, especially from the beschamel. Most of what I could taste is cream and cheese (from the beschamel), and little bits of corn and chilis every other bite. I'd suggest to the chefs to try and get more corn flavour in there. I mean if you are advertising Corn, I'd better be getting lots of corn flavour! 

I liked the White Pie better. Loads of mozzarella  and ricotta cheese, well done carmelized onions and arugula on top. This is the first pie I thought that was too much stringy cheese but with the sweet carmelized onions and the bitter sharp argula on top, I liked this balance in flavours. But again, the inside part of the pie dough was undercooked. The crust was done the same, crispy, cheesy and very greasy.  

They offered us a free Italian chocolate pudding. Super sweet, creamy, rich chocolate with salt on top. The salt really made it. A very nice dessert. 

One annoyance I have to mention. I noticed other tables were getting a bottle of some hot sauce. When I asked a server about it, he said it was their signature honey hot sauce. So I asked if I could try it. He squeezed some into a small container instead of bringing the entire bottle.  I didn't say anything because he brought it as we were finishing our last two pieces of pie but how rude, can't even bother bringing us the entire bottle. What, you think I'm going to eat it all or steal it home? This left a bitter taste in my mouth in terms of their service. Both servers try hard to be nice but I felt service was lacking and did not match up to the food. Perhaps I'll just get take out next time and not leave tip for dine-in."}
{"text":"My new favourite pizza! I've never had Detroit style before and the crust was amazing! We shared the Sopresetta and the corn pizza and they were both totally unique and delicious.  The service was fast, attentive and gave great recommendations. I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious pizza! This super popular small pizzeria serves Detroit-style pizzas with great toppings! The menu is on the small side but the pizza here is totally awesome.

What's a Detroit-style pizza? Think of it as a cross between Chicago-style and your regular crust pizzas. To be complete honest, it reminds me of the crust on Pizza Hut's pizzas - but I mean this in a complete good way, because I absolutely adore the taste, the airy texture and the flavourful crust with a satisfying crunch bottom.

Being popular, expect a wait at regular meal times. It took us 40 minutes to get a table, and around 25 minutes more to wait for our order. I was to the point of hangry during the wait, but after the first bite all was forgiven - it was worth waiting for!

What we got: The Barese pizza (a daily special) - Barese sausage with vokda sauce, pickled peppers, pecorino romano and fresh parsley. Simply delicious!

Overall, highly recommended and a must-try for pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto! The dough for their pizzas is perfectly crispy and fluffy at the same time and it's just absolute heaven! I have tried a variety of their pizzas, but my all time favourites would have to be the Our Canadian and Truff-Ghi pizzas. They will often have different specials that aren't listed on the regular menu, but you cannot go wrong with the Canadian and Truff-Ghi. The portions are big and it's a heavy meal, so a small can be enough for 2 people, but I always get two pizzas so I can have leftovers. Heating the leftovers in the oven the next day and the pizza still tastes amazing. If I could only have one meal for the rest of my life it would be descendant pizza!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious thick crust, pan style pizza. We ordered the Truff-ghi (mushroom) and the 'Taliano (sausage), and neither pizza disappointed. The crust was crispy and buttery, the truffle sauce on the mushroom pizza was aromatic and flavourful, and I loved the freshness of the tomato sauce on the 'Taliano - it really complimented the flavours of the fennel sausage on the pizza. This last pizza was a bit on the salty side, but that's not really a problem when we're talking pizzas.

 

In the end, I wish the place was bigger, I wish it was closer to me, I wish the menu was more varied. But I will gladly make the trek back to eat there again and again. Yummers!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I had arranged for 7 of my friends and I to meet here on a Thursday evening, but I got stuck working late, so I could not make it. I asked for their feedback the next day, and most of them loved it. Some even said that it was the best pizza they have ever had. So naturally, after hearing this, I knew that I had to get my butt here ASAP. So when I finally made it here, and tried the pizza, my first thought was, \"huh? Am I missing something here? Don't get all the fuss.\" 

I realize that I probably set some ridiculous expectations, and that I am being unfair. But my experience felt like I was eating a fancier version of Pizza Hut pizza, that was twice as expensive. 

I know my review is harsh, but I want to point out that I am in the minority. Most of the people that I know that have been here love the pizza. I am just more of a Chicago deep dish and Neopolitan pizza lover."}
{"text":"DP is amazing.  My son and I go here (on average) once a week.  He is 8 and a picky eater and this is the only pizza he loves!  We either dine in or take out.  I've never had bad service.  The owner and staff are tremendously wonderful, polite, sweet, and honest.  I've read all of the reviews on here and for those who said that the crust was burnt - are you serious?  It's crusty and never burnt.  I used to go to Queen Marg once a month and they always BURNT the crust.  For those who said the staff was disorganized...do you not have \"those kind of days?\"  They are a very busy new business so sh*t happens - get over it.  For the one that said they ran out of dough at 730 three times in a row...that just goes to show you that they are the best and crazy busy.  I know it's not ideal and if you had offered a kind complaint I am sure he owners would have compensated you next time.  When things are that good - they sell out fast.  Leslieville needed a great pizza place with an uncomplicated menu and healthy and trustworthy ingredients and we got it - finally!!!!  I'm Italian and we make our own dough and sauce but I've stopped and we go here instead.  Thanks Chris and chefs and Andrew - we heart you all!!  xx"}
{"text":"I've always been a thin crust kind of person but there is no denying that Descendant is pretty good.

For 2 people, a small is more than enough. If we had gotten a medium, there would've for sure been leftovers.

We tried the Truff-Ghi which was rich in flavour and the lemon zest was a nice touch.

The restaurant itself is small and there's not too much seating so not great for large groups. While we were there for lunch, there were a lot of take out orders and deliveries.

Good lunch spot - I'll be back to try the other toppings!"}
{"text":"After receiving hate mail based on my negative review, I am downgrading my rating to 1 star.

I was going to give them a second chance because maybe the issue was that I did take out, but now?  No way.

Everybody has their own preferences, and if I thought the crust was burnt and hard to the point of being almost inedible, and that the lower pepperoni tasted disgusting they can't handle that criticism?

Won't be back!  Saved $60 that I can spend at Libretto or Queen Margherita instead!  Yay!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night after reading raving yelp reviews and seeing drool-worthy pictures of the pizzas. The pizzas and the service failed to deliver. 

Don't get me wrong. The staff was really nice and apologized multiple times for the delay in seating us. The restaurant was busy, busy when we stepped in. We didn't get seated until much, much later. My date had to ask for his stool twice. Service failed but at least they recognized that and apologized. 

As for the pizzas, we got Double Pep and Sweet, Sweet Corn. 
They were okay. I guess I'm not a big fan of such pizza; not as mind blowing as some reviews say it is. I'm glad that I got to try the Detroit style pizza, though, so I know what to expect next time I'm ordering it."}
{"text":"Amazing quality food with great service. Order the larger portion of pizza as the left overs are great next day."}
{"text":"We're in from Michigan do had to try their Detroit style pizza. It's expensive but the toppings and execution are worth it. You get pizza like this in Michigan that has slightly better because it's crispier but still if I was living in Toronto I would be getting pizza from here all the time to satisfy my craving for Detroit style pizza. 

Love that this is a thing in Toronto. I hope they do well and stay open so I can try more of their pizzas next time I come back."}
{"text":"4.5 stars... arguably one of the best pizzas I've had in Canada.  Why not perfect 5? I just came back from Italy and I have a soft spot for VPN types.  If I ever crave pan pizza, this is the only place I would go back to in Toronto.  

I think everyone has a childhood pizza that they remember fondly... you know the ones.  Either it's frozen McCain pizza, flat cardboard 241, or my childhood greasy crunchy Pizza Hut.  Descendant Pizza takes my pizza childhood memories and perfects it to what only Pizza Hut could dream of being.  Yeah... its that good.  So Detroit style is a rectangle pan bubbly dough pizza (apparently shape & size matters) with a baked cheesy crust and the toppings are all reversed.  The cheese is on top of the dough and then sauce on top...  yup, backwards to what we all know.  

This place is PACKED so call in for rez or plan to do take out.  And they do tons of take out!  I think in the hour and a bit we sat here, we saw 20+ take out orders.  If you're looking to do a big group, 4 people might be ok unless you're wiling to buy out the whole place.  The place is small but it makes up for it in the very cool rock aesthetic.  Service here is friendly and pretty quick.  Pizzas are made quickly so you're never waiting too long to dig into a great slice.

Before I dive into the reviews... I'll talk about the size.  There are 2 sizes and even the small (4 slices) is generous for a regular person.  I could finish 2 slices for dinner... 2.5 slices if I'm starving and a complete glutton.  If you're sharing the large pizza, it comes with 8 slices.  Be ready to fight for those corner pieces because they're the best... the most crusty baked cheese on top of crunchy delicious bread.  If you dont think that's the best piece... I dont think we can be friends.

Jaffna pizza (vegetarian) - Descendent just put all other vegetarian pizza on notice. You can eat vegetarian and not sacrifice flavour.  I'm used to vegetarian pizza being boring or the same... tomato, cheese (vegan at times), and basil.  Throw some limp mushrooms or peppers and call it a day.  This one is not boring at all... taking inspiration from South Asia, mango chutney with cherry chilis, sambol, green onions, cilantro cream, and fresh cilantro meld together to give you a completely unique taste that keeps you wanting more.  5/5

Sausage & Peppers - bringing the heat and meat is the mantra of this pizza.  Smokey cheese combined with a a lot of chillis (house made tobasco ranch sauce and 3 types of chillis) plus spicy sausage Nduja makes for a really good savoury meaty bite.  It's one of their newer pizza and if you like heat... this would be a great one to get.  4.5/5

I know they change their menu often and they often show their new items on instagram.  I was hoping to see if they had their soft serve creations still available but it seems that it was done by the time I got here in September.  Overall, great spot for very good pizza... get a rez and just come hungry and you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time eating Detroit style pizza and it was so delicious - totally worth the trek to Leslieville! Came on a weeknight and made a reservation for 5 since it was a small space - our group took up a third of the seats. We shared two large pizzas ($30 x 2) and it was just the right amount. They were made to order so there was a bit of a wait, but they were flavourful without feeling too rich and the crust was a nice balance of crispy vs chewy. The Truff-Ghi was creamy and earthy, and the Soppressata Marmalade was next level good. It was an unexpected, winning combo of sweet and savoury ingredients. 

3 pieces was enough to be reasonably stuffed and this was a great meal for a cold night. They didn't have double doors so it got pretty chilly near the front - had my jacket on the whole time. Service was nice and efficient. Would definitely come back again, especially for the Soppressata Marmalde!"}
{"text":"This is handsdown the best thick pan style pizza in the city! Toppings are premium and super flavourful. I have ordered several times and it is always consistent. Wish they delivered to a further area since I didnt have to drive to pick up but its worth it!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious. I also enjoyed the unique beer pairing. The restaurant is small and very cosy. Perfect place if you are trying to have a nice dinner without a lot of noise. But the thing I enjoyed the most was the staff. He was very friendly, patient and very accommodating. We were slightly cold and without hesitation he increased the heat."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. This Detroit-style of pizza is unreal - Toronto's first joint but hopefully not the last. Such a refreshing take on pizza. You would think that the bread would be a bit much given that it's thick crust but it's very airy and supports the toppings nicely. 

We had the truff-ghi which is a mushroom pizza and a double pepperoni. The truff-ghi pizza was perfectly executed. The white truffle sauce goes well with the garlic mushrooms and smoked bacon. The double pepperoni was supposed to be the safe bet while the mushroom pizza was the adventure. Glad to say that the adventure was a success. Double pepperoni was solid too. 

It's a tiny restaurant so go when it's not busy. Check google for that. We went on a Sunday evening and it was packed. We were about to get take out but we got lucky and got seats. Ideally you want to eat it fresh so try to dine in if possible."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food and service. Tried the Italian and Canadian... both were good with lots of flavour. Attentive and accommodating service. Looking forward to going back! 
Take out service available."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza hands down. Great job guys! The pizza has the right amount of cheese and exploding with flavors. The spicy sausage pizza was delicious and had these little tomatoes that would pop with juice in your mouth. The aioli pizza had good flavors. I don't normally like ranch sauce I liked the ranch sauce here!"}
{"text":"First day of opening and the place is packed for dine in and take out.

The staff are super friendly and they made a mistake of boxing our pizzas to go. After finding out, one of the pizza chef was quick to apologize, and plated and served our pizza.

We ordered the Hawaiian, and Soppressata Marmalade pizza and they both came out piping hot! 

The Hawaiian was really nice with the thin slices of sweet pineapples balanced with the saltiness of the nduja sausage, and the tang from the pickled jalapeño and red onions. I will definitely order it again. The crust is to die for, crispy cheese melted onto the crust, and with a settle chewiness of the dough.

My husband had their Soppressata Marmalade and he loved the chili honey that was on the pizza; gives it a sweet kick. Overall he loved his pie and would order it again.

We anticipate that Descendant will be packed once the good words are spread.

Good job guys!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came to Descendant Detroit Style Pizza on multiple recommendations from my coworkers, of which some have stated it is the best pizza experience available in Toronto. At the time of this writing, I can't say I disagree. Descendant's are the best pan/square deep-dish pizzas I've had.

The shop resembles a ghetto/run-down living room with a pattern-tiled ceiling and muted wallpaper with paint marks, various artwork equally covered in marks/paint, clean wooden tables and bar stools, and two-tiered bar seating at the windows---a very interesting vibe.

Their menu features several composed combinations of toppings for pies available in small and large (8x10\", 10x14\" respectively). For two people I recommend one large. We ordered two larges with the intent of doggy-bagging for tomorrow. They also have a good selection of soda, ciders, and beers. 

We ordered an off-menu feature recommended by our server, the Berese, and the Electric Avenue, which from the sounds of the description seems to be a twist on the Hawaiian. After a considerable but still reasonable wait, out came two very handsome rectangular pies. From the golden caramelized cheese crusts, across the rich toppings, to the topmost shredded cheese and ripped herbs and drizzle, they were a sight that compelled me to dive in without thought of possibly obliterating the roof of my mouth. The crust has a pleasingly substantial chew and the crispy edges made me covet the corner pieces as one would for a pan of brownies. The vodka sauce of the Berese was delicious and paired perfectly with what seem to be a fennel and lamb mince or sausage. The Electric Avenue featuring jerk chicken and pineapple was a match made in heaven for my girlfriend, temporarily causing her to forget her hate for green onions. We wolfed down as much as the physical constraints of our stomachs allowed, and packed the rest for home.

Needless to say, we look forward to coming back for future seasonal/off-menu creations. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to a night out with my boy and some Detroit style pizza. We walked in and it was fairly busy but there still there was a table for 4 so my two boys and I sat down. It took ten minutes till I had to ask for menus for them to tell me that the tables reserved. They were no signs stating or telling the customer that it was reserved, so other table was freeing up and was told that,that tables was also reserved. I was told that there was no more small pizza only large pizza left and if I order now a table might free up because it takes a while. It felt that the local business that everyone wants to support didn't want my business. The service staff didn't make feel wanted or comfortable to stay and wait for that large pizza"}
{"text":"Never had \"Detroit-style\" pizza before, but I'm sure glad I tried it. In my ongoing quest to find decent and authentic deep-dish pan pizza in GTA area, it was suggested we try Descendant, which prepares it's crust in kind of a hybrid deep-dish and traditional American style manner.

The decor was interesting, and as a friend I was with commented, it kind of felt like some kind of an underground club or something - faux bronze ceiling tiles, and reclaimed piping for furniture was a nice stylistic touch. It's not the biggest place though, and a big cramped, so perhaps call ahead. 

I had a chance to take a peek at some of the other options, but being the meat-eater I am, I had to go with the \"Double Pep\" - their regular pepperoni pizza with twice the amount of pepperoni (brilliant, I know!). This will definitely not disappoint, for anybody that enjoys the style of pizza with a crispy buttery crust framing the thick cheesy goodness. Crushed tomatoes on top of the cheese was nice.

Admittedly, I did hope for a bit more pepperoni for the additional charge, but it was good enough. A \"small\" at this place will be enough for most, but if you're really hungry you can go \"large,\" which is basically twice the size of the small.

This place just opened a few months back, and it's already picked up steam. Definitely worth checking out if you like this style of pizza."}
{"text":"Decent.  Worth a try if you're in the mood for deep dish.  It is a bit greasy on the crispy bottom .... Like pizza hut.  Which is great when you're in the mood for it.
My only complaint was light on the meat toppings."}
{"text":"Came here on a date night with hubby.  Nice cool little spot in Leslieville with a great vibe.  Our server was super helpful and recommended the Soppressata (spelling?) and we were or disappointed at all it had the perfect blend of flavours- and tasted truly unique from anything I've tried before. The crust was thick and doughy with burnt cheese on the edges so yummy. Highly recommend this low key place. They also had a great selection of drinks and beer. We had Vernors which was priced very reasonably.  All in all a good spot if you are looking for just pizza and beer with friends. Not good for large groups but good for a casual date nightie just hanging with a few friends."}
{"text":"Descendant Detroit Style Pizza is definitely my favourite pizza joint in town. I've become well acquainted with the staff here, who genuinely wish for their guests to have a positive experience and a delicious meal to go with it. 

For a newer pizzeria, they've worked hard to perfect many aspects of this young establishment, not excluding the menu and the flavours of each item. The chef/owner in charge of this place definitely puts his passion on display and listens to feedback, as I've experienced first hand. I've brought many a guest to dine here and they all have nothing but good things to say about the 'za.

Must-try items:
Soppressata Marmalade
Truff-ghi (Mushroom & cremini pizza)
Homenaje
Double Pepperoni
Sergeant Peppers
It's Not Good, It's Grape (not on menu)

I've had every pie they offer (and even a few creations that aren't regular menu items), so I consider myself enough of an expert to say that they make killer pizzas here. Not everyone is going to love this place, as I've realized, but that's okay. Can't please everybody. Don't let that stop you from trying them out, though. They've got a nice selection of beer, cider, and wine, the odd dessert surprise, and a nice view of Leslieville. 

It's always crowded here, but well worth the wait if you ask me. Over and above all other reasons, it's the pleasant and friendly service and unpretentious atmosphere that I enjoy most about coming here. I'll be a loyal customer so long as they remain in business. Shout out to all past and present members of the Descendant crew."}
{"text":"This place's pizza is awesome. They know what they do well and they stick to it, which I appreciate. My bf and I went for the first time and ordered a large Truff-Ghi to share, which was more than enough for the 2 of us. So glad we had leftovers for the next day! 
Yes, the pizza takes a while to make but hey, perfection doesn't come easy. It was absolutely delicious. I'm typically a fan of thin crust pizza, my boyfriend likes Chicago style deep dish, and we decided that this was a wonderful compromise for both. I loved the crust of the Detroit style - crispy yet airy. So perfect. The toppings seemed like they would be a little heavy but they actually balanced each other out quite well, especially with that lemony zing to cut through some of the richness. It should be obvious but if you aren't a fan of mushrooms, I wouldn't recommend the Truff-Ghi - there are a LOT of mushrooms. 
Definitely would go back, even would order in. I don't live in the neighbourhood of the restaurant but I'm happy to see it as an option on UberEats! We were deciding between the Truff-Ghi and the Electric Avenue (jerk chicken, pineapple), so I think I'd try the latter next time. Yuuum!"}
{"text":"Short story: top 5 greatest pizza I have ever had!

Visited on a windy Friday afternoon. Not too many people, but excited to try my first Detroit style pizza. The server was not exactly charming, but was friendly and attentive. Two of us split the large... we should have split the small.

Inventive and delicious toppings and combinations. A real gem."}
{"text":"This place is rad. Low key vibe, delicious pizza. Unique flavours and high quality ingredients. You'll leave full and happy. Service is great too!"}
{"text":"Descendant is a Detroit style pizza parlor. My friend who lives in the area recommended it as one of the better pizza places in the area. They have about 7-8 Detroit style pizzas, ranging from classics to more novel pies. I think coming here with a group of people is preferred. They only sell whole pizzas, the small being 8x10 (cm?) the large being 10x14 or something. Portions are fairly large, as they are deep dish pizzas - I couldn't finish a small by myself; it's very filling. The pizzas seemed excellently crafted. Would come back here if I was very hunger and wanted very filling square pies.

Venue is relatively small, seating maybe 20 people; it's very hipster looking with colorful morbid art. I ate in because I came early, but I hear there can be multihour waits for take out. Service was very friendly; cooking time ~15m.

Ordered:
GATT daddy Fennel Sausage - my preference. Onion, red sauce, sausage, basil aioli
Truffleghi - Carmel onions, mushrooms, heavy creamy truffle white sauce"}
{"text":"All aboard the Yelp hype machine. The pizza here is good, not mind-blowing. You'll like it if you like pizza hut. It's thick and extra greasy. The difference here is that the pizza is square and hard-crusted, which is pretty neat and a plus. They also have a few specialty pizzas that other mainstream pizza spots don't have like a creamy sweet corn pizza, which I enjoyed much more than their \"double pep\" pizza. The inside is trendy and fit for hipsters. You pay quite the premium for all this compared to other pizza places... you can get a large specialty pizza at most other places for the price of a small one here. Personally, I don't think it's worth it once you're past the initial novelty of detroit-style pizza. 

The service here was pretty disorganized, albeit friendly. The pizza took very long to come out. Also, when we got there the waiter led me and my date to the end of a shared table to eat. There was a missing stool for some reason so I asked for a stool and he, having a jug of water in his hand, said he'd get the water for the other table first and then get me the stool, but then he quickly changed his mind and told me he'd get the stool first so I wouldn't be standing around. Good idea I thought. He disappeared and I stood around waiting for a few minutes while looking at the menu. I then noticed he had come back to give the other table their water and was chatting them up. After he was done he walked past me to do other things and I had to bug him for a stool again and he appeared to have completely forgotten about me. Off he went again to find a stool and finally I was seated. It was just a bit odd since the place is very small, and I stuck out like a sore thumb standing at the end of a group table.  

It's a new operation though so I'm sure they'll step it up, but for now I'd suggest getting takeout rather than eating in to avoid a bad experience."}
{"text":"I don't get it. It was like a really thick slice of Pizza Hut pizza. Mostly doe and way over priced. It's described as almost Chicago style but a true deep dish has deep fillings. Their pizza is more of a pizza cake where the toppings act like the icing on top. I even paid for the extra toppings and it was a huge let down.
If you like over priced greasy pizza I say go for it. Almost everybody else I know who has gone in Leslieville has said the same thing."}
{"text":"Small ,quaint ,great staff and AMAZING pizza  I must say I was hesitant as I'm not one for anything deep dish as I associate it with it being way too doughy but you have to try it , I'm a convert ! The crispy crust and airy inside to my amazement was not heavy and tasted like I've gone to heaven . I could have easily had a large to myself , ok maybe not but its that good. No need to say more you just have to check this place out."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. 

Don't be wooed by all the fancy alternative  pizzas. Pepperoni is all that's needed and you're good to go. Fork and knife pizza at its best without the lingering negative after effects common after consuming Chicago deep dish. 

My only issue with this place is they need to have normal pops. Boylans is garbage and needs to go away. Gimme a good ole diet coke or coke zero (I prefer zero for the record)."}
{"text":"The place is the bomb!! Really like their pizza. It is a bit on the pricy & greasy side but that's what you get when u want specialty pizza!!! 
It is definitely more of a hipsters hang out which is cool and I think Andrew the front staff is cool!! 
I have recommended it to friends and family and suggest they go when I don't so that they don't run out on pies before I place my order"}
{"text":"It's cold, it's Sunday and it's snowing. Might as well post a delicious pizza to cheer you up.

This is the new \"Taliano\" pizza from @descendant_pizza . It has tomato sauce, cheese, basil, housemade fennel sausage, calabrian chilis, and grana padano.

Descendant Pizza is a local restaurant in the Leslieville area, which supports local businesses by using meat & ingredients sold from neighboring vendors.

One thing that also caught our eye was the impressive wall art that they had. Drop by Descendant Pizza to enjoy not just the Taliano but also their Truff-Ghi (wish I had taken a picture of that but we decided just to eat it).

One of the top pizza restaurants in the GTA!!!"}
{"text":"Still love this place but was really disappointed when we returned this Sunday and were highly anticipating their \"Good Old Days\" pizza and found it was no longer on the menu!!!! Please please please bring it back FOR GOOD! It should be a permanent pizza on the menu!!!! It is the best!  Please bring it back."}
{"text":"Initially wanted to come here on a Saturday night, but called in and found out the wait would be over 90 minutes for takeout. Instead, came in on a Sunday for lunch and there was no wait! For lunch, a small pizza was plenty of food for one. 

I really liked that the crust edges are taller and keep all the toppings from sliding around. Crust itself was extremely crispy and all the fresh ingredients went so well together. 

I ordered the truff ghi which was a white pizza that was awfully rich. Friend ordered the Gatt Daddy, which was a more traditional tomato base pizza that was a nice counterbalance to the truff ghi. 

Each small pizza comes in 4 pieces. They cut the inside, but leave the crust intact for you to pull apart. 

Wasn't able to finish an entire small by myself, but the leftovers were still good a few hours later! 

I highly recommend this place especially with more ppl to try different pizzas."}
{"text":"Must try if you're a pizza fan!

This pizza was the best of both flavour and textures. If you're into a crispy crust with a chewy centre then you have to try the pizza here. 

I came here with family, 8 adults and 2 kids and we shared 3 large pizzas and a small one for the kids. We got the pepperoni, sausage pepper, mushroom truffle and the soppressata. All were really good but the overall favourite was the sausage pepper. The soppressata is a must try though because of the combination of the salty bacon and the sweet marmalade!

The vibe was nice, you'd think a place like that wouldn't be very accommodating to young kids (4, 6) but it definitely had a good comfortable feel. 

So glad they brought Detroit style pizza to Toronto!"}
{"text":"Hey Girl. I know what you're thinking, but this place lives up to the hype and just wants to make you feel good. Plus this pie is a feminist.* 

I don't live east, and I rarely make it out that way, so it took me a while to bite into this thick beauty. My good pal Kent P brought me their famous Soppressata Marmalade, and though I'll prob go for something more salty and less sweet next time, I recognize a perfect pizza when I bite into one.

*No idea if this pie or this establishment would identify as feminist, but most things I love this dearly are feminist, so I'm making an educated guess."}
{"text":"Like most, I've had a LOT of pizza in my time, but I don't think I've EVER had pizza this good! I was recently in Chicago eating the best deep-dish in the city, and I remember thinking \"This is amazing, but it's not Descendants\".

They caramelize their crust with cheese, so you'll ever leave it till last. The double pepperoni's my favourite, but everything's really good. I'm a pretty big guy and can't eat a full large to myself, but I recommend getting a lot so you can eat it again later. Unlike most pizza, it tastes just as good heated up again (oven).

Decent beer selection if you're going to eat in, staff are super friendly. Thanks guys!!!"}
{"text":"Seriously good pizza. Thicker crust but not overly doughy. Toppings are top-notch regardless of what you get."}
{"text":"I walked by here one day and saw that people were saying good things so I gave it a shot but oh my goodness! This is the BEST pizza I've had in the city if not ever.

I've only had the Truf-guy pizza which isn't on the online menu but when I call in, they always offer it. Crispy crust, great cheese blend with bacon and an insanely flavorful truffle sauce. 

After having it for the first time, I kept thinking about this damn pizza and came back a few days later. I want to try a few others off their menu but I'm worried I'll regret not getting my usual. The small pizza is perfect for two, which comes with four thick slices. This place is the legit.

The prices are a little high but totally worth it. I've paid similar prices for average pizzas and they don't even come close to this place. Seriously give it a try- I hope they don't close down cause I'll be probably coming here once a month now..."}
{"text":"happy 700th review to me! 
was very happy to be able to come and check out this place on my vacation recently, and I am happy to say I don't have a negative thing to say about this pizza shop. the service is top notch, the food is great and extremely flavorful. the atmosphere is very comforting and mellow. I cannot say enough good things about this place, this pizzeria is something everyone should try, and it makes me wish I lived on the east end. 
parking is on the street if you can find it, and the transit options are streetcars 501,502, and 503. 

honestly come out and try this place, amazing flavors and service for the price!"}
{"text":"It's been decided. The best pizza joint in Toronto resides in Leslieville. If you don't usually venture to the East End, Descendant is well worth the trek. Yes, it's better than North of Brooklyn and Pizzeria Libretto. No, you won't be disappointed. And please don't compare this to Pizza Hut. 

It's the only place in the city that serves deep dish Detroit style pizza and does it with considerable flair. 

We tried the popular Soppressata Marmalade. This large, sweet and savoury masterpiece incorporates mozzarella, smoked caciocavallo, and basil. Drizzle it with a bit of honey mixed with chili oil and you're biting into a pie that is at once dense, delicious, and filled with flavors that I can only describe as complex. 

There is a wait since they make their pies from scratch but I would definitely go back to try their other creations. Maybe the Truff-ghi?"}
{"text":"Great pizza!! Had the pepperoni and the truff-ghi ones. The crust is very good, thick, crispy and soft. They are tasty with a lot of flavors. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food ****1/2
Service ****
Ambiance **1/2
(Out of 5)

Delicious delicious pizza!   Although the owners and any true Detroit pizza loyalist would cringe when I say this, think of it in the same family as Chicago deep-dish, only square and with a lot more crunch from baked cheese.  

We had a few different types in order of awesomeness: Good old days, Double Pepp and Truff-ghi.  I'd order any of them again however Good Old Days definitely stood out as the winner.  

We had a party of 5 guys who came with a good appetite.  We ordered 3 larges and each took a slice home.  

Highly recommended pizza.  We will definitely be going back!

Ps.  If you go during winter don't sit near the door. They don't have a double door to prevent drafts."}
