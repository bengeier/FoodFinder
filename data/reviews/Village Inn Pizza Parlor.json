{"text":"Definitely not impressed. This is our 2nd order as we wanted to give them a second chance.  I'm sure it's much better when you eat there,  but our takeout was not good.  Cheese not melted completely and sliding off of the crust from the ridiculous amount of sauce.  Pizza was not cut.  Bottom was burned.  Just not worth the 32 dollars we paid for 2 medium 1 topping pizzas."}
{"text":"I haven't had village inn pizza in 18yrs and they are still doing it right!!! Walked in and they made all the pizzas we wanted hot and fresh. Love this new location and will def. be back drove 25 mins to get there and it was well worth it!! Staff is extra friendly and nice makes you feel like your home with family!"}
{"text":"So I wish I had caught the guy's name that greeted us at the door and checked on us during our meal . Actually everyone that was working today on Sunday afternoon should be recognized. The customer service was amazing, the food was more than excellent , and the prices were reasonable. This was our first time here , and it is now the place I will go to for Pizza!! You are now my fav... If I could give you more stars I would. The salad bar was awesome and everything was so good. If I could give more than five stars I would. If you are torn on where to go for Pizza, Go go go go ! The buffet is reasonable and included spaghetti, amazing soup,salad, bread, pizza, and dessert!!!!"}
{"text":"Went yesterday with a co-worker.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  They kept the buffet stocked, but most of the pizzas had burnt (burned? lol) crust and there wasn't much of a variety.   I don't expect gourmet pizza from a buffet, so I will probably give them another shot."}
{"text":"I'm going to rate Village Pizza on two different aspects of their business: the buffet and their pizza to go.  Their pizza to go is delicious! On the recommendation of a friend, we had ordered and picked up a Supreme and Pepperoni for our lunch at work. I am a fan of thin crust (which is all they offer) and was really pleased with the quality. They were very generous with the toppings and the crust was crispy. Definite 4 star pizza.  Naturally, when the same friend invited us out to experience the buffet, I agreed and we set out on a Thursday evening. My first impression was how clean it was in the restaurant. Even the buffet was free of dropped pizza toppings, etc. The salad bar was ok. Nothing to write home about but most buffets don't have spectacular salad toppings. But the pizza...ugh. Not nearly the quality if you get it to go. And potentially the worst part was that, after sitting on the buffet for 5 minutes, it would be room temperature. I quickly understood why there was a mad dash every time the server put out a new pizza. Perhaps some heating lamps? A disappointing 2 star buffet.  My suggestion: if you are just looking to get as full as possible, the buffet will work. But, if you are looking for quality pizza, call ahead and take it to go."}
{"text":"New Store and they are doing it right.  Village Inn Pizza is a regional chain which originated in Statesville back in the '60'.  Whiie you can order specific pizza's most popular item is the pizza buffet although they generally have a very good salad bar and fresh pasta.  With one exception, I have generally found the restaurants to be very good and a great value.  The Cornelius Store is the latest addition and it moved into the old Bellacino's spot down from Food Lion in the old Central Park of town.  Walked in today and they could not have been nicer. The manager came over and stated that if I did not see what I wanted on the buffet, to let him know and he would make a pie for me. No reason to do that because the buffet was full with a variety of pizzas and I tried a little of about six different ones and did not find one I did not like.  Staff kept coming by to see if there was anything that I wanted or needed and they did this to all of the patrons in the restaurant.  They have got the Service aspect down right, the food is good and the value is definately there. Nice clean dining experience.  Only thing that could be better is the WiFi connection.  WiFi connects immediately to the router but hangs on the permission screen and keeps you from logging on. They admited the system was counter intuitive and will address it down the road which based on my experience, I'm sure they will"}
{"text":"Wednesday night is wing night.   I rated a four based on the wings and salad bar.  The wings looked to be fried then run through the grill (I think).  They were cooked perfectly.  The wings are larger than your average wings you get at a sports bar.   They are crispy and tender, I cannot say enough about these wings.  100% totally surprising me, as I am a wing snob.  The sauce is on the side, so I went with traditional buffalo.  They have other choices....  The salad bar had a great variety.  Looked fresh, actually looked better than some nasty Golden  Corrals I have been too......  The chicken noodle soup looked homemade, but I couldn't swear to it.  The noodle are wide, it was tasty.    So, Village Inn Pizza - that name.......... Pizza?   It is a solid 3 star.  Nothing special, a little below average.   It is ALL thin crust, so if you like hand tossed or traditional, you are out of luck.    It is worth mentioning the buffet was kept extremely clean, the place was full, which ensured a great turn over of food, but sometimes with a full crowd ---  the feeding frenzy leaves crap all over the bar.  The staff is friendly and works hard.   The bathrooms are clean.     To sum it up, for $9.99, you cannot go wrong, do not expect NY pizza, but you get your belly full.  Furthermore, CiCi's has better pizza for cheaper, but there isn't any remotely close.  (Exit 23 closed :-()"}
{"text":"A family member recommended this place for a casual/chill dinner one night. Of course I always check Yelp reviews so I was a little skeptical. It's nothing fancy and we all chose the buffet which includes a variety of pizzas, a salad bar, spaghetti and a few dessert options. They have tables and booths available, fountain drinks, water, sweet and unsweetened tea. You order upon walking in, receive your empty drink cup and if you choose buffet you help yourself. I grabbed two slices of cheese pizza, not the best, not the worst I've ever had. The salad bar was solid though. It came with all sorts of options, pasta salad, mini corn, jalapeno cheese cubes, banana peppers and all sorts of other fun stuff. The ranch and bleu cheese were amazing and I was told those dressings are homemade. Yum! Overall, 3 stars but 5 stars for the salad bar!"}
{"text":"Impromptu stop for lunch with small kids. Pizza, salad,  homemade soup and spaghetti on the buffet. Total win for our family. Pizza was thin and crispy.  Salad toppings were fresh and lots of choice. Banana pudding and chocolate pudding for dessert.  Several new pizzas came out shortly after we arrived.  Pretty busy for a Saturday lunch. Priced right too."}
{"text":"I'm not at all a pizza snob (I even eat the cheap frozen ones without complaint!) but their pizza really is terrible... the three stars is for the salad bar which is absolutely fantastic and fresh with so many options!"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza. I was so excited when I found out a Cornelius location had opened up. Great service!"}
{"text":"Your average neighborhood pizza joint. Great for kids, or, if you're not a pizza snob like me, great for families. They have a buffet, and the service is very friendly. The place is also kept spotless, which is a big plus.   The negative is that the pizza isn't that great. Not bad, but not great. And the Italian food is simplistic. For example, you won't say, \"They have amazing sauce.\"   A lot will depend on your pizza standards. If you're not a pizza freak, check it out."}
