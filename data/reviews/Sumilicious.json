{"text":"I've tried their Smoked Meat poutine and their sandwich. It was really filling and worth the price! For the price too it is definitely worth trying as it was pleasant to eat. I'm glad that it's within walking distance of where I live because I can see myself coming back here again and again! I would recommend the Smoked Meat Poutine for anyone coming by!"}
{"text":"Yes.  The meat was fatty and not salty.  It's a take out set up, so if possible, order to enjoy at home. So happy there's good smoked meat close to home!"}
{"text":"Saw the new restaurant so dropped in. Didn't know I was 49th of 50th to get a free smoked meat sandwich. Lucky me lol. Very friendly workers and bad ass sandwich. I'm not a huge fan of smoked meat, but I know a good product when I see it. Want to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Owners were very nice and social. The food was uber delicious. Lots of seats. Will be back again !"}
{"text":"Wow.  If you like smoked meat sandwiches, you owe it to yourself to make the trip to this amazing sandwich shop.  

There is nothing better then scarfing down a mountain of succulent, juicy and amazingly seasoned Montreal smoked meat, with just the right amount of fat.

It's piled between two slices of soft rye, perfect of sopping up all those delicious leftover juices.

Couple that with some hand-cut, well seasoned fries, vinegary coleslaw and crisp and briny house made pickles, and you have what you would call a perfect lunch.  Wash it down with an ice cold soda for extra points.

Save the trip to Schwartz's; it's right around the corner."}
{"text":"Was just here today and it was one d*mn fine sandwich.

They are not officially open yet; grand opening in is a week. So they are still in the soft opening stage.  The menu is short and simple, but don't let that deter you from what is some of the best meat I have ever had. I walked in, not knowing what to expect.  My experience with Montreal smoked meat is limited (frozen stuff) so consider me a new initiate.  

The owners, seeing that I didn't know what to order, gave me a sample of the meat. Cut just thin enough (1-2mm thick), with just a line of fat attached, the meat was incredibly flavourful and tender.  Just melts in the mouth with little effort. The juices fill the mouth, the spices tickling my nose, enticing me further.  In mere seconds, I was hooked, and needed more.

Thus, I ordered a sandwich.  The meat was piled high; more than an inch thick of meat between two slices of rye, plus a healthy squirt of mustard.  I relished the flavour and aroma, the chew, and light amount of fat.  In fact, next time, I'll see if I can get some of the fattier end; its that flavourful, and I just don't care about my waistline. The bread though, could have been better.  Suggestion to owners: contract a local bakery for good rye bread. There are a few of them around the area (really!)

The sandwich alone came in at 8.99+tax (so 10.15). Personally, I think it is priced a dollar, and a bit, too much for the area. Too many Chinese, Indian, and Hakka joints around. So I hope they lower the prices a little, or sweeten the deal with a free drink or the like. That said, I would definitely come again!

After ordering the sandwich, I had spotted smoked meat poutine on the menu. It would have been too much for one meal, but I know exactly what to get the next time I come around.  

Keep up the good job!  Hope you can sweeten the deal a little bit to keep me coming more often!!!"}
{"text":"The meat here is delicious. We ordered the pound meat and the meat poutine.

The pound meat was very tender and it came with sliced bread. I enjoyed it but I think that they should have more toppings available for the bread.

The poutine was amazing! They were very liberal with the gravy and cheese. It comes with a lot! The meat went nicely with it. I will surely be going back for that poutine! 

Overall, a good experience!"}
{"text":"By far the best smoked meat in town!  The fresh cut fries were on point!  However, the gravy that was on the poutine needed to be hotter.  Definitely be coming back here often to get my smoked meat fix.  No need to head to Montreal anymore!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend, so I decided to check this place out. Sure didn't disappoint! I had the smoked meat sandwich (extra fatty) with the cherry Cola. The meat in the sandwhich was super juicy and tender, and full of smoked meat flavour. After finishing the sandwhich I ordered an extra pound of smoked to go!
No need to make the trek to Montreal anymore!"}
{"text":"We read about this restaurant on the Chowhound Toronto website.  We drove from Steeles & Bathurst and we thought it was well worth the drive.  The owners/staff are very helpful and wanting to please.  The menu is quite basic, with not a whole lot of options.  But, we came for the smoked meat, which was delicious.  We ordered a small plate of smoked meat, which came with 5 slices of rye bread, and a small container of coleslaw.  We also ordered a pickle.  The amount of meat easily made two substantial sandwiches.  We will definitely be back with friends.  We wish the owner much success!"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend took me here
I never had smoked meat before or it was never memorable 
We got the smoked meat sandwich to share and it was pretty good. It was tender and moist and flavourful. We devoured it in 5 minutes. 
I would definitely come back here again 

The staff was nice and asked me how everything was 
Overall, 5 stars because of this experience, I will give smoke meats a chance."}
{"text":"Just like Montreal! Being a deli connoisseur, born and raised in Montreal's West coast, east side. And being of the Jewish persuasion, I know Deli! Went there today, and enjoyed a huge smoked meat sandwich on rye with a karnatzel (all beef pepperoni) on the side. The smoked meat was tender and moist. Hand sliced and fresh rye bread drenched in mustard. It was almost too hard to tame... but I managed. Would've been nice to get the sandwich on a foam plate instead of the waxed paper. It leaked a bit on the table and ripped because I was going hot and heavy on that masterpiece. I used to live in the Bathurst Street area, so I had Wolfies Deli, Katz's Deli, Pancer's Deli and the Pickle Barrel. But now I'm in Markham, so it is great to have a place to go to close to McCowan and Steeles. The owner is from Montreal too, with years of experience with Schwartz's. A must go place if you like Jewish style deli. Family owned and operated. Oh yeah by the way, the poutine looked good there too... maybe next time! Shalom!"}
{"text":"No need to line up at Schwarts
Great tasting smoked meat, moist and tender. 
I asked for fatty side and it was a winner.
We also had the smoked meat poutine-it was a big portion for 8.99, so worth it.
Get the large plate, 2 people to share more than enough meat.
Coleslaw was good too, loved it.
Great value for the portion and taste of food.
Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Not as good as Katz Deli but definitely the best smoked meat you can get around this neighbourhood!

This family-run business just opened up at the corner of Steeles/Middlefield and is serving up classic slabs of delicious smoked meat with mustard, sandwiched between two slices of rye bread.

At $10 for a sandwich, the portions are pretty big so don't underestimate it! One sandwich will definitely fill ya up if you're an average eater.

The owners were very warm and welcoming and I'd gladly come back in the future for my smoked meat fix."}
{"text":"Yum's the word!

Yelped this place and popped by tonight around 8pm. Open till 9pm, this place seems to have a steady stream of customers.
Ordered the large box of smoked meat to go. I was told the large box makes 2 sandwiches. Bread was packed separately. 

I personally prefer the fatty cut which is exactly what I got. Meat was tender and juicy. I felt that adding mustard was a must. The meat alone was not as peppery as I would have liked it to be.

I'd definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Craving statisfied, we finally have a smoked meat deli style restaurant at the border of the Markham and Scarborough area. I will just keep this one brief.

Food: Tried the smoked meat sandwich and also the smoked meat poutine and I can say with confidence that it's worth every cent. Although it's not anything mind blowing, what you have here is good Montreal stlye deli food that I can compare to Swartz. 

Service: You have nice staff that are friendly and welcoming. Basically all you can ask for. 

Recommendation: Hard to say no as this place is a really nice dine in or takeout joint. So if you were craving this style of food or just on the go for something quick. I say you should stop by here."}
{"text":"I'm pleased to welcome SumiLicious to our neighbourhood giving us yet even more variety without having to step too far away from home. 

I was looking for a quick lunch the other day and noticed *SMOKED MEAT* while scrolling thru Yelp. Immediately I drove over and ordered a small platter of smoked meat.

The owners/employees were all very nice and appreciated all the business that walked thru the door given that they're still in soft opening stage 

The smoked meat was very tender and melts in your mouth for the most part :), I agree with others that the beard is a little underwhelming in comparison to the quality of the meat. One more thing I want to add is that they only have regular yellow mustard, while eating smoked meat I do enjoy the spicy mustard that they have at other places.

Will come back as it's close to home and pretty good, especially to fill that smoked meat craving, I still rather go down to wolfies but this place is a lotttttt closer"}
{"text":"Sumilicious is just jucilicious. 
I went there after reading a highly respected food critic's review.
And it was worth travelling about 60 KM . 
My palate fell in love at first bite. Never had smoked sandwich so good in TO. And the taste is enhanced by the welcome that one receives from the chef, partner, and staff, 
4 stars for now as I have not tried everything. 
Will be going there again!
For many, there is an additional bonus: It is Halal ."}
{"text":"I actually travelled to this mall to visit another place but they were not open so I gave this place a try. 

I ordered the Smoked Meat Combo.  Please note: Not every combo includes a drink. 

The sandwich was packed full with Montreal Smoked meat.  The sandwich itself was tasty and no where near a salty other places are.  However, you may wish to ask for extra l mustard on the side.  I found my to go order lacking some mustard. 

The combo includes French fries.  These were not my cuppa tea.  I like crisp Golden brown.  These were a little over cooked.  The side salad was a green coleslaw. The portion was a little too small especially given the limited amount of fries. There was also a wrapped pickle.  The issue was it was over powered with garlic.  Not date night food.  

The service was prompt and people courtesy.  But I might give this place a pass in favour of another place."}
{"text":"Really good smoked meat sandwich. Good portions. Also it's halal. I'll definitely be coming here."}
{"text":"Amazing. Must go. $10 a sandwich after tax. They are extremely generous with the meat. You won't be disappointed. Also, plenty of seating available."}
{"text":"The moment you walk in you are greeted by the owners.  They are warm and friendly.  We ordered the smoked meat combo and smoked meat poutine and let me tell you...it was amazing! And the best part is that we don't have to go to all the way Montreal.  This is our new go-to spot."}
{"text":"The best of Montreal smoked meat comes to Toronto! Friendly people, genuine smiles, delicious and tender meat. Takeout, dine out... Make it happen. Just get the meat plate. Do it. 

It's MELT IN YOUR MOUTH tender. They marinate the meat for TEN DAYS!!! TEN DAYS. That's 240 hours. That meat spent more time marinating than you did studying for your final exams. Goodness, that piece of meat spent more time marinating than you spent *procrastinating* for your final exams.

It is ridiculously, unreal, flavourful. The kind of food you do a double take at as it just softly crumbles in a wave of fresh flavour tenderness into your taste buds, basically melding heaven and earth for a second.

Oy.

They haven't finalized their menu for the grand opening yet, but I got the meat plate for $15.50. And yes, it was worth it.

I don't even want to write this review because it means more people will know about it, and this is one of those places that part of you wants to keep a secret so you never have to line up.

Except that's not spirited Yelping... So here you are. You're welcome.

You ever line up or see a line up at Schwartz Deli in Montreal? Yeah, it's like Black Friday and you're wondering if it's even worth it. But you line up. And you wait. And you wait. And you order. And yes, it is worth it. Schwartz is every bit the tourist attraction in Montreal.

EXCEPT NOW IT'S RIGHT HERE IN NORTH SCARBOROUGH. The owners of this spot used to work at Schwartz - the very same - and have now brought their talents to the 416.

I wasn't paid for this review but I would actually agree to work for them in a heartbeat if they paid me in sandwiches. I need to find nutritional information on this because if it's going to be so close to my workplace, I'm going to need to know the consequences of eating here weekly. 

Fast Facts:
*The bread isn't that special. It's the meat. The bread was a bit dry. 
*It's a deli spot - not many options for vegetarians. Saw french fries on the menu though.
*Halal options here - just ask"}
{"text":"Great smokemeats tasted like Montreal.  Stop going to other big chain deli places and come here.  Will visit again."}
{"text":"Beat smoked meat around with very very tender meat, but not quite smokey enough. The rye bread needs to be a bit chewier too. Nice guys"}
{"text":"I came here a few times already ordering the large meats plate.  It isn't cheap but you get what you pay for

My brother came to visit from Hong Kong and I got smoked meats and poutine for him to try and he loved it.  He asked me to go back the following day to get more for him.  

It goes to show how good this place is."}
{"text":"Don't bother driving 5 hours to Montreal - this is the real deal. Probably the best smoked meat in TO.  Be sure to specify what cut (fattiness) of meat you want."}
{"text":"Great smoke meat. Friendly and very helpful. They really know how to make a sandwich just enough mustard the mixture of fat and lean meat is balanced outstanding.The only thing I would say is fries need a little work not crispy. Thanks for a great meal"}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of sandwiches so got the chicken poutine. Sounds like such an average meal but oh man, the chicken was sooo good! Maybe it was the seasoning on it, or just the way it was cooked, but I'm usually pretty picky when it comes to meat, but this was just awesome!! Would definitely get again! Price was reasonably cheap ($8.50) for the giant portion.

If you're into sandwiches, they looked pretty good too! Stacked with so much meat on the inside I don't even know how people bite into it, but I heard the Smoked meat is pretty good! Also pro-tip, you can get the meat in either Lean, Medium, or Fatty. Haven't tried it, but heard Fatty was the best!

Worth checking out and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This joint is a good place to be if you're craving smoked meat but don't want to drive all the way to Montreal. The owner worked at Schwartz in Montreal for 15 years before uprooting to Scarborough, Ontario. The meat is tender, and flavour is pretty good. I will say.... depending on your preference, this place is not as salty as Schwartz."}
{"text":"Best smoked meat in the city...and I live next to st Lawrence market. True MONTREAL smoked meat. Worth the drive from downtown. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The portions here are huuuge. I love this place and the workers are so friendly! It seems like it's family run, which is something that always keeps me going back to a place."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Ordered a smoked meat sandwich, and smoked meat poutine. Smoked meat was super tender and delicious and poutine portion was huge. Closest thing to Schwartz without the 5 hour drive."}
{"text":"Closest to  original Montreal smoked meat in Ontario that I have encountered! Highly recommended. I also tried the smoke duck (need special order) as take out and it was a hit at dinner! There was not one price left.  Cannot wait to try the smoked chicken and smoked turkey."}
{"text":"I really like Montreal smoked meat sandwich and was wondering if this place is legit.

After I had their sandwich I can honesty say that it is legit and very juicy. I recommend it to everyone who likes Montreal smoked meat. It is honestly the same quality you can get in Montreal.

Their fries and coleslaw is amazing too. The fries is super fresh and a bit soft but in a good way. The coleslaw is not creamy at all, it tasted like mustard and very refreshing with the rest of our food. 

This spot is definitely a gem in Scarborough and I'll definitely go back with friends again!"}
{"text":"Very friendly. Sandwich was packed very sloppy and the entire bag was oily. meat was on the dry side. Would not visit again.

I was the only one in the restaurant with 2 tables who already had their food. Too busy to pack a sandwich?"}
{"text":"Sumilicious has the best Montreal smoked meat.  The meat is incredible; it's tender, juicy, chewy and so full of flavor.  I've asked for fatty, and I got fatty.  The sandwich is just perfect with the fatty meat, pickle and mustard.  This place is cozy and with amazing service.  The owner is very friendly.  He told me that he had worked at Schwartz's and he is making the meat with his own special recipe now.  Come here to try the delicious Montreal smoked meat sandwich and pair it with a black cherry soda!"}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place out! And they didn't disappoint! I ordered takeout over the phone and food was prepared & ready to go by the time I got there. The service was great- everyone behind the counter was all smiles & friendly! (pls don't change once you guys start getting famous & the lines are out the door). My bill came to $62.65 for: a large plate of smoked meat plate, which came with plenty of slices of bread, as well as3 meat sandwich combos, which came with a crunchy pickle, fries salted just right & tangy coleslaw. As for the taste: I found the cuts in the meat plate were really good. I wasn't a big fan of the bread, and the sandwiches could use more mustard. All in all I am a very happy customer and I'll be back for the meat plate! Do note: they only take cash or debit."}
{"text":"A new smoked meat joint? In Scarborough??

It sounds crazy but Sumilicious is worth the trip.

We arrived around lunchtime on a weekday and the place was quite busy. I decided to keep it simple by ordering a smoked meat sandwich with a side of coleslaw.

The 'wich was ready to eat just a few minutes later and my god, it's an enormous concoction. It comes wrapped in paper - greasy, greasy paper - and when you unfurl it, the whole thing kind of just falls apart. It's a veritable (and intimidating) mountain of meat.

But how's it taste, you're wondering. It's good. It's very good, in fact. The meat is super tender and moist, as they've smartly mixed the lean pieces in with the really fatty pieces. It was actually a perfect blend.

I wouldn't say it was the most flavorful smoked meat I've ever eaten - the spices were subtle to the point of non-existence - but combined with the tasty deli mustard and fresh rye bread, the sandwich is pretty damn great.

(The coleslaw is a cut above, as well. It's not the creamy style but rather the vinegar-based type, and I loved it.)"}
{"text":"Thrilled to learn that there is a montreal style smoked meat joint in scarborough. 

Came on a Friday night with my friends. We were able to grab a table right away and there weren't any line up. (Perks of visiting a new restaurant!) The restaurant has just opened recently, I suspect it may get busier as people learn about this place.

I got the smoked meat sandwich combo. For $12.99 you get a smoked meat sandwich, a side of fries, a small coslaws and a whole pickle.  It was a filling meal, overall I enjoyed mine, but I wish the smoke meat would be more fatty (my personal preference). The bread is standard, nothing special. I really liked the coslaws cause it balanced the saltiness of the smoked meat.  The pickle was juicey but a little bit too salty for my taste so I couldnt finish it.  

Most people just come in and out for a quick meal. We also saw a couple of people getting takeout.  Also, they have special items on the menu (smoked whole turkey, duck etc) where you will need to place an order ahead of time and pick up on a separate day. Good for parties or any event."}
{"text":"I am not a smoked meat expert nor do I eat it often but I would say it is my best smoked meat experience so far! Lol
I came here Friday for dinner around 7pm and there were a few tables occupied. We were lucky to have come in when we did as the place became busy very fast. 
We ordered three different items: Smoked meat sandwich ($8.99), Smoked meat combo ($12.99), and Smoked meat poutine ($7.99).
The sandwich was a huge portion as it came with a generous amount of meat. It was very tasty and definitely very filling as I was only able to eat half a sandwich.
The smoked meat combo includes the sandwich along with fries, coleslaw, and a pickle.
Usually, I never like coleslaw that comes with a meal but I really loved the coleslaw that they make here!
It was refreshing and I thought it complimented the sandwich very well. They also give you a whole pickle instead of the usual 'sliced' pickles you would have expected lol
The smoked meat poutine was delicious and definitely great for sharing. It is a big portion with a lot of smoked meat on top. Everything about this poutine was great as every bite was warm, cheesy, and infused with gravy. 
We ordered lean meat for all orders and you are able to make a request for the type of meat you want.
All in all I had a great experience dining in. I thought the service was fantastic and the guy who worked the cashier was very kind! 
The food and the service I was provided is a well earned 5 stars. I would come back again and recommend this place to friends/family."}
{"text":"I really want to love sumilicious but i think i might not be a huge smoked meat fan in general. I still liked it.

I've been twice - the first time was a few weeks ago soon after it opened. It's situated at the corner of steeles and middlefield - you can see the sign on driving on either street. Both times the people working there were courteous. One person was at the cash and one was taking orders and slicing meat - it takes some time for them to slice the meat and so I stood for a good two or three minutes at the counter waiting to make an order. So know that it's not necessarily fast - call ahead maybe? There were a couple people sitting and eating and maybe 3 people in line at any one time. Curious what the experience would be when it's busier.

Reading Yelp reviews is what taught me the second time to ask for medium fat, otherwise you might get dry parts. However, the people there don't make it known that this is a choice - perhaps a sign by the counter would help customers pick what they would prefer and curb comments about dry bits.

A sandwich is 8.99 which is a good deal - lots of meat with mustard. I find the bread not as good as the meat (the crusts especially are hard to chew). The meat is good but after a while it starts tasting all the same given how much there is (that's where I think that smoked meat might not be my cup of tea because.. this is how smoked meat is). Since everyone is commenting about Schwartz's from what I can remember it's sliced thinner at Schwartz's and more tender in my memory - taste is on par though and it's flavorful. 

A combo is 12.99 - it comes with fries and coleslaw and a pickle - same as Schwartz's. Personally I prefer just the sandwich or maybe even just the meat (which is an option) because the sandwich alone is incredibly filling. The fries are somehow saltier than the meat. They are poutine fries - more soft than crisp and maybe it's because I got takeout but some were a bit soggy. They also added some sort of seasoning to make it spicy but it was too much salt for my taste. The truth is that along with the smoked meat, this is a very salty meal - it comes with the territory and is something I expected but I don't like the feeling in my mouth and I still needed a lot of water after. I probably wouldn't get the fries again. With tax it comes to about 15 dollars - the combo does not come with a drink but I think I would have liked to have it be part of the combo since that's fairly standard at most places.

tl;dr - big portions, the sandwich is more worth it than the combo imo, drink lots of water"}
{"text":"This is a new spot known for their smoked meat! The overall feel of the environment is very relaxing, it's a cool spot with good music. It's a good place to grab a quick bite to eat. 

My friends & I got the smoked meat sandwich, smoked meat sandwich combo (w/ fries, a dill pickle & coleslaw), and a smoked meat poutine. 

The smoked meat sandwich was filled with plenty of meat, so much so it was difficult and pretty messy to eat. Their portions, however, are very generous and leave you stuffed. The sandwich typically comes with only mustard, I do recommend adding sauce yourself on the side. The meat was tender & had a good chew but overall with the amount of meat it was pretty dry. The sandwich was $10.15 (after tax) & honestly it's not a waste of your money. I do recommend getting the combo ($14 after tax). The fries are amazing & the pickle/coleslaw will help provide the acidity needed for such a meat heavy sandwich. 

The poutine ($9.05 after tax) in my opinion was better, mainly because the base of the dish was the amazing fries. The gravy was also very good & they didn't go light on it either. They did lack in cheese though. I also prefer this dish because the smoked meat was still the star of the dish but it wasn't overpowering. 

PS Bring a drink!!

Overall a good spot"}
{"text":"When I first found out about this place I wasn't too sure to go try, but from reading several reviews that this place was really good I had to go see what the hype was. 

First time coming here I wanted to order a lot of food but just from the photo's it looked like the portions were big. So to be safe I had just ordered the classic smoked meat sandwich. When I first saw the sandwich it was huge! So much meat falling out of the sandwich buns. Quite a messy sandwich but it doesn't matter its all about the taste! 

First couple of bites, there was so much flavor. The smoke meat was moist more juicy than anything, not dry, a little fatty and tons of flavor.  I haven't eaten a smoked meat sandwich in a long time but this was delicious! 

After finishing the sandwich I was really full! The sandwich doesn't look very big but its just packed with so much meat which makes the sandwich so good and very filling. Every bite there's meat falling out of the bread lol but that's whats its all about! Definitely best place to get smoked meat sandwich or any sort of Montreal smoke meat without having to go to Montreal. Only thing I wish they did was make a sandwich combo where they would give a bottle water included with the sandwich, as you may get thirsty after eating that. Or even a water dispenser on the side where people can get their own water.  

Definitely coming back here again and trying out there poutine's and other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Tried this for lunch and it was delicious. Best smoked meat sandwich I've had in the city. Would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I had the poutine from this place and it was quiet good and very filling. I wasn't a big fan of the gravy but it was still good and why they lost a star was because they don't use real cheese curds. the staff are friendly and go above and beyond to ensure your happy and wish them the best !"}
{"text":"Amazing place for smoke meat sandwiches and smoked meat poutine. The smoked meat is full of flavour and super juicy. I thought good smoke meat places can only be found in Montreal but I think this place will be my go to place from now on. Lol definitely saves me a long drive the next time I'm craving a smoke meat sandwich."}
{"text":"Toronto finally has a place that serves Schwartz style smoke meat. Moist, soft and delicious. This place has only been opened for a few months and they are selling out of smoke meat. We were there on Victoria day Monday and there was a steady stream of customers. Seems like a lot of the customers were former Montrealers. Now we don't have to drive to Montreal for our smoke meat fix! This is the only time I will eat fat. Order a MEDIUM smoke meat sandwich which means it will have a small amount of fat. This makes the sandwich tasty and moist. The sandwich also goes good with a Cott black cherry coke and a order of fries. We are from Mississauga but will drop by Sumilicious every chance we get. Hands down the best smoke meat in the GTA."}
{"text":"Wow! Amazing smoked meat sandwiches and super friendly staff. The portions were very generous and they were all very yummy. The smoked meat itself had a great ratio between fat and lean, well spiced, and not salty. They were also hand cut, which makes them even more flavourful. The poutine was very unique in taste, as their gravy had a tasty spiced flavour to it. Def a must try!"}
{"text":"This is the best smoked meat in the GTA. Perfect balance of spices and low sodium in the meat. Clean store. Happy staff. Go check this place out before the lines start outside the door. See you soon guys!"}
{"text":"This place had its grand opening last Friday and tonight when I went, there was already a decent flow of traffic. Great for take out and dine in (several tables are available). Owners were very friendly and appreciative.

Portions were generous for its price. I shared the large smoked meat plate (comes with several pieces of bread) for $16.50 with my boyfriend and we were both very full. For the meat, I didn't see the option for choosing lean, medium, or fatty etc., but they did serve a bit of medium and fatty on our meat plate. I only wish the meat was even juicier.. it wasn't dry but I think I was expecting super juicy meat but for some reason, mine wasn't. That's ok, not a deal breaker. 

I'd also recommend trying and sharing the $7.99 smoked meat poutine (only a dollar more expensive than a regular poutine). I'm glad we don't have to mission all the way to Montreal for smoked meat now and I wish this business success!"}
{"text":"Much needed smoked deli for this area!!
Smoked Meat is halal!!
Wish they had more halal options!!
Friendly staff too"}
{"text":"Do you love authentic Montreal smoked meat? Do you neither want to do a road trip over to Montreal, nor downtown Toronto to get your deli fix on? 

For folks in Markham and Scarborough, you are in luck. Sumilicious is a decent place to get your Montreal smoked meat sandwich pangs satisfied.

I have flagged visiting this place for a while. Although my usual hangout of Shopsy's Markham has changed names, but still offers deli items, Sumilicious is much closer to where I live.

I had a light snack after work. I was still hungry by the time I was back in Markham. I pulled into this lot and parked.

The entrance is pretty much next to the sidewalk facing Middlefield Road. It's an odd setup, but you can't miss it with the red flag and signs above the door.

I walked in. There are a handful of tables and chairs. It's kind of small if you are a large group and were hoping to dine in.

I ordered the Montreal smoked meat sandwich. It goes for $8.99. It's up to you whether you want to go lean, medium, or fatty. 

The owners are friendly and enthusiastic. I got my sandwich fairly fast. I paid with my debit card. The place also accepts cash, but not credit cards.

My original thought was to drive home and eat my sandwich. When I got into my car, the yummy smell of my sandwich caused me to eat it before driving off.

You get a generous (I'm talking a ton) of smoked meat in your sandwich. The mustard and bread were perfect. The smoked meat was flavourful and juicy. It was delicious! You need two hands. If you don't get deli meat falling out of your sandwich, you are doing it all wrong.

The plaza can get busy. I'd recommend parking further away and walking over.

I'm hooked. I'm coming back to try more.

The meat is juicy, tender, fresh and tasty! The portion sizes are very generous. You will 100% be full. I ordered the smoked meat sandwich combo, it comes with fries as well. To be honest, I enjoyed it a lot! 

The Customer service is excellent and they were very helpful whenever somebody new walk through the door. They also helped recommend dishes that were popular on their menu. When new customers walk to the door sometimes they would give a sample when the customer was unsure about trying their sandwiches. 

Whenever I will be in this area and I'm craving smoked meat sandwich I would definitely come back for seconds!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a monday night, looking for some good old fashioned smoked montreal steak meat.  The decor of the place is simple, just like a normal deli.  What i like the most is that they will slice the meat by hand in front of you.  You can see the perfectly smoked meat and juices ooze out as they slice it (mouthwatering).  Food portions are pretty good for the price your paying.  We ordered a normal poutine, smoked meat poutine, and a smoked meat sandwich.

Normal poutine: just your typical over the counter poutine that you can get anywhere.

Smoked poutine: now this is what you wanna order.  So its a regular poutine, but they put a generous amount of chopped smoked meat on top.  And im telling you it is just heaven.  That smoked meat put the poutine into a new other level.

Smoked meat sandwich: what can i say, the star of the dish is the MEAT. And that is what they did, there is more meat than there is bread.  They put some mustard on the bread, and thats about it.  The meat had a tasty crust and moist centre, just the way a proper smoked meat should be.

Overall the experience was good, would definitely comeback and try their other menu items.  Personnel were very friendly and welcoming.  If your craving for some delicious deli sandwich or a good poutine in the scarborough area, this is your spot. Wont regret it."}
{"text":"I'm loving that this area is getting different new joints run by adorable families. Right when we walked in you knew they wanted to give you a great meal. The meal did not disappoint. Great price point as well. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"We had two smoked meat combos.  The sandwiches were huge and delicious.  The smoked meat was moist and full of flavour, the bread was fresh, and the mustard was a lovely addition.  The combo came with fries.  The home fries were great and came with vinegar - which made me nostalgic for Montreal.  The coleslaw was good and added freshness to the dish,  and the combo came with a deli pickle.  

The staff is helpful and friendly,  the location is on transit and has lots of parking."}

Montreal Smoked Meat in Scarborough?!

Sumilicious is a small and unassuming Deli in one of the numerous strip plaza in Scarborough. I am excited to give them a try as there is not many deli in the area and the photos/reviews looks promising.

Smoked Meat Sandwich ($8.99) and Poutine ($6.99)
- I ordered my meat medium, just the way I enjoyed it at Schwartz. The chef did work in Schwartz in Montreal before he decided to open up Sumilicious
- Love the meat as it was juicy, soft and flavourable. And of course extra yellow mustard for me!
- Poutine was disappointing as it was not as business photos using Cheese Curds. I love my squeaky cheese. 

Service is friendly and sincere. A nice family vibe. So much better than Schwartz in Montreal.

{"text":"Montreal smoked meat in Scarborough! No need to travel 5+ hours and lineup to get it from Montreal!  Ordered large plate and smoked meat poutine.   So tender, juicy and flavorful. Their gravy so tasty.  Fries need a bit of wait cause they make each order fresh.

{"text":"So good. Fatty smoked meat. What more can I say? Tucked into an inconspicuous strip mall plaza, this unassuming little deli just had its grand opening and we stopped by to give it a try. We ordered the large platter with a side of fries and coleslaw; good portions of meat + bread, very friendly service; fries were fresh and on-point and the coleslaw is the vinegary/tangy type which is perfect loaded onto your open-faced sandwich. Yums."}
{"text":"I went on the grand opening and had the Montreal smoked meat sandwich.  It was delic.  Although I would also like if they had toppings like sliced cheese, shredded lettuce, sliced pickles and chipotle sauce.  I didn't see those options while I was there."}
{"text":"Came here 3 days after opening. It shows promise but not quite there yet. The sandwich was a tad dry and didn't have enough flavour. The smoked meat poutine was much better since it has gravy. I'd give it another try after they get settled."}
{"text":"Come here to put salt in your mouth! :) Because salt doesn't cost money... right...?

I got the smoked meat poutine and it came to a total of $9.05 which isn't bad for the portion of meat you get on top. They also have a display window where I watched them cut the meat and assemble my poutine.

The meat is just salt. 
The fries aren't noteworthy, just oil and salt.
The gravy has a peculiar taste of its own, and the amount they drown evrything else in will make you gain 10lbs.
The cheese curds dont melt under the heat of all the other components, something's wrong here.

Simply, disappointing. If you want poutine, try Popeyes."}
{"text":"Scarborough got a new addition to the food scene and it's smoked meat! The owner is from Montreal and apparently had worked at Schwartz prior to opening up shop here so he really knows his meat. I tried the Smoked Meat Sandwich ($8.99) Sumiliciousdeli which came piled with a very generous amount of meat (over two inches thick) between two pieces of bread and a dab of mustard. The smoked meat was well flavoured with a mix of lean and fatty meats. The lean parts were slightly dry but the fatty parts were phenomenal - melt in your mouth with the fat having almost a gelatin-like texture. Next time, I will definitely ask for more fatty meat on my sandwich. The bread is standard rye bread - nothing special and I would have liked to have a variety of mustard from which to choose from. 

I also tried the Smoked Meat Poutine ($7.99) which, in my opinion, is superior to the Smoked Meat Sandwich and will completely tantalize your tastebuds with handcut fries, delicious gravy, torn chunks of mozzarella cheese and tonnes of smoked meat. I love how the smoked meat layer was so thick that it took some effort to dig past it and into the fries and cheese. I also loved how there was just the right amount of gravy so that every fry was perfectly coated with the rich gravy which is neither too savory or sweet, nor too thick or thin (most likely a 2/3 beef stock and 1/3 chicken stock mix). Unlike the Smoked Meat Sandwich, EVERY piece of smoked meat was hot, tender and juicy (as a result of the gravy) and I loved how the fatty bits of the meat actually started to dissolve into the poutine making it that much more indulgent. The fries were also great - golden fried to perfection with a crisp outside and soft and tender inside. The skin left on it gave it an added texture and flavour. The only critique I have is of the cheese - they were torn chunks of mozzarella instead of curds which meant that I missed out on chunks of that sqeeky goodness that is paramount to a good poutine. Nonetheless, it was still delicious - extremely melty and mixed in well with the gravy adding that much needed creaminess to the dish. I only wished was that there were a bit more cheese, but overall, this poutine was simply delightful. This will be my go to dish from here going forward!"}
{"text":"Highly comparable to the famous Shwartz restaurant in Montreal (that's a BIG deal!).The smoked meat is just so perfectly cooked. There are very few restaurants that can perfectly immitate other famous restaurants... but this place did just that. So amazing, I have so very little to say but in a word - exceptional!"}
