Do not come here.

{"text":"I love Yotis for breakfast, it's within walking distance from my place, I've gone there with my girlfriend and my sister about 50 times. I like it for breakfast because the service is good, it's a cozy warm place, the food is good and the cost is cheap. But I would not recommend the pizza or poutine for lunch or supper."}
