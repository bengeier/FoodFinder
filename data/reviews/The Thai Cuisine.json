{"text":"Excellent restaurant. Went there for lunch, didn't order off their lunch menu because I wanted papaya salad (home made style with shrimp paste) and satay chicken with sticky rice. I make this food myself and loved that it did indeed taste home made. It was delicious and made perfectly.  I've been to many thai restaurants and have been disappointed in the past but If you want authentic thai food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"We have been there few times and it has always been great. If you go for lunch the menu is less than $10 incl. tips and taxes!  Great food, great service. We really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"First off - I think this location used to be called \"My Thai Kitchen\" but recently changed their name.   This place is fantastic in every way. The prices are fair and the food is delicious and portion size is perfect. You definitely get what you pay for. They have lunch specials as well!  The service is something to be noted, it was probably the best service I've had in months. They also cater to those of us with allergies, which I find to be comforting when I'm ordering thai.   You should check this place out if you're leaning towards thai food tonight."}
{"text":"We visit often with our vegan friend who likes the full vegan menu available.  The food is great, but the spiciness is variable depending on who is cooking that evening.  The red curry is fantastic.  Sadly the food doesn't travel well, so I only recommend eating in - delivery is super-fast but separates and tastes sub-par."}
{"text":"Tried the pad Thai here, and it taste better than other spots I've sampled, it also comes with a choice of salad(mango salad is a must)/soup and a spring roll all for $8.00 winningggg ."}
{"text":"This place is nothing to write home about, their was a hair in my food which I kept quiet about because I know my friend would have flipped and the chicken in my  Pad Thai was not rancid but definitely off. The restaurant is cute inside and the service was good but the bottom line my friend and I love to go out for Thai and this is one we wont return to.   On a side note am I the only one who is sick of going into restaurants and seeing the owners teenage son sitting at a table during dinner service playing on a laptop and looking bored. I feel i see this way to often."}
{"text":"We enjoyed real Thai food prepared by Thai lady cook and served by a Thai waitress. The dishes we ordered made me remember of having same taste during multiple visits to Thailand."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the look of this place, the shabby interior is NOT reflective of the fabulous food!  Very veg friendly while still tasting very authentic. The cold salad rolls were fresh and filled with flavor from fresh herbs. Green curry with tofu had a great kick and the coconut rice did a great job of cooling my palate. Lots of takeout business as we were enjoying our meal."}
{"text":"The portions at this place are TINY. I almost died when I opened our take-out bag and saw the ridiculously small amount of food we paid $23 for! The curry pad had an overwhelming smoky flavour (yuck), and the vegan soy duck curry was just a bunch of liquid with some cherry tomatoes (not even cut up but WHOLE) and some lychees, with very little of the \"soy duck,\" and NO rice. For the prices they charge, there should be a LOT more food. Thai Chef, just down the street on Roncesvalles, would feed five people for this price, especially with take-out. I'm extremely disappointed. If the food was at least good, I could suck it up, but nope. Not worth even half the price I just paid."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Toronto from Winnipeg a few years ago. There are a ton of great Thai restaurants in Winnipeg and we've only found maybe one or two good ones in Toronto so far. We tried this place tonight and it was not a good experience. They have a vegan part of their menu which is what brought us in, I had the vegan pad thai and my wife had the pineapple curry. I asked for Soy Shrimp, they didn't have any then they offered Soy Chicken and the server came back to tell me they didn't have that either. I said, just give me tofu then. I had said I wanted it vegan but she still asked if we were ok with egg? We got our food and the portions were TINY. For the price you don't get nearly enough food. The Pineapple Curry had maybe 3 pieces of pineapple and my pad thai had maybe 4 or 5 tiny pieces of tofu. Sucks when you spend decent money on food that will hopefully at least taste good. Will not be going back."}
{"text":"This is the closest Thai place to where I am living so I thought I'd check it out.  I ordered the pineapple fried rice (chicken & shrimp), and while it was tasty it wasn't anything special. The portion size was fine for what I paid, however there were only 2 pieces of shrimp in the entire thing. They used way too much oil and the lime wedge they put on the side already had all the juice squeezed out of it.  Next time I am craving Thai, I will try a different place even if it is a bit further away."}
{"text":"I was exited to try this place because yelp suggested it as vegan restaurant.  I was very critic and not in the best mood specially when we arrived and seated I saw the table cloth with stains. Well close your eyes.. order my food and asked to wave snow pea because I'm allergic and they just told me that will put extra mushroom. Fantastic I love mushrooms. Got the chicken fresh rolls .. chicken was a little and even hard. Not for my taste. Mango salad was good.. fresh and well seasoned. Ok I said .. wait for the entrees.. sautéed vegetable and 1 red curry pad Thai. My sautéed vegetables which I was expecting a good plate was miserable and poor .. I didn't see so much mushroom.. only 4 half so I called the server and she said that usually they put 3 pieces .. so I got 4 and there nothing thy could do to fix it. I was so disappointed and almost angry. To not say nothing about the pad Thai.. which tasted turmeric instead of curry. But the worst was on the shrimps who were spoiled. I called again the server and explained her about but her colleague came over and they start arguing and saying that is the Thai food smell .. that is authentic!  The irritating question was when they asked me what it supposed to do? Well I'm a client not the manager of the restaurant! Well I had to tell them after all this dramma that I am a chef and I cook food everyday!! I asked for the bill. They went in the back to talk with the chef and they came back offering the entire meal.. apologizing for the inconveniences. I appreciated the offer but I don't usually accept food for free.. I decided to leave $20 for the costs or labor and here started the most funny part .. They started to follow me with money trying to give the money back.. holding by the whistle ahah and saying please get your money back.. we want you to come back!! Ok.. at the end food was that great, and may happens to be superficial or not so attentive on cooking fresh food. It was by the menu prices even over rated. However I wanted to share with you this experience.. food was good but they learned how to make it up .. probably I'll be back for another try."}
{"text":"Had dinner here with my girls after wedding dress shopping. It is a pretty quiet and small spot. We had the pineapple fried rice,  cashew chicken, and flat noodles. I thought the food was flavorful but the portions were pretty small. I still prefer other Thai places to this one. I would only come back if I was visiting my girlfriend at work but wouldn't go out my way. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Good food: pad Thai was nice and had s bit of spice, though could have used more basil.  Very good price at lunch. Under ten dollars for a full meal, including a mango salad and spring roll."}
{"text":"this place is a great local spot. I order take out from them and its always ready when they say it will be. dining in the staff are always friendly and the atmosphere is quaint...a nice place to have a relaxed meal....except for one time on a busy Friday when they put me on hold and forgot about me the a servers have always gone out of their way to cater the needs of myself and people with me. The food has been excellent except for once the \"The Thai pad thai \" came out overly sweet ...but like I said I eat here pretty often so I won't hold that against them and it has been good since....the curries ( yellow and green) are especially good if you like spicey food too and the portions are plenty to share"}
{"text":"I feel bad that I am going to leave a poor review for this place but three strikes you are out.  I have been getting takeout from here pretty regularly for the past 6 months.  Let me just say that it's always delicious and very authentic BUT the portions are obviously too small for what you are paying.  The portions were normal the first couple of times I ordered food from there but then all of a sudden everything but the curries were almost 1/3 or more less that what I had previously received.  And finally this past week when I decided I would give them one more try, when I opened my Pad Kana container, the bottom of the dish was actually visible. Maybe it's different when you eat in.  What a shame because the food is good, but this has left a sour taste in my mouth.  (Pun sort of intended)."}
{"text":"My friend and I are both Vegetarian and decided to stop by this Thai restaurant that offered Vegan options. We shared the Spring roll which was pretty darn good, and then came the Vegetable Pad Thai.... Correct me if I'm wrong but their pad thai was the best I've ever had! I really believe that's what authentic Pad Thai should taste like, none of that Thai express business!"}
{"text":"I've been here before and liked it but my most recent meal was an awful experience.  My girlfriend and I ordered the calamari, the coconut milk soup, the Panang curry with pork and the crispy beef with tamarind for take-out. Everything tasted fine, though we felt that the portions were generally too small. Within an hour, my girlfriend got sick and vomited up the entire meal. Shortly afterwards, I began to feel feverish and sick to my stomach. I spent the whole night and the next few days taking almost hourly trips to the washroom. It's now been four days, and I still have sharp pains in my stomach and other lingering symptoms of food poisoning.  That first night, my girlfriend went by after the restaurant had closed to inform them that their food had given us food poisoning and they were exceptionally rude to her. We thought we'd be helping them out by warning them that they were serving potentially dangerous food, but they were dismissive and suggested we'd gotten sick from another meal (which is impossible, because we hadn't eaten anything else together that day). When my girlfriend assured them that we'd been there before and liked the food, they asked for our names to look up our order history and, when they couldn't find any, implied that she was lying. The unpleasant interaction concluded with the staff saying they wouldn't offer us a refund (which she hadn't asked for in the first place) and that they would call me in the next few days (they haven't)."}
{"text":"Fantastic thai restaurant for takeout and neighborhood location. Try the pad thai or bbq duck."}
{"text":"Had the vegetarian spring rolls, hot and sour soup, shrimp pad thai and vegetarian green curry with coconut rice. Everything was great. The green curry isn't as thick in consistency as other places but the flavour was still there. We would order from here again."}
{"text":"The delivery was quick. The shrimp spring rolls and the coconut rice were delicious , but everything else was disappointing and the portions were really small for the price.  Wouldn't bother ordering from here again."}
{"text":"First time so good, second time so bad! How..why??  Some of their \"vegetarian\" dishes that say vegetarian actually contain fish sauce, so be careful!! Not impressed. Inconsistent food and service."}
{"text":"This isn't a high end Thai place by any means, but if you are looking for an inexpensive Thai lunch, then this place will definitely fit the bill.   For around $8 I got the lunch special which  included a generous amount of pad Thai, small mango salad and a spring roll. The food didn't blow me away, but it was good.  Very quick and professional service as well!"}
{"text":"Popped in here off the street today, and was pleasantly surprised.  The decor reminded me of my favourite Thai place back home, so I couldn't help but compare the two.  I ordered the brown curry, and while it was a little blander than I would like it was still very good!  The coconut rice is not the best I've had, but a solid second place.  The second time I dined in I had the pad thai.  Also not the best I've ever had, but among the best I've had in Toronto.  Very reasonably priced, and the service was efficient.  I've never seen it busy, but I have only been at off times.  I'll likely be back!"}
{"text":"I got takeout here a few times, ut was ready super fast, staff is very polite and prices were okay. dishes can be a bit on the greasy side. I ate chicken curry rice, hot and sour soup and pad woon sen (no shrimp) and I think my husband once had a green curry. nothing spectacular but its close enough to eat something every few months. if it wasn't few mins walk from home, I wouldn't particulary bother. 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Start off by saying this review is for a vegan order and delivery.   The order took about an hour as they said it would. I think we're out of their normal delivery range but they made an exception.  First, spring rolls - pretty average... Not in a bad way... Just what you'd expect.  Coconut soup - fantastic... I'd say the highlight of the meal.very flavourful   Taro and tofu - deep fried tofu wedges and I'm not sure exactly what taro is... Looked like fried bean curd or some sort of fake meat. Both were tasty and the sauce that came with was awesome.  Vegan pad thai with soy shrimp - we had them make us a basil version. I'm sure this dish would've been great fresh in the restaurant but the long delivery made it less than stellar. Noodles were stuck together and it was a bit cold. Also, I'd skip the soy shrimp.   The meal was $35 with tax and tip... No charge for delivery. We're both stuffed and glad we ordered. We would order again and if we were in the area, we would check out the restaurant."}
