{"text":"In the mood for a burger, my roommates and I decided to checkout Graze. There were a lot of people waiting for tables, but everyone was seated quite quickly. Make sure to show up with your full party because they will not seat you until everyone is present. In terms of the food, I ordered the smaller burger option and was pleasantly surprised.  It was the perfect size burger if you aren't too hungry or in the mood for something heavy."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp for consistently helping us find amazing restaurants anywhere we travel. My first cheese curd ever and I was floored we ordered a second serving. The beignets were delectable. The beet salad was exceptional. The service was fantastic. The view of the most impressive building in Madison was also a treat. Can't wait to visit Wisconsin again and stop at Graze."}
{"text":"had brunch here with my daughter. The beignets and the cheese curds were to die for. Also tried the pancakes anc corned beef hash. Both were good, but probably wouldn't order again.Picked up a ham and cheese croissant and cherry danish from their booth outside the restaurant during the farmers market as well. Both were delicious. Expensive both worth it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant: local food, amazing ambiance, and a great view of the Capitol building. It is on the pricey side though.
Best cheese curd that I have ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but as a vegetarian (not vegan) it's a horrible place for dinner. Its easy for me to make do at most restaurants but this place doesn't even have enough options. If you feel like snacking over a drink then go but you will starve for dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful place.  Had the eggs Benedict very good.  Service was prompt and friendly.  Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"What a great restaurant! Very simple menu with outstanding flavors. The service was fantastic!!!! We had Mary as our waitress and she was so nice...and accommodating. We ordered stuff on the menu but had to ask what the ingredients were, she graciously volunteered to talk to the chef to make sure they could accommodate my requests, and they did without even flinching...Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!"}
{"text":"If you want to try Graze, go early!!! or during the week. Weekend nights, the line spills out the door because they don't take reservations. It isn't worth waiting for IMO.

The bibimbap my SO got was a large portion and was \"good\" but didn't hear much praise aside from that. 

I got the mac& cheese. This was really really good, but JUST. SO. RICH. I was initially a bit disappointed by the small serving size, but by the last quarter of the dish I couldn't even look at it. It could use a small side of lemony greens to cut the overwhelming richness. 

The location is great, and the building itself feels clean and modern-y, but the lack of fiber materials, tall ceilings, and tons of windows made it loud and difficult to have a conversation. I don't like feeling like I have to shout at my server. 

In all, I wouldn't be opposed to going again but am not in any hurry."}
{"text":"Great restaurant right on the square with a great view of the capitol. Lots of local farm to table selections and very accommodating when it comes to gluten free.  We usually sit at the bar and have always had great service.  The Sunday Brunch is awesome too!"}
{"text":"My ideal Saturday morning has become a trip to the Farmer's market followed by brunch at Graze.  Ramen for breakfast?  You bet.  If you have a hangover, this bowl of deliciousness will kick it right in the chops.  The soup features home-made noodles from Wah Kee (also here in Madison), and--though the menu doesn't say this--I think the same delicious chili sauce that Wah Kee serves is brought to the table as a side.  There's so much good stuff in this bowl--the pork shoulder...the bok choy...the noodles...the poached egg.  There are plenty of other things on the menu that look fabulous (and that I've been tantalized by on other tables!), but me and my Ramen are exclusive--for now.  I also highly recommend a Supernova while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"Well, it's a nice enough space, with gracious service.  And the lemonade was really good.

We stopped in for lunch with our little boy in tow.  I had a perch sandwich that was fine, but nothing to write home about.  And seeing how we've moved to Wisconsin for good and all, we decided to sample their cheese curds.  Those were pretty good, and criminally addictive.  And incredibly filling.  A golden crispy batter surrounding delectably melted curds.  Only after you've snarfed down a dozen in rapid succession do you realize how heavy each really is.  Yes, we were cheese curd rookies.

I was impressed that they had banh mi on the menu & maybe I'll try it next time.  It's a pleasant restaurant that pays close attention to sourcing its provisions.  Our results, however, didn't knock our socks off.  And the spacious, light & airy dining room certainly gives the lie to those wicked little cheese bombs."}
{"text":"Our family goes to Graze frequently and we enjoy it a lot. Our favorites include the oysters, the warm beignets, the cheeses, and -- the Graze Burger.  Now the Graze Burger is a $21 burger and it is super delicious.  It tastes like they really do prepare the ground beef from ribeye, sirloin, etc. scraps as advertised.  So it is a taste treat. HOWEVER, our last Graze Burger was vastly oversalted, masking the flavor.  That was more than the maximum daily requirement for sodium, that is for sure.  Please, Chef Toby, lighten up on the salt!"}
{"text":"Lovely setting, very good brunches & lunches, but after 5-6 times over the last few years, it's clear the Graze cooks just can't prepare a good dinner. Excellent ingredients but consistently put together in ways that don't work - the food just tastes 'blah' and this has been noted by numerous people I've hosted. In addition, the three Pub Burgers we ordered last night were all *very* well done despite requests for two mediums and one medium rare. I usually order 'well done' but have been trying to train myself to like medium burgers and the one I got was like a hockey puck wrapped in hay. The cooks should visit Dotty Dumpling's Dowry to learn how to cook a burger to order."}
{"text":"We splurged and decided to try Graze after wandering around the square in search of somewhere to eat on Saturday night. It was a 15 minute wait to eat outside, but we sat down immediately inside -- really exciting, as I was ravenous.

Our waitress brought water right away, and returned shortly to ask about drinks. They have a variety of options, which of course completely overwhelmed me, but I went with a ginger martini and my friend with a beer (both pretty reasonably priced). They have wine on tap, which is interesting -- I'll definitely try that next time.

My friend got the Graze burger and fries, and I got macaroni and cheese with pulled pork.  Pulled pork usually doesn't do it for me, but I branched out and tried it. Usually, after awhile, every plate of food coming towards our table gets my hungry hopes up as I wonder where my food is; at Graze, our food came before I even started looking for it. The dish small (expected, as it is an appetizer), but perfectly filling. Made with Hooks 10 year cheddar, the noodles were covered in liquidy cheesy goodness. With the tender pulled pork on top, it was very hard not to inhale it. I love cheese, and you could tell that it was really good cheese. One thing -- it was slightly, just a little bit, maybe too salty. I don't know if it came from the meat or the cheese, and it didn't stop me from eating every last noodle, but it did cross my mind.

We didn't get dessert (unfortunately), but our waitress did not make us feel rushed in any way. As a waitress, I know table-lingerers suck, especially when the bill isn't very expensive. She just refilled our waters and smiled.

I love the big windows and the bar area."}
{"text":"I go to Graze often because it is right by my office.  I'm always craving something more from my experience.  The restaurant feels a little cold to me, especially during the day.  One time I ordered the ham sandwich and could barely eat it because there was so much fat (I appreciate that some people might like this).  On the other hand, I really enjoy the beet burger - it's different and delicious.  I'll be back, but hope they can find more consistency with their menu."}
{"text":"Forced to go back here to attend a meeting. Ugh. We ordered bahn mi and ramen and  gnocchi with squash and brussels sprouts and shared. The bahn mi was inedibly strange tasting -- I LOVE the bahn mi from the saigon sandwich food cart and from Saigon noodles. Go there if you want a real bahn mi.  The ramen noodles were fine, but the broth was SO bland. I had to ask for several condiments to try to give it flavor.....we didn't eat that one either. We all loved the gnocchi and gobbled up the thimble's worth that they put on our plate. Once again, left hungry and broke and determined not to return. Why do people worship this place?"}
{"text":"The cheese curds alone earn Graze a 5. I personally think they are the best in Madison, and it is a place my husband and I take everyone who comes to visit us here. Their entrees and drinks are a bit pricey, but their other appetizers and cheese plates are tasty and they have good happy hour drink specials. The bartenders are always great too."}
{"text":"Always a lovely treat for lunch. Don't forget to grab a chocolate sea salt cookie!"}
{"text":"Great locally-sourced food and excellent service. Waiter was very attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. Smoked deviled eggs were awesome, the beet salad good-sized and delicious and I loved that they used different varieties of beets. The bibimbap was enough for two meals for me and was good but not great, though that may be because it was modified to be gluten-free. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Stopped at Graze for Saturday morning brunch.   As expected they were busy.  But we were seated well ahead of the 30-45 minute wait expectations given when we first arrived.  Restaurant has a great atmosphere.  Food was very good.  We ordered the deep fried cheese curds....yummy!  I had eggs benedict.  That was also very good.  In fact everyone in our group enjoyed their meal.  The 3-star rating was a result of the service.  It took a really long time for the waitress to first visit us upon being seated.  We placed a drink order only to wait a really long time again.  In fact, our drinks sat at the bar waiting to be served.  And when we finally placed our order we waited again.  I certainly don't mind a wait during a leisurely Saturday brunch.  Just make sure you check on the table periodically."}
{"text":"I went back 2 years after the fact and it was such a nice afternoon meal. The mac and cheese is rich but very well made (al dente pasta) with a tasty cheesy sauce. I am glad I came back. Their cocktails are good - I had an old fashioned (ok two) and it was decent. Our waitress was nice and attentive, I think I will be back."}
{"text":"Been to Graze a few times now. 

1: The noise in this place is amazingly loud. Don't expect to have a decent conversation if you are into that while eating. It has no ambiance.   

2: The wait staff gets annoyed when you ask for more water, or ask for dessert. 

3: The waitress brought the check before we had a chance to ASK her for dessert. 

4: The waitress who took our order never came back until the end, we had someone else bring our food, we had someone else bring up more water, and we had another person bring our desserts! 

5: We do not drink, so when we said we just wanted water, the waitress became visibly disinterested in our table. Due to lower tip. 

6: Boasting using a canned line about how superior your 'reverse osmosis water system' is when pouring the water is tacky. 

7: Hostess brought us to one table, then I guess changed her mind and then walked us across the room to another table. Who knows why. 

Now the food: 

1: Best Cheese Curds by far. 

2: Not much else. I am serious, out of 6 visits, the thing I still remember as truly tasting as 'superior' as this place acts is the... Cheese Curds. Not a good sign. 

3: Friend who drinks alcohol felt the drinks were 'below Madison average, tasted watered down' I do not drink so this is second hand info, take it for what it is. 

Who is Graze for in my opinion? 

Someone who wants awesome Cheese Curds."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Graze. The food is pretty consistently awesome, and I love to support local fresh foods. While I love the view, I am not a huge fan of the overall ambiance.. always pretty loud, and the atmosphere is a bit stuffy. I think it would be better with more wood, or art on some of the windows. So, while I love Graze, due to prices, spotty service, and ambiance it is just an occasional special treat instead of a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"Lovely decor. Food quite good as well, but the heapin' helpin' of Bartender Disdain (which seems to be a house specialty) served up to those who don't pass muster takes a bit of shine off the experience. Likewise for the passive aggressive attitude exhibited when asking for menu recommendations in general. I even gave the place a second chance to see if it was just me. It wasn't me."}
{"text":"First time i came here was last year. I don't exactly know when but can remember the experience. amazing. Food tasted very good and services is top notch. The restaurant is usually filled so sometimes you may have to wait is a tiny negative but its still worth it to me and my friends"}
{"text":"Terrible bank like atmosphere.  
Best burger in town."}
{"text":"Graze, oooh Graze! If you are lucky to get a table, you are in for a treat. There is a reason why you waited for an hour to get a table. Graze works closely with local Wisconsin farmers. That means that the food is made out of fresh local produce. Everything on the menu is simply delicious. And the cheese curds are THE BEST IN TOWN!!!"}
{"text":"I had dinner last night at Graze.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the look was absolutely nothing like I had expected. Do not think Gastro-pub when you go there and you will have a much better experience. It is more like the upscale, urban restaurants of San Francisco, not cozy or pub-ish at all. After I got past my initial surprise, I was extremely pleased with the rest of our experience there. The wine list was good, although I think a few more California wines would be appropriate for this type of place and the entire menu was definitely short enough to digest easily (I hate restaurants with long menus). We had the pretzel which was very good although not all that 'unique', a very nice salad (albeit slightly saltier than necessary), and a pulled pork dish. The pulled pork was definitely the highlight. They had pork done 4 ways and the mac and cheese. Yum! We also got the hickory nut pie. Delicious and very cozy food.  
The view is fantastic, and the decor is nice and very urban. The window to the kitchen is a nice touch, although mostly you can only see an elevator. Would be better if you got a better view of the chefs. It is quite loud, so if this bothers you, I would suggest sitting outside. As expected, the service was impeccible.
Overall, I will definitely come here again. I imagine that it will continue to improve as they get their stride."}
{"text":"Fresh food, locally sourced, and great service are what make this place worth a visit.  I have never had a bad experience at Graze and I frequently take out-of-towners here because I know they'll be impressed.  

It's cool that they have wine on tap, which is something you rarely see in Madison.  They have a great selection of cocktails, wine, and beer.  

Not to mention the food is worth the price."}
{"text":"Staff are super friendly here! Especially bartenders.

Their food is sparse. One time I ordered the ramen, and there was just 1 piece of pork...
Their chicken and waffles are delicious!! And I rather enjoyed the pickles tray."}
{"text":"Graze is a high-class hippie joint and this is not a bad thing at all. My favorite cheese curds used to be from The Old Fashioned but were quickly replaced by Graze's beer battered cheddar cheese curds. Amazing. I highly prefer this place for dinner over brunch and similar to L'Etoile (same owners!) they offer fresh, seasonal ingredients with a farm-to-the-table approach. The gnocchi is particularly good as well as their pulled pork mac n' cheese. Their drinks are good but overpriced. They don't take reservations which sometimes means a long wait for a table but it is worth it."}
{"text":"The cheese curds and bloody marys here are top notch as well as the burgers."}
{"text":"and I don't give full Stars casually!

Husband and I had our first dinner here during Restaurant Week. Everything was just fine. Lovely service by an articulate and well trained young woman. I'm not a cheese curd fan, but ordered them to start with my (I am a fan of) beer. SICK good. Could only eat 3 due to the richness, but no problem finishing them with my faithful dinner buddy!

Cod cakes - drop dead excellent; I clearly tasted the delicious, fresh cod that I remember having all the time growing up. Beet salad - wonderful. The Pasta with Braised Lamb and the Fried Tofu entrees - ditto. Apple crisp and Bread pudding - also beautiful, tho I do prefer my pudding (just a matter of style and mood). Wine pairings were great too.

No, this is not an inexpensive restaurant/pub. Like l'Etoile, I will probably use it as a bit of a special occasion spot... In fact, we're looking forward to returning for our son's b-day dinner this week."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch in downtown Madison. Can't beat the view. A number of high quality options for brunch, and food is always fresh. Limited selection of options for dinner, although their cheese curds are some of the best in town. Brunch preferences are the eggs benedict, corn beef hash, seasonal scrambler, or burrito."}
{"text":"I'm a pretty simple guy, but I like my simple things to be done well.  I just got the pub burger, with beef and now it's on my top 5 burgers of Madison (mental) list.  I enjoyed the English muffin aspect.  It was a nice twist that I haven't seen.  Asked for it medium rare, and it came out perfect.  So much flavor.  The burger itself was perfectly spiced, with the cheese and bacon complimenting the rest perfectly.  I can't write anything about the drink though, because I'm pretty sure I just got like a vodka neat with some soda on the side.  I think they got that right, but after getting it wrong 5928 times when I go out elsewhere I've given up hope.  
I will be returning."}
{"text":"I have been to Graze at least a dozen times, and I wish I could give it a 4.5. I can't quite give it a 5 because of inconsistency and noise.

Here's what works:
- Cheese curds!
- Wine from a keg (can't you just feel the environment hugging you?)
- Beer selection
- Bibimbap
- Mac 'n' Cheese with Pork (heart attack, but worth it.)
- Fried Chicken & Waffle (There's a reason people love this in the South)
- Cheese boards
- Service - always kind and knowledgable
- Magic coffee
- The view of the capital

Here's what's inconsistent or doesn't work:
- Burgers. They change these frequently, and they're not consistently great. I wish they were.
- The noise. All those glass walls and metal tables & chairs make the sound bounce all over the place. So it's tough to bring your elderly parents (even though they'd love it) or your sweetheart, if you want a quiet night out.
- Breakfast is nothing special.
- The wait. Since you can't make reservations, you have to go during non-peak hours, or plan to wait for 30-45 minutes.

Despite the moderate inconsistencies, Graze is a great restaurant that's become a fall-back option for me and my friends."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance and the best cheese curds in town. They have great house wine on tap as well. I wish the whole menu changed more than just the seasonal section. Some of their old standbys are getting a bit...old."}
{"text":"I never really thought I was agoraphobic, but the wide open space of Graze makes me a little uncomfortable.  Huge windows and high ceilings... yes.  But because there is so much space, it feels a bit cold and sterile.  The food (what little I can eat of it - having a gluten allergy) is okay... What I don't understand is why their menus have to be so confusing.  Do they really need an off-hour menu between dinner and late night?"}
{"text":"I am sold on their lunches, dinners and weekend brunches. This is a must-go regardless of the time of the day, they have great stuff to fill you up for your meal of choice. 

Their menu changes with the seasons since they source locally. So the best thing I would suggest is to look up their menu online before heading down if you like to have an idea of what to order in advance. There hasn't been any item on their menu which I do not like so far, and I have been there more than 15 times in total and still counting. 

Some of their specialties I like include the now-in-season bimbimbap burrito (served during weekend brunch), pork belly buns (appetizer), korean BBQ pork (lunch) and rigatoni & emu meatballs (dinner). Feel free to order whatever that excites you on the menu, they haven't disappoint so far!!

Service has always been excellent for me. I also love how they are so knowledgeable about the menu and so willing to make substitutes for your orders. They really go out of their way to make your dining experience with them as enjoyable as possible. 

They don't take reservations, so as you would expect summer Saturdays will be super busy for them since there is the outdoor farmer's market. If you just happen to be craving some freshly baked pastries or a coffee/tea/lemonade, just stop by their little stall right outside the restaurant. They have awesome croissants, cookies, danishes etc.

So are weekday dinners, yes, even Monday to Thursday too. That goes to show how good and popular Graze is!! My tip would be to go for early lunch )before 11:45 am, or early dinner (before 5:45 pm). Oh wait, now that I openly share my tip, maybe they will start getting a bigger crowd during these 'non-peak' periods ~~~"}
{"text":"Stopped here while traveling through Madison on a road trip.  The Graze employees were very kind and accommodating, and the fried cheese curds knocked our socks off!"}
{"text":"The wife and I dined here for dinner on 8/9/11. Ordered Fried Pickles ($4) and Pork Buns ($6) for appetizers, the Graze Burger ($19!!) and the Burger of the week ($15), fries with both entrees.

This was our first visit to Graze. We had pretty high expectations, seeing as how it is the 'sister restaurant' of L'Etoile. It certainly was the hoity-est place we've been to, and with their focus on gourmet, local ingredients, we were sure we were in for a great meal.

First impressions- No reservations needed- cool! They were very busy, which for a Tuesday night was surprising, but it was election night, and there was a rally going on. The wait to get seated was about 30 minutes, not bad, but they told us 10. Noisy- very noisy. near impossible to have a conversation without shouting. The decor- seemed like they were trying for an artsy/modern look, but all I could think about was how the metal chairs were the exact same kind of metal chairs you always see in interrogation rooms on cop tv shows. Next time you are watching Law and Order, or one of the others, check out the chairs. You'll see what I mean. 

Service was slow, maybe we were just impatient because we were very hungry & we were in a little bit of a hurry, we wanted to check out the rally.  After what was probably 30 minutes, we were finally served our appetizers. The fried pickles were a huge disappointment. There was more breading than pickle. I honestly didn't realize you could slice a pickle that thin! Greasy, very greasy. They tasted like something you would get off a food truck at a carnival. I didn't use the sauce, the wife did and said it was good, so maybe that was the trick. In my opinion food is either good or it's not, and you shouldn't have to drench it in sauce for it to be good.  The pork buns were nothing like I was expecting, which could just be my own ignorance. I was expecting pork buns like I remembered from China One Buffet (on Broadway) back in the day. What we got looked more like a pork taco, but whatever. They tasted ok I guess, not something I would normally order, and I probably wouldn't order again.  The wife said they were 'different' which is usually code for 'not very good'.  At this point, we were feeling a little leary about our entrees.

After what felt like forever (but was probably about 30 more minutes), our burgers & fries came. Not sure why it took so long for two burgers and two orders of fries.  My burger was the Graze burger (fresh ground sirloin, ribeye & short ribs, caramelized onions, cabernet jus, sesamse seed brioche) The burger did not come with any toppings. Just burger, bun & caramelized onions. It looked a little naked, I thought. Now I didn't expect the chef to want to bury his work of beef art under a blanket of cheese (even though we are in the dairy state), but a little lettuce, tomato, pickle or even some raw onions really would have elevated this burger to something special. Without all of that it was just ok. The taste & texture reminded me of a meatloaf sandwich. Which would have been fine if I'd ordered the meatloaf sandwich, but I didn't. I ordered the $19 hamburger. $19!! I guess I figured that I since ordered one of the most expensive things on the menu, that it would blow my mind, but it just didn't. My mistake. In fact, I found it a little salty, and not in a good way.

The wife, being more adventurous than I am, ordered the burger of the week, which we didn't hear the name of and barely heard the description of. Something about a burger with bacon, limburger cheese, and hash browns, served on a play on french toast.  She said it was 'weird, wet and kinda gross' It also was extremely messy, the 'french toast' or whatever it was pretty much disintigrated, leaving her hands a sloppy, greasy mess. 

I know right now you are probably thinking 'sheesh, don't you have anything nice to say?' Yes. I do- the french fries were very good. So there you have it. $46.42 (after tax)  for some darn good fries. 

Not what you'd call a good value. Although, after this experience, neither of us is in a hurry to try the 'sister restaurant' L'Etoile, which would have a significantly higher price tag, so in a way, dining at Graze actually saved us money in the long run. 

An expensive lesson learned."}
{"text":"Simply: really good food and dessert, somewhat generous portions, intriguing drinks, and a bit of a long wait.

I'm from Cambridge, MA so I have pretty high standards of food. My friends have been trying to convince me to move to Madison and I think Graze would be a good reason to do so.

Graze doesn't take reservations or allow you to put your name in via phone, so we ended up waiting for thirty-plus minutes to be seated. The bar was absolutely crowded with people in the same situation, so we stood in the hall between Graze and L'Etoile. 

My friends and I were seated at a booth, which was cozy, but still connected to the lively din of the restaurant. The drink menu looked intriguing, but we were saving our alcohol consumption for the next night, so we passed over it. 

We started with the lamb meatballs and artisan bread spread. I believe bread should be served at restaurants like water, so I always feel ripped off paying for bread. Still, their selection was good and it came with both garlic and herbed butter. The lamb meatballs were moist and stuffed with some mozzarella and came with marinara sauce and thin garlic crostinis. It was amazing.

For dinner, I had the moule frites, which was extremely generous in its serving size of fries. The homemade mayo was excellent. I forgot to tell them that I didn't like cilantro, but it was easily avoided. The sauce the mussels were in was good, though the fennel was overwhelming. My friend ordered bibimbap, which was also really good and tasted healthy. It came with a choice of tofu (I think) and ground pork and she chose the latter. And the crispy rice was crispy, as promised. The biggest eater of us all ordered the gnocchi, which had the smallest serving size. It was also delicious and came with other great flavors (sweet potato, balsamic, nuts and goat cheese). 

Finally, for dessert, we had the cheesecake du jour, which was vanilla with pieces of banana bread, a chocolate crumb crust and chocolate ganache on top with some local whipped cream. It was amazing. Really moist and flavorful and the chocolate didn't overpower the cheesecake. Not a light cheesecake though.

The server was very sweet and we didn't wait long between ordering to receive our food and she very graciously split the bill three ways."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and it was pretty busy. Got a nice table by the window. The cheese plate was pretty good. I thought the food was pretty average compared to other places in Madison. The service was terrific. A lot better than most places, and the drink selection may make me come back just for drinks. Overall, I might come back."}
{"text":"Overrated but decent.  First off, I live in the Ohio near Columbus and we have some of the best burgers around.   Our intention here was to have a grass fed burger. They had a texting table seating system which is always appreciated.  The waitress made excuses about wait times due to crossfit games being in town, as always totally response to give to a customer to start with excuses right off the the bat.  Cheese curds were on point 8.5 out of 10, light breading with a delicious white cheese center.  Burgers, just ok.  6 out of 10.  Quite honestly 5 guys buries this place and they are a chain.  My burger was overdone with a char taste and just wasn't juicy and I ordered it medium.  Not much flavor and left little disappointed.  Fries were decent but again I wasn't like amazing.  Ambiance and atmosphere of the place was a solid 9.  It was cool.  Overall I probably wouldn't go back with so many other places in madison to visit but it was ok to try once."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an Irish Coffee, it was a very cold Saturday morning downtown. The bartender was very nice and a real craftsmen. This was one of the best coffee drinks I have ever had, recommend this place for drinks and brunch. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you'll notice that jeans and a t shirt won't suffice at this upscale casual restaurant. The service is always great and accommodating. The food is another deal. The menu is seasonal or code for limited. Don't plan on getting full because this is the place where you get tasty food, not huge portions, not even medium portions We must call them what they are, SMALL. A place for foodies to go catch up with their elitist yuppie friends. 

Also, plan on spending $35 a person if you want to get near full. No joke, I went there and got a pickle board appetizer and a steak and I left HUNGRY. Had to go get another bite to eat. 

I give it only two stars because a restaurant, no matter how nice and friendly, should fill you up if you spend $35 per person."}
{"text":"Way overpriced to match the overhype. The waitress had to upsell every dish with extra components to make them easily accessible or more enjoyable: \"You'll want to order the baguette  for this to be able to eat it\". Poorly designed menus lead to apologetic and/or aggressive staff. Sorry Chef Miller, but I will not kiss your culinary butt like the rest of this city."}
{"text":"The best brunch, bloodies, and beignets. I mean, what more could a girl ask for?!"}
{"text":"Very fresh ingredients I definitely recommend going. 

They have the most unique Cheese Curds in Madison and a good burrito."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch on a trip from Iowa to Door County, WI. The seasonal punch was made with canteloupe and was excellent. Not too sweet. Service and atmosphere were great....as well as the food!"}
{"text":"Graze has the best fried cheese curds I've ever had. Their pastries (served during the farmers market) are excellent. The interior and location are great. I've been here a dozen+ times for brunch, lunch, and dinner. It's never my first choice for any of those, but if you are dining with others it is a crowd-pleaser. The Bibimbap, cheese curds, and bone marrow stood out."}
{"text":"Been here twice for brunch, definitely go somewhere else for brunch. Won't go in to details, but food and service were a two star at best both times. 

However, went here with a bunch of friends at night. Much better food at night. Great dishes to share. Good drinks and the Iced Magic Coffee. Holy smokes, I'm going to get that to go every time I'm at the farmer's market."}
{"text":"Server was knowledgable and helpful with suggestions. Everything is fresh, selections change. The bibimbap with tofu, which was my first time with this dish and it was amazing. The charcuterie (pâté and culatello) and cheese plate were excellent as well. Highly recommend Graze if you're in downtown Madison."}
{"text":"Graze has got to be Madison's first Foodie Restaurant. I remember when Graze was just a concept of Executive Chef Tory and his team. To get such amazing food combinations you had to dine at L'Etoile or their sister restaurant, Cafe Soleil.

Ever since the move, Graze and L'Etoile have been an epic pair to serve two different clientele some of the most inventive and delicious food. But I regress... this review is about Graze. 

Graze is all about local, sustainable and Deeelicious Food! While I have not experienced this restaurant as many times as other restaurants in town, it is something special to me and I cherish the moments I have with it.

I recall my first visit was very clinical... I checked out the menu in a random selection process and paired my beverages with it. I love the selection and size of the menus as they allow you to share and enjoy with friends or create a great meal that will leave anyone satisfied. I was with a friend for a late lunch so I sampled. 

We started out with the Meats and Pickled Boards. The meats were so delicate and served with basic yet complimentary tasters and bread; while I am a sucker for pickled veggies, my friend really went to town on the meats board. There were many other snacker size plates and to plate them in such variety makes me smile. After getting our palates started we both got the rest of our meal and if I recall right, it was a great way to start the afternoon. 

My most recent visit I shall not forget because it was a day to celebrate and of firsts. This time was more formal and for a dinner date; we both got amazing entrees to which neither of us wanted to share our selection as we were both so enthralled them. The dinner ended with a roasted bone marrow! It was new to me and I definitely enjoyed the experience however I will keep it as a treat cause it can't be healthy, but oh so tasty. And we did add the Luge option which gives you a spot of sherry to rinse the bone and its delicious juices down on to your taste buds. Quite the experience, and many passerby's thought so too.

Graze is rustic with earth tones, farm accents, and a beautiful view of the capitol. The capitol view, with its expansive lawns and majestic trees, only completes the picturesque rustic Wisconsin yet downtown dining experience. A sure place to WOW anyone visiting the city. 

Overall, I would highly recommend Graze if wanting a downtown experience with big city flair. There is something for everyone and even brunch to make up for closing Cafe Soleil, which it does many times over. I know that my next visit will definitely include the Graze Burger, my curiosity beckons."}
{"text":"The problem with reviewing Graze is that there are only so many ways to say \"everything was perfect, and I am obsessed\" before the review starts to sound a little repetitive and boring - the total opposite of Graze (see what I did there?)

So, I'll settle for recommending my favorites from the menu, and trust the fates that you will soon discover for yourself how unspeakably fantastic this place is.

Oysters. If you eat oysters, you want these oysters. Like most seafood fans, I understand that consuming seafood in the upper midwest is at best potentially disappointing, and at worst downright dangerous. Having thus established my own sanity, I will now say that I would eat Graze's oysters in mid-July, during a heat wave, even if I had to shuck them myself. They're that good. Super fresh, beautifully presented, always an interesting and varied assortment, and you actually don't even have to shuck them yourself after all! Go dissipate yourself over a dozen or two of these. You will not regret it.

The bread basket. The bread basket? Yes, the bread basket. It's awesome, and I'm getting dangerously close to eating their compound butters straight. Eat it with your oysters, and level up to Poseidon-meets-Demeter God-tier of delicious.

Happy hour. Take your co-workers and go shoot the sh*t over Graze's excellent assortment of seasonal drafts, and maybe a fancy pretzel or two (mustard on mustard, cheese on mustard, plain pretzel? wow the choices are endless.) And then, when you can't finish your last even-numbered beer, stick your adorable beer token in your adorable pocket, and come back again tomorrow for a free beer, because those things are reusable. Wow, Graze loves you!

But like I said, the problem with Graze is actually that there are too many things to praise, and in Yelp Land, I'm not sure how long unbridled enthusiastic delight can go on before the algorithm melts from insufficient levels of rage-inducing disappointment ...or the character count runs out.

So, in rapid-fire succession: elderflower cocktail, pork buns, magic coffee, bibimbap, charcuterie board, cheese curds, croissants (on Saturdays!), beet salad, lamb sausage...

Just do it; you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Truly a gem in the heart of downtown Madison! It lived up to the reviews! The cheese curds were amazing as promised, with a delicious batter. I had one of the seasonal specials (an Asian seafood broth based dish), my sister had the gnocchi and my mother had the pub burger. We sat outside and had a breathtaking view of the capital. I rarely give five stars and am happy to be able to do so!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the most unique and flavorful restaurants I've been to recently. The waiters were impeccable and friendly. The food was so fresh and you can definitely taste the difference."}
{"text":"Everything was great. I recommend the cookies and milk for dessert, the chocolate chip cookies are fresh baked and still warm and have a hint of salt on the top which is fantastic!"}
{"text":"Brunch review: Recently went to Graze for brunch and it was excellent! We had to wait about 5 minutes for our table, but while we waited we witnessed the chef/owner? wheel food from the farmers market into the restaurant on a wagon. I love that they run out to grab the ingredients they need from local vendors. 
There were 4 of us and we each ordered something different for brunch. Everything was delicious and very filling. My favorites were the biscuits and gravy and the chicken fried steak. The beignets were amazing too!"}
{"text":"The space is chic, but not pretentious, and has a great view of the Capitol. The cheese curds are absolutely magnificent. I had a burger that was on special. While it was certainly good, it wasn't twice as good as a burger you could get elsewhere (at half the price). The sizing (and sogginess) of the bun was awkward enough that it required a knife and fork to eat. But still, it was delicious. The significant other had a steak- although not the tenderest cut of meat, the flavors were ridiculously delicious. You can get beef just about anywhere, but this was truly excellent. It didn't require any excessive seasonings or sauces; the flavor of the beef came through all on its own. The seasonal punch was also quite good (some sort of pomegranate concoction when we went). It was sweet, but not overpoweringly so and had just the right amount of alcohol."}
{"text":"Great food. Everytime I have been hear I have really enjoyed it. Great food pairings. It is expensive but there are some reasonable options next to the 30 dollar fish.  

I have made it out for my last two birthdays in Madison. My father ate the rainbow trout here a year or so ago and said it was the second best meal he has ever eaten, the first being the space needle."}
{"text":"good drinks, bad food.  my husband became sick after eating the grilled pork dish.  wild horses couldn't get us to return for the food."}
{"text":"Excellant food and drink selection, the lack of reservations is something of a turn off for me but wait times have never been over a half hour during the week.

The Banh-Mi is excellent with a perfect combination of spicy, salty, fatty and acidic. The pub burger is an excellent choice as well. Cheese curds are lovely, with a light batter and very good cheddar flavor."}
{"text":"Since the first time I went to Graze, I have probably been back at least seven times in the past few months. Graze is amazing because you can go for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The location on capitol square is prime. Great view of the capitol building makes for an excellent setting. The food speaks for itself. You can't go wrong with anything. All of their ingredients are locally grown making everything taste extra fresh. Also, Graze for sure has the best Bloody Mary in town."}
{"text":"Ate there last night. 
Have been to Graze many times in the past. 
Last night was not one of their best meals. Will start from the beginning. First they got my wife's cocktail wrong, she ordered a Absolute and Sprite, it came with Club soda. 
My son's beers were spot on. 
We then ordered Cheese Curds, they were over cooked and very, very greasy. 
I ordered the Pub burger, medium, it came well done.
Over all was not impressed with the whole menu."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, Sunday. Atmosphere was nice, bright. Service was fine. I love good biscuits and gravy so went for them here. Bottom line, not good. Biscuit was dry, gravy was very pasty, oily  and lacking flavor. Sausage was sparse, not ground but simply cut up links.

The wife had the egg sandwich which was much better, liked the runny egg. But the side of greens was way too salty (dressing and they also added coarse sea salt).  

Good coffee.

Disappointed and surprised by this experience as other L'toile ventures have been excellent."}
{"text":"For all the hype that preceded this place, I was somewhat let down. I definitely enjoyed my meal, and the service was absolutely stellar in all aspects (efficiency, speed, friendliness, and helpfulness), but the food wasn't as good as I hoped. 

As far as the menu is concerned, there is plenty of choice, whether you are a foodie or more of a traditionalist. The pork belly buns were really flavorful and tasty, as were the cheese curds. Fried chicken and waffles were okay, but the seasonal fish dish was a pathetic portion for the price. Probably four ounces of fish on a half cup of rice for $30. Taste was above average, but at that price I expected either a bigger portion or delicious flavor. 

Best entree was probably sweet potato pancakes. A really tasteful blend of sweet (cherry sauce, glazed walnuts, and sweet potatoes) along with salty/savory fried egg and some potatoes."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to go to Graze. I've heard from friends how the ingredients come from local sources and how good the food was. They were right. 

First impressions walking in was how bright the restaurant was. On a sunny Monday afternoon, the restaurant was bathed in natural sunlight because of the floor to ceiling windows. It was a beautiful sight. 

After ordering a refreshing mimosa, I decided to go with the noodle bowl. I am so happy that I made that choice. It was filled tasty items like noodles, bok choy, pork, and an egg. The slight spice gave the bowl a nice kick- even if I looked like I was fighting an internal battle against my stomach. At $10, I highly recommend the noodle bowl. It tasted just like a bowl of noodles I had in Thailand 

Graze is a great restaurant on Capitol Square. I may not be able to go there every week, but it is definitely a place to be if you want to treat yourself to a nice meal."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best restaurants in Madison. Great items on the menu for brunch/ lunch. And a wonderful selection of drinks (try the Bloody Mary - it comes with a beer chaser). Great dinner options as well. And an amazing view of the capital to top it off!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The decor is really nice, and amazing views of the Capitol building through the large glass windows. I didn't think the Popcorn share plate was that great, but the Pickle Board has some great pickled items, super unique and very good. The Graze Burger is a must. I was put off by the description in the menu, as it seemed to be a monstrosity, but order it anyway and it was the perfect size to eat, and absolutely excellent. One of the best burgers I've ever had. If you're feeling breakfast, the Sweet Potato Pancakes are also very good! I look forward to going back to this place next time I visit Madison."}
{"text":"I wasn't really all that impressed with this place. It seems pretty popular given that it seems to be full whenever I walk by, and acquaintances have said they loved it. 

I wanted to like it, as I am all for their \"locally sourced\" ethos.

It's designed as a small plates kind of joint, maybe something like \"midwest tapas?\"  Many dishes are served family style for sharing, but limited entrees are offered.

Our group of 4 went on a weeknight at about 7:30. It wasn't packed and there were a few tables open. We waited for about 20 minutes for them to prep a table. Not sure why it took that long. After we were seated it took another 10 minutes for water to be delivered by a runner. Then another 5 minutes for our server to finally arrive. We had been mulling over the menu over those 15 minutes so we were ready to get a drink order in, and our first round of plates. We all noted the slow service.

The atmophere is pretty cool though. It's mostly windows so you get a great view of the capital building and the square. It is a bit loud, but certainly not as loud as the Old Fashioned can get.

We ordered our beers along with the mac & cheese, the plate of house pickles, and the charcuterie. 

Our beers took  at least 10 minutes to arrive. Then another 15 minutes for the first plates. We asked the server to point out the offerings on the charcuterie plate, but the server could only point out the salame and mortadella, the only ones I recognized immediately. Not much help there. The mac & cheese was merely OK, I like my own better. The pickles, while pretty good, were nothing to brag about. Though I will say the pickled squash was pretty memorable.

Our server didn't come check on us for quite a while, though I'm not sure how long it was because we were contently conversing. We had to flag her down to order more beers and the next round of plates. Not cool. A couple of us also decided to order entrees along with the additional plates. 

This round we ordered the fresh bread basket, cheese board, and deviled eggs. For entrees, we ordered the asparagus/frisee salad, the seafood stew, the market steak, and I ordered the Graze burger, it's touted $19 burger. Yes, a $19 burger. I couldn't NOT try it. Once.

About 10 minutes later and our small plates arrived. These are all good, but how do you screw up bread and cheese? The deviled eggs were pretty good but nothing to come back for. 20 minutes later, the entrees arrived. And actually, everyone loved their entrees but me. Like any good midwestern man, I do like me some burgers. Plus I've got an open mind when if comes to them. This burger is a mix of sirloin, ribeye & short rib meat served on a brioche bun. This sounded fantastic to me, but it didn't deliver. The brioche bun arrived with a completely soggy bottom, and the combined flavors of the caramelized onions and the bun was sweet. Yes, sweet. I do know that brioche can be a sweet kind of bread, but maybe I was expecting something else. Anyway, the sweetness ruined the burger for me. I just don't get down with sweet burgers, even though the meat was high quality and perfectly done. I didn't finish it. The fries that came with the burger were also overly soggy with grease, only the very tips were crispy.

While everyone in our party knew this place was a little expensive going in, we didn't feel we got our money's worth. If I'm with a group that decides to go, I'd probably try it again. There were a couple other menu items that looked good, after all. But I'd rather go elsewhere.

My rating is based on -2 points for the slow, crap service, and -1 point for the lack of value."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our dinner here last night, but it wasn't spectacular enough to make it a regular dinner spot for us. It was surprisingly busy - 25 minute wait for two at 7PM on a Wednesday. To be fair, the cheese curds were delicious and the drinks were unique and tasty, but the pub burgers were just okay. The flavors were good, but they were very challenging to eat. The English muffin bun just doesn't stay together and it was just a mess overall (ladies - this isn't a first date entree you want to take on). All in all, it was good and we enjoyed the ambience, but with the long wait it's not a place we will be frequenting often."}
{"text":"I like to think of Graze as L'Etoile's goofy little brother. It's more casual, less pricey, and offers a little less \"stuffy\" cuisine, but is still delicious, locally sourced, and high quality. Graze is fabulous for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and cocktails. It doesn't matter what time of the day you are heading over, you will always have amazing food and drink options. It's hard to go wrong with any menu choice, my personal favorite has to be the chicken and waffles for brunch. It sounds simple, but when done right, is just amazing. 

Eat here whenever you can!!!"}
{"text":"Bibimbap was very good. Eggs beni too.
Staff seems to know menu well and service is decent.
The view is nice and it's always busy when I've stopped in. Hipster type place, casual setting, upscale pricing -but fresh ingredients. I like knowing where the food comes from and keeping as local as possible.

The only down side is feeling like they are rushing you out at the end... paying this price, I want 5 minutes to finish my coffee after breakfast before being made to feel like we are taking too much time."}
{"text":"I'm always happy here and the wait times aren't bad, even when it's busy. They also have my favorite cheese curds in all of Madison!"}
{"text":"I want to like Graze.  The location is beautiful and the restaurant feels like a destination, and not in a pretentious, taking itself too seriously kind of way.  I've eaten there twice before tonight and kept thinking that one more visit would convert my uncertainty to enthusiasm.  

Tonight's strange grilled octopus and fried calamari salad with blood orange, Meyer lemon, raw red onions and, most strangely of all, olives, was so bizarre, so unpleasant, that I wondered if anyone had bothered to try the dish before sending it out?  What sounded and looked like a nice assemblage of ingredients resulted in a tough mouthful of totally discordant flavors and textures--chewy, fleshy, bland and bitter when I expected smoky, briny, and citrus.

The Bimbimbap wasn't much better.  The best part was the crunchy, hashbrown-like patty of rice at the bottom.  Otherwise, though, the dish was completely drenched in what tasted like a commercial ketchup-peanut sauce that was fiery but one-note.  

Unfortunately, tonight's experience echoes previous trips.  Almost everything on the menu sounds great but there's little nuance to the sides and entrees.  I'll stick to the cocktails and light appetizers in the future."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Graze for a couple of years  and I always find something interesting on the menu.  I don't want to give a glowing review that everything is always wonderful because some things I think are just OK, others are pretty good, and a few items I really like!

Some things I rate as OK but nothing special: the Biscuits and gravy at brunch and Roasted Bone marrow

Some things are pretty good: Noodle bowl

Some things are really good:  Bibimbap burrito, Corned Beef Hash, Roasted Beets, Artisan Cheese board

Great ambiance.  I love sitting at the bar and the dining room gives off a really nice vibe.  

Great drinks, good Bloody's at Brunch, interesting beer selection, enjoyable craft cocktails!

Great service.  The bartenders are friendly, the servers do a great job of keeping track of how things are going without being overbearing, and the staff in general is very pleasant!

Remember to make a reservation because Graze gets crowded early!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!

The boyf and I were in Madison for the weekend and decided to try this place out.  We were a little worried that they don't take reservations (especially after we got into town and realized it was Winter Fest), but the wait was really not long.  When we walked in, there were a lot of people waiting, and the hostess told us it would be about 45 minutes.  It was really only about 25 minutes.  In the meantime, we grabbed a couple beers from the bar.  It took a while to order them, but the bartenders were working their asses off, so I'm not going to criticize them on that front.  

Our waiter was totally friendly and calm despite how busy the restaurant was.  

To start, we ordered the artisan bread basket and half a dozen oysters.  The breads were sooo gooood.  A couple crusty rolls, a piece of rosemary focaccia, and what I think was a small brioche.  All were hot and delicious, and they came with both an herb butter and a garlic butter.  I didn't have any of the oysters, but the boyf enjoyed them.  There were 2 each of 3 different kinds, and he said the Kumamotos were his favorite.  He said the Naked Cowboy ones seemed like they might have been frozen (who knows).  Can't remember what the third kind was, but he liked them.  

The boyf had the spiced rainbow trout entree and totally loved it.  I had a small piece, and it was really good.  I had the mac and cheese and the lamb meatballs.  I did really like the mac, although it's not the best I've ever had.  The lamb meatballs were om nom nommmmmmm.  Get them.

For dessert we split a pear and cherry crumble with a scoop of housemade ice cream.  So.  Good.  It had a wonderful hint of ginger, and the ice cream was dreamy.

Definitely eating here again the next time I'm in Madison."}
{"text":"After eating here only once, I can say that this is my favorite joint in Madison. I came here after reading Yelp reviews, and the whole experience lead me here again to write a Yelp review. 

Must have: Pork belly buns. These buns alone are a religious experience, and merit a visit in itself. The slow cooked pork belly melts in your mouth just as it hits your palate. The meat is perfectly seasoned and the fresh baked bun taste like heaven on a plate. I could eat maybe 3 orders of this and die a happy man.

We ordered some more odds and ends from the Meat & Cheese board and were not disappointed from the local fare. 

If you're not afraid of full flavors and want to venture past the ordinary, come here. For a place like Madison, this restaurant definitely stands out, but I believe this place can hold it's on in any culinary city in the U.S.A."}
{"text":"I want to like Graze more. The highlights, Great atmosphere! I love their local take on everything. All their food (and most of their drinks) come from local vendors. Graze has a really great concept.

The bad news is, their service is inconsistent. I was recently at Graze on a weekday night (weeknights they have reverse happy hour where drinks are half off 9-11!). We were sitting outside and I wanted to order a dessert. I asked the waitress where I should order. She said the bar. That's fine. I walk to the bar and order. The bartender asks if I want to pay now (I say yes) and says he'll have someone bring it out to me. Then I wait, and wait, and wait for the bartender to take my money. He finally came back to tell me I could go outside. Yes, but I need my change, I tell him. He goes on helping others and doesn't take my money. So I leave it there. I guess he gets the change as a tip. Then, the waitress brings out the dessert and it is not what I ordered. I tell her this. She just looks at me and leaves. That is pretty bad service in my book. 
 
The food is also quite pricey. I don't neccessarily mind paying more if I know my food is coming from a good place. And it CAN be good. Unfortunately, the food is also somewhat inconsistent, too. The cheesecake they ended up giving me (instead of what I asked for) was only mediocre."}
{"text":"Graze is generally pretty crowded for weekend brunch, lunch, and dinner times... which is a good sign. The service is great, with attentive servers, wait staff, hosts/hostesses and the food is reasonably price considering it's location in the Square. The food is consistently good -- not exceptional but definitely good. The food that I have generally like tend to be the Asian fusion-y type foods like their bibimbop or their straight up vegetable dishes, e.g., platter of beets.  

I don't know that I would make this a \"must go to\" destination because there are a lot of great places to eat in and around the Square but it's definitely safe. Suggestion -- if you are going to go on the weekend, it's definitely better to make a reservation because it gets crowded."}
{"text":"First off I would like to say I interviewed Chef Tory for a sustainable themed class about a year ago. He was an incredibly open and informative person. As a head chef of two of Madison's top tier restaurants I found it incredible he was willing to sit down with a college student and explain not only the concept of Graze but also his own background.

The concept behind Graze is local sustainable cooking. In a day and age when it would be much easier and cheaper to get ingredients from Sysco or some other food distributor I think it is commendable to purchase from farmers. Chef Tory informed me, that although they do it partially because it is better for the environment, another motivating factor is the freshest and tastiest ingredients come from farmers who are not across the country from the restaurant.

The menu is incredibly adventurous and with a seasonally changing menu will continually afford new options. My personal favorite dish from the part of the menu which does not change is the Bipimbap. For the seasonal menu the Beet Burger with blue cheese and walnuts was incredible. 

Graze also has a great selection of local beers on tap and bartenders who know how to make a mean cocktail! 

And to top it all off, the space makes you feel as if you are in a restaurant in down town New York with a gorgeous view of the capital square!"}
{"text":"I have been to Graze twice and I would go back again. Their menu is eclectic and varied and there are vegetarian options for me.

The portions are a bit small... I wish they were larger."}
{"text":"I love their bibimbap and magic coffee. I will definitely go back again and try another of their meal and dessert. I really like the feel of the place. It can easily a restaurant for date night but it is also still a place where a family can gather and have a meal together."}
{"text":"I love Graze! Highlight is their cheese curds -- they're the best in town, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Updated:  Still love this place.  I've been for Brunch, dinner and late night snacks and have never had a bad meal.  The wait staff is knowledgeable and clearly loves food.  If you want a good place to eat and you are in Madison, you wont' go wrong here.  Go, you won't regret it.  

This place is smashing.....get the bone marrow."}
{"text":"Went here with coworkers for a going away party, and was told that the one thing to try were the cheese curds. Boy, were they right. Yum! I also had the deviled eggs, which were delicious as well. Their entrees were great too. I had the mussels, and I'm not usually a fan of seafood, but they were spicy and delicious and didn't taste fishy at all. There are plenty of desserts to choose from - you won't have anything bad at all! Only downside is that this place is pricy."}
{"text":"Ambiance = 5 stars
Food = 4.5 stars
Service = 2.5 stars

The space is awesome - it feels like you are in New York or Chicago.  It is modern, yet very comfortable.  It has a modern farmhouse feel.  The food was really quite good.  My wife and I shared several dishes including the beet salad, mac and cheese with pulled pork, cheese curds, and the Graze burger.  For dessert, we split a piece of hickory nut pie - outstanding!  It was all very, very good.  I also enjoyed their beer selection.  The only downside was the service.  It was really SLOW.  We were there at 6:00p on a Tuesday - not exactly prime time.  We tried to be understanding as we were there on their 5th night of being open.  I hope they get the bugs worked out soon - we can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I liked the interior OK but a little cold for my taste.  View is spectacular.  Chairs just killed me--very uncomforable hard metal. 
For food had the scallops starter and the short ribs.  Scallops were a little cool and lacked the nice crust I like on a scallop.  They tasted fresh and would have been fine if they were a little hotter and crusted.
The short ribs were just awful.  I have had them at several very good restaurants around the US and they were melting in your mouth tender with most of the fat rendered out by slow long cooking.  These were tough and retained most of the original fat. Awful, awful awful.  Learn how to cook these or get them off the menu. I suggest calling \"Crush\" in Seattle to see how they do it right.
I'd try it again using some of the better reviewed items as a guide."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time when my parents came in to visit for the weekend. We had originally planned to go to the Old Fashioned because I'd heard so much about it, but the wait was over 1.5 hours! We all LOVED Graze. My parents are really picky about loud places, and we found this place to be not loud at all. I've read some other reviews complaining about the noise and it makes me wonder if we were in the same restaurant? We had an easy 30 minute wait, during which time we sat at the bar and conversed with the bartenders over wine and their homemade bread basket ($4). My mom was super impressed with the bartender, who seemed to notice that she has been deciding between some red wine and their seasonal punch, and brought her a generous sample of their punch on the house. The entrees that we got were the mac and cheese with pork ($12), pork3 ($22), and trout (maybe $18? can't remember). We had nothing but praise for all of these! They were all fantastic and we were very impressed. The food being from local farms only added to the experience. Everyone was very friendly and not pretentious.

Not sure about the other low reviews on here, but we had  fantastic time. We were glad the Old Fashioned was full so we got to try this place instead."}
{"text":"Great food, even for vegetarians :) I had a phenomenal gnocchi. Hubby loved the trout. Our dining pals enjoyed Bimbimbap and the crazy pricey burger. They were jam-packed on a Friday and the service was still great and everything well prepared.
Wine was just OK, but I'll reserve judgment on that as I may have picked something that didn't go well with gnocchi."}
{"text":"We love Graze. Excellent atmosphere, perfect view of the Capitol, and nice outdoor seating in the summer/fall. 
Must haves:
Pretzel appetizer, White Truffle Popcorn, Hooks Aged Cheddar Mac&Cheese, Pub Burger


Pros:
Great food, fresh ingredients, locally sourced
Excellent ambiance/cool decor
Easy to fit large parties (as long as you're willing to wait!)
Friendly Waitstaff
Great Vegetarian Options!

Cons:
No reservations, so if you go at a busy time, plan to wait for at least an hour"}
{"text":"Had the chicken and waffle,pork shoulder,both really good!!!drinks weren't fantastic though...expensive for such small portions"}
{"text":"My wife and I went for Valentine's Day dinner.  Service was kind, prompt, and attentive, but not overbearing.  1st course was lamb shoulder ragout w/ \"gnudi\", which were sheepsmilk ravioli without the pasta wrapper and were very good.  My wife had festival squash ravioli, a new taste sensation.

We both had pan seared sea scallops for the 2nd course with sweet potato puree and a sorghum BBQ artfully painted around the plate.  I had never thought of putting BBQ sauce with scallops, but it worked well.

Dessert for my wife was chocolate-banana bread pudding and vanilla bean cheesecake w/ strawberry sauce for me.  Both were excellent.

The wine pairing with each course matched well.  The pinot I had with my first course was probably the best wine I've ever had.

Atmosphere was also very cool with the capital building framed by the front window.  Slightly on the pricey side, but I guess you get what you pay for.  Overall, one of the finest meals I've had.  Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Had the noodle bowl for lunch last week, yuck. I couldn't finish it because it was so tasteless, and the soft boiled egg in it was just weird. I had lunch there before and had the hamburger and cheese curds and both were so good. Will not let the noodle bowl stop me from going again."}
{"text":"My fellow foodie friend and I went to Graze yesterday for lunch, and were impressed by the space and the quality of the food.   We were, however, disenchanted by the high prices.  

The good:
My companion and I shared the pork buns and the pickle sampler for appetizers, and were delighted by both flavor and presentation.  The pork buns feature a generous slab of tender pork ensconsed (like a taco) in a soft, moist bread, and the 5-6 types of pickles (two types of picked cucumbers, cauliflower, daikon radishes, kim chi) came served in individual little bowls nestled on a wooden slab.  The pickle presentation was a delightful blend of rustic and artistic, and the house fermented veggies were the perfect pre-meal nosh.

For a main course, I had the beet and chevre salad, while my friend enjoyed the pork sandwich.  The pork sandwich  featured a liberal amount of moist, well-sauced pulled pork on a buttery brioche bun and came out with a lovely little side salad.  My beet and chev salad was both tasty and beautiful with pickled beet halves arrayed on field greens with a smattering of toasted pepitos and a creamy, well-balanced dressing.  Yum.

The bad: 
With that said, the salad was way too expensive- not enough bang for the buck.  Priced at $10, you would expect the beet and chev salad to be entree sized, but this salad was too small to make a meal of it.   Compared to Marigold Kitchen's bountiful and comparably priced entree salads, the Graze salad was positively stingy.  If I hadn't had the appetizers, I would definitely have left wanting more but without enough left in my wallet to justify buying a snack from L'Etoile's renouned bakery.  Or even from Wal-Greens' snack aisle.  Wah wah.

In response to arguments that the price is that high because Graze uses local/organic ingredients, I myself am an avid locavore who has a CSA, shops at the co-op and is willing to spring for local/organic produce.  That being said, all of the main ingredients on the salad- the beets and greens- are IN SEASON right now, and I know from my own personal shopping at the Farmer's Market and Willy St. that it would cost, at most $1.50 to purchase the amount of beets and greens that were on my salad at the store.  Given how abundant these items are at this time of year and how SMALL the salad was, this salad should NOT have cost $10.  Especially for a venture associated with promoting fresh eating, this was a big disappointment.  

In sum:
Graze's food was delicious, but either the portion or the price of the salad needs to be adjusted because it is unjustifiably pricey. If the restaurant did that, I would be \"grazing\" there regularly.  Hopefully the second time is a charm... and a bigger portion."}
{"text":"I can't say anything was bad. I am a fan of  L'Etoile. I just think it isn't better than other similar places downtown like Merchant, Nostrano and the now burned down Underground Kitchen, it just costs more. Not a good value."}
{"text":"Lovely pickles, great burger, and an amazing cheeseboard. Best meal I had in Madison. Consider me a fan."}
{"text":"Diverse menu. I was here for lunch and had the bibimbap. It came in a huge bowl and the staff were very accommodating with substitutions. The rice cake at the bottom went surprisingly well with all the toppings ! Great cheese curds and fried pickles"}
{"text":"I have to confess that I'm more than a little bit obsessed with Graze. They can pretty much do no wrong in my eyes- but that's because everything I've had from here has been consistently delicious. I've also only been to brunch but am very much looking forward to going for dinner and trying out their infamous burger.
For brunch had the bloody mary with jalapeno infused vodka which was amazing- pretty much a meal in and of itself because of the toppings (celery, cheese curds, sausage, etc)
They do a classic eggs benny but the ingredients they use elevate it to a different level. The potatoes that come with them remind me slightly of latkes which I loved.
Chef Tory's Breakfast Sandwich looked tiny at first so it was a slight surprise given the price but it tasted incredible. And was surprisingly filling given its size (but I had also had half of the eggs benny order at this point)
The bibimbap burrito is MASSIVE (especially in comparison to the breakfast sandwich ^^) and is so. good. The only critique I have about it is that the meat was on one side of it so when I split it I got the half without any meat and my friend's half was fully loaded. But at that point I'm just trying to find something negative to say.
Oh and the cheese curds. Definitely one of the best in Madison. Way better than another place that many consider to have the best cheese curds in Madison. 
Also love the free coffee refills.
And the floor-to-ceiling windows.
And now I've realized I need to go back to Graze ASAP."}
{"text":"Great option on the Square -- fantastic cocktails and small bites. Great for brunch.

I think the main menu is getting a bit tired, as the chef is busy with other properties. It just needs re-imagination or a shake up.... Right now, there are so many better alternatives downtown Madison.

Making reservations sure would be nice. Seriously..."}
{"text":"Stunning windows, food was pretty tasty. Love the drink menu. Service can be at times wonderful but the staff sometimes can seem overwhelmed when they get busy and it shows."}
{"text":"Meh.  Views of capital are great, but everything else is average or less.  Had better food in many places about Madison. Often is noisy and overly busy. Service is very spotty. Just be aware of what you're paying for, and it is only for the location and view."}
{"text":"Perfect compliment food wise to L'Etoile - casual but gourmet.  Everything I've had on the menu is good."}
{"text":"I'd like to preface this by saying that Graze is actually one of my favorite places in Madison, though it can be hit or miss depending on what menu they put out for the season.  Their drinks are pretty good, their food is pretty good, but nothing about it really stands out to me.  I think, relative to the Madison area, it is definitely one of the better options, though in any larger city it would not stand out for its price range.  Nothing on their menus has stood out for me, but neither have I had anything less than tasty.  4 stars in Madison, 3 stars elsewhere"}
{"text":"Graze is my favorite restaurant in Madison. Not only is the view incredible, but the atmosphere and food are unbeatable. The menu changes with the season which makes it that much more exciting each time you go. The food is fresh and local-- never over the top. You can always get classics like mac and cheese and the best cheese curds ever. Or you can go crazy and try one of their more creative dishes like my favorite beet and walnut burger on a pepita bun. The restaurant itself is trendy yet sophisticated and the service is great. The restaurant is well run and even when the wait is very long, they have a website that shows where you are in line and texts you when your table is ready. Overall, Graze never disappoints. Come for the food, view, and energy!"}
{"text":"Things I liked about Graze:
1. The elderflower margarita 
2. The goat cheese dumplings 
3. The French fries

Things I didn't like about Graze:
1. The loud, echo-y room
2. The hype around local when a good part of the menu is not
3. The long wait time and not taking reservations

A very nice meal but I wanted to love it more than I did. I had the Bahn Mi, which was tasty, but I wanted it to be either more authentic or more inventive. Instead it was stuck in the middle. Full of fresh Thai basil but also with dry ham that did nothing to enhance the flavor. 

The service was friendly and informative and I liked the carafe of water on the table."}
{"text":"MAGIC. COFFEE. 

Try it, and you won't regret it. It really is magical. I've been here on two different locations, once during the summer and again during the winter. The menu is seasonal so they are constantly switching things up. 

Their pretzel is delicious. Salty because of the excess rock salt found on the pretzel, but delicious. 

I got their beet salad in the summer with some cheddar and mixed greens. Beets and cheddar... who would have thought the combination of the two would be so delicious? 

In the winter, I ordered their bibimbap... which was an interesting experience. I'm Korean, born and raised in Los Angeles where the  Korean population is HUGE. Having said this, having fried rice (literally fried) with ground pork in my bibimbap was a new experience. It wasn't bad, actually it was quite good. I should warn you though, the gochuchang (the red pepper paste) is spicy. Like burn your tongue, I need a giant glass of milk spicy. It starts off sweet, but it'll build faster than you think and leave your mouth on fire. 

Graze is amazing. It's an affordable, alternative restaurant that you should really check out while here in Madison. It offers locality, seasonal goods and a freshness that really can't be beat."}
{"text":"#1 favorite restaurant to visit in Madison. The burger is great, and the cheese curds are beyond phenomenal. VERY FRESH. The atmosphere is wonderful as well- with the all glass windows overlooking the capitol."}
{"text":"I went there for brunch and tried the Fried Cesar's Cheese Curds and Beet and Walnut Burger. I wasn't super impressed with the food and thought it was a tad bit overpriced. That said it may have been the choices I ordered as my friends thoroughly enjoyed their Pub Burgers."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in town!
Amazing food, not too expensive, great atmosphere, and the staff are so nice!

Great for a dinner date. 
try the beet and walnut burger, you won't regret it!

The only down side is they don't take reservations so sometimes the wait can be 1hour+ for weekend dinners."}
{"text":"Super popular hip restaurant in the Capitol area of Madison.  Not crazy about the hour long waits, but I did enjoy the farm to table offerings.  Their seasonal lemonade was fantastic - mine was cherry raspberry.  For appetizers we had the mac and cheese made with 10 year old cheddar.  I realize the cheese was aged but I think it would have benefited from a blend of cheeses to make the flavor more complex.  The artisan bread was tasty, but the style was more homemade than artisan.  They were rolls like the kind you could make in your oven at home.  Truffle popcorn is a huge trend right now, and I was glad to try their rendition.  It was natural popcorn, a little salty and a hint of truffle.  I think I would've preferred more of a dunking of truffle.  Finally, the cheese curds.  AMAZING!  The breading was light and the dipping sauce complemented nicely. 

For our entrees we had the warm farro salad and the fried chicken and waffle.  The warm farro salad was great - a lot of fresh vegetable ingredients and a nice tangy vinegarette dressing.  The fried chicken was a bit disappointing.  The batter was laid on very thick and so the chicken was encrusted with this coat of batter that didn't have the unevenness or crispy texture you'd get with a light hand battered chicken.  Overall, a good restaurant - high end and hip with good farm to table choices.  Next time, i'll stick with more vegetables."}
{"text":"Graze is my one of my top 3 restaurants in Madison. The bibimbap is phenomenal, and their cheese curds are the best in Madison! Atmosphere is great too. 

They don't take reservations, so go early on a weekend, or enjoy the wait by walking around the Square.  Their drink list is awesome too - and if you like wine, try their keg wine. It's delicious!"}
{"text":"I would move to Madison just for this restaurant. Seriously! I have celiac disease and need to have gluten free food: this is the perfect restaurant for me! Plus the food is DELICIOUS. Try their seafood stew, it's the best."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  Drove over from Milwaukee with out of town guests, were looking for a delicious Madison brunch.  I guess we should have gone elsewhere...
Were quoted 30 minutes wait, which ended up being 45.  We were all starving, so we had memorized the (nothing special) menu by the time we were finally seated- after one of my friends questioned the wait when there were empty tables everywhere.  Nothing on the menu appealed to me, so I asked if there were any specials.  The waiter says, \" well...the only thing that's not on the menu is a 3 scrambled egg thing, kind of like our version of an omelette, but 3 scrambled eggs with some potatoes and greens...\"  Fine.  Ill have that.  Half of the things my friends ordered they were out of, by the way.  I understand the farm to table concept and limited quantities, but come on.  Please have something edible to serve if you're going to make us wait an hour for it.
     20 minutes later, everyone elses drinks came, but not my simple draft beer- that came another 10 minutes later.  30 minutes for a beer?  That's should have been a sign for how long the food would take....
  When we finally had food in front of us- 2 hours after arriving- the \"3 egg thing\" actually WAS an omelette, with veggies, goat cheese and more like 1 1/4 eggs.  It was good, but deserved a more accurate description.  I was still hungry after cleaning the plate.  My friend's benedict included poached eggs that were actually hard boiled- a sin on a benedict.  The rest of the food was mediocre/ cold.
   Not worth the wait or cost."}
{"text":"A great place for a casual date with a marvelous view of the capitol. The view will also impress your out-of-town visitors.  The appetizers we ordered were really delicious and the entrees we ordered  were good but not memorable. We will definitely return to try more of the appetizers."}
{"text":"Disappointing brunch. Wanted to love it. But corned beef hash was lots of potatoes with a little bit of very fatty meat: like a potato skillet. Nutella French toast was a hit.  Service was slow."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic brunch! The chicken and waffles was exceptional, \"broasted\" fried chicken which was tender on the inside, sweet, spicy and crunchy on the outside with sweet pickles. The bipinbap burrito was unlike anything I've had before. Filled with julienned veggies, pork, crispy rice, and a Kimchi-like mixture. The setting is cool: high ceilings, floor to ceiling blackboards with the meats and cheeses of the day, and the Capitol outside. I'd go back in a second!"}
{"text":"Tried an excellent falafel sandwich!!! Tasted the amazing reubens and AU NATURALE wisconsin cheese curds.....I'll never go back to the SISCO pieces.... :)"}
{"text":"Chicken. Waffles. Biscuits. Macaroni and cheese. Onion rings.

Eat here."}
{"text":"I've visited Graze a few times since it opened and enjoyed everything! I'm a vegetarian and I agree that there should be at least one additional meatless sandwich and/or entree. We've loved the popcorn, the bread basket, the deviled eggs, both the wedge and beet salads, and the sundae. Those all make a perfect, comforting meal in my mind! Go in with a plan to actually graze rather than stuff yourself and expect to pay slightly less than you would at L'etoile, you'll leave happy."}
{"text":"We took a friend out to celebrate her birthday, which we mentioned to our waiter. We waited 25-30 minutes for our order to arrive, with no bread basket to nibble on while waiting & starving. Bread costs an extra 5.00 (approx)! When food finally arrived, my Mussels were in an abundance of delicious sauce, but no bread or rice to soak it up. Instead, French Fries, which although delicious, did nothing to soak up the cup of sauce. My husband ordered a rare burger, which came only slightly pink, not rare. The chocolate cake came without a birthday candle or song & was not given as a gift, as most every restaurant  does. Chintzy right down the line.... Almost impossible to hear/be heard without pantomiming & yelling over the constant loud background din.
Decor gorgeous though, & our waiter friendly & knowledgeable..."}
{"text":"Oh Graze, let's be honest - you had me at wine on tap.  Every time I eat here it confirms the fact that once Wisconsin finally allows polygamy, I will marry you Graze and have your babies.

This place has me seriously considering adding strawberry season to my Google calendar so that I don't miss out next year.  The strawberry panzanella and strawberry shortcake were nothing short of amazing.  Other favorites from my most recent visit were the fried pickles, pork buns, and artisan cheese board.  The cheese curds are good, but not my favorite in Madison.

Great atmosphere with lovely view of the Capital.  If you haven't been, it's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Another fantastic Madison restaurant. Cool set up w/ large walls of glass over looking the Capital Dome. Food is first class, and have option to eat outside. When it got chilly our request to move inside for dessert was quickly accommodated. Not an inexpensive spot but at least you get top quality food, all very well-prepared."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, excellent atmosphere. Heavy on the pork. Just a touch pricey."}
{"text":"Had brunch here. The service was a little slow, but the menu was interesting and the food was delish. I had the croque madam-which was smooth, buttery and toasted to perfection with a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg atop. My friend had the breakfast sandwich which see enjoyed as well. The Kir-Royale? Well honestly...if anyone would chill the Champgne properly, it would make a world of difference. Trust me on this. I would go to Graze again. It was clean, and tasty. A nice new addition to the rather lackluster lunch choices in Madison."}
{"text":"Moules frites was very nice; I took the server's recommendation in ordering bread as she said that many people liked to enjoy the sauce with bread. 

Pork buns were interesting and tasty. I was originally skeptical, but the pork was moist and tender, and the open-face presentation worked well."}
{"text":"We were in Madison for training. This resturant was recommended by the hotel.  The view at night was amazing.  The capital is directly across the street and makes for a great picture.  The resturant is ultra modern with decor. I had the Graze Burger with gluten free bun. It was great that they did have gluten free choices. The only problem is they saturated the bread with butter.  I wasn't thrilled with the house wine that they try to sell you on. Next time, I will choose a different wine. Service was good. It was a good experience."}
{"text":"The food was OKAY. The atmosphere was OKAY. The wait was reasonable on a cold Friday night ~ 1 hour. I arrived at Graze for the first time with my fiance, and we both were pleasantly surprised by the variety on the menu. We got cheese curds as an appetizer that were delicious. For the meal she had their fried cod, and I had the Graze burger. The cod was nothing to write home about, but with so many choices on the menu getting fried fish was a poor decision on our part. The actual burger portion of my Graze burger was great...the bun was terrible and soggy. I'd like to give Graze another shot, but the first experience was exactly what my rating indicates - OKAY."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar because it was so crowded.  Very fresh salads and cheeses were outstanding.  The sweet potato cake was interesting but a bit dry.  Overall, very solid four stars.

Come by around sunset. If you get a table by the windows, the views are stunning."}
{"text":"Stunning Interior Styling!  Hard to get a table on the weekends. As most Madison dinning, they don't take reservations.  Small curated food selection. The core menu doesn't turn over often, so not a lot of new options if you visit a few times. Unique cocktails"}
{"text":"My husband and I were spending the weekend in Madison and this was the first place we had dinner. We weren't sure what to expect but it was packed and that's always a good sign! We lucked out getting seats at the bar so we didn't have to wait for a table. Our bartender/server was great! Even on a super busy night he was still super attentive and we never felt like we were waiting around. 

Let me just say how AMAZING their sangria is. IT IS AMAZING! I could have had it by the pitcher... It is seriously the best sangria I have ever had in a restaurant. 

The food was also great. I ordered the bibimbap. It said it was spicy but I guess my husband makes things so spicy that this wasn't hot at all. Which is a good thing for me! I love Wisconsin spicy! They were also super helpful when it came to our dietary restrictions. I am vegan and my husband is vegetarian and they gave us special menus and even came to ask my husband if certain ingredients were okay for him. Way to be on top things! Our meals were delicious and if we weren't wanting to try a new place each night, we would have returned here in a heartbeat. I look forward to the next time we're in town and can come back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Bloody Mary very good. Corned beef hash was more like skillet, corned beef didn't taste like corned beef, too sweet, I know that sounds strange by taste it and you'll know what I mean.eggs on top were very good.Chicken and waffle was disappointing, chicken was over cooked. Cheese board was good as was the service."}
{"text":"Graze is really excellent. I highly recommend the bibimbop and the fried cheese curds. The brunch is really great too. I love the atmosphere--it is wonderful to sit outside or next to the huge glass windows that look onto the capital square."}
{"text":"We went in at 9:50pm on a Wednesday night. 
They stop serving food at 10pm but everyone was very nice and willing to get us food before they stopped serving. 
We ate deviled eggs, fried cheese curds, Mac n cheese and roasted vegetables. Everything was very good. 
Thanks for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Me and my girlfriend stopped by for brunch today...finally. I really wanted to find a five star breakfast downtown but the search continues. I had the corned beef hash. As others have commented, it is rather uninspired. There were a few bites tucked away in there that had potential but overall it was mostly potatoes and the size did not warrant the price. The eggs were cooked perfectly though. I have to admit, it is hard for me to go to a restaurant with corned beef hash on the menu and not order it. Don't get me wrong, this hash is good but much like other things on the menu it is not worth the price tag. 

Girlfriend had the kielbasa and again the eggs were great and the apple and potato hash they were sitting on was great. However, the dishes namesake seemed to just be plopped there on the plate, slightly undercooked, and not really important to the dish at all. 

The bread was spectacular and I want to figure out where they get it from so I can just buy that. 

I will go back to Graze, and hope that next time I can give it at least a 4. Increase the portions, it would be a 4. Decrease the price, it would get a 4. But as it stands this food does not live up to the price tag and was disappointing. Is it Graze's fault I had such high expectations? Yes, because they charge 12 dollars for a weak piece of kielbasa and a few potatoes. Lame."}
{"text":"Nice food, good service, and nice ambience. I've been here several times. I recommend the burger for the main dish and roasted veggies as the appetizer. Good to be there on happy hour. The only problem last time was that outdoor seating area was so dark we couldn't see what we are eating! Lol"}
{"text":"My husband and I didn't have an opportunity to try the food at Graze.  Inside the restaurant on Friday night it was chilly cold.  We asked about an outside table and they said it was too hot to serve outside but we could enjoy a drink there.  Finally a 90 degree night in Madison (and there was a breeze)...all other outside restaurants patios were busy with diners but they must hire delicate servers that can't handle the heat.  Quite a disappointment!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience at Graze.  The food and drink is outstanding and varied and painstakingly locally sourced for the most part.  The bibimbap with the crispy rice is fantastic and different than traditional in a good funky way.  The Graze Burger is possibly the best burger in Madison (and that is a big claim!).  

It is always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"We went about a half hour before the lunch rush, which was a good idea. It gets busy, and for good reason. The staff were really friendly and helpful.

Lots of unique flavor combinations and perfect portions. It's clear that a lot of attention is paid to every part of the meal, right down to the fresh and airy french fries."}
{"text":"One of the best places for casual dinner in the city. Uniquely inspired menu from one of the city's best chefs, great wait staff, awesome views of the capital, this place has it all. Pro tip: In a group of 2 on a weekend night, wait for a spot at the bar instead of a table. One will usually open up in 5 mins or less, while the tables take longer than 45."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped for brunch here on 10/4.  I should have done my research to learn that they only do a limited brunch menu all day as opposed to their full menu on Saturday.  I was really looking forward to trying some of the items off the regular menu so I'll save that for another day.

I had a bloody mary that was good.  Very different flavor than what I'm used to, and I really enjoyed it.  

I had the Burger.  It was ok.  Not bad, not the best I've ever had.  I would eat it again, but when I go back I plan to try some items from the full menu instead.

Service was fine.  They were busy, but we were seated right away.  Server was nice and stayed on top of things.

All in all, I would go back, nothing turned me off.  And the setting with the windows looking out towards the capital is fantastic.  I look forward to going again sometime!"}
{"text":"Graze is one of the best restaurants to go to in Madison, Wisconsin. It reminds me of a restaurant in Manhattan. Service is always excellent. Excellent overall."}
{"text":"The location is superb and the decor is fun and modern, but the food is a mixed bag for me. I've had brunch there and I appreciate the more interesting twists and ingredients used in some old favorites like French Toast. I enjoyed my brunch a lot, as did my friend. I've eaten dinner there which was just okay. On a third visit, I found the cheese curds to be...and I hate to even say this because I love cheese curds...really disgusting. 

My group actually had a rather involved conversation about the pros and cons of the cheese curds and most were not fans. Their curds are different, sure, but plenty of local Madison establishments do a slightly different take on cheese curds and they're amazing. These are oddly sweet, the cheese isn't great and the addition of vodka...it comes off as trying too hard (which rings true for some of their other choices as well).

Clearly lots of people love Graze but I think there are much better restaurants within a 1 block walk."}
{"text":"We went in to Graze the day before the great blizzard of Feb '11. We were a large, rowdy group of 11 and Graze was more than happy to welcome us in. Living up to our boisterous reputation, we were officially the first set of customers to ever request for shots at our table! 
The rest of my review will be the vegetarian perspective - note that all my friends with no dietary restrictions absolutely loved their food as well. Our table(s) got a number of cheese plates, cheese curds and LOTS of bread. It was all so good. The bread in particular, with the herbed butter, was spectacular.  By far, as everyone else mentions, these felt like the best cheese curds in Madison! I wasn't very hungry after eating all the cheese, so I got the Warm Farro salad. It was bursting with flavor and was well sized. The lack of an entree was sad, but I wasn't overcome as I had stuffed my face before!
For dessert, they brought us out cupcakes - the bourbon one was SO good! 
Our server was fabulous, we tipped him extremely generously. We left full and happy."}
{"text":"This place is interesting.  The space is awesome, high ceilings, chalkboards, industrial lighting and an incredible view of the capital.  The bloody mary was great as was my scramble, magic coffee, & beet salad.  Service was not great and thus a 1 star subtraction.  Food was slow and servers were not attentive but props for everything being local.  I would absolutely eat here again."}
{"text":"I want to love Graze. I really, really do.  It's got an amazing location, and the food, when you get what you want, is very solid. Not amazing, but fresh and local and tasty. The problem is that in my past three visits, we've never once received what we ordered.  We request simple substitutions (twice it was egg whites instead of whole eggs for omelets), get the wrong dish, and then, each time, wait ages for the new dish to arrive, while the other people in our party's food gets cold.  On the \"fool me once\" principle, we won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! Nice environment, great food. I got their burger and it was awwwwsome! It is so well cooked and juicy and not feeling oily as another burgers! Could be my favorite burger in Madison :)"}
{"text":"Well, thank you very much Graze! All other burgers have been forever ruined.  The Graze Burger is simply amazing!  Seriously, my boyfriend and I savored every single bite....and when there were no bites left, we cried a little inside.  This $21 burger is the most expensive burger I've ever had the honor to eat and it was worth it! Yep, completely worth every penny!  The Graze burger is a delicious blend of local meats (ground bacon, ribeye, short ribs and sirloin), with perfectly caramelized onions, some sort of out-of-this-world sauce,  SarVecchio cheese, a light and tasty bun and homemade fries with garlic aioli.  Do yourself a favor and eat this burger!  
We also split the Bipimbob which was a new flavor for both of us.  Love the crispy rice squares and the spice was perfect.  The overall flavor was powerful and exciting.   This is a must try!
I appreciated the short wait for our table (only 10 minutes) and the personable wait staff.  Multiple interactions with various employees (hostess, waiter, a supervisor) were appropriately fun and light hearted.  
I can't wait to return to Graze.  The food is amazing, the wait staff is attentive and I love that this is a local restaurant that supports local food sources."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to take guests visiting me.  The view of the capital at night is stunning, the cocktails are yummy and the food is always interesting (in a mouth watering way).  Oh, and a great lunch spot too. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Excellent place. 
The decor is modern with a nice view of the capitol. Nice choices of cocktails and wines by the glass. The staff is efficient and welcoming. A serious effort is made to provide local offerings. The food is really good with interesting flavor combinations. For example I had a trout with chocolate mole mash and it was simply awesome.
Will definitely be back when in the area."}
{"text":"I love coming here with a group of girlfriends, although I think my husband is bummed because he always misses out. Great atmosphere, great food, and love their commitment to local farmers and purveyors."}
{"text":"Fresh, great location, smaller portions but that ok!  Really fresh food that was well prepared."}
{"text":"Food and service are top-notch at this place.  Order the burgers, beer, anything on the menu-- it's that good.  Local food is their thing and they do a great job at preparing it.  Unfortunately, they don't take reservations, but it really doesn't matter because the wait is worth it.  Plus, they have an awesome bar where you can order yourself up a drink while you wait to be seated.  I've been to Graze for both brunch and dinner and I haven't been disappointed yet."}
{"text":"Suggestion to whomever is in charge;  OpenTable!!!!   Terrible first  impression of a restaurant.  Making someone wait 15 minutes to even find out any scenario is pretty pathetic. And btw,  glad I cancelled going to your sister restaurant...."}
{"text":"I had brunch at Graze with friends and ordered the chilaquiles.  They were good and I would order them again.  However, the first ingredient listed in the description for the chilaquiles was slow roasted pork, but there didn't appear to be very much pork.  The sunny side up eggs that topped them were perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious.  My friend had the Eggs Benedict and also liked her meal.  While we all enjoyed our meals and the atmosphere, along with the fresh and local ingredients, there was nothing overly memorable that would pull us back here.  But I would suggest trying it out if you are already in the Capitol Square area."}
{"text":"Every time we have out of town guests we ALWAYS bring them to Graze to show off Madison. Be it dinner, brunch or happy hour. Between the view (hello all glass view of the capitol), the local, fresh and tasty food and the attentive service we always want to go back."}
{"text":"Haven't had a chance to visit L'Etoile since the move, but I've dined at Graze a number of times - brunch, dinner and late night.

Fun, inventive menu by Wisconsin standards (no, this isn't a backhanded compliment - but, yeah, it sort of is) with a number of hits (but a few misses).

The ramen is actually quite good; definitely not authentic by any stretch of the imagination, but well executed.  The broth had great body and flavor, the Wah Kee noodles a great, chewy consistency, and the radish served as a nice foil to the unctuous pork belly (how about a few more pieces, though?).

The banh mi, though, was a dud.  It really missed all the things I usually love about the sandwich - the chicken liver pate definitely wasn't as assertive as I'd like, the pickled vegetables lacked zest, and the baguette missed the mark on texture.  

Charcuterie plate and bone marrow are winners. Nothing else to report on that front.

Brunch dishes are all serviceable, and pastries at Cafe Soleil are well executed; all in all, a great place to take a break from your Farmers' Market wandering (hey, maybe you'll run into Chef Tory while you're out there).

Service is unremarkable, but it's more of a casual place as opposed to it's big brother next door.  I give Graze 3.75 stars, rounded up to 4."}
{"text":"I ordered the soft pretzel with mustard for an appetizer and white fish cakes for lunch. I also had a rum punch cocktail.

The food was okay. It wasn't anything special or memorable. On the other hand the cocktail was great and I would go back to fast other cocktails.

The staff is friendly and service is fast."}
{"text":"I really liked the food and felt that the quality and freshness of the ingredients produced flavors that were like very few meals that I have ever had.

I ordered the GrazeBurger and couldn't help but notice that the burger was obviously made in such a way that set it apart from almost every other burger that I have ever had.

With all that said, our cheese curds, 2 GrazeBurgers, Asian pasta entree and 3 nonalcoholic beverages ran $95.00. Everything was delicious but for the $30+ average ticket I probably won't be lining up again that soon.

As delicious as it was, $21.00 for maybe a 6oz burger left me feeling a bit out of my element."}
{"text":"Great food, and excellent, friendly service! Add in the best views in Madison, and it's a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"Been here twice and loved it each time.  Great cheese plate and generous sandwiches.  Atmosphere is very relaxing."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner; it's very nice, hip yet down to earth kind of a place.  Huge glass windows with great views of the Capital Dome.  I had the braised beef dish, an order each of the artisan meats and cheese platter.  The beef was wonderfully prepared, very tender.  The appetizers were good but nothing to rave about.  They have a good selection of beers but not an extensive wine list.  For dessert, I had the bourbon pie or something, pretty much a variation of a pecan pie, it was excellent! In general, the food, and atmosphere deserve the stars, the one star deduction is for service, which was a bit slow and could've been more attentive.  Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a laid back spot. This would be a great place to meet a friend while having a bite. 

Service was great. Food came out pretty quickly. 

I ordered the pub sandwich with fried cheese curds. Pub sandwich was pretty small. The English muffin bun was hard and thin and the bottom came out super soggy. The salad it came with was great- fresh ingredients. 

The cheese curds were delicious but the size of the order was a lot even for two people. Perhaps order a half size? I found it too much cheese to eat at once."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Madison. Good for a date. Excellent location. I love their buns."}
{"text":"Two words: Pub.Burger. And truffle popcorn. Okay...five words. These are my favorites - and the things I've had most often at Graze. But I've also been there with friends who've raved about the chicken and waffles and the bibimbop and the mussels. It's one of those places where you always have entree envy - even though what's on your own plate is perfectly wonderful.

I also love the ambience at Graze - led by that breathtaking view of the capitol. It's gorgeous in winter, when it gets dark early and the leaves are off the trees - so you see it in all its lit-up glory. And just as pretty in the golden twilight of summer, sipping a craft cocktail and dining al fresco. 

It's one of my favorite late-night spots, too. Many's the time I've had a cocktail and curds after a show at the Bartell. They always taste sssooooooo good. 

What else? Oh, yes - the service is always great. I've never encountered a server who wasn't totally on his or her game. They're attentive and friendly - and they know the menu. You can't ask for more than that.

Graze is always a place I enjoy returning to."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed after my first visit to the Graze and I doubt I will be back. Some friends of ours were in town from Milwaukee and we met them at the Graze for brunch. After being seated we noticed we had dirty water glasses and requested new ones. Our waiter appeared as though he had just rolled out of bed and seemed like he was high or something...so the service we received was not good and his unprofessional appearance was not very appetizing. We then proceeded to wait almost an hour and a half to receive our food. Some of the tables surrounding us received some beignets on the house to apologize for the long wait, however, we were not one of them. Instead our waiter offered few apologies and kept bringing us more coffee in more dirty cups. We ordered the cheese platter to share amongst the four of us and our waiter never brought us plates so we akwardly tried to eat it right off of the platter. Not to mention the portions were minute. I got the lox on a bagel and it was downright disappointing. The bagel was neither toasted nor fresh, it was stale. And the amount of lax wasn't even enough to cover one half of the bagel. Again for the price you pay at the Graze so not worth it. It is a shame because this place has a great location and appears to be a nice restaurant, however, dirty dishes, minute portions, the long wait and unprofessional waiters do not make me want to go back or recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese curds, strong cocktails, excellent variety.  Between the ham grilled cheese and the walnut beet burger we were very satisfied.  The shrimp sandwich was nothing noteable.  Great staff and beautiful atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very good locally sourced food and friendly service. Small menu. Was in the mood for an awesome salad, but other than a small plate of greens or a wedge salad, there wasn't anything on the menu that hit that need. Venue is absolutely beautiful."}
{"text":"After hearing all the hype, I went to Graze with some friends.  I love the idea of locally farmed foods, and was anticipating a wonderful meal.  I found the menu to be...um, how shall I say it...interesting, in that it was a lot of strange food combinations that seemed to be put together just because they were strange combinations, not because they actually went well together.  I found to food to be both boring and greatly overpriced for the mediocre quality.  Considering the lack of ability to even carry on a conversation due to the poor acoustics, the service was abysmally slow, and I left feeling like I needed to go someplace to eat a meal because both my palate and stomach were unsatisfied.  Not interested in going back.

(I will say the cheese curds were very good.)"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! My only complaint is a drink: They brought us a glass full of ice cubes with some liquid in-between. Basically, you pay for a glass of ice, not a drink, which, unfortunately, seems to be a norm at many restaurants in the USA."}
{"text":"Best lunch we've had on our Midwest trip! We loved that they source locally and without compromise to flavor and good service. The pretzel with three mustards and Wisconsin cheese was the best pretzel we've ever had- and we live in Philly! The Trout Nicoise with avocado is a must order if you're looking for something a little lighter but still satisfying and the cheese curds are squeaky good. Would return tomorrow if we didn't already have lunch plans:) Thanks, Graze!"}
{"text":"Along with several other reviews, I found Graze to be fairly nice but not quite living up to the hype.  

The space is beautiful but some of the seating is really awkward.  The service was a bit odd, but it seemed like maybe our server was new. She kept serially apologizing although she'd done nothing at all wrong. 

The biggest \"meh\" was the food, though. I had the Farmer Jon sandwich, which was fine, but despite an unusual mix of ingredients, really quite bland. The pesto mayo was more \"memory of pesto\" mayo.  I was disappointed that there wasn't something more interesting available for a side than salad or fries. The fries were extremely over done and smelled and tasted of fish.  Thankfully, it was at least a high-quality fishiness vs. some greasy cod fish-fry place when they have dirty oil, but still unappealing.

In short, it was perfectly nice, but not as cutting edge or as fabulous as I was hoping.  I'd go back, though, and hope this time they had fresher oil."}
{"text":"I'd like to like Graze more. Pros: Great location and atmosphere with buzz. The bar is a great place to meet for a drink. Cons: The menu simply doesn't work. Individual menu items are decent, but the menu doesn't cohere and it is difficult to put together a full meal. The menu works better for bar snacks than a full dinner. The reason for 2 stars is the exceptionally poor service. My first time there we were a part of 8- the servers brought all of the appetizers and mains at the same time, overflowing the too-small table, then refusing to serve us dessert because we ordered at 9:05 and desserts end at 9. The second time I was there, as a part of four, one of us asked for a fork three times. . .it never arrived so I got up and retrieved one myself. Two of four items ordered were prepared incorrectly. During my third visit, the wrong dish was brought to our table, left there, and then a waiter came and said that they were preparing the correct dish but if he left the incorrect one on our table he would charge us. My last time there, the waiter swiped my cocktail glass from the table before I was finished. The menu needs work and the staff need better training and supervision."}
{"text":"Graze is an amazing experience, with exceptional food at a great price.  Owned by the same people that own L'Etoille, possibly one of the best restaurants that I have ever experienced, Graze is very high quality and very well run.  I have never, ever had a bad experience there!"}
{"text":"U could have got a 5 star but the cupcake was neither a cup or a cake. But i loved my meal and my server and my view.

The atmosphere is perfect.  I loved the view of the capitol and the casual saucy vibe.  Our server knew everything about what made the fish sustainable and the market beef \"MARKET\". The fact that she was so informed but came across as less than pretentious was a plus one for me.   

My friend ann recommends the rainbow trout. \"it was amazing\" says her.

Just go there, its good, its smart and its jeezus good."}
{"text":"Harold's Chicken off Cermack.  My wife and I stopped after Cubs game for our first time and loved it.  Long time Chicago fan, never lived.  The Chicken was out of the world and the 2 workers were great.  Yes we had to spend time as the chicken was cooked. Many reviews bring this up. This means the food is fresh! We did not know what to reply with what kind of sauce would you like. Went with mild. Turns out mild is great. Walked to the Hyatt and ate. My only wish is sauce on the side and more chicken. Googled the Harrolds name & a store in Wi resulted. Hey, I work 5 minutes away. Review was crazy bad. Do not know if publisher is a moron or if the \"store\" is run differently. Love the chicken and experience. Will go again. Have wanted to eat Harold's long time."}
{"text":"I love this place. What a great restaurant
When I first moved to Madison I saw the restaurant and I thought \"Psht, Graze? I bet it's some pretentious vegan restaurant, I don't see me going there anytime soon\" (I know I'm a moron) 
I WAS SO WRONG! This place is wonderful! *and if you're like me, there are LOTS of meat options on the menu (and vegetarian options of course)
It's got a great menu (and drink list) and I've been back many many times since my first experience (they serve a fabulous brunch). Some of my favorite things to get there is the cheese platter (just tell your server what kinds of cheese you like and they will make some recommendations), the oysters on the half shell (because that is always a great option, and their carrot cake (I cannot believe it's vegan and Gluten free. I usually don't bother with restrictive diet options like that, but it is SO GOOD)
Their menu is always changing so I will make sure to come back sometime in the winter to see the surprises they have in store for me next. 
Highly recommended, one of my favorite restaurants in Madison"}
{"text":"Get the smoked tofu if you are looking for a delicious vegan meal!  I loved it!"}
{"text":"The ambience is superb, and I struggle to think of a place in Madison that has as much light and aces the \"clean and cool\" vibe. On a nice day, I love sitting there.

The food, though, is a mixed bag. I've had excellent things, but also things that taste no better than their cheap cafe or diner equivalent, despite the higher price and the fancy descriptions and ingredients. I have to rationalize that I'm paying for the ambience and vibe, not the food, or else it seems overpriced."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for their magic coffee and not for food or an actual sit down meal. 
Was recommended to give the magic coffee a try and it did not disappoint! 
It is an iced coffee that consists of coffee, espresso, cinnamon, brown sugar, half and half.  Not sure how they do it but it is absolutely delicious! As it is a restaurant (instead of a cafe/coffee shop), you can only get it when the restaurant is open (and how I wish I could get it every morning! :) )"}
{"text":"I have to eat at Graze every time I come to Madison for work. The cheese curds are the best I've ever had, the cocktails are amazing, and the mac and cheese is creamy and delicious. The veggie version of the bibimbap is also great. Awesome view of the capital. There's usually a wait, so plan to have a cocktail at the bar."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Madison. Great food and drinks, and the ambiance is splendid (especially at night). Remember to order the cheese curds here; I think they have the best cheese curds in Madison! :)"}
{"text":"Grabbed dinner there with my boyfriend.  I was pretty excited bc I've walked by plenty of times and thought the space looked really cool.  I guess I just felt underwhelmed about the experience.  The bartender was a little less than friendly, although the cocktail was pretty good.  We were seated in a table in a semi crowded area near the hostess stand.  The menu seemed a little all over the place.  I understand they were going for an upscale comfort food theme from the fried chicken and waffle and the meatloaf sandwich on the menu.  I got the steak which seemed like a decent enough deal at $20 and my boyfriend got some kind of Vietnamese sandwich.  The steak portion was pretty skimpy, they kind of feathered it across the plate so it looks like more than it actually is.  The sandwich my boyfriend got was cold and the bread was hard and stale.  I'd save your money visit Natt Spil down the street for a better meal at about half the price."}
{"text":"Have eaten and drank here many times, and there are a few good things on the menu. Get the regular burger, skip the Graze burger. Korean influenced choices are solid. Drinks are always solid. Bartenders are awesome, servers a little less attentive than desired, but they're very busy."}
{"text":"Great place with very friendly staff. The cheese curds were excellent with crunchy yet gooey texture.  The Graze burger packs a lot of flavor, However overall I found my dish to be on the salty side.  The fries has very good mouth feel, but had so much salt that I can't really taste potato. The schnitzel was quite oily. We waited for 1H15min for this meal, it could have been better."}
{"text":"Very good burgers, but the buns seems a little too \"toasty\" like almost burnt. The garlic aoli was the perfect combos for fries and even the burgers."}
{"text":"Stopped by just before 6:00 p.m. with my wife for happy hour Karben 4 Dragon Flute beers, pork buns, a pickle plate and mussels.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"Honestly? I was super excited to go here, because there is a general hype about it, but I was pretty let down. The service was nice, and our server was very friendly, but the food was just okay (hence only 3 stars). It really wasn't anything super special for the price point. You're definitely paying for the gorgeous capital view, so if you go, make it worth it by sitting by the large glass windows at the front of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Pretty interesting dishes - came a few times and was never disappointed. I tried the moules frites, the bibimbap and the kebab. All were great. I also tasted a cheese platter that was really good."}
{"text":"Peaceful, beautiful setting.  Great staff.  Totally delicious.  Inventive, locally sourced, healthy - yum!  Has everything you could want including the best cheese curds and fried pickles.  Best food in Madison!"}
{"text":"Great for \"grazing\" and sharing plates with friends tapas style. Great location. Entrees selection is small"}
{"text":"Have been to Madison only twice, but this my go - to. Farm to table deliciousness, an amazing cheese selection, knowledgeable and attentive wait staff, and great cocktails. Have sat at the bar and also at a table. It's open with huge windows and great views. They will have waits for busy times, but will text you when your table is ready so you can go for a walk, enjoy the farmers market, or grab a beer someplace else. Last night we had a cheese plate selected by our waitress, marinated beets, and Mac and Cheese. Last time we had their cheese curds and breakfast fair."}
{"text":"Yuuuuum for lunch, careful of the prices though, and don't go if you're starving. I came in knowing and prepared for the prices though so I was fine with it. Especially with those fried cheese curds. Man, those things are how cheese curds were meant to be. It's not on their lunch menu but you can get just a half order for 5$ if you want! Which is probably plenty for other people. I, on the other hand, could've eaten those fried cheese balls of heaven forever."}
{"text":"Just ok. 

This whole place seems somewhat contrived. The brunch menu is disparate and lackluster. The atmosphere feels a little too modern / cold for my taste.

First try:  we stopped for light dessert soon after they opened.  I wasn't a fan of the flavor used in the snowcone but maybe that's just me and hey, it's a snowcone.  The chocolate chip cookie on the other hand was extremely salty.  I understand that some people like it like that but I would have appreciated it if the menu had better described their cookie concept.

Second try:  brunch.  We tried the beet salad, nutella French toast and cheese board. All were decent, but the portions were small leaving us unsatisfied... particularly the cheese board. 

The service has been friendly and we appreciate the efforts to source food locally."}
{"text":"Amazing food.  Don't let the other reviews keep you away.  It is pricy, but you probably already know that.   You have to try the pork buns! I had the hanger steak and my wife had the salmon with clams.  Both really great.  I will be back.  

Nice selection of wines and out of the norm tap beers.

Update:  Went there a 2nd time. Still amazing food.  The beet salad is amazing, the views are great and the service is top notch."}
{"text":"If you enjoy over paying for mediocre food and horrendous service Graze is the place for you."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in Madison, my wife and I got engaged here. The chicken and waffles is always a good choice, but the mussels or the pub burger can't miss either. Great vibe and staff, the bartenders know their stuff. In short, go here!"}
{"text":"Loved this place.  We went here with my in-laws and my 2-year-old son.  Great menu, ambiance, and staff.  We will definitely go again when we're in town again."}
{"text":"This was a difficult review to write.  I am a fond supporter of L'Etoile and appreciate what they are trying to do with Graze.  But I think their focus got muddled somewhere along the way.  
For a gastro=pub the beer selection is sorely lacking.  Their wine list is excellent as always but the house cocktail options, while inventive, seemed limited as well.  
You can rest assured that any food you order from Graze will be the creme de la creme of it's respective variety of food.  Unfortunately the menu is held back by it's own inventiveness.  I can't say I'd want to come in for Bone Marrow every night and I'm not sure if there are enough staples on the menu to make up for that.  
I guess I feel that Graze went a little too high-class for a more open and affordable version of L'Etoile. 
I also dislike the interior decorating with some severe color clashing and an unbalanced mixture of modern and industrial design.  
But this was only my first visit and I may have been in a sour mood to begin with.  The Fried Chicken and Waffles was great and I'll definitely be back for another round.  It's just not the nightly spot I personally envisioned Graze would be, but I alone was not their only target audience. 

Oh right, I almost forgot the cookies and milk!  The baked-fresh chocolate cookies were amazing and I don't use that lightly.  They were  a perfect mix of chocolate & sea salt and made for one of the most satisfying deserts I've had in Madison.  Because of that I moved them to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Gosh, I so want to love this place. The magic coffee is, well, magical.The space is lovely and the staff is terrific. But the menu is lame, and so are the renderings of the few things I would want to eat. They try too hard to be clever or \"hipsterish\", throwing good culinary sense out the window.
For example, the burger. They manage to really screw this up to the point that I wonder if they have a vegetarian from some other exotic country who has never even had a  hamburger, much less a great one. A million dollar restaurant should be putting out a burger that people drive for 200 miles to eat. Their attempts at Asian food make me think they have a vegetarian from, well , the midwest, who has never tasted the way these things ought to taste. I come here from time to time to enjoy the wondrous space and am confounded by the utter lack of anything worth ordering, and when I do, I'm consistently underwhelmed by the flavors."}
{"text":"Went to Graze with a group of 8 to celebrate my birthday, it was 8:30 on a Saturday and we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table! It was a pleasant surprise.

I had the Hot Sugar Baby craft cocktail, a slightly spicy, not too sweet margarita, it was delicious. Everyone loved their drinks. 

As far as food goes, I had the Bibimbap with pork which was spicy, crunchy, and full of veggies-definitely crave worthy! Then fresh out of the oven cookies and milk to finish off the night.

Our server was very helpful and patient, and split up our check without a hitch.

Graze has great drinks, great food, and great service, not sure what else you could ask for!"}
{"text":"Excellent Madison restaurant. I had a Manhattan that was made very well. Tapas style dishes were very good. They made a mistake in my order but comp'ed the dish and would have brought me what I'd ordered also. Didn't matter, it was still great."}
{"text":"There's something about Graze. That is to say, both on the good and bad side.  L'Etoile's sister restaurant, Graze has a great pedigree and an identical commitment to local sourcing and top notch ingredients.  The menu is eclectic and there's something for everyone on it.  I'm not really buying its \"gastropub\" moniker. Graze is bright and sunny [floor to ceiling windows bright and sunny] like a farm cafe. Bar offerings seem peripheral rather than central to the experience, and I can't imagine going there after 10:30 pm or so. Both the Old Fashioned and Cooper's (right on Capital Square) and Natt Spil or Opus just off the square have cozier seating, more extensive drink menus, and zero pretension, making them far more appealing for a late night bite even if their food might not be on the same level as Graze (and I'd argue that Old Fashioned and Natt Spil both put out food that is on the same level or above what I've had at Graze). 

I often come here for lunch, and find the service at once overbearing and slow-- quite a feat.  Example from today's meal: \"How were your first bites?\" followed by \"Still liking your food?\" five minutes later... \"Do you need more iced tea?\"  two minutes later... \"Are you sure you don't want anything else?\" while I have a mouthful of food, then disappearing for 20 minutes as I anxiously peer around, needing a check so I can make it back to my office in time for a meeting.  There are some things I really like on the menu.  Magic Coffee lives up to its name.  Their slightly upscale take on fried cheese curds--phenomenal.  The deep fried pickles are kitschy and yummy.  All of their salads, while quite light for the price, are very tasty.  And I think their ramen bowl, which is made with Wah Kee noodles and served with a spicy chili oil on the side so I can make it as spicy as I want, is one of the best soups in town.  But other things on the menu (falafel po'boy, I'm lookin' at you) are completely lackluster.  Or they are inconsistent in taste/portion (something I've noticed frequently here).  Nevertheless, there's just enough good to outweigh the not-so-bad, so I keep coming here, and I think that once they settle into a groove as a fairly new (less than a year) restaurant, Graze will prove to be a favorite."}
{"text":"Everything they have said about the Graze burger is true. It is worth it :)"}
{"text":"Decent food in a nice setting, but it's kind of disingenuous to call it a \"gastropub\". It's neither pubby nor particularly epicurean. We sat at the bar, as we like to do, but it was just kind of a strange experience and the servers/bartender were awkward. I ordered the moules frites, which were actually very good, and I appreciated that there were no closed mussels in the bowl (major pet peeve). Fiancé had the pork bibimbap, which was somehow lacking flavor and the rice, formed into a brick and grilled, had a gluey, compressed texture. He liked his beers, but I was turned off by the wine. First, when I asked the bartender for a suggestion and said my only dislike was Chardonnay, he steered me toward the Chardonnay, which was the most expensive by-the-glass option at $15, saying \"It's not like other Chardonnays\"...ok...gave it a try and it was exactly like other Chardonnays. So I ordered a glass of Pinot at a more reasonable $8 or $9 per glass, and it was tastier but oddly warm. Like room temperature warm. The other bartender said that since they have a tap wine system, the wine just tends to be warmer than if it were in the fridge. Gotcha, but a) you aren't the only restaurant in the country with a tap wine system and yet others still manage to chill their wines properly and b) offering me a glass of ice cubes as a solution was just tacky. With tax and tip dinner ended up being in the upper $60s/lower $70s."}
{"text":"Amazing friend chicken and waffles. Nice ambience. Not too loud. Not too quiet. 

No reservations but the wait wasn't too bad. Good drinks across the way."}
{"text":"A romantic place for couples to enjoy their night. Kinda expensive, 2 people 40$ in total."}
{"text":"Graze used to be a normal restaurant where if you happen to have allergies or food intolerance, you could work around their menu. For some reason, this has all changed and this review should serve as a warning for those with allergies or who have celiac sprue. 

The first most annoying thing happens when you let your Graze waiter/waitress know that you have an allergy and/or celiac sprue. \"How 'severe' is your allergy?\" is almost always the response - as if they have been coached to ask this stupid question. I will like to point out here there are no degrees of severity when one has an allergy. An allergy is a an allergy. By letting your server know that you have an allergy or a food intolerance, it is an attempt to take good care of your health, and really, not an invitation to discuss the severity of an allergy. (And if I am going to take a chance and suffer the consequences of not following a restricted diet as I should be, that is my choice and my business and not theirs.)

Let's take another pause here. Why does one with allergies, et al, even eat out at all (or have the audacity to eat out, which might be your view, or more likely, Tory from Graze's)? Well, thanks for asking. As you can maybe understand, eating out creates a nice break from cooking at home. Cooking is a lot of work. It takes thinking, planning, shopping, manual labor, careful choosing of ingredients - and let's not forget the washing of pots and pans, and dishes afterwards. So, eating out every now and then is a very nice treat, and may even be inspirational for more cooking at home.

Back to my problem with eating at Graze, or any of the other restaurants of Tory Miller's. I have celiac sprue, which means I cannot eat anything with wheat, oats, barley, or rye. Eating any of these things will cause problems to my health. The only cure for celiac sprue is to not eat any of the things previously mentioned. In addition, I am allergic to nuts and peanuts - but we will talk about this a little later. Today, I went to Graze for brunch, not that I wanted brunch - but brunch is what it was to be. The only thing I could order on the menu was an egg scramble with a salad and potatoes, for $12. I really wanted the Chilaquiles - but I was informed that the corn chips aka tortillas are deep-fried together with the beignets. I mention to my waitress my allergy restrictions and then I order the egg scramble. Well, apparently, the potatoes are also deep-fried in the same oil as the beignets. I ask her if they can make the potatoes a different way - I don't need fancy. After all, if I can order hash browns at your less fancier restaurant than Graze - surely they can cook up something with your most simple food, a potato. Well, apparently, they cannot - even though they have a huge kitchen and are supposedly cooking food back there -  and they also cannot have a second and separate deep-frier for gluten-free foods - such as the corn tortillas, because really if one were to order gluten-free in a restaurant, ordering something with corn tortillas should be a no brainer - but seems to require brains at Graze (frying the corn tortillas with the beignets and the potatoes doesn't sound very tasty in my opinion, if you were to ask me). So, I ordered the egg scramble with an extra helping of the salad, which for $12 is not a sufficient substitute for the potatoes.

There really is nothing safe to eat on their menu if you have allergies - 95% of the menu has the potential to be contaminated in their wonderful kitchen in the back. 

Oh yeah - and the peanuts and my allergy to them, along with so many other people who have peanut allergies. Apparently, Tory is thumbing his nose at people with allergies and has absolutely zero compassion or understanding for people who suffer from them. He has the audacity to fry his food at Sujeo in PEANUT OIL! Yes, folks, peanut oil. 

Hey, Tory, you may think this is a new trend - as a restaurant, to not accommodate your customers however, it is not very alternative of you to blatantly have a complete lack of concern for people with disabilities (I am talking about allergies here, because at least for me, the consequences are disabling) as much as your mohawk is not alternative anymore."}
{"text":"Graze, you have outdone yourself.
What a great place for Madison first timers to get the royal WI treatment. Great place to grab a cocktail, sample an array of local cheeses (cheese curds, holla!), and seasonal dishes. 

I got the most refreshing glass of ginger ale to pair with their hot pretzel and pickle board. 

Pub Burger w/ beet-walnut patty
Attempted to satisfy my burger cravings while going veggie. I liked the beet patty, but wish I could've substituted the english muffin bun with something else.

Great vibe and great views of the capitol building at night. Definite repeat for me next time I'm in Mad-town!"}
{"text":"The best cocktail list in Madison- fantastic ingredients, creative, and catchy names- that seems to change every few weeks with the season. Probably has the best view as it sits in a glass box that looks at the Capitol.

Food is also great. Would like to see some more variety on the food menu like there is in the cocktail list; hasn't really changed since it opens. For that I would normally rate this place down but I can't in good faith when people are rating terrible nearby places with 4 stars as well that they don't deserve."}
{"text":"Overpriced, over crowded with hipsters, incredibly noisy and not the most fast or efficient service, limited menu and small portions. As I have mentioned in my other reviews of eating establishments Madison has within driving/biking/walking distance too many better options for a business that charges this much food to not bring their \"A\" game. Props though to the delightful all glass interior lord knows i love myself some natural lighting."}
{"text":"A visit to Graze is never a bad decision.

The locale on the square is spot on, service is always friendly, floor to ceiling windows make it feel bright and open, and the Sassy Cow cheese curds...best in Madison. Hands down. Get in my mouth. And don't bother arguing with me that the Old Fashioned does 'em better, I've already tuned you out. The batter is light, the cheese abundant and the house ranch that comes with compliments in the best of ways. I'd also highly recommend the Pork Buns, Fried Chicken and Waffle and/or the Bibimbap."}
{"text":"Fantastic staff, they are attentive and friendly.  Love the walnut beet burger, it's delicious!  Perfect place for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Great food, good atmosphere, just a little bit pretentious."}
{"text":"Whether I'm entertaining out-of-towers, I can't decide where to eat or I want some tasty local eats, Graze is my go-to. 

I've been going to Graze regularly since opening week and I've yet to have a bad meal. Lunch, brunch, dinner, happy hour and everything in-between Graze gets it right. Some standouts lately have been the perch fish fry, eggs benedict (my Madison fave), and the moules frites (be prepared to eat your weight in frites).

If you don't like to wait, get there early; Graze is POP-U-LAR."}
{"text":"Came in here for lunch and was not at all disappointed. They tick all the \"locally sourced, farm to table\" boxes which makes this bay area food snob happy. ;) 

Very nice space with a walls of windows overlooking the capitol. I had the Bibimbap with pork -- it was quite tasty; good balance of flavors and nicely spicy. Washed it down with a pint of Fat Squirrel and it all adds up to a worthwhile excursion!"}
{"text":"This place is great! The ambiance is excellent - you have great Capitol views and tons of light streaming in. The staff is super helpful (my water glass was never empty for long) and the food is creative and local. It's my favorite place to brunch In the city!"}
{"text":"Graze is a super open, bright and inviting atmosphere.  A mix of industrial and organic tones.  Very cool vibe to the space.

This, my 3rd visit, was a bit off from the previous in that the food was less the what I have come to expect from Graze.  It was a bit banal.  Pictures supplied. Scrambled eggs were over cooked and dry. The hash potato round was completely not crispy and unseasoned.  The English muffins whole grill marked were floppy and had an almost wet crumb.  While this is a pretty traditional plate, and it's mainly eggs and bacon, for the price and place there should be no white space visible on the plate... eggs and potatoes are cheap... make them right and cover the plate.  Just because the traditional breakfast is, well basic, didn't mean it should be boring and get less attention in the kitchen.  The Chilaquiles were on point presentation wise but were a dash over sauced which obscured the tortilla's add to the plate.  Great sauce... dash too much.

For an appetizer- the French Toast sticks for $9 were a big flop... 3 - 3.5\" sticks and side of hot ganache.  The sticks themselves tasted heavy in old oil perhaps... the burnt oil flavor over powered any intentions of maple in the batter.  The stick serving merely as a vehicle to get ganache from the plate to the mouth.  $9 is absurd!  Spying other plates exiting the kitchen - the more basic they were, the more underwhelming they looked.  Like the basic get based to the newbie as they don't matter.   That's how it feel and looks at least.

Service and attention were top notch - and way out performed the food today...  one off experience? ... not sure, but hopefully they aren't coasting so it's worth another visit on faith and atmosphere."}
{"text":"As an out-of-towner whose knowledge of Wisconsin is confined to the Mars Cheese Castle, (where you'd think there would be a king and queen, but nope, not even a prince) A&W Root Beer, (in the tall frosty mugs of course) and Culver's... this trip to the midwest is to discover some of the best the region has to offer (and to attend a wedding).

Upon the recommendation of a college buddy of mine that now resides in Madison, I decided to check out Graze.  With an impressive dedication to local sourcing and regional ingredients, this restaurant across the street from the capitol is clean, chic, and well-managed.

I checked in at the hostess stand and requested a table for two.  They did a good job managing expectations, let me know it would be a 30-40 minute wait.  We were seated in about 30 minutes.

We got a booth and were immediately waited on and served water.  Our appetizer order was taken right away since we knew what we wanted, a very good sign.  Our waters were never less than half filled and the service was impeccable.  Not too much attention, not too little.

Coming into Wisconsin, I had two must-haves, cheese curds and fried pickles.  This meal would satisfy both those cravings.

We started with the Fried Sassy Cow Cheese Curds, a quintessential Wisconsin food.  Deep fried and ooey gooey delicious, these vodka battered treats hit the spot after flying for 12 hours.

Then came the fried pickles, always a winner.  Although not spears, these were very thick cut chips, good enough.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#ybbedyV4NXfunWXFYd4QZQ

Other yelp reviews guided me to the seasonal punch.  This did not disappoint.  This season's concoction is peach mixed with Door County Vodka.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#ndQ7vK4Ilig01Tt0eNlnKQ

Next we had a taste of Korea in Chicago.  Wait. What. Korean food in Chicago? Dat don't make sense.  But it was pretty good.  I feel the regional ingredients really help this dish out (and a generous helping of kochujang sauce).

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#qEI2dTuN_t_7AbVR0wO35A

But let's be honest.  The star of the show here is the $21 Graze Burger.  Yes, you heard me right, I paid $21 in the midwest for a burger.  Ground bacon, sirloin, ribeye and short rib, with caramelized onions, a cabernet jus, a sesame seed brioche, and some fries. Daaaaamn this was delicious.  Call me a heffer, I will GRAZE on this all day.  Although the price was steep, best burger of my life.  Hand's down.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/graze-madison?select=TdlsFTsEr7nvA_er6k7Ebw#bxmvvO3M7cCWfgMaH_2kSw

A great way to start off #ChuggyEatsMidwest2013 on IG and Twitter.  Off to the next recommended eatery!"}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to going to Graze sometime for lunch, as their lunch menu peaked my interest personally a bit more than their dinner menu.  To start out with, you can't beat the view.  Graze has a great set-up inside and a wonderful view of the Capitol. 

I was in the mood for a burger that day and ordered their pub burger.  Overall, I didn't think that the burger or the fries were memorable.  I did order grilled onions on the burger and that added some additional flavor.  However, I would suggest ordering something more unique on their menu - my assumption is that something out of the ordinary is where Graze will shine."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Madison. 

There is always different seasonal options but nine times out of ten i go for the burger.  it is a bit pricey for a burger in Madison (21 bucks) but It is out of this world...especially when paired with a nice Cabernet Sauvignon.

The baked to order cookie is also amazing!!

The food is locally sourced and I always feel good about eating here.

The brunch is good as well but they don't change the items on the menu often other than the daily scrambles. The French toast stuffed with Nutella is very good.

The service has always been spot on.  Just last friday, my fiance made the mistake of ordering a beer without sampling it and the waiter insisted she replace it with something else.

Although you have to plan and be prepared for an hour+ wait for a table.....but it is worth it"}
{"text":"I had dinner at Graze on a Wednesday evening the week before Christmas, and the place was absolutely packed!  We put in our name and they took my cell number so they could send me a text when our table was ready.  The hostess also suggested we could visit Graze's sister restaurant L'Etoile just across the entryway for a drink at the bar while we waited for a table (which we did). 

We were seated right by the window and had a view of the capital building, which was beautifully lit up.  I got an appetizer of fried pickles - they were chips, not spears, and the batter was light and crispy.  I ordered the pulled pork mac and cheese.  The pulled pork on top was good, but the bites I had with just the mac and cheese were really the best.  Others at my table ordered burgers (the Graze Burger and the Pub Burger), they looked decadent and my friends said they were very good."}
{"text":"We chose Graze for dinner when we had friends visiting from out of town. It's such a classic Madison spot, it's hard to go wrong here. The location and view of the capital are of course excellent. The atmosphere is the perfect mix of lively and fun but quiet enough that you can enjoy an intimate conversation without straining to hear your company. My husband finally tried the Graze burger on this visit and I'm certain he'll be raving about it for awhile! He absolutely loved it and said it's worth every penny of the $21 price tag. I had a seasonal trout dish that was just okay, I would go with the classic mussels and frites or bibimbap next time. Bonus: They now take your number at the host stand and text you when your table is ready! We were able to enjoy a cocktail at Merchant while we waited for our table and it worked out perfectly."}
{"text":"First time visitors this last weekend.  I've heard good things and we finally decided to give it a try. 

It was busy and there was a 30-45 minute wait for a table.  Since going out to dinner for me means relaxing, not rushing and going with the flow the wait wasn't an issue and there were two open seats at the bar, perfect.

It took a minute or two for a bartender to come over, which gave me time to eye over the specialty drinks.  As a huge fan of gin, ginger and lemon - the sweet lou seemed right up my alley.  Unfortunately they were out of the ginger honey, disappointment.  I tried it with regular honey and not so impressed.  I'd like to try it again when they have all the ingredients in stock. 

Once seated at our table, the service was FAST.  We ordered the fried pickles, they came to our table faster than I was expecting.  We loved them!

I ordered the pub burger with a beet and walnut patty.  I've always been a little mixed on beets to begin with but as a vegetarian, I like to try new things.  Not my best choice, still not a fan of beets.  The beet flavor was too overwhelming for me, I took about half the burger off the bun and that seemed to really make a difference for me.  

We will return, I won't order the beet burger - but I look forward to trying some other dishes."}
{"text":"I wish I hadn't eaten at L'Etoile; my expectations were set way too high. The food was spotty (tasty egg dishes, overly salty salad, heavy beignets), but it was the service that was most disappointing. The wait staff appeared to have too many tables, as tables weren't turned over quickly, and there were long spells between refills or check-ins. The hostesses were probably the worst though; grossly inaccurate waiting time estimates, fibs about having called cells and a general unfriendly attitude. 

If I didn't know for a fact this was related to the best restaurant in town, I wouldn't believe it.

Updated for non locals: when I say related to the best restaurant in town, I am referring to L'Etoile, a Madison institution."}
{"text":"We had a really spectacular meal here for my partner's birthday the other week. We already can't wait to return.

Even though it was a Friday night and a little crowded, we were happy to wait for a table at the bar, enjoying two craft cocktails off the menu. Both of the drinks were excellent. I liked their system of texting when our table was ready.

For the meal, we went all out and ordered two appetizers -- the fried cheese curds and the deviled eggs. They were both delicious, especially the cheese curds. For the entrees, my partner had the steak and I had the pan-fried gnocchi. Both were incredible. We washed it all down with some Bulleit bourbon on the rocks, which was fairly priced. We were too stuffed for dessert, unfortunately!

Surprised to see others were underwhelmed by the food, we thought they knocked it out of the park -- and this is coming from someone very used to the excellent restaurants Chicago is filled to the brim with."}
{"text":"Been here twice and I just don't see \"why all the fuss?\" Many people want to blame my lactose and non-beef issue, but there are so many other great restaurants in Madison that easily remove those items, and I can still eat like a fat cat. I've been for both brunch and dinner now. 

Brunch - got the chicken and waffles - meh. The chicken was average breading and bland to slightly salt taste. The waffle was ok as well, nothing that makes me want to come back. But it did sustain my hunger for a couple of hours (portion size was decent).

Dinner - I ordered the beet burger b/c they couldn't even fathom changing out ingredients to fit my diet issues. I found this interesting from the restaurant of the top chef, in Madison, a foodie-wannabe town. They gave me a gluten free menu, and the only dairy-free (and gluten-free) items were beef or pork....or this horrible beet burger. So I got the pub burger, can't do beef, so a friend said the beet-walnut burger was good. Didn't like the sound of it, but gave it a whirl. So I've been a fan of walnut burgers every since I found the \"General Store\" in Kettle Morraine (south division). But this is not a walnut-beet burger.... this is a beet-walnut burger. HEAVY on the beets, and not that yummy vinegar soaked kind. All you taste is dirt, that earthy gritty dirt, like you just pulled the beet out of the ground and started chomping. I think the walnut in there is just to add thickness, but there was no walnut flavor that night. Even my friend who suggested it, ordered it, and wasn't a fan (that night?) either. 

I also tried the oysters - very good, and 3 different ones to chose from, although it took some persuasion to get my 1/2 dozen to be ALL one kind? (never had to argue for this). 

Tasted the bone marrow and pulled pork - bone marrow was goo, but the pork tasted nice - decent BBQ sauce, shredded good, but more sauce than pork (I come from a Q state and grew up on it).

Also tasted the mussel's sauce - spicier than I was expecting. Not sure if I had ordered that I could have finished it without taking a few breaks or a glass of (faux) milk! My dinner friend who ordered it said the mussels were cooked good. 

One other thing that bothered me and some others in the 9 person group: our group is split men and women, we haven't seen each other in a couple of months, we're all standing at the bar, saying our hellos, and then trying to get drinks. I wait about 5 minutes to get noticed and another 3-5 min to get the drink. I'm half way into my drink and my party starts moving around, grumbling. The host or someone had asked us to leave the area and wait in the lobby/hallway/foyer. We hadn't even had time to get \"rowdy\" (not that we are that type of group anyway)! The rationale: we were taking up too much space? We were as pressed against the bar as we could be, I was on the outside of the group, and there was still at least 2 feet from us to the person sitting at a table. Maybe this is a code, but the staff didn't give warning first? Here I am holding a $9 drink, knowing 9 x 9 = $81 (plus the few some of the early members had), thinking is this how you wanna lose money? the big group? really? Did they send someone to check on us? nope. 

The rest of the dinner group (8 others) were split about loving it or thinking it was \"eh, good.\"

Overall, not very friendly for large groups nor for dietary restricted people, unless you just love a plain ol' $21 beef burger? Only 2 main dish vegan items - the beet burger was one, and some darn hash is the other (the seasoning there comes from kim chee, which I like, but come on! a hash!?) Haven't been to a nice Madison place without a fish on the menu or ppl willing to work with the chicken item in a while. Sorry to those who love this place, but I won't be \"grazing\" there any time soon."}
{"text":"This was my first Gastropub and I was excited. The food was good and the service was excellent. Thank you Graze for making my experience in Madison so memorable."}
{"text":"The cheese burger with pickles is really delicious and hearty. The spread on the burger is similar to In-in-out's secret sauce....hmmm. Very good. We also got a cheese selection (which was okay) and cheese curds (of course!). All were very good. For drinks, I recommend the creamsicle with a shot of vodka... So good!!! The service was excellent too."}
{"text":"This place is pretty nice! I enjoy the view of the capital at night. It's beautiful. The food was delicious but the only downfall was that I bit into a nutshell for my main course and it was not a pleasant sound. I got an \"apology\" but that was it.... didn't even seem sincere. But I was being nice so I didn't make a scene or anything. I continued to smile. this place seemed good for families and bigger groups. There were a ton of seats available so maybe not a very large group. Service was decent and staff was decent. This place was okay in my book."}
{"text":"I've been to Graze a few times, mostly for lunch and have always had a fairly good experience. You tend to expect quite something when it's a restaurant that is run by the most famous chef in Madison. I've also been to the other restaurants run by him (Sujeo, Estrellon) and they've been great.
This past Friday, however, we decided to go there for dinner. We were seated right away, which was great, but the wait was crazy long. I'm not sure what the issue was. All we ordered was cheese curds and some burgers for the 4 people. When the food arrived over an hour and a half later, it was bland, my burger bun was extremely soggy and some of the plates were extremely hot (sitting under the heat lamps for a while I imagine). This was a very surprising experience, as the place wasn't even that busy. I definitely expected more of Graze."}
{"text":"Had to try Graze from a recommendation from a friend who was out on business as well previously. Three of us walked in on a Wednesday night and got a reservation right away even though the place had a good crowd. We tried some specialty drinks which were very good and also some wine. We shared the nachos to start which were very good. For entree's we had the burger, the chicken and waffles, and the macaroni and cheese with the pulled pork on top. We all thoroughly enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere. I will be returning my next time in town."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch. I'd heard a lot of amazing things about Graze, so I had very high expectations. I had the mac 'n cheese. It was alright, but not the quality I expected after all the hype. The waitstaff was very nice and the lunchtime atmosphere was good. I'd go back though, for sure."}
{"text":"I usually come here for brunch because they have the best Bibimpab Britto with affordable price. But I came here for dinner for the first time. Their cheese curds is phenomenon !! I would say its the best in Wisconsin !"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times. This past time we managed to sneak in and grab two seats at the bar before the rush hit. Started with the sangria it was delicious. I also got some pork buns. The one I ate had a bunch of bones in the mean which was frustrating because I had to take it apart to eat it. The other one didn't have any bones. It was very flavorful. I then got some Mac and cheese which was very good.  Some things on this menu are definelty overpriced. 21 dollars for a graze burger? seems a little bit excessive."}
{"text":"This could be the most overrated restaurant on the square. I ordered the pub burger with a salad, and shared an order of cheese curds with my friend.

The burger: It came served on an English muffin, which was unique, but not a good fit for a burger -- i.e., rubbery, tasteless, and flat. The patty itself was meager, and came very well-done rather than medium as I requested. The beef itself wasn't anything to write home about, though they wax poetic about its local, pure origins on a board on the wall. At $11, I'd also contend it's overpriced.

The curds:  I have definitely had better curds in Madison. Here again, I can't get over the $9 price tag. They were okay -- very greasy, like most fried curds -- and came with a slightly weird sugary dipping sauce.

My recommendation: skip the pretentiousness and try a burger at a bar called the Caribou on East Johnson."}
{"text":"Nice place! Try the graze burger.  It's one of the best I've ever had!  They have some nice unique drinks too. They have a focus on using fresh local food from nearby farms. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"This place had my heart as soon as I walked in the door. The open floor concept is super inviting, the staff is friendly and the food is outstanding. The Magic Coffee is a must order and the Bibimbap, with a choice of pork or tofu and fried egg on top, is not to be missed. You'll enjoy, no doubt."}
{"text":"I won't be back.

My friends and I went here for brunch.  For reasons we still don't understand, brunch service didn't start until 9:30 a.m.  No one actually told us that, though, and we were repeatedly told it would be \"just a minute\" while we stood around for 20 minutes.  We also had to get our own coffee.

The food was just okay - nothing we couldn't have made at home (Nutella-stuffed French toast and a Croque Madame).  The beignets were pretty bland.  Our waiter was really nice, but the rudeness of the hostess and barista kind of ruined the vibe for us by the time he came along.  

In short, the next time I want to serve myself coffee and eat this kind of food, I'll stay home.  At least the communication is clear, and it will be cheaper."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! Fried Chicken and waffles was amazing! Grateful for the great service and atmosphere! My wife had the fish and chips. She was very happy with that also! Great local beer selection also!"}
{"text":"Date night- anniversary edition! I've been told I need to go to Graze ever since I moved to Madison in 2012.  We almost didn't start on a good impression though. Once seated, it took nearly 10 minutes for a server to visit our table, even though it was early dinner hour on a Wednesday night. She apologized once she did arrive and made a comment about how she had forgotten to check her tables. For drinks, I got the strawberry rhubarb sangria, although the rhubarb vanilla lemonade sounded tasty as well. Husband got a standard beer. 
We ordered cheese curds and fried pickles as appetizers.  The dill dipping sauce for the pickles was okay, but the pickles themselves were pretty good. The cheese curds and the homemade ranch dipping sauce were very good! For a main entree, I ordered the mac with BBQ pork and husband got a burger. I though the mac was great- especially with the real cheese melted over it. The pork was tasty and added a sweet-ish note to the otherwise super cheesy dish. 
We definitely left feeling full and I took home my leftovers. Typically not a fan of how leftovers heat up and taste, but the mac and pork was just as good two days later!
I also have to give a thumbs up for the decor and the outdoor seating area. By the time we left, I had nearly forgotten my first impression and would happily come back here for brunch sometime!"}
{"text":"Oh Graze, how you disappointed me. As a foodie traveling with other foodies, we scoped out the Madison food scene prior to our work trip and pegged Graze as THE place we had to try. Glowing reviews, amazing location, an intriguing-looking menu...what could go wrong?!

Our party of 4 arrived around 6pm and the place was packed. We were given a 1-1.5 hour wait time. This place is tiny so waiting at the bar was not an option unless we wanted to stand over tables and hover on top of people trying to eat. We were given a pager so we went across the street to a dive bar called The Tipsy Cow (tip: go there instead! Great spot!) to wait. After an hour, we were paged so we returned.

The space here can generously be described as cramped. We squeezed into our small table and were consistently bumped repeatedly throughout the meal by servers passing through. The volume is loud here so expect to shout a bit while conversing. That being said, you cannot top the view: floor to ceiling glass windows overlooking the capitol building. Truly lovely and the best part of Graze for sure.

We started with a few small plates: cheese curds (of course), pork buns, truffle popcorn and soft pretzels. So, part of our quest was to try cheese curds everywhere we went on this trip and Graze is no exception. Where did they rank? Dead last. Our party unanimously agreed these curds were pretty nasty-- vodka batter served with house ranch and the flavors were horrific. We didn't finish the basket. First time!

The pork buns were paltry, basic and bland. I've had much better at a much cheaper price elsewhere. Not worth ordering as they are forgettable.

The truffle popcorn was a big miss. The basket remained full when the waitress took it away. We all took a single bite and found it to just be a misfire, plain and simple. While we appreciate the concept, the execution fails-- it's weird tasting ultimately and this feedback is coming from west coasters who hail from the land of putting \"nutritional yeast\" on popcorn at the movies voluntarily. We all felt its potential but it did not deliver. Do not order this.

The pretzels were very good. However, they are a very small portion so a party of 4 would need to order 2 of these. The pretzels were our group's favorite bite at Graze.

As for entrees, I ordered a fried chicken and waffles plate. I had big expectations, I cannot lie. Where I live in Oregon, we have a waffle food truck that makes this exact meal for $6 and it's out of this world, so going to a \"gourmet\" place to try their version smelled like nirvana. Sadly, 'twas not to be. First, the portions were RIDICULOUSLY HUGE. It was offensively big, honestly. WTF. Who needs that much food?! I wish I had taken a picture. I felt embarrassed having it front of me because I felt like a huge pig. So, despite the insane size, the chicken itself was black on the outside. Black. Beyond charred. Burned black. Ok, so it's going to be a carbon experience. Got it. Still, I plowed onward and cut into that black bird and found-- surprise!! Bone dry chicken! What a shock when it's burned black to have it be inedible and dry.  The waffle was subpar. Too big, too soggy, zero flavor. It came with syrup which I attempted to douse the food with in an attempt to get some sort of flavor-- maybe the syrup was the secret ingredient that pulled it together and made it come alive? Nope. I took 2 bites and couldn't eat another. My group all tried it and they agreed with me that it was just bad food, period.

One person with me ordered the pub burger, served on an english muffin of all things. He found it to be very average, questioned the $11 price tag and missed a decent bun. English muffin, while it's obvious they are trying to be trendy and different, ultimately reads kind of cheap, sorry.

Finally, one person got the trout and was very pleased, so that was a success at least. Drinks and service were also top-notch.

After our huge expectations and our disastrous results, we bailed on dessert-- we lost interest and we all agreed we wished we had stayed at The Tipsy Cow and gotten a bar burger instead. Overall, our experience with Graze was sadly disappointing and a huge letdown after we went in with such high expectations and excitement. None of us would return."}
{"text":"Decent place with a good brunch. The quality of the food is good but I feel that the menu is a bit boring."}
{"text":"Reliably good, expect a wait to eat here. Great place to take out-of-towners for upscale Wisconsin food, great Capitol view, good drinks and atmosphere. I recommend the bibimbap!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good burger. Unluckily, for work I'm usually solo and I cant bring myself to try something else. Luckily, I dine solo, so I can find a spot at the bar. It's popular at any time it seems. Have also gotten the burger to go. Bar service is attentive. Love the Cider."}
{"text":"Graze is such a fantastic brunch place; the large floor to ceiling windows make the restaurant oh so inviting and happy! Saturday brunch can be a zoo at this place (they don't accept reservations) but I've never waited longer than 20 minutes with a small group of people. 

I came here with my family for Mother's Day and we all really enjoyed it... The great thing about Graze is that it works for  all kinds of occasions - from a brunch date to family get together to an outing with friends. 

I ordered the loaded breakfast sandwich and loved it. The sandwich is loaded with an over-easy egg, ham, bacon, spinach, swiss cheese, brick cheese on honey whole wheat bread. It comes with greens on the side which were delicious in themselves - they were pre mixed in a really nice and lightly sweet dressing.  

Love this place and I can't wait to return to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice stop for lunch  between my friend and I we split two items: hooks grilled cheese, beet salad and smoked eggs for appetizer.
 The ice tea is delicious! 
Hooks Grilled cheese was made with gluten free bread as I requested and did taste fabulous.
Beet salad was very small salad the size of a side salad.
Smoked eggs tasted like bad rubbery tofu  was not good at all the only good tasting thing was the sauce over it that was was delicious. 
 Sad to say I did get very sick from that grilled cheese and so did my friend.

I might be back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Overall, a solid place. We were one of the first people in the door. The venue has beautiful high ceilings and smart decor. I particularly like the giant shelves behind the bar. 

The waitstaff were attentive and friendly. I wish I had gotten the name of our nice server. She was knowledgeable and had good suggestions without being too pushy. 

We started with the charcuterie plate. It was well flavored country style meats accompanied with delicious homemade pickles and a great ground mustard. The best of the three would be the duck terrine. I was surprised at how good the head cheese was.

For cocktails, we had 4: Marquez Collins, The Manhattan, The B___ (gah! Why can't I remember the name! It was an aperol white whiskey cocktail), and their seasonal punch. The drinks were overall good, but could use some work on balance. Considering the price and the reputation, I was expecting a higher level of attention to detail and execution. For instance, the collins had a hole-y ice which quickly watered it down and ruined the balance of the drink. The punch though was a surprisingly good flavorful drink, not overly sweet. Also, the garnishes could be cleaned up. The ends of the orange garnish on the B_ cocktail could have been cleaned up. 

As for the food, we had the pulled pork mac n' cheese and the fish fry special. The fish on the fry was very high quality and cooked perfectly. The batter was very delicate and fit the fish nicely. The tartar sauce was just fantastic. My partner, though, thought that the slaw was slightly under seasoned.

The pulled pork mac n' cheese was great order. While the pork was perhaps a bit too sweetly barbeque, the dish was really tasty. 

Our server also brought us the snack mix while we were waiting between orders. I highly recommend the fantastic wild rice puffs in it. However, there was some kind of 'stick' cracker that was so overly greasy that we just could not eat it.

We ended the meal with their snowcones. So cute! It was perfect end!

To sum, we will certainly come back again, but I hope that some of the details that hold this place back from a full 5 stars will be corrected by that time. It's a welcome addition to Madison, a place I'll return to with friends to have a few drinks and some light fare, but for the price it should try to rein in some of the unbalanced parts of the night."}
{"text":"We went to Graze for brunch on a Sunday morning with friends from out of town, excited to try the much anticipated menu items.  Overall the experience was good, the wait staff was supremely excellent, and the food was okay.

We waited awhile for a table for 4, upwards of an hour, but we were expecting that so it wasn't so terrible.  After we were seated we placed our order for deep fried cheese curds, beignets, 3 plates of Nutella stuffed french toast, and one plate of a breakfast sandwich.  

I personally 1. love Nutella, 2. love french toast, 3. love cheese curds.  The cheese curds and beignets came first.  The deep fried cheese curds were absolutely outstanding, currently sitting at the top of my personal rankings for deep fried cheese curds in Madison.  The batter was excellent, the curds were humongous, and the sauce clearly had some thought put into it.  Well balanced and tasty all around.
The beignets were yummy, but a little on the dense side and lacking in enough powdered sugar.  I realize this is Madison, not New Orleans, but if you choose to put something on a menu, I would expect it to be well executed.

Then the plates came out, 3 of which had the french toast topped with the seasonal fruit that happened to be apples.  This is where my cheese curd high fell and my \"meh\" face came out.  The french toast wasn't BAD by any means, but it was severely lacking in the Nutella area.  I mean, the dish is billed as french toast STUFFED with Nutella, but actual chocolatey decadence was hard to find.  It really was just a light smear of it on the inside of two very thick pieces of battered toast.  And the apples with smoked almonds were a bit overpowering for me.  I was disappointed that they chose apples to start with because the middle of May is not apple season by any means.  Hopefully that is strawberry season or maybe any other fruit that doesn't come into its glory during October.  I realize that the fresh fruit selection might have been sparse in May, but apples, really?  To top that off, I would have called the french toast overdone as the edges were borderline burnt.  
In the end, everything on the plate tasted fine, but it was lacking in polished execution which to be perfectly honest, was what I was expecting from a place so highly regarded.  For me, what sets a restaurant apart from another is its ability to do everything it serves to its highest potential.  And if that is even something as simple as bacon and eggs, then they should be cooked to perfection.  Graze just didn't hit the mark for me.  

However, the tastiness as well as the attentive and ever helpful staff is enough for me to try it again and hope for the best."}
{"text":"I love this place for ever reason. The décor is beautiful, fresh, and light. The view of the capital is great and it almost feels like you are sitting outside when you are inside because of all of the windows. They have chalkboards with the local produce, meat, and dairy for the week. Love it!
I've been there a few times for lunch now and have not been disappointed. The menu is a little eclectic with some America and Asian choices on it. I've played it safe so far, but next time maybe I will mix it up a little! 
I've had their grilled cheese with ham and it was hands down the best grilled cheese I have ever had. The caramelized onions and grainy mustard really put it over the top. Last time I had their mac and cheese with kielbasa. It looks like a small portion, but it is extremely filling and rich, I couldn't finish it. Also the best mac and cheese I've ever had... and the sauce on the kielbasa almost had a curry flavor to it which nicely complemented the mounds of cheese I was consuming. 
My only complaint - and I know everyone is saying exactly the opposite of me on here - but I think they are far from the best cheese curds I've had in Madison. They might actually be on the bottom of my list. There isn't a ton of flavor and some were even overcooked so all the cheese melted out. Don't hate me, but I'm not a fan of their curds! Order the deviled eggs instead."}
{"text":"Prices for a simple fried chicken waffle brunch were really high but the food was awful.  Dry,  uninteresting chicken and cold waffle and syrup.  I expected far better for $16. 
It took the kitchen ten minutes to heat up the syrup for the cold waffle.  Another adjacent table had a similar issue. 

 Time to start searching elsewhere for a new, trendy,  good eatery."}
{"text":"What wonderful place. From the massive windows with the incredible view of the capital building to the high ceilings the atmosphere sets it off. The food is all naturally grown from the state of Wisconsin and makes everything very fresh and tasty. They a short but good beer list and I enjoyed my first Spotted Cow. My friend and I ordered the homemade pickles for an appetizer which was a really interesting surprise and they were incredibly tasting. I also ordered the Graze burger which was so so good. Really enjoyed it. The wait staff was great and helpful and the food was fast. I'm big into the concept of fresh and local grown so I really like this place and it didn't hurt the food was great."}
{"text":"Graze is one of my favorite mid-upscale places to eat in Madison. The quality of their food and drinks is outstanding, and it is clear that a lot of thought goes into the menu. The cocktail menu has something for most tastes, and seems to rotate - the last time I was at Graze, all of the cocktails had Will Smith themes. Currently, they are all Shakespeare-related. Clever and fun!

I highly recommend the bibimbap for a twist on the classic Korean dish. The crisped rice cakes at the bottom are fantastic. Their charcuterie and mac and cheese with pulled pork are excellent as well.

No reservations and a modestly sized menu are the only downsides - if you are an extremely picky eater or in a hurry, you may want to save your Graze experience for a different time."}
{"text":"I was brought by someone who had been before. Being a group of 5 we had to wait about 25 minutes at dinner on a Friday night but the bar helped fill that time as we were able to get drinks and wait in the Lobby. Upon getting seated we got a cheese board that featured 4 cheeses. The local aspect of all the food is what I like best and the food I tasted was amazing. Definitely a place I will visit again and again when in Madison."}
{"text":"This is my favorite brunch spot in Madison. The seasonal cocktails are strong and fun. The cheese curds are my favorite in the city (sorry Old Fashion fans!). The dipping sauce the curds are served with is so good! The chicken and waffles is also a great entree to round out a fabulous brunch. 

They don't take reservations but have a great text message system that allows you to wander around the capitol or grab a drink else where while you wait for your table."}
{"text":"Great place to take out of town guests. You eat right on the capital and the waiters know the menu like a play script. I had the bibimbap which was delicious, and I had enough to take home as left overs!"}
{"text":"Well, this is my first review on Yelp; however, I've dined at many of Madison's local restaurants since moving here 4 years ago. I had heard very little about Graze before dining there on a Tuesday night. Esthetically, the space is beautiful. Some won't love the street exposure and the boomy acoustics, but it worked for me. Going to a new restaurant, I tend to be very forgiving of most things. I don't expect food to come out expeditiously, I don't expect service to be 100% and I don't even expect the food to be 100%. I'm always willing to give a new restaurant a second and usually a third chance. I will give Graze a second opportunity, but wanted to share my experiences. We were graciously welcomed into Graze, but from there things really went downhill. 

For appetizers we order the pretzel and deviled eggs. They took forever to come out- but were acceptably tasty. My friend then ordered a Cosmo- which the three of us at the table agreed was pretty harsh. We brought it to the attention of our server who proposed \"adding cranberry juice,\" rather than simply acknowledging that it wasn't acceptable and making a new drink. From here this left a pretty sour taste in all of our mouths. Glasses of wine were served at what I would roughly estimate at 6oz- which is fine if that is the standard practice at Graze. Other tables seemed to get a more generous serving which is disappointing if there is not consistency. While I'm happy to pay for a wonderful (small) drink amidst an otherwise great experience, I was unwilling to order a second or third glass of wine at $9 a glass for a 6oz glass of wine and huffy service. I ordered the Bahn Mi sandwich; it was nothing special and was served with an unappealing mountain of fries (not listed on the menu). I get that this is a 'gastro pub'- but if I want fries I will order them. The Bahn Mi pales into comparison to the Bahn Mi served by the Mermaid Cafe on Willy Street.  My friends seemed equally unimpressed and kept sharing the comment that the Old Fashioned had better food that was less expensive and better drinks that were less expensive. 

If the service had been even slightly better, it would have been easier to overlook the questionable menu choices that we made. We did ask for guidance from our server- but got little help. Additionally, the cheese curds were not available and we were not informed of this until we placed the order. 

When my friend asked for recommendations on what was recommended for the preparation on his burger, the server fired back with, \"Well, how would you normally order a burger.\" Really??? 

A few in the room were ordering the cookies with milk after dinner. I would have loved to try it, but was already annoyed that we had already spent so much and recieved so little. 

Graze, we will be back. But not for a couple months. I hope and want you to be successful- we need outstanding restaurants in Madison in outstanding spaces. Tonight, we felt like we would have received better service at a TGIFs. 

I rarely tip less than 20% in Madison. Tonight, we struggled to justify a 10% tip."}
{"text":"Madison is a town that takes breakfast and brunch quite seriously. So seriously in fact that when my partner and I tried to go Marigold Kitchen one morning around 9:30, there was already a line out the door. We were both pretty hungry already so we started walking around to scope out other options. There were only a couple people in Graze so we decided to check it out. The place did start to fill up pretty quickly after 9:30 though so plan accordingly. 

I had woken up that morning with a fierce hankering for hash browns so we ordered those to share. My partner got the breakfast sandwich and I ordered the chilaquiles. The hash browns were actually the most disappointing part of the meal. The hash browns themselves were fine but they came topped with some cheese that had congealed and made the entire dish rather salty. The main dishes were great though - I had a bite of the breakfast sandwich and it was luxuriously rich and delicious. My chilaquiles were a tad salty but still really yummy. I was really pleased to sw chilaquiles on the menu too, since I'm from California and some of my breakfast joints back home carry it but I haven't seen it on the menu a lot here in Madison. Definitely want to come back for dinner sometime. 

I've also been here for cocktails during brunch time - my friends and I both got the Pamplemousse cocktail and it was great with a side of cheese curds. Service here is always attentive and excellent and the view of the Capitol is amazing."}
{"text":"The selection of 14 cheeses was quite intimidating. It would be helpful to offer a cheese selection platter."}
{"text":"Beautiful space. The seasonal punch I had was made with raspberry and pear puree, raspberry-infused vodka, and almond-infused something-else. Delish! My friend and I shared the pork buns, beet salad, and moules frites. The pork buns left the strongest impression with me, because they had nice pieces of fatty pork belly. Yum! Not your typical pork pot-sticker-style buns. The beet salad was fine (pretty standard), the mussels were in a yummy broth, and the fries came with a nice mayo-aoli-kinda dipping sauce, though the fries themselves weren't the best I've had."}
{"text":"My husband and I try to stop here whenever we are in Madison for the week. They have items that suit our young son when he is with us and they have items and suit our tastes as well. The service on the several occasions that we have gone has been great but I don't believe we've ever gone on a particularly busy day."}
{"text":"Loved this place; went around happy hour and sat at the bar.  I ordered the Green Hot Chili Peppers cocktail and my friend got the Limp Hibizkit.  Both were delicious!!  We also ordered the cheese curds (HIGHLY recommend) and the Kimchi deviled eggs (also delicious).  I found the staff to be a little on the less-friendly side...not rude by any means, just not overly friendly like you may expect if you were sitting at the bar.  The restaurant itself is a great place, loved the decor and the featured products menu on the walls.  Would definitely suggest as a place on your trip to Madison!"}
{"text":"Tried this spot for brunch on Sunday, I hadn't been there since an unimpressive visit about a year ago. The bibimbap breakfast burrito is one of the best brunch dish ideas I've seen, and it delivered. Crispy rice as advertised, spicy without sacrificing flavor.  All constituent parts were cooked perfectly and held up in combination.  I will be back more often."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing! Looking for a great date night, this place is perfect. The cheese board was our favorite! Then we shared the vodka battered cheese curds.... Um- yes please!!!! And then split the famous GRAZE burger. That too was AMAZING!  
I washed all this amazing food down with their seasonal punch (Rhubarb/Rum combo).
Atmosphere was fun... Sat out on the patio and enjoyed people watching of the people coming and going to the state capital. Great place!!! :-)"}
{"text":"My husband and I had brunch at Graze this morning. The place sort of feels like an Apple store, but I'm glad we ignored that and went anyways. We shared cheese curds, the bibimbap burrito, and the fried chicken and waffles. It was all fantastic, as was my cappuccino and the Pample Mouse Aperol cocktail. Seriously amazing. I can't wait to visit Madison again so I can get that bibimbap burrito."}
{"text":"Just had a really excellent dining experience tonight at Graze. I graduated myself from UW-Madison exactly 42 years ago. There were very few outstanding restaurants in Madison then. We came into town from Los Angeles for our son's graduation and what a way to start our celebratory weekend!My seared trout on bok choy was delicious. My son loved the mac and cheese and the fish fry was not ordinary. The rustic apple pie with buttermilk ice cream was to die for. The atmosphere is so relaxing and beautiful. I dont know when we'll be back in Madison now that our son is graduating. At least I'll have good memories of Graze."}
{"text":"I'm a celiac and have to go for the gluten free options. Because of that, my review can only reflect those items on the menu. 

First off, the atmosphere and location I feel are the best things going for the restaurant. Great view of the capital in a hip feeling environment.

The service is friendly and professional. They don't just hire people off the street. Everyone from the host to the bartender to the chef know what they're doing.

As for the food, which is the most important part, this is where I feel the restaurant lacks. The sides are basic and uninspired. The entrées leave you wanting. I wouldn't describe the food as \"bad\" but it is in no way noteworthy in my mind and there are better options for each menu item scattered throughout Madison. 

Specifically, their gluten free breads, though made in house, are behind the curve. Though ten years ago expectations for those kinds of food were low, better breads have made their way to the market. Their buns were dry, flavorless, and somewhat mysterious in consistency. Definitely did not taste like the GF breads I eat at home.

Overall, this place is worth the experience. Their prices, despite the talk around town, are not unreasonable. However, I would not call this a choice destination for someone looking to eat gluten free."}
{"text":"Location and reputation is what brought us here for dinner. Ordered steak and fries and it was the worst steak (if you can even call it that) that I've ever had in my life! Couldn't of been more than 4oz's and literally hard as a rock. I should of sent it back but didn't...too long of wait to get meal in the first place."}
{"text":"Great spot for Brunch! Food is excellent and service was fantastic. Not much to say as they're food says it all."}
{"text":"Effing delicious. Seriously, brunch here was the best meal I've had in ages. Everything is fresh and local - a lot of what we were ordering literally came from the farmer's market across the street. There's nothing like fresh ingredients to make a delicious meal, but clearly there was also skill involved in creating my beautifully fluffy omelet and the delectable hash browns that accompanied it. 

Hands down, though, my love for Graze runs extra deep thanks to the best breakfast item I have ever seen on any menu - deep fried cheese curds!!! The best part is, in this light, airy, modern space with floor-to ceiling windows and a view of the majestic Capital and the bustling farmer's market, I was just about able to convince myself that fried cheese is health food. Now that's impressive!"}
{"text":"We are generally big fans of all Tori, Traci  & crew's ventures. We stopped by for dinner on Saturday night of opening weekend and enjoyed our meal at the bar. 

We tried several drinks and really liked what we had including the Rhum Fire and Seasonal Punch.  For dinner we had shared the beet salad, mac & cheese with pulled pork and the croque madame sandwich and all were very good - but I think the croque madame stole the show... And we split a piece of the banana cream pie for dessert .

Another person at the bar shared a sample his fried cheese curds with us and they were exactly what you'd expect fried (local) cheese curds from the L'Etoile crew to be - heavenly.

The space is lovely, light and modern without being pretentious. It's amazing they pulled it all together (seemingly) so fast!

The only issues we noticed were (1) the menu layout was a bit hard to follow; (2) there seemed to be a sunshade (or two) missing from the side windows (but it appeared they were well-aware of this problem); and (3) no purse hooks under the bar (while not a necessity, certainly an added bonus). 

We plan to be back, hopefully often!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious! Not only is the food amazing, the quality of the food is unbeatable. And in my opinion, the BEST cheese curds in Madison! Get a half order, they're amazing!

The location is amazing. The restaurant has tons of windows and glass, and the seating outside is beautiful. 

I got the pork BiBimBap which is a tad different from bibimbap I'm used to. The rice comes in blocks of crispy rice that is very dense. Honestly, not my favorite, but the other ingredients were good!

My friend got the Graze Burger and loved it, though he said it wasn't worth the price. The fries are DELICIOUS and I definitely recommend them.

Another friend got the Mac and Cheese which was incredible. Light, creamy, flavorful. 

Service was great, food was amazing, menu had so many different choices. It's pricy, but worth it. Definitely go here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Madison!  In this city I like to judge a restaurant by its cheese curds, and these are the best I've ever had.  As far as entrees go you really can't go wrong, everything's good.  The floor-to-ceiling windows really light the place up in the day and provide awesome views of the capitol at midnight.  Definitely a place to check out if you haven't already."}
{"text":"They're only getting 2 stars because they're new. 3 friends and I were disappointed at a few things. Before I get to that,  I must say the trout dish was amazing. The other 3 entrees we had all disappointed.  My Bahn Mi sandwich was very salty and was more like an expensive ham sandwich. I don't think there was any hot peppers or spice in it. (Been to Laos and Vetnam so I know what they're supposed to taste like).

The $19 burger (contrary to a recent Cap Times review) is definitely not worth it.  My friend said it was OK but you can get much better for 1/4 the price elsewhere. If you're paying for the great view, then $15 is for the view.

The collard greens ordered as a side were so salty, we couldn't eat them.  And the waitress was horrible. She didn't bring water when asked twice and lost someone else's credit card and asked us if we had it. Sheesh. OK, bad night for her but given the prices and only 1 good dish of 4, I'd say wait 6 months to try this place out. Maybe they'll ease up on the salt and get better trained staff. Our waitress didn't have the small menu memorized and didn't know the specials offhand.

Finally, we started out making fun of a review we read who said the space is too loud. We thought they were being snobbish. But after 5 minutes, we agreed!  Our waitress could hardly hear us. There's nothing to absorb the sound, so It's way too loud for a romantic place, or even a dinner conversation.  Other than that, the space is beautiful with a great view. Maybe this would be better for a drink or 2 before dinner somewhere else."}
{"text":"Terrible waitress, the whole time she kept telling our table of 10, (we were seated in the bar area during happy hour) I have a group reservation at this table at 6:30pm. She started telling us at 4:30pm and kept telling us!!! Oh and let's not forget she ignored us the whole time. I joined my friends at 5pm and ordered my glass of wine at 5:15pm (yes she told me I needed to leave before 6:30). At 5:45pm she asked me if I would like another glass (it was two for one) yes please. At 6:10 she was trying to rush us out and I asked for my bill. While she gave me my bill she asked if I had white or red for my second drink!!!! I said well you took my glass 20 minutes ago and never brought me my second! Happy hour was not happy for our group!
Maybe the bar area with the two tables should be saved for guest who just want drinks and h'orderves???"}
{"text":"I'm sorry Graze. I love your food but my most recent experience with your server has forced me to downgrade my love for you. And probably not return for a long time. 

I did not get the name of this said male server but I had the unfortunate experience of being unattended for such lengthy periods of time (this has never happened at any of my other experiences at Tory Miller's restaurant, or any decent restaurants). I had to request the help of other servers/hosts at least 3 times to locate where my server is. He just disappeared. And every single time he appeared he was in a hurry. To disappear again, probably. 

I enjoyed my cheese curds and kimchi burrito, however I wish there were smaller portions of both. Even sharing half with my boyfriend didn't stop me from feeling overloaded after the meal... The cheese curds seemed a tad salty after half a basket of them but still love the melty cheese! 

Yeah.. Be warned, come unhungry and be prepared to wait if you get said unfortunate server. Sigh, what a misfortune. One of my favorite local restaurants have to be tucked aside for the next few months."}
{"text":"I had the smoked beet salad, which was made with Door County tart cherries, radicchio, some orange pieces, and roasted walnuts.  Also tried a non- alcoholic drink called a rhubarb rise that was terrifically refreshing.  They have a special annotated menu that tells whether each item can be made gluten free.  I appreciate that the waitress asked me if I needed my food prepared separately for allergy concerns.   I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Very good. Upscale crowd and prices reflect that but still food very good."}
{"text":"I love both the food and the drinks at Graze.  I'm sure there are heavy things on the menu, but I always seem to get things that are light but satisfying.  The beet and walnut burger is great, and I also really like the fried pickles."}
{"text":"I go here every time I have a business trip in Madison. Atmosphere is great and it's walking distance from all things downtown. It's farm to table and they assure you that their cows are happy :) 

I got their steak with sautéed spinach, onion jam and scalloped potatoes. I highly recommend. Their menu tends to change based on seasonal availability but they always have one steak option. 

My only complaint for most places in Madison are the timings. Their downtown is not as lively as most places so restaurants tend to close early or be closed entirely on certain days. Make sure to check before venturing out."}
{"text":"In Madison for a conference, I was enticing into Graze for lunch by the modern glass building and the appealing menu.   Their food is all locally sourced, and the building is pretty cool on the inside--all glass walls. They also have an outdoor patio. I tried the blueberry homemade lemonade ($3) and the Italian beef and cheese sandwich ($11) with cheese curds (add $2). Everything was fantastic and tasted really fresh. Service was awesome too. The only complaint is that for $11, the Italian beef and cheese was pretty small (about half of what I was expecting). However, the cheese curds were wonderful. 

Pros: locally sourced, fresh food, great cheese curds
Cons: sandwich was a little small"}
{"text":"Came for dinner with a friend. Had a drink at the bar first.  All the cocktails on the menu have great names.  First table we sat at had a terrible draft from the vent on the floor.  Felt like a wind tunnel, but the server quickly and nicely moved us to another table near the windows.  The couple at the next table said they had just done the same move.  Recommendation: charcuterie tray is fantastic.  You can choose different cheeses and meats, the condiments and breads were superb.   For the main course, we tried the Friday fish dinner.  This was disappointing.   The fried fish was placed on top of the fries in a basket, leaving all of the fries really soggy.   The fish was ok.  I would have been happier with a second round of the charcuterie tray instead."}
{"text":"If this place didn't get so much hype, it might creep into 4.5/5 territory. The only knock on it is that it's not worth the wait if you happen to be there when they're busy and any of the other cool restaurants nearby have availability.

Their cheese curds are the truth. 

The chicken and waffles entree lives up to its buzz about town.

Awesome space looking out at the Capitol."}
{"text":"This spot became my go to place when i am at Madison Wisconsin. Perfect view, good beer selection and diverse menu. I had the best sandwich and tomato soup ever. The service was quick and professional, the bartender was very attentive. I will definitely recommend it and will go again."}
{"text":"Good spot around the capital that aims for upscale food quality (all beef is grass-fed, everything is like free-range organic) and inner decor but with a casual vibe and no pretension. Glass-wall design is conducive to this -- gives you an outdoorsy feel without your having to be outdoors. 
Dishes are all superb with some creative quirks thrown in -- for example, Korean kimchi and bimimibiap (sp) mixed in with traditional dishes. As a burger freak, I had one of the grass-fed burgers and thought it was great, and I admired the creativity with the breads (serving it on an English muffin.) There's a reason I've been back.
Tends to be a longer wait, especially on weekends, so go when you don't have a ton of work due on Monday, etc."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.

Came here for lunch at about 1:30PM, so it was pretty empty. First thing you notice is the extremely white and sleek decor; I thought this place was like a tech company or something when I was walking in. The staff is really attentive and nice; after reading some of the other reviewers I really don't understand the problems with the service. They have cute little water pitchers and tall, skinny glasses so you never have to go thirsty but you can still have water in a reasonably formal manner. It's a little bit pretentious, I admit, but it worked for me.

I got the gazpacho soup of the day with toasted bread and goat cheese, beet and walnut burger, and cheese curds. How did a carnivore like me manage to order a vegetarian meal? I have absolutely no idea upon reflection, but whatever; it was all good.

The gazpacho soup of the day was good at best on its own, but that goat cheese was absolutely heavenly; and I've had my share of goat cheeses. Perfect for the warm day that it was.

Who would've thought that the star of the meal was the cheese curds? Not me. But those cheese curds were better than Old Fashioned cheese curds; and that's saying something. Graze cheese curds are massive. There's just something about the bigger size and tangy dill sauce that kept my mouthgasm going on for a lot longer and repeatedly.

That beet and walnut burger also had some serious flavor. The patty had a surprisingly pleasant texture that definitely didn't really remind me of a normal burger, but it was sweet and fragrant while not being overwhelming. To be honest, it almost acted like a buffer between the other flavor explosions in within the burger. My only complaint was that the bun was loaded with grease (from what, even?? It was literally veggies, some sauces, and the patty), especially the bottom. Oil? I can tolerate, especially in a veggie burger. But having to hold the bottom bun coagulating not because of watery juices, but from oil, definitely took away from the experience.

The prices were also a touch high here. That walnut burger (alone) would probably have been more appropriately priced at $9, and the cheese curds a dollar or two lower.

But overall, a really solid place. Come if you're in the vicinity. Good food, good flavors, good ambience, and good service, for high-ish prices."}
{"text":"When I think about some of my best dining experiences, Graze immediately comes to mind. It's definitely a restaurant that you want to go to if you have a lot of time to make an experience out of it. If you don't take your time here, its not going to be completely worth it.

My friend and I only had to wait about five minutes for a table at about 6:30 on a Wednesday night. The view was great...right in front of the lit Capital, with a really nice open, yet cozy atmosphere. We started with a bottle of white wine (and ended up having to put the ice bucket on the floor, which was kind of weird...I understand the table was small, but it was strange to have our $35 bottle of wine sitting on the floor), and the cheese curds, which I highly recommend. The homemade ranch sauce was excellent...definitely not overall what I was expecting, but now all cheese curds will have to go against these. Trust me, all the others will lose. 

Not being able to decide, my friend and I chose two entrees and split them. We went with the Warm Farro Salad and the Graze Burger. I started out with the burger...and well, you really can't call this much of a burger. This isn't just some ground beef you're going to find anywhere, it's freshly ground sirloin, with the most amazing texture and flavor. The carmelized onion adds a bit of a sweet flavor. I have literally been craving this burger ever since I had it...yes, its worth it to treat yourself to a $20 burger every now and then.
The Farro salad was also excellent...it was surprisingly light yet savory, with squash and mushrooms. It definitely makes for a good meal on its own. 

I also am a fan of knowing where my food comes from, and I feel like Graze isn't treating this like its some sort of gimmick.

My only hold-back from giving this place five stars would be the service...which was okay, but not great. The waitress didn't come back terribly often, and it took a really long time to get our food. Like I said, this is the kind of place you want to have a lot of time to spend at to make the experience worth it, so don't try to make this a quick stop."}
{"text":"Had a pretty odd experience at Graze. My boyfriend and I decided to give it a try for brunch. Food was only ok... We arrived not long after opening and were seated at a great table outside. After an unusually long wait for coffee, our server came by to explain specials. She provided a lot of detail about the way food was being prepared that day, including a side of fruit with fresh raspberries, blueberries, and Door county cherries. We though that sounded great and ordered it along with our meals. Round one, we had to send the berries back due to moldy raspberries sitting right on top. Round two had no mold, but the bowl was sticky with fruit on the outside (I'm pretty sure someone just picked out the mold) and several of the blueberries were shriveled and inedible. I ignored this but did ask the server if I was misremembering that there would also be some door county cherries, to which she responded \"yes, that is frustrating\" and brought the cherries a little later. All of this is understandable but the issue is how the restaurant reacted... the unreal part of this little saga is that the restaurant did not take the $6 tiny fruit cup off of our bill. Just a little thing that would've gone a long way!"}
{"text":"Graze sports an affordable and local menu that is done well and changes often. Beautiful view on the square too."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and absolutely loved it both times.

I always have a super hard time deciding what to get because everything looks so good, and to make it harder everything I've actually tried has been amazing. 

Items I've had include:

-Cheese Curds (not quite on par with the Old Fashioned's but very close)

-Mac 'n Cheese w/pulled pork

-Pub Burger

-Cheesecake

-The Marquez Collins cocktail (or the Marques Colston as my friends and I enjoy calling it)

-Really Magic Coffee cocktail


Considering the location and menu the prices are very reasonable (though you can ring up the bill pretty fast with those cocktails).

On top of all that the atmosphere is awesome, especially at night when you can look over Capitol Square. And while the wait is usually a bit long (30-45 minutes) you can usually find a place at the bar and hang out there in the mean time. Service is good too, everyone seems really friendly and helpful in explaining the menu and checking on you throughout the meal.

In sum, it's a great place to go to dinner with friends. Great view, great food, tolerably priced, and unlike its neighbor/partner L'etoile, you can actually feel relaxed while you're there and not feel self conscious about belting out in laughter."}
{"text":"Graze is amazing. I've never been disappointed in the food. The cheese curds are a must. Their menu is seasonal so you know the food will always be fresh. I brought a vegetarian friend and she was able to find a few options to choose from. 

I've been for brunch and late dinner and didn't have to wait long for a table at either time. It's also not insanely overpriced. 

The atmosphere is lovely and the views of the capital can't be beat."}
{"text":"While we were in Madison, we kept walking by this restaurant and decided to check it out.  So glad we did!  We had an amazing meal!  We started with the cheese curds, that were hands down the best we have ever had!  Also had the bread basket and a couple of cocktails. For dinner I had the pappardelle pasta and hubby had the Graze burger. One of the meals we have ever had!"}
{"text":"Love the farm to table concept. Good food.  Great quality.  Nice atmosphere.  Super close to the Capitol."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place for its flawless combination of hipster atmosphere and locally sourced quality.  
Graze is located in, arguably, one of the most unique dining set-ups on the Square featuring two walls of windows and an indoor/outdoor seating area in the warmer months.  I definitely recommend making reservations for this place, even if you don't think you need them. 
 I wish I could suggest just one entree, but their menu changes a bit seasonally, and I have never been disappointed by anything I've ordered.  A good staple? The Graze Burger; local, Highland beef topped with bacon, on an english muffin, finished off with the works. It is *delicious*.  Also be sure to check out their craft cocktails, which are creative and exceptional, and their cheese curds! Ooey Gooey perfection in a housemade vodka batter and curds from a local creamery.  
If your goal is to experience a new (and amazing) restaurant without breaking the bank; check Graze out for lunch in lieu of dinner. They still offer most of the same options, and a lot of things are scaled down in size (and price)."}
{"text":"The popcorn is unreal. Seriously, I eat it so fast that my jaw starts to hurt. They have a wonderful take on the bimbimbop- it has this amazing crispy rice that I dream about. Their deviled eggs make me the happiest girl in the world. Oh! And did I mention they have gluten free cookies and milk! Yes, gluten free cookies and milk. I thought I died and went to heaven. They have the best food and such a great view. Must go in Madison!"}
{"text":"Went on a date night here with my boyfriend and it was incredible. Food was absolutely delicious. We get cheese curds everywhere we go and these were by far the best. Food was great, service was great, view of the capitol at night was great. The prices are actually relatively cheap for the quality of the food. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Graze's food is as good as it gets. I've never gotten something I didn't like any time of the day. My favorite item on the menu is their breakfast bibimbap burrito. Oh, and their cheese curds. I would argue they are better than the Old Fashioned's famous curds. 

The only downside, is the wait. There have been several occasions where the time quoted is much shorter than how long it takes to get seated. The texting system doesn't always seem to work. Really wish they took reservations, but if you've got time (and money)... the food is worth sticking around for."}
{"text":"Tried it again...same disappointing experience as before. Slow service and substandard food. I don't understand the hype."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now and it is always a great experience. The Magic Coffee is a must! All of the brunch items look delicious, you really can't go wrong. The beet salad is also pretty much amazing, and I am not a beet lover at all. I've only been for breakfast but plan to go back for dinner sometime! Service is always fantastic. 

 One negative- the cocktails are overpriced. $8 for a bloody mary is a little steep no matter how good it is."}
{"text":"Great drinks and terrific food. The best cheese curds in town. The mac and cheese is amazing."}
{"text":"My favorite place to dine in Madison! Excellent food, great atmosphere and the best cheese curds in town!"}
{"text":"Have never gone wrong at graze- live very close and frequent there, especially for their great happy hour. The only bummer (but also slightly very fun) thing is that they have a seasonal menu- so when you have something amazing (and almost everything is!) it will pretty much likely be gone the next time you  are gone. Definitely go ."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place. Beautiful space, nice drink selection, local ingredients, weird mix of somewhat pretentious but still comfort food.

I'd recommend the pork buns - even though I think they're totally pretentious, they were good. The cheese curds were ok too. Not greasy and pretty heavy on the batter. I had the fried chicken and waffles - first time having this. Fried chicken was really crispy, of which I'm personally just not a fan.

I'd recommend going for drinks and enjoying the place.

Service: Meh. Our waitress wasn't great but not terrible either. Could just have been a busy night.
Environment: Great space. Nice bar. Lots of outdoor seating. Beautiful view of the Capitol. Is that enough gushing?"}
{"text":"Everything I've had on the menu has been excellent- from burgers to the mac and cheese- and service is super friendly and efficient.  Also great view of the capitol, great beer, great ambience."}
{"text":"Went with a large group so we had to wait for a little while which we expected so no biggie.  The staff were polite and the waitress was quick especially with such a large group.  For apps we ordered the Truffled popcorn, fried cheese curds, cheeese and meat plate and the deviled eggs.  The popcorn was good but really it was just ok not great or amazing and not something I would really order again.  The deviled eggs were good nothing over the top but I would order these again.   The fried cheese curds were pretty good, not sure what to compare these to since it was my first time trying it.  The dish that had everyone raving was the Rainbow Trout and Muscles.  Three different people had this and there wasn't a drop of anything left on their plate. Someone also had the tofu korean bip bop and thought it was unique and a good vegetarian option.  The view is kinda the iceing on the cake with the capital building all lit up at night it's a great."}
{"text":"Graze occupies one of my favorite urban spaces in all of Madison, the old FirstStar bank plaza on the Capitol Square, next door to the (overpriced, overrated) L'Etoille. There are lots of big windows with great views of the Capitol building. I'd been here a couple of times to sample what may be the best selection of Wisconsin brews in town, but had never dined. The menu is small but eclectic, with a variety of oddball dishes (chicken and waffles?). Started with the goat meatballs . . . these were somewhat bland at first (particularly the meat), but the flavor grew on me after a few bites. I went with the Burger of The Week, which had onions carmelized in beer, ham, and coarse-grain mustard with greens. Very delicious, everything tasted fresh (not surprising given that their ingredients are all locally sourced). But the real star here was the french fries . . . they do literally melt in your mouth. They are also served with an aioli sauce, so for once I didn't have to ask for a side of mayo! My recommendation for now would be to get anything that has fries, but I look forward to returning and sample some of their other unique dishes."}
{"text":"This is an OK restaurant.  If you're looking for great that are plenty of other options.  I have tried Graze twice both with the same moderate results.  Both times the entrees were a bit underwhelming.  Both times for brunch.  Minimal wait times for a seat draw me in, the wait times for food turn me off.  I had the breakfast sandwich, it was as good as you'd expect from a quick service restaurant, I expected more.  Small for $10-12.  The second time I ordered the biscuits and gravy.  I didn't expect the best biscuits and gravy.  What I was served was a single biscuit with a few tiny pieces of chicken in a cream sauce (as opposed to a thick gravy).  The sauce was runny and mostly bland.  The fried egg was ok, again bland.  My wife had the burrito the first time.  It tasted great, but was cold in the middle.  That seems weird for a scratch made to order restaurant.  The second time she ordered pancakes they were tiny thin, a bit bland and covered in a heavy coat of powder.  The bacon was dynamite, very good, as is the Kickapoo coffee.  

In the end my problem is the food is ok, too expensive, and I hate to send the food back because that is wasting food.  

I love that Graze uses local fresh ingredients, but it's Madison and that is not unique."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks, and service. I like their bibimbap for dinner, though most of their entrees are good.

Cheese curds- not my favorite, but some friends say they are their favorites. If you like thick breading on cheese curds, give them a go.

For breakfast, they have a good egg sandwhich, and their tofu/ egg scramble specials are usually pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Owned by the same people as Le'Toille, these people obviously know what they are doing. More reasonably priced than its neighbor, the dinner and brunch here are fantastic. Possibly my favorite overall restaurant in Madison. You can't go wrong here. Even the drinks are awesome."}
{"text":"Great place, location is outstanding, employees are super competent, food is excellent.

Recommend the pork buns a million times over!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and makes you feel like you just picked the veggies out of the garden and then they make the meal for you. I have never had a bad experience here and all of the waitstaff are courteous and kind.  I have never had anything i don't like, try away!!"}
{"text":"In love with Graze's happy hour! (4-6) 
Two for one drafts - with some very fine microbrews on tap at already very reasonable prices. Graze knows how to attract the after-work crowd on the Capitol. The setting sun shines beautifully through the expansive glass wall to the west. Relaxed yet responsive, unpretentious but upscale, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"Sadly, I'm giving Graze 2-stars because of the abysmal service we experienced today. We swung by around 1:30 for brunch, and waited at the bar for about 20 minutes. The bartenders need training in hospitality and customer service. It is inexcusable to be treated the way we were treated today. I would welcome giving the restaurant manager specific feedback if you care to respond to this with an email. Once we were seated, at least our table server had a personality and was very nice. However, she was not able to serve us consistently or quickly. I really expected more from the L'Etoile team. Very disappointed. At least the food was good, but aggravation of (1) being completely disregarded by the bartenders then (2) having to wait and ask and wait and ask some more when we got seated deflated the experience."}
{"text":"This is specifically a Mothers Day Brunch review. It's 1:30 on Mothers Day and you are out of beignets and pancakes. Seriously?  Pancakes and beignets. Batter takes like 3-5 minutes to prepare. Hasn't been busier than a normal Farmers Market brunch but the excuse is that the kitchen has been busy and is tired. 

It is this arrogance that causes me to usually not want to eat at a Tory Miller restaurant. Sorry I came here today - although the bar staff is great and the reason for the two stars. We have many better options in town now thankfully. Folks that see the customer as spending their hard earned dollars for a meal out and wanting to provide a great experience.  And many have better food now, frankly, and are even better at farm to table. Should have gone to Heritage or Merchant or Marigolds since I am downtown. Won't make this mistake again. 

PS. I hate giving bad reviews to home town places where I have had good meals in the past, but I feel less bad right now since:
1.  Coffee was like warm. Asked for fresh cup. Barely above Luke warm. 
2. Breakfast sandwich on English muffin. Bottom muffin is wet, and not in a good way. 
Friend asked server for rec on hot sauce to no avail. 
If not for bar staff, one star."}
{"text":"Cheese curds are good-my first time having them. A bit rich of course, but tasty. The Ramen Noodle bowl is the tits. New Glarus Moon Man on tap is also killer. Really good service as well"}
{"text":"So I expect a lot at a farm to table restaurant. And sadly I tried a small plate and an entree and neither impressed me whatsoever. I hate leaving poor reviews when the staff is kind and the ambiance and heart behind it is lovely. 
The food just seemed so lackluster and...missing a lot of flavor."}
{"text":"I've been here for brunch and dinner. Graze is a solid place to take a friend or co-worker, with a very modern atmosphere and great view of the capitol. You can definitely tell this place uses quality, local ingredients.

I had the corned beef hash for brunch and it was decent. I tried the chilaquiles and it was OK.

In my last visit, I had the Bibimbap for dinner. It was very good, and a generous portion. The server notified me that it was very spicy - I like spicy and I thought it was very tolerable. This dish was great, but if I go somewhere for Bibimbap I'm going back to Sujeo for the hot stone bowl. 

Overall this place is worth trying but I haven't had anything that blew me away."}
{"text":"I loved the service and the food.  I had the fried cheese curds, pretzels, and BBQ tofu; all was delicious. It was a little noisy for conversation."}
{"text":"Loved this place during a visit to see friends in Madison.  Very organic and farm to table concept.

I had the Bibimbap, which had a ton of vegetables, pork, and a really nice spicy sauce.  It was a great portion.  My wife had the Beet & Walnut Burger.  She just couldn't get over how awesome it was.  We were in Madison 4 days and only went to Graze once.  Next time, I will go every day!  It was that good."}
{"text":"Great place to go for lunch...  but awful acoustics.   Everything echoes.   Best cup of coffee in town, but smaller than anticipated serving size ( need more than a few pieces pieces of  soggy lettuce to call it a side salad)        But this is where I will always bring my out of town guests for lunch for the million dollar view!     Beautiful location!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time here & were not disappointed! Typically there is a wait to get a table, but got there late enough where we got a table! We had: 
-Drinks:Pilsner & Octoberfest beers! Yum! 

- Starters: you can order full or half sizes which are great options depending on what entree is chosen! ....Soft Pretzel with honey mustard, cheese, & spicy Dijon mustard!  Also, cheese curds with dipping sauce... both super delicious options! 

- Plates: salmon with pebble pasta & veggies, good portion & cooked to perfection! Beet burger pattie with fries! Tasted just as great as the first time! 

Staff is friendly, environment is inviting, could be kid friendly, decently priced, & right in front of the capital!"}
{"text":"What more can I say about this place that hasn't already been said? The food, the atmosphere, Chef Tory Miller- they just can't be beat. The cheese curds trump even the Old Fashioned's, and I salivate at the mere thought of the beet and walnut burger. Don't even get me started on the bibimbap... Needless to say, the food is otherworldly (in such a simple-and-clean-cuisine way), and the drinks aren't bad either. Graze is the epitome of Madison farm-to-table and I swear I love it more each time I go. Hands down my favorite Madison restaurant."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Graze.  I usually try to stay away from downtown Madison as the businesses are starting to feel more pretentious than industrious.  But this place is truly a gem.  The atmosphere was nice, the decor was inviting, the service was spectacular and the food was good too. I was surprised that the pricing was not too bad and there is genuine effort going into creating an interesting menu with local foods.  

Well done.  I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was light, great view of capitol, though loud. This spot was recommended to us and our first disappointing meal on the list for this trip. We loved the rhubarb lemonade, fried pickles were good, but sweet? Husband and I both got the veggie version of the pub burger which was fine, but low flavor and rich. For the first time ever, neither of us finished our fries and he had to finish my burger for me. Fries were fried  long enough that they left burnt flavor in your mouth and there were lots of very dark fries. The service was polite but she seems like she might be in a bad mood. We are unfortunately disappointed based on the recommendation but it wasn't a terrible experience at all."}
{"text":"Nowhere else has cheese curds quite as impressive as graze's. And there's the graze burger.

Both of these dishes are life makers. Yes the graze burger is worth the splurge. Sure other stuff is good to.

But this is what you come for. Curds. Burger."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how we ended up at Graze most evenings this summer, but that's just the way the cookie crumbled. Speaking of cookies, I had their cookies and milk three times last month, then went out and bought a gallon of Sassy Cow milk because milk never tasted so good. Before my first Sassy Cow experience here, I thought milk was supposed to taste like the inside of a refrigerator, that's how city I am. Then I went to the World Dairy Expo and learned a lot about the dairy industry and how in most restaurants (except Graze) you should just order chocolate milk if you're going to order milk at all. 

Graze has consistently good ambiance for dessert and drinks, and it's a nice place with ample seating to take out-of-town guests. On Saturdays you'll have to be willing to wait for a table, but they have a high-tech messaging system, so if you're not scared of the NSA and giving away your mobile phone number to the stranger-hostess, you can wander the square for a second-choice spot in case the wait is long. 

Sometimes they're adventurous with their brunch and cocktail menu, and sometimes those adventures succeed. I would give their seasonal punches a chance or two, and the bibimbap burrito was a win example. But, be careful what you wish for, because they're so fashion by the time you try getting your hands on an item, it's probably been discontinued and already all over Instagram."}
{"text":"The food is fine but the service is less than impressive. I was there for brunch once and I asked he server if I could do bacon on the side instead of greens and they outright said 'no'. Bacon was on the brunch menu so I was a little confused because it wasn't like I was ordering something they didn't already carry. I wish their servers would care more about the customers experience."}
{"text":"Great place with a great local vibe. The Graze Burger is my go to here. Pricey, but a must try. Nothing is needed with this burger... it's as good as it gets!"}
{"text":"bibimbap burrito is a must. holy crap it's delicious. (this was in all caps but yelp prohibited that)"}
{"text":"Been here several times since visiting our son at UW. Always liked the place and the food, but this past trip (8-29-14) we had a 5 star experience. First off, as before, we ordered some deviled eggs as a starter, and they were really tasty. I drank a Kir Royale (with cava and Creme de cassis). WOW!! Refreshing!! My wife, son and I then shared a bowl of mussels (a bit spicy for my taste) and a fresh salad, and then dove into some fabulous oysters. We all finished off with some artisan cheeses and meats that were out of this world. Also had some keg wine which was really good.

The bartender and server were very knowledgeable and totally there for us. The vibe here is really Wisconsin friendly. The view of the capital across the street is special.

Thanks Graze!!"}
{"text":"This is s great place and I love the menu. They had an off night in terms of service and some execution on the meals.

Dinner took over an hour and 30....kind of long when we had 2 salads, fried chicken and mussels. It took nearly 45 minutes to get our main course.

My order was lukewarm by the time I got it and the bread to go with the mussels was burnt black...kind of inedible. But we waited so long it wasn't worth sending it back to heat up but I did ask for fresh crustinis.

Dessert- we ordered the blueberry pie which we though would be quick...wrong...took nearly 20 minutes to get when they said 5 minutes.

Tough night they did comp dessert but really bad execution. I was worn out after dinner because it took so long."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The food is great, comes from local farms, and is healthier than what you'll find at many of the pubs on the Square. I also find that the portion sizes at Graze are just perfect - I don't find myself feeling stuffed when I'm done!"}
{"text":"My barstool was wobbly.  Bartender forgot our cheese curds (no charge though). My bibimbap was so yummy but wasn't as good as it usually is. I mean...it was good but not $16 good. $11-13 good. What happened to $14 bibimbap?! Astonishing lapses in an otherwise grrrrrr8 place."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I could give Graze 5 stars on atmosphere alone. When you walk in you are immediately impressed by the high ceiling and the huge windows. The natural lighting and modern decor make simply being here an experience. There is a beautiful view of the capitol out of a wall that's just a giant piece of glass, and looking around the restaurant I seemed to be surrounded by politicians and bankers having their fancy business lunches.

My waitress was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. Her ability to speak at such great length about Graze's food demonstrates that they take pride in their quality, and it exhibits a professionalism reminiscent of a gourmet restaurant.

However, the food wasn't particularly amazing, with a few notable exceptions. The falafel po-boy that I ordered was amateurish; while the bread and vegetables were excellent, the actual Arab parts of it were completely disappointing. The falafel and hummus here reminded me of the canned stuff that I get from the Arabic grocery store. The fries were just alright; I loved that they served them with mayonnaise rather than ketchup though.

The soup du jour (butternut squash) was far too savory for me. If you're going to make a soup that thick and creamy, you can't make it that sweet. It seems like the skill was there to make excellent soup, but unfortunately, the execution wasn't. 

They have a great grilled cheese sandwich, albeit that it was simple and imitable. Graze's dedication to high-quality ingredients is what allowed it to stand out. Their choice of mustard for it gave it a very interesting taste, and the cheese was incredibly fresh.

Speaking of cheese, I absolutely love the cheese curds. They were completely unlike any other curds I've had, but there's nothing wrong with that. They were much larger than usual, and whereas your average cheese curd is 50% batter, this one was light and fluffy, with a very thin and sweet breading. These monstrous cheese curds were little meals and cost only $7. One basket was enough for four people.

The Graze has so much going for it, so it's tough to stomach that I'm not exactly getting the best food I've ever had here. If they showed just a little more consistency and cooking ability, they could be one of the best restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Went here with my mind already made up that I was going for the Graze burger.  I ordered it cooked medium.  Even though the burger didn't come out medium (it came out medium well) it was still a fantastic burger.  It says on the menu that the burger is a composition of ground bacon, sirloin, ribeye & short ribs.  I didn't taste any bacon at all but I go back to flavor.  The flavor was phenomenal.  Also, one tiny detail I wished they could look into is getting a little finer grind on the hamburger meat.  It was chunky and that was probably the reason for it being a touch overcooked.  I don't mind paying $21 for a phenomenal burger if it's worth it and this one was.   The small stuff I am pointing out is just minor details.  The good of the burger is how well it meshes with the rest of the components, the caramelized onions, cabernet jus, and compound butter were in perfect harmony with the meat and that is what makes this burger 5 stars. This burger does not need anything else on it to shine because it shines bright like a diamond.  Service was decent, nothing spectacular but good enough."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and courteous. Food was well prepared with great flavor. Large dining areas can accommodate small or larger groups. Very pleased with my experience but not blown away. Food was very good but not amazing. Local sourced ingredients were a nice touch but makes the menu a bit eclectic."}
{"text":"The best chocolate chip cookies, hot out of the oven, takes 20 min to make - cannot be beat. 
Drinks - A big plus, great bartender, standard fare well done. 
Food - I would give the food '3 stars'. I think it is good and I will go back but not something I miss sooo much that I need to go there. That might also be because I went there way too many times last year. 
It looks all fancy and all from outside, but prices are decent and the wait is no more than 30 mins most days; and if you go later you can sit down easily, especially in small groups. 
Will I go there again and again - Yes :)"}
{"text":"Ambiance: 5. Graze checks all the boxes. Outstanding view of capitol building, a modern feel which the restaurant \"owns\" by using floor to ceiling glass, relatively small tables, and a very crisp/clean look with everything else. As others mentioned a tad loud but that's to be expected given high ceilings, and actually not all that bad considering this fact.

Cost: 3. Agnostic here, I'm assuming for Madison this place is a bit on the pricey side but well worth it given other categories.

Food Quality: 5. Very unique farm-to-table menu with a wide range of food options for those with unique circumstances (Gluten-free, etc.) and a large step up from what was described as \"American\" cuisine.  All ordered dishes were outstanding and despite being from what I would consider different cuisines: sauteed vegetables, bibimbap, oysters, etc. Looking around I'd also feel very safe ordering anything from seasonal menu.

Service: 5. In typical midwestern fashion, folks were extremely friendly and helpful.

When to return: Visit with foodies. Special occasion/celebration. Posting up at a fancy bar for happy hour. Date night. Restaurant with a view. The list goes on."}
{"text":"Love the vibe and space! A little pricey, but the food is pretty good. The burgers are big and delicious. The mac and cheese, cheese curds and nachos are amazing! The service was a little lackluster, but sadly I almost expect that at most places like this."}
{"text":"Came here with some family for drinks and dessert. I like how they use local ingredients for all their food. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu. 

I had the coffee stout beer and a grasshopper sundae. Both were very tasty! My wife had the Apple crisp. It had good flavor but the \"crisp\" was more like a crunch (very hard). 

Beautiful view of the Capitol from the dinning room but the large room made for a very loud environment because of the resonance. 

Overall, I had a good visit. Make a visit to this place for good service and fresh food made with local ingredients!"}
{"text":"I ordered:

-deviled egg: tasty. 

-pork buns: delightful though kind of small. 

-Bibimbap: mediocre/disappointing. Great presentation but the vegetables are under seasoned, there isn't enough gochujang, and the meat is dry."}
{"text":"Well, Nobody Got Sick..........
Our party of 8 determined to make a birthday brunch memorable met at the Graze.  Yes it's clean and the food was warm, that's about as generous as I'll get.  It took in excess of 15 minutes to get the server's attention to start the drink order.  The brunch beverages left so much to be desired I don't know where to begin.  Watered down overpriced Creamsicles and Bloody Mary's despite a specific \"hold the ice\" order.  Then there was the chocolate milk.  My granddaughter has NEVER refused to drink chocolate milk until she drank *what* was served.  She took a sip and said, \"this tastes gross\".  It tasted like cold powdered hot chocolate with a very stale after-taste. I checked it for her and concurred.  My granddaughter told the server same and she just walked away.  After multiple attempts to get the server's attention, I asked for another glass because it tasted foul.  She came back and stated, \"We checked the jug and it was fine to us.\".  WHAAAT?  My granddaughter also ordered the kids mac & cheese.  Generally speaking, M&C is the universal favorite of children with an almost guaranteed high consumption rate.  Not here, and she's not a picky eater.   Then, another party member asked for more syrup for his dry pancake stack.  Whereupon I was informed that it would be \"an additional $.50 charge for more syrup\".  Again, I questioned why in a restaurant that considers itself upscale, would lower itself to an additional charge for what amounted to be a shot glass sized pitcher.  I had them put my Egg(sic) Benedict in a dog box so I could give it to the homeless guy waiting outside that had already been shooed away once.  First of all, I don't necessarily disagree with a surcharge for larger parties, however, you still have to EARN and WORK to receive it.  The server shamelessly gave herself a generous $40 tip, of which, I'd say $18 was earned based upon food and beverage quality, cleanliness and ability to produce a bill in record time.  Sorry, this is a \"never again\" for me."}
{"text":"Atmosphere:  Fun tall ceilings and I am a big fan of the all glass window wall facing the capital square.  
Service: Very good.  Sometimes a wait in weekends.  Never had a problem with finding bar seats
Food:  Very good lunch and dinner.  Best thing had there was the Graze Burger.  It is pricey, so we shared it. It was melt in your mouth delicious.    We had the cookies and milk for dessert.  -So Good!"}
{"text":"Went here last weekend while in Madision for dinner.  The food was terrific and the waitress was too.  Love me some bone marrow with a nice IPA."}

We just moved to Madison recently and have been checking out lots of restaurants. Graze was one of the best and most fun experiences we have had so far. We arrived @6:30 on a Tuesday night. They were busy but were able to get us right in.

Things were looking up right away as we perused the cocktail menu. We love unique cocktails. For example, they had one called: Sweater Weather which includes cardamom cognac, maple syrup, orange and lemon and is served warm. Funny and interesting, this is very promising. 

Our server Jessie arrived. Jessie was so much fun. She was prompt, knowledgeable about the menu, she didn't rush us, friendly and engaging. She seemed like someone we'd want to hang out with. Our service was spectacular! I hope we are in her section the next time we visit.

We started with cocktails called Chefs Don't Fly and Rosie Dear. Ingredients included hibiscus liquor and rosemary syrup. We followed those with Ginger Snap and Calliope. The first three were all delicious! (The Calliope was basically champagne.) These are not drinks you get just anywhere. 

For food we decided to share small plates. We started with the fried cheese curds. Greasy fried gooey cheese. You really can't go wrong. Next came the pork buns. These were a sweet bun filled with pork, fresh cilantro, and pickled vegetables. This was probably my least favorite dish, (I wasn't a huge fan of one of the pickled vegetables), and yet the pork, cilantro, and bun were delicious. I would eat it again. Next we ordered the full charcuterie board. Let me start by saying everything on it was absolutely mouth-watering. However, it was surprisingly sparse in the contents for the price. There were 4 slices of buttered, toasted bread (very good). A small dish of pickles and mustard. A small dish of pork rillette. (Yum!), A slice of pate (One of the best things we ate) about the size of a 1/2 deck of cards and 3 slices of soppressata and 3 slices of coppa. This is the part that was surprising. Imagine a quarter. Now slice that quarter into 3 wafer thin slices. That was the soppresata. Imagine 2 quarters next to each other. Slice that into 3 thin slices. That was the coppa. They looked small and lonely and very sparse on that charcuterie board. However, they were delicious and melted in your mouth. Next we ordered a dozen oysters. There were 4 each of 3 different varieties. Again perfection. The only thing better would have been to pluck them directly from the ocean. Actually this was better because we didn't have to shuck them. Our final small plate was the soft pretzel. This came with the most incredible spreadable cheese as well as 3 varieties of mustard. Again, I was extremely pleased.

So, now it's time for dessert. I notice they have flights of dessert drinks on the menu. I'm always a fan of flights because I like to try a little of everything. The flight included small pours of 5 dessert wines. Wow! I had three ports, a sherry,and an amaro. The amaro was bitter and not to my taste, but the others were sweet and delicious. This was a great deal and more than made up for any disappointment I had about the charcuterie. For dessert we also tried the hickory-nut bourbon carmel pie and I believe a cranberry coffee-cake. I highly recommend the pie. Even if I hadn't loved everything else, I would go to Graze just to get this pie. It was amazingly good.

This was truly an outstanding experience. The food, beverages and the service were spot-on. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We stopped in to get a late lunch. It was my birthday. But they only have sandwiches and salads to offer. We asked for dinner entrees, they said it wouldn't be ready till dinner time.
So I had a wrap for my meal, it was not healthy ( with yellow creamy mayo and deep fried bacon!) Waiter tried to sell us Blue berry Lemonade, it's very sugary, and color, full of ice cube...for $3.50! Great location tho right next to the Capitol building.

Disappointing!"}
{"text":"Was visiting from Chicago and thought we check out something up to our standards with our preference to try something local. 

Love the concept of farm to table and the map that greeted us with the pinpoints of all the farms they source from.

We ordered a variety of dishes since we had 5 people in tow. Here are my strong points:

- House lemonade was delish! That day was a rhubarb strawberry lemonade.
- Daily cheese and meat is not be to be missed. Love the variety and presentation.
- My daughter's Grilled Cheese was the best dish at our table!
- Berry shortcake with ice cream = winner!

Weak points:
- Salads were blah, though the dressings were unique.
- Wasn't thrill with the appetizers. We ordered fried pickles, popcorn and deviled eggs. Wish I ordered the bread basket.
- Menu concept. I don't know if they are trying to be innovative and it's obvious or they are trying to showcase a variety of offerings. Wish it was more home grown and basic - it's anywhere from farm dishes to diner to korean."}
{"text":"Arrrggh, it pains me so much to drop Graze to 4 stars instead of 5, but after having had their regular menu (winter seasonal), I just can't justify the 5.

Having had their delicious, delicious menu during Restaurant week, I recently went back to try their regular menu.

Among 6 people, we split the Wisconsin Artisan cheese board, curry roasted vegetables, cheese curds and each got an individual entree.

I went with the Graze Burger because well... I'm at Graze.

Let me start off with their cheese board. Now I'm not a big fan of cheese in the first place, so it wouldn't be fair for me to judge this place entirely based off of that. However, I expected a bit more than 4 chunks of cheese laid out next to pieces of walnut date bread. Granted, I didn't try much of the bread or the cheese, so you can just ignore this part of my review.

Moving on. Their curry roasted vegetables weren't bad, but I think it would have tasted better with curry cream instead of aioli.

Their cheese curds were good, I'm not gonna lie, but they weren't as melted on the inside as I would have liked. Maybe it's just because the cheese curds have been so hyped up for me, that I expected nothing but perfection.

Finally, I'll admit that the burger was one of the best I've ever had. The mixture of different beef types really tenderized the burger, giving it a super soft and juicy inside. The cabernet jus added just enough sweetness to the burger without overpowering it. The brioche was definitely a good choice for the burger, due to the soft and puffy texture. Because the burger was so juicy, the soft brioche did a really good job soaking up the flavor, adding another dimension to the dish. 

My only issue with the burger was that, while delicious, I don't think it warranted the $21 price tag. I've definitely had comparable burgers before for less, though the difference probably wasn't too big.

On pure potential alone (see my restaurant week experience), this place deserves a 5; but because that menu will only be served on special occasions, I can only give this place a 4."}
{"text":"Not worth the hype. Food was strange and unsatisfactory for the price. Seating arrangement was awkward- I hate being sat on a long table with other people right next to me, especially when they are having an awkward conversation."}
{"text":"I must say, the manager or owner actually contacted me and was displeased I was not happy. So for customer satisfaction they are on top of their game and will go back to try them again. That's the kind of service I expect from quality restaurants!"}
{"text":"From out of town for EPIC and looking for some foodie options. This place was a major let down. I sat at the bar, being by myself and the hipster bartenders couldn't be any less friendly. I got an overly pretentious cocktail made from a NY distillery of botanical herbs and it tasted like a sweet tart shot you would get at a college bar. I got the beet salad and the (truffle) popcorn. I don't know what they put in their lettuce mix but I swear I was eating weeds from the sidewalk cracks and the popcorn was pretty tasteless and the kernels so small that it was hard to eat and made a mess. The atmosphere was pleasing and their is outdoor seating which is nice."}
{"text":"We had a gift card from Graze but was not able to get downtown for some reason or the other. With the start of summer, we were able to make it for brunch one Saturday morning. The food was okay but not as good as it was hyped to be. It was busy so had a long wait. The waitress was courteous and we got our food quickly after we got a table. Will plan to visit one more time to try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"It's been nearly a decade since I'd been back to Madison and I was surprised to see how many new and interesting restaurants have popped up in that time! After strolling up State and around the Capitol, we stopped at Graze for a bite, under the recommendation of a friend of ours.

First, the view is fantastic! I love the simple, modern atmosphere. Our server was really pleasant and knowledgeable about the beer list as well as the menu. We ordered drinks and 2 appetizers, the cheese curds and the deviled eggs. Unfortunately, we were so full after the apps, that we couldn't even bear to order dinner. Seriously disappointing.

BUT, we ended up going back for brunch two days later and we were not disappointed. I had the loaded egg sandwich, which was criminally delicious. The bread was very, very tasty. There was a perfect ratio of cheese to egg to bacon. It was also accompanied by a very nice mixed greens, simply dressed salad, so I didn't feel SO much like I was clogging every last artery. I also had a bloody mary, which was probably the best one I'd had in Madison. 

I am definitely planning a return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"For the price, was not impressed. The steak was overdone and tasteless. The chicken and waffles were a huge disappointment. However, service is spectacular."}
{"text":"Very good food, a bit pricey. Nice beer, wine and cocktails selection. Our group of four dined tapas style, sharing a cheese board of chef's selections (all tasty) and a paté (soooo good, despite looking gross), the tofu bibimbap (very spicy and uniquely delicious), and a couple salads (gourmet). I would recommend each of these and will definitely go back next time we're in Madison."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Madison restaurants.  Excellent local Wisconsin food with a new twist, fair prices, good service."}
{"text":"I visited my sister in Madison a week after Thanksgiving and we decided on Graze's for lunch. The ambiance was extremely nice. We sat at the bar and the view of the capital was amazing. I recently stopped eating meat and went with the Sweet Potato Falafel Salad and I am still thinking about it today...lol! IT WAS SOOOOO AWESOME!!!!! 

The fried pickles weren't that good (unfortunately). The batter was sort of sweet, so that threw my palate off a little. The bartender was great with removing it from my bill. Overall, if you are in the downtown Madison, WI area, I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"outstanding....excellent food, cocktails, service, prices, and location.  everything our party ordered was delicious: pickle plate, popcorn, fried cheese, bim bim bop, lamb sausage, chicken and waffles, bone marrow, and even the uber expensive graze burger was yummy. so well seasoned and juicy.  yum.  they even have a drink that tastes like an orange creamsicle...heave."}
{"text":"My family took me here for Mother's Day brunch. I had heard about Graze so I was impressed and excited about their selection. When I ordered iced coffee, the server suggested Magic Coffee. Decadent and delicious. Creamy but not too thick, sweet but not too sticky. But I was so disappointed with my entree. My Eggs Benedict could have been so good if they had only toasted the English muffin! The eggs were beautifully poached. The consistency of the hollandaise was like a nice glaze rather than a thick dollop. But without the crunchy texture of an English muffin, it all turned to mush. Perhaps they chose to give it a quick turn on the grill but that only warmed it up. Huge mistake!"}
{"text":"Service was slow considering it was lunch.  Salads were very small for the price and not tasty.
They did not meet our expectations.  We will not return to this restaurant.  There are many better restaurants to choose from on the square. Waitress was kind."}
{"text":"happy to upgrade my rating!  

we stopped by for some drinks and apps.  i was very happy with the cheese curds and we had a seasonal heirloom tomato with stuffed squash blossom appetizer.. the latter was just fabulous.  so fresh and the seasoning was perfect.  i wish i could eat it again and again.


aaaannndd... again i had another lovely meal.  yummy tofu scramble, though the bloody mary was a bit too far on the horseradishy side.   the cheesecurds didn't fail to disappoint, once again.."}
{"text":"I met some friends here and I love the concept behind this place. We had a larger party so there was a bit of a wait for a table. The server was fairly attentive but he was very infrequent in how often he came to our table. I don't know if this is typical of brunch place but the server didn't even come take our drink order for at least 10 minutes. It took another 10 minutes to get my drink (which was a coke). Then we waited for another 15 minutes for the server to come back to take our orders. The food took forever to come and it was slightly disappointing. My boyfriend got the biscuit and gravy (which he eats everywhere) and he said it was the worst meal at a resturant he has ever had. The french fries were really good and the seasonal fruit was top notch. Make sure you have a lot of time on your hands before going."}
{"text":"I came here because another restaurant's server and I discussed Corned Beef Hash and where to go.  My husband is serious about his hash so I had to take him here.  We were seated immediately and had an excellent view of everything.  I decided to order up some beignets for a starter along with some grapefruit juice.  The juice was spot on.  Not too tart and not too sweet.  The beignets reminded me of how much I missed Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans.  Very tasty but not an exact to the southern restaurant.  Our brunch choices were chicken & waffle (never had so I  thought to try it) and the corned beef hash.  The corned beef hash was served with two eggs over easy and we chose wheat toast.  Thee toast was too tough but the corned beef hash tasted great so we just ignored the bread.  The hash had awesome amounts of corned beef and the vegetables that were added really peaked the flavor.  The way they cooked it on the grill top gave a little bit of a sear which allowed the beef to be a little nutty flavored.  Though the eggs we got were a tad overcooked, we still had a little yolk to enjoy with the hash.  

The chicken was beautifully fried and very moist inside.  The waffle had a great cinnamon butter and it really allowed the fluffy goodness come through.  Personally, I don't understand the WOW factor of having chicken with waffles...though both tasted great I feel that I don't need to have both together again.  
All in all, I'll be back and I can't wait to try the cocktails and lunch or dinner menu."}
{"text":"I was very excited to have lunch at Graze. The ambiance is very upbeat, casual, yet upscale. For an appetizer I shared cheese curds with my friend. they were extremely good and represented Wisconsin pretty well. The dill sauce dip was flavorful and had a good bite to it. As an entree I had the Graze Burger, and although the meat was juicy and tender, the burger itself was a little boring. It really was a burger topped with some caramelized onions. Nothing too special.  I also tried the cream soda. I sort of had the perception that it would be the retro rad cream soda that I remember drinking when I was a kid, but instead it seemed like soda mixed in with vanilla ice cream. Super sweet and not good to wash down your food. It was more like a dessert. I will go to Graze again, but I will probably order something else along the lines of a pork schnitzel or some sort of fish."}
{"text":"I have eaten brunch and lunch at Graze a few times and found the food to be pretty ordinary, nothing very special.  Last evening, I ate dinner there during restaurant week with my husband and friend and we had a first rate meal for the price of $25.  Between the three of us, we sampled all but two dishes on the menu of options: 3 choices each on the appetizer, entree and dessert lists.  Everything selected was very tasty, well-presented and had great flavor.  Standouts included the BBQ rib and cod cake appetizers and all three entrees.  The apple crisp dessert could have been improved with less sugar but it was still very good.  Service was efficient and un-obtrusive."}
{"text":"Graze is in prime location and it's popular, which means sometimes the service and food can take a while. I find the location, price range, and quality of food makes it perfect for dates and meetings but I wouldn't go there casually or to celebrate a big day. 

The food ranges from \"fine\" to \"great.\" Sometimes the fanciness pays off, sometimes it doesn't. With their burgers in particular I think simpler is better. Try the cheese curds for sure."}
{"text":"i generally don't like to review any restaurant if i haven't been there at least 2 or 3 times, but there's always an exception to be made since i will be leaving the country soon. when you first walk into the place, the open, urban design is very inviting and (if you're hungover like i was) the natural lighting will wake you up in no time. after hearing countless praise from my sis and bro-in-law, who are long-time madison residents and big foodies as well, i was gonna be in for a treat, right? beautiful decor & ambiance, great service, variety of choices for brunch, but sadly a very disappointing ramen noodle bowl me. the noodles were too clumpy, thin, and soggy, radish slices were more for presentation than anything, and the broth had little depth, just a lot of soy and fish sauce. they say you're supposed to eat with your eyes, in this case i wish i had and left the tasting to my company. btw, my sister and her husband thoroughly enjoyed their dishes, as they didn't speak a word once their plates came out. ^^

me: ramen noodle bowl (braised pork shoulder, pork belly, bok choy, shaved radishes, scallions, nori, soft poached egg, Wah Kee noodles)

my sis: egg scramble (seasonal preparation, served with mixed greens and potatoes)

my bro-in-law: fancy pants pancakes w fresh blueberries

food: 3 out of 4 stars
ambiance: 5 out of 5 stars
value: 4 out of 5 stars
service: 5 out of 5 stars"}
{"text":"Headed in for an early dinner with our 7-month-old in tow.  They were offering a limited menu at that time, which was more than fine with us.  After a too long dinner the night before it allowed us to give Graze a whirl without subjecting our daughter to another two hour dinner.  

Service was nice, without being overly the top friendly - more of the down-to-earth level of friendly, which was nice and how I prefer service to be.  They very kindly parked our stroller for us and presented us with a very clean high chair - which, let me tell you, is a bit of a rarity.  I didn't have to wipe this one down before we placed our daughter in.  

We had a carb filled food fest here.  We started with the pretzel - delicious!  Loved the mustards (especially the tarragon and horseradish)  and the brick cheese spread was lovely.  We also went with a cheese plate and I was pleased with them all.  The walnut bread was quite nice and the compote was tasty.  We both went with the Pub Burger and were very impressed.  I love a burger with a little garden of loveliness on top, however, most places I have to pick off a not-yet-ripe tomato, or not-so-crisp onions or soggy lettuce.  I'm a bit of a pain in the ass when it comes to topping my burger - the ingredients must be perfect.  Theirs were complete and total perfection.  The only minor issue was my English muffin was a bit too soggy, but otherwise, it was delicious.  It was cooked perfectly medium rare and was the perfect size 1/4lb patty.  Delicious, not obnoxious and huge.  The portion of fries with a side of garlic aioli was enormous and tasty.  

Truly, a great meal was had here!  I was nervous about bringing our daughter - but was touched by the fact that her presence was no big deal at all.  So, if you have kids and they're well behaved or you're good about being on top of their happiness while dining and are mindful of fellow diners - go ahead and bring them here.   We look forward to dining at Graze again!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for a quick brunch after working out at the gym. I was looking for something healthy+vegetarian, and settled on the fresh squeezed orange juice and the beet salad.

While I was waiting, I enjoyed the ambiance--tall ceilings with floor-to-ceiling windows, and large chalkboards featuring local farmers, cheeses, and other local artisan people. I saw that they were supporting the Bleu Mont cheese people this month, and I had just tried some of their delicious cheese curds at the farmer's market.

The beet salad was really good! I think everything was from the farmer's market. Fresh feta, wild greens, lots of beets, thin slices of pear, and some creamy sauce on the side--all plated well. I felt that the feta and creamy sauce were competing flavors, and at the end of the day, I liked the creamy sauce better. I enjoyed my fresh beets and felt that some more greens would have balanced it out more... but overall, I enjoyed it, and enjoyed supporting the local farmers.

I hear that the burgers here are really good!"}
{"text":"Two words: CHEESE CURDS. My goodness, Graze has some of the best cheese curds I've had. Be sure to come early enough to not miss out-- I stopped by at 9 pm for a late dinner to learn that they were all out  Their menu is constructed around locally sourced foods, which is awesome. Thus, be prepared for a different entrees at each visit! The pork chops were absolutely delicious and so were the sea mussels from our last visit. A cozy atmosphere with great service! I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Graze has gone downhill. They recently changed their brunch menu, and not for the better. Their new loaded breakfast sandwich pales in comparison to the old one. Cheaper ingredients and smaller portions.
Service wasn't good either. I didn't get my drink until after we finished eating. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Went for anniversary dinner, and was not that impressed. My gnocchi had a very strong fennel flavor, which isn't a favorite. I should have read the description more closely I guess. The pork belly sliders were my favorite part of the meal, followed by the curds. The cask Red wine was also good. BF wasn't wild about his $21 burger, I thought the Swiss cheese flavor was too strong. Loved the aioli that came with the fries though."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review for people who, like me, had a terrible meal at Graze and walk out thinking it's somehow your own fault. It's not your fault! Sometimes the food is just awful. 

Last night my wife and I split the Graze Burger, praised by the Food Network and the Wisconsin State Journal as the best burger in Wisconsin, and it was overdone, dry, salty, and coated with a sickly syrup. I am sure that this was just an off night--perhaps a new sous, or a momentary downturn in the quality of their meat--but Graze fed me the worst burger I've had in Madison. I couldn't finish it, and I always finish my burgers!

Their fries were good, if a bit salty, and the fried curds were not bad, though they were a bit softer than I tend to like. Their wedge salad was the best part of the meal, and it's something I would happily order again on its own.

The whiskey sour I ordered was almost as bad as the burger: medicinal, alkaline, with the bitter notes of cheap whiskey and the sugary notes of a poorly-balanced sour mix.

Graze food isn't always like this. Their breakfast pastries rival those of Madison Sourdough for being the best in town, and I've had a braised goat sandwich off their lunch menu that was among the best meals I've had in my fourteen years in this city. But going to Graze is always a roll of the dice: if you want a good meal you should stick to the beer list, order a cheese or charcuterie platter, and ask your server for advice about what food to order."}
{"text":"Graze is great for a happy hour with their BOGO wine & mixed drinks. Amazing offering of appetizers, especially the fried cheese curds. I will dream of these cheese curds.

We sat outside and had a great server with an awesome atmosphere and view of the Capitol building. There was construction going on everywhere on the street, but I can imagine how awesome it is when all of that is gone."}
{"text":"***CASUAL RESTAURANT WITH UNIQUE, ORGANIC AND LOCAL OPTIONS***

I recently came here for brunch on a Saturday morning for a client meeting.  Even with the Farmer's Market going on the Square, the wait was only about ten minutes at 11:00 a.m.

This restaurant is relatively new, and was opened by the owners of nearby L'Etoile.  You will notice the French influence on the menu. 

The hostess will take down your number and give you a call when your table is ready.  We tried beignets and fresh fruit.  I also ordered the Bagel and Lox dish.  The everything bagel was toasted perfectly, and the cream cheese was on the side, so I can decide how much to use.  The dish came with a properly sized serving of delicious smoked salmon and fresh dill.  A definite must-try! 

The OJ is truly fresh.  You will know it when you try it.  I would highly recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. As a restaurant professional this is not easy for me to say about a lot of restaurants. The service was excellent, food was great. The prices were astonishing!! The view of the capital at sunset was amazing sitting on the patio on a warm summer night. Almost too perfect to be true but it was true. I have recommended this restaurant to many people that have asked about a restaurant to go to in Madison. It definitely was farm to table!! For two with all of the food we consumed and drinks we spent about $100.00. In Chicago our dinner would have been over $175.00 if not more!"}
{"text":"Dear Graze, 

I am SO mad at you! We have encountered one another twice so far--and you never meet up to the hype. 

No one would write a letter to another person like that, so continuing... I haven't heard a bad thing about Graze from any of the locals. It's beautiful, everyone seems to love it. The first time I went, I had the bibimbap bowl. It tasted like kimchi and that's about it, so if you like kimchi then go for it! I don't crave fermented cabbage on the daily, so it would have been more appetizing to me if there were more flavor profiles. Aside from this, the rest of our experience was pretty \"meh.\" Nothing to write home about. Service, cheese board... Meh.

The second time I went, the food was better, but the service was out the window. We sat for upwards of 25 minutes before being greeted by our server, who I had been watching the whole time to see if she would notice our empty table. (Yeah, I'll creep like that when I've been waiting for 5 minutes already.) I had to go back to the host table to get the ball rolling, and then we waited for another 7 minutes before she came over. Not sorry--this is inexcusable. 

If you go for brunch, order the bibimbap burrito and some cheese curds, but have fun waiting an hour. I am just not going to deal with it again..."}
{"text":"Great food. Perfect location. Attentive staff. Decent price for top notch experience."}
{"text":"I go to this place because of the atmosphere - not the food.  The windows and view of the capitol are wonderful and I love the setting.  But the food is meh.  Most recently I ordered the pub burger with the veggie patty instead of the meat.  It was a patty with wild rice, Bulgar, etc but I don't think there was a single veggie.  The \"veggie\" burger itself had no taste - it just relied on the pickles, sauce, etc.  I expected more from a place like Graze.  I've been there a few other times and each time I have been \"undewhelmed.\"  It looks fancy but I'm not impressed.

One other note - I ordered a root beer with my meal.  Looked at the label and discovered it had high fructose corn syrup.  Really?  For a place touting the local-ness of the food, I would expected them to pick a root beer with more natural ingredients.  Very disappointed in that."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday afternoon with a group of 6. Only 1/2 of our group liked their food. They only serve their brunch menu on Saturdays and it's very limited. Best menu item is cheese curds. No one really liked their bi bim bap burrito (pork or tofu). Hamburger was not good. Breakfast sandwich was good. Fries were okay. Homemade strawberries lemonade was tasty. Location is right across from Farmers Market and Capital building so I see why people like it. It wasn't crowded while we were there, but it took FORever to get our food! Staff was polite tho. We will give it another try with the standard menu and review again."}
{"text":"Hard to admit it, but the 21dollar Graze burger is actually worth it. Ah-maz-ing. I also love the pork buns, and the pickle plate. Other recommendations include the pub burger, bibimbap, mac and cheese, and the cocktails. We have had some great catch of the day specials there as well, though the prices seem a bit inflated lately. Great ambiance and service. Graze's dessert is always good too!"}
{"text":"$10 for a dinky pub burger with a side of fries, good & tasty, but it didn't register too high on my OMG -this-burger-rocks-radar. Decor was cool, service was pretty good-altho somewhat slow. My group seemed to enjoy their meals."}
{"text":"I went here for a late lunch. It was fantastic. I had the Korean BBQ which was the perfect blend of flavor and spice. I also had the cheese curds which were huge and packed with delicious cheese. The only thing I did not enjoy was the special lemonade they had. It was unique but not for me. I highly reccomend trying Graze if you are in the Madison area."}
{"text":"Beautiful architectural design with vast window walls that display the Capitol. It's great to sit by the window especially when the Saturday farmers market is going on - fun people watching. The food is all organic and locally sourced which I like to support when it comes to dining out. Delicious dishes - personal favorite is the bibimbap burrito....and the cheese curds. The cheese curds here are the best on the planet (better than old fashioned in my opinion!)"}
{"text":"Excellent meal.  Must try the burger and cheese curds.  This place also has a great beer selection if you are looking to try local beer!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by several colleagues that have visited Madison and I am glad I checked it out. There is a very fancy french restaurant to the left of Graze (Etoile) but this one is a little more casual. 

We had the mac and cheese with pulled pork and the \"The Graze Burger\" which had \"fresh ground bacon, sirloin, ribeye & short ribs, caramelized onions, cabernet jus, sesame seed-SarVecchio brioche, fries.\" I didn;t really think for a $21 burger that it was that amazing. I also would have preferred a stronger cheese because you really couldn't taste the servicchio cheese that was baked into it. 

Something that did kind of bother me is that we asked for the onions on the side for my friend but it came with the onions on the burger. When I mentioned this to the server he said \"Well does he have a food allergy or just not like onions?\" In my opinion it shouldn't matter what the issue was, we asked for onions on the side and it should have been taken back and corrected. My friend was cool about it and said he would just scrape them off. The server was otherwise pretty helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place!! They're a farm to table type of restaurant, sourcing their food from local places. The have the BEST cheese curds in the state of Wisconsin hands down. I've lived here my whole life and they are by far the best. Their Mac and cheese is phenomenal as well. I also enjoy the pickle board and salads. The staff is always friendly, so that's bonus as well!"}
{"text":"Good: Lovely space.  Good: excellent coffee. Good: Nice wine. Good: gluten free bread option - but you have to ask for it as it is not listed on the menu. Bad: Overly-pretentious waitstaff (la-di-DA - it IS on The Square, after all).  Bad: The worst Reuben I have ever had for which I paid far too much. Bad: too much fried stuff on the menu. Guess you'll have to go and decide for yourself. Just don't order the Reuben."}
{"text":"I have been to Graze five or six times and it's never been great.  The fancy burger is always a mistake, it tastes good for the first few bites but by halfway through it's just gross.  That's my experience of much of the food, in order to make it 'comfort' they kicked up the grease to the point that it's distasteful.  Now when I go with friends I don't know what to order because everything I have tried before was a dud.

Not a terrible place, but there are better in the same area and price range."}
{"text":"This was a First favorite for me in Madison. A great farm to table place. Great ambiance and a better view of one of the most beautiful state capitals in the country. I'd stake my reputation that they have the best cheese curds in the state. 

Menu changes frequently based on season. I've had not so great meals here, but even my worst there is better than most others best meals."}
{"text":"Love the pretzel and beet salad! Beautiful space with a lot of natural light. While I appreciated the great service and locally sourced menu, it felt little overpriced."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar and initially the guy (Jay) who was waiting on us acted like a total jerk. Didn't make eye contact, acted like it was an imposition to wait on us in general, I was surprised bc it seemed like he was so extrovert and nice to the guys at the bar but rude to us (two girls) for some reason. I own a bar and grill and I'm constantly gracious towards waitstaff. We ordered oysters and he turned and walked away without saying anything. We had to ask someone else what options even were- he didn't ask what we preferred or talk to us about the options- when he brought our food out he didn't make eye contact and just set it down, when I said thank you to him he just pursed his lips like WHATEVER and didn't even look at us. Carrie, the other bartender (who I had grabbed her attention a few times even though she didn't start our ticket) was Infinitely nicer. She checked on us constantly, filled our waters, asked how everything was, just in general a way better server. 

The food was mediocre dry duck and sausage- super bland rigatoni-and overpriced for being so mediocre. The absolute best part of dinner was desert and Carries stellar service. Had it not been those things, this would have been a one or two star."}
{"text":"One of the only places in town that I like.  Great design, food and service."}
{"text":"First time in Madison, and we ended up eating here twice! We didn't know what to expect about the food in WI. We were a little bit leery about the sound of fried cheese curds until we sampled this WI fav here, and, loved them!

It's easy to see why this casual spot is so popular. With double story windows, during the daytime, it's sunny and there are great views of the capital building (or its reflection)! Great space! Service is friendly and the simple but interesting fare uses local ingredients. In fact, they have a map showing patrons the farms where they source their ingredients. 

Cheese curds were amazing as was the mac and cheese with WI cheddar! Excellent burger, too. They have a nice selection of WI cheese - you can make your own cheese and charcuterie board. We thought the cheese was better than the meats. (We tried the rillette and the coppa. Both were fine, but neither was particularly well seasoned.)

Highly recommend this fun place!"}
{"text":"Cold, cold day in Madison.  Enter gooey grilled cheese with carmelized onions and a bowl of tomato soup.  Wash that down with hot apple cider.  Results in immediate warmth.  Grilled cheese never fails to disappoint me for lunch, and in a state that focuses on cheese, it seemed pretty ridiculous not to have a lunch that was heavy on the cheese."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants from our trip to Madison. The Cheese Kurds were amazing. We also ordered The Graze Burger and Smash Burger. Both were great. Also delicious was the Bimbimbap"}
{"text":"My wife had a delicious waffle as part of their take on chicken and waffles. This was by far the best waffle I've had state side. My Mac and cheese was good. For appetizers we had tasty fried cheese curds. Their deviled eggs were ok. I like my yolkes thick with a bit of chunk, these were smooth. Not what I was looking for but for $3 they were pretty good. The price vs food quality, atmosphere, and service ratio was great and earned these folks a 4. Their outdoor patio overlooking the capitol didn't hurt either."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Graze with large groups a half-dozen times during rehearsals in Madison.  It has always been both fun and tasty.  Sometimes it's noisy, and on very crowded nights it can be too slow.  On the other hand, a slower night will get you fantastic service and their always-good, always-creative food.  The bibimbap bowl is delicious, though on our last visit mine came out undercooked.  No problem -- they took it back and reworked it right away.  Specials are always delicious.  Desserts are amazing.  I wish they would enlarge their menu just a bit:  I've eaten there many times since 2012 and it doesn't seem like it has changed much.  It'd be cool to see a few new and really different things on offer.  The chef is a talented guy and I bet he has a lot more ideas..."}
{"text":"Graze is unique and the food is outstandingly delicious. One of my favorites."}
{"text":"OBSESSED. One of my favorites every time I come into Madison. Cheesecurds and chicken and waffle are muh go to."}
{"text":"Get Syked!  Awesome, Awesome and Awesome!  Forget that fact that's it's a little granola using local ingredients and what not.  You won't find a better dining experience in Madison than Graze.  My friends raved about it and it did not disappoint.  I went for brunch and had the Nutella Stuffed French Toast and it was delicious (with local fruit).  Checked out a lot of plates they all looked amazing, can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu including the award winning burger.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So, they have cheese curds on the breakfast menu. I think that is really all I need to say. ;)  

But really, the cheese curds are amazing, as is everything else I've eaten for brunch there.  I've gone the sweet route and the savory route and never been disappointed.  My favorite part is the list of local providers on the back. I love knowing that Graze supports Wisconsin farmers and food producers.  Check it out. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We stopped in Graze for a drink during happy hour and ended up staying and eating there. The decor is great, it is minimalistic but I like the big chalkboard and the layout of the place. Great atmosphere as well. 

I also like that they have wine taps, haha. I had the house Pinot Grigio and it was really good. I also had the apple cider cocktail which was really yummy!

For dinner my husband had the $20 burger, ha It was pricey for a burger, but he said it was amazing. His fries were good, I tried some:) I had the croque madame and let me tell you, it was probably one of my favorite things I have ever eaten in my entire life! I can't stop thinking about it since we left! I had never had a croque madame anywhere else, but this one was awesome. I will have to get back there to eat one again soon! 

I would definitely check out Graze, they use all local sustainable ingredients as well, which is always a plus."}
{"text":"I believe you pay for the ambiance and the atmosphere at the Graze more than you would for the food. It's a lively and super chic place, but also quite busy on most nights. Therefore, service tends to be on the slower end.

Parts of their menu changes periodically (I believe it's four times a year?). Most of the appetizers and entrees I've had here were okay. As I mentioned, I liked the ambiance more. 

However, my favorite item is the Graze Burger. It is absolutely delicious! I've never had such meat fest concoction of a burger other than at the Graze... Can you imagine bacon, sirloin, ribeye, and short ribs with your burger? Well, give your salivating taste buds a rest and pamper them at the Graze."}
{"text":"This place has AWFUL customer service. Their whole demeanor was that they didn't want us here. We got in the text queue for a table, and they said they would text us. We went for a little walk, and when we returned, 5 min before our estimated wait time was up, they had clearly sat a brand new table (they all had menus and fresh water). Though I was really polite when I pointed it out to the hostess, she played dumb that she had no knowledge of it. At no point did they offer us to wait at the bar or really feel that they wanted any customers. Finally, after another 20 minutes, we finally gave up waiting, largely because we felt so unwelcome. Then the second we said we'd go somewhere else, before I'd even gone 5 feet, I had a text that I had been removed from the list. The owner called me five minutes later to let me know they now had a table, claiming that they hadn't seated anyone despite what I'd seen, and he wanted to change my mind. But he was far from apologetic and I still didn't feel like he actually wanted us to come back."}
{"text":"The cheese curds are amazing. I got them at brunch and at dinner and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"The interior of Graze looks very nice, so my initial impression was a good one.  We came during brunch, and we only waited about 10 minutes for a table.

To start the meal we ordered cheese curds.  They weren't bad, but they definitely weren't worth $9.  My boyfriend ordered a bloody mary and I ordered a beer to drink.  The bloody mary was mediocre.  I wanted to have a burger, but the burger is served on an english muffin.  I asked if I could have a bun instead.  The waitress then informed me that buns would not be available for another hour when brunch was over.  My boyfriend wanted a sandwich, but the honey wheat bread was not appealing to him.  He was informed he could not make a substitution on the bread though.  We then decided to just have the cheese curds and drinks, since the options on the menu weren't appealing to us as is.

We had been done with our food and drinks for 15 minutes before our waitress came by with our check, and we actually had to stop her when she was walking past to get the check.  The people next to us didn't get their check until right after we got ours, and they had been done eating before we even got our cheese curds.

This was a very disappointing dining experience."}
{"text":"Wasn't extremely impressed with all the food that I've tried here but truthfully I like the experience of dining here again to make me keep on coming back. Love the ambiance, the waiters are always super nice and the cappuccino is the best I've had in Madison. This place just has that \"thing\" that appeals to me. 

Food - some of it is a bit perplexing. For example the kielbasa. Don't know how they came up with this dish. You'd think that the actual sausage would be the center of the dish, but instead it's forgotten on the sidelines next to the eggs, bread and potatoes (by the way the bread is so good, we asked for jam to eat with it.) The waffles and chicken had the taste pretty spot on...but the waffle is SO THIN that by the time it reaches your table it's basically lukewarm. Corned beef and hash seemed a bit too small.
On the delicious and not disappointing side: pork bun, cookies and milk, deviled eggs. So...hopefully more things will keep on jumping on this list."}
{"text":"Their cheese curds and view of the Capitol are reasons enough to go! I don't think I've ever had as flavorful cheese curds and I've ate many a curd. Their menu has something for every taste and budget and their staff was attentive and fun! I will definitely go back for more cheese curds and the view!"}
{"text":"I love graze. I love their organic farming approach. I love their wine and local beer list. I love their seasonal menus. I just wish they had a few more items on the menu to pick from. Very good food and lovely ambiance with the tall wines overlooking the state house. Don't invest all of your hard work into your sister restaurant (L'ettoit) and forget about Graze folks! You have a very good thing going on with both!"}
{"text":"Wow. Bebimbap burrito for me, pork shoulder noodle bowl for the wife. Great service, relaxing atmosphere. I also heard the burgers are great on the dinner menu. You gotta go."}
{"text":"I wasn't a fan of the food. I dined on the chicken and pickles which is their version of chicken and waffles. The chicken is pressure cooked/fried and it makes the meat too hard and the overall seasonings were not pleasant. 

The meal is topped with bread and butter pickles and has a side of cinnamon butter and syrup. The waffle was cooked too hard it was like a vanilla wafer cookie with waffle grill marks. 

The drink selection were way too expensive $10, $12 and $16 for drinks the size of shot glasses. 

The atmosphere was nice and the staff was great but none of our party of 10 seemed pleased with their food and most of us had different items. The only person who raved over their food was the short rib burger and I did try it and it was tasty but highly priced at $21"}
{"text":"My first night in Madison on business we stopped at Graze. It appears (by location and billing) to be related to a similar restaurant next door sans the white table cloths. 

The building is glass so you can see inside. Hip would be a good word to describe it. Also, fun and tasty after eating there. 

The hostess took my name and phone number, utilizing a text system to alert us when our table was ready. All of 5 minutes later we sat down. 

The menu has local, fresh, seasonal, and more varied options available. I had the bi bim bop to quell a craving, and my friends had the beet salad, burger, and a pasta dish. All were quickly delivered to our table by our friendly waitress and consumed without much chatter or comment other than 'yum'. We shared a crisp at the end- perfect conclusion to the meal. 

Prices were reasonable, service was great, ambiance was classy and special. I'd be back if I were ever in the area!"}
{"text":"The view at this place is Absolutely AMAZING. Get a seat by the window and enjoy a little piece of Downtown Madison. Food was pretty good. We ordered the Cheese Curds, Burger and Bibimbap. Burger was slightly dryer than anticipated but the Bibimbap is definitely a winner. Cheese Curds were delicious too. Definitely a must try if you are in town!"}
{"text":"Time and time again I'm reluctantly convinced to give Graze another shot and it might be due to the stellar reviews others have left. I've been numerous times and always leave feeling disappointed and as though it is never worth the hour+ wait it takes to get in. The service and drinks are always wonderful but the food is never extraordinary and is always quite pricey, especially the brunch. The one standout has always been the Bibimbap which is my favorite and the only standout in my opinion. However, there are far better restaurants near the square with shorter wait times and better prices. Graze will remain a staple due to its location and owner, but I am constantly let down by the quality of the food compared to other lesser known restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Graze was delicious.  I recommend their oysters.  The atmosphere is pleasant and their menu is all local and fresh."}
{"text":"Sweet mother of fried cheese curds, this place is good.

With a heavy heart & thick blood, I waddled my way into Graze attempting to keep my heart pumping with all of the cheese flowing through my body. Everywhere you go in Madison you have to try the cheese.

I had had some fried cheese curd mishaps. I'm talking about freeze-dried pre-fried sad mistakes for cheese curds. Graze doesn't pull their curds out of a bag and re-fry them. They are most certainly hand-breaded and they might even say a prayer over them before they serve them to you.

Delicious.

We came in for lunch expecting to try the crazy-expensive Graze Burger on a friends recommendation... only to find that it's a dinner-only offering.

Anger.

After deciding not to leave (we almost did), I turned my attention to the breakfast portion of our menu and snagged the Loaded Breakfast Sandwich. While it was no Graze Burger (continued anger), it was a tasty bronze medal (the silver medal was the cheese curds).

The only other thing I had was wonderful but had a bit of a menu snag.

The \"Magic Coffee\" was actually quite tasty. It was a bit pricey at $4.50 (it had to be more iced coffee than espresso, and cinnamon and half-and-half aren't exactly the most expensive ingredients). What really annoyed me was that they had no secondary pricing option for a refill. The cup wasn't the biggest thing in the world, and charging $4.50 for a second helping is just plain terrible restaurant management.

They have to be tossing in 15% or less of the $4.50 ticket price in ingredient costs, so it's silly to use the same pricing on a second glass.

Fix that, Graze. I'd recommend charging $2 or $2.50 for a second glass.

To sum it up: great food at a decent price, but the menu is too restricting. I hope they listen."}
{"text":"Location is great. Everything by the Capitol has something going for it. We liked sitting outside in the shady patio on a hot summers day. And that is about all we liked. 

The Sunday brunch menu was limited. Brunch was the only option at 2:00 pm on Sunday. It does not change to diner until 3:00 pm. 

I ordered a Bagel and Lox and salad, my companion ordered Bibimbap burrito. The lox was inedible. I've had lox many times before. Never had I had lox as salty as a bacon cheeseburger. My partner tasted it and agreed, that it was too salty. When I asked the server about it, she said it was because it was cured. Well, yes, lox is prepared in a brine but it should not be tough to where I need a knife to cut it nor should it taste like a salt lick. Maybe it was prepackaged and sitting for a while or maybe I am spoiled by Jewish delis of Chicago that get lox right, but I could not eat it. The small salad was fine. 

The Bibimbap burrito was not all that. Lots of rice, quoina, dry tortilla. Pork was excellent quality. Probably wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places ever!

Love the use of local ingredients.  I like to sit at the bar and see what they are coming up with in drinks...  so good!

Breakfast, lunch, appetizers, coffee cart, drinks...  everything we've had has been amazing!"}
{"text":"Meh. I haven't been here in awhile, and tonight's visit was horrible. Very sad, considering several good visits I've had.
Our server was terrible, and made no attempt at being pleasant. She seemed miserable, talked very quietly and just didn't seem like she wanted to exist. Never have I had a server who so clearly needed a career change. Also, when we mentioned the over-cooked chicken, she showed no empathy, and merely muttered \"I'm sorry\" and quickly scurried off. It was very odd.
My Mac & Cheese (with pulled pork for extra$) was mediocre, and the pulled pork wasn't very hot. It didn't taste great and was mushy and flavors were muddled. Mac & Cheese is classic comfort food, and this was simply uncomfortable. Not recommended.
One of us ordered the Chicken & Waffles-which is usually delicious-and even that was an overcooked mess! The breading was so crunchy that it was painful to eat, like eating sand.
The bibimbap was also not amazing.
The restaurant remains beautiful, but it gets very loud.
At these prices, the food really should be exceptional. It was not. The service was awful. I appreciate the farm-to-table effort, but this visit wiped away all prior visits I've made to Graze. I'll probably be back again, but pray that this was just an \"off\" night at Graze."}
{"text":"I have brunched all over the country and this is the best damn place out there. The bloodys are to die for (get the infused vodka if they have it!), the eggs benedict are perfection, and the cheese curds are - dare I say it - the best in Madison! If you'd rather do coffee than a cocktail, get that magic coffee. I MISS IT SO MUCH. You can grab one outside to go when they have the outdoor Dane county farmers market. 

My only bad feelings about this place are that they got rid of the potatoes that came with the eggs benedict, which totally bummed me out last time I was there. The side order of hashbrowns they're doing ($6) aren't a good replacement."}
{"text":"Amazing food - one of my absolute favorite places in downtown Madison to eat at.  I absolutely love their menu and unique use of local and farm fresh ingredients."}
{"text":"The saving grace of Graze is the ambiance and the perfect view of the Capitol Building. The food itself was good, but given the amount we paid, it wasn't THAT good. Also, they tried charging more to have what was basically 2 more tablespoons of syrup for my chicken and waffles that was already $20. On a brighter note, the service was excellent and compensated for the small menu and adequate food. All in all, I'd say it's worth a try, but don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday night and were seated right away. I like how the seating is such that pretty much everyone gets a nice view of the capitol. The service was top-notch - very prompt and attentive.

When I asked, our server got me an annotated menu which specified which options could be made vegetarian. I got the Rigatoni, which was ah-maze-ing! The flavors from the spices and the vegetables worked just perfectly with the pasta. I had leftovers for the next day and they were equally good reheated!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. I saw this place on a general TV program called Wisconsin Foodie and I was excited to try this place.  The food was great. The cheese platter was awesome, and the baked mac and cheese was fantastic. The aioli was the best I have ever had. I would recomment this place 100%."}
{"text":"Good service. Very trendy, lots of hipsters and pretentious dbs. But. Good beer selection. GREAT cheese selection and this is the Rome of cheese. Fried cheese curd were extraordinary. The strozzopreti will test your allegiance to the Master Spice."}
{"text":"Some coworkers and I went to Graze for lunch. I like that their menu isnt' too long, they have specials which sound delicious, and you know the food is coming from farms in WI. The food is fresh and taste delicious. I got the Greek Chicken Sandwich...simple but tasty. I got the fries, which were a little boring and very fried (next time I'll opt for the mixed greens). I'd go back again."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Pork buns are fantastic. The gnocchi is very good. The bibimbap is a very interesting interpretation and is worth a try. Graze burger probably a little overrated... Little bit crowded and acoustics a little strange, but a great view and location."}
{"text":"The biggest draw for us was that this restaurant's menu is all local. 

The staff was super friendly and they are very knowledgable about each dish. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all and was perfect for a nice early dinner on the square with some friends.

The cocktails were good. We each had a different one from the menu. Nothing super yummy so we all just ordered one. 

The apps were alright. We had the pretzel with the best creamy cheese you could ever have and some other mustard spreads. Then the pickle platter which was interesting but I'm sure a pickle connoisseur would have loved it! 

Our friends ordered the Mac N' Cheese and the Toasted Farro. My partner and I had the pub burger and a Fried chicken and waffle.

Our friends said they liked their meals but didn't say much else. My partner thought her burger was good and the fries were okay. My fried chicken and waffle were good but again nothing phenomenal. I've had better waffles at IHOP and fried chicken from Church's chicken to say the least.

Again since everything is local - you are paying top dollar for a little bit of food. When the food doesn't seem fantastic then you leave thinking \"Wow, we could have had a more savory meal at home for half of the money.\" 

I was really hoping to taste some magnificent food that would keep me craving more until I came back. This wasn't that experience."}
{"text":"We were in town and this place was recommended to us as some of the best new American brunch places that Madison had to offer. Well, it was pretty good, but I'd rate this as \"would wait 20 min max\" for brunch. We had the chicken and waffle and the signature burger, an overpriced apple cider ($6, non alcoholic), and a plum lemonade that I wish I'd gotten instead. The chicken and waffle dish apparently wins awards every year, but it tasted pretty standard and the meat was dry. I specifically asked what parts are served, and they said one white piece and one dark. Well I got two white pieces, boo. The waffle I left mostly untouched but the bf liked it. I'm not sure this was worth the somewhat steep price tag, when so many other decent places exist around the area. Maybe everyone wants a bite of hipster ambiance? Maybe it was just an off day for their chicken? Maybe I'm just used to San Francisco brunches where you wait an hour but it's actually worth it for the mouthgasms. Unfair comparison, I know."}
{"text":"A must-try foodie spot in Madison. All locally grown and sourced ingredients. Plus the chef is Korean? This explains the Korean dishes on the menu. 

Made the mistake of ordering jjamppong. Great idea for a dish. The scallop in it was the most tender I've had in my life. But the noodles were stuck together and not springy enough. And at $21 a plate, not totally worth it. 

The other things we ordered were five star quality. 

The Graze burger will slap you upside the head and make you realize this is what beef is supposed to taste like. White fish with daikon sprouts had aioli that was very fresh and creamy. The cheesecake was nice and light with really tasty-but-not-too-sweet bourbon cherries. 

Order a \"Spotted\", Wisconsin short-hand for a Spotted Cow Beer. This is an incredibly refreshing beer with a citrusy finish. On the lighter side of beers. 

Not a cheap place but I suppose you're paying for the locally sourced ingredients."}
{"text":"Infiltrated by streams of light, creatively designed, Graze is a beautiful space. While I have not done so yet, I imagine that it is one of the best places to get a drink after work ever.  Graze is gorgeous.

Graze also has highly professional, charming wait staff. 

Graze's food is less consistently excellent, marred chiefly by Graze's ambitions to \"be taken seriously.\" Consider, for example, Graze's pickle plate. Certainly, pickling has experienced a renaissance. And we were carefully told by magazines (three years ago) that it is \"what's hot.\" The truth is, however, pickling is a tricky process. It is entirely too easy to get a brine that is too sweet, too spiced, too salty, and the like. As a result, Graze's pickle plate has six options, two of which are good, four of which are entirely forgettable. Similarly, their noodle bowl was superior, while their tofu club was, well, oily. 

In short, Graze has big dreams, and sometimes it realizes them."}
{"text":"Got to the restaurant at 2:30 Saturday afternoon. Be aware that they only serve brunch until three. So, we got a couple drinks and an order of cheese curds. Honestly, the best cheese curds I have ever had! 
At 3 o'clock, my friend and I placed an order. She got chicken and pickles - which is really chicken and waffles,  and I got the Graze burger. She said hers was great, and I know my burger was awesome! It was a little rich and I think I paid the price later, but boy was it good as I was eating it!! 
I see why this is one of her favorite restaurants!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times since and it's now my go to spot - I come here for the magic coffee which has hints of cinnamon and the Bimbibap with the the mixture of tofu and pork.

I really enjoy the cheese curds here, the Mac and cheese and the pork buns."}
{"text":"Graze was a terrific experience - great service, and excellent and unusual food. We started with a variety of pickles which were all delicious and the assemblage of them was well balanced in flavor and texture. I had vegetarian bibimbap and have been obsessing on it for the past 5 days - fresh crisp veggies, marinated tofu, sauteed greens, the crispiest rice ever, the soft egg mixed into the sauciness... the balance of flavors and textures was wonderful. It was a huge portion, I probably could have shared it with someone else."}
{"text":"Two words: Cheese Curds! The BEST in Madison... Vodka battered, cooked to perfection and served with a delicious ranch.  If you go there! Get them! Service was also great and even though we sat in a corner spot, the ambiance and view was amazing!"}
{"text":"Whenever a friend visit Madison I bring them to Graze. 

It is cheap (for the quality), nice ambience, great food, and it screams Madison in all his flavors. 

I usually start off with one of their Wisconsin cheese selections for the table; these are not your average cheeses. I then often get either their signature burger or their chicken and waffle, my wife likes the bibimbap. But really, all their menu is nice.

Their beers are also a treat!"}
{"text":"FOR PEOPLE WITH ALLERGIES:

We had 2 guys in our dinner group today that had serious dairy allergies and based on the clearly labeled dairy free entrees on the online menu, we decided to dine here. However, once we reached Graze, the waitress and then the manager said they can't make the supposed dairy free entrees without cross contaminating the dishes. This by definition is not dairy free and definitely presents a problem for people with allergies. The restaurant also marks certain tems as gluten free and other allergens free. The manager explained that the cross contamination problem is also at play for these allergens and it would not be safe, for example, for people with celiac disease to dine there. Anyway, the restaurant misrepresents itself as a progressive restaurant that can accommodate allergies, but in reality this is not the case."}
{"text":"Love love love this place, especially for brunch. They probably have the best cheese curds and cheesy hash browns in town! 
Brunch can be crazy busy, and the service can be slow, but it's definitely worth it.
Plus, they have amazing dill and garlic infused bloody Mary's and they make a mean French 75 (not on the menu!)."}
{"text":"Really great spot on the capitol square. Solid happy hour, great dinner options and the view is pretty amazing. Hands down the best fried cheese curds in town - they're huge and the ratio of batter to cheese is spot on. The menu is an interesting mix of classic american food with a little Korean flair - the bibimbap breakfast burrito is a pleasant surprise of sweet and spice. 

We've been a number of times and the only problem we've seen is that service can leave a little to be desired sometimes. It doesn't seem to have anything to do with how busy the restaurant is - in fact we've noticed that the quieter it is there the less attentive the wait staff gets. That said, it's never been bad service, and we LOVE the food, so we keep going back. 

And in case you didn't already make a note - get the cheese curds. They'll change your life."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great staff, great view, and great food. It is however on the pricey side and there is not alot on the menu but good options for vegetarians."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today...nice high ceiling restaurant with an open floor plan.  Wasn't packed but the hostess wouldn't want to give me a table.  I was first offered a bar seat, I asked for a table, then offered a high table seat although there were tables open.  No biggie maybe she was expecting a crowd that never came because tables were open when I left.  
Pork buns - had better like at Ippudo in NYC or even Lucky Belly in Honolulu.  The steamed buns came out mushy, not sure if they were made wrong or the day from the pork made them soggy. 

Sandwich/soup combo - Chicken chipotle soup was the best of the three.  Nice hot soup on a cold day was nice.  It was tasty and had tortilla chips in it. 

- Hot Italian beef sandwich, haven't had an authentic Italian beef sand before but it just tasted off.  

The waiter was attentive and was honest with recommendations.  I like the fact he left a pitcher of water to give me the option of self refill, but I never had to as he came by every time to top it off.   

Full bar with a decent selection of local beers.  Elected to skip this time cause I had an empty stomach and think I was already dehydrated and getting a headache."}
{"text":"I went here with a few co-workers during our business trip. It was pretty good! The deviled eggs and  pretzel were awesome, while the fried cheese curds were pretty average and my mussels were good.  The atmosphere of the people is great though. The natural light from the windows and the great view of the capital building makes this place a great place to go. I was really disappointed at how long it took for our food to come out though. Each appetizer had at least a ten minute wait time between them and we ordered 3 different ones! We were at the restaurant for so long! Nothing too special about this place, but my co-workers and I all enjoyed our meals!"}
{"text":"I have not lived in Madison for almost a decade, but I always enjoyed L'etoile and the little cafe downstairs from the old space where they served fabulous little sandwiches to take back to my desk at the Capitol. So I was excited to try Graze, which is in a soaring space with nice views of the square. 

 We hit Madison just before dinner time, so we ordered from the more limited menu, but there were still plenty of good options. We ordered the pork buns, which were a pretty serviceable knock off of David Chang's Momofuku pork buns, but the slices of pork belly were a little on the skinny side, and I lost the umami hit of a thicker, glistening belly.  We also ordered the cheese curds and deviled eggs as appetizers, both of which were good. The cheese curds were reminiscent of the old Town Talk diner in Minneapolis, and were a little too plentiful for two people but would work for a group. The deviled eggs were a touch mustardy. 

If we had stopped there, I think we would have come away pretty happy, but since we had skipped breakfast and lunch, we ordered the pub burger. Mistake. I was expecting a gastropub-style burger, something thicker and that would showcase the local beef. It turned out that it was basically a slider-style WI bar burger. We ordered it medium rare, but you basically can't cook a thin burger anything less than medium well. The burger was hard and dry, with flavors redolent of sawdust. My wife commented that it left her mouth devoid of saliva. I am sure a local, organic cow began the life cycle of this burger, but you would never know based on the hockey puck outcome. 

I love and support farm to table, and I would come here again to try other dishes, but I would avoid the burger like the plague. Given the quality of the inputs that Graze has, I would expect a little more."}
{"text":"This is one of my many favorite Madison restaurants. I've been here a few times for brunch and dinner and am always happy with my choices. The menu is unique and food is always fresh. Great location being around the capital."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my top brunch places. There's ALWAYS a wait, but the good thing is that they take your number down and will text you when your table is ready! I don't know why more places don't do that. 

Last time I went I ordered their \"really\" magic coffee (alcoholic) and it was AMAZING. Their regular magic coffee is great too, but if you're looking for a boozy brunch, definitely try it! One of my favorite things to order there is the noodle bowl. Honestly, BEST HANGOVER CURE, and it's delicious! Love all of the Korean influenced dishes."}
{"text":"Love the different types of oysters at brunch. Had the big burrito and it was to die for. Very unique drink menu and fresh squeezed juice. Definitely a hit"}
{"text":"Graze has a modern feel to it and is located right in the middle of everything. The food is new-age fusion which is a nice change from the typical cheese-curds and beer, but some of the plates seem to be trying too hard to be hip. 

The food is definitely fun, and the portions are great, but I can't say that the food was great. I probably sound like a tool saying this, but it felt like the dishes were made just so they could label them as organic, local, vegan, etc. There isn't anything wrong with that. I love it when restaurants are accommodating, but flavor shouldn't have to be sacrificed.

Come for the ambiance and to try out new things. Just don't get too hyped up."}
{"text":"Incredibly fresh tasting food. We came for brunch and were surprised the number of choices. From egg sandwich to pork belly noodles, the range was amazing. Only complaint is that the wait was an hour and then our server was impossibly slow. Otherwise, we would come back again."}
{"text":"So good! I spent a few days in WI for work and this spot was a breath of fresh air for this east coast gal. Delicious food, great wine list and beautiful ambiance, literally looks right out on the capital building. I had the noodle soup and the cheese curds, both were out of this world!"}
{"text":"Delicious bibimbop. We sat outside and loved the attentive service. I liked how diverse the menu was, and want to return to try more."}
{"text":"Had the mussels with frites. The chili broth in the mussels was flavorful and light. The frites were perfect and came with aioli for dipping. So much decadence in one little cup!  
The focaccia in the bread basket was tender and flaky and dotted with herbs that made my tastebuds dance!  
Daughter had fried cheese curds and tofu bibimbap - it was so fresh and beautifully presented. 
Our waitress Julia was so sweet and attentive, knowledgeable and helpful. 
A wonderful experience all around."}
{"text":"Delicious! My husband and I stopped in here for dinner on a vacation last week and everything was great. I had the gnocchi with sausage and honeycrisp apple salad and my husband got the garam masala pork. Both dishes were some of our favorite food from our whole trip. Then we split some dessert that was a date cake with peanut butter chocolate gelato. The gelato wasn't necessary, it was ok, but not as good as the cake. 
One thing to note is that this place is popular and they don't take reservations so make sure to budget some time in to wait for dinner. But if the food is this good, it's worth it."}
{"text":"A very awesome vibe to the restaurant. Staff is always very friendly. The drinks are absolutely fantastic, but the food has never impressed me, with the exception of the mac 'n cheese. Graze has the BEST mac 'n cheese I've ever come across (to include my own homemade mac). But that's about the only thing I'll ever order there as an entree. Good sides and mac, but otherwise the food and price aren't worth the trip."}
{"text":"The place is very pretty with a very nice view. The service was also really good. I ordered the 1/2 size cheese curds which was very yummy and a good portion for a half size. For my entree I ordered the seafood stew which cost $27.00. The flavor was on point a little spicy and tasty however I was still hungry because the portion was so small. You get two shrimps, 1 yes 1 scallop and about 4 tiny claims some of which were empty and about 6 very little muscles. The menu said fingerling potatoes however it was more like one fingerling potato cut into tiny pieces. When the waitress came over to ask how was everything I asked if the portion was normal and she said yes. Wow... No way should they be charging that price for such a cheap portion."}
{"text":"Recommend the bibimbap burrito and the noodle bowl. If you like the burrito and are ever in Chicago , check out the Korean tacos at Del Seoul on Clark St. 
The noodles in the noodle bowl weren't the ramen noodles that I was used to but it was cooked just right and the hot chili oil sauce have it a good kick to its flavor. I was disappointed with the cheese curd, too greasy and the sauce tasted weird too me. The chilaquiles also was a disappointment, small meat portion and the triangular sized chips was not a nice change to what I'm used to."}
{"text":"Short story: Eat at Graze, and you will NOT be disappointed.

Long story: We ate at Graze because it was unfortunately on our list of restaurants we have not yet tried in Madison. (Not sure why it was on that list for so long?!) I love the fact that a restaurant is so committed and concerned to working with local farmers to cook with local, quality ingredients. 

We ate the deviled eggs and pork buns for appetizers and the graze burger and cauliflower rigatoni for entrees. Everything was incredible: very fresh-tasting, cooked perfectly and completely delicious. If you're an egg fiend like me, the deviled egg appetizer might make you scream because it's so tasty. 

My only complaint is that the house white wine was very bubbly and almost champagne-y, and I didn't know that when I ordered it. The bartender and the menu did not mention anything about that. I can't complain too much because my wine glass was empty at the end of dinner! :-)

Graze is now on my \"take out-of-town guests here so they can be impressed with Madison\" list along with The Old Fashioned, Eldorado Grill, and a few other Madison favorites. :-)

Great location with big windows. It's a classy and contemporary (but not stuffy) place to go for incredible food downtown! 

We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"Went to Graze last night and saw the Graze burger on the menu for over $20! I thought that is crazy no burger is worth that much money.....I stand corrected that was THE best burger ever and sooo worth the price..period!!"}
{"text":"Really interesting menu.  I liked the gournet grilled cheese.  The flavors were wonderful.  The salad was colorful and unique.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The best cheese curds I have ever had.  Normally I don't use the sauce with the curds but it really enhanced the taste.  The chicken and waffles was good but I was not a fan of the spicy butter.  I will try something different next time I am here."}
{"text":"Started off with the pork buns... kim chee was really overpowering with a big pile of cilantro in one spot.  wasn't organized well because each bite either only had kim chee or pork.  Pork and sauce were both good though.

Secondly I ordered the Pub Burger.  I ordered it medium rare and got it medium well.  I asked for it with no mustard, but the waitress insisted that it was ok because the condiments all come on the side.  Little did I know that the condiments were all sort of mixed together so I had a hard time getting the ketchup/mayo without the mustard.  Bacon tasted very old.

On the side were the fries and aoli.  The aoli was tastless... sort of like mayonnaise. Fries were very over salted and also tasted stale.  I work in a restaurant so I know what stale fries taste like...

Service was very slow...

...not planning on returning for a very long time"}
{"text":"This place has an amazing view of the capital and even more amazing food. Definitely get the cheese curds, duh. Great brunch drinks--- people/staff are always friendly!"}
{"text":"Third time here, which isn't saying much except that I live out of state. Madison has many solid options for food but I just love how fresh and seasonal Graze's menu always seems to be. They do their best to take advantage of Wisconsin agriculture. Today I had the roasted beet salad for lunch which was refreshing on this warm sunny summer day. It paired nicely with New Belgium's flowering citrus ale. Don't worry, I did not skip out on a chance to have a side of Wisconsin cheese curds."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sit-down place in Madison. Food is fresh and local. The service is very informative and can make you feel like each dish has been handcrafted just for you. The first time I ate here i ordered Mac and Cheese and it's still the best mac and cheese I've ever had. Additionally, they supplied me with the best chicken and waffles I've ever had too. I urge anyone in the area to get over to Graze. Its fantastic."}
{"text":"Food is good. I used to really like the cheese curds but they changed the recipe. Unfortunately, there is often a long wait. It's kind of loud."}
{"text":"Outstanding, knowledgable service from Seanna. The best meal in years. I ate the homemade rigatoni with meAtballs and was blown away with delight. Seanna selected our cheese tray and nailed it. One of the best cheeses was made from cow milk, goat milk and sheep milk. We are genuinely sad to only be adding through and to not be able to come back often!"}
{"text":"Their fries are fantastic. Seriously. You'd think a French fry is a fry, but it's not. When I get an entree with fries, I always eat those first. So crispy and salty and hot and not overly greasy. The truffle popcorn is a great snack during cocktail hour. Their cocktails are original and fun. Menus are a bit limited (especially if you're a vegetarian) but what they offer is very good. The atmosphere and view makes up for the limited options. I've had brunch, lunch, dinner, and cocktails there multiple times. Never had a bad experience, although sometimes it takes a while to get your drinks because everyone slams the bar with orders for foo-foo cocktails instead of keeping it simple with wine and beer. Whatever. Sh*t happens. Instead of getting bitchy I do something really drastic: I relax and enjoy the people I'm dining with and admire the view, and if we're going to order a second round, we do it earlier rather than later.  ;)

I also like that they feature local and seasonal foods. Keep doing that."}
{"text":"We had a Thursday night dinner here. Very beautiful, great location and terrific food at fair prices well below it's parent, L'etoile. Graze uses lots of ingredients from local producers (veggies, meats and cheeses). We had the Warm Farro Salad and the gratin with the braised greens. Both were excellent. We plan to go back again as soon as possible for drinks so that we can try some of the interesting items on the drinks menu. I'm curious to find out what mead tastes like (they have two)."}
{"text":"This is my second time here in Madison, and I promised myself that I would check out this spot because of is sustainable, farm to table ingredients. Tonight I chose the wedge salad, pate and gyro meatballs. 

First off, the pate was great. It was wrapped in bacon and served with crostinis, pickles and mustard/fill sauce. 

I also had the gyro meatballs. This was good, too, but I really shouldn't have had both the late AND the meatballs...I am about to burst out of my pants!

Lastly, and most unnotably was the wedge salad. It was their interpretation of this classic salad - mushrooms instead of bacon, sesame ranch dressing and a heaping mound of shredded radish and carrots. Honestly, I would have liked this interpretation of his salad, but the shredded toppings killed it for me. 

Hopefully this isn't my last visit to Madison, and I hope this doesn't turn me away from this restaurant. I would definitely be back to try other things."}
{"text":"I had brunch at Graze, and it was disappointing, closer to 3.5 than 4 stars on my scale. But I trust the L'Etoile team enough to give them another shot, probably for dinner, a menu that looks more interesting.

I had the pub burger, which was quite good but not great, while the fries were a little salty for my taste, but the aioli was a very good complement. Also tried a bit of a co-eater's ramen noodles with pork, which was better with some hot pepper sauce, but not special either.

In terms of atmosphere, the place is very nice and open, and it was a great setting for a summer morning by the farmers market."}
{"text":"Hello chicken and waffles ($18 hot chicken & pickles)!  These may be the best chicken and waffle I've had.  The chicken was tender and juicy with crispy breading.  The waffle was equally as good.  I'm not a huge pickle fan, but the pickles added a delightful and surprising dimension to the dish.  

Popcorn $4 - I love popcorn and truffles, so this was a great appetizer to snack on.  It could have used more truffle oil.
Hand-cut Fried $5 - Crispy and addictive.
Pork buns $6 - Pork belly, kimchi, hoisin and cilantro.  The buns were fluffy and the filling was savory.

{"text":"Wonderful view, great ambiance. Prices are a bit high and some of the food is pretty over the top but a solid place with average service."}
{"text":"Love.  Great food, awesome bartenders, beautiful space.  One of the best in Madison."}
{"text":"Given Graze's association with L'Etoile, we had high hopes. But there were some things that fell short. First, our server lacked knowledge of the menu. We asked about the sweetness level of different cocktails and he said he did not know, without offering to get the opinion of the bartender. We asked about his preferences between different dishes and he said that he had never tried them. 

The food was hit and miss. I could eat baskets of the friend cheese curds like they're going out of style. The ramen was good but I was disappointed with the amount of meat. I'm drawing a blank a week and a half later about hubby's dish so maybe it wasn't that memorable? Hubby was a big fan of his bloody. I was impressed with the garnish. We ordered beignets for dessert and they were ok but not as fluffy as the real thing. Our lunch was a little pricey and I'm not sure we'd make it a point to come back here unless we're making another trip to the Farmer's Market."}
{"text":"I come to Madison on occasion for business. Whether eating alone or not, this place is reliably delicious. My favorite dish is the bibimbap, and pork buns are also terrific. My server was solicitous and prompt (I was there before 6 for dinner), and the light and the people watching is very good.  Always enjoyable."}
{"text":"The food was expectingly good. The cheese curds were awesome. For my entree I got the Korean bbq sandwich. It had slow roasted pork, kimchi and some other stuff. I didn't give Graze 5 stars because of the kimchi. It wasn't kimchi. The fermented, pickled flavor wasn't there. I'm pretty sure it was just fresh cabbage with the kimchi spices. Pretty disappointing."}
{"text":"Tory Miller and his team can do no wrong!  We went here on a Monday late afternoon last week to celebrate our wedding anniversary.   We shared the pork buns (so much flavor in the pork!), kimchi deviled eggs (not too spicy) and cheese & charcuterie board. 

The food was fresh and delicious.   The service was in spot.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and kept checking in to make sure everything was good.  Because of the timing of the day we are off their other hours menu.  We've been here in the past to enjoy their lunch and full menu.   There is a reason this is consistently one of Madison's top rated restaurants."}
{"text":"This is really a 3.5 Star review. 

First off went during the brunch menu time on a Sunday. So menu was limited. I ordered the Bibimbap burrito. My son ordered the chicken n pickles (chicken n waffles) while I really enjoyed my meal; my son's chicken was the driest, stringiest chicken that I've ever seen. Just brutal. 

I had the lavender lemonade btw...fresh and very tasty. Tasted homemade. 

The atmosphere is urban semi upscale and located right next to the capital. Two whole walls are glass and the capital building fills the view. Very cool. The crowd was predominantly 20 something's that were dressed on the nice/stylish end of casual. 

I thought the prices a tad high for the food but not outrageously so. 

If you go imho you will not regret it...but I cannot guarantee that you'd go twice."}
{"text":"Graze is an upscale farm-to-table bistro located on in a modern glass building on capitol square. I had their green salad with champagne dressing, which was incredibly tasty. The tomatoes were fresh, crisp and sweet. 

I also tried the \"pork buns\" which were pieces of pork belly in doughy biscuits - really delicious. The other folks in my party weren't crazy about their food and the prices are high. 

I had to give 3 stars due to the poor service. The waitress was cold, and made herself extremely scarce. The dinner turned into a 2 hour ordeal (without dessert)."}
{"text":"Came here on the suggestion of a local when we were hangry and needing brunch.

We had:
Espresso and coffee
Beignets - divine
Curds - a bit too large for my taste, but incredible
Coffee- a nice, strong roast
Chilaquiles - PERFECTION
Bibimbap burrito -- the crispy rice was a super nice touch - lovely

I've been to the owner's other spots in town, and just like those, this didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Corey D and I headed here for a late-ish dinner during my quick trip to Madison and boy, this place was hoppin'! With good reason I see... The food is delish, the service is friendly, the drinks are creative, and starting at 9 pm Sundays through Thursdays they have a buy 1, get 1 happy hour. 

I had fried pickles, cheese curds, and a beet salad and I would be a happy camper to return here and eat again. Bonus: they have wine on tap which is always a good thing in my opinion.

Definitely well worth a try if you are in Madison and looking for good food + good drinks."}
{"text":"I got the veggie pub burger which was a beet and walnut patty on an english muffin. It was a unique combination and it caught my eye. I loved the patty; it tasted good and you could actually taste the beet root. The english muffin as the bun was not a great idea; i think a typical bun would be the best idea still. 

I also got their popcorn which the waiter said was the best popcorn he has ever had and it honestly kind of sucked. It was basically small popcorn with cheese sprinkled on top of it. I personally would not recommend the popcorn"}
{"text":"Oh my this place is to die for. Totally worth the wait. If there is one restaurant one must try in Madison, this is it. 

For appetizer, I had the fresh oysters. Love the Maine oysters they had. There were so fresh and yummy. 

The chicken and waffle is unbelievable. The chicken is so crunchy and moist yet it is not oily. 

Can't wait to get back there again to try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"We were told about this resturant by many of our friends.  We decided while running some errands downtown to stop in and give it a try.  The place was closed last time for some remodeling.  The place was bright, vibrant, and very clean.  It was definitely a modern style, fancy style place.  A little uppity I think for just normal folks wanting to stop in here.  Awesome views of the Capital and views of the hustle and bustle of downtown life.  That is the reason for the 3 stars.
The menu was very small.  I almost thought when we sat down that we were given a lunch menu. Or specials of the day menu.  However, it was thier full dinner menu.  Not many things to choose from.  I understand what they do they do fresh and homemade.  But damn there was nothing to choose from.  They had a bigger beer selection than food.  We had the pretzel which was light and soft served with several mustards.  It was ok.  We had the vodka cheese curds which were uniquely pleasant.  We enjoyed those being they had a different twist  with.the vodka flavored batter to them paired with a homemade Ranch dipping sauce.  Last we shared the Mac-N-cheese.  Not our favorite, but again homemade with a twist of the cheese they used.  We thought it was dry and the noodles were a little undercooked.  Small portion!  
We saw lots of good reviews of this place.  We decided that it was worth the stop, but not a place that we would have to go back too.  Service was very friendly and at tentative.  No complaints on that end of it.  We came we saw.  Alot of competition around thier location that also serves fresh food, cheaper prices, good cold beers, but much more menu items to choose from."}
{"text":"YUM! YUM! YUM! YUM! 

As a visitor to Madison, I ate with some work colleagues at Graze on a Monday evening.  We were lucky enough to start our dinner during happy hour (great local beers at buy one -get one? Ok, I'll have a few).  Not only was the drink and beer list artisanal, there was a fine selection of wines as well--something for all diners.  Even though it was busy were were able to snag a reservation and have a great, centrally located table for 10.  Our service was impeccable, as was the meal.

We started with a few appetizers--deviled eggs, pickle platter and the vodka-battered cheese curds. All delicious, I really liked the presentation and selection of pickles, but the true star was the vodka-batter cheese curds.  I had tried curds a few other places (all good), but these were next-level--super light and crispy batter with the stringy, fresh hot curd.  I STILL dream about these a month later.  I might be able to live off these alone for a month or so (until my hear gave out).

Dinner was great. I was torn between the lamb and the mac and cheese with pork--the waiter was very helpful in describing the various dishes, and I decided while in Wisconsin, better eat as much cheese as possible. The mac and cheese was very rich, great sauce and al dente pasts topped with a large amount of bbq-sauced pork. The sweetness of the bbq sauce played well against the richness of the cheese.  Really good.  If I am ever lucky enough to be back in Madison, I want to try the bibimbap--several diners with me got it and raved about it.  The gnocci also looked light and delicious (and lived up to their appearance according to another dining companion).

The dessert list was very tempting, but after several beers and a dairy cow's daily cheese production, I opted for affogato (ice cream topped with espresso)--delicious end to a great meal."}
{"text":"This is a great place to relax with friends, enjoy some drinks and some really good food.

The food here is pretty good. And they make really good drinks. But my favorite aspect of Graze is the view. The entire building is essentially glass windows and you can sit in the restaurant and enjoy great views of the Capitol. 

The wait when we arrived was about 25 minutes, which wasn't too bad for seven o'clock on a week night. We ended up sitting at the bar and sharing three appetizers. The soft pretzel, deviled eggs and the bread basket. I really wanted a mojito, which wasn't on the menu but the bartender gladly made one for me. It was easily the best mojito I had had in a while. Can't remember the last time my mojito was made with brown sugar. If you can't already tell, I really enjoyed that drink.

For dinner, I had the sweet potato pancakes. I was able to enjoy the breakfast comfort food but it also really felt very appropriate for dinner. The pancakes were coupled with a sunny side up egg and vegetable hash. The entire meal was just perfectly suited for the beautiful environment. 

This is a must visit AGAIN. Enjoy Graze!"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends for some drinks and appetizers and had a nice time. Great place for a more trendy and upscale experience. I mainly wanted a few drinks, but couldn't pass on trying some appetizers. I had the mac n cheese with pulled pork. The mac n cheese was incredibly good, as was the pulled pork, but I definitely preferred the mac n cheese by itself. If I ordered it again, I would ask for extra bread crumbs...no pork. 

I also ordered the Elderflower margarita, which was pretty good. One of my friends ordered the popcorn with truffle oil, which I thought was \"ok\". It definitely had a nice flavor, but I think some of the other menu items would have been a better choice. Another one of my friends ordered the cheese curds, which were the best I've had so far in Madison.

I defnitely want to go back when I'm more hungry and try the Moules Frites, fried chicken and waffle, and Graze burger. Also, they have a great dining specials, one of which includes oysters and infused vodka shots!"}
{"text":"OK.  This seems to be place of the moment for the critical review.  Had lunch earlier this week with attorney friend.  Reuben and Bahn Mi.  Just fine.  Frites and aoli were nice on the side.  Sat outside and had to ask for missing items from our otherwise attentive server.  When we arrived and went inside,  a server ordered us to stand by the host station to wait for a table.  Neither of us are used to be ordered around so we  had a smirk on that.  No dessert except cookies (huh?)

Cruised by last night (Saturday) at about 6:30 and saw outside tables were open.  Parked our truck on the Square right across the street under threatening tow away signs.  Inside was fairly busy and we wanted to sit outside so there we went right-a-way.  Instructed the server on a double Grey Goose on the rocks with a splash of home made raspberry lemonade.  #1 always sweetie ordered a Sidecar which seemed to perplex the server.  Both were perfectly executed and server said she got a taste of the Sidecar.  By happy coincidence, two of our best carousing compadres walked in and joined us.  This required five chairs at the table as my honey had to put her injured leg up.  No problem.

Server did not tell us about specials until asked.  We had the onion rings and some BBQ chicken wings to start.  Cleaned up on those.  We had one mussels and frites, two Graze burgers (the $20 versions) and one halibut special.  Mussels were great.  My buddy and I agreed the burgers were of excellent quality and perfectly cooked at rare-medium rare.  We also agreed they were a bit bland, needing something more than the onion mix on top, some crusting of the meat or, we said, even some salt would have helped.  The halibut looked kind of like a lemon bar square.  We got a \"fine\" from other buddy eating it, but nothing more for enthusiasm.  We had separate places to go and rolled out about 8:30 or so.  Inside was rockin' and outside full though the mosquitoes were swarming by then.

In the interest of full disclosure, we had four cocktails, five glasses of wine, I believe, the two starters and the four entrees.  No dessert or coffee.  Our bill was $180 and being the good and experienced diners we are, we left $40 for our fun server (even with the lapse on the specials) and she told us to come back anytime we want.  Yup $220 for two hours.  That would have been dinner for four at L'Etoile in the old days.  But it ain't the old days anymore.  I don't have a bitch about prices or the quantity of the food as others seem to have.  I would say you get what you pay for Graze.  If you don't want to pay like this, don't go.

They lost a star for some lapses in service and they need something to work towards overall.  Also, you can't order a couple of self-important attorneys around without consequences.  

(Not sure about that lemon square halibut either.) 

Truck was right where we left it when we returned to it after dinner."}
{"text":"Brunch was awful, service was slow, waiters were judgmental, but I'd go back for the laughs."}
{"text":"Excellent place for brunch or dinner! Great ambiance and the glass panels make the place feel very open.  The patio in summer is the perfect place for a drink in the sun!"}
{"text":"The fried cheese curds were out of this world. The brunch menu was so full of interesting options I could hardly narrow it down. The bibimbap burrito was great. Looking forward to eating there again soon"}
{"text":"I love the style of this place but the burgers, fries and curds I've had there have been really greasy. Love the look and style of the place though and will be back. Just not my favorite. The view of the Capitol is beautiful."}
{"text":"Wonderful food, drinks, recommendations, and service! Stopped in for dinner while passing through Madison. I was by myself so I just ate at the bar. Tyler hooked me up with the drinks I asked for and suggested some interesting twists which I enjoyed. I tried the cheese curds (a first for me) and they were delicious! He also helped me decide on a dinner dish and the gnocchi did not disappoint! It was truly amazing! Would definitely stop here again if I'm in town. Great ambience and great music too"}
{"text":"Local ingredients helps with their amazing meal options.   They have done a great job at keeping the price in an average to lower cost with the down town scene.  Brought together with great service, this has become a Madison staple for me."}
{"text":"I've had the chance to dine here more than a few times now and have a pretty good impression of the restaurant, its service and its food. Overall, I think it strives to offer a restaurant experience a bit outside of the ordinary for Madison, but the ambition isn't matched by its execution.

Most recently, I put together a small group for dinner during one of their Wednesday night concert on the square menus. I reserved a table in advance through a hostess on the phone approximately 3 weeks before, who suggested that I arrive a little early before the seating (630) so I would have a choice of tables.  This turned out to be unnecessary since they had reserved a table with my name up front next to the fence of their outdoor dining area. There also isn't any advantage to sitting closer to the street, since one can't really see much of the orchestra above all the other attendees in the square who bring their own chairs and refreshments. The music is amplified through a PA, so everything is easily heard front and rear of the patio dining area. 

Unfortunately, there wasn't an amuse offerred nor any table snacks during the 30 minute wait before food (a 4 course fixed menu), so it's best not to arrive too hungry. Cocktails are offerred but - even with 4 servers covering approximately 32 diners - it can take awhile to get them. 

The food is well put together and well seasoned. A generous cheese plate delighted, a flavorful bourbon pork loin on polenta was filling if served a little too cold, and a frito misto with calamari and tomatos was very tasty, if also too cold. The problem is the restaurant chose to serve as if catering an event rather than cooking to order. Each course came out at once for everyone, rather than FIFO. This also had the unfortunate impact of serving those that had waited the longest (the earliest arrivals), last, since they were farthest from the kitchen. It made me wonder if they had chosen to forego an expediter. 

Dessert was a moist little chocolate cake square, served with some rather ho-hum cherries, a rossette of cream and no sauce. Not bad, just underwhelming and further contributing to the feeling of eating banquet food. 

A wine pairing erred on the sweet side, though saved by a refreshing French rose choice.  

I noticed a larger party at a table close by received additional baskets of fried things from the kitchen, choices which weren't offerred to us, their drinks were refreshed faster and they always got their food first. Friends of the chef, perhaps, but it sure made me wish we had stopped at one of the many little food stands out on the square and noshed instead. If I find a reason to go to this event again, I'll do that. 

Previous meals were in the same ball park: imaginative pub fare with upscale designs, junior varsity service and a great beer selection. I'd go back, but probably not until after I've explored the many other dining options downtown."}
{"text":"Graze is still my go-to place for fresh farmer's food, particularly the vegetarian in me. I did however have one of their seafood stews and oh boy-- it didn't end well."}
{"text":"Bom restaurante. Um pouco escuro de mais mas com comidas boas. Os mexilhões são. Em apimentados e o hamburger um pouco oleoso mas com muito sabor."}
{"text":"I loved the burger with the brioche bun substitute.  Locally sourced ingredients and all of that other organic, good for the environment and good for you stuff that today's society idolizes.  Hell, even my to-go coffee lid was biodegradable.  Lunch was not as good as a previous time I went here and had brunch, but it was still excellent.  They were incredibly accommodating with my fiance (allium allergy), and they were able to make her the bibambap (sp) in a custom manner.  Overall, I highly recommend this place if you are visiting Madison!  Thanks for reading."}
{"text":"I had the sage sausage with a glass of Malbec. It was delicious! Very moist and savory sausage with tasty side of cauliflower, sweet potato, and kale. More casual style dining, beautiful views."}
{"text":"I promised I'd write an update - keeping three stars for Graze. I'll come here occasionally, but it's not a favorite.

We did an cheese curd taste-off between Old Fashioned and Graze. Old Fashioned won hands-down. Graze's food is just so greasy.

Their cheese selection is solid and the chicken and waffles are killer, but otherwise things are fairly mediocre. Cocktails are so-so. 

They do have a new happy hour from 4-6, and a cool oyster special on Wednesdays with free shots, but after further review, $27 for a dozen is pretty spendy."}
{"text":"I want to begin by saying  the food and the view of the capital were amazing.  We only had a few appetizers, but they all came out hot and delicious.  Don't overlook their popcorn.  It was served in a large portion with plenty of delicious SarVecchio cheese and truffle oil.  Yum.  We also had the cheese curds, which in some establishments can be boring and predictable.  Not here.  The breading was amazing, and the cheese was top notch.  We had a few incredibly friendly and helpful male bartenders.  Unfortunately, they left about half way through our visit, and were replaced by a horribly rude female bartender.  She cut me off abruptly, rolled her eyes, and sighed impatiently when I couldn't pronounce one of their beers (Ouisconsing?  Sorry, I didn't instantly get that one!)   She is the only reason I am taking away stars on the review, because the other bartenders were so amazing...someone has to get that woman a quaalude before the next dinner service!

Excellent bottle and draft beer menu, and their tap house wine was surprisingly high quality. The appetizers were plentifully portioned, and MOST of their servers were top-notch.  

Here goes my rant:

I am not taking away stars on this review because of the positive stories I have heard from many friends who enjoy coming here regularly.  I think my experience may have been singular.  We sat at the bar and had a few drinks with our apps.    Unfortunately, a woman felt it would be appropriate to bring her sons to the bar to squeeze into the only open seat next to us, one an infant and one maybe 5,   Okay...  After her infant son nearly knocked over my wine and grabbed my silverware twice, I politely moved my things over about a foot, crowding our own area to avoid a disaster.  Next, her 5 year old son squeezed in between my knees and the bar, kicking my hanging purse with a rhythmic motion.  I quickly unhooked it and put it in my lap.  All the while, I could still feel his hair on my legs and an occasional bumping of his elbow.  OKAY... She finally left, without a word of apology, not even an apologetic smile. 

That's my rant on that particular subject.  I think it is perfectly okay to bring your children to any establishment you like, as long as you are able to control them and not hinder anyone else's dining experience.  End of story."}
{"text":"After moving to the Madison area, one place was recommended to my husband and I more then any where else - Graze. We had an opportunity to check it out while I was downtown for a work event this past summer. It did not disappoint. 

We started off with the cheesecurds. They were excellent! Best we have had in Madison - we can say that honestly as we had had cheese curds at two other places just the week before. :) 

We paired them with beer of course. I went with a light brew, my husband got the stout. They were both great. My husband liked the beer but was disappointed with the head on his beer, when the server asked and my husband relayed his disappointment the server offered to replace the beer. Great service! 

Ordered burgers, again, they came highly recommended. They did not disappoint. The aioli was to die for.  

The atmosphere is open and urban. I wouldn't bring my kids, but there were kids there. Pricing is right on...I don't feel I need to say more, when a restaurant is this on point the stars speak for themselves!"}
{"text":"Pros
Nice space
Pleasant staff
Cons
The Pub burger is very mediocre,and should have been alot better.It
Came on an un-toasted English muffin with some of the worst fries possible,soggy and limp.....they need to have a little more attention to detail before things leave the kitchen."}
{"text":"Dined at Graze last night for the first time. Unimpressed. The food was on the average side of good but the experience was marred by the beyond rude bartender and a tremendous wait for a table. Tables I might add that appeared to be open for nearly 30 minutes before we were seated. With the myriad of options in Madison; I doubt we will return."}
{"text":"I really like Graze. I've been a couple times now - once for dinner and once for drinks - and both times I was impressed by their excellent service. Oh, and the view of the capitol is AWESOME! Prices are just fine, especially for such a swanky-feeling place. I go here when I want to feel fancy but don't want to feel broke afterward. It's classy but quite down to earth - a good combo.

The only thing is that I actually haven't been super impressed with is their food. When I went for dinner, my companion and I both agreed that our dishes weren't really anything special. I will probably return to confirm - maybe it was just what we ordered. 

But for drinks, I would say that if you're entertaining guests to Madison, this would be the spot to go."}
{"text":"On January 2nd, our favorite dinner place was closed, so we consulted Uncle Yelp for guidance. Based on the simple menu and emphasis on local sourcing, we went with it.

We started with charcuterie and an order of the roasted vegetables. Based only on these dishes, I was leaning towards a three-star experience (spoiler: I was  delighted in the end). We went with coppa, lamb, duck and pate. The meats were nice overall but the pate was bland. The mustard and pickles were uninspiring, so it wasn't the usual experimentation I enjoy with a good meat or cheese board. The roasted vegetables - carrots, celeriac, turnip, and others - delicious ingredients, but drowned in butter.

But then: entrees. My husband had the burger and I chose the bibimbap. The burger ground included shortribs and bacon, and it was blended just enough to stick together well, but coarse enough that you experienced different tastes with each bite. Maybe the best burger I've ever tasted! The bibimbap was great. I opted for ground pork, and there was a ton. The dish could feed me for two dinners, but my husband saved the day and finished it.

Drinks - husband tasted a sour ale, loved it. I got a cocktail with rye and bitters, very nice.

Dessert - apple pie al a mode, and amaro. Great crust on the pie.

The service was very attentive, and we appreciated that they kept the water pitcher on the table."}
{"text":"My husband and I was passing through Madison for our anniversary getaway..decided have lunch her with a friend. The view here of the capitol and downtown Madison was lovely. The food was great, we all had the Wisco with side of curds and fries! The curds was yummy(we've never had them so couldn't compare to others), but could do w/o the dipping sauce. The tomatoe soup was perfectly creamy. All in all, pretty solid lunch!"}
{"text":"Great brunch! Dined here with my family after a wedding. Amazing view of the Capitol building. 

We really enjoyed the locally sourced ingredients. One of us had some dietary restrictions and the server and kitchen staff created something great for her to eat. LOVED the burrito for brunch. However the loaded sandwich (forget the name) had way too much butter on it. Made it hard to eat. But that was the only downside. 

There was a little bit of a wait, but they text you when your table is ready. Great way to notify the guest. 

Definitely would check this place out for another meal to see what else they offer."}
{"text":"Pulled pork mac and cheese was delicious. Came here with parents."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing! Really enjoyed the food. The staff was very nice too. Highly recommend the cheese curds and chocolate chip cookies!"}
{"text":"Nice location and lively atmosphere. The food was ok. Had to try the biscuits and gravy, good,but not traditional. Also tried the beet burger bc it sounded interesting and I love beets. Very dry and not much flavor. Would not go back if we are in Madison again."}
{"text":"My sister and I had lunch here yesterday in their outdoor courtyard, which afforded excellent people-watching and views of the capitol building. I had been longing for a menu with a little flare of creativity after a few days on my trip of indulging in the down-home pleasures of fish fry and smoked ribs and cheese curds: Graze offered some nice variety and color. I had the beet and walnut burger, which was flavorful albeit a little more oily than I expected. The pretzel with mustard and cheese on the share menu was really awesome, definitely the highlight. My sister had the black currant lemonade and grilled cheese-both tasty. The waiter was very easy-going and warm."}
{"text":"I was here on a Saturday night. Expecting a wait is normal for a weekend evening. We were told 30 minutes, because we had a group of 6. They have mostly smaller tables so we were waiting for them to put together tables for us.  Well, 30 minutes went by and the hostess told us 10 more minutes. We thought OK, fine, we've waited this long what's 10 more.  After about 15 more we went up to him and he said another 10 minutes.  So, do your math and that's 55 minutes and we're still not sitting down.  I went up and stressed some sense of disappointment and the hostess showed no sign of apology.  We thought maybe the server and food will make up for it.  Nope, sadly disappointed we waited just about an hour for a bland place.  Overall, myself and the 5 others won't be going back."}
{"text":"On a recent work-related trip to my old undergrad stomping grounds, we had a lovely dinner at here.  It was good to see that L'Etoile was still open (some of my friends worked there years ago), and to find this more affordable gastropub next door.

We had a mixed green salad with shaved carrots, Parmesan, and a champagne vinaigrette.  This salad was simple and very good.  It would have been even better served with some fresh bread and butter, but I didn't order the bread basket because we had already eaten at a half-price appetizer happy hour, and I had had some conference-sponsored nibbles and drinks on top of that.

This restaurant was warm and cozy inside on a cool spring evening, affording a great view of the capital building.  It was Friday night, and it was WI, so of course there was Friday night fish fry, which is exactly what Frank ordered--poor San Antonio-born thing had never had it before.  My appetite still felt a bit dainty, so I got a three-cheese plate with walnut bread and a delicious currant jam.  I tried to vary my cheese course in a pleasing way, ordering a light goat cheese with a vein of stilton running through, a mild gouda, followed by a sharp cheddar.  These were very good, but Frank's fish fry was delicious.  The fish was not greasy at all, and the light, I'm sure beer-based batter stood away from the fish, creating its own crispy case.  I wish I could learn how to fry fish so well.  

Because of our earlier noshing, there was no room for dessert, but I look forward to returning!  I always love visiting good ol' Madison."}
{"text":"His business plan is far better than the food. 

A hip location and popular chef command long lines and high prices. A good bartender and somewhat creative cocktails help. 

Salad = dreadful. Browned apple slices under a massive pile of bitter greens with a bacon vinaigrette that tasted like a bottle of liquid smoke are not creative. The favors were imbalanced. 

Bibimbap was tasty, with clever fried rice cakes, but the presentation was simple, with everything piled on top. It was almost as tasty as the bibimbap on Korean Air, which was better presented."}
{"text":"We've always wanted to eat here, but we don't end up on the square all that often.  We stopped down so my wife could take care if some work business, and she put our name in.  After a short wait, we entered the doors of Graze.  Our server was very friendly and prompt.  We ordered the cheese curds to start.  They were so good, and the house ranch was delicious.  My wife ordered the grits and pulled pork, one daughter had the egg and bacon ramen, and the other had the chicken and biscuits.  I ordered the smashburger and fries, which I heard about and really wanted to try.  Everyone enjoyed their food, although my daughter had a little difficulty cutting the chicken strips that were with the biscuits.  My burger was delicious.  I thought the fries tasted a little limp (not all of them), but they were still fantastic with the aioli.  I was also a clean plater, so obviously I still liked them.  I think the server could have checked on us to see if we needed anything else to drink, that would be the only constructive criticism I would add.  He left a pitcher of water at our table, but we emptied it about halfway through our lunch.  Overall, we had a great lunch at Graze, and the menu is still going through my head as I think about what I would order next time...probably the hot chicken.  Thanks Graze!"}
{"text":"Good food and some nice different options. All was done well and great service. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Lovely space, environment and great dishes on the menu.  My waiter was fabulous and very fun.  Great location and vibe.  I beat the rush and they sat me promptly at a table for one.  Staff were professional, warm and hip without being snooty.  I like that in a cool place.

I suspect if I had ordered something else on the menu, I would have rated them 5 out of 5. Unfortunately, my entree was an interesting but poorly seasoned expensive meal.  I had the blowfish tails on a bed of tasteless bulgar wheat and vaguely spiced vegetables.  The wheat was almost cold breakfast cereal in texture and seasoning. The flavors didn't groove and it simply was not worth the price.  The smoked deviled eggs were amazing, however.

At this level, no dish should go out of the kitchen unless it is top notch.  Graze sure has a successful hiring and staffing model when it comes to the front of the house.  The farm to table groove is totally in line with the way we eat back home on the left coast.  However there is no excuse for a poorly designed entree, especially at a high price point."}
{"text":"ambiance is great.  Beer and drinks are fabulous.  But the food was just OK for us.  I had the Bibmibap and it just didn't make an impression.  My husband had the regular burger, and he thought it was good.  Of course we will return, but in hopes that our meal will leave a better impression."}
{"text":"Bring a lot of money for brunch if you're hungry, the portion sizes are for teenage girls.  Also, the prices on their menu in person are all higher than on the online menu...surprise!

The biscuits and gravy were incredibly sad looking and embarrassing for the $10 price tag.  Four tiny biscuits that are flatter than a pancake, literally.  I have to wonder if the chef was trolling me, having a bad day, or forgot the baking powder...or if they're just too lazy to make a proper flaky biscuit with good rise.

So many better places for brunch in Madison, will not be back and can't recommend."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicago and on our way back from a weekend trip to Wisconsin, my husband convinced me to stop for brunch in Madison.  A friend of a friend of someone is involved with this place somehow so we decided to stop in and I am so glad we did.

We were seated right away and the vibe of this place is so cool.  No offense but I did not feel like I was in Wisconsin at all, it felt like a downtown Chicago restaurant.  Very modern and even though it was kind of rainy outside, the huge window were great.  The bar is very cool looking and everything was really sophisticated.

I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was like a farmers market just dumped a sample into my glass, it was overwhelming, in a good way of course.

My husband got the chicken fried steak and I got the fried chicken and waffles.  Nothing like a healthy, light brunch to get you going.  I never understood the appeal of chicken and waffles but let me tell you now, I get it.  The skin on the chicken had cinnamon and some other stuff in there that just went so freaking perfectly with the waffles and the cinnamon or something or other butter.  Wow, it was good.  I'm very much a fan and would absolutely love to come back to try dinner at this place."}
{"text":"Graze is the best restaurant on the Square. 

Amazing views, cool vibe, and killer food. 

The brunch menu is lights out. Turn the lights off because that is how good brunch is. No lights. Get the breakfast sandwich. Or regret your whole life. 

Great wait staff and hostesses and bartenders. 

If there is one restaurant to visit in Madison while you are here then make it Graze."}
{"text":"Graze has offered a superb experience with each visit. The brunch is a must when visiting Madison, and I have never been disappointed. The coffee tastes fresh, the cheese curds are outstanding, and the biscuits and gravy make my heart feel warm. I will continue to go back!"}
{"text":"Good food! It can be a little expensive, but quality. The cheese curds were worth the buy. They have a good happy hour, but otherwise, I've never been here for a meal. As a student and then young professional starting out, it was just too expensive."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service, and didn't break my bank. Had a really pleasant evening there. The wait wasn't too bad, there's free music concert on Kings street and the summer and collective next to it, or the bar inside the restaurant. plenty of options to spend the waiting time. Enjoyed the view of the capitol very much during my meal."}
{"text":"This place was way overhyped for me. Everyone kept telling me how good this place was and the reviews are really good here too. But when I went, I thought it was \"A-Ok.\"

I had the Graze burger and I couldn't really tell what was so great about it. I got to try the Bibimbap here too and that was much better in my opinion. It wasn't like the traditional bibimbaps because the rice was fried and it didn't have the traditional toppings, but it was pretty good. The cheese curds were ok too. I think the Old Fashioned was better.

I have to say though, the physical place is pretty nice. I came for dinner and it was dimly lit, but still seemed lively. There's also a great view of the capitol.

I don't think this place is worth it though to come back for me. It was nice to try once though."}
{"text":"Excellent!  Stumbled across this place on trip to Madison - I may have to do a road trip just to return to Graze!  Beautiful view of the capital in a trendy atmosphere.  Server was just wonderful and very knowledgeable about everything on the menu.  The beet salad is an explosion of diverse flavors and textures: sweet beets and figs, buttery crunchy crostini, creamy goat cheese - wow!  Being informed that the Graze Burger won best burger in the U.S. by James Beard, I had to give it a try - it held up to that reputation!"}
{"text":"Update:
Having eaten here multiple times now, my experience is now a little more modest.

The Graze Burger is solid, but I realized it was a sloppy mess the 2nd time around.
The bibimbap is probably the best Korean dish in Madison, which isn't saying much. The pork and crispy rice make it pretty interesting.
The chicken & waffles are superb, as well!

The cheese curds are not my cup of tea. Something about the breading is just too thick. The cheese part of it is very good, though. 
But, if you want a really good appetizer, go for the pork buns.

The prices are affordable and portions are filling, especially for a premier Capitol restaurant. There is always a long wait (we were trying to get dinner on a Saturday evening) but it is well worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome!  GREAT burgers.  Superb service.  Nice view of the capitol.  

We had guests from out of town about a month ago and it was exceptionally cold out.  They were initially hesitant to leave the house given the temperatures, but once we got to Graze and were seated at our cozy corner table, they were very pleased.  The burgers as always were perfectly cooked and very flavorful.  Our waiter was excellent.  I joined the party 45 minutes late and he was great about still letting me order food and drinks despite the fact that everyone else was finishing eating and it would tie up the table for an extra half hour.  

It's now our go-to restaurant whenever we have company in town or just want to go out for a nice evening."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had dinner here we were in Madison the other nigh. My friend had recommended Graze, so I was excited to try it! There was a 30 min wait, but we were able to walk around the square until they texted us. It was an accurate estimate. Graze is really nice inside. The tall ceilings and floor to ceiling windows allow so much natural light in. I bet it's so cool inside (or maybe scaring) when it's pouring rain out. 

To drink, I had the special, white sangria, which I didn't love... too much orange. My boyfriend had two of their beers, which were great! We shared the Graze burger and the macaroni and cheese. Both were delicious. The Graze burger was so savory and perfectly cooked, we ordered it medium. The burger was flavorful and the grilled onions were a nice touch. The macaroni and cheese was pretty good, but fell short of expectations (maybe my expectations were too high, having cheese for the first time in Wisconsin). The pasta shells were nicely cooked and the cheese was interesting. There may have been some lemon or lemon rind/zest because it had a slight citrus flavor. The bread crumbs were nice. I like my mac and cheese and little more baked and the cheese not as runny. Overall, I'd go to Graze again if I'm back in town and would recommend it to others. Nice ambience, good beer list, and yummy burgers!"}
{"text":"I was in Madison for 3 nights, and tried this place my first night -- and I'm glad I did.  I ended up coming back again my last night.  The cheese curds were outstanding. They were perfectly prepared with excellent cheese, with a good dipping sauce.  For my main course, I ordered the Bibimbap, which I had actually never tried.  I ordered with with Tofu (I am not vegetarian by any means, but enjoy good tofu from time to time) because it sounded interested, and it was excellent.  Large portion.  The cocktails were good, as well.  My service at the bar was were friendly and attentive both visits.

My second visit, I just ordered a couple happy hour beers, and got attentive service again, and a great deal.  I plan to visit again next time I'm in town"}
{"text":"Graze was recommended to my boyfriend and I by a local Madison resident. I really love farm to table restaurants and knew we had to go here.

I love the inside of this place. It is in an all glass building, so it's so bright and airy. It has a modern feel. It can get loud, but doesn't feel overwhelming.

We ordered the deviled eggs and pork buns as our appetizer. I did not try the deviled eggs, but my boyfriend loved them. They were served with a smoked paprika aoli. The pork buns were delicious. They had a spicy sauce and were served with pickled vegetables. So good!

As for our meal, I ordered the wedge and the mussels. My boyfriend ordered the pub burger. The wedge was unlike any I've had before. It was served with marinated shiitake mushrooms, carrots, blue cheese and a Ranch/French dressing. It was so good! I enjoyed eating a different kind of wedge than the traditional.

Our main entrees did not disappoint. My boyfriend said his burger was cooked perfectly and came with homemade fries. The mussels I ordered were awesome. They were served in a spicy chili white wine sauce. The portion size was enough for 2, as my boyfriend could not get enough of these! They were exceptional.

I loved Graze and recommend this to anyone looking for a vibrant restaurant with fresh local entrees."}
{"text":"Today was a good day! Spending time with my son became a culinary dining experience that ended in magnificence. 
GRAZE is 5 star worthy. 
Upon the opening of the Giant glass doors, and entering the high ceiling area, you are greeting with a welcoming smile filled with sincerity. 
We were asked if we wanted a booth, a bit cozier choice if needed, or near the front of the house . which is along the huge floor to ceiling windows overlooking the square. We offered no opinion , and were given the seating with a view. Loved it! 
The server Anne, (who was impeccable) was so gracious timewise. This would hold true throught our entire visit. 
We ordered mid afternoon libations, then decided on our lunch choices.
The Moules Frites was a must. The Gorgeous Plump Mussels werre presented in a deep bowl, nice and hot, with the most delicate unevasive sauce worthy of dipping the hot crusty baguette into over and over. (that \"bread\" was insanely good)
The accompanying crisped Frites, which btw are NOT greasy at all, are served with a Saffron Aioli that is so wonderfuly balanced. (kethcup would be a crime)
My son had chosen for his luncheon entree, the Salad Lyonnaise. This included a perfectly poached Duck Egg  and also the Lardon made their already impeccable Dijon dressing,(and I quote)  \"a man's salad\". 
I  marveled in the Beet Salad, which consisted of golden and red warm beets, cut into appropriate size. with your toasted pepitas (pumpkin seeds)  along with a honey vinagarette dressing tossed so light over mixed greens.The star of the salad was the warm mound of creamy pepita crusted Goat Cheese that melted in your mouth and complimented the earthy beets perfectly
Our server Anne had such perceptively timed attentiveness  through our visit and i do feel the need to stress that and thank her. She made us feel welcome and apprecitated. 
 We LOVED GRAZE, and are so thrilled we made the correct city lunch choice.  Please do go. Indulge yourself in satisfaction. You're worth it."}
{"text":"Ordered a half cheese curds and rainbow trout. Both are very tasty. My only complain was the service is very slow. I waited 40 min for the trout."}
{"text":"Poor job by the kitchen staff. I had the same scramble as one of the people I was with and got half the amount of food and one small bit of shitaki mushroom. I can't believe the server would feel ok bringing it out to the table. Very disappointed as I have heard nothing but great things."}
{"text":"Probably the best cheese curds in town. I like the menu, but it is pricey and more focused on appetizers/drinks than dinner. The beet burger, popcorn, and hickory nut pie are also delicious! Amazing view of the Capitol."}
{"text":"An amazing farm to table restaurant that  is extremely affordable. Food that comes from so close just tastes better, everything we had didn't disappoint. 

-Beet and Walnut Pub Burger with a side salad yummy wow. 

-roasted seasonal veggies, you can taste the freshness 

-bimtami or whatever was sooo good. Crispy rice. Get the spicy sauce on the side and add in yourself. 

-YOU MUST GET THE CHEESE CURDS. YOU WILL REGRET IT FOR LIFE IF YOU DONT."}
{"text":"Great location and yummy food. If my friends come to Madison, this is the first choice I will bring them to."}
{"text":"I love bringing visitors to Graze! The wall-to-wall glass windows create a stunning view regardless of where you are sitting. The vibe is open and trendy, so it's a popular pick for special occasion dinners or drinks before a night out.

The menu is full of fresh, locally-grown ingredients and the combinations are unique - where else in Madison can you find crawfish beignets, bibimbap, and fried chicken and waffle on the same (ever-evolving) menu?

To start off, inquire about the seasonal punch. I've never been disappointed with this beverage, even though it changes nearly every time I visit. Favorite appetizers include the cheese curds, soft pretzel, and fries (this pick is made by the heavenly garlic aioli).

For staple Graze dishes, try the Pub Burger, Graze Burger, or Moules Frites (mussels). The seasonally-inspired dishes often include a seafood option, tofu selection, and some type of gnocchi, garnished with vegetables and vinaigrettes.

You also can't go wrong with any of the dessert options - Cookies and Milk, root beer float, or affogado (house-made custard in hot espresso) to name just a few sweet options.

One thing to note: Graze does not take reservations, so plan to arrive early or at non-peak times for large groups. The staff are very accommodating and will take your number so you can walk around the Capitol/have a drink while you're waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Graze continues to up its game, and with its dedication to local farmer's market fresh ingredients they have become, finally, a destination dining location in Madison.

I've eaten cheese curds all over Dane County, and I'm very happy to report that these are by far the best I've ever had----and I'm a big fan of curd preparations at many other local restaurants.

The whitefish cake lunch special is one of the best meals in Madison. Vegetarian burgers are good and a nice option for those with diet restrictions. \"Regular\" burgers on english muffins are tiny and not great, maybe a B-. How did they mess that one up and why hasn't preparation improved yet?

Mussels are decent but a little on the small size for the price, and frankly not as fresh as other places in town. The fish fry is spectacular: enormous, fresh, delicate, greasy, everything one looks for with a fish fry. The accompanying tartar sauce is light and airy.

Brunch is great. Great eggs benedict, good pancakes, great bacon, and for my money their biscuits and gravy are the absolute single best dish in Madison brunch. Three enormous buttery biscuits swimming in wonderfully unhealthy gravy literally teeming with sausage for $8.

Also of note are their rotating alcoholic fruit punches and lemonades constructed with seasonal farmer's market fruit such as blueberries or plums.

Service is OK. Occasionally on the haughty side. The northwoods kids who get jobs here as hosts don't understand how to perform pretentious, so they often come across as just rude. Food runners do keep things on track, and the wait staff will drop by your table once before the check to make sure things came out correctly."}
{"text":"Great place! Loved it for years. 

Fantastic burger, very very good cheese curds, love the meat plate. When they have ramen it is fantastic. 

Amazing drink menu!

I got to see Bernie Sanders here, totally by random!

Occasionally they host amazing restaurant events, be sure to check them out. 

I warn again, avoid peak times if you want a table without to much wait, and you want prompt service and any semblance of quiet. If you must come during peak times, wait for your table next door at the L'toile bar with a cocktail and starter."}
{"text":"I had the Bibimbap for dinner and it was in a word - awesome.  The flavor and freshness was out of this world.  I don't know how they made the rice (I suspect maybe it was deep fried?) but it was super tasty.  Our waitress was perfect.  The appetizer of Pork Buns was also really good.  I will absolutely be dining at Graze again."}
{"text":"Recommended by some friends, I decided to come here for dinner & give it a try.

This place was busy. When showing up for dinner, be patient as there may be a wait time of at least 20-30 minutes.

Good news, you can wait at the bar and have some pregame cocktails.

The restaurant is spacious and hosts a high ceiling so, the noise level can be a little much. Also know that there is seating available outside.

The menu is an interesting mix of Korean & American food. What I did like was that there was Bi Bim Bap - yum! 

I ordered the Tofu bowl with the gochujang on the side.

Amazingly delicious. They did do something interesting, the rice is formed into small bricks and fried. It gives it a different texture to mimick dolsot bi bim bap.

Good times- good food - and great company, throw in a nice ambiance and your going to like this place.

Enjoy! :)"}
{"text":"Overall: Quality food and service for a great experience. Definitely worth it!

The good: Food is great, from the cheese curds to the salad to the main course. The service was friendly and attentive. Clean atmosphere and nice ambiance. 

The bad: I wasn't a fan of the bipimbop having fried rice cubes. Otherwise it was great. Kind of expensive for the entire meal. The food took awhile to come out. Restaurant was cold.

{"text":"I ended up having the $21 graze burger. Not good. I have a top ten us list and this would barely make it. Over cooked. Service was great food was so so"}
{"text":"We were told that we needed to come to this restaurant, not primarily for the food but for the view. We were not disappointed. The restaurant is enclosed by floor to ceiling glass windows, and beyond the windows are a pretty sweet view of the capital. Especially gorgeous during the evening. 

The first thing I noticed about this restaurant though, is that it gets loud. I'm talking, \"I need a drink to tune everything else out\" kind of loud. Just a note. If you're a notorious over-orderer like I am, then try to snag a seat at a bar or a booth if possible, the tables in the center of the restaurant seem a little small.

As for the menu, there are a handful of market entrees you have all sorts of options including beef, fish, scallops, and tofu. The farm to table concept here is huge. The backside of the menu showcases all the local food supplies that Graze sources their food from. Eat local! There is also a small selection of other items to choose from which include traditional favorites like burgers, fried chicken and mac and cheese. Just for good measure, there's also a bibimbap on the menu--us rice loving Hawaii people appreciated this! 

While the Graze Burger seems to get all the hype around here, I wasn't in the mood to eat a full on cow so I decided to go with the Pub Burger and switched the regular beef patty with the beet and walnut patty. I'm no vegetarian (pls, I'm the girl who says a meal is not a meal if there's no meat in it), but I do love all beet everything and this was no exception. The flavor of the patty was certainly unique; it didn't replicate the flavor of a beef patty, but I don't think that was the intention here. I liked the subtle notes of sweetness from the beets, and the ground up walnuts did a good job in making the patty dense and moist. Using a toasty english muffin in lieu of a traditional burger bun was also very different, but I liked this change as well.

The cheese curds were delicious, deep fried goodness! I don't have much to compare it to, but it's hard to screw up cheese and fried stuff. Together with the house ranch, the curds are an artery clogging party--obviously the best kind.

Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area. Nice ambiance and great food!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Southern California and we usually stop and eat at Graze during our trips. We enjoy the food, the atmosphere and drinks. Lovely view of the capital building from the dinning room. Staff are friendly. This trip we had the double smash burger with greens. My greens were very salty and overdressed. It was okay but not optimal. The double smash burger was a good cheeseburger but something that can be had at any burger joint. Will always return for the atmosphere and good food and drinks."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place since I moved to Madison 8 months ago and I am SO glad they did not disappoint.

Didn't expect a Monday night to have a 30 minute wait but the hostess was kind enough to update us on seating availabilities in case we changed our minds about sitting in a booth. 

Anyway, it was a busy night--bar and tables were full. Looking around, people seemed to really enjoy their food. We sure did!

Fried pickles was easily the favorite of the night. The portion they provide is not enough to satisfy the hunger of two people who like pickles. The dill ranch was so yummy we coated our pickles in it. Again, not enough dill ranch. We want MORE!

Boyfriend had the pub burger, which he liked but felt he should've ordered something else, like the grilled sausage bun he was initially eyeing. He didn't feel it was something out of this world. I took a bite of it and I agree, but I did steal some fries off his plate since they were pretty good.

The bibimbap I ordered (which I'd been craving for weeks!) was a perfect mix of the pork, vegetables, and the gochujang. It was spicy but tolerable. The egg was completely coated in the sauce that I didn't realize the egg was there. Boyfriend enjoyed the crispy rice and it was the first time he had it that way. Perfect crisp on the outside and I didn't feel like it was ripping apart the inside of my mouth. 

Definitely will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Must see for anyone in the madison area!! Farm to table local ingredients make every dish special. Brunch is superb!"}
{"text":"We like going at different times of the year, since the menu changes so often. However, the bibimbap is an incredible go-to every time. Good cocktails as well, and when they have the blinds pulled you can get an above average view of the capitol and square."}
{"text":"Only good things to say.

I went to lunch at Graze today.  I received really nice service unlike what I have read in some other reviews.  My server came by and refilled my water at least three times and offered my date another soda once.

We asked for recommendations on the lunch menu.  She suggested the beet and walnut burger, the perch sandwich, as well as the ramen noodle bowl.  We went with her recommendations: beet and walnut burger with the mixed greens and the perch sandwich with fries.  I also had a cup of the soup d'jour - sunchoke with creme.  Everything was sooooo delicious (and I'm not a beet fan), although the sandwiches were a bit messy.

People have also commented on the prices.  For what I listed above... our bill was $30.  For quality service, food, and ambiance - sign me up!  

I definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I just celebrated 7 years of marriage yesterday.  My how time flies by.  When we met we were crazy college kids, now we are out in the world becoming professionals. A business man and a social worker, some would call it two worlds colliding but we share the roots of the same tree.

And that's what it's about. 

When we married we were so broke.  We had a small wedding, no crazy bling to flash in other women's faces, we kept it simple.  I was never the girl who dreamed of my wedding day.  For a few years we really struggled.  

I look back on those memories with such fondness.  

Seven years later flash to a restaurant table at Graze, us in our early thirties, A Malaysian guy and a White girl sharing warm jalapeno cheddar bread with garlic butter, hubby asking me what a Mojito tastes like - and chuckling at ourselves.  

Graze offered up a casual, comfortable way to begin lucky 7.  I had the pub burger with fries, hubby the grilled steak - both were fabulous.  We even got to sit near the chef himself, Tory Miller, and some of his loved ones who were eating there.

I first learned about Graze on Wisconsin Foodie.  It lived up to the expectation."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here yesterday. My lunch partner and I both ordered the Catfish sandwich with a grilled pineapple-chili relish. Server informed us it was rather large sandwich. mmmmm! Sounded Tasty!!  I upgraded to a side of potato leek soup.  The sandwich arrived, HUGE bun(est. 7 inches and quite wide), needed to be cut in half. Very tasty bun! However, inside was no more than 1/2 cup of a chopped catfish/pineapple relish mush plopped right in the middle of this huge bun. This for $14! Oh, well, $16 because I upgraded the side from selection of fries or salad to soup. The catfish mush was quite tasty. However, It only filled around 35% of the  bun, and was quite the thin spread of filling. Horrible Value! I cannot believe they can serve this \"All Bun\" plate as an acceptable lunch offering. My lunch partner agreed. And the soup? Someone in the kitchen whipped the potatoes wayyy too long. It was a Very gluey potato slime in a bowl. But Tasty!! :-)  The servers were quite professional and very nice. I was offered a different menu item and i was not charged for this catastrophe(blatant Rip Off) of a sandwich. But I am left confused by the fact that this respected establishment could serve such a lacking/crappy sandwich to a paying customer with a straight face. Kitchen gets an \"F\" grade on this one."}
{"text":"I have been to this place for dinner and the thing that really stands out in addition to a great menu was its service.  Everyone on the line ranging from the hostess to our server made the experiences worthwhile."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice on recommendations from just about everyone but it just doesn't do it for me. The roasted beet salad was great but it had way too much of the Hook's cheddar, which over powered a lot of the other really powerful ingredients in the salad (like I said too much!). My salmon came somewhat undercooked and it took way too long for me to flag someone down to get it remedied (I exclusively sit at bars to dine) so I just ate it undercooked. For a $30 plate that kind of really sucks.........."}
{"text":"We were in Madison for a night and wanted to find a place near the capital to eat and came upon Graze. It was a cold Monday night but the place was packed. We had an amazing view of the capital all lit up. 

For starters we got the fresh bread basket and a small order of cheese curds. The bread was good, especially the french bread. The cheese curds were excellent, not greasy. For the main course we ordered the chicken and waffles and the beef pub burger. The chicken and waffles were very good. The pub burger was OK. The bun for the burger was an english muffin which was a bit strange. Because of this the burger didn't taste as juicy as it should have. It would have been better on most any other type of bun."}
{"text":"This place is what a restaurant should strive to be.  I wish it was in placed in Chicago because I would go there every week!  Yes.. I would allow this place to drain me of all my funds and savings so I can savor their seasonal delicacies that is inspired by Mother Nature's bounty.

Last time I was here, I had my favorite fusion caprese salad.  It was fried Zucchini Blossoms topped on a bed of Wisconsin Fresh Mozzarella and Wisconsin Heirloom tomatoes, with a generous drizzle of Korean Gochujang aoili.  Don't know what Gochujang is?  Google it.  

This time, I couldn't resist and went with a healthy 3 course menu.  As my starter, I had their grilled asparagus with Muenster Cheese Curds.  mmmmm.... it was decorated with shavings of fresh asparagus!  The contrast in the vegetables was amazing!  Same vegetable... with 2 totally different taste!  \

Entree:  Vietnamese Sausage with Coconut Rice and Homemade Daikon Vegetables.  It tasted like a deconstructed bahn mi with a side of coconut rice.  I wonder what it would taste like in a bahn mi sandwich?  Chef.. could you make this happen one day?  :)  Maybe let me know too if you make this happen so I can drive up from Chicago.

Dessert:  Grasshopper sundae with Italian Merengue.  I almost wished I had a 2nd stomach so I can fit this whole sundae in my already stuffed belly.  Words can't describe the warm and creamy, heavenly delight.  Look at the pictures.  

Go soon because what I just described might not be there next week."}
{"text":"Clean, bright, casual, sophisticated.

Graze offers a great view of The Capitol.  It features local farmers and pays close attention to detail.

The food was excellent.  Beautifully presented and approachable.  

I got the Trout - and the only complaint I'll give is that it almost was too flavorful!  You know what I mean?  I think there's a fine line between being bland and overly seasoned.  And well - there was just a lot of flavor goin' on!

The have a thoughtful beer/wine list featuring local brewers and wineries alike and a creative cocktail list.

I would love to come back here for brunch - or even for a romantic dinner.  

So glad to have found Graze!"}
{"text":"Great high end local food for a reasonable price!

I'd like to comment on the commitment Graze makes to sustainable local produce.  They use a very high percentage of locally procured food.  

Atmosphere: Sleek and slightly trendy, fits right between a bar and a more formal restaurant... which I love!

Service:  The service has always been great the number of times I've been there.  Bartenders are also knowledgeable.  The one thing I could say is that they seem to be understaffed relatively frequently, as I've had to wait too long to get a drink a few times at the bar... a minor gripe. 

Food: Absolutely great.  Some of the best food I've had in the $10-20 price range in Madison.  The menu changes with the availability of local items, which keeps it interesting no matter how many times you've been there.  The place is a true value.

Bar: They have a variety of local and national microbrews that rotate.  They also have a good selection of wine and even have a selection of mead.  I ordered a flight of it the last time I was there, interesting to say the least!  They are also one of the few bars to bar tend properly and with attention to detail.  By properly I mean that they use correct size measuring devices and don't scam you by using a smaller one.  They also take the time to use fresh ingredients whenever possible, like garnishes, etc.  The also have a number of interesting twists to classic mixed drinks.

Overall, great place for a great meal, drinks, atmosphere for around $20 a person"}
{"text":"I was in Madison for work and a friend suggested Graze for dinner.  After a long day of travel and nonstop work, I headed to Graze tired and a little spacey.  I sat at the bar, which was a great idea.  The bartenders were friendly and I ended up sitting next to a very nice guy--a meal that I thought would be fast and impersonal ended up being super pleasant.  

I had a few glasses of wine and ordered the more expensive graze burger.  Holy sh*t.  That was a tasty burger.  Juicy, perfectly cooked, oniony, amazing.  GO NOW AND EAT THAT BURGER.  I want one right now.  

The view from the bar also can't be beat.  What a lovely little place.  I hope to go back someday!"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad meal at this place, ever. They cater to vegetarians and carnivores alike, and they switch up their menus every so often. I personally love their fresh warm pretzels and beet burgers, while my boyfriend has deemed Graze \"the BEST burger in all of Madison\". It is a little on the pricier side, but with a great view of the Capitol and food to die for, it's worth a little more. Side note- do give their weird sounding homemade lemonades a try, last time I went they had some cranberry concoction that was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Love how they use local ingredients.

Was a little disappointed in the House Pickles. Was somewhat mild in flavors more so in the kimchee. The Pork buns were mouth watering. Soft bun, crisp/juicy meat and condiments made it come together. The mac and cheese my look small but it is filling. The Bibimbap was excellent with the crisp rice, spicy gochujang and you can't go wrong with a sunny side egg on top."}
{"text":"So far, the best casual dining experience in Madison. I loved the sustainable, locally obtained ingredients and creative reimaginings of traditional favorites. When you can make a meal out a pub pretzel, you know you have struck gold."}
{"text":"Beautiful space with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the Capitol and outdoor seating. Extensive beer and drink list. We stopped in for lunch and were not disappointed. Get the cheese curds OBVI. Beet burger was fine but the simple greens salad was actually really special! Fun atmosphere for groups or dates."}
{"text":"Best cheese curds and soft pretzels around. Pub burger is my go to. English muffin burger that is just the right size and taste. Local drafts and cheeses really make this place stand out. The view is better than any other in Madison."}
{"text":"Debated whether or not to try this place while in Madison on business...  Met some new friends the night before and they suggested I go to Graze for breakfast.

First of all, it is beautiful & has wonderful views of the capital!  The interiors are beautiful!  Wooden floors & high, painted ceilings! 

I went in and was confused on how they handled breakfast patrons.  So, I went to the bar & they said they would take my order.  I ordered a diet coke (although their bloody mary's looked amazing!) and a breakfast croissant.  I hung around, waiting to see if I needed to pay then & there.  They took my payment & then a few minutes later, they told me to take a seat & they would deliver.  So, I took my coke & sat down.  The coke was very flat & asked for a replacement.  They didn't replace it until after I paid & was ready to leave.  I asked if I could get it to go.  They game me a new one in a small cup, which was disappointing.  I didn't go for the coke, but service is important.  My sandwich was amazing- Wisconsin cheddar makes everythng taste better.

Befor my departure, I tried to use the rest room.  Granted, it was about 8:30 in the morning & they were discusting.  I went to the one on the main level then needed to try the upstairs rest rooms because it was so dirty.  First stall was horrible, so settled on second.  Cleanliness of facilities is very important to me.

No doubt in my mind that everything on the menu is amazing- you can just tell.  It was just obvious that when I was there, other priorities were more important.

I would return."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Valentine's Day and Graze exceeded my expectations. The couples meal, a taco bar thing, was a whopping $125 without drinks, so we passed on that and ordered off the regular menu.

I ordered the pork tenderloin, which was presented nicely and tasted absolutely delicious. The house red wine was pretty good as well.

I had made a reservation a month in advance, so we were seated right away near the front windows with a prime view of the capitol building. Our server was very helpful and kind (I'm guessing they had the A-team out for Valentine's Day).

Can't say Graze is cheap, but you get what you pay for. I'd go there again for a special occasion."}
{"text":"graze puts on a great act of being an upscale representation of madison's food, but unfortunately the food is completely mediocre. if you want to grab wisconsin food by the balls for prices that are impressive, go to the old fashioned because graze is all about their facade and honestly their food to anyone actually looking at it instead of looking at the friend's faces they brought there will know in an instant that its just...simply nothing special. can't fight it when its staring you in the face."}
{"text":"The food and service was excellent. We had mussels and Bibimbap plus cheese curds. And let's not forget dessert."}
{"text":"Beautiful location, very attentive staff. We got the cheese curds and pickle board to start. Cheese curds, as everyone else has said, were amazing. We got a half order for two people and it was more than enough. The pickle board left a lot to be desired. It was a random pairing of selections and out of the six samples, we only enjoyed 3. 

For our meal, we split the mole frites and the bibimbap. Both were extremely tasty but relatively spicy. 

Drinks were good - we had the special lemonade and a Bloody Mary. 

Definitely a must in Madison. Make sure you go early to avoid a wait. Anytime before 6:30, you should be good."}
{"text":"Still dreamin about that Graze burger. Dan scoffed at the price, but pffft it was worth it and I hogged it all. My precious. I love this place for the view, too. Can't go wrong with those cheesecurds and pork buns either."}
{"text":"I am not from Madison but I travel here pretty frequently and have absolutely loved all the restaurants to date... Until I came to graze. Mind you, I'm a clean eater; I love clean, home grown food - which graze offers. There were three of us that went to brunch today and all of our entrees were HORRIBLE :( First off when we got there the host gave us our water and said a server would be by soon. 15 minutes later and no one came by so we asked the host about it and they actually comped us our app for the wait. Awesome, but that's where the greatness ends.. The burrito and burgers were so terrible; we ended up eating a few bites, paid, left and ate somewhere else. 

We will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"Had brunch with friends and we all liked our meals.  Waitress was friendly and attentive.  While the restaurant is beautiful and casual, it somehow lacks warmth (hard seats, high ceilings, few soft lines) which didn't make me want to linger and order a dessert or anything extra."}
{"text":"Saturday night I was there with three friends. It was fabulous. I've dined there a number of times and have always had an exceptional experience. The ambiance is a wonderful combination of Madison, big city and très chic local dining spot. The food is delicious, fresh, well prepared and imaginative without being over the top. The frosting on the cake is the outstanding service. Taylor, our server was very knowledgeable, friendly, relates well to her clients well, professional, confident without being cocky and efficient. She significantly enhanced the experience without over shading it. I look forward to another experience here again, soon."}
{"text":"First time at Graze.  The atmosphere is cute.  We sat outside and I ordered a Ginger snap which was really good.  We ordered their fries and it was really good.  I ordered a side of the mac and cheese with pork.  OMG, it was really good and rich with cheese.  I enjoyed it!  The service was kind of slow as they had a big table of 20.  Our waitress apologized for the long wait and also gave us a discount on our bill.  I will come back here again  when I am in town!"}
{"text":"Graze was amazing. The cheese curds are the best I've had in Wisconsin (so far). The rillette was excellent. The burger was good. It was lovely sitting outside. The service was great."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with family.  Great view of the capital.  Friendly and attentive staff working in modern architectural space.  Had the pub burger with fries done perfectly. Wife had Beet salad which was fresh and flavorful.  Would've five starred but they ran out of begnets."}
{"text":"Another place where 0 stars would be appropriate. Came in at about 12:30 with a medium  size group (8 people maybe?). We placed the other, it took them more than 25 min to bring it out (and that would be fine). A few of us got the eggplant sandwich, which turns out is pre-made (seriously? the food carts out there manage to make sandwiches on the spot!). The bread was so soggy I had to leave it (which for anyone who knows me, this is very rare). The fries were cold and greasy. I would have gotten better food at a gas station (and I would have not paid 12 bucks for it). Horrible, horrible. And the tip was included in the bill, so I could not even express my dissatisfaction."}
{"text":"Ok, ok.  It is local.  It is homemade.  I get it. 

Now the food itself?  It is just ordinary.  It is tasty and good but it is not worth the hype or the wait.  The restaurant does not take reservations.  As a first time diner, it would have been nice to know we could have left our name, ran an errand, received a text and then made our way back.  Instead we had to sit in the drafty entry way.  I was cold for forty minutes waiting for dinner.  

We got seated in a great booth.  It was just my husband and I.  I felt guilty because larger parties got passed up.  Nonetheless, it was cozy and very comfortable.  We decided to try the Fried Gnudi.  This is essentially a fancy cheese curd.  It was delicious.  It tastes like a bread stick without bread.  It would have been nice to know what they were.  Instead, we were told they were ricotta like gnocchi.  As a gnocchi eater, I can assure you they were nothing like gnocchi.  

Now dinner.  I tried the Mac and Cheese.  I was a bit disappointed.  I do not like strong cheddar.  I asked the waitress whether the cheese had a strong flavor.  Her response?  No, the aged cheddar was a smoky taste that comes out when the cheese is cooked.  I took a chance.  It was beautifully served.  It is a very rich meal.  It is very cheesy and creamy.  However, the cheese taste itself?  It was incredibly strong.  I was not happy with it.  I was told the completely wrong thing.  The portion is also small for $9.  I was kind of upset by this.  

We also ordered the pub burger.  We shared each other these meals.  The burger was cooked well but it was a small patty.  It was served on an English muffin.  I am assuming it was homemade.  It was so dense and lacked any type of lightness I have had with other English muffins.  

The star of the meal?  The fries with garlic aoli.  Hands down.  Magnificent.  

The food was not terrible.  It was good, average food.  The service was good.  The people were nice.  Graze is just not worth all the hype.  Nope."}
{"text":"I think this is the perfect dinner place for Madison: [local, sustainable] meat -heavy menu, ample portions, but a elegant and modern sophistication in presentation of the food and the ambiance.

The Bahn Mi Sandwich was rich with good textures in the pate and meat and fresh tasting veggies (except that it was the main source of inspiration for the nightmare I had about the chicken liver pate in a severed dog's head....but i digress). 

Good for a date or to come with friends.

All in all I spent under $20 (including tip and a local microbrew).  So, I am definitely going to come back and try one of their other delicious dishes in a couple of weeks!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided to do lunch here after dropping off coworkers at the airport.  We decided to spend the rest of the day walking around Madison.  We got ate around 1 which seemed to be a perfect time- the lunch rush was over!  Our waiter was excellent and very helpful as far as the menu was concerned.  My friend had the blue moon beef which is only available in Wisc- she loved it and wanted to take a case home.  We both ordered the Korean BBQ sandwich.  Heaven in my mouth! It was the perfect balance between spicy and sweet.  Our waiter enticed is with the bourbon pecan pie- again a hit!  Very rich and sweet so it's good we ended up sharing 1 portion!  Now that we've had a taste of Graze... We want more! Next Epic trip will include dinner at Graze.  Btw all their food is locally sourced and tastes like it too!"}
{"text":"I really want to love graze but it never quite lives up to my expectations. The space itself is really beautiful and I love the how open it is and the windows, however all that space means it can get very noisy.  I also like that they serve fresh local, seasonal food so I got the gnocchi which came with squash, apples, kale and a cider sauce which seemed perfect for fall. The texture of the gnocchi was great- nice and light, however the rest of the dish was just too sweet (and this is coming from someone who loves sweets).  Also even with an order of cheese curds and a soft pretzel as appetizers (split with my group) I was left hungry at the end of the meal. Combine this with some pretty slow service and I just can't justify giving them more than three stars."}
{"text":"Amazing. Great vegetarian options.  Love the Mac and Cheese with Hooks 10 year cheddar. The Bibimbop is also very good."}
{"text":"I was feeling indecisive amongst my Madison bookmarks and proferred the wife to make a selection amongst my selections. I hardly had to spit out the word Graze and its connotations before she made that her choice. I didn't complain; a bit of homework led me to understand that Graze is run by a Bearded chef. That's Beard, as in James Beard. Shaken, not stirred.

Graze sits a modest, modernist glass case of emotion directly across from the Capitol. It's connected to its sister restaurant, the starry-eyed named L'Etoile. The view from either is quite spectacular.

Of course, a place that calls itself Graze screams farm to table, though exactly what farms are left unclear by the menu. The menu, like the chef-owner, has a Korean slant to it, with Wisconsin farm overtones. It also has a $21 burger purported to be one of the best in America.

It is perhaps unfair that I had just eaten the best burger in Chicago, the meticulously simple concoction at Au Cheval. So, and especially for a Jackson plus Washington, there was barely a chance for Graze's burger to equate. Graze's burger is good, and there are parts that are great--the tangy caramelized onions, the delicious on-the-side aioli, and the wonderful fried egg I stole from my wife's bibimbap bowl.

Here's where it falls short. The first is the at times delicious and at other times overtly sour-acidic patty. It's a combination of bacon, sirloin, ground beef, and short rib, and if you just drooled on your phone or computer screen a little, it's OK. That all sounds as mouth-watering as it should, but the patty was a little too big, didn't hold together well enough, and was splashed with just too much Worcestershire-cabernet jus, killing the proper taste of the meat. The second is the fact that the burger plain done fell apart, whether from too much jus, too much meat, or my daft idea that a stolen fried egg would be the cherry on top. Burgers. Shouldn't. Fall. Apart. Period. (And if they do, as in they are meant to, you had better dang well wrap the sucker in white paper first.)

Extremely high expectations for the burger aside, the meal went really well. The cheese curds, a delicacy we had to order, this being Wisconsin and all, were fantastic. Special kudos to the house ranch that tasted a mite like tartar sauce, a plus for me. The pickle board was also a great deal of fun, with six different pickled plates ranging from kimchi to beets in a citrus vinaigrette. Yes, kimchi--remember the Korean thing. 

As we hadn't had Korean food during our duration in Chicago, now approaching eight months, the wife narrowed in on the bibimbap bowl. The gochujang and its spiciness set her back a bit, but the bowl was chock full of fresh, delicious vegetables and marvelous blocks of crispy fried rice. Even at its price point, the bibimbap was tasty and impressive.

Too full for dessert, I'll call the night here. Graze is a great space with charming, inviting decor and a solid wait staff. If the burger had been mindblowingly good and worth the price tag, this would be a five-star review. But like I said, it was a high bar to reach, and a fantastic meal nonetheless."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must visit in Madison, WI.  The food and ambiance are exceptional.  Went here for brunch/lunch several times while visiting our daughter at the University of Wisconsin.  We will plan to visit here often in the future.  It is located directly across from the Capitol with a beautiful view through it's wall to ceiling picturesque windows.  Their choice of cheese platters is extensive and worth trying.  The staff is also very knowledgeable about the choice of selections to make.  This restaurant will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"It's saturday and the place isnt even half way full. We ordered the pickle board, bibimbap, and 2 burgers. 
Took about 30minutes for our pickle board to show. Why? All of it was premade. Literally waited another 30min for our main dish. After i asked the host to ask our waiter to check on our food (our waiter disappeared for that last long stretch) the HoST not the waiter comes back to tell us- brace yourself- your ticket is up next they just had to have \"a conversation about the white cheese\". Back story, my dads friend asked for white cheese on his burger. But a conversation? Like a 45min conversation? Talk about reaching. No excuse for them to take so long to bring our appetizer and our main dishes. I was super pissed. 
Was the food good? Yes but not worth the wait. Plenty of other good restaurants within walking distance.

Oh yeah i found a black hair on my fried rice but was so hungry i just picked out that portion and kept sholving food in my mouth.  Fyi my hair is blonde."}
{"text":"Great space directly across from the State Capitol. Great vibe and decor.  If I worked nearby, I'd want to hang out here after work.

Enjoyed six of the many cheeses they offer for their cheese plate, but the cheese plate was not as good as the one at Eno Vino in Middleton.  Graze cheese plate comes with a sweet blueberry jam which I didn't think was an ideal fit for the sharp cheese they offer.  I feel that sharp cheese requires a stronger flavor such as apricot jam or honey. Cheese plates in other restaurants often include grapes, apples, pears, olives and/or nuts. Graze's cheese plate seems skimpy and boring in comparison."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Madison and it's always at the top of my list when I'm making recommendations to out-of-towers (& locals)!  There's nothing NOT good about it - the food is delish, the cocktails are fun and the view,
I mean come on!   I feel like I've tried a bit of everything on the menu from their take of the Korean fave Bibimbap to their roasted bone marrow.  Of course, get the cheese curds for a quintessential taste of Wisconsin or start with the delectable pork buns, so pillowy!  If you're looking to go big, double down on the Graze burger, made of short ribs & sirloin, bacon, caramelized onions, etc etc.  so freaking good, worth every penny of the $21 price tag!

Go to Graze for a special evening out or just a fun lunch with friends.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Brunch with a view of the farmers market and the capital. Very nice stuff. The fresh berries on my pancakes had come from said market just moments before. Real maple of course (but a bit light in syrup size serving -- not a good year for syrup though I'm afraid). And the spicy compound butter was a real treat. Get there early on market day!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best food and service I've had in years. Seanna was very knowledgable and selected some fabulous cheeses for our cheese plate. The cheesecake was really special. You could happily turn obese at this place. Ok the hook!"}
{"text":"Graze is a diamond in a sea of cheesy, fried spongy roughness. With fresh everything, locally sourced, and well cooked, I couldn't have asked for more. 

It is a snazzy place and expensive compared to the rest of Madison, yet very affordable for any other major city I've been in. There is often a wait, unless you are willing o sit at re bar. I ate here 4 times in just 13 non consecutive days, it was spectacular. 

You MUST start with the Parmesan truffle popcorn - it is SO good. It seems like the rest of the menu is very seasonal, and changes often. I had a tomato stack in the summer, seasonal veggies in the early fall. Everything was cooked well and did not feel too heavy. 

I was disappointed by the pretzel, especially compared to other local places, but the Mac and cheese I had more than made up for it. Even the beet burger was good! I am realizing I might like beers when well done.

Ask for the vegetarian menu if you don't want to be lead wrong. Desserts are not too sweet, so I liked them. The salted cookies and ice cream were great and fresh! I miss graze often and though I never want to move to Madison, I sure do like visiting because of Graze!"}
{"text":"I love farm to table.  I love Madison.   So why on earth could I give a farm to table restaurant in Madison a 2 star rating?  Biggest reason: When you list twenty different providers of produce to your restaurant, you should be able to come up with at least one way to prepare said veggies without meat that is more creative than \"Mac and cheese\".  This is true even if you are in Wisconsin.   There are other reasons, but that is what dropped it from 3 or 4 stars to two.  Service was great, choices were unfortunate."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, delicious food, and super yummy craft cocktails! Stopped here for entrees during a progressive dinner. The place was packed. Neat text message system letting you know your table is ready. No gross, filthy pager system. The hostess was a little frazzled as the other customers around us were incredibly rude. The bar service was a little slow but was wonderful once we got someone's attention. Our actual server was wonderful. Very personable and offered wonderful suggestions. My friend had the pork chops...huge portion! I had the gnocchi and it was absolutely delicious. It was light and just the right amount of food. I would definitely recommend this establishment to a friend!"}
{"text":"Everything tastes perfect here. My only complaint is the acoustics, it gets pretty loud. I still love Graze and everything that goes with it."}
{"text":"Eclectic menu, great view, friendly service, and accommodating; what a great find! 

The fried cheese curds are amazing as everybody says they are. The burgers tasted great! I had the pork buns which had amazing flavor and texture!

Our server was pleasant and the entire staff was welcoming. Everyone seemed to be helping one another! We felt special and taken care of, which allowed us to focus on our conversations and enjoy ourselves!

A must stop!"}
{"text":"Nice vegetarian options although I wish they had more. Their bibimbap burrito is outstanding and I wish it wasn't just served at brunch. The only thing I didn't love was that due to the large windows, heat regulation seems to be a big issue and it tends to get crazy hot when the sun is piercing through the windows"}
{"text":"This place is right downtown Madison but has easy parking and amazing food! I came for a quick lunch while traveling for business and loved their commitment to local foods and farmers. I had the kimchi pork sandwich with the side of greens and it was perfect! This also looks like a fun place for an evening cocktail. 

My only disappointment was the limited menu. Although there may be more options for dinner, I felt there weren't as many options for lunch as I'd like."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on our roadtrip and I'm so glad we stopped. First of all, its totally our kind of place - locally sourced foods, (they have a map of WI when you walk in with pins in each place their food comes from), lots of unique flavor combinations, and just good ingredients. We started with the fried pickles (had to) - lightly battered crunchy spears of goodness. Then CB had the burger with cheese curds. It was our first time partaking in the cheese curds, and it was so worth the calories. The batter had vodka in it (I think?) which made it light and crisy, and the cheese was perfectly melty, but not so stringy you couldn't eat it. I had the walnut and beet veggie burger, which later someone said had been featured on the Food Network at some point. If that's true, I can see why. It had a very meaty, dense texture, but a delicious, light flavor. I don't think I could describe how it actually tasted, so just take my word for it, and order it. The green salad that came with it was quite possibly one of the best salads I have ever had in my entire life. The dressing was fantastic. Sigh. Now I want one..."}
{"text":"If you watch Portlandia then you know what to expect here. It is casual upscale dining with a hipster feel. Nothing really stands out as amazing, but overall it is okay. 

We tried the cheese curds and Mac-n-Cheese with brisket. Cheese curds with Hook Cheese can't be bad, but the sauce wasn't as tasty as we'd hoped. The Mac-n-Cheese continues to be a let down in Madison, but I'd say this is the best of them. 

Service was good and attentive. Seemed to know the menu well. The kicker here is the cost. It's high enough to make it not a watering hole type location, but not dressy enough for a night out on the town. 

People locally love the place. I think it's a solid choice on the square."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times, they have a great menu that is local and organic, this morning I saw staff from Graze shopping at the farmer's market, love that.  I would recommend anything on the menu, for brunch I love the chilaquiles.  The only thing I don't like at Graze is their Bloody Mary, it is one of the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"I appreciate the need to be trendy and local, but this place is all talk and not enough show considering the Yummy factor for a guy like me....

I've had much better food for the price in many establishes around the Capital. 
I do strongly appreciate how much they are supporting the surrounding Madison Area food (for that a solid 3 out of 5 stars), but I was a bit let down with the production of what I have received in my orders. 

The menu is unique for sure, finding some really cool Madison area alternative eating's, but just be ready to expect that your ordering unique so what they will be bringing you might now be up your ally if your similar to a country boy like me who wants a big old bar burger (grease me up!) loaded up. 
It's hard to screw up a cheeseburger, and I think they may have totally messed it up pretty bad the last time I was there. I'm just not a fan of an English Muffin as a bun for a burger. 

They are a popular place that does not take reservations, so be prepared to wait to be seated. but if your lucky, you will get to sit in a huge booth or nice table, definitely, a great date place with huge place windows over looking Madison at it's finest. 

I'm not trying to be negative about Graze, I'm just not into it as much as everyone else. I would still suggest to try it out. It has enough window appeal to draw anyone it."}
{"text":"Good lunch with a view!! Been to Graze a dozen times or so and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Solid restaurant.  We were in town for a conference which happened to be at the same time the Cross fit games were going on. They had a special menu with focused on paleo diets.... which I did not partake in.

Great food and great atmosphere.  Nice open space and a great patio for nice days. We had to wait 20 minutes for a table at 11:45am on a Wednesday but given it's right downtown and several conferences going on along with all the cross fitters, I considered that normal."}
{"text":"I have been to graze three times now and each time the same hostess has ignored me and my party for at least fifteen minutes before even greeting us. The last time I went in over the late lunch hour, the hostesses did not great me at all while I waited to simply inquire about a wait time. I ended up walking away because of how rude they had been.

When I had actually eaten at graze, the bartenders were slow and flippant, with absolutely no urgency. The servers that I've had have been great however.   

The food was okay. Nothing spectacular, especially for the price. I ordered the special, chicken and waffles, thinking they would dress it up and present a really cool take on this dish. They served me a plate with a waffle and two pieces of fried chicken on top. It was a very unappealing presentation. The chicken was incredibly salty. Almost inedible. The rest of my party was less than impressed with their dishes as well. 

Would at least try graze again if it wasn't for the disrespectful hostesses. 

Will not be going back."}
{"text":"Went for lunch after a capitol tour. Everything was prepared with attention to detail. You can't go wrong here. Even the cheeseburger was grain fed and delicious. Special drinks were great."}
{"text":"The tables and chairs don't quite fit the decor, and its a bit noisy, but when you get right down to it the food is great.  Had some of the best cod of my life for the Friday night fish fry, a good cocktail, and a splendid raspberry chocolate cheesecake.  Our server Natalie was attentive and personable.  People-watching all the folks up on the capitol is an added benefit."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! A must if you're visiting Madison! Everything here is top of the line. I would recommend just about anything on the menu. The Graze burger is unlike and burger I've ever had, needless to say it is amazing. It is slightly expensive but totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Great view of the State Capitol and good food.  Non pretentious staff and eclectic crowd."}
{"text":"Graze has over time become my favorite restaurant in Madison. Not just for the delicious food, but for the exceptional service and ambiance. I started going to graze just for lunch/brunch but after a while I figured I  would try dinner. Their drink menu is superb, I love how they use fresh herbs and update it regularly. They also update their dinner menu a few times a year so it's fun to try what's new. I've never been disappointed after eating here. I appreciate their use of local ingredients and love that they support Wisconsin farmers. I highly recommend it!! (Oh, and best cheese curds in madison...yep I went there!)"}
{"text":"I continue to have high hopes for Graze but each time we eat there I'm left feeling underwhelmed...so much so that it'll be a while since we return. The menu doesn't change very often and the service has been sub-par the last two times we've dined there. The stand-out entree for me is the black pepper pasta which is very good but I need to see some menu changes soon if I'm to go back."}
{"text":"I could drink here everyday. Their cocktails are inventive and delicious. My trips to Madison are always focused on beer so this is a nice break from the pints. They have happy hour twice a day with 2-for-1 offerings. 

The Dr usually orders us a cheese board. Some of these cheeses we never see in Colorado. We have even asked for a board filled with every cheese on the menu. We like cheese. We have paired this with the pickle board, beet salad or shared a sammich. All the food is fast and fresh. We have done brunch here as well filling up on chicken fried steak or chicken & waffles that cured my hangover instantly. 

This place can get very busy. We have been lucky to always find space at the bar where you can get the full menu."}
{"text":"I absolutely love that Tori Miller is slowly moving mainstream diners to try / become familiar with Korean food.  The menu is an interesting fusion of American and Korean food, from sandwiches and salads to pho and a noodle bowl.  

We ordered warm winter drinks, which were excellent, and the pickle board to start.  Pickles (again, some Asian influences) were awesome.  Followed up with noodle bowl salad for myself and my husband had the Korean BBQ park (which he raved about).

Service was exceptional.  At one point we started counting all the different people that served us or refilled our water or cleared plates - probably 6 or 7.  And they float in and out without ever stepping on another's toes; I don't know have any idea how they coordinate all that.  

They source much of their ingredients locally, and the location is really fun on the square.  I don't have a single negative thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"BEST fried cheese curds I've ever had!

This place is absolutely fantastic.  So many options on the menu--vegan and veggie, too!  Their drinks are original and very tasty.

I love the Korean Bibimbop or the beet/walnut burger.

A little pricey, but totally worth it.  Any foodie should definitely try this place at least once!"}
{"text":"I have never paid so much money for such bad food. Corn was watery. Steak was tough, thin, and generally gross."}
{"text":"We started our meal off with the deviled eggs and the soft pretzel appetizer. The eggs were good, and the pretzel was delicious, although I wasn't a fan of most of the dips that came with it. I had the farmer johns provolone sandwich with ham. I loved the bread, and the sandwich was quite large and filling. The fries that came with it were also good. I came here for a business lunch, and I did not pay for it, so I can't really comment on the value. The staff were attentive and overall it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Graze is one of the most acclaimed restaurants in Madison, with very good reason. It's the less formal (and less expensive) sister restaurant of L'Etoile, which is right next door, and just steps from the Capitol. Graze (so named for the farming aspect as well as what the menu inspires guests to do) is less formal, but just as much creativity and attention to detail go into everything on the menu. It's the kind of place you'd go just for drinks or food, and stay for the other. During a recent thirty-six hour stay in Madison, we went twice; once for early-evening cocktails and snacks, the other for a mid-afternoon nosh. It was close to our hotel, but proximity aside, we went back because we just enjoyed it that much.

I can't say enough good things about the fantastic food and terrific cocktails. Over the course of two visits we were able to sample quite a bit of the menu and there wasn't anything we didn't love. On the evening visit we tried Sassy Cow cheese curds with a vodka batter; deviled eggs, house-made pickles (beets, cucumbers, escabeche, daikon, kimchee), truffled popcorn, frites with garlic aioli, and fresh oysters with just-grated horseradish. Everything was eminently enjoyable. My cocktail of choice was the 'Herb 'n Cruise,' a tasty concoction of New Amsterdam gin, Lillet, basil simple syrup and lemon. It was so smooth and drinkable. Later on I switched to a non-alcoholic seasonal lemonade and this week's flavor was blueberry-rhubarb. So fruity and refreshing!

On the second visit, they were still serving their brunch menu so we just shared a lox and bagel plate (and more of that delicious lemonade!) and that too was top-notch. The bagel was an \"everything,\" the cream cheese was flecked with bits of fresh lemon zest and dill, and the lox was in the shape of a rosette. On the side was a tiny dish of capers and red onion. It was a lovely presentation and tasted as good as it looked.

The servers here are some friendly folk and took great care of us on both visits. The menu changes seasonally and it goes without saying that all the ingredients are locally sourced.

Graze is now on our \"must-visit\" list for frequent trips to Madison."}
{"text":"Fantastic. 

Best cheese curds in town: Graze and Haritage. Bibimbap was fantastic. Burger was perfect. 

Keep in mind, the wait can be impossible (up to 2 hours for two!)"}
{"text":"So awesome. Family friendly, locally sourced, great cocktails. Bibimbap was fantastic."}
{"text":"Their cheese curds are my favorite in Madison. Ive come here a few times for brunch and tried a lot of their offerings, but the only thing that really has any wow factor to me are those cheese curds.

*update*

I just finished eating non brunch here for the first time. Im not a big burger fan, so i cant say much about it, but the mac and cheese was a masterpiece. Medium, al dente shells in a rich, thick, garlicky cheese sauce. It tastes like some seriously aged cheese!

*another update*

I just became the duke and realized that ive eaten here a lot of times (forgot to check in for some of those times). If i'm eating here so much, i must seriously love it, so im bumping this up to 5.

This time around, i just came back from a heavy day at the gym and was craving something with some meat, big flavor, and lots of fresh vegetables for my post workout meal. The bibimbap really delivered! I think it couldve used more rice to be more similar to what my korean grandma makes, but it was perfect for my veggie craving because it was packed with fresh cucumber, radish, and carrots. This was the perfect follow up to my protein shake."}
{"text":"One of my favorites in Madison. Excellent location with beautiful view of the capital building through the large glass windows. Good cocktails and great food for brunch, lunch, and dinner. It's farm to table style and everything's pretty good. Id recommend the bibembap."}
{"text":"Solid four stars and that's really because of one dish.  First off, the ambience is great, service is great, locations is great.  I've tried a few of their dishes and they were just better than most places.  However, there is one dish there that really blew my mind.  It was the pork belly buns.  These were like little asian tacos.  The outside was a doughy bun and it was filled with a nice slice of pork belly, kim chi, and hoisin sauce.  It is incredible.  It's really the main attraction for me.  

If you want a cool place to chill, this is definitely the place.  The food is slightly better but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Great Service. Great Food. And I was surprised that I enjoyed being in the actual restaurant; was dubious from the outside, it being all glass. Very comfortable. We had the Oyster selection from Washington State along with a mixed green salad perfectly dressed. The Solume plate of sured meats with home made mustard and warm (nice touch) olives. I had the eggs bennedict  with frothy hollandaise--perfect. Actually, I could've used some more hash browns. Its is just a potato after all. C'mon. Great brunch, we will return."}
{"text":"Loved the noodle bowl! The pork flavor was awesome and the soup seemed like it had been cooking well overnight. It was a large portion, and I ended up taking over half to-go. 

Our waitress was very attentive and left the water pitcher on the table for us to help ourselves in between her check-ins."}
{"text":"The cheese curds are awesome and the view of the capitol adds to the atmosphere. This is my favorite place to bring friends and family visiting Madison for the first time."}
{"text":"This place is overrated, just because it's tory miller doesn't make it better. Had the graze burger, neither the patty nor the English muffin(?) was good. The bibimbap is quite a joke too. The quality definitely doesn't live up to its price."}
{"text":"i had brunch there. it was so delicious!!! all of the meals we got were just as amazing, and everything is local so thats really cool."}
{"text":"Wine was good. Wine with the cheese we ordered was fantastic. I also had the Graze burger which was uniquely delicious. The whole thing was light and full of flavor. I've really never had a burger like it."}
{"text":"My wife and I moved to Madison about a month ago, and we were pumped to try Graze when we heard they have Nutella stuffed French toast on their brunch menu.

We finally visited with some friends from out of town. The wait was about 50 minutes long, which wasn't bad, considering that there was a 5k that morning nearby. Luckily Graze uses a waitlist app so we were able to monitor our place in the queue as we chatted and waited for a table.

We were overall impressed with the quality of service, and it is the main reason for the score. The food was pretty good too, especially the cheese curds!

I ended up ordering cheese curds and beignets for the table with a glass of fresh orange juice for myself. The beignets were a little dense for my liking. They were definitely not from New Orleans! For an entree I ordered the nutella stuffed French toast I had been looking forward to. My wife was wholly unimpressed by the French toast. For being a stuffed toast, it barely had an nutella inside, and the toast was overcooked.

I am unfortunately allergic to apples and ordered the stuffed french toast, which is topped with seasonal fruit. I didn't think to ask it had apples, oops! Of course, I was at fault here for not asking so we didn't make a fuss. I decided I would just get a snack later. The waiter voluntarily amended the situation when he saw the full plate and provided a substitute plate of pancakes, comping both meals. It felt great to be taken care of, despite being at fault myself!

The pancakes were a little over done, but overall I was just happy to have food.

I would return to Graze again for sure. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations so facing the crowd is inevitable."}
{"text":"Space is so open and light! I had a tough time deciding between Graze and The Old Fashioned for cheese curds, but I picked here because.. well, who wouldn't want to try Asian/Wisconsin fusion? I was happy that I didn't have to add a full $9 for my cheese curds, but bummed that it wasn't offered as an optional side for the entrée. But I settled for my half order costing $5 :)

The cheese curds were delicious!!! Bibimbap, ehh... I had to dig through the bowl looking for the \"bap\" part of the dish before realizing that it wasn't sitting as a bed on the bottom of everything. Kind of surprised that the rice was fried into little sticks, but I guess it keeps it cleaner that way."}
{"text":"The mac-n-cheese here with the pulled pork was honestly the best mac I've ever had. The infusion of flavors was unparalleled, and the service was excellent as well. Additionally, I loved that most of the ingredients were locally sourced. Great work."}
{"text":"Food is good with the emphasis on local.   Service was also good.  No kids menu or even particularly kid friendly food.  No reservations,  no call ahead seating.   The thing preventing me from rating it higher was this space is loud.  1:30 pm for Sunday Brunch this place was full, on a wait and I can't hear myself think loud.  By the time we left it was half empty (closing time), and the noise level was ok.  Perhaps plan your visit off peak."}
{"text":"So there no doubt about how good their food is... This time I would like to write about how exceptional and we'll prepared the staff are here at graze!! I accidentally ordered a dish that had some spicy sauce in it.. It was delicious but I am allergic to capsaicin (an active component of chili peppers) no one usually knows what it is... When I told our server that I'm allergic to spicy food, he immediately said your allergic to capsaicin took my dish and asked me if I wanted to order a different dish... I was beginning to itch and breakout when the supervisor came along and asked me if I was ok and if I need anything. He offered benadryl and stated if they don't have any they will have someone buy it... Or call 911 if my allergy is severe!! I took the benadryl and was able to enjoy the rest of my time there. I was totally amazed on how ready and prepared everyone was!! If I did have a severe allergic reaction these guys know what to do!!

To the owner of graze you have a fantastic staff!!!"}
{"text":"The menu is very pretentious. It seems like every entree is over the top extravagant. I ended up getting the Mac and cheese which was good, but really only for it because I didn't want anything else on the menu. My boyfriend got pork and didn't love it. From a guy who will eat and try just about anything he had a few bites and couldn't finish it.  The cheese plate was the best part of our meal and popcorn was good but nothing to rave about. I'd try it again for brunch but that's the only reason I'd go back."}
{"text":"Good food. I would place it behind the Old Fashioned or Harvest if I were ranking them... A little pricey and you may have to wait a bit for a seat. Regardless, you're in a cool spot on the square with great natural lighting!"}
{"text":"Did you know that they have 2 for 1 drinks happy hour? Because they do and it is grand. Their dinner options are also wonderful. Their mac n cheese tastes like it has about 16 different interesting and complementary cheeses in it. There are actually only four types, but they are delicious and fun to try to guess. The entire dinner menu is diverse and mouthwatering.

Their brunch, however, is very average. For the money, I would go elsewhere.

The service is also excellent."}
{"text":"We visited Graze for brunch on a Sunday, and the food was absolutely delicious. I went to this place based solely on the positive reviews, and the Yelpers were right! My husband had a burrito, and I had the kielbasa with eggs and hash browns. We were all members of the clean plate club that day. I think my favorite thing was the fancy french donuts (beignets). They were freshly made and so good I immediately wished we'd ordered two plates. 

The location is beautiful, and the restaurant is very cool inside. Our service was pretty good, too. We brought our young sons with us, and they loved the food as well. If I lived closer to this place, I'd want to visit all the time. This wasn't a cheap meal, but I felt like the quality of the meal was well worth the cost."}
{"text":"Graze is the cheaper sister establishment of L'Etoile, one of the fancier restaurants in the Capitol area. I came here for brunch. Graze, as the name might suggest, is yet another one of the farm-to-table restaurants that has been sweeping the nation as part of the organic/local/GM-free/anti-corporate food movement. And indeed, they do a good job embracing this idea. I have never really appreciated pork in the East Coast, but here in the Midwest the pork is delicious.

The order for my party was: Eggs Benedict with hash browns and greens; a bowl of noodles with roasted pork shoulder; and cheese curds to start. I've had cheese curds at other establishments, but Graze tries to separate itself from the crowd by using finer processes and ingredients in their cheese curds. Your mileage may vary here. Ditto with the Eggs Benedict. Now the noodle bowl was comparatively better. The pork shoulder was intensely tender and flavorful, and I could tell that the broth was made fresh instead of (gasp!) dissolved beef bouillon. The only thing holding back this establishment from a five-star rating is that compared to all the other restaurants in the area, it lacks distinction. Sure, the food is good, but there is also good food next door. Merely good garners four stars - to be a five-star restaurant, one must be special."}
{"text":"Pork buns are incredible! 
Graze burger is totally worth the wait!
Summer sangria is amazing!
Strawberry rubarb lemonade awesome!"}
{"text":"Graze for brunch is fantastic! Locally sourced premium quality ingredients well executed. Had Eggs Benedict which were perfect, great strong flavorful coffee. Service was good, atmosphere was open and sunny, a little loud but not overly. Go early to avoid a wait as they do not take reservations."}
{"text":"This place is really neat. There is something about this restaurant that is really welcoming and it makes me want to return.

Let me just put the cons out there. It's crowded in there. Tables are a little too close in some spots and there isn't a ton of space in the walkways, so you may bump into people who are eating while walking to your table. Also, we had a nice table upfront by the window, which would have been great if it weren't so chili! We asked twice before they adjusted the heat and stopped blowing cool air.

Now that that is out of the way, let me tell you about the good stuff! When we arrived, we were greeted by very nice staff. That continued on to our waiter and all of the other staff we encountered. All were friendly and knew a lot about the food being served.

I got the chicken and waffles with cayenne butter. Holy amazingness! The chicken had a tiny bit of heat to it and was fried to a crisp. There was a piece of dark and white meat that were really large portions! The waffle wasn't light and fluffy like most. It was a thinner waffle that was delicious. Add the syrup and butter for a perfectly sweet and salty dish with a little spice!

I forgot to mention, they use locally sourced ingredients so the food is just better than other places for that reason. Everything is fresh and supports the community!"}
{"text":"I love Graze and everything it stands for when it comes to farm to table. It is one of my favorite places to go and bring out-of-towners. The ambiance and setting with the capital in the background it awesome. The food is also amazing.

First off, great selection of mixed cocktails and beers on tap. Then, you have to start with one of their tasty apps which I almost always get the Cheese Curds. For food, the small menu is nice because it limits your options. I haven't had a bad experience with any of my entrees but I really enjoy the Graze Burger. 

The only two reasons I did not give it a 5 star is that they do not do reserve seating and there is almost always a wait. The nice thing though is they text you when your table is ready.

Overall, will continue to go back and refer people to Graze"}
{"text":"This menu just tickles me and makes me jolly. Anything from deviled eggs to local trout with sweet potato gems and fried leek strings to warm cookies from the oven. 
Staff are knowledgeable. Wine list is good. Service is impeccable. 
No reservations; so, do be prepared to wait, but it's worth every minute!
The burger is the best I've ever had and even the fries are local and organically grown and taste as if they've had truffle oil drizzled on them...amazing."}
{"text":"Came on a Tuesday for lunch. The smash burger is delicious, and the fries are a good mix of soft/crispy with aioli dipping sauce. Pro tip: for the farmers provolone Sammy you can add a protein (I did chicken)! Yum! Cheese curds are also amazin!! The batter isn't too heavy and it tastes really unique. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Its gone downhill in my book.  Last few times there the menu has been less ambitious (read: no marrow) and the entrees have been very overpriced for what they are.  

The cheese plate was terrible (a travesty). 

The staff just doesn't seem to care as much anymore.  Perhaps their popularity has allowed them to rest on their laurels.  

I probably won't be back anytime soon (and I was an early defender of this place)."}
{"text":"Best service,  best pork mac and cheese I ever had....ever! The pasta was made from scratch, the cheese was absolotely perfect and the cheese curds were phenomenal!  No doubt,  the best cheesecake I ever had in my freaking life.  What made this 5 stars was our waitress!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to Graze on May 30 to have my post-birthday celebration. What a beautiful space - volume ceilings and so much natural light! My first impression was a good one. It's a laid back/casual environment which I really enjoyed.  Our server, Jesse L., was just so lovely and genuine - she took great care of us. The rhubarb lemonade and wine were all so good! We had heard a lot about the cheese curds so we ordered those as an appetizer to share.  They were wonderful and honestly, the most enormous cheese curds I've ever seen. My only disappointment was the \"ranch\" dipping sauce which was just way too sweet for my taste.

For dinner, my husband got the mac & cheese with pork and the asparagus appetizer as a side. Both were very, very tastey. I ordered the $21 Graze burger and people, seriously, it was worth every penny. The rich, decadent combination of meats smothered with caramelzied onions on a brioche bun - it was ridiculously good! I paired it with the greens covered in a champagne viniagrette that was a perfect, light pairing to my burger. My mom got the chicken and waffles which she loved - cinnamon, cardamom, salty, crunchy, golden goodness. And my mom's girlfriend went with the lemongrass sausages & coconut rice - she was very happy with her dinner as well. It was a great first experience and we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in madison! Highly recommend the bimbimbap. Burgers are great and are the curds and apps. Cocktails are phenomenal made to order with fresh garnishes. Hands down a great madison square spot!"}
{"text":"I love Graze! I haven't had anything on the menu that I haven't enjoyed.

Our table of 4 started off with a whole bunch of appetizers, including the deviled eggs, soft pretzel, fries, and cheese curds. My favorites were the cheese curds and the soft pretzel, mostly because of the three different mustards that came with the pretzel.

After finishing off our appetizers, I didn't have room for a full entree (though I'm definitely getting the Bibimbap next time), so I split an order of the curry vegetables. They came with lemon and garlic aioli, but the veggies were very flavorful all on their own.

For dessert, I ordered their special, which was something along the lines of a dense raspberry brownie with vanilla ice cream. It was pretty good, but OMG the chocolate chip cookies!! that my bf ordered were so much better. These are not your average bake sale cookies and are definitely worth $6 for 3. They are crispy on the outside and warm and chewy on the inside, AND they are slightly salty, which perfectly complements the sweet chocolate. I couldn't tell if the salt was in the dough or sprinkled on top of the cookie because it was kind of dark in the restaurant, but either way, DELICIOUS.

The restaurant space itself is a treat. Huge floor to ceiling windows give you a straight-on view of the capitol. I've been for brunch in the past, too, and the whole room is filled with warm sunlight during the day.

Overall, Graze is worth the wait for a table - and you probably will have to wait because this place is popular and doesn't take reservations. 

I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic dining experience!

Graze caters my company's annual anniversary dinner so we had a pretty good experience with them about a year ago.  After seeing that our normal brunch was overloaded, we wandered downtown Madison and wandered into Graze.  This place is joining our restaurant rotation.

Everything here is local and they list the farmers and local organic places they support with the food that they're producing.  The results are really delicious foods that surprisingly won't break the bank.  

I had the Ramen noodle bowl and my girlfriend had the Nutella stuffed French Toast.  Both were really, really good.  Graze additionally has lemonade that is flavored with a seasonal fruit (in our case, Plum).  This was also delicious.

What really took the cake was the vodka battered cheese curds.  Amazing.  Probably now my favorite cheese curds ever.  The housemade dill ranch they serve with it was out of this world.  So far I've used yelp to highlight the best and the worst places only.  If I could extra star highlight Graze, I would."}
{"text":"We did Saturday brunch here and loved it. 

(+) We stopped by after seeing staff dragging a stocked Graze wagon away from the farmer's market. Good sign. 

(+) Atmosphere: The building has tons of natural light and great views of the square. The place was very busy but staff was friendly and our server was very helpful and genuine. They had a couple of specials (don't bother telling me about tofu, I'm a meat eater), both interesting food and drinks and a healthy mix of patrons (none of that pretentious hipsters only garbage). 

(++) Food: We had amazing Bloody Mary specials (pickle and pepper infused vodka, yum!) each served with a Spotted Cow chaser and olive and cheese curd skewer. My boyfriend ordered the pork shoulder ramen bowl and I had eggs Benedict. Both were very well-executed, nothing too fancy. I'd love to stop back and try some of their artisanal cheeses and other cocktails!"}
{"text":"Seriously people...I walked out of here in a food coma! DELICIOUS!!! Try their truffle popcorn and cheese board."}
{"text":"Wait was long on a Friday after graduation, menu limited but thoughtful. Terrace overlooking capital was special. Enjoyed their specialty burger and the heavenly mac and cheese, and the bread pudding! Great service. But it's pricey."}
{"text":"Let's start with the positive. Service is excellent and for the most part, the food was good. However now for the completely appalling part. We ordered Steak Frites which was listed on the menu as market price. It showed up as about 3 - 4 ounces of tough, gristly sirloin. It was literally less than a half inch thick and totally over cooked. (I mean how can you control temp on a half inch). We ate it despite our disappointment but the insult added to injury was when we got the bill. Thirty four dollars. I'm not even kidding - for 4 ounces max of 1/2 inch thick sirloin. Do the math on that. That's 136 dollars a pound. I know there were French fries and overhead mark up but any way you look at it, that's taking advantage and completely fraudulent as far as I'm concerned. I love good, local food and have no trouble paying for it but if you are going to charge $34 for a steak dish, it better be rib eye or filet or have something about it that justifies the cost. I am truly disgusted on principle alone."}
{"text":"This is a pretty cool spot with beautiful views of the capitol. The food is quite good. I'm a huge fan of Tory Miller (owner and head chef), so I wish I could give Graze 5 stars... but, it's just missing something. Although, the bibimbap gets 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"I don't like places that act like they are doing me a favor by letting me eat there.  They may have good food, but the quantities are small, the prices are high, and dinner comes with a side of attitude. I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Amazing place to spend an evening overlooking the capital. The taste rivals some of Chicago's best...."}
{"text":"I went to Graze three times, and I must say, there's a reason I keep going back. The staff was very competent (especially the servers). They really knew what they were talking about and were able to tell me what ingredients were in the menu (and for a menu that's changing with the seasons, that's very impressive). The servers were also very attentive and patient, and I had a positive experience all around. Though the wait was quite long every time (without the option to set a reservation), I would say it was worth the wait each time.

Every time I have gone, I always get the bone marrow and my boyfriend gets the cheese curds. The bone marrow at Graze is definitely the best I've had in Madison. I also love the mussels on the menu with the side of bread they offer. With the changing menu, I'm always excited to try new things. Although on the slightly expensive side, definitely worth it. I recommend going on a date or taking your parents when they visit to really impress them. I've gone for both brunch and dinner, and dinner was a slightly better experience, but I do recommend trying both."}
{"text":"Graze is one of those places you go to for the actual place, not necessarily the food. It's got a gorgeous view and a beautiful ambiance in the restaurant. The setting is just awesome and I could probably write five pretentious paragraphs on this alone, but I'll spare you and just tell you that the interior is worth visiting at least once.

The service is four stars: I initially came here on a Saturday brunch and picked out the chicken fried steak--as it turns out, they were out and my waiter didn't know. I'm not faulting the waiter, but I do think if there was a little better communication, this could have been avoided.

That said, otherwise, my waiter knew what he was talking about (as some other reviewers mentioned). Interestingly, I didn't get carded when I ordered my mimosa (which was all right). I'm not complaining, mind you, because I am 22 and I am of age, but it's quite rare for me and I'm kind of grateful for that.

Now, while the logistics of this place are great, the menu and food are kind of where it falls apart:

The Sassy Cow cheese curds are divine. I love The Old Fashioned, but you know what? I think these cheese curds put theirs to shame. Oh, please don't hate me for saying that--it's just, they're HUGE. And delicious. I wish I just would have ordered some for myself, even though they fed two early-20-somethings just fine. Ugh, I'm greedy, don't judge me.

But where the cheese curds were good, my croque-madame was not. It was almost like eating a microwaved TV dinner, albeit a little more expensive one. It was greasy and it was nothing I couldn't have gotten for $4 at Madison Market a few blocks away. For being a glorified microwaved TV dinner, you know, it was all right, but I expected a little more. The salad was good and I wolfed that sucker down, but eh. Really? My partner also didn't enjoy his corned beef hash as much--there was little flavor to his dish and the amount of grease was a little unbearable for him.

As others have mentioned: if they worked on the menu, cooking ability, and some of the dishes (more local ingredients would be fantastic, especially if you're going to pride yourself on it) could really use some fine-tuning and adjustments."}
{"text":"This restaurant is beautiful-floor to ceiling windows, a great big bar in the center of hte restaurant. I love the farm to table concept but the food I ate today for lunch was just okay. My cocktail was delicious. Service was average. 

I ordered the sage bourbon cocktail, shared the pork buns and then had a turkey wrap with a side salad. The cocktail was awesome, I can't say anything else, not too bourbon-y an the sage came through. 

The pork buns, were not traditional pork buns. They were pork bun sandwiches with pork, kimchi and sauce on them. They were okay. The buns were a bit soggy and the kimchi was difficult to bit into but they were still pretty good. Just not your traditional pork bun so it was a bit disappointing when they came out. 

The turkey wrap, served w/ peppers (I was warned it was spicy) was not spicy. It was really just okay. The turkey in the wrap was plentiful but needed salt. So I ended up putting a lot of chipolte mayo on it to give it some flavor. The saving grace to this meal was the wonderful side salad that came with radishes and herbs and cucumbers. It was light and had a pleasant balance of so many mixed greens.

I'd go here again to try more of the cocktails but would probably go next door for dinner or try one of the many other restaurants on the square."}
{"text":"This is a great place. Good crowds and friendly service, good food and great drinks. 

Our first visit we had bone marrow and this is the best that we've had. We also had pork belly bun outstanding! and full of flavors. Lastly, we had the cheese curds. This is the first time we've had it and it was good.   

The next day he had eggs Benedict and noodle bowl and we loved it. Also, the spicy bloody mary was awesome! With A beer chaser wow! 

If we ever come back to Madison, this is the first place that we will go to."}
{"text":"I really want to love Graze--the location is great, I love the atmosphere and the big glass windows, the view of the capitol, I even like their name.

But...each time I go the food is just average. It's good enough, but I've never been blown away. I also think it's a little overpriced. 

They have a good drink menu, and if you are going to go for any meal, I think brunch is the best they have to offer. 

Also be advised that they do not accept reservations."}
{"text":"This is a really good restaurant. It's very interesting it has unique dishes. The food is physically beautiful and the atmosphere is nice open and relaxed. It feels clean and enjoyable. The only thing that I remember not liking is that was a bit loud."}
{"text":"Best place for brunch in Madison.  The atmosphere is unlike any other.  Great mimosas and bloody marys.  Food is always consistently good, but not the best I've had.  I'll always return for Sunday fun day with my girlfriends."}
{"text":"I just have to add that I went there yesterday for brunch and the menu has been vastly updated. Their Bibimbap Burrito is awesome. I am not a vegetarian but I love vegetarian fare and so when I saw it could be made with tofu I was like let's roll the dice and see if it hits it's mark. The marinated tofu in the burrito has such a nummy flavor of spice and chili without totally dominating the natural flavor of the tofu. The rice inside is crispy, the vegetables are crunchy and all of it is wrapped in a fried egg, then a tortilla, and then covered in a spicy peanut and chili sauce topped with some oh so spicy kimchee. I was extremely impressed, so check it out! I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is a fun place to grab a bite and a drink.  Some of the food hit, others didn't', but all of it was tasty.  It really is a nice space, the view of the capitol and the location are two key selling points; the focus on local food is commendable and appreciated."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in madison! The food is delicious and I haven't had a bad meal there yet. Their cheese curds are to die for the bimbimbap I think it's called is very good as well as their pub burger. So good! go!!"}
{"text":"Very impressed.  

Everything was spectacular.  From the spot itself, and it's ambiance, to the well thought out menu, locavore food, preperation, delivery, and service.  Well done!

I started out with a WI made saison with rhubarb.  Unique and delicious.  

For some reason I am a complete sucker for wedge salads.  Had to give it a try.  Glad I did.  This wedge is a little less typical, including the obligatory iceberg lettuce, but topped with smoked mushroom, blue cheese, ranch & sesame \"french\" dressing.  Outstanding.  

For my entree I went with a vegetarian option.  This is not something I normally do.  No meat, all vegetarian usually screams \"side dish\" to me.  I couldn't resist with this though.  Pan fried rye gnocci tossed with a variety of roasted veggies and a cauliflower puree.  Not only was it beautiful, it was absolutely delicious.  The order was on the smaller side, but honestly I was happy.  In the meantime I had added on a couple of WI based IPA's and was starting to get full.  I was happy to have room for some cheese to finish the night.

Ended my night with a bottle of WI Belgian sour cherry lambic style beer along with a selection of cheeses.  There were a great number of cheeses to choose from, from at least 4 different WI area farms.  My only complaint, and it is small - the printed descriptions of the cheese were lacking information.  Just as happens with craft beers these days, I have no idea what \"old curmudgeon\" is.  Thankfully my server jumped to action and came up with 4 selections, one from each farm, and all different from each other.  He also hand wrote a quick note to me, explaining what each cheese was.  Great service - very well done.

Graze is  a very rare, well polished, locally concerned, gem of a restaurant.  
The staff is so professional, knowledgeable, and well trained, that their service comes off as casual, and completely un-stuffy.

{"text":"As advertised: fresh and very good. Roasted vegetable app was prepared well. Vegetables crisp and well seasoned. Aoli was excellently tart to accentuate the veggies. Bibimbop was great. Fried rice stop were a nice modification and provided a good crunch along with the veggies. I got the spicy pork which added a nice heat. Will come back when in town again!"}
{"text":"Been to Graze about 4 times now.

Drinks: Tasty and creative. I've always had cocktails. Can't speak to the beer experience. They're simpler than the drinks at Merchant but still good.

Food: Delicious. You can tell the chefs are passionate about what they do. One of the juiciest burgers I've ever had. I've had the cheese board as well with a group of friends and that was fun. Never heard a single complaint from the people I've gone with.

Service: Never a complaint. Haven't had too much of a wait ever either.

Atmosphere: It's trendy but this is Wisconsin so you're never under-dressed.

Summary: Graze is quite a treat for brunch, lunch, or dinner. If you've never been, definitely give a try."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Graze. I thought the atmosphere was awesome. The service was great and the food was phenomenal. I had the Graze burger and it was delicious. We had a well recommended bottle of wine and finished the night with the bourbon pecan pie. I would highly recommend this restaurant for anyone looking for a great place to eat with good service and a great view."}
{"text":"Graze is one of the more trendy, vibrant, and environmentally conscious spots in Madison. Their menu has healthy options, the staff is friendly, and it is a reliable spot to take friends or family! I think their portion sizes could be a bit larger considering the prices and would probabaly not consider this one of my go to restaurants in Madison but they are consistent and offer great service."}
{"text":"WIthout a doubt, my favorite restaurant in Madison. It's always packed, so be prepared to wait.

I've never had a bad meal or cocktail here. Their cheese curds are the best I've had in Madison (and yes, they blow Old Fashioned out of the water). Bibimbap is amazing. Chicken and waffles is the best I've had.

The ambiance is really great and there are windows everywhere so you can people-watch or whatever. Staff is generally very friendly. Overall, not a single bad thing to say about this place."}
{"text":"I considered only rating 2 stars just to offset how overrated I think this place is, but I'll stick with the honest 3.

I'll start with the positive: The food is generally pretty good. I've had satisfying brunch, lunch, and dinner at Graze. They usually carry a selection of both East and West coast oysters of pretty good freshness and quality.  The interior is clean and modern with floor to ceiling windows that frame the State Capitol building.

The service here is mediocre. The host/server handoff is sometimes botched and the waiters are not exactly attentive. Brunch and lunch are the big culprits but I've seen this happen at dinner as well.

The cocktails often contain a splash of \"surprise\" soda water. Whether you prefer cocktails \"straight\" or lean toward the carbonation, just be aware that the menu doesn't exactly specify so you might wanna ask.

Most of the main ingredients are locally sourced... this explains the dearth of options and high prices. A whole page of the menu is devoted to describing which farm a certain vegetable came from . Locally sourced food is a cool concept but at Graze it seems a little preachy and gimicky."}
{"text":"I went to Graze for lunch with my aunt and uncle who were visiting. I remember my aunt's order better than my own. She got a Bibimpap Korean burrito. I'm not a big fan of kimchi, but it was yummy with just enough allusions to Korean flavors.. yet, I think,it was toned down for the sake of your average person's \"spicy!\" threshold 


I ended up with the leftovers from the burrito, and then some soup which I currently forget.. but was yummy as well.

As I write, I'm remembering what I couldn't stop eating: we ordered deep fried cheese curds. Whatever they put out as dipping sauce, don't stop!
Could it have been as simple as like a garlic mayo? Insanely delicious. 
Environment, 5/5 of course.
That's all I've got."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison!!! Their wait staff are amazing. I've had many of the main plates and never been less than impressed. Serving sizes are usually large, I always have leftovers for lunch the following day. Their cocktails are delicious, although some of their themed ones fall a little short in my opinion. My boyfriend ordered the \"I am groot\" one of the last times we were there and we were both underwhelmed by it. I especially like the ambiance of the restaurant after dark when they open the shades all the way and you can see the lit capital. I always recommend coming here."}
{"text":"We received a gift certificate to Graze and held off using it but were we glad that we did! There was a wait but our phone number was taken and before they could call us spots opened at the bar so we dined there. We tried several appetizers, all of which were delicious and shared a meal-rabbit. The bartender was extremely helpful and the Magic coffee was amazing! It was a good value!"}
{"text":"Overall: it doesn't taste as good as the food or the place looks.

1. The space and the environment are gorgeous, from the lighting to the windows and bar. It's a very fun and pleasing place to be.
2. The bar has an interesting cocktail selecting and solid microbrews for decent prices.
3. The food is simply okay, here's a breakdown:
-Appetizers: The pork buns were tasty. The cheese curds were good, but still behind the Old Fashioned's and weren't as hot as they should've been.
-Entree: I ordered the \"Pork^3\" which came with pulled pork, short ribs, sausage, and Mac & Cheese. The Mac and Cheese and the ribs were tasty, though one set of ribs was a bit burned. The pulled pork was relatively flavorless. The sausage had no flavor and was cold.

Overall, I expected more, but I'll give them another shot.

4. Our waitress paid marginal attention to us."}
{"text":"This farm-to-table concept pub does Wisconsin farmers justice. Their use of local food is incredible and the menu was very creative. I had the chicken and waffles which were awesome. They give you some Wisconsin maple syrup and this unique spiced compound butter that was to die for! 

Great service and very nice interior. Only downside is they don't take reservations, and their brunch gets very busy. I would get there early!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch today.  The brunch menu is pretty standard/limited with benedicts, posh breakfast sandwiches, country fried steak, a la carte sides (potatoes, fruit, etc...) and then there is ... chicken & waffles.  I was pressured into ordering it and it twas one of the best things that has ever entered my mouth (in any manner).  The compound butter accents the sweet/salty play very nicely.  I had never had this dish before, but i'd be curious as how to others stack up.  Staff were friendly, the space is very modern but cozy.  I would have no problem checking Graze out again."}
{"text":"Our party of three arrived around 6pm on a Friday night and we were promptly seated... when the greeter managed to look up and actually greet us.

However, our waitress was wonderful; engaging and knowledgeable.  She was able to talk about the wine we selected in a way that was helpful and pretty accurate.  She shared with us that she had lived in Spain (we ordered a Spanish wine) and her recommendations were appreciated.  It was nice rapport without feeling forced.

We ordered the cheese curds in the vodka batter and they were pretty good; light and crispy and greasy.  We also ordered the soft pretzel with three different kinds of mustard and Widmer's cheese spread.  The cheese was to die for, the mustards were great.

I ordered the Pork3:  chili braised pork shoulder, pickled vegetables, rice, and leaf lettuce;  Udon noodle bowl with glazed pork belly and sugar snap peas;  smoked pork spare ribs with Korean mustard sauce, cucumber salad.  Pretty good.  The spare ribs were... well, spare.  Very small meat cuts on the ribs, very hard to bite into.  The pork belly was good.  The small ramen bowl was gone much too quickly and there were no promised peas in my bowl.  The braised pork shoulder tasted delicious but I think some sort of sauce could have helped texturally; it was too much like eating a Big League Chew wad of shredded pork.  The pickled veggies were great.

My dining partners ordered the gnocchi and the Graze burger.

Side note:  It would be nice if there was a way to tell by looking at the menu exactly where the food is coming from.  Are the mussels actually local?

The reviews about the noise level in this restaurant are accurate.  We had to leave eventually in order to hear each other talk.  I do not think the Graze/L'etoile comparison is necessarily a fair one.  I had one of the most amazing meals of my life at L'etoile and Graze has a totally different menu and technique.

Lastly, I wish there was an easy way to let Graze know that their domain name is missing the letter \"E\" when you search for them on Google.  Drives me nuts. ;-)"}
{"text":"Such a great dining experience! Knowledgeable staff, friendly atmosphere, and fine foods. 

The dining area is seating around a charming bar and floor to ceiling windows, showcasing the town and Capitol building.

I will absolutely be back for the deviled eggs. Graze managed to make a classic appetizer so perfect and addicting it's easily worth a trip back."}
{"text":"Whether dining from breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, or a late night meal, Graze offers a spectacular dining experience. Much akin to its more sophisticated sister restaurant, L'Etoile, Graze serves a menu based on local foods. The dairy products offered from the Sassy Cow Creamery are particularly great, I would certainly recommend the fried cheese curds. The dessert menu changes regularly, and you'll certainly be able to find a pie that suits your fancy.

For those that remember Cafe Soleil, the same croissants are offered every morning at Graze, including their exquisite pain au chocolate. In addition, a full breakfast menu is available to tantalize your taste buds.

The atmosphere is a bit more casual than L'Etoile, though offers the same fantastic view of the capital square. While they do not accept reservations, seating has not been an issue for the multiple times that I've enjoyed a meal at Graze."}
{"text":"The city of Madison is blessed to have many restaurants at the forefront of the local farm to table movement with perhaps Graze leading theOHMYGOD THE KOREAN BBQ PORK SANDWICH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! have you tried this thing?!?!?!? GOOD LORD SO FNG GOOOOOOD makes me want to just snuggle and hold it gently and love it forever then let it love me back i love your spicy juiciness and juicy spiciness graze korean bbq pork sandwich"}
{"text":"Gong to bump them up one star. I met a group there for lunch the other day and was happy to see that they brought some of the influence from Sujeo, what I consider this group's best effort, over on to this menu. It was a large group so I got to try several dishes around the table. I personally had the Korean short (marinated pork shoulder, Hook's pepperjack cheese, kimchee coleslaw, hoisin on sesame brioche). It was nice. For me it could have used more spice. I tried to track down our server to bring me some sciracha but had the same old problem at this place. Could not get anyone's attention. 

I tried the Sweet Potato Falafel Salad (mixed greens, feta, cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, red onion, grilled pita, tahini yogurt vinaigrette) and I gotta say, it was nasty. It had the flavor of falafel, but it was just mushy. Two of the people at the table ordered it and both agreed they wouldn't order it again. It lacked crunch and texture. 

Overall, though it was a bit better and some of the food I sampled around the table was pretty good including mine, so I'm bumping them up to a 3 from my original 2 on the first two visits."}
{"text":"Tasty food.  Small menu.  Beautiful dining room.  We were really cold the other night - must be hard to heat/ac because it's all windows."}
{"text":"After all the talk of how wonderful this place was it was just o.k.   The atmosphere is nice, a bit pretentious, but nice.  They have a good selection of beer and our waitress was awesome!!!  Now, the food...the cheese curds were amazing (what wouldn't be good about vodka and cheese together...seriously) One of my friends and I each ordered the friday night fish and I was a bit confused as to how they portion everything out.  My basket had minimal fries (they were deliecious) and 2 pieces of fish while her basket at 3 1/2 pieces of fish and was exploding with fries.  One would think that ordering the exact same thing it would be presented the similar or the same at the same table.  Another one of our friends ordered the trout which was o.k and another the steak which was delicious but there was nothing but a piece of meat about half the size of my palm on her plate.  I felt it was over priced for what you actually got.  I know a couple people have ranted and raved how this is \"high-end food\" but it is over priced high end food."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the hype. I also don't understand how this place receives such positive reviews. I'm honestly not super-critical of establishments but this food was not good. 

My hamburger tasted like the meat had been frozen, what's worse is that I opted for the larger, better beef burger. It reminded me of really cheap cookout meat that you throw on the grill and douse in ketchup in order to keep it down. The fries were tiny and shriveled, and the cheese curds were so big and gooey it seemed almost too unhealthy and just plain gross (and you have to remember, us people who order cheese curds as an appetizer usually don't care about the calories). Every side option costs an additional chunk of change, which I'm perfectly fine with, except none of these sides were worth said money. Trying too hard to be like the 5-star restaurants, serving up the 1-star food.

The only thing this place has going for it is location and feel. It's very modern inside, very clean, and classy (poor quality food was a huge shock). Being located right next to the Capitol makes it very easy to walk to and places it in a very popular area of Madison. The waitress was friendly and my friends and I had a good time, but it seemed like all we did was try to convince ourselves that the next course would taste better and live up to the reviews we'd see online. 

In the restaurants defense burgers may not be their specialty and I could've just picked the wrong thing, I would highly recommend they remove them from their menu. My one friend got a burger as well, he would agree that it was beyond sub-par. My other friend got a side of macaroni, she didn't like it but when I gave it a try I thought it was alright. Better than what I ordered at least."}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food, atmosphere, and service at Graze.  Always a solid choice in my book."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone visiting Madison! Even though the menu is limited to one page, the food is absolutely amazing. Not to mention that everything is locally sourced! I was with a group of people on a business trip and we decided to try quite a few different things. We started with the sangria for our drinks. I am not a sangria person but I must say this one was mighty tasty! We got three appetizers: oysters (very fresh), cheese curds (the dipping sauce was amazing) and then the deviled eggs. I must say that the deviled eggs were some of the tastiest deviled eggs I've ever had. Moving on to main course, I got the chicken and pickles. It's their version of chicken and waffles with a maple syrup and fresh pickles (the pickles could be a dish on their own because they are just that tasty). The chicken and waffles were some of the best I've ever had. The flavor was on point and everything was just cooked perfectly. The last thing I want to mention was the service. I must say he service was 5 stars in itself. The staff were super nice and very informative on all of the menu items. Yes, I would definitely recommend this place and would come back myself for sure! Our entire group was extremely satisfied with all of our meals!"}
{"text":"Great for groups! They are willing to split a check 6+ ways and won't even act annoyed :)

I've gone a few times with groups where we share a 2-3 appetizers, etc. The bill will charge you for 1/x of an item that you split. A nice plus you don't run into very often.

The menu usually has unique items on it along with some 'ole trusties.

Portion sizes tend to be on the small side for my fat American expectations. But the food is good quality and is sourced locally so you can pat yourself on the back for that one.

Great place to take out-of-town visitors."}
{"text":"it's got this great, modern ambiance to it but the food is just okay.  the bibimbap is nowhere near authentic and the pork buns were disappointingly over priced.  the popcorn is good tho, ill give it that."}
{"text":"I've only ever had lunch here. It was all right. Nothing special, except for the view. 

The cheese curds had a crisp, light batter, but the pieces of cheese were just too big. The thing about proper Madisonian cheese curds is that they're small enough to somehow justify eating a couple, and they're like little bites of joy. Graze's are like heart attack poufs. You can barely finish one.

I had a sandwich. Roasted turkey on cranberry mustard sounded really good, but it was a little bland...you couldn't even tell there was mustard in there, maybe it was forgotten. There was something funny about the butternut squash soup that came with it, too - too raw-tasting. 

But I would definitely try it for dinner; I have a feeling I just got there on an off day."}
{"text":"We were in Madison for a short stay and happen to pass by Graze. It looked interesting and has a Great location and good ambience too. It does have a Limited menu especially if you are vegetarian but the food is tasty."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We started sitting outside, but when it started to rain a little, the generous and super accommodating waitress moved us to a table inside, no problem. And the view of the capital building made the move enjoyable! This whole situation coulda real annoying, but wasn't at all.

We ordered cheese curds (cause Wisconsin), not like anything I've ever had in Chicago. A bunch of delicious oysters. But the highlight of our meal here was the beet burger we ordered and split. I'm not even a fan of veggy burgers, and the idea that it was on an \"english muffin\" was a turn off for me, but this thing was amazing. The english muffin was exactly perfect. The beet burger itself was perfection.

I also ordered a mint cucumber drink that was so delicious, but I'm not seeing it on the menu right now. It was called something like Mid-summer's mint dream."}
{"text":"Fancy place! With affordable prices!

Came for drinks and appetizers. Was very pleased. Clever cocktails and fun appetizers.

Their fried cheese curds have this fluffiness about them. Small clouds of happiness. 

Their menu has some Korean persuasion which definitely intrigued me. Can't wait to come back for dinner one day and do another review!"}
{"text":"Graze will always hold a special place in my heart.  I've been there probably more times than I can count, and I have been beyond pleased with my experience every single time.    The views of the capitol through the towering glass windows warrant a visit in and of themselves.  It is about as good of a view as you can get of the capitol from indoors.  Add the view and the overall cool, laid-back atmosphere to a top-notch, eclectic menu, and you have an incredible dining experience that is uniquely Madison.  

Like I said, I've been to Graze a lot, and I've loved everything I've tried.  Menu items change, and all the seasonal menu items that I've tried have wow-ed me.  I have fond memories of a braised beef brisket that simply melted in my mouth.

In terms of the continuous menu items, the Bipimbap my personal favorite.  They let you know it's spicy, and they are NOT lying, but it is also fresh, flavorful, savory, and unlike anything I've ever tried before.  The cheese curds (!!!) are my favorite in Madison.  They're huge, coated in just the right amount of breading, and served alongside a divine ranch sauce.  

The drinks are also commendable.  They're incredibly unique and perfectly mixed (also, NOT weak).  Totally worth the money.

I highly recommend Graze to anyone and everyone, and I've brought almost everyone I care about here at least once (everyone has raved about it, and I have a feeling it wasn't just to make sure I didn't feel bad).

I love you Graze! Always and forever!"}
{"text":"Graze offers inventive and delicious food without pretention or cliché. From burgers, fried chicken, and the best cheese curds in Madison to pork buns, bimbimbap, and grilled smoked tofu, no taste goes unsatisfied.  

My first experience at Graze came on a warm April night.  As I walked in, I was immediately struck by the all-glass walls that bathed the entire restaurant in the bright lights of Capitol Square. My group and I were led through the lively dining room to our table, and we began to pore over the eclectic menu. 

I ordered the pork buns as an appetizer along with the rainbow trout.  We also split an order of cheese curds for the table. The curds were crispy, melty, squeaky, deep-fried perfection. Paired with a house-made ranch sauce, they were a perfect start to our meal at Graze.

Next were the pork buns, which momentarily transported me from Capitol Square to a large dim sum banquet hall.  Pillowy steamed buns gave way to rich pork belly and sweet hoisin sauce, with crunch kimchee providing artfully balanced acidity.

The rainbow trout was the least memorable of the dishes, but was stll very tasty. The fish was lightly seared with crispy skin and flaky flesh.  Lightly sautéed greens and a tarragon vinaigrette provided a pleasant finish to the dish.

Graze is a fantastic restaurant with inventive food, impressive service, and a dining room humming with excitement.  As is the case at many great restaurants, the entrees don't quite measure up to the more whimsical small plates.  But it hardly seems fair to complain after a meal as good as this one!"}
{"text":"Great food and customer service! I had the corned beef hash which was great! The cheese curds were awesome but the sauce that comes with the cheese curds was kind of gross."}
{"text":"Brunch at Graze did not disappoint!  The Nutella French toast with apples was superb as was the cheese curds and the open, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"It took me awhile to come around to Graze. My first visit (probably 5 or so years ago) was underwhelming. Not bad, just not as spectacular as I expected from all the buzz. I went during brunch and ordered the Nutella french toast. I received a few tiny (one inch by two inch) thinly-sliced and nearly-blackened pieces of baguette with a schmear of Nutella. Not exactly what I envisioned from a ten-dollar plate called \"Nutella-Stuffed French Toast.\" 

Next up was a couple of years ago for a birthday slice of Hickory Nut Bourbon-Caramel pie and a cocktail. The pie had a sophisticated flavor profile that I enjoyed but it wasn't quite knocking my socks off (just due to personal preferences, not any lack of quality or talent on account of the chefs). 

Third visit: lunch. I had an amazing seasonal cocktail, the name nor details of which I can't remember, and the Farmer John's Provolone sandwich. Flavors were on point but it was so messy that I was able to eat about three bites during my lunch meeting. The baguette was very crusty and difficult to bite through, causing the saucy, juicy ingredients to squish out everywhere. On my most recent visit (details forthcoming) a friend ordered it and subbed sliced sandwich bread for the baguette and it looked phenomenal. No lost insides!

Visit four: the turning point. While Graze's menu isn't huge, it does span a wide range of styles and I finally found something that really spoke to me - the Thai Crispy Rice. Bacon, avocado, peanuts, radish, and a host of herbs are served on top of a sliced block of crispy rice. So, so good, and the perfect portion for lunch. I ordered mine without the egg, and I think in the future I'll request some extra avocado in its stead. Seems like a fair trade, yeah? I also had a tasty hot cider & bourbon cocktail. 

Next on the list: those amazing-looking cheese curds to seal the deal."}
{"text":"The pastries here are to die for! Only catch is they sell them outside their brick and mortar store on Saturdays only. Almond croissant and sausage croissant both A+. If I ever find myself back in Madison on Saturday, you will find me here. 

We came back Sunday in hopes for more croissants, but sadly found out they only serve them on Saturdays. We still had brunch and enjoyed it but I have daydreams about those croissants."}
{"text":"Great service- even better food had the loaded breakfast sandwich the egg was cooked perfectly the hubby ordered the bagel and lox -very fresh. Has the cheese curds to start with- best decision ever. Very happy with food and service."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the buzz is about Graze. The service was fine but I found the menu uninspiring.  There were six of us our table. so a variety of dishes were ordered.  

We started with a cheese plate. The selections were decent enough and tasty, but I thought the servings were a bit on the small side. If you are from the greater Madison area, all the cheese selections we ordered were easily found at a decent market or grocery store.

I ordered the Chicken and Waffle. It was said to be something of a signature dish at Graze. The chicken was bland and and  not at all tender. The waffle cold,  essentially flavorless and flat. The waffle was cold enough that the savory butter on the waffle refused to melt at all. The quintessential Chicken and Waffle dish should have a plump, yet crispy savory couple of pieces of chicken atop a crisp thick, slightly sweet waffle. 

A couple of people ordered the Mac & Cheese... a bit pricey for the size of the dish... the serving looked more like a side dish. This said, those that ordered it said it was very rich and satisfying.  Another in our party ordered the Bip Bop. It looked pretty good and yet another ordered the Market Grilled Steak. It looked decent. I think the star and most memorable aspect of the of the night was the Sticky Pudding. This was really good, very rich, and I dare say sticky. 

I just expected more from Graze... if I am going to pay a premium for comfort food, it should wow me... I should be contemplating what I am going to order on my next visit.  I could have ordered a burger... but I'm pretty particular about my burgers... The $12 burger seemed pretty standard for the price tag... The $21 burger looked intriguing, but not $21 intriguing. It may be the Capitol Square, but it's not Michigan Avenue.

Would I go back - I doubt it..."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was classy and new age, service was wonderful. For apps we had the pork buns and cheese curds. Both were very good. I had the smashburger, it was okay. Wish they had a thicker burger so I could taste the beef. My wife had the mac n cheese which was amazing, I was totally jealous. We'll be back next time in town to see what's new."}
{"text":"Meh.

The food is way overrated and expensive for what you get. I've been under whelmed the 3 or 4 times I've been there. There's so many great places to eat in this town I just don't get how this does so well. It's twice as expensive with small portions and below average food. 

Also there's a bartender is a really not nice lady."}
{"text":"Graze is definitely an experience- the food is unique and delicious. However, be prepared for the wait! I made the mistake of going to Graze with a party of 8 and we had to wait for about an hour and a half. I'd recommend going to the restaurant on the week days (where you will probably still wait) or with smaller parties.

Otherwise, good food and a fun atmosphere. I think the menu is reasonably priced and they use a local food which is always a plus! I ate the bibimbap and loved it but everything else looked amazing too.

Based on my experience, I'd recommend trying the popcorn appetizer which uses truffle oil and the wedge salad, which has a unique asian flare."}
{"text":"Three of us went for Sunday brunch at 1:30.  Although we weren't seated immediately it was a short wait, less than 10 minutes.  The restaurant had cleared out enough that we didn't feel rushed to eat.

The server kindly substituted avocado for the ham in my eggs benedict, a delicious substitution I might add.

The restrooms are clean although with only 2 stalls it can get crowded.

Overall, the experience was good and with so many tempting items on the menu we'll be back!"}
{"text":"booo. where are all these good reviews coming from? go here if you wana overpay for a poorley planned menu and some ridiculous waiters who arent sure what level of resturant they are representing"}
{"text":"I'm inclined to give four stars by inertia alone, but the ambiance didn't compensate for the food. I, too, am into local producers, but if the nuances in the food were anything more than an experiment, they were lost on my palate.

First, the baffling: I don't know how you can justify heating a giant glass cube in Madison, considering its winter months. (Maybe it's beautiful in the summer, I'll withhold judgment.) The glass wasn't that thick, at least on the sides.

The menu is on the pricier side (certainly to justify heating the cube), lots of hip, \"artisanal\" stuff, which is fine. The local root beer and soft pretzel appetizer were excellent (though the mustards were mostly miss and the cheese tasted like fancy spray cheese). Tofu can be inconsistent, but theirs was fine. The ferro/quinoa-esque grains had some hard pieces that may have caused some tooth damage.

Wait service was adequate. No wait to get in. Madison is freezing cold, but that's a different review.

I'd be interested in coming back for brunch, though I might not so soon return for dinner. It's a decent place to bring newcomers to Madison, though, especially if you can give them chairs with a view of the Capitol."}
{"text":"I came here last night for dinner with a few friends. Delicious food and drinks! We ordered the cheese curds for an appetizer and the sauce that it came with was amazing! I have had cheese curds before but I love the way that they make them here. Our waitress made great suggestions for drinks as well! I absolutely loved the tempest cocktail. I had a cheeseburger and fries for dinner which I also enjoyed. I would definitely return here if I was in the area. The service and food were outstanding."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful date night while I was in town for work... so much so that we're still talking about how nice of a dinner we had at Graze.  The space and decor is open and modern, which always catches my attention.  Service was friendly, but seemed a bit disorganized at times. 

We loved the fried cheese curds, and really appreciated that you could place half of an order instead of a basket of it! The cheese and charcuterie boards were just okay, as was the pate de champagne... We've definitely had better charcuterie boards in California.  

We also ordered a salad and the Graze burger to share. The Graze burger was deliciously decadent but not worth $21; however, the French fries that came with the burger were AMAZING! I can't stop thinking about the French fries! 

Lastly, we were a little nervous about bringing our 11 week baby with us especially knowing Yelp considers this not friendly for kids. But we did not feel put off and felt the Graze team was very friendly and accommodating with our car seat/stroller for the baby. 

Overall, we enjoyed our experience at Graze and would certainly come back the next time I'm back in Madison for work!"}
{"text":"Graze is my favorite local gastropub. It's a great place to take just about anyone--they have dressed-up and dressed-down options, and they can adjust their menu to accommodate everything from veganism to gluten intolerance. Plus, half the dinner menu changes every month or two, so you can go back repeatedly and not see the same things. The other half of the dinner menu stays put, so you have some go-tos if you aren't into options accompanied by root vegetable puree. It can get a little pricey, but there are also cheaper options, so it works out. 

Some of my favorites include the Graze burger and the bibimbap (a spicy Korean dish that's basically meat or tofu + veggies + rice), both of which are on the perennial menu. For appetizers, you can't beat the cheese curds, but the deviled eggs and popcorn sure try. And for dessert, treat yourself to some milk and cookies. They take a bit because they fresh bake them, and they're worth every minute of the wait. 

Besides dinner, Graze has a decadent brunch menu (Nutella French toast, anyone?) and an inventive drinks menu that changes often. They also locally source everything they can."}
{"text":"My wife and I made a jaunt up to Madison, and spent a significant part of Saturday at the Allen Centennial Garden, which I can't recommend highly enough.  They have an edible section of the garden, and also an herb garden, and there was a little sign directing people to \"Graze\" where the herbs are used in their cocktails. Sold!

Actually, the \"10 Babcock Drive\" wasn't that good of a cocktail. It talked a big game about the herb infusions and an herb-tincture, so I was expecting to be blown away by a garden-fresh experience.  There was some aroma, but the overwhelming taste was lemon juice; I think they could do better on this one-- I know I could.

We \"grazed\" our way through various appetizers including the pork buns, beet salad, and deviled eggs. Portions were on the small side, but tasty. 

So why 4 stars? Well, partly it was the ambience (extremely high ceilings, surprisingly cosmopolitan decor-- plus, feel under the seats for foam that helps keep the din to a dull roar), partly it was the company of my lovely wife, and maybe some of my satisfaction was sunstroke-based (I should have worn a hat at the garden), but actually I've got two words for you: pickle board. Somewhere recently, maybe Lucky Peach, I was reading about the rise in sort of \"vegetarian charcuterie\". I scoffed, because to me charcuterie means meat, and it's sacrilegious to say otherwise, but some of those photos looked pretty fun, I *do* like pickled daikon, and I've found lately with charcuterie boards that I can have some vicious heartburn afterwards, so I figured I'd best keep an open mind.

After having had several fairly small plates, we were pleasantly surprised to find ample portions of each of the half-dozen pickled vegetables.  All were uniquely tasty, with different levels and different types of brine.  My wife declared that she was full after a couple nibbles from each plate, but then couldn't stop picking up her chopsticks to get more. Highlights of the board included the earthy and spicy kim-chee, and the pickled ramps, which were crisp, sweet, and tangy. My wife finished those off.

It was a little pricey, but we had a great time, and I'd definitely go back.  Maybe next time we'll take a stab at the $21, Rachel Ray approved, burger ..."}
{"text":"To quote the prolific film \"10 Things I Hate About You\", when asked \"I know you can be overwhelmed, and you can be underwhelmed, but can you ever just be whelmed?\" the answer was \"I think you can in Europe!\"  Well folks, Europe and Graze.  Whelmed is the perfect word to describe my visit to Graze.

The space is beautiful, and the atmosphere elevates my score.  Its wall to wall windows make people viewing easy and fun.  I would come back here for this reason alone!  However, my excitement about this place ends there.  Apps were okay at best, no one in my party of 4 really cared for their meals and the size of the menu left something to be desired.  After ordering we all had the \"maybe I just ordered the wrong thing?\" thought, but realized it wasn't just us.  I wish I could describe it better, but the food was just a little try hard."}
{"text":"My friends seem to love this place, but I just don't get it. Tried it twice and I was never impressed."}
{"text":"Had my first dinner at Graze last night.  I ordered the Rainbow Trout and my date had the Mac & Cheese with Pulled Pork.  While my fish was delicious, the portion was very small and it didn't do much to fill me up.  I did not feel like it was worth 18$.  In contrast, the mac & cheese was insanely good and was much more hefty.  The cheese (Hook's) was great, and the pulled pork/bread crumbs were a perfect compliment.  The next time I have dinner at Graze I'm definitely going with the mac and cheese.

The drinks were fantastic.  We started with some hot seasonal punch, followed up by a glass of their 'on-tap' Syrah, and then a flight of their mead.  The service was excellent as well.  My only complaint would be that the restaurant is fairly small, so some of the tables are placed fairly close together.  As a result, I found myself being forced to listen to the conversation of the table next to me.  This became less and less annoying as alcohol consumption continued."}
{"text":"Wow! This was a recommended joint and boy I was happy that I gave it a try. Outstanding service and food with a creative flare in both their drinks and entrees. 

While it may be a bit pricier than other restaurants in the area, you get what you pay for. 

I highly recommend going in hungry since you will need to try their cheese curds for an app and their chocolate chip cookies for dessert"}
{"text":"What a great meal. At first the menu seems a little odd. But soon I found two appetizers that looked good: the beets and goat cheese salad and the baked butternut squash. But the best was the rainbow trout with celery and green apple and some root vegetable purer. My husband lived the warm spiced white wine which was lively. The warm cranberry tart  ala mode was delicious too!"}
{"text":"Graze had always been good about dogs. Yesterday, we were seated, with dogs, at the edge of the patio (dogs were actually off the patio). We were approached by a manager who stated that they recently changed their policy due to \"staff with allergies\" and \"risks\". Bummer guys. Lots of other spots (DLUX, Merchant, etc) still totally okay with dogs outside. 

Scratch this one off the list of Madison's dog friendly establishments."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the beer. But seriously, the cheese curds and heirloom tomato salad were good but the entrees were terrible. The lamb was disgusting and the market price steak was a 6 oz. cut of Bavettes with terrible potatoes and greens for $30. C'mon chef Tony I was expecting a lot better."}
{"text":"I ordered burger with soup, they were great.
I like the atmosphere in the restaurant with beautiful view of capitol.
I enjoyed having lunch here."}
{"text":"Real good food.

Started with the deviled eggs. Little too much mustard for my liking, but deviled eggs are a personal thing.

Me and two friends orders the burger (dairy free) on cibatta bread, fish and chips (a Friday special) that were amazing, and the chicken and waffles... damn good.

Great prices for the quality of food."}
{"text":"It's a tale of very good, good and ugly for me. So wanted to love it but alas only a three. 
Very good as many on Yelp have suggested was the Korean bowl with pork. Just enough spice to satisfy without overwhelming. Thoroughly enjoyed (5 for this one). 
Very good was the selection of cheese and the two that we selected. Perfect and delicious. 
Good was the deviled eggs. Had a nice siracci mayo. We both enjoyed this!
Now unfortunately the bad. Heard great things about the burgers. Ordered one and it was RAW. Now the waitress never asked how we wanted it but RAW?  Standard is medium. Picky folks like my wife is medium well but ground meat is chock full of bacteria. When you grind meat the outsides and insides mix so simply searing the newly formed outside doesn't kill the former outside that's now in. Epic fail for high end place. Asked waitress to cook more and all she said was \"how do you want it cooked\" and not so sorry to serve you raw ground beef. Kinda bummed me out. Wanted to give a four star but if I get ill tonight may downgrade to two."}
{"text":"Six words: Ambiance Abound and Close to Downtown

In addition to their fantastic space, they have very tasty, vegetarian friendly dishes. A menu of deviled eggs, grilled cheeses and beat burgers sounds like the recipe for a direct passage to Hell. Yet their wine and beer selection will make you feel like you are still in Heaven. At least for a little while."}
{"text":"Graze is my favorite spot in Madison. The floor-to-ceiling windows give a gorgeous view of the Capitol Square, and the interior decor is lovely. The service staff is polite and well-versed in the menu options. But enough about the ambiance. The food is why we're all here.

The FOOD. It is so good. I had the bibimbap - it is a must-have when you come here. It is hearty and filling - just delightful.

The fries are delicious. Their burgers are great. The beer selection is fantastic. 

As a former-Wisconsinite, I'm partial to Madison. Every time I visit the state, Madison is my first stop, and Graze is my first choice for dining."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise! After rethinking our reservation to l'etoile next door (fancy French restaurant next door) because we wanted something more low key, we wandered into graze and could not have been happier. First off, their drink menu is full of interesting and unique drinks made with seasonal ingredients. Second, all their food showcases the freshness of the local farms that Graze sources it's ingredients from. Every bite we had was delicious starting with the mixed greens salad (a yelper favorite), to the pickled veggies plate to the smash burger and ratatouille. We capped things off with the blueberry pie and buttermilk ice cream.

One of the best meals I've had in a long time! Just wish they had this restaurant in Chicago where we live."}
{"text":"While Graze tends to have some overpriced and inconsistent dishes, it is a beautiful brunch spot and has some really delicious options, if you order correctly. 

Try the Magic Coffee. It will not disappoint. Perfect on a hot day after the Farmer's Market.

Also, their cheese curds are one of my favorites in Madison. Get them!

Other than that, they have a yummy Belgian Waffle with DC cherries, if you see it in-season on the menu.

In general, Graze can sometimes miss the mark on its more explorative and imaginative dishes, so it takes a couple visits to figure out what's good. But once you do, it's a really lovely place to take the family for brunch or lunch."}
{"text":"Very very nice setting. Pastries in the morning are fantastic. 

However, recently I went later in the evening I saw that there are problems. First, the menu is interesting, but a little odd. It's good to experiment and explore, but in this case, the menu is more bizarre than tempting. 

But the real problem was the service. It was beyond poor -- it was incompetent. Our waiter took our order (and got confused with some simple substitutions we asked about) and brought one of us a little sample of one of the beers we were curious about. Then he disappeared. No follow-up on the beer -- which we wanted to order -- no \"is everything all right?\" Finally, some other waitress brought the food, and we asked *her* to bring the beer. She was cheerful, and approved of our choice. But we never saw her, or the beer, either. Finally, in exasperation, we flagged someone down and ordered the beer *again*, and this time we got it (far into our meal). And then we were abandoned again. We finished, and wanted to pay. And waited, and looked, and waited. And again, we had to flag some other waiter down in order to pay. The whole experience was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I come to Graze on the reg. There are always new things to try inspired by different cuisines. This is a Tory Miller kitchen, so the flavors are always on point."}
{"text":"It's everything everyone says about it, and it's a shame it's taken this long for me to try it, but I'm glad I did. In fact, It's so good I'm making Graze my first review after a long stint on the disabled list with stomach problems -- a nightmare for a wannabe foodie like me. 

The beer and drink lists are so vast, you could spend your entire 45-minute wait for a table just deciding what to have; I had an old fashioned well made enough to rival those of Graze's eponymous down-the-block neighbor. 

The menu was less vast, but everything looked so good it took just as long to decide. A pretzel seems so simple, but makes for an incredible appetizer when surrounded by Graze's house made dipping sauces. For dinner, I went for the Graze burger; I've been dreaming about it nightly ever since. 

Enjoy the view, the attractive crowd, the drinks, the apps, the everything. Don't wait as long as I did to come here. Just go."}
{"text":"I have yet to be disappointed by this place and it is always one of the first places that I bring guests when they visit Madison. The full walls of windows makes this place light up during the day and gives you a beautiful view of the Capitol square that makes the whole ambiance of this restaurant quite wonderful. There is quite a bit of seating, but it is spread out enough that it actually feels very spacious with open windows. Additionally, the bar that is the central point of the restaurant is a great addition that makes fantastic drinks year round. I highly recommend having any of the cocktails and definitely the seasonal punch that no matter what season it is, it has never disappointed. 

I have had numerous things on the menu from appetizers to entrees and have yet to find something I didn't like. Although a weird item for a Wisconsin menu, the Bibmbap is a must-have that is packed full of flavor in every bite. You have an option of adding in pork or tofu to it and either way you go you can't go wrong. I have been avidly against tofu for a long time because I often find that it has little flavor and a weird texture, but this tofu is flavored in a spicy sauce that makes it a delicious addition of protein to this meal. They also have a rotating market menu that always has a wide selection of dinner entrees that consistently make deciding on a meal difficult because they are all so enticing. Honestly, in terms of appetizers, you can't go wrong with cheese curds in Wisconsin, but the spinach and artichoke dip accompanied by toasted crostini is a wonderful starter that is perfectly creamy without being too heavy. All in all this is a great spot in Madison that shouldn't be overlooked."}
{"text":"we checked graze out a few weeks ago for a change of pace for brunch. we were seated immediately. our server was really pleasant and attentive. the decor is really cool... lofty and modern but somehow very cozy.

we started with bloodies, of course... and they were a little odd. there is a smoky flavor to the mix which i didn't love (but it didn't stop me from having two).

we each ordered something different. I had the breakfast sandwich with brick cheese, which was good and everything I expected. my boyfriend had the chicken fried steak. (he liked it but he was a bit disappointed with the portion size... I kept reminding him that we weren't at the old fashioned.) my sister-in-law had the croque madame, and, with some prodding, my brother ordered the chicken and waffles. I tried a bite of these dishes and liked both. the chicken and waffles was pretty amazing and I will definitely order this dish next time. 

as if we weren't already stuffed, we shared a chocolate croissant and some coffee cake after our meal. both were good but not amazing. 

all in all, this is a solid place for brunch and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Superior dining, Superior service, Superior ambience and view of the Capital.  Local ingredients and an award winning chef!! Drinks outstanding! Viist, Eat! Enjoy!!  Favorite place in Madison!!!"}
{"text":"Came here with two friends spontaneously after visiting the farmer's market today, about 1 pm. It was busy with the end of the farmer's market brunch rush, so we sat at the bar to get a drink and wait for a table. We ended up just ordering and eating there, too. The bartender was very friendly and helpful. Loved the Bloody Mary and the cheese curds. The Eggs Benedict was pretty good. All in all, I felt like the drinks were the highlight of our visit. The atmosphere was wonderful and modern, very nice but not pretentious. I'd visit again, and look forward to trying more drinks, but would lean more toward lunch/dinner options rather than breakfast. Still thinking about those cheese curds though :)"}
{"text":"Honestly, I'm not really sure what all the hype is about. I will say, the location is great, and the servers I've encountered have been nothing but friendly and attentive. 

However, the food just isn't that great. First of all, I wish they had more pork-free options on the menu that weren't vegetarian. The first time at Graze, I went with my mom, brother, and sister and we ordered a selection of stuff to share: cheese curds (good, though I slightly prefer those at dlux or merchant), cheese plate (again, decent, but nothing special) and a bibimbap bowl (I guess it was good, I'm a supertaster, so I sometimes like my food a little more bland than most people, but this wasn't even flavorful to me). On the plus side, their lemonade is always delicious. 

All in all, it's pretty mediocre and doesn't live up to its image. I probably won't be back any time soon."}
{"text":"I'm still not impressed by this place. The atmosphere is great and the drinks are strong but the food is just ok :-/ * the drinks are strong at most bars/restaurants in Madison :-)

Pickle board- ok

Pub Burger- almost not edible because it was over cooked....like eating cardboard :-(

Hickory Nut Bourbon-Caramel Pie- absolutely delicious. It's very similar to pecan pie, my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review and knocking off one star.  My wife and I went to Graze last Saturday night after a hiatus of six months or so, and I was somewhat disappointed.  We called around eight o'clock and asked about the wait and we were told it would be an hour.  I tried to give my name, but they said that I would have to come in to the restaurant.  That was annoying.

We got there about an hour later and were told it would be a forty-five minute wait.  When we were seated, I'm pretty sure we got the worst table in the restaurant-- people bumped into me throughout the meal.  The service was fine, but I wasn't too thrilled to see that the prices had been raised by a few dollars.  You know what's more ridiculous than paying almost $20 for a burger?  Paying over $20 for a burger.

The real kicker was the end of our meal.  After waiting for forty-five minutes and spending over $100, they switched the lights on 15 minutes before closing to let us know to get the hell out.  That was incredibly obnoxious."}
{"text":"I have a huge crush on Graze and I'm not even sure where to start. The gorgeous capital-view glass-encased atmosphere? The incredible fresh local ingredients? The Korean-inspired flare? For now I'll say it's the lavender lemonade because HOLY mother of all things tangy this stuff is amazing. Graze has never disappointed."}
{"text":"PROS: Interesting local-fusion concept, cute interior, decent prices and portions
CONS: ?

Funny walking in, ordering the vegetarian bibimbap, and observing that all the fancily-dressed women from different tables ordered exactly the same thing! BBB IS IN! This spot is hip, cute, packed with a lot of young urbanites and...slightly yuppy?

I thoroughly enjoyed the chef's choice cheese platter appetizer that we ordered, as well as my non-classic Graze-ian bibimbap, which had little crispy cubes of rice -- rather interesting and innovative take on achieving the clay-pot crispy rice feel of traditional Korean bibimbap. I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner. The restaurant has an amazing selection of local produce. The cheese platter as a starter is great and there is a good set to select from. They have a good selection of fish and meat to choose from for the main dishes. Had the \"burger\" with fries. The burger has tasty and cooked to specification. The fries were OK but nothing special. They have a great selection of Wisconsin beer. Overall a great meal and I am certainly coming back to try more of their food."}
{"text":"Good food, although slightly pricey for what I got.  Ordered the Impossible burger, as Graze is one of the only 2 places in Madison that offers it.  The burger was the Impossible patty with the Double Cheese Smash Burger topping.  It was good, although the patty was a little flat/smushed, but I'm not sure if that was a result of the burger itself or preparation.  The taste was good but combined with the thin patty and the toppings of the pickles and burger sauce I felt like I was eating a $16 Big Mac.  I think the fries were slightly overdone as well.  It was a solid meal with no glaring errors, but it ended up being pretty pricey with the patty substitution.  However, our waitress was very accommodating and the view of the Captiol building made for a quite nice ambience.  Hopefully I'll be back to try other dishes!"}
{"text":"Well, what a delightful brunch spot! We stopped in on a whim while driving through Madison this morning. There were plenty of open tables, which was crazy; this place in Chicago would have a constant hour wait. The space is bright and open, all windows and super high ceilings. I got Nutella-stuffed French toast that was super tasty without being too sweet or too filling. The house lemonade of the day was strawberry rhubarb and it was delicious. I saw that they have a nice selection of local cheeses, meats, and a couple of oysters. They also have wine on tap. I loved that the entire back of the menu was a list of the farms they work with. All in all, just a wonderful birthday brunch. Come to Chicago, OK?"}
{"text":"Forgot my poached egg in the noodle bowl for brunch. Luckily I am a forgiving person. Everything else was delicious. My partner in crime had the eggs Benny and ate that shit like no tomorrow. *hi five, graze*"}
{"text":"I'm town visiting Wisco with my family!   Easy walk from the Hampton Downtown Inn.  Great atmosphere and view of the Capitol.  Our family was able to taste all of the top dishes.  We had Mac N Cheese with pulled pork for a starter along with a warm hot pretzel. Then, we had fish n chips (haddock) for Good Friday (yes Easter Weekend), Graze Burger, Fish Stew, Bibimbap and Pork Tenderloin.  You think we were finished?   Traveling from SoCal, we dived into their apple pie and cookies and milk.  Ok, now for my take and reviews...great service!  We left very full.  The fish n chips was fried nicely with beer battered.   The Bibimbap has a nice kick. Loved the Graze Burger.  The Pork T was ok.  My kids loved the MNC.  And to finish on a high note - the mile and cookies were the best!  Next time, I would pass on the Apple Pie.  And if one of my kids attends college here, I would come back and do the pork buns and cheese curds.  We highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One of our \"go-to's\" while in Madison. Both the view and food are hard to beat. Located in a glass-sided building on the square so at most of the tables you have the Capital building as a backdrop. It's especially pretty at night. 

Graze is a locally-sourced restaurant meaning that the food is local and the farm/cheese maker, etc. is known by the diner. The menu is small but we have never been disappointed by the selection. We only stop once a year while in town and have noticed that the menu does change but some of our favorites are still available (Kimshi Deviled Eggs). We always start with a cheese plate which you select from a list of 12 various local styles/flavors and is served with toast wedges and preserves. Your server can help with your selection.

The food is seriously good. Both the entrees and starters are unique to Graze and are perfectly prepared. The flavors and textures of whatever we have ordered are complex and seasoned just right. The prices are up there but I don't mind paying for food of this quality. Portion size is just right. From past experience the desserts are awesome but you may not have room if you enjoyed an appetizer. Very good coffee.

Service has always been good but on our last visit not quite as personal. Food delivery is timely. The beer selection isn't great but you're coming here for the food and I'm sure you will agree to something they have.

My only issue this past visit and much of what's keeping my rating from perfect is the lighting. It may have been just our table which was located right next to the window but it was so dark that I had a difficult time seeing my meal and it took away some of my enjoyment of dining. While romantic and offering a better view of the Capital we needed an additional candle. Otherwise the ambience is modern and clean, focusing on the dining experience and not the trappings of what's hanging on the wall.

I wish I could give 4.5 stars as we love this place and will keep coming back. This is one of many nice places to eat downtown but the combination of quality of food and the Capital backdrop is what does it for us."}
{"text":"Their Bibimbap is phenomenal...I've never had any better!  Crispy, fried rice cake, kimchi, carrots and other assorted veggies with egg and spiced meat...it truly doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"Great space, food and service from the wait staff was good, but one of the bartender who worked last night is snooty and rude. Not sure I will be spending my $ there anymore."}
{"text":"In town over the weekend looking for a good casual dinner with fresh ingredients. We started with cheese curds because when I'm WI ;-) had the Peterson steak with sweet potato hash. Very good. The fired chicken was also good, but we wish we would've gone for the burger instead. All in all a very good dining experience in terms of the environment, service and food."}
{"text":"Graze is a great restaurant to bring friends, family, coworkers, etc. Milkshakes and burgers are amazing, huge fan of their seasonal berry dish. Can't complain about the bottomless mimosas either :) Definitely a must-go to spot in Madison."}
{"text":"Went to groomsmen brunch here the day of the wedding and have to say I was impressed. I was extremely hungover for the night before and the Bloody Mary gave me life. it even came with a cheese curd which, when in Wisconsin ya know? love that you dont have to ask for a beer chaser, it came with it! 

I ordered the carne asada hash. it was delicious but i was expecting a larger portion size. nonetheless, amazing. 

We came in right at opening and got pretty good service, the drinks and food initally took a little longer than expected to come out. Thats probably my only complaint but overall amazing spot, right across from.the Capitol. definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"A group of 18 of us in Madison for my parents 60th wedding anniversary descended on Graze one Saturday at 5:05pm, just after opening.  They don't take reservations and I had called a few weeks earlier and they said they get pretty busy after 5:30 or 6pm and we should show up right at opening or face a possibly long wait.  There were already a number of tables seated when we showed up but the hostess was very helpful in getting our group of \"cats\" seated at 3 adjacent tables.  I think over half of our group got the Graze burger.  The bibimbap was also quite popular (three or four vegetarians). It was a beautiful afternoon, we were in a good mood and the service and ambience were fast and delightful.  Our table got the charcuterie platter with cheeses and meats.  Incredibly tasty but the portions were disappointingly small.  Everyone who had the bibimbap was very happy and agreed it was a sizable portion.  A consensus developed that the Graze burger had a combination of yummy fat mouthfeel and sweetness from the caramelized onions that needed balancing.  We didn't agree whether that should be a good blue cheese, sharp cheddar, Dijon mustard or jalapeños.  If I'm running the restaurant I'd put these as optional items on the signature Graze burger.  Over half our group didn't order alcohol; the bill with mandatory tip was just under $40 per person."}
{"text":"I recently was at Graze with a friend that is new to Madison. She's gluten free and vegetarian, and wow, did the staff pull out all the stops to help her find something that would meet both her dietary needs. They actually took the time to talk through preparations with her and offered to bring any questions to the chef if needed. That, my friends, is quality service. 

The bibimbap and aged cocktail I had weren't too bad either and the atmosphere was great. It's always fun to dine below those floor to ceiling windows with the capitol illuminated in the background."}
{"text":"I was here when I was celebrating a birthday. We ordered a delicious aged mac and cheese with panko breadcrumbs. Absolutely delicious. Great atmosphere. Open concept, glass tables, and superb lighting."}
{"text":"I've been in here many times since moving to Madison and it is probably my favorite spots to stop in for a late night burger and a beer.  They always have great beers on tap and their pub burger is served on an English muffin.. It's good.  They also have a buy one, get one happy hour that starts after 9pm on tapped beers.  Tough to beat that.  The bartenders I've had have always been friendly as well."}
{"text":"A great upscale restaurant in the heart of Madison! Our experience started when we were seated but a little cold due to the location of our table. We asked to be seated elsewhere and were promptly moved with a smile. Excellent service!

The first thing that struck me was how knowledgeable the waiter was on the food. He was able to describe every single dish beautifully, and it just made me hungrier and hungrier!

The boyfriend and I ordered plenty. The cheese curds were phenomenal with a side of buttermilk ranch. The pork belly buns were delicious. The french fries, especially the garlic aioli, were something from heaven. To end, my double smash burger was an absolute delight. So cheesy, and cooked perfectly although well done isn't my usual preference.

The other dishes we ordered, however, were not amazing. The Mac n cheese was ok, tasted a little sour, and the deviled eggs were nothing to write home about. Most disappointing was the graze burger my boyfriend ordered. The burger was sweet and didn't seem to match with all the conflicting flavors inside of it. It was almost like biting into a sweet reduction that was seasoned with the purpose of being savory and salty. Definitely not my favorite.

However, my whole experience was amazing, and I'll be sure to come back!"}
{"text":"Coming from Toronto, I was clueless as to what gastronomical pleasures I would find in Madison. Graze was simply marvellous. The food was exquisite, fresh and portioned perfectly. The service was personable and attentive. The atmosphere was modern, simple and inviting. These are the types of gems I like to find when I travel. Highly recommend it to everyone who appreciates a quality food experience."}
{"text":"The tofu scramble was really, really good. Don't think it's going to be an actual scramble in any way. The tofu is merely folded into the sauce. But oh! that is a delicious sauce. I understand it changes seasonally, and were I closer, I'd get it every time it changed because I'm sure it'd be fantastic every time. The perfect dish to split after the cheese-fest that is the farmer's market across the way."}
{"text":"One of my favorite atmospheres in Madison, and in my opinion, the best cheese curds. Entrees can be hit or miss, so I usually like to go for a glass of wine & an appetizer. Pork buns are another must!"}
{"text":"What can I say? I love this place. Such a bright and airy location. Fabulous view of the capital. The breakfast and brunch cocktails are superb. All of the breakfast items are delicious and well plated."}
{"text":"Graze is consistently one of the best places to get a meal in Madison. I've never had a bad meal here. They could stand to have a few more vegetarian options, but the ones they do have are all excellent. Whenever someone new to Madison asks me where to eat, Graze is always my first recommendation."}
{"text":"Always delicious and interesting. Great cocktails too. The cheesy polenta was miracle food."}
{"text":"I need to come here to eat but we came for the later happy hour that was from 9-11! I was excited to hear about this reverse happy hour because all beers were buy one get one. I was in the mood for a ginger beer cocktail and opted for the Open Sesame which included - Pimm's, Graze cucumber and ginger shochu, Canton, lime, ginger beer. The drink cost about $12 which was a little pricey but delicous! I will return to get food!"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately for brunch by a dour host, but then quickly greeted by our seemingly-friendly waiter. We ordered uncomplicated meals i.e. eggs and toast. The appetizer and kid's meal arrived quickly, then things fell off the cliff. Twenty-five minutes after the appetizer arrived, our waiter never returned and was clearly avoiding eye contact. We ran out of water and had finished our salty cheese curds (which were really good). My husband finally located a pitcher of water. Our waiter watched him refill our glasses, yet continued to avoid us. After 40 mins, we finally flagged him down to enquire about the rest of our meals. He got quite defensive at our innocent, polite inquiry and waiter-splained to us that there is a space between appetizers and the meal (40 mins?!). Our meals arrived a few mins later and had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp. The eggs and toast were sub-par (below a Perkins standard) and served with a flavorless, dry, hockey puck of a hash brown/potato patty (hard to even call it a hash brown, really). My husband ordered chilaquiles and said they were at least good, but not really anything special or worth the 45 min wait. My son's mac and cheese was also good. I found it odd that kids' meals come with fries or mixed greens (do many four year olds eat mixed greens) but adult meals have the option of fresh fruit. I can't see any reason we would return given many better choices in the area. It's also telling that other restaurants had a wait at the same time and this restaurant did not; we should have taken that as a sign."}
{"text":"I loved their cheese curds. Served with their buttermilk aioli.

Deviled eggs were so good that i noted down all the ingredients to recreate it myself 

Shrimp salad was lackluster.

Service was really good - I sat at the bar"}
{"text":"Love love love this restaurant and location! I've only been a handful of times but each time, I'm always impressed with the food and the service. The ambiance is amazing and I love the ever changing menu and the list of where the food comes from! Its a rarity these days to actually know where your food has come from and its fun to see the list of farmers and growers Graze buys food from. I recommend Graze to my friends and will continue to go."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had in Madison!  I went to school there so coming back 5 years later I went to some old favorites but decided to try somewhere new as well and was very impressed with it here. To start I had the seasonal punch which was peach flavored and absolutely delicious. My boyfriend and I split the graze burger and the mac and cheese with pulled pork, both of which were stellar! The atmosphere of the place and the view of the Capitol wasn't too shabby either!  Will definitely be making this place a must-go next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I've ate at most of Madison's non-chain restaurants and this place is by far one of my favorites. Incredible atmosphere and right across from the capital with walking distance from many bars and theaters. The menu is very local yet has very diverse and unique entrees! Might be a bit of a wait to get seated but worth it!"}
{"text":"It definitely is living by it's name (or I am not fancy enough.) We went for breakfast. The french toast was delicious but tiny. My spouse had a burger. He said it was good but the fries don't live up to what others have said. They are just fries. I did like the cheese curds, mostly the size of them. They are not too flavorful. If you like delicious cheese curds head to the old fashioned. We ran out of water and it wasn't replenished but we lived."}
{"text":"This is a decent place with local food, which was nice. I went for brunch and had the Eggs Benedict. It was tasty, but not amazing. My husband got a burger and salad. The food tasted fresh, the atmosphere was nice, and the service was fine. I was expecting more of a unique twist on the dishes though- everything was fairly basic. It was an overall satisfying but underwhelming experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I had our first farm to table experience at Graze and we were very pleased with our service and food thanks to our server Luke S. He was very helpful with the menu. His detailed description of the entrees was amazing! He's very passionate about his job. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I ordered the carne asada hash. Overall it was a good meal, but the eggs were just a bit too funny for my liking. However, my friend ordered the same thing but thought the eggs were fine. The actual carne asada was great - very well seasoned and cooked perfectly. The location was great as well, very open with several windows."}
{"text":"Love this place! It does have a smaller menu, which I actually appreciate. Large menus with a million options can seem overwhelming. I love Graze's dedication to local, sustainable sources of food which keeps me coming back time after time, that, and of course the delicious meals and amazing customer service!"}
{"text":"We went here before the end of 2013 and had a wonderful evening out. We hit up Graze for my significant others birthday and we were very glad with our choice. Having gone out on a Friday night, I knew there would be a wait but I also knew that Graze utilizes a website that will allow you to see where you are on the wait-list. We put our names in, and headed down the corner to grab a beer at a not-soo packed bar while we waited. When we saw that our names were soon on the list, we headed back to Graze. We were seated at one of the front tables that overlook the capital. I had a fantastic drink-I believe it was the \"Keep your gin up\" and the birthday boy had a take on a Moscow mule. I'm not a big meat eater, but I couldn't help but enjoy the bites of the Graze burger that were shared with me. The meat was seared perfectly on the burger and the onions were caramelized to perfection with just the right amount of sweetness to them. I ordered the bibimbap and didn't regret my decision there either. The crispy rice was amazing in contrast to the egg and the spicy sauce that it came with. We had been to Graze in the spring of 2013, and the trip we took at the end of 2013 completely surpassed the first visit in every way possible. The staff was prompt, courteous, and made great recommendations."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday afternoon with my cousin and a friend for a light lunch. The floor to ceiling windows give you a great view of the capitol building and the cocktail list is lovely - we were able to try a few things we've never thought of before! The menu is limited but eclectic; great for small taster plates with few substantial options. 

Our waiter was patient and attentive and the vibe of the place is overall pretty great. 

If you're very hungry I'd save this place for later, but if you want to chill out and try their cheese plate, make a trip. I believe there's also a bakery here (?) or at least affiliated."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. The cheese curds are the best in Madison, and every entree we have ever had has been phenomenal. The graze burger in particular is to die for and is totally worth the $21 price tag. We have never had a poor experience with service, though it usually is a long wait. We have resorted to having a late dinner (~9:30pm) just so that we can go there and walk right up to get a table."}
{"text":"If it were not for the pickles I would give it one star. 

On that note, the pickles are mostly very good, although the kimchi makes one think that the chef has never had kimchi before, as there was no spice to it. Every dish we ordered noticeably lacked boldness where it was called for: kimchi had no spice in it; the escabeche substituted cauliflower in place of the traditional jalapenos;bahn mi also lacked the traditional jalapenos and was made with an incredibly mundane ham, with a meager sprinkling of pickled vegetables. Spicy food makes me tear up but I'm not as scared of it as the chef.  

Both of our entrees had fries on the side, one order was overdone and the other underdone. Both orders of fries became soggy and lost their crispness five minutes out. Perhaps I am just spoiled by the divinity of Opa's fries."}
{"text":"Bibimbap burrito = 10/10. Would come back just to order this again. All ingredients fresh and locally grown. Service was on point. Ambience next to the Capitol was sweet too. Definitely check it out the next time you're in town!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Wisconsin! Tonight was my second visit & it confirmed my love of Graze's great menu.  Our server was thoughtful & attentive. Dinner of mussels was delicious! Everyone had a very nice time..."}
{"text":"The Graze burger is the best burger I've ever had! Everytime I went there I can't resist the burger. It is a nice place to enjoy the view of the capitol while dining."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now for lunch and have been blown away both times.  The first time I had the Pub Burger which was delivered on the homemade english muffin and despite the boring appearance.....I was blown away.  On initial inspection, I was so disappointed and felt doomed that this was going to be another wasted burger experience.........So wrong I was...the burger was cooked to perfection and the combination of flavors was like music in my mouth.  The english muffin brought this unique texture to an otherwise boring bun that would have been in its place.  The meat was cooked perfectly and the cheese melts in just the percent way.  Even the fries on the side were seasoned to my liking and the waitress  got me so hot sauce and ketchup and I was all smiles.

The second time I went I tried the Bibimbop with tofu and asked for it to be spicy......it was AWESOME....the rice was crispy, creating a texture amongst the smooshy egg and other ingredients.  The flavors burst in your mouth and made for an amazing lunch experience.  If you have not had it before....this is a must try.

Overall, the Graze delivers some amazing food....I could care less about the local, organic, or farm to table crap if the food is not good.  When the food is as amazing as Graze delivers....and on top of that it is locally sourced, it takes it to a whole other level.  This is a must try for any burger lover, and overall a great place to grab lunch.  I plan to give it a shot for dinner next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Excellent food and an amazing service. We ordered the cheese curds and it was marvelous. The double cheese burger was really good. I ordered fries with the burger and was disappointing, as it didn't taste fresh. Other than that, amazing experience."}
{"text":"I had the bibimbap, and I'll be honest, I really didn't like it. I didn't like that the rice was formed into a cubed and then pan fried. I preferred the traditional method of bibimbap. I also had the sweet potato soup which was, meh, ok-ish I guess. The menu didn't have much in it. Overall I do like the customer service, the cleanliness of the place, and the view right by the capital building."}
{"text":"I came with a party of 3 on a weekday at noon and we were seated right away. I had a coffee, a cheeseburger with bacon and cheddar on sesame brioche, and a side of deep-fried cheese curds. I liked that they offered them as a side, since not everywhere else did (otherwise, I was ready to commit to eating an order of deep-fried cheese curds as lunch). I ordered my burger medium-rare, and I know I probably should have just said rare, but it came more on the medium to well-done side (brown in the middle, not pink). I also wasn't impressed with the sesame brioche bun. If you have ever made brioche, you know how rich and buttery and delicious it is. This was a little dry. Our waiter was very friendly and let me know when ordering that there was some other type of brioche bun available (poppyseed? Something like that). The space was nice and reminded me of Isabel's in Portland."}
{"text":"I went here the first time because I was told it is now the only place one can buy etoile's croissants. Ahh how I miss the only bakery counter. Buying croissants to go there is possible but awkward (and not cheap of course).

I finally went there for dinner a few nights ago with two friends that go there regularly and love it. We had two toddlers with us (we ate very early so it wasn't too crazy yet) and the staff was very gracious about their craziness.

I had the risotto, which was excellent but I still wonder why all nice restaurants feel the need to douse dishes in truffle oil. We also tried the pickles and the banh mi. Both were good but did not knock my socks off. I would happily go again (perhaps some night when I have a babysitter though)"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful and had many vegan options.  

FYI There are two menus- one of which indicating what food can be modified to be Gluten Free, Vegan, Vegetarian, etc."}
{"text":"The food is excellent and so is the service. The restaurant is very chic and you couldn't ask for a better location. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First experience here was during Ironman 2013. Yesterday I completed Ironman 70.3 in this great city. My amazing fiancé & I went here for lunch today. He was there for Sunday brunch while I was sweating it out on the bike portion of the Tri. 

I indulged in a killer Bloody Mary - their homemade mix is not to be missed. Tito's vodka. 

The Hooks grilled cheese was worth the carb & calorie splurge. Mustard grain, local tomatoes & 3 different Hooks cheese. 

What a treat for our last meal before we head back to DC ...where it's a headache a minute there. Thank you Graze."}
{"text":"Vegetarians Beware!  
Went to Graze for dinner and came home hungry because I'd rather not cobble a meal together out of sides.  My husband got the mac and cheese, because he is apparently 11 years old... or because it is the only vegetarian meal option.  It's certainly sized for an 11 year old.  I had a mixed vegetable salad that was approximately four little carrots and a fried hash brown drizzled in oil.  It was infuriating that this paltry excuse for a salad cost more than a companion's beefy burger and fries!

And as far as the ambiance goes: Graze feels nothing like New York or Chicago, as one reviewer wrote.  But then again, I suppose it does have the \"je ne sais quoi\" of the Au Bon Pains at LaGuardia or O'Hare.  It features the same deafening, echoey acoustics, high prices, and food court seating... but at least they have decent vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Cheese Curds are incredible, Service is great, collard greens were delish and the ambiance was open and fresh. Biscuits were dry and Mac'n'cheese was ok (a little too 'American Cheese' tasting)."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Friday night (first mistake). The wait was atrocious. We waited for over an hour and a half (second mistake). I think this is why I don't remember much of my experience. From what I can remember they had bomb cocktails! I do not remember how the food was. I know I got the ever-popular mac n' cheese. I want to say it was just alright since I don't remember - probably meaning: It was just alright. 

Looking at the menu right now and props to Graze for their unique dishes and combinations and of course, all locally grown ingredients."}
{"text":"COST:
$2.50 (Coffee)
$10~ (Bibimbap Burrito)

After walking through a blizzard, literally anything we eat here would've been awesome. The friendliest people I've seen in Madison for sure. I was picking between their bibimbap burrito or breakfast sandwich and I was advised by the server to go for the burrito... and she was god damn right!

It's so surprising to me how a very clearly American looking place has such a fantastic brunch special. It was so delicious I wish had gone back for it. The flavors were exotic and the small side of kimchi was amazing. There was some special spicy sauce that came with it. It definitely had some kick to it and was on the sweet side as well, just perfect.

Last but not the least, let's talk about the coffee. They brewed and served Kickapoo Coffee's Winter Solstice which I'm still trying to find and buy online. It's the most delicious coffee I've ever had with hints of chocolate and caramel. It was awesome!

I look forward to a Madison return trip over the summer and I'll roll through Graze again."}
{"text":"I will go back for the bone marrow alone. I like me some animal parts, especially when it's prepared so well. Overall, has the prices and ambience of a big city gastropub, which can be nice for a quick dinner date before a show. The food was excellent though. As long as they don't hire a chef who screws it all up, they'll definitely be getting more of my money in the future."}
{"text":"We were combing through reviews and suggestions on where to have Sunday Brunch in Madison. We finally decided to give Graze a go because someone in our party was familiar with Chef Tory. We were seated immediately by a pleasant hostess. It was a relatively small specialized menu (which makes sense for the type of place it was). One of guests had a few restrictions, which did make it a bit hard. The staff didn't really seem to want to work with her on that. We found that a bit surprising. We ordered the fried cheese curds, the french toast sticks, beet salad, beet veggie burger, and bacon & eggs. The cheese curds were absolutely delicious and perfectly prepared. The french toast sticks were really disappointing. We expected something moist and tasty, instead were met with dry, bland, expensive for what they were (3 sticks). I would not recommend anyone get them, perhaps opt for the sticky bun. The veggie burger was good, but I was surprised they used American cheese to top it off. It really cheapens the whole thing. The bacon was severely undercooked, I was shocked. In the restaurant's defense, the person who ordered it didn't want to send it back, so they didn't have a chance to rectify it. The beet salad was good, albeit expensive again for the size. I feel like a goat cheese would've complemented it better than the Greek yogurt, but it's not my restaurant. We weren't overly impressed with the server, which kind of rounds out this whole experience with two stars. Maybe I'd consider it a three, but not sure I'd be going back anytime soon to try again. Oh, the view with the large windows and capitol right behind it make for an awesome ambiance!"}
{"text":"Vodka battered cheese curds are a must try. And maybe you want to compare who's got better cheese curds in town. The pork buns are great. Beet burger is delicious. Biscuits and gravy for brunch is my fave. It's a big portion so you can share with four ppl. Waffles and pancakes are hard to miss. Chicken and waffle was okay. The burgers they offer are delicious. It's great knowing the food you eat is made from local ingredients."}
{"text":"ok... I have been here 4 times now. So I feel I can write an honest review. 

Atmosphere- cool
Menu concept- cool
Menu execution- blah.
Service- BAD 

The restaurant industry is all about consistency... graze lacks this quality!  It was good the first time, but after that it has been bad. Most of all (like other reviewers) the service is sub par. Good thing you are on the square otherwise I don't think you would be around much longer."}
{"text":"I was introduced to Graze through their Magic Coffee that they sell during the summer at the farmer's market. I was hooked when i went in for drinks and dinner with a friend. I love the idea of locally-sourced food and it was delicious! Their cocktail menu is also wonderful and the view of the Capital building can't be beat."}
{"text":"I went here on a sunny spring day with my wife for lunch.  It has a cool modern atmosphere with direct views of the capitol from almost any seat.  The burger I had was good, but very messy.  I think the bun could have been slightly bigger.  I like the huge ceilings inside.  Overall a good option on the square that I will try again.  I think happy hour here could be a good idea especially with summer on the way and their big tap beer selection."}
{"text":"I don't quite get the hype around this place. Whenever someone comes from out of town, I feel like this is the place that gets recommended the most. If you come on a Friday or Saturday, the wait usually hovers around an hour or so depending on the size of your group. I've had multiple dishes on both their dinner and brunch menus and while they do use fresh local ingredients, the actual entrees are a mixed bag. The burger is probably the most disappointing entree on their menu as it comes out a lot smaller than you expect it to be and is not always cooked to the doneness that you asked for. I feel pretty similarly about their steak entree but it seems like they've taken it off their menu. I do like their chicken and waffles for brunch, particularly because it comes with the thinner American waffle which I always enjoy more than the standard Belgian waffle. I also maintain that their vodka battered cheese curds are the best I've had in Madison, though the portion size has been steadily shrinking over the past few years. I may stop in for a cheese curd fix from time to time but I won't be coming back for a full meal anytime soon."}
{"text":"My wife had the Eggs Benedict, which not only looks superb, but she said it was excellent.
My Bacon Cheeseburger was great and presentation was spot on.  It was cooked perfectly.
We also ordered the Artisan Cheese tray with cherry compote, which was exceptional, but very small.
My wife ordered a Chai and stated it was really good, but it was around $4 for a small Chai, so she thought it was overpriced.
I'd give Graze 4 Stars, but it is a bit overpriced for the area and our waitress was abysmal.  She only came to the table three times total and we didn't feel important.  Great presentation, horrible service."}
{"text":"Great service, sat at bar and had beer went to order beet and walnut burger and was told that's only available for lunch very disappointed!! Had the veggie burger was ok, the English muffin made it very dry, better if was on another kind of bread."}
{"text":"It seems that there is a constellation of very, very good restaurants surrounding the Capitol.  One in that constellation is Graze.

We visited early evening, nearly opening the place.  The setting is open, airy, convivial, relaxed, effervescent.  

The service was attentive, our server very knowledgeable about preparations and willing to step up and make actual recommendations.

Our meal included Roasted Fall Squash, Artesian (a local farm) Trout, a burger and an apple crisp.

The Roasted Fall Squash came with goat cheese.  It almost seemed designed by some 'foodologist', offering and exploring subtle complimentary tastes.  Fresh, seasonal.

The Roasted Artesian Trout came with celery root purée, delicata squash, lemon browned butter, and rye croutons.  Generous and a wonderful medley of tastes. 

The burger was good, it being hard to stretch limits on that, but the accompanying fries got my partner's comment of 'best fries ever!'

The menu offers choices for diners with a view of their diet.  For us, that meant seeing gluten free choices.

The apple crisp was made gluten-free at our request.   Very tasty, our waitress explaining for the gluten free it just different components to the crumble, recommending it.  Ice cream was on the side per our request--delicious!

So, out of this world good!  Actually, out of this world great!"}
{"text":"I was at Graze on a Saturday afternoon (off-time, around 4pm) for the cheese curd crawl. I was told that most of the crawl people were simply ordering from the bar, so I did that. I mentioned that I was with a group of 10, and the bartender said that he'd recommend a basket of cheese curds, as it would be enough for everyone to try a curd or two. I ordered and paid (the basket didn't get the crawl discount that the smaller order would have, but that was fine with me at the time). I then waited for 30 minutes, during which time people came, got cheese curds, and left. I went to the bartender again and asked if he had a time estimate, to which he shrugged and said \"I have no idea, soon?\". I then went to a server and asked, and she told me to ask the bartender about it. At this point it had been about 40 minutes since I had ordered. The server talked to the bartender, and the bartender called out to me over the bar and said that it was \"miscommunication because I had moved\". I had moved about 10 feet from where I was initially standing to avoid crowding people eating at the tables at Graze, and I was still making occasional eye contact with the bartender and completely within view of him for the duration of the wait. When we finally got the \"basket\" of cheese curds, it was a large basket with only 7 curds in it. I was not offered an apology or comp for this mess. 

I am extremely disappointed in Graze, which markets itself as an upscale \"experience\". The only \"experience\" I got from Graze was one filled with rude, inconsiderate service. The cheese curds were delicious - but were 7 curds worth ~$8, a 45 minute wait, and being blamed for an employee's lack of attention? I don't think so, and neither do the other members of my group, who will not be returning to a place with such awful service."}
{"text":"Good solid food in a nice atmosphere. Everything is clean.  The food is fresh and delicious. The bar selection is very nice. Good for people watching and a view of the Capital. We have had dinner and brunch here and it is clearly a popular place."}
{"text":"Great upscale dining restaurant in Capitol square! I really loved the decor and service of this place. The staff were extremely courteous and friendly. 

This is actually the first place I ever tried cheese curds at in all of Madison, and I thoroughly enjoyed them! I got the chicken and waffles which was also fantastic! For the price point, it's well worth the meal. 

I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a nicer restaurant within walking distance to State Street or just in the Capitol area!"}
{"text":"I wished the food was better (sigh). 
I also wished that cocktails were better. 

And, those pastries prepared for the Saturday farmer's market .... pretty bad. I used to like then Cafe Soleil pastries, but the apple croissant and chocolate croissant I had recently were just mess. If they haven't figured out already, their competitions are kickin' their butt."}
{"text":"I've been to Graze several times now & seem to have made it a habit to come for special occasions including my own birthday. The view of the capitol building with the floor to ceiling windows makes for a great happy hour spot, not to mention their amazing craft cocktails. I have only sat down to eat one time but when I did - I felt that our server was very attentive & gave us a great experience."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.  The summer drink menu is disappointing and the service last time was lacking.  We went there for happy hour, and found out that we could only use our chip (Buy 1, Get 1 tap beers/wine) before 6 p.m.   It would have been nice if someone would have told us that, esp. since we went there only for happy hour.  This used to be the place to go for us (as a young mod place) with drinks that were $8-12 and well worth it.  After our last trip there, I am not sure we will be back.  Two drinks and an appetizer and our bill was nearly $40.  We are happy to pay that if the service is good and the menu has good selections.  This place is going to go under if they don't fix something."}
{"text":"We were drawn to Graze for how consistently busy it was every time we walked by. Went for Saturday night dinner, no reservation but were able to sit at the bar. Wine list was ok, the beer my bf ordered was average. Started out with cheese curds, yum! As a MN girl that's had a few cheese curds, they were divine. Next, we devoured the Wedge salad. Amazing!! We decided to try the Graze burger and see what all the Rachael Ray hype was about. Now, I love expensive food so a $21 burger was intriguing to me... Well... It was good.. But we had just stopped at Culvers the night before and really enjoyed the butter burger... Is it wrong if we think they are comparable?

 Overall, great experience and would recommend for a fun night out. Skip the Graze burger and order one of the other delicious options, like the Bun which sounded amazing."}
{"text":"For me, the menu is a bit limited but the food always tastes good when I go. I usually get better service from tables than the bar, so I'd head there if I go. Expect to pay a pretty penny, but you'll get good local food and interesting drinks, if you like to drink a bit."}
{"text":"Very nice Sunday brunch. Varied menu. Tasty food.  Adjacent to the Capitol Building.  Not as crowded as some of the other brunch places ( with food just as good)."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Their food is absolutely amazing and out of this world.  I have never been disappointed with a drink or menu item.  They also have a lot of fun 5-course specialty dinners.  The wait can be long at times, but they will call your cell phone when your table is ready.  Brunch is my favorite!  They may have the best Bloody Mary in town!"}
{"text":"In a word, overrated. However, I went during Restaurant Week, so I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt.

The wait was short, thankfully, as it was crowded and uncomfortable both at the bar and entryway. My date and I were seated at a very tiny table, but you can't argue with the view. I could've done without the wait staff frequently bumping into us. And the heat. Summer in Wisconsin gets warm, especially through all glass walls.

The drinks came quickly, thankfully. The waiter seemed quite stressed and worked fast without much sweet talk, but again, Restaurant Week. We placed our orders and were surprised to receive a basket of popcorn - which actually looked stale and gross - that we hadn't ordered. Figuring this was complimentary, we were about to take bites, until another waiter came running over asking if we had ordered it, and if we had eaten from it already. Turns out it was for another table. Somewhat disgustingly, he took it from us and re-served it to the correct table.

The courses were well done and timed well. The fish was cooked to perfection. The appetizer was so-so. Dessert was delicious. Ordering one final drink at the end of the meal, however, took forever to get to us (nothing fancy, just beer on tap).

The idea is wonderful with the local produce and meat, but the ambiance, noise, and price just weren't worth it to me. Would I give Graze a second shot? Probably, but not during restaurant week, and not on a weekend evening."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place, but I couldn't get over thinking it was over rated and over priced. The food is fresh and tastes good, but the portions were small and I felt they were quite varied between the dishes. 

If you get really excited about \"farm-to-table\" you might give them an additional star, but there are tons of restaurants in Madison serving farm fresh/responsible ingredients without going on and on (and on) about it every chance they get.

Would I come back? Sure, but not until I eat at a lot of other places first."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, right across from the capitol with floor to ceiling windows. A more casual mirror image of its sister restaurant next door. I had the Graze burger, which was decent. The cheese curds were good, huge chunks of fried cheese. I also had some kind of pecan pie, which was okay, but really not great."}
{"text":"Beautiful view if youre new to Madison, gazing at the Capiral building at sunset while enjoying PEI mussels! The Bibimap was fun and different, lots of kimchi but a touch too spicy, the beet salad was perfect. They also have a good selection of wine and beers. I may return before i leave."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I originally planned to go to the old fashioned. We must have been struck with bad luck today because we drove two hours to dine there! We were so disappointed! We found graze after walking around and trying to get into other burger joints. Those of course were too packed. We then went to graze and were expecting to get burgers, but they only offered the brunch menu. So we weren't really crazy about any of the options. However, we were starving and did not want to want in line at another busy restaurant. We heard their cheese curds were quite a hit so we of course had to try them. I'll admit it they were perfection. The cheese was melty and gooey and so so delicious. My boyfriend ordered the pub burger for his main course and I ordered the madame croque. My boyfriend ordered his burger medium and got his medium well. He did not understand why they put it on an english muffin because it was just plain soggy. My meal was pretty good but nothing worth raving about. The highlight was definitely the cheese curds. I was not into the atmosphere at all and the service was mediocre."}
{"text":"I tried the graze burger there. It is quite good, though a little bit greasy. The view is perfect and nice beer choice. And highly recommend cheese curd. They have the right souce with it. But remember to reserve a seat in ahead, otherwise too long a line during dinner time."}
{"text":"The food is excellent by bar food standards and they have some unique items. Most people would never think to order popcorn as an appetizer, but they make theirs with truffle oil and it's incredible! They also have great sandwiches, including one made with a duck liver pate that is very good if you like pate. The environment is very sheik. My one minor complaint is that the seating isn't very comfortable, but I still highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I was in town for business arriving to -27 degree weather. I'm happy to say the welcome was much warmer. I loved this place! The food was great (the soup could be served a bit warmer). This Florida girl won't be back in January (ever) but if I will absolutely return at any another time."}
{"text":"My go to spot for brunch

Graze has won me over.  My first couple visits were less than memorable - I could see the potential in the menu, but the execution left something to be desired.  But over the past year, the consistency kitchen and the service has improved considerably and Graze has been coronated as The Emperor of Madison Brunch until further notice.  

After a recent trip to the Madison Farmer's Market, my wife and I decide the dodge the rain drops and grab some morning vittles (and libations).  There are a thirty minute wait for a table, so we decided to set up camp at the bar.  The bartenders promptly welcomed us and took our drink order.   I tried the Retox (Cachaça, Maple Syrup, lemon juice, cayenne) and my better half went with the Bloody Mary.  At first I was neutral on the Retox, but it eventually won my over as the Cachaça (a liquor made from fermented sugarcane juice) cleared the fog from a soggy slog around the square.  The Bloody Mary was a little heavy on the horseradish for my taste, but my dining companion was very impressed.

As for the culinary component, I elected to try something new and ordered the Chicken-Fred steak.  Instead of the usual cream-based sauce, this version had a excellent brown sauce with a hint of sage which complimented the steak, which was top notch, it had a nice crunch, but not greasy.  The rest of te dish was satisfying as well.  Some lightly dressed grape tomatoes, crispy hash browns and two eggs easy over that were perfectly executed.    Portion size was just right - I cleaned my plate and felt satiated, but not bloated.  We finished off our brunch date with an order of the beignets, and their pillowy goodness was the perfect finish to an excellent meal.

While the meal was a bit on the pricey side for brunch ($55 for two drinks, two entrees and a dessert), we both felt the value of the meal exceeded the price.

There have been some complaints about the service at Graze, but the bar staff was courteous and attentive during our meal.  Despite a full house in a relatively open space, the noise level was not too bad - it was easy to carry on a conversation.

I also appreciate how Graze uses locally sourced products from area farms to create its menu.  As long as they can continue to effective execute the vision of Chef Tory Miller, they will continue to be my go-to option for brunch."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that Graze doesn't have higher ratings! I loved that the ambiance was casual but at the same time slightly up-scale (perhaps it was just the dimly lit dining area) - but I could definitely see myself there unwinding after a long work week with a drink and a burger and not feel awkward dressed in business casual. 

I have to say that I was very impressed by the menu and the whole concept of \"eating local\" - or maybe it's just because I am a Californian girl and I am impressed by anything Mid-Western that reminds me of the golden state (I really do love Wisconsin though, I promise!) 

Anyway...I'm not usually a big fan of cheese, but I found the cheese curds quite delicious, and not bland as other reviewers may have mentioned.  But I guess I've never had fried cheese curds before Graze, so I can't really compare. I'm just really glad that these ones were fried and did not squeak against my teeth. 

Besides the fried cheese curds, I also tried the veggie Pub Burger. The patty was a little dry for my taste and kept crumbling as I tried to eat it with a fork and knife, but otherwise it was a good effort. I have to say that my favorite part of the meal was the fries. Nicely seasoned, and deep-fried to perfection. Yum! :9"}
{"text":"Had the $21 burger which was a bit greasy and lacking in flavor.  Fries were not bad but too salty.  The Korean nachos I was expecting to be good, but had probably an ounce of beef with the rest comprised of cheese and a gochujang sauce. We ended up leaving more than half on the plate. Also had the pork belly baos where I was treated to the pleasant texture of cartilage in the pork. 

Really nice atmosphere but the chef is not doing the locally-sourced produce any favors with these menu items."}
{"text":"I love that Graze is dedicated to local producers. Everything on the menu is local and hence, super fresh. 

I had quite a difficult time picking out my brunch - I was debating between the tofu scrambler and the sausage. The idea of tofu and eggs sounds exciting but the spice factor scared me away to the safer choice. The sunny side up eggs were done perfectly - running smoothly into my potatoes and rye toast. The sausage was a soft texture and a true sausage flavor without any spices or cheeses stealing its thunder. 

My friends had the ramen, eggs benedict, biscuits and gravy - all a great choice and equally delicious. I always want to come to a breakfast place like this - a little risky and creative yet true to traditional brunch and cares for local farms. Yay, Graze! Can't wait to eat you for dinner!"}
{"text":"Best cheese curds and Mac & Cheese in Madison! Great experience with the waiters, and the atmosphere is nice too. The burgers might need a little work though."}
{"text":"The quality of service and food is satisfactory but the quantity of the food is not as good. Still felt hungry after I finished a plate."}
{"text":"My favorite place in Madison. I really enjoy taking out of town family members here because of their local food items and the beautiful view of the capital. Every time that I come for breakfast, I always order the special which is usually a scramble and it's always amazing."}
{"text":"I visited Madison, WI for only 3 days and I visited Graze 3 times.  It was so fantastic we kept finding a reason to go back.  Great drinks! Great food! Fantastic and interesting cheese selection (some amazing WI truffle goat cheese).  Just a great restaurant that is bright and beautiful with delicious food made from local ingredients."}
{"text":"I am loving Madison more and more. The locals vacate downtown after work and the parking is free after 6, how bucolic. I don't think I have parked more then 1/2 a block away from anywhere I wanted to eat.
A short stroll past the lone homeless man and I was at Graze. It shares the entrance with L'etoile which is the upscale sister restaurant.
I like the relaxed casual aura of Graze. All the glass makes eating inside feel outside or you can also opt to eat out side. I luckily picked a spot at the bartenders station and watched all the interesting cocktails being crafted.
So inital bummer there was no beer flight to taste their selection of on tap ales but YEA!! they let me taste everything. The sour is really sour; some of the others are very light. I went with the Scotch Ale, yum!
I started with the Pork bun... I was expecting a slider but got an abbreviated serving of crisp pork in a chinese style bun... little disappointed, my expectations exceeded reality. It was good but I would not get it again. The mixed green salad was good and standard.
Next I ordered a Wolverine and learned I am not a big fan of ginger syrup; I really wanted a margarita.
I finished with the Graze burger - delicious. The bottom bun is really just a sponge for all the juices coming oozing out of the burger. I suggest immediately flipping it over because the bottom bun is not very structurally sound once it has soaked up all the love from the burger. I really wanted to have the duck fat bun instead of the brioche. The fries were good.
Overall a wonderful meal with a little company from the bartenders.
I would have gotten dessert but there was nothing chocolate to my liking. Need to at least have one thing chocolate.
Great place and I like the farm to table concept. The menu is good and I want to go back for the chicken and waffles of the smash burger to get the duck fat bun. The steak read to be yummie but pricey."}
{"text":"One of our \"go to\" places when we come to Madison. The dishes are all very creative, tasty and generous. Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"Great bar and dining area. Outdoor seating is awesome (available during the months with nice weather in Wisconsin). Food quality is way up there, when I lived in Madison and wanted to take my wife somewhere for dinner, Graze was always in the running. 

Graze burger is up there as one of the best burger I've ever eaten. You must get an order of cheese curds for an appetizer, & if you enjoy oysters, like me, then you're going to want to also get an order. :)

Steak frites is melt in your mouth delicious. 

Those pork buns are a yummy way to start your meal.

I've also had the beet and walnut burger, the Wisconsin cheese board, kimchi deviled eggs, mac n' cheese. All good. 

Never left Graze unsatisfied, it is a must stop when I'm back in town for business."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a birthday drink and appetizer.   There was a 90 minute wait for a table so we decided to check out the bar.  We got 2 seats at the bar within 5 minutes with a great view of the capital.  We started off with some drinks and then cheese curds and the pretzel.  Delicious!  We decided to hang around and have some dinner.  Really quick service, great drinks (seasonal punch was yummy), and scrumptious eats.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended by training staff on my trip to WI.  I was disappointed.  I love burgers and was very excited about trying the Graze burger.  I was so underwhelmed!  The burger was $20+ and was so bland.  I added salt to it to make it palatable but I have had much better burgers at fast food restaurants.  My coworkers tried other dishes that were just ok as well.  They have a nice ambiance and drink selection but that's about it. The service was great and waitstaff was nice but save your money. :("}
{"text":"I've had good, and I have had bad.  The good, actually the best, were the Oysters.  Fresh, clean, chilled, and tastes like the ocean.  Having grown up on the ocean, I was shocked to eat oysters in Madison, WI that tasted like they had just been pulled out of the water.  I've had both burgers, and I think either one is ok.  The spendy burger, as I like to call it, just has WAY too much going on to really appreciate any one component.  I appreciate the ambition of this dish, but too much gets lost in the process.  The average burger is, well, it's average.  Far better burgers in other places around town.  The trout plate was simply amazing, and I was again stammered by it because I have been a fisherman for most of my life and trout have been my primary catch.  The bone marrow is something that you think might be gross, but once you've got it dressed up on the bread it all comes together well.  I'm not a person who easily deals with soft textures, but the marrow had me wanting more.  The cheese curds are hit or miss.  Some days, they are simply amazing.  Light, crispy and not overdone (I mean this in terms of cooking and size of curd), the first time I had these I knew they were the best I had eaten.  The pork entree, quite frankly, sucked when I ordered it.  I was shocked at how tough the ribs were, but the pulled pork was great.  The liver appetizer was good, and you'll probably love it if you're a liver person.  The fries are usually amazing.  Pork bun was good...I don't know what else one can say about a Pork bun.

I've eaten a couple of other items, but I can't remember enough about them to comment here.  That's not a dig on Graze, but I have found myself thinking that the biggest issue there is consistency.

Service has always been great when I have gone.  Alcohol selections are good as well.  I'll definitely be back because it's usually a good experience.  I've had some bad experiences, but I'm not going to hold those over Graze's head and get all uppity about it.  There are few restaurants in this world that are perfect.  Also, as much as people loved Soleil...I find the new location to be FAR better.  Ditto for L'Etoile.  Even though they just moved up the street, the ambiance and views are exponentially better."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese was amazing, and all of the employees were very very helpful and attentive!!!"}
{"text":"the decor fits warmly with the ethos of graze rather well. the atmosphere is lively but intimate. the wine list is surprisingly well-curated and the cocktails look fetching enough.

- the deviled eggs are forgettable but the smoked paprika aioli? holy damn. 
- the gratin is a little confusing to consume at first but it's a lovely simple dish for the cold season.
- the mac-n-cheese (minus the pork) was simply delectable.
- the artesian rainbow trout was perfectly seared.
- the curry vinaigrette in the warm farro salad was tasty.



all in all, this place defines gastropub."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait for a table for dinner.  Ended up eating at the bar.  Staff was prompt.  Mixed drinks were light on spirits, but still tasty.  The smash burger they offer is probably one of the best burgers I've ever had.  So much flavor that I can't begin to describe.  It was simply amazing.  Food was brought out so quick after ordering.  Great experience over all."}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Madison, WI. 
I am all about eating local and this place blows any self proclaimed local feeding trough out of the water. The ambience of the place is incredible; very minimal yet intriguing and warm. When it gets dark the view of the capital is spectacular and a real gem. The service was great and the staff was formal enough and very modern. I didn't mind paying a bit more for my bill because the food was absolutely perfect and I appreciate them supporting local farms in Wisconsin--especially in this crazy drought. The craft cocktail menu makes it hard to have just one! Also, the local beers on tap really gives it a down home Wisconsin feel. The only complaint I have is if you have to wait, they call your phone when your table is ready. However, if you do not have service or do not hear it you may be out of luck. I've always been a fan of a buzzer but I suppose that technology may be a bit tacky for the feel they are going for. If you're looking for a modern, fresh and flawless meal be sure to visit Graze."}
{"text":"I actually only thought this place was ok for the prices. Maybe I'm used to NY food/service and it's not a fair comparison.

We were initially told that it would be a 15min wait so we took a walk and came back. We ended up having to wait 30min which is a horrific difference, but still something that bugged me since I was starving at the time. It also was frustrating since when we were being seated there were a few tables that were open, but just hadn't been cleared. I don't think the efficiency of this place is that great.

The food itself was decent. We ordered the pork belly bun as an appetizer which was pretty good but not the best pork bun I had ever had. what I think really wasn't worth is was the tofu my dad ordered. You think that for $20 of tofu you would get more than 4 slices! Or at least get the most delicious tofu you've ever tasted! That was not the case at all...
However, my mom ordered their burger (which was $19) and that one was pretty good and I would say worth the $19, so I guess you should just order carefully."}
{"text":"An overpriced, overly trendy excuse for a restaurant!  Who runs out of chicken?  Seriously?????  Ordered the noodle bowl since they ran out of chicken and that thing was a complete fail.  It had no flavor unless you count old pork/pork belly smell and taste as flavor.  I do not!  It was supposed to come with a soft-poached egg in it- no egg to be found.  It really wouldn't have made the dish palatable regardless!  Should have just eaten at Tipsy Cow for lunch instead of only stopping for a drink while waiting for Graze to seat us.  And get some Moscow Mule mugs for Pete's sake!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Food quality, presentation and creativity was amazing. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Stop here to try their Magic coffee after hearing great reviews. I'm so disappointed after a couple of sips my coffee was gone!! Why?? Too much ice not enough coffee for the price. Other wise coffee was great."}
{"text":"Overall, the place was okay. Its a beautiful location in the heart of downtown. The view is great and the lighting is wonderful. 

I had the Korean bbq sandwich, which was spicy and pretty delicious. The side salad though was underdressed and overall a little \"eh\". 

My boyfriend had the pub burger, which once again was okay. It was fairly nice burger, but nothing to write home about. 

Our experience is an overwhelming meh. There are no true complaints, I was just let down by the hype associated with this place."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to brunch! The atmosphere is wonderful because the big window allows you to get a great view of the Capitol and makes the place so vibrant and bright. 

I usually go for brunch and start off with the beignets, which are fluffy and have the right consistency (essential for good beignets). I got the bibimbap breakfast burrito and as a Korean, I definitely approve of Graze's twist on this traditional Korean dish. The rice has a bit of spice, the meat inside is marinated very well, and the vegetables inside balance it out. The burrito is also huge so you could definitely share it or keep some leftovers to eat later. I would also recommend getting their pancakes with fruit because they use whatever fruit is in season and the pancakes are light and just sweet enough. Check this place out for brunch if you're ever hungry strolling down the farmers market or downtown on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I think this place is way over-hyped for what it offers. The Pros: The atmosphere is memorable, and the views of the capitol at night are beautiful. Their brunch selection is great, especially during the Farmer's Market, if you are content to wait in line. The Cons: Their bread and butter is dinner, and I feel that it leaves a lot to be desired. The menu is sporadic and lacks a consistent theme. I have been there a few times over the years, but I don't remember most of the things I have eaten because they were just average (as a foodie, I remember every detail of the many amazing meals I have had). A lot of the dinner items are basically lunch items with an upcharge, and I think the prices are excessive for the quality of the food. The drinks have also been hit-or-miss."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic!! The wait staff was very helpful in explaining items and friendly. A little loud but it was pretty crowded. Tried emu for the first time!!"}
{"text":"We went for lunch, and had the fried cheese curds. I also had the Korean Reuben (i.e., a Reuben with kimchi instead of sauerkraut). The variety and creativity of the menu is fantastic. The price is good for the quality. Recommended."}
{"text":"Yummy food, great staff. Next door to other high end sister restaurant. Beautiful view of the capital from many areas.
We also escaped the rain and grazed on some great food during farmer's market hours."}
{"text":"Oh Graze.

Graze, Graze, Graze, Graze, Graze. 

When we met, I was certain I was going to like you. I needed to have brunch, cocktails, dinner then lunch, cocktails, cocktails and cocktails, but I was pretty certain after my first trip we'd be close. 

And we are. 

I love the space; modern, but not annoyingly so. I love the situation behind the bar; boozy drinks that are \"spirit forward\" (heeeeey Tom). Bevies please those with a hankering for sweet or spicy and they don't cost an arm and a leg. (I mentioned they're boozy, yes?) Oh, and the food I've had their has been ta-heh-sty.

Burger = YUM. YUM. Perfectly cooked, hard to find... I find in Madison. 
Corned Beef Hash = Hash yeah!
Fish Fry = Panko? Yes, please. 
Chicken Skewers = Perfecto!
Anything on the cocktail menu! Anything.
Fried Pickles = Huuuuuuuuge deliciously breaded fried bits of joy. 

Service is always awesome. ALWAYS. And although it can be a little while for a table at din-din, staff is super nice about keeping you informed re: the wait sich. I'm going to miss sitting outside on the patio while it's cold, it's lovely out there."}
{"text":"Overall, a very disappointing experience for me. It was my first time here and the poor service and a lazy attempt at the apparently-infamous mac & cheese left a sour taste in my mouth.

A small group of us first came in today around 7-7:30pm and were told by a bearded man that it would be a 45 minute wait for a table. That would have been completely fine, had half of their dining area not been empty. Both tables and booths were set up to seat people, but apparently the staff wanted their customers to believe they were full. After 20 minutes of us waiting, the man begrudgingly led us to a booth - one that had been open since we got there. He led us to our table and walked away without smiling once.

Our female server was completely inattentive and lacked warmth. She never asked us how the food was or if we needed anything. It was as if our presence was an inconvenience to her. We asked another waitress for our check.

The 10-year old mac & cheese was mediocre, at best. It came out warm (as opposed to hot) with a pitiful amount of cheese. I don't know if the cook was intentionally half-assing the mac & cheese that night, but I could have easily made better mac & cheese at my own house. It took 30+ minutes to get our food, so I was hoping the time we spent waiting for it would be worth it. It was not.

The bearded man sitting up at the front & seating everyone turned many people away by telling them the wait would be 45 minutes. Empty tables continued to remain for the entire hour we were there. When we left, he didn't even look our way.

The only reason I'm not giving 1 out of 5 stars is because their cheesecurds are some of the best fried curds I've ever had. That's the only positive about this over-priced local restaurant.

My overall experience of Graze warranted a 2 out of 5 star review at best. Furthermore, I will not be returning and will encourage my rather large family to do the same.

ADDITION 07/13/17: I have no reason to believe the kitchen or wait staff was short that day. Would half the tables in the dining facility be empty just because the business was a little short staffed somewhere? If the room was crowded, and I saw 2 people working, then perhaps it would be different. The man at the front telling everyone who came in (turning down lots of business) wouldn't explain why we were told we had to wait 45 minutes, or also why our wait time was cut in half & we were seated at one of the empty tables... This is coming from someone who worked in the food industry as a waitress/server for 5 years, and there were many times I had 8 tables with 8 people all to myself. We never turned down customers and the only time there'd be a wait was if the entire facility was packed."}
{"text":"Amazing. Go there. You'll never forget it.

Whether you're a local or a visitor---it's not to be missed. We go every chance we get! The gnocchi is delicious but I've never had anything that was bad (I'll admit I almost vomited while trying the bone marrow but it had nothing to do with how it was cooked ;-)"}
{"text":"I gotta say I was disappointed. 
We went for lunch. Ordered a half sandwich and soup - grilled cheese and sweet pea. Definitely not impressed. Soup was fine but too much cream. Grilled cheese was uninspired. Hardly any cheese. Grilled onion flavor dominated. 
My friend orders the pulled pork sandwich and substituted fries for the cheese curds.  The sandwich had hardly any meat. How is that even conceivable?  The cheese curds were meh, sent them back for a salad. Mixed greens. 
Service notes:  
... The waitress didn't tell what items weren't available. Of course I picked the one not available. 
... I asked to taste the soup before I ordered it. Kitchen said no. I said fine I'll send it back if I didn't care for it. It was ok. 
... They brought us the wrong meals. 

Unimpressed. And honestly, I was so looking forward to it."}
{"text":"Things that don't make me sad: five-star lunches.

I am pretty obsessed with Graze even after just visiting once... I can see myself stopping here every time I'm in the beautiful city of Madison. It's such a gorgeous restaurant, and the natural light is bound to make any day better (so is that cocktail list, am I right?)

Speaking of cocktails... I tried The Claire ($10). It's a pretty pale pink and made with Graze watermelon basil shrub, Tito's vodka, lillet, and quince & apple citrus syrup. So fresh and delightful. The Farmer's Market caught my eye as well... it's an \"elderflower sparkler\" with elderflower blossoms and sparkling wine, two of my favorite things.

I made a rookie mistake and showed up only just a little hungry, so I ordered only a creamy tomato soup. It was so good, but I had so much regret I couldn't try more. The deviled eggs are certainly on my list for next time.

As you can see, I really love this place. Can't wait to try more of the menu soon!"}
{"text":"Okay, let me start by saying my review is going to be atypical.  We went to Graze for the Frozen Assets benefit party for Clean Lakes Alliance.  The entire restaurant was transformed to host this large themed event.  The ambiance was quite fun.  Graze catered the event and the hors dourves were very tasty.

The place was absolutely packed!  From everyone we talked to, people really enjoyed the venue and GRAZE was a very nice host/location for this party."}
{"text":"I crave the Bibimbap! It's a korean dish with lots of vegetables, tofu/pork, a fried egg, and spicy sauce. I order it without the crispy rice and sauce on the side because the tofu/pork is already marinated in it and it can be very overbearing. The cocktails change seasonally and are very eclectic. Other notable menu items: beet salad, burger, and quiche. Great for brunch, lunch, and/or dinner! Solid service. The only downside is that it does not take reservations for parties under 7 people. Once you arrive, you can leave your name and be put on a wait list. They will text you when your table is ready. The bar is first come, first serve."}
{"text":"On a recent business trip to Madison, we stayed at the Hilton by Monona Terrace. We asked the concierge about some good places to eat, and he suggested Graze for brunch. He was enthusiastic about it, so we figured we'd give it a try, and we were not at all disappointed!

We had about a 5 minute wait on a Sunday around 11 am, so I checked out the map they have in the waiting area. It's a map of the state and has pins for every farm they get their ingredients from (the list is also on the back of the menu). We were seated at a table right in front of the floor-to-ceiling glass windows facing the Capitol. It was an absolutely beautiful day out, and very bright. As soon as we sat down, our waiter adjusted the shades so we didn't have to wear our sunglasses while we were eating. My boss had already had breakfast at the hotel, so he ordered a cheese plate and said the waiter could choose what cheeses to serve. I ordered the nutella stuffed french toast, which was served with almonds and cherries. I was in heaven with my meal. They aren't large portions, but it was the perfect size and the flavors were simply amazing.

I don't anticipate another trip to Madison for a while, but if I ever come back, I'm making a beeline for this place."}
{"text":"Graze is located on the square around the Capitol. It has an indoor and outdoor seating area. The indoor seating area gets pretty crowded during the evenings and on the weekends. Usually, if you have to wait for a table, the servers will text your phone so you don't have to wait inside.

Their menu offers a limited amount of options. There are also only a couple vegetarian options and I am not sure if they have any vegan choices. I am usually surprised by this because most Madison locals recommend trying this place quite frequently. I know that Graze gets a majority of their produce from the Madison Farmer's Market which is great.

I enjoyed their cheese curds, but they are not the best cheese curds that you can get in Madison, in my opinion. I ordered their fish fry which was $18 and was about the same thing you could get for $8 at a local bar. If you're looking for great cocktails and average food check out Graze. They have an amazing view of the capitol and their service is excellen"}
{"text":"This place was really nice with high ceilings. My friends and I went for dinner around 9:45 pm on a Saturday night and as it was late, we were seated immediately.

I didn't have any drinks but my friends did and they said there was a large variety and they were pretty good. They also served beer in wine glasses which was interesting. The entire back of the menu listed where the restaurant obtains each ingredient which reminded me of portland. 

We started off with an order of cheese curds with ranch. They were absolutely delicious and cheesy! They tasted amazing with the ranch. I think the full portion ($9) would be too much for 2 ppl FYI (assuming you each have a main course coming). For my main meal, I got the \"Moules Frites\" ($17) which was a huge bowl of mussels in a tomato white wine sauce. It was a tiny bit spicy but it was pretty good! The waitress convinced me to get bread for an extra dollar to dip with but i thought the bread was too hard and didn't absorb the mussel sauce very well so I would not recommend that. The fries tasted really good with the garlic aioli sauce as well. My hubby got the \"Graze Burger\" ($21) with a salad. He said the burger was pretty good but he wouldn't get it again for $21... It was a bit pricey. I had a bite of my friends Mac and cheese, it tasted pretty good too but I would not get the pulled pork with it. 

Also, the waitress charged all of us a 20% service charge. I'm used to an 18% service charge for big parties and we would have tipped her 20% anyway but it was just unusual. We also split 3 orders of cheese curds among 10 ppl and she charged each of us 3/10 appropriately and gave us all separate checks which was nice! Overall, it was a nice dinner!"}
{"text":"Yum! Easily one of my favorite places for brunch in Madison. Disclaimer: I have only had brunch here.

FYI they don't take reservations. That being said, I've come here a few times now for brunch, all on Farmer's Market Saturdays, and never had to wait more than 15 minutes for a table. I typically come with 1-3 others. They take your phone number down with your name so if you decide to wander around the Farmer's Market during your wait they can call you when your table is ready. I find this super convenient.

The food is very fresh and most of the brunch items are very tasty. I've had the corned beef hash, scramble of the day, ramen bowl (the only thing I didn't like, but I probably should've known better than to order it), and tried the bagel and lox and beignets. Everything other than the ramen was delicious and well prepared. The staff is very accommodating to requests for leaving out or adding extra items.

The drinks are really awesome too! I love their bloody mary's and bellinis, and the seasonal lemonade is outstanding. It's made with fruit that's in season at the time, and is always extremely fresh tasting. 

Love the ambiance, the service is good, and the glass walls are awesome for looking out on the Square and watching the Farmer's Market craziness. Best of all, the prices are reasonable and the portions are appropriate for the cost. Check it out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Awesome seasonal selection of funky food, crawfish beignets- yes please! Great drink and wine selection.  Service was outstanding.  Lots of outside seating that offers a great view of the square. Recommened!!"}
{"text":"Possibly the best cheese curds in Wisconsin! Yum! Everything is fresh, delicious and unique. If you enjoy a Bloody Mary, I recommend trying one here. Great flavor and garnish. I got the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. Perfectly cooked eggs and bacon on the sandwich, which was paired with a perfect Swiss cheese; the dressing on the side salad was light, sharp and a great compliment to the savory sandwich. My boyfriend got the traditional breakfast and loved it. Also, there are great views of the capital! If you find yourself in Madison, eat here!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I love when I get the chance to visit Madison, and I love the fact that there are restaurants right next to the capital building.  Its just great! 
Anyways, I came here with a friend of mine who lives in the area and she had been telling me that I needed to come here for a while.  When we arrived it was about 7:30 pm and we were quoted about a thirty minute wait, not bad since it was dinner time and it was very busy.  We ended up waiting about 45 minutes and were giving into the idea of finally grabbing an open seat at the bar when we were called for a table.  We were seated and the host was very pleasant, and was able to grab my friend their gluten-free version of the menu.  Shortly after being seated our server came over and introduced herself, she was very nice and when I asked a question about one of the beers, she was very knowledgeable and I ended up trying the Spotted Cow which I really liked.  The restaurant serves complimentary bread with your meal, and can even substitute it for gluten-free bread if need be.  
As for the meal, my friend and I both ordered the pub burger (hers with the gluten-free bread) which came with fries and aioli on the side.  The food did not take long at all to arrive and looked very good.  The burger was great!  I really enjoyed it, and the fries were tasty with the aioli.  
The aspect of Graze which I really like is that it shops from local farmers and serves local Wisconsin beers and other items.  They even had a sign which showcased one of the local farmers.  
The overall experience was a good one, though I will be grabbing a seat at the bar next time if there is a wait.  I would definitely visit Graze again in the future."}
{"text":"Honestly I'm not a particularly big fan of Graze. On the couple of times I've been, my food has been well prepared and tasted good. 

My problem is for a place that is trying to do chef'd-up comfort food, the portions are too small and prices too high. They call themselves a gastropub but to me there's just not that chill pub vibe. Too much sleek, modern, overly composed wannabe fine-diningness. 

Again, the food is pretty good, but I've never left the place feeling like I've gotten a good value. I'm willing to throw down plenty of money in a restaurant, just here I feel like I spend too much for what I get."}
{"text":"Graze, how I love thee! We were originally planning to go to the Old Fashioned but the wait was 45 minutes. I looked on Yelp to see what was the nearest good restaurant and came across Graze. Whooooooo Hoooooo!!! 
The location and ambiance are awesome. You can see the Capitol through the gorgeous windows while you nosh on yummy food.
The burger was perfection! Well cooked and tasty, the perfect combination.
The Sauteed Gnocchi was mouthwatering FANTASTIC!
The dessert was a sorbet mixture of raspberry and aronia berry. FABULOUS.
I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Beautiful view of the capitol building. Service was more or less fine but nothing special. I ordered the roasted vegetables and mac & cheese. The roasted vegetables were fantastic, as roasted vegetables usually are. These were blissfully not drenched in oil and extra flavorful owing to the curry drizzle. I could eat those all day every day. The mac and cheese was good, though honestly a bit disappointing given the caliber of the restaurant. Frankly, I don't think Hook's 10-year cheddar is the right cheese for this dish and it could have used some mushrooms or caramelized onions, but still it was pretty good.

The small space didn't bother me like it seems to bother others. I thought the huge windows made it seem much bigger than it is. But I sat at the bar so maybe it's different if you are at a table? Though it seems like then it should bother you less. Who knows.

I totally forgot about their beet veggie burger. When I first looked at this place online months ago while I was still living elsewhere that is what caught my eye. Totally forgot about it tonight. Next time I'm getting that and skipping the mac & cheese.

And I thought it was a really good value. I had 2 glasses of wine, the roasted veggies and mac & cheese and my bill was $38. I'd happily pay that much just for the veggies!"}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday get together and the food was enjoyable, but, in my opinion, nothing I couldn't get in other restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"This place is open and tons of sunlight.  When we arrived we were seated at a two person table by the door in the middle of the restaurant but right away we noticed one of the seats was right by a vent and had air blowing directly in my face.  We asked to be moved.  Instead of a sorry we got \"I don't have any more two person tables\".   I went on to ask \"what about that table in the corner?\" Which was a 4 person table.  She said, \"um, ok.\"   From my opinion a hostess should hold the customers feed back with high regard and I didn't feel that we got this.  


Once we were seated the experience was great!   The food was good but I've had better.  The big highlight was the cheese curds.  These are the best thing.  Seriously the best cheese curds I've ever had.  Yew!"}
{"text":"A good \"place to be seen\" with drinks and fare that work for a gathering of colleagues or friends and ideal evening lighting for those who care about soft overhead \"glows.\"

I personally come here to grab a quick work day lunch (which offers an interesting clientele of 50% business people, 30% tourists and 20% college-aged kids who are making an impression or something). My go to is the bibimbap with tofu--it's really hearty, flavorful and comes with a great Korean red pepper sauce. Their unsweetened iced teas are really solid too.

It's always busy during the expected peak hours but the fun starts when the dinner crowd thins and you start to see the white collar \"I-bankers\" on their fourth round at the high tops and the 40-something year old couples sharing winks in the dimmed lighting. Good reality TV."}
{"text":"Graze is a great place to stop at if you want to sample Tory Millers style at a lower price point and a more casual atmosphere. The bone marrow and oysters I had were a bit small and underwhelming but the burger and steak we had was great. Excellent cocktails and a view of the Capital as well make it a good place to check off your list!"}
{"text":"I love almost everything about Graze. The service is always very friendly and knowledgable. I have dreams about their Korean nachos. I could live with that being the only food I ever eat. Some of the portions are a bit small though for other appetizer options though."}
{"text":"I love this location! It's right in downtown Madison, near the Capitol building. Super bright, sunny with large windows and outdoor seating. 

We knew we had to order the cheese curds- they were the main reason we chose to come to this restaurant! And boy was that a good decision. The cheese curds were absolutely fantastic, fried to a cheesy perfection. I will say though- the full size was quite a lot and by the end, I felt like I might have a heart attack!? But totally worth it. So just a heads up- if you only have 2 people, the half size might be enough to share. 

For drinks, we got an orange juice and their seasonal lemonade which was a cucumber lemonade. The orange juice was so fresh and tasted like it was just freshly squeezed, and the cucumber lemonade was super refreshing! Although I would stay away from that if you're not a big fan of cucumbers because the taste was very potent. 

For entrees we ordered the chicken and waffles (on menu it's listed as hot chicken and pickles) and I got the bibimbap burrito with pork. I didn't try the chicken and waffles so I can't speak to that but the burrito was only decent at best. The pork was flavorful but was ground pork, which was not what I had expected in the burrito. The rice was nice and crispy, similar to what you would get in a stone pot bibimbap. However, in a burrito, it was a hard to mix the ingredients together in a civilized manner. 

Otherwise, my experience here was very positive and I would definitely come back to try other menu items :)"}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time at Graze these days, so I'm going to share with you my 6-step program for doing Graze like a pro:   

1. Order The Retox (cachaça, maple syrup, lemon juice, cayenne - what? what?) 
2. Graze from a basket of warm, salty, truffley popcorn. 
3. Enjoy that I'm-feeling-classy-even-though-I'm-wearing-snow-boots ambiance.
4. Order another Retox (heads up, two Retoxes and you are totally toxed)
5. Dine on any number of spectacular meals.
6. Indulge your voyeuristic tendencies by staring out the walls of windows to crazy, crazy Madison. 

I know this formula works.  Last night, as I piled the bibimbap onto my chopsticks and into my face, a protest for Tibetan freedom marched around the Capitol.  And in the moment, as much as I wanted to free Tibet, I wanted another bite of that marinated tofu more."}
{"text":"I was here with my friends on an evening and the ambiance was wonderful mainly the outdoor sitting . 

The food was good but the quantity was not sufficient. The beer was good with lots of options.

The service was tremendous"}
{"text":"A great place to go for a date or with a small group. The building is very open with floor to ceiling glass walls, showing off the beautiful capital of the city. The menu is quite diverse, including traditional American dishes along with Korean and Mexican options. The ingredients are local, and the quality of the food is quite good.

Overall its an awesome place with a great atmosphere. My only qualms are whether the price of the food matches the taste."}
{"text":"This place seems to be going downhill.  Or else they don't care as much about the lunch crowd.  Cheese curds were reheated and pork rolls aren't as good as they used to be either.  Maybe the chef is spreading himself too thin?"}
{"text":"This was the worst meal I have ever had.  Ordered a burger well done... It came rare.  Hostess was totally unfriendly and un-emotional.  I would never, ever set foot in this joint again.  1st time in Madison, came recommended, it was awful!  Felt ill after the experience."}
{"text":"Food was tasty but heavy - mac and cheese, cheese sampler and cheese curds were delicious but the house burger was wonderfully flavorful yet straight up soggy with grease.

Ordered two of the quirkily named game of thrones cocktails and honestly both tasted like medicine. Drank two sips and tossed the rest. Stay away.

The place had a nice ambiance and attentive service though so overall decent experience."}
{"text":"Vegan dream. Amazing tofu scramble and they are willing to modify almost any dish. Even the Bloody Mary is vegan! The service was great with the staff very knowledgeable about the menu."}
{"text":"Graze is really amazing for food. Considering the quality of food, the price is extremely reasonable. The building location is very nice as well, large windows and great views of the capitol and square. We had the fried pickles as an appetizer, Hot Chicken and Pickles, Moules Frites, and for dessert Hickory Nut Bourbon-Caramel Pie. Everything was exceptional but I was blown away by the pie. It was wonderful. I wish I could live in that pie. The only reason this place gets 4/5 stars is because the cocktails (warm mulled wine and the Marquez Collins) were really lackluster. To me and my dinner guest, they tasted watered down. I'll opt for a solid beer next time. Server was very nice, someone was always nearby to remove plates, refill water, etc.

Edit: Went there again for a friend's birthday. Drinks are A+! Awesome!"}
{"text":"Well worth the price! The view is amazing! Try a craft cocktail but don't get the pineapple jalapeño tequila drink it's way too smoky. I had a veggie burger they make there and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I want to give this place more stars. I really do. However, I always leave feeling just \"okay\" for the hype, location and concept. 

Love, love love the cheese curds. Try those - they are excellent. Cocktails are good. Menu is good, but somewhat small. 

The Graze Burger is $21 and was SO disappointing. Not a bad burger, but for that price I want to be wowed! It was okay. 

Graze for me is one of those places where I am glad I have been there, but they are never high on the list when deciding where to go out for a dinner. Nothing is too memorable other than the amazing views of the Capitol. I do enjoy their concept of using local ingredients."}
{"text":"I heard great things about Graze, and it definitely met the hype. I had a Moscow Mule, fried pickles and a pork bun. Everything was tasty, the atmosphere was nice and the service was solid. I'll definitely be back next week when I return to Madison!"}
{"text":"What a great find from yelp! We walked in without reservations, were told it would be a 30mins or so wait. Decided to hang out by the bar while waiting. We were able to find a spot, so we ordered pork bun abd 1/2 order of cheese curds while waiting. Pork bun was relatively smaller than those we have in NY, taste wise it was pretty good. The cheese curds were amazing! 

We were seated before we finished our appetizers,  but the hostess so gracefully moved us with our appetizers.  For dinner we enjoyed a steak and mussels. Both dishes were done very well and tasted good. Service was a little slow, but friendly. 

Love the high ceilings and great view of capitol. Overall, a great fancier meal in madtown!"}
{"text":"I've been to Graze a couple of times for lunch. The farm-to-table concept is well done here and the food tastes fresh. It's a great view with windows overlooking the Wisconsin State Capitol right across the street. I love that they give each table a pitcher of water. The service could be improved. Both times it's been very slow and I've had to ask for items that I need and for the check. There was a lunch crowd, but it was not overly busy during these times. I also feel like the prices are too high. There are a lot of lunchtime and food cart options in downtown Madison and it costs more to eat here - makes me feel like they're a little pretentious."}
{"text":"Delicious food, helpful service, and a laid-back atmosphere. The menu is constantly changing to adapt to the food that's fresh and available.

I've been for brunch and dinner; both have been spectacular!"}
{"text":"Over a year ago, I had 3 stars, then I updated with 4, and now I'm finally updating with 5. I've been twice in the past month and I've just been flabbergasted with how good everything has been. Might be my new favorite Madison restaurant ...?

I went to Graze for dinner on my birthday and coincidentally and happily got the same waitress, Mickey (Mickie?), as the time I came about a month ago with two friends. Yay! She's so so nice and easy to talk to. She knows her stuff about the food, too.

Derek (my fiancé) and I started off with a potato/creamy goat cheese dish. OMG. After we finished the potatoes, there was still all this perfectly good goat cheese left, so we ordered the most. amazing. breadbasket. ever., and had a blast. The funniest part was, while waiting for the breadbasket to come, 3 different people came to pick up the goat cheese dish. We'd tell them, \"Oh, actually, we want that as dip for our bread,\" and every one of them said something along the lines of \"Genius.\" And it was, my friends, it was. ALWAYS ORDER THE BREADBASKET.

Derek got the bibimbap dish with the pork. He's been sick with a cold that traveled up to his nose so it was hard for him to taste things, but he still loved this. Ate it all up. Loved the veggies to help make the cold go away, too!

I decided to go crazy and get the Hook's mac 'n cheese. I'm so happy I did. A waiter suggested a bit of Sriracha and that was just as genius as the bread + goat cheese. With all the bread I ate, I couldn't finish the mac 'n cheese, but that just meant that I had majestic leftovers.

We ordered dessert after this too. My cheesecake fell a little flat, but I think I was just too full to enjoy it.

I loved the space at night. These windows are amazing. They make it feel so cozy at night, with candles all around. I love the lighting at the bar. I just love this place."}
{"text":"Great place to take guests visiting Madison. I went here about six or so times in the past year, for dinner and lunch. Except for the last few times, I generally had a pleasant experience. The atmosphere is perfect for guest because the dining area is overlooking the Captiol. The atmosphere is not too fancy, but not too casual. 

As for food, the cheese curds are great! Their burger was also flavorful and wonderful.The cheese board was underwhelming a few times I tried it. Otherwise, you really can't go wrong here with most of the items on the menu."}
{"text":"New Years Eve, three course meal with wine pairing. 

First time here, check in was a little long and delayed for some reason with an awkward silence but I'm not even gonna deduct anything for that because we had a great time at Graze. 

We started out with some rice popcorn and truffle oil. Omg. Addicting. A little Parmesan dust on it. My first drink was a nice citrus with gin. Very good. Can't remember the name of it. 

Appetizers were a Scottish egg perfectly cooked. Second time ever having one and this one out did the last one I had by far. My wife had the foie gras with short ribs. Very very good. My second drink was a Pinot wine. Excellent pairing. 

Onto dinner, two different meals. My wife's lobster style poutine with gnochi was very cheesy and heavy. Almost a little too greasy and heavy. Tasted good but maybe would of chosen something different if we would of known how greasy it was going to be. Had us at lobster. I had a GREAT pork loin with lentils. First time having lentils. Delicious cherry sauce that complimented the pork perfectly. Wasn't familiar with my third glass of wine but went well with the pork.

NOW...the show stopper of the night. The cheesecake with rhubarb and chocolate cake were to die for. Absolutely, hands down thee best deserts I think we've ever had. My port wine was delicious as well but I can't rave enough about these desserts. Amazing. 

Great service and a top notch place. We definitely went to come back and sample the rest of the menu."}

Located just steps from the capital and owned by the team behind L'Etoile, my dinner destination later that evening, it was to Graze that my lunch plans led me after a tour of Camp Randall Stadium and although expediting from the kitchen would prove oddly paced, at best, my meal in the sunbathed space left very little to be desired.  Featuring a farm-fresh menu focused heavily on Wisconsin purveyors with floor-to-(20+foot)-ceiling windows offering wide views of the midday bustle outside it was near the rear of the restaurant that I opted for a shaded seat and with a menu of daily specials alongside several signatures a three-course meal of small plates was created, the service itself perfectly pleasant in offering up apologies for long delays from a kitchen that was dreadfully slow in preparing something as simple as a charcuterie board despite the restaurant being less than 1/3 full.  Certainly not starving after a hearty breakfast it was after nearly thirty-five minutes that my selection of three cheeses and two meats with several house-made accoutrements arrived and with each item tallying $3-to-$3.50 aside from the ultra-aged cheddar I'll simply say the additional $5 surcharge was entirely worthwhile, a sharp bite to the golden wedge better than any I tasted in England and just inching out the pate de Campagne for best thing on the pig-shaped board.  Having mentioned issues with the kitchen I was unfortunately only a quarter into the charcuterie when my three hot plates arrived and setting aside the cold board with a bit of annoyance I found even more frustration with the overcooked pork belly, a limp and flavorless bao doing little to improve the flavor as pickled cabbage dominated each bite.  Moving past the buns to things far superior it was next in Graze's signature curds that I did partake and squeaky-as-hell with plenty of brine I greedily dipped each bite in ranch - a flavor I generally dislike adding an aromatic finish to each bite.  No less impressed by a salty pretzel with delicate chew beneath a soft, golden top it was back to the charcuterie that I turned as plates were collected and opting for one of three desserts another long delay would transpire, the twenty minutes thankfully justified by a hot slice of pie loaded with nuts and molten caramel atop a crisp and buttery crust."}
{"text":"One of my top favorite places for dinner in the city.  Their truffle oil popcorn is totally signature, and really yummy!  I've eaten here numerous times, and their Graze burger is always worth every penny.  I recall it won some kind of prestigious burger award at a contest out in NY.  The ambient is one of the best in the City, imho, for a more formal dining experience without being too culturally stuffy."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their tofu in any dish but my go to dish is the Bibimbap! Sticky rice with heat and vegetables to the brim of a giant bowl of flavor always hits the spot. On my healthiest days the Steak Salad and the Salmon Salad are solid mainstays.

They also have a salted caramel cookie that must be a secret. I don't know why friends who know me as a cookie monster haven't shared that one with me but order one for the table."}
{"text":"This is a terrible place.    If I could give zero stars I would.  First, this restaurant does not understand what food allergies are even though they indicate on their menu that they do.  It is a huge problem for people with celiac as items labeled as gluten free were not gluten free as the food was cooked in oil with gluten item.  My friend would have gotten very sick if we had not made the waitress ask.

Next, one item was horrible and not at all what we thought.  The turkey sandwich was made with dark meat.   Nothing was said that it was dark meat  or a mishmash of turkey and the manager got huffy about it, saying they did not waste anything on the turkey, meaning it could have contained ALL parts of the turkey.  When we complained, the manager just said she had taken a little off the bill because my friend has \"enjoyed\" several bites.  That was so untrue as she took apart the terrible wrap looking for white meat (and found none).  Only after our insisting again and again did she remove the item from the bill.

All in all, customer service is atrocious and the manager was poorly trained on how to treat customers.

With all the good restaurants in Madison, this one should definitely be avoided, especially for those with food allergies and those who want good customer service,"}
{"text":"GRAZE was such a treat, from start to finish. Every aspect of this place was a win! It felt upscale but simplistic at the same time. We ordered off the happy hour menu- coffee, cheese board, pork bun, salad, and cheese curds--- a must! If you don't try the curds you are doing it wrong. Visiting from Seattle and just driving through Madison for the day, I'm happy we went here. Check it out"}
{"text":"Really great food. Nice atmosphere. Sophisticated and right across the street from the capitol. The prices were fairly good, the menu varied but not too big. Menu items were unique and well done. I had a a seasonal mushroom gnocchi that was unusual but tasty. Service was attentive but not intrusive and our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu, preparation and ingredients. Like that food is locally sourced."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant and would recommend to anyone looking for a good place to eat. They feature farm-to-table which is all the rage now in urban restaurants and a menu with a variety of selections to appease any foodie and non foodie alike.

What we ate:
Nutella French toast (very sweet)
A cheese plate: excellent!!
Cheese curds: oh so cheesy goodness
Fresh squeezed juice-lemonade: refreshing.

The French toast was a bit sweet for me, but all were great to eat. I would totally come back and would recommend to anyone in or passing through Madison!!"}
{"text":"Mixed emotions for this review. Awesome cheese plates. Great Korean bowl. Undercooked graze burger. Beautiful setting. How could some things be so awesome and others fall flat. Sad that my experience was jaded because waitress in training didn't ask how I wanted my burger cooked and then delivered a tartar on a bun. When did any burger come out rare?  Except in 1 star restaurants. 

Wish I could give you another chance but bright red isn't my favorite color. I've eaten at your sister restaurant L'Etoile and always been amazed. Not so on this visit right next door.  My heart just fell on the floor."}
{"text":"Great selection of local food.  Everything is delicious.  The service was very professional and polite. We'll be back!  Seating can be hard to find so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Madison by far. I had the bibimbap and cheese curds. Both were amazing. The cheese curds were probably the best I've had in Madison. I will definitely be back. Try and get there early, it gets packed!"}
{"text":"I love Graze! Their environment is lovely and the food is good. My to go items for a typical dinner at Graze are cheese curds, bone marrow and mussels and frites;)"}
{"text":"This restaurant is doing it right.  Appetizers were great. We had the pickle board, cheese curds and pretzel.  Everyone's meals were prepared correctly and the appearance was spectacular.  Kids loved their food.  I had the burger and I wish I would have picked the steak and fitted, but it was still great."}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night so naturally it was busy. We put our names on a list and waited about an hour for a seat, which isn't too bad if you wait at a nearby coffee shop or bar because they text you when your table is free. I think our server's name was Rachel, she was really sweet and helpful. We ordered a bottle of sparkling wine (it was so good and sweet!) We also ordered cheese curds, which were pretty massive. I ate about two or three of those and was done. I ordered the Wisconsin whitefish. I asked if I could substitute the tomatoes with something, but they told me no subs... So I got it without the tomatoes. Overall, I thought the entrée was plain and wanted more flavor out of it. Last we ordered the grasshopper sundae which was a mint chocolate dessert, and it was pretty good! I'd like to come back to try more because I like the atmosphere, but maybe not for dinner... The whole menu consists of red meat, which I don't eat."}
{"text":"Defiantly my favorite place for brunch! Some of the highlights include... The beignets, these pillows of love are comparable to those found in New Orleans French Quarter so I've been told. Another notable appetizer is the Sassy Cow cheese curds. A food that we've all had before but done with the finest Wisconsin cheese and battered in a light house made breading, these will be gone in a heart beat. For an entree I would recommend the chicken and waffles which gets some extra pizzaz from the local maple syrup and the seasonal fruit from the farmers market across the street. If you're looking for a hardy breakfast sandwich look no further than the loaded breakfast sandwich. It combines all elements of a wake me up breakfast with bacon, ham, 2 kinds of local cheese, spinach and topped off with a runny egg. Perfection between two pieces of bread.

I could say more but why when you can go and sample some of the amazing eats(all made with local ingredients) for yourself, it's sure to be a great start to your Sunday."}
{"text":"I ate at Graze for a Sunday brunch. i've been wanting to try this place FOREVA. I walk past it all the time and see it packed. I say down for a brunch, the wait was not that long. They wouldn't seat 2 of the 3 people in my party before all three were present. The place was clean inside. It wasn't too loud and tables weren't too close together.

I ordered a coffee which tasted like standard restaurant coffee. Our drinks were refreshed often and order placed quickly. The server was friendly and explained one of the dishes for us.

I ordered the nutella stuffed french toast which was about 9 dollars. I LOVE NUTELLA. She said it comes covered in some kind of strawberry type sauce. I said that is fine. The dish itself was not very good, I'm not going to lie. There were about 3 or 4 pieces of bread with nutella spread on the inside. The bread was extremely soggy. I ate it but I could have definitely made waaay better french toast at home and for cheaper. The sauce tasted fine but it just wasn't anything special. It tasted like store bought canned strawberry sauce. I also had a side of hash browns which was probably the best thing I ate all day. it was cooked perfectly and just the right amount. The potatoes tasted fresh.

Overall, I wasn't too impressed with this place. The service was fine and the ambiance was nice. The food just wasn't great. I would go back and try their dinners but probably wouldn't have brunch again."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot of great things about Graze but honestly was not impressed. Menu is average, food is average, service is average. I may have gone in expecting something more but I feel there are too many good food options in Madison to make this a regular spot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here Saturday evening,  it was pretty packed so we sat at the bar and ordered our drinks. We also ordered a full order of cheese curds to snack on while we drank and hung out. So, I should have started out with that we were on a cheese curd mission that night, going to all the top places down town and trying cheese curds..  Yeah I know right  Before here we were at The Old Fashioned which is RIGHT up the street and they have by FAR the best cheese curds. I really disliked Graze's curds. They were flavorless and the homemade ranch was so nasty.. We decided it was tarter sauce and the server had to have accidentally given us the wrong condiment, it was sweet.. And ranch should not be. We'll come back to try more of the food but I have no clue why they are on the top list for best cheese curds,  I can name numerous places that are far better. Like Culver's lol"}
{"text":"Graze is a spot I am always returning to hoping it will be better than last time. Now, don't get me wrong - I like their food, I really do. Their burgers are tasty, their fries are great, and their brunch menu is really nice as well. But, they just aren't consistent. When I say that, I mean 3 people could order the same things and each of them would turn out differently. One person would have soggy fries and an under-cooked burger, one person could have perfect fries but an over-done burger, and one person could have everything perfect. It's just so random how things will turn out. 

The recipe is right: locally sourced, high quality, ingredients. A menu that is diverse but simple, and decent prices. They just need to make sure that food is just right when it goes out.

A great example is one time I had brunch and my toast had mold all over it. Super gross, right? Well, the waitress and chef agreed. They were very apologetic, gave me new toast, and covered my meal. But why the hell did I get served moldy bread i the first place? It wasn't exactly hidden, you know? Luckily the rest of my meal was very good and I gave them another chance, but I know a lot of people who would have never gone back. 

Someday I hope I get to upgrade them to 4-stars, because I sure do want to."}
{"text":"Beautiful space, mediocre food. Under-seasoned, undercooked. Wish the food matched the decor."}
{"text":"Graze is one of my favorite restaurants in town. In my opinion, they have the best fries in town, and their deviled eggs are to die for! I've never had a dinner I didn't like at Graze! I am not crazy about their very limited brunch menu though, which is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday afternoon with a good friend. Very nice view. We parked right across the street:) so lucky! I recommend the noodle!! Tastes so yummy and they put a lot of different ingredients in it. Love the place"}
{"text":"It has a great view of the capitol building!

I wish I could say the same about the food. 

Very hyped by the staff as the best burger he's ever had (the Graze Burger)- it was \"ok\" at best, and not worth the $23! Now, I could be jaded because I ordered the Steak Frites which was returned because the $10 steak meal I received from Blue Apron last week was a better cut of meat. The apologized and switched it for the burger, but you know how I feel about that.

Oh well! I'm glad I enjoyed the date with my wife!"}
{"text":"Tasty drinks, tasty apps, tasty dishes!

We had fries and added truffle aioli with the truffle popcorn for an app.  The truffle didn't come through in the popcorn much, but it was kinda fun to dip it in the aioli from the fries.  Either way it was tasty and fun and the garlic aioli that normally comes with the fries was tasty too.

I couldn't decide between the delicious looking burger and the chicken and hot pickles (waffles) for my entree but wound up with the latter.  The waffle was good and the chicken was really good and REALLY big.  I'm amazed at how big this thigh was.  Either way it was nice to know that it was locally sourced (as it appears most of their food is).  The breading was great, the chicken was moist, and there was plenty for the dish and then some.  The dish also included pickles, salmon butter, and some kind of a fancy syrup as well (though the syrup just tasted like syrup to me).

Service was all very friendly and top notch.  The space is a little crowded, but it is also REALLY neat.  The big glass windows overlooking the capitol building provided for a great view - even at night.

Prices are a little expensive, but nothing too crazy and understandable for the location and food quality.

If I had one minor complaint it is that I had just taken a small bit of my second (also large) piece of chicken, but since it was more difficult to cut than the main piece I decided to save it for home.  It didn't make it in with the other leftovers in the take-home bag.  I get the misunderstanding, but it's just one of those silly things that always seems to happen when the restaurant wraps up the food for you.


In any case - if I need a place to eat in Madison Graze is at the top of the list!"}
{"text":"The sh*t here.  This is a true representation of what the Midwest is turning out to offer. Fine artisan food sources with the finest local ingredients. Graze is a gem for Madison and all the Mideast.  Chef Tory miller shines here and I found why. Food is so well thought of and the ingredients and are left to come thru. 

We came here on a Sunday for brunch and had a great time. Absolute must is the croquet sandwich with a fried egg. So incredibly good with a beautiful buttered bread, melt in your mouth ham, and perfectly cooked egg sunny side up. Then try the loaded breakfast sandwich within bacon, 2 kinds of cheese, and fried egg. Wow so creamy and salty. Last try the pancakes with the cayenne butter

Drinks for brunch are good as usual but a stand out is the restore cocktail with plenty of lime and beer. Quite refreshing. If you're any where near here, this is a must."}
{"text":"0% probability cheese curds can be made better by anyone. If you are ever in Madison, make it a priority to stop in. Service, food & drinks were spot on."}
{"text":"I have been to Graze twice to have drinks but didn't eat until last night.  It was delicious! My sister and I were seated right away at 730 on a Saturday night... the lack of the final star is due to our subpar seating; in a corner right by the fire escape.  Still, no problem.  We weren't drinking but I have before and know how tasty the drinks are.  We ordered fried pickles, a cheese plate and bipimbip (a Korean dish).  Our server helped us choose the cheeses; 12 yo Cheddar, bandaged Cheddar, truffle goat and a cheese mix of goat, cow and sheep.  They were all wonderful. My sister like the 12 yo and I couldn't get enough of the mix.  They are reasonably priced and the service was really great.
I also love Graze's persistence to deliver locally and organically sourced food."}
{"text":"Adequate bar food; sub-par for Korean-inspired food, upscale looking happy hour. Graze is an almost average gastropub. (Alchemy, Weary Traveler, Harmony, even Old Fashioned offer more interesting, tasty meals.) If you want Kraft-mac bland, the Korean food is fine (seriously,  Kraft would have to skip the cheese to match the plain flavor of Graze). Kimchi is supposed to be fermented, not rotted. Without crispy rice, there is no proper bibimbap. Suits and hipsters circle each other nervously over cocktails; if this is your scene, you're keeping the doors open. Food sales do not. In a smaller pond this would be bigger fish food. There are many better options, some within a  block or two."}
{"text":"I spent more than an Andrew Jackson on a hamburger.  Please don't tell my father.  

That said, the Graze burger is easily worth a Benjamin Franklin.  

Easily!  

Best...burger...I...have...ever...tasted.

Multiple types of meat, ground up into a perfect patty, then expertly cooked to a medium rare loveliness.  The onion compote and the bun are the icing on the cake.

Suck it up and spend the money.  The Graze burger beats steaks at most places.  

Thank you, Chef Tory."}
{"text":"Weekend brunch at Graze is just about perfect for my taste. The food is simple and fresh. The service is top-notch. The servings are the right size for me - I always leave a clean plate but I'm never hungry when I finish. The prices are reasonable. The quality's been consistent throughout several visits. Particular highlights for me include the bibimbap, the hash, and the fresh juice concoctions.

Graze is a great example of how to prepare high-quality, locally sourced food without breaking my wallet or subjecting me to a bunch of hipster attitude. I'd give it six stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place is so memorable! I went here when in-laws were visiting and it was such a great spot to showcase and enjoy. Another review mentioned that it felt like Madison royalty and I think that sums up the experience nicely. The location is right on the square and the building has a terrific view with all its fancy glass walls. The food selection is great and has some innovative offerings. Yes, prices are kind of steep but the taste, quality and appearance of the dishes were on point. 
I had the chicken and waffles and it was definitely one of the best versions I've tried. That maple butter was mmmmmmmm! The ingredients are supposed to be local (makes sense as the farmer's market takes place right there). 
I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Apps and a dessert were perfect date meal.  Bartender was helpful and attentive, despite the crowd.  The roasted summer veggies were delicious along with the bread basket. They bake their own bread and the herb-cheese clover roll was buttery and savory.  My mouth is still fantasizing about that roll.  The hazelnut pie with ice cream topped things off--not to be missed.  And we weren't even so stuffed we couldn't comfortably roll back to our car. 

As others describe, the space is large with modern decor, very high ceilings and the large windows with view of the capitol. 

 I was rather embarrassed when the bartender repeatedly told an older lady that her happy hour chip had 'expired,' even though it was only a few minutes past 6PM.  Geesh, give the lady a beer and chalk it up to good relations."}
{"text":"Only had one night in Madison and I'm glad this restaurant was recommended by a friend who attends the university. Food was great and appealed to my kids too. Atmosphere was great, high ceilings and modern open feel. Friendly staff also. Wish I could go back. Mussels & Frites was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Fantastic concept, exceptional food, friendly wait staff, and clean, simple decor. We had a fantastic experience at Graze, so much so that over the course of a weekend, my friends and I wound up going twice in 2 days. As a UW alumni, I was thrilled that Madison gained such a great restaurant in a prime location. We made friends with a particular bartender who was true WI friendly (ah, home-state pride) and introduced us to beautiful drinks like The Magic Bullet... Graze's Magic Coffee plus bourbon. Instant friendship. Brunch was amazing - boast-worthy cheese curds, corned beef hash, kielbasa, and noodle bowl. Graze impressed the foodie out of towners of our group, and I am planning on making sure I stop by each time I'm back in Madison. U Ra Ra!"}
{"text":"Korean BBQ was too saucey and salty. Don't get that. Overall still a cool restaurant but my meal wasn't great"}
{"text":"I have been back to Graze twice for food since my first review. I continue to be impressed by the food and my most recent server was really great. But the server I had for my second visit caused me to reevaluate my five stars. I took two friends from out of town there for brunch, and since they weren't from Wisconsin, some curds were a necessity. We ordered those as an appetizer. And waited... and waited... Our entrees came out. The waitress asked if we needed anything else at the moment. \"Just waiting on those cheese curds.\" We waited some more and ate our entire entrees. Still no cheese curds, and since we ordered them as apps we were pretty annoyed at this point. The waitress came back, asked how everything was, and said she would go check on the curds. Finally, after finishing our meals and waiting beyond that, the curds came and had solidified in the middle instead of being hot and gooey. The waitress's excuse was that \"a weird amount of people had ordered cheese curds at the same time.\" And that was it. She did not offer to comp them nor did she really apologize. We had ordered a full order and barely ate half because we were full from our entrees. I was really disappointed in her service. Offering to comp something makes all the difference in a diner's experience, and she chose not to do this."}
{"text":"Beautiful backdrop, the Capital, and glass front from floor to ceiling is wonderful.  Love the chocolate cookie dessert!  Oysters and mussels were delicious."}
{"text":"Graze has an incredible ambiance which makes the entire meal process relaxing and fulfilling! I especially loved their cheese curds as they are served with a special dipping sauce. Gotta' love that sauce. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Super slow service....kinds of ridiculous really how long we waited to order and then to receive our food. 

It was definitely worth the wait but this would not be my first option when looking for a quick bite, or even a moderately quick bite! (expect to spend at least 2 hours here) 

We were here for brunch on Saturday and there was about a 15-20 minute wait which went by quick! I got the burger on a biscuit and the salad that came with it was great! I was NOT full after and was disappointed at how small the \"burger\" was. The BF got the loaded sandwich (i think that's the name) and that was WAY better--we went halfsies so we could try both ;) 

In the end, don't come starving because there it will be a bit of time before you get your food and order the loaded breakfast sandwich!!!! MMMm Ham ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to Graze now for one standard dinner, one brunch, and a handful of late night reverse happy hours.  Graze is always on point-- the servers are friendly, bartenders are responsive, and the food tasty. 

The emphasis and extreme highlight (giant cheese-board chalkboard on the wall, I'm calling you the extreme highlight) of local food is always nice to see.  Tight beer list-- always a few tantalizing options on tap.  And the food! 

I am a total sucker for a well executed brunch.  My dining companion & I shared the beignets, and I had the corned beef hash.  The beignets were delightful-- light and fluffy little fried dough pockets. The hash was awesome as well (I think this is where I admit I'd never had a poached egg before-- I'm sorry to disappoint you, egg-gods, and I beg forgiveness, because if they're all as good as Graze's, I am all about it). We got there right as they opened for brunch, which was fortuitous for us-- no wait, great service, fast & excellent food.

Late night happy hour is busy, which I find kind of surprising (what are all these *other* people doing out on a Monday night?).  The crowd is varied and friendly, it's a great way to extend a weekday night out. 

Graze is quickly becoming my go-to for a solid local meal, and is already an excellent nightcap default."}
{"text":"Sorry. Just really didn't like it. The service was very slow, but he was polite. The cheese curds we found to be tasty and if you are here I would get those. But the meal was terrible. I ordered the gnocchi, a dish I normally like. It was more than didn't like it, it was terrible. Could only eat a few bites. I can't recommend this place and won't be back."}
{"text":"Place is nice...a little over the top for my liking but nothing bad. Came in on a Thursday night at 7:30 and still needed to wait 35 minutes to be seated. I guess they are always pretty busy. They have a stand menu and one that changes as they use whatever is locally fresh and available. I tried a sausage plate - very good: friend had the trout and said it was amazing."}
{"text":"Every single time I've gone here my order has come out wrong the first time around. The waiters are always very apologetic and polite, and the food -- once they get it right -- is pretty solid... but it's just too much of a hassle to be worth the price and wait times. I feel like this is just one of those great concepts that could be wonderful if it were executed with a little more care, but as is doesn't live up to the hype or price."}
{"text":"A Madison staple that is frequently swarming with people--for good reason. A great place for dates and large families alike, with plenty of options from ritzy comfort food to the adventurous bibimbap. I've been here half a dozen times over the years and I have always had a great experience."}
{"text":"Where do I even start? I guess I'll start off by stating that I'm a proud Chicago transplant so my opinion of Graze my be totally different from the locals. In my humble opinion Graze is all flash and no substance. Aesthetically Graze is gorgeous. The view of the Capital directly across the street adds to the ambience. Unfortunately that's the only good thing I can say about Graze. 

The food is mediocre. I have no idea how people can give this place 5 stars but then again this is Madison Wi so the rating makes sense. My 6 year old daughter can make better food. For me that is a serious problem. How do you ruin something as simple as Chicken and Waffles? The staff is also very rude and inattentive. I literally saw the hostess berating a customer. Totally unacceptable in my book. 

Enjoy Graze for the view and the aesthetics not the food..."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Graze for a quick lunch on my way to Devil's Lake State Park. I know L'Etoile gets all the praise but the restaurant is only open for dinner..

I was a little surprised (and skeptical) that the menu had so many Asian-inspired dishes but ordered an assortment to \"graze\" on anyways. Tried the pork buns, cheese curds, pretzel, and bibimbap. 

The pork buns were unimpressive. The buns were a little too steamy at wet and the pork belly was just okay. I will definitely reserve my pork bun ordering for a Chinese restaurant. The cheese curds were good but I'd still prefer the curds from the WI State Fair any day. The pretzel was decent but the real star would have to be the assorted dipping sauces -- several types of mustard and cheese. As for the bibimbap (the dish I was most skeptical about).. it was actually pretty darn good. It contained Korean BBQ pork, a generous portion of assorted veggies (which I appreciated), and an egg. BUT the best part of the bowl were the surprise little cubes of crispy rice. It added a nice touch of crispiness that I've never before experienced in a bowl of bibimbap. Definitely a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"My husband and I just finished dinner and decided to head over to Graze for a drink.  We were in town for only 4 days, and I insisted that we needed to try some fried cheese curd.  Strangely I was never a fan of cheese sticks, but I have to say I sometimes day dream about the fried cheese curd I had at Graze.  My mouth waters thinking about it.  

Graze is local, organic, and sustainable! Yay!  It is also situated across from the capitol building in downtown Madison.  In the evening, the capitol building lights up and creates a beautiful backdrop, which adds to the atmosphere.

Unfortunately I only tried the fried cheese curds.  I'll have to explore the menu more the next time I visit."}
{"text":"I liked Graze, I was not as blown away by it as I had expected which was a little disappointing.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it and would say it is worth the trip!  I do like the focus on supporting local farmers because that is important to me -  the overt way it is advertised in the restaurant is another factor that leads me to believe that Madison is the inspiration for Portlandia and not actually Portland.  Sorry for the sidetrack.....back to Graze. 
 I moved to Madison from Chicago, and found that Graze's menu reminded me of \"some restaurants that I used to know.\".  The menu was a lot like Hearty (where my boyfriend used to work) and I ordered the Steamed Mussels because it seemed similar to the mussels at Hopleaf.  I had orderer's remorse on that one, not because they were not good(they were no Hopleaf mussels), but because I felt like they would have been better as a starter course and not my entree.  wish I could remember what cocktail I had because it was delicious!   We tried the Crawfish Beignets - fabulous.  My boyfriend got the burger which was also great. 
The service was friendly and the ambiance nice - no complaints there!  I am interested to try their brunch menu - overall, I would say give Graze a try!"}
{"text":"Nice space with a fairly helpful staff. Went on a saturday and it was a lot busier than we were looking for. Long wait but found room at the bar. Probably would have stayed if it was not so loud. Hard to have a conversation to the person next to you. So we got appetizers and drinks. both were very good. The deviled eggs are a must try and the salad was very good as well. Might have to try again on a slower evening. I am sure the entrees would have been as good."}
{"text":"My Graze Burger was awesome!
It was a little hard to hear yourself talk.
I will be back in the near future to try more dishes."}
{"text":"Graze is a place I always look forward to going when I'm in Madison. The service and people are wonderful prompt and intelligent. The food is surprisingly scrumptious  at best, and at worst, delicious. It's such a cool space, in such a great area in town wonderful views with surrounding  windows. I've gone 3-4 times with family, every time more warming and memorable than the last . Highly highly recommended. They know how to treat their clients and they know how to make great food and drink. Graze cares for you, I feel obliged to return the sentiment."}
{"text":"The food is 5 stars. The service was decent-lets call it 4. The cocktails were disgusting. I enjoy artisanal beverages-hibiscus bitters can be fun-but should be left to the experts. Today they had a superhero themed cocktail menu which struck me as overplayed. After trying one drink (Hulk-nothing green about it) and not liking it, my wife thought an easier ask might play better and went with a margarita on the rocks with salt. She got tequila on the rocks with a squeeze of half a lime and seltzer. We sent both back and stuck with water thereafter. The oysters were solid. The burger was good, the fries even better and the grits with pulled pork were awesome. We will come back but we'll stick with water."}
{"text":"Went for brunch and was quite pleased with the food and service. I was happy to find vegetarian options, despite advertising themselves as a free-range meat restaurant. The beet salad for brunch is awesome; sounds weird but is really tasty!"}
{"text":"Well...
Graze is good, but not great is the short version. Drinks and appetizers were great, but the entrees were definitely so-so. It was storming when we were there and it was SO cool to be in the space for that, so thumbs up for cool atmosphere. I had heard it was loud in there and that is correct, but not necessarily in a bad way. I had the pork cubed and my favorite part was the crispy kale-- the pork belly was not too good. My food also got cold really quickly and I'm not sure why, but it made the root mash gross fast. Yet another place in Madison where it's all about drinks and apps!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my best friend's birthday here. Had a lovely dinner, delicious drinks, and enjoyed a special treat from our pal back in the kitchen!"}
{"text":"Breakfast outside during farmers market- great people watching , view of the Capitol and awesome breakfast and drinks ! Service is always top notch."}
{"text":"Varied menu but a little bit limited selection, and good atmosphere.  Fresh farm to table. Good bar."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch in downtown Madison. We came on a Sunday afternoon and only waited about 15 minutes to be seated. Their corned beef hash is one of the best I've ever had. They don't skimp on the portions. I had the pancakes and it was more than enough for me. I also ordered a cheese plate which had a truffled cheese something which was excellent (but you can't really go wrong with truffle anything though). The establishment is large, great for groups, lots of bright light. Staff was very friendly and knowledgable."}
{"text":"What a great place to have lunch and I am assuming any meal they will cook for you. The Bibimbap Bowl with tofu was perfect!  The tofu was delicious, firm and in abundance, the crispy rice was cooked to perfection and the bowl had a perfect amount of eat for anyone to enjoy. Not to mention the portion was generous. Eating at a place with all locally sourced ingredients from responsible vendors makes it even better."}
{"text":"Rather underwhelmed by the food here. The atmosphere is trendy and very hipster, somewhat loud. The food is just okay.  

I ordered 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 soup. The minestrone tasted like the pan drippings from a pork roast with some tiny pasta thrown in. The pulled pork Cuban was more like just a plain Cuban, as the pulled pork had very little flavor. 

My husband ordered the Pub burger with fries and a garlic aolie. The fries and sauce were good, but the burger was nothing special."}
{"text":"In so many ways this place was perfect. We had a group of 5 and we all ordered appetizers and different drinks, dinners, and desserts. It way easier for me to say what we didn't like, rather than what we did, because 95% was awesome. My daughter has a type of bratwurst with cream in it that no one at the table enjoyed, but the other sausages we had, including the meat platter was incredible. I had the trout that was spectacular. The other perfect food I had was some type of pecan pie that words cannot describe how amazing it was. I must also make mention of the service, as I had emailed in advance because I have a son with autism. Although they don't take reservation, they made a note of my need and advised me to arrive as close to opening, which we did (amazingly it was already packed). We had a perfect table near the window and my son couldn't have been happier. The server was also fantastic."}
{"text":"Intriguing menu with great options - love the popcorn with SarVecchio cheese on top it's worth the price! House wine is from a tap, quality and made affordable by the lack of bottling driving the cost down. Great place for visitors and locals alike! Madison's finest for sure!"}
{"text":"Really nice place downtown probably Tori Millers best place in Madison based on being a really well rounded restaurant. The prices are really fair for what you are getting, its really high quality food and a nice variety of menu options. And the view is really nice. Prepare to wait for a table if come on a busy night. But you can have dinner at the bar which we have done once and is not a bad option. There isn't a lot of standing room at the bar so hopefully you'll be able to grab a seat.

The bimbimbop is really good, I love the rice cakes they used instead of traditional rice. I've gotten the graze burger twice now. It is probably one of the best burgers in Madison. It does come with a $21 price tag but I think it's worth it.

They have a nice drink menu which is always changing.  Will keep coming back here for yummy food and nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"I love everything about this restaurant.  The owners got it all right, from atmosphere, seasonal punch, appetizers, breakfast pastries, off hours menu, and dessert; I couldn't have come up with a better concept.  

Ok, let me tell you about my favorites!

Breakfast - chocolate crissont
 Lunch- Ramen Noodle Bowl
Appetizer - pickle plate, cheese boards, pork buns, soft pretzel, deviled eggs, oh and the popcorn will truffle oil!!!!
Cocktail - Any seasonal punch, I have tried a cherry brandy, hard cider, and stone fruit
Dinner- Chicken and Waffle or Friday fish Fry
Dessert- any pie-these are the same ones they serve a L'Etolle and they are amazing, but I hate to down play the fresh chocolate chip cookies, cupcakes, or icy with seasonal syrups (I had rhubarb)

Everything is made with exceptional thought and detail.  They pride themselves on local and sustainable.

If you want L'Etoile quality, but lower prices and very relaxed atmosphere, you need to try out Graze."}
{"text":"The Graze Burger is basically a work of culinary art, and their cheese curds are some of the best in town. The food always tastes so fresh and I love that they have a rotating list of local farms that they are collaborating with. The menu is a little pricey but the quality can't be beat."}
{"text":"Service is great, food is greater, only complaint is it's a little too pricey to come as regularly as I want to. I love the brunch there, but I have a bad streak of getting there just late enough for their pacific oysters to sell out."}
{"text":"Fun restaurant on the square. Get the liter of wine from the cask. Popcorn appetizer great. Had the burger on an English muffin. Very good. Fries excellent. Several odd entree items. Very noisy though."}
{"text":"I was having a hard time deciding how many stars to give Graze - 3 or 4. 

The restaurant is very open and beautiful inside. We were sat at a table with a great view of the Capital building which also made it a great place to people watch. 

I completely agree with other reviewers on their cheese curds. You GOTTA give them a try. They taste so freshly made and the sauce they come with also adds some yumminess! These beat out the curds at Craftsman by far! (Sorry Craftsman!). 

I ordered the Bibimbap even though I read some negative reviews about it. It came beautifully presented in a bowl, and I was really excited to dig in. The rice comes in rectangular blocks that are flash fried. This gives the crisp you would normally get from the rock cooker. You have to mix everything up well to get a bite of the variety of veggies and flavors in the bowl. You can immediately tell the veggies are fresh with the satisfying crunch. Every bite had a good crunch to it with either carrots, cucumbers, Kim chee, or radishes. Initially, the dish was very tasty but it soon got overwhelmingly salty to the point where I couldn't taste anything but salt. Thinking back, I think this is due to the gochuchang sauce. If I decided to try it again, I would get the sauce on the side. 

All of the staff were polite and helpful in explaining the dishes to us newbies. 

Overall, I recommend coming here. I may not recommend the Bibimbap but definitely enjoy their cheese curds"}
{"text":"Finally got to try Graze after a very long period of anticipation. Everyone kept telling me about them and they look quite inviting from the Capitol Square when you're walking by at the Farmer's Market.

Well they did not disappoint.  My wife and I had a wonderful date night out here on a Thursday night.  No wait, got a booth, relaxed social atmosphere, excellent food.  She had the Pub burger while I went with the Graze burger.  I was a little sticker shocked at the $21 price tag compared to her more down-to-earth one, but oooh-weee was it good.  Ribs, Sirloin, Bacon, Onions, Butter, and Brioche?  Yes Please!  And the fries were equally tasty, quite possibly some of the best in Madison.  They had a fantastic balance of being slightly soggy/greasy while still being crispy and overall scrumptious.  We also ordered the famous cheese curds and they were a must have too.

Trading bites with her, I liked the Pub burger as well.  I think you could make this a reasonable place to eat on a regular basis downtown if you don't go H.A.M. on the wine and signature item like we did.  I mean, they have a killer bread basket, and that alone gets A+ status in my book.

Service was friendly, but a little bit of going through the motions.  I felt a little out of place there as our server wasn't too talkative, but with the combo of great food, a good price, and everyone around you talking/laughing/enjoying themselves, it's definitely a place to be.  I will be returning soon and am eager to sample their interesting and expansive cuisine.

And I woulda snapped a pic of the food, but I remembered as I was mid-bite with that giant sandwich of the gods.  Peace be with you, lovely burger."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this and it is pretty darn good!!

I had the Bibimbap and wifey had the Signature Grave burger. Both outstanding. Would happily eat both again. Service was great too.

Only downside was the drinks. Had a craft cocktail and wasn't thrilled with it. Next time I might be as adventurous in that dept. 

It's worth a trip here"}
{"text":"Best cheese curds in Madison. Hands down.
Best brunch in Madison??? Perhaps!

Man, I'm lovin me that fried chicken and waffle. Chicken. Waffle. Perfection.

But dude the seasonal fruit pancakes with apple cherry compote and cinnamon butter....umm, I'll take an extra order to go...

If you're feeling traditional, don't worry you can get your eggs and bacon. Uh huh."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were visiting family in Madison about a month ago, found this place walking around the Capitol building. We had a great experience! The food was awesome- we had the cheese curds, deviled eggs, ramen, and shrimp Po' boy. All were delicious! The staff was very friendly, specially our server Kyle! I commend him for sitting through my dude's endless jokes and stories, even more so for responding with equal humor and wit. I highly recommend Graze- the quality of their food is excellent, and the vibe is welcoming and down to earth. We will definitely stop by on our next visit!"}
{"text":"Excellent food made with local ingredients.  It's a good place to have a fancy dinner or a semi-casual brunch.  Dinner is a little expensive, but brunch is affordable.  I would recommend the Nutella French toast for brunch.  Really cool atmosphere and great view of the Capitol."}
{"text":"Yummy! I liked how all of the ingredients were from local farmers. I tried the pork bibimbap. Very good. Large portion but veggies were crisp. I appreciated their American fusion of this dish. Also, I tried the mac with pulled pork. That was delicious. It was hard for me to focus on my meal when the cheesy goodness smell of the mac kept wafering near me. Nice open atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is amazing and worth the wait - especially if you get the cheese curds and the famous graze burger and the chicken and waffles! 

Just don't get the gnocchi unless you like soggy mash-potato balls with bland sauce on top. 

Everything else was amazing. Especially the drinks and cocktails"}
{"text":"Still have nothing bad to say about this place.  Went there last night.  I got the Pork Cubed.  It was delicious.  The pork belly in broth with udon noodles was a little too fatty.  But everything else was awesome.  My date had the best dish though.  The meatloaf open faced sandwich was outta sight!  Really awesome.  Bailey's cheesecake was solid as well."}
{"text":"My co worker and I arrived in Madison, Wisconsin and were in need of dinner. Our hotel concierge recommended Graze as the go to restaurant. It is his absolute favorite. So we decided what the heck, if it's Jason's favorite we will try it!we arrived to the restaurant after a brisk walk and were pleasantly surprised as we walked in. The menu offered a farm to table selection of foods. We decided to start off the meal with fried cheese curds. This is a typical Wisconsin appetizer and I figured when in Rome! The cheese curds were fabulous! The were warm cheesy balls of goodness with a delectable dipping sauce. For my main dish I ordered the trout. The trout arrived very warm with a cold relish on top. It also included a hearty side of farro. My meal exceeded my expectations. The server was nice and attended to us when necessary. The ambiance was hip and updated feel. Great experience overall!"}
{"text":"Great upscale place with a lot of food and cocktails. Best looking restaurant in Madison. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to impress someone on their first visit to Madison. The creative take on cheese curds is a respite from the mundane greasy kind that plague the streets of Madison in the name of tradition."}
{"text":"This place offers the best view and good food. While I appreciate their wide range of menu selection, I am not sure what their specialty is, as they have burgers and ramen on their menu.
 I've come here for brunch and dinner. First time I ordered their pancake, I was a bit surprised to have a fried chicken side by side with my pancake. Each was good but not sure when they are together in one dish. 
In all, our eating experiences here have never been bad. The waitresses/waiters are always nice and helpful and never forget to fill in our glasses."}
{"text":"Fresh. Local. Seasonal. Delicious!

Graze is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. I love the emphasis on supporting local farmers and using fresh ingredients.

The food is flavorful and nicely plated. Everything I've tried has been great. The burger is juicy and delicious.  The bibimbap was superb and spicy. Every bite is like a party in your mouth!  

The drinks here are amazing! My favorite drink at the moment is the springing in the rain drink. The cucumber is very refreshing.

This is also a great place for brunch. The scramblers are delicious, and the Bloody Mary's are loaded with goodies!"}
{"text":"We stopped for lunch recently and both the food and service were great.  The Koben, a Ruben with a Korean twist, was superb.  Graze never disappoints."}
{"text":"Great environment, gotta wait though!
Love their cheese curds!
A very different way of preparing food - it was definitely unique to my taste buds!"}
{"text":"I was here with a group of friends this summer on my first tour around Madison. We went around 3.30 pm on a Saturday after going to the farmers marker and going round and round in Madison so we got the other hours menu. Ordered the pickle board and veg bibimbap. Loved it!!!! Absolutely loved it!!!! I don't care about the place being pricey. We shared the bibimbap between two people and we were both full and couldn't finish it. The food was amazing!!!! And the first time I ever tried the spotted cow and loved that too!"}
{"text":"Graze Restaurant in Madison, WI, is simply amazing!  All local farmer supplied ingredients from sustainable sources. For dinner for three every item ordered had something spectacular about it.   Beautiful glass-walled venue on the Capitol Square across from the Capitol Dome which is quite beautiful lit up at night. If ever in Madison, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I have been here for lunch twice and brunch once. Both lunches I have had the same dish--the smoked tofu wrap. I think there might be other vegan-friendly ones on the menu but I can't be sure. Anyway, the wrap is very good, even when you get it vegan with mustard instead of mayo. They do something to the tofu that makes it authentically smoky and delicious. Other than the wow factor of the tofu the rest of the meal is very much good but not great. But that's kind of Graze's deal--basic food done well with a consistent locavore ethic. 

Brunch was much better than lunch, however. The scrambled tofu ranks high, even though as a vegan in Madison I am a little sick of that being my only option at most places for brunch. Regardless, it is very good (the sauce was spicy and savory and oh so-delicious). It was served with an abundant bed of fresh greens with a simple and satisfying vinaigrette. The potatoes, were the stars of the meal, however (as they are with all breakfast dishes done proper). Very crispy and salty. 

I paired this with a local craft brew (some kind of Rye APA). 

Graze is a standby in my eating out rotation. It is fancy enough to go for a business lunch, yet laid back enough to take your mom out for a nice brunch.  Their food is simple but tasty. And in a foodie-centric culture where excess and experimentation are sometimes a little overpowering, that's a good thing."}
{"text":"If you are vegetarian, Graze's menu may have seemed tricky in the past, but they have introduced a number of veggie options on their new menu, so it's now easy to enjoy a small plate festival alongside fabulous cocktails in what I consider one of the most fab dining spaces to be dining in. You can graze upon amazing, well-prepared food while gazing upon the capitol, imagining a world without Republicans running everything into the ditch.

We love the fact that Graze, like Chef Tory's other restaurants, celebrates local farms from cheese to veg. 
It's a fabulous dynamic, and we are happy to enjoy local ingredients that are lovingly prepared any time we decide to eat out.

If you are super cool, you will want to be in Trevor's section. He is an amazing waiter, and has served our table on previous visits, and somehow remembered us tonight, even though our last visit was many months ago. He knows the menu inside out, and will make excellent suggestions. If Trevor is taking care of your table, consider yourself lucky and tip him accordingly.

Even though it's been a long time since our first visit to Graze, I have to mention that the highlight of our first visit was the roasted, glazed Brussels sprouts offered on the menu that night. Those sprouts were the first and only time I've ever liked, no, loved them, despite my many previous attempts. I've also quite enjoyed the Bimibap, though I cannot abide the egg involved. I don't care what the people say: a fried egg is gross, and a soft yolk is even worse. Get it without the egg, but do get it with the tofu. 

Tonight we tried a few of the newer items on the menu. The carrot hummus! Get it, eat it, love it! The compote on top with the harissa--so yummy. We both loved their version of naan with avocado in the batter. It's surprising that the green color survives the cooking and it's super thin and crisp and tender and the richness of the avocado was not lost. Someone let us know if they decide to supersize this dish, because we could eat all of it. Seriously, we want to know. I'd also accept a number of the tiny cast-iron ramekins they serve it in.

We also had the cherry and beet salad, and as a couple of vegetarians who think beets taste like dirt, this is a gateway dish for beet enjoyment. Get a bite with cherry, a nice slab of beet, arugula and the nuts and it is super yummy. The beets on their own still taste like dirt, but that is the nature of a beet. It's good to know that they can actually taste good in concert with other flavors, finally.

As an experiment, we both tried a vegetarian version of the double smash cheeseburger with the \"impossible burger\" we've been reading about for some time. It's eerily burger like, and it was fun and indulgent to find that the stuff dripping down our hands was the house special sauce and the juice from the fabulous tomato and not the burger itself. The bun is soft, light and perfect as a burger bun. I covet the recipe. The tomato is super flavorful and juicy. Eating this burger was disturbingly enjoyable. 

Tonight was the latest in a strung-out series of wonderful meals, great cocktails and excellent service at this restaurant. If you have a bad dining experience here, it's probably your fault."}
{"text":"Very few places get 5 stars from me, but I could find absolutely nothing wrong with this place.  They had a drink special of Rhubarb puree with simple syrup, gin, vodka and lemon. It was really good and refreshing.  We had an order of deep fried pickles, that were the best I have ever eaten.  For dinner I had the lake perch, and again some of the best.  Our waitress was perfect...attentive, but not overbearing.  Unfortunately, we were too full for dessert.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ok, I gave Graze a 4 because for brunch, they're probably about a 3. But the Graze burger is a surefire 5. I'd skip brunch here and just save room for dinner. The graze burger is honestly one of the better things I've ever tasted.I mean.....

fresh ground bacon, sirloin, ribeye & short ribs, caramelized onions, Worcestershire-cabernet jus, Swiss Emmental compound butter, SarVecchio sesame brioche, with fries & aioli (Modify to GF/DF)

For brunch, I was fooled into getting the pub burger, thinking it was the Graze burger. DO NOT MAKE THIS MISTAKE. The pub burger is just a burger. The Graze burger is otherworldly. The beet salad is also really nice. The curds are probably top 5 curds in Madison, and I LOVE the truffle popcorn.

Ok so for brunch, I've had the chicken fried steak, and others have gotten the pub burger and the corned beef hash. All of them were pretty good, but the portions aren't too large. The chicken fried steak is definitely a favorite of mine, but I wouldn't hate if it were a little bigger.

It's pretty tough to get a table at Graze- you should always have someone go at least 30 minutes ahead of when you want to be seated to put in your name (they don't take call ahead reservations). One nice thing is that they'll take your number and text you when your table is ready, so you can explore the area around the capitol while you wait. Also the people-watching from the tables is top-notch. I usually will wait a few more minutes to be seated against the windows. Last thing is that the wait staff comes off as a little pretentious... I've found that it's very hit or miss. Sometimes we'll get someone really relatable and nice, and other times there will be people that I imagine rolling their eyes at me as soon as they turn around. Also what's up with the tiny dishes of ketchup?! I'll take the full bottle, please."}
{"text":"Oh My Land - the Sunday brunch here is amazing. We sat at the bar, because they are quite busy. Loved the service and attention here. We both had their banger breakfast with eggs. Zesty sausages with a nice scrub of toast and eggs. The Magic Coffee is absolutely fantastic - spicy, creamy, rich coffee. Yum. Their cocktails are quite good, and again - the service was dynamite."}
{"text":"A big fan or Tory Miller and what he's done for the Madison foodie scene, I was pumped when he opened this place!  Killer spot on the square with awesome views and fresh urban \"farm to table\" type decor.  The focus is just good quality seasonal food!  We had the pickle sampler for an appetizer and it was fantastic, inventive, and fun.  The graze burger was out of this world, and I had the pulled pork macaroni and cheese which was equally amazing.  The last time we visited I felt like they were short staffed so I will give them a little lee-way on timely service, but the quality was there.  The bartenders are always great with an ever changing drink menu...and the bar area is a great place to see and be seen!"}
{"text":"This place is a Madison standout in my mind. The burger is without a doubt in Madison's top three (best in my opinion), and the drink selection is ample. It is on the steeper side price-wise but the value is good. The vegetarian options are especially tasty as well. It is also very \"homegrown\" (locally sourced), almost to the point of being Portlandia-local."}
{"text":"When in Wisconsin, you got to try the cheese curds. So when I yelped amd it was proclaimed that the \"Old Fashioned\" restaurant had the best cheese curds in Madison, I was really sad that I was informed that the wait was 45-minutes. So instead, I walked a block down to Graze, also supposedly having one of the best cheese curds in Madison.

So much going on on the menu... it was so hard to decide on what to order. Soooo, I ordered several items: 

* Fried cheese curds, of course! It had the perfect amount of breading and was pretty tasty. The sauce that came with it, I could live without, but overall, the appetizer was nice and flaky. 

* Biscuits and gravy were the really good. There was a lot of gravy, but it wasn't overpowering. The chicken strips that came on top of the dish was a great touch and the combo of gravy, chicken strips, and biscuits were great.

* Chicken and waffles. A large drumstick and wing. Breading was excellent. The waffle that it sat on top of was soft and fluffy. You can't beat the combo of syrup, waffle, and fried chicken. The cinnamon butter that came with it, I could do without as well. But overall, the best part, much like the fried cheese curds, was the breading. This place sure got its breading down!

BATHROOM REVIEW: one unisex bathroom at the bottom, main bathrooms upstairs. Two urinals one stall. Stall seemed clean. I asked the dude coming up sit or squat and he looked at me funny. The price I'm willing to pay, to let yall know about them bathrooms."}
{"text":"So I've waited to post this update post menu revision, because they've been changing things up.  I feel like that's stopped so it's time to talk.  First, why did you feel the need to mess with the perfection of your hash browns? The new ones are ok, but nowhere near your previous version. Same thing with the sausage.  Like a pale, bland, 3D printed version of the original.

And about taking away biscuits and gravy and beignets from my Saturday morning routine. Not happy.

I know change is hard, but I have several friends that frequent, and we don't have anything positive to say about the new menu. 

My only hope is that enough people agree and will speak up.  Still love you, but thinking about alternatives for our weekly Farmers market stop for breakfast."}
{"text":"A Madison staple and common stop for dignitaries, Graze is perfectly located in the shadow of the State Capitol building on the square, downtown. Living up to its Madisonian roots, this place paves the way in farm-to-table cuisine and has unique menu items with sometimes unusual twists. 

Menu
The menu is hit or miss for my own tastes, but when it's a hit it's really a hit. They have, hands down, the best Mac and Cheese I've ever had...Thick, tangy sauce on nice big shells, and for an extra bit of something good you can get BBQ pork or sliced kielbasa on top. My second favorite is the bibimbap. They also have some of the best cheese curds in town which is important in Wisconsin. Finally...the pork belly rolls...woah. 

Price
Price is reasonable for what you get. Some portions are a little small, especially the appetizers. But the entrees will fill you up. 

Atmosphere
Attire is whatever you'd like. People wear everything from business casual to jeans and t-shirts. My only gripe (other than the fact they don't put ice in your water) is that it's too \"Madisony\". If you're from out of town you'll know what I mean right away- hipsters abound!"}
{"text":"I had the Cuban sandwich and soup for lunch.  The soup was curry parsnip with shrimp ceviche, which was fantastic.  The sandwich was also good, but the highlight for me was the soup.  I also got the specialty lemonade and it was also very good.

The service was fine, but the food took a while to arrive.  Considering it was busy it wasn't a big deal.

My only complaint and it's a minor one is that there was not free refills on the specialty lemonade. It was good."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots when I am craving a burger, if I'm in the area! I've been to Madison 3 times for work and I always make a stop at the Graze for the \"Graze Burger\" - $22. The patty is always moist and flavorful. The side of fries is also great with the aioli sauce. With a few glasses of beer, it will leave your tummy smiling. They have happy hour where you get a buy one, get one off their beer selection. I tried a few, but my favorite beer there is the Potosi Snake Hollow. When I was at the bar, I was told that the chef also works at the L'Etoile restaurant which is very high end. So expect the Graze to have that top quality food for reasonable prices. The service is amazing! They make be slower during rush hour, but when they do stop by, they are always very friendly. When I hear that my coworkers are heading to Madison for work, I always recommend a stop at the Graze for dinner! The next time I am at Madison, I'll be sure to stop by again!"}
{"text":"I go here for brunch with my husband at least once a month, and we've gone several times for dinner. Since they don't take reservations, there is oftentimes a wait, but it's worth it (and not so bad if you plan ahead). Everything I've had is delicious, and I love their cocktails. My husband loves their bloody marys."}
{"text":"I live in the Chicagoland area, so whenever I'm in Madison, GRAZE IS A MUST STOP! everything from their oysters to cocktails are fantastic. I just tried their pork belly buns....I had to reorder them because holy shit...so amazing. Love this place and nothing bad to say!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend on a Thursday.  The food was really good.  I got a turkey sandwich, which had really great flavor.  Unfortunately this place gets only 3 stars from me due to service.  The waitress came to our table and didn't even look at me.  I'm not sure why she did this since most waitresses look at each member of the party and lets them decide who wants to order first.  So my friend ordered and then I ordered, asking specifically for no tomatoes.  I repeated it 2-3 times to make sure she heard me.  Sandwiches came out and mine had huge tomatoes on them so I had to take them out.  It's not that I'm allergic or anything, but I just don't prefer them and I would rather not waste them by having to pick them out of my sandwich.  The waitress did not come back AT ALL to see how we were doing.  My soda ran out about halfway through the meal and she did not come by until at least 3/4 of the way through the meal, asking if I'd like a refill.  So I said yes, and didn't receive the soda until we were paying the bill.  The whole time she was setting tables nearby us as if I had not asked for a refill at all.  I don't mind if it takes a bit longer if the place is crazy packed and busy, but by that time, the lunch rush had been over and there were no additional diners waiting to be seated.  She was just kind of snobby, in my opinion.  Maybe because I looked like I didn't have a lot of money?  I don't know.  I'd like to give this place a shot again; I just hope we get better service next time!"}
{"text":"IWe love the local organic stuff.  Dishes and flavors were excellent.  We had some sort of kimchi and pulled pork mac & cheese. Both were excellent, and surprisingly complimentary.  It's nice when the kitchen knows what it's doing.  Excellent  server too."}
{"text":"I look forward to going to Madison so I can stop by Graze. Delicious cheese, booze, and all other locally-sourced edibles makes this one of my favorite spots anywhere, not just in Madison. Maybe it's because I'm not from Wisconsin and I enjoy hearing someone say \"this is one of the top-10 cheeses of the year\" but I can't get enough of this place."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference, and found myself here...

Oh, this itched the right spot on my stomach-heart!

But first... avoid the regular burger. Because it's good. But honestly... the english muffin bun is lacking. And then you will also try your friend's GRAZE burger... and nothing will be the same! This is what happened to me!

THE GRAZE BURGER IS AMAZING. it tastes LIKE A FREAKING STEAK, but in juicy burger, sandwhiched form! oh MAN it was like I could TASTE the cow in this burger. 

Also, I was on a fried cheese curd kick. And definitely the BEST fried cheese curd I've had in downtown madison!

Beer selection here is excellent too!"}
{"text":"I tried the noodle bowl here and was disappointed. It wasn't worth the price for what I got. The noodles were maybe a little overcooked or just too soft.

I might come back here to try another item on the menu next time since I did like the environment."}
