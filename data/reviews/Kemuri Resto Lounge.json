{"text":"This place is awful. The music was obnoxiously loud. The service was terrible, I had to wait over 50 mins for my sushi and that was on a day where the place was almost empty. We ended up leaving because I couldn't hear the person sitting in front of me and the food was taking way more than it should have. Also very expensive food for what it really is."}
{"text":"It's time to buck the bad vibes trend that seems to be plaguing Kemuri Resto Lounge. As someone else mentioned, \"where-else are you getting Sushi and Shisha all in the same place?\". 

Now like a lot of other Shisha/hookah joints, Kemuri is a place that you gotta know about in order to find (or just use Yelp to give you directions), as it's in a bit of an industrial plaza space right off of Hwy 7 in Concord (think about where that McDonalds is at Hwy 7 and Centre street and just go a bit east.

Once you've arrived it's easy to find and when you walk inside you literally have the option of \"smoking or non-smoking\" meaning, you can go into the mostly enclosed Shisha lounge side OR sit just outside of it if your plan is to dine on sushi and have non-alcoholic drinks (coffee, tea, pop, juice, water, etc).

Now, admittedly, I did not partake in the sushi options as my friend and I were there for the shisha and some good conversation. So I'll need to reserve my 5th star for the day that I decide to give their food a try.

In terms of Shisha, this place is LEGIT. Full marks all the way through. Creative shisha blends (ask for the RICK ROSS inspired one - blueberry, pomegranate, vanilla, unique base offerings (like milk or redbull), and tons of head options (Orange, grapefruit, watermelon, etc) and even a unique premium coal which I'd never had before - coconut coal.

The result of our RICK ROSS flavour in an orange head, with milk base and coconut coals was a super thick and smooth smoke that lasted well over 2 hours! Also for those that don't know all those things added together make for a BOUGIE AF Shisha smoke, it was basically the Rolls Royce of shisha.

The last thing worth mentioning was the excellent service. Met the owner, Harris, and he was super accommodating, made excellent recommendations, and just generally took great care of us, giving us an upgrade to the coconut coals to try, and consistently checking on our Orange head and coals to ensure we had enough and that our smoke wasn't too harsh.

Great spot, ignore the low reviews, for shisha in a lounge environment (which means loud music... so get over it) this is a great option in Vaughan!"}
{"text":"I came in with high expectations because c'mon.. sushi AND shisha!? That's my two favourite things in one! But then I thought about it.. how good could the sushi be if there's shisha as well? And I was right.

The place itself is pretty nice. Nice decor, good vibes, a little dimmed lighting - nice. The servers were pretty friendly as well! When we sat down, the music started blasting in our ears (but it wasn't terrible to the point where I couldn't hear my friend). We waited an extremely long time for the food and when it came out... well.... I feel like the only ingredient they knew how to use was spicy mayo. If you call spicy mayo drenched on top and inside a roll, sushi, then come here by all means!

I can tolerate extremely spicy foods but this was beyond spicy! The Kemuri fries were alright, $10 for a plate of decent fries with chicken and a looooooootttttt of spicy mayo... the shisha was decent quality but was semi overpriced at $16.

My friend and I thought the prices reflected the area, being in a higher income neighbourhood. But at least match the quality with the price..
Not too sure if I would come back."}
{"text":"I like that the shisha isn't overpriced like most places in the area. Weekdays are usually not busy so it's a chill place to go if you just want to vibe and smoke with friends. Casual and relaxed spot. Weekends are really busy and lit, best to go before the club. The servers are really friendly and remember their regulars! The decor is trendy and urban. Overall my favourite spot in the area"}
{"text":"This place is a rip off, we went in thinking it's cool to smoke and have some food. Half the stuff on the menu is not available, we ordered the chicken fries and it came freezing cold, the sushi is horrible. The waitress over charged us because he was rounding up all the prices in his head. Paid 50 bucks for 2 plates of fries and 6 pieces of taco sushi. The only thing is good about the place is the music that's about it. Save your money and go somewhere else. Everything in the men washroom is falling apart ( even the door ) let's hope you don't need to use the washroom when you are there lol."}
