{"text":"Authentic Southern food. There's a lot of pride here, and for a good reason. Everything is prepared carefully and with a lot of flavor.

The dining room is nothing fancy, but they serve great food with a smile. 

I'm very particular about my cornbread, because Southern cornbread is never sweet. The cornbread here is only slightly sweet, and it's a good portion for just 50Â¢.

The BBQ sauce is excellent, although it would be nice to have a few more options or spice level. 

The greens were perfect.  Overall, wonderful Southern BBQ."}

Well, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE PLACES!!!  The food is simply amazing. Definitely what the area needed. This is definitely a,\" could be dinner every night place\"."}
