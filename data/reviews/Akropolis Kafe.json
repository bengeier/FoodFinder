{"text":"This place is great. It's very nice on the inside. The food is very good and seems like it should cost more. The only disappointment for me was the styrofoam plates. But I think that goes with the cheap prices."}
{"text":"To the ever so pleasant, disinterested child working tonight. You are rude, you are inaccurate and give horrible customer service. The puss face, nasty toned lady on the food side - smiling is free and so is preparing an order THE WAY IT'S ORDERED. To the owner- these two people are hurting your business and I will never return to your establishment.  

I have been here many many times before tonight. I live steps away from Zetouni and I like different items on the menu from each. The staff at zetouni is pleasant, attentive and efficient. 

There were 2 tables of 2 when I came in. The teenager working doesn't say hello, doesn't look up at you. As she's looking at her phone says \"what do you want to order\". RUDE. I ordered one of the specials for the night. Gyro sandwich and SALAD. Fine. Seems easy enough for a Greek restaurant no? I nicely asked for extra tomatoes and onions. The nasty lady behind the counter gave me a dirty look as soon as she heard it. Fine. 

10 mins go by as I watch the child working stomp her feet around the restaurant in her leggings and Tshirt - very professional. My food is ready and again, without looking up, \"utensils?\"  I reply \"no thank you, may I have some tatziki sauce on the side. The nasty one in the back chimes in \"that'll be 70 cents\". The child proceeds to turn to me and for the first time actually looks me in the eye \"it's 70 cents\". The lady in the back will not hand her the sauce yet. Fine. 

I only had a debit card on me so that's what I handed her. SEVENTY CENTS. she swiped my card for seventy cents. Good luck with that credit card processing fee owner!!! I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this. She slaps the receipt and my card on the counter, nasty in the back hands her the sauce. She puts it on the counter and walks away. 

I am really not a difficult customer nor do I expect anything I don't pay for or deserve. That being said WHEN I ORDER AND PAY FOR SALAD IT'S MIND BLOWING THAT I GET HOME TO FREAKING FRENCH FRIES. ?????

What gives here? It's a shame because the food is actually good. Which is why I gave the extra star but after my experience today- whether they care or not - they have lost me as a customer. 

It really is too bad because there used to be a very sweet lady running the counter who couldn't have been nicer. 

I don't need to drive out of my way to be treated like a second class citizen bothering nasty people who are being PAID to be there and provide customer service. 

Will not ever go or recommend again. Your loss. No thank you. Hope your seventy cents came in handy."}
{"text":"Great place to eat Greek food. Very friendly staff. Great food at very great prices. The whole restaurant is very clean. Awesome place to have lunch."}
{"text":"Great Greek food.  I like their gyros more than the ones at the Yiasou festival."}
{"text":"Best Greek chicken salad in Charlotte.  Eat it a lot.  Plus used this company to cater a 22 person lunch.  It was perfect.  You should give them a try."}
{"text":"Nice little Greek restaurant and take out. They don't have a large selection but what they have is pretty good (and actually pretty close to real Greek food). I usually go there if I'm in the neighbirhood and need a quick bite for lunch. Most of the time I get some sort of Kebab with Greek salad. It's always fresh and nicely seasoned. The interior is nothing to write home about, not inviting you to spend a lot of time there. But hey: if you're in the mood for some good (cheap) Greek food this is a good place to get it."}
{"text":"Awesome gyros and if you are wanting great fries this is the place to go!  They have the best fries in town."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch -  Food to good and the combo's come with fries or salad.  Salad dressing and sauces are yummy."}
{"text":"The place is VERY clean.  It's the type of place where you order off the menu which is listed above the cash register and they bring the food to you.  The hummus was probably the best hummus I've ever had at a restaurant.  I ordered a Gyro & Greek salad for my meal.  The gyro was so delicious-had green peppers, onions, feta cheese, and yogurt sauce on it.  Probably my favorite gyro as well.  The salad was fresh and good-just a little too vingerage-y for my taste though. the prices were good and the food was great!!"}
{"text":"Amazing stuffed grape leaves and chicken sandwhich!!! First Mediterranean place I've found since I moved from DC. Service was fast and friendly. My kind of place. I'll be back next week!!!"}
{"text":"The service is great - the manager (possibly the owner), is friendly. I ordered a falafel wrap and was very disappointed. The flavor was bland and there was an \"old grease\" taste to the food. The salad was all ice burg lettuce with soggy tomatoes. Sorry, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was not as good as I had hoped. I ordered the Spanakopita and they were soggy. I expected crunchy and flaky and was sadly disappointed. Baklava was tasty but not the best"}
{"text":"Has this place taken on new management?  I went recently and it was not even close to what it was a year or so ago.  I was just a little disappointed.  I had the Gyro and it was bland and had no crisp to it.  I used to love this place. I'm hoping it was just a 1 time thing."}
{"text":"I just had medical procedure done around the area because I'm so hungry we just found this place and it is not ready for lunch we waited 15 mins I ordered the #18 chicken kabob it's bland and dry I'm so disappointed. But my husband ordered #20 kobideh kabob and that one was tasty, we wouldn't go back coz it is far anyways."}
{"text":"Great little casual joint that serves up good Greek salads, chicken kabobs, etc.   They are super quick, which is nice when you are busy.  As the other reviewers have mentioned, the place is nice and clean and service is friendly.  Definitely a great go-to place for a quick & affordable lunch."}
{"text":"We love Middle Eastern and Greek food, so were anxious to try this place since it offers both.  It occupies a typical strip mall type space, so is very casual in atmosphere, however there's a very nice patio outside not too far away (shared) that has Tiki umbrellas.  There was also one table with a red umbrella right outside.  Ordering is at the counter.  My husband ordered the gyro/souvlaki combo plate, choosing tenderloin for the souvlaki that comes with fries & a Greek salad.  I ordered the Koobideh kabob special dish, that is served with rice & a Greek salad, but opted to forgo the rice & double the salad.  When the cashier asked our drink order, we said we didn't want anything to drink at all, but waters were delivered to our table anyway.  They brought chicken souvlaki instead of what he ordered.  (He just kept it.).  All 3 the meats were over cooked.  The gyro chicken had good flavor, but was so dry that even the yogurt sauce provided couldn't make up for it.  The ground beef (koobideh) kabob was so over cooked/dried out, that I didn't eat it.  My husband said his fries were greasy.  We both had the Greek salad.  It was iceberg lettuce with a couple Greek olives, pickled banana pepper slices, a small slice of a small tomato, & a dusting of feta cheese fine crumbs.  The dressing only tasted of vinegar, although there were dark herbs in it.  Conclusion:  Each if our meals were $10.95.  We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Good food. Quick service. Nice staff. Decent selection of menu items.

I'll be coming again."}
{"text":"First time here, just got two gyros with salad. Everything was very good, meat did not seem \"microwaved\" and the pita was soft and slightly crispy. Salad was fresh. The woman behind the counter and the one who served us couldn't have been nicer, coming to check on us a few times.  Finally, my SO wanted some more pita and tzatziki,  went to order it and they gave him a couple w/sauce on the house.  Maybe the place was just having a bad day when the very unhappy reviewer visited?  They seemed very friendly and competent tonight and the food was very good.  Will def be back."}
{"text":"I discovered Akropolis Kafe during my first week at my new job.  I'm glad I did.  The inside is pretty plain, but since the place strikes me as being a quick lunch spot for office workers more than anything else, that's not surprising.  You don't have time to linger on your lunch hour, anyways.

Anyways, I order the gyro with a side salad.  They gyro was very good, perhaps one of the best I've had in Charlotte outside the Greek Festival.  The meat was well-seasoned and juicy, with just a hint of char.  Mmm.  The salad was a little more disappointing: as others have mentioned, they ladle way too much dressing on that sucker.  Next time, I'll order fries or ask for the dressing on the side.

I definitely recommend Akropolis for a quick lunch, and I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Small place. Looks like Family place with around 10-12 tables. No hostess order on front and choose a table to sit. Before food to arrive I guess the owner cane and asked me to move to a smaller table. During whole time only 3 table where busy.   Ordered a Gyro plate it came with fries salad gyro on side two small pieces pita bread and tzatziki sauce and salad dressing. 
Gyro was good,fries dry and over fried.  Side salad green salad with one olive one cucumber and one tomato slice.one half slice red onion. Ordered tee with lemon it came with no lemon.  
For me is OK"}
{"text":"Loved the food, I had a super gyro, my mom had chicken souvlaki shishkabob sandwich and my husband had the mushroom cheeseburger on pita bread. Everything was excellent. All the meat was very tender. We went during lunch and they were busy but fast. We will be back. Everything was great!"}
{"text":"I just moved to the Charlotte area from Greensboro last week. In Greensboro, my favorite place to have lunch was/is Ghassan's on Battleground Ave.  For one, the food is consistently good.  I always get the chickon on pita platter, fries and salad (or sometimes, all salad- but at least they give you a choice).  I will have to do a review of Ghassan's on Battleground Ave. because I could go on and on about how great they are (fast, consistent, friendly,realy delicious etc.).  So, in need of something to remind me of home, I went to Akropolis in Ballantyne just up the street from my work.  The service was not as fast as my dear, sweet Ghassan's.  The menu was a little confusing, as I was looking for my old standby, so I asked they guy at the counter what would be a chicken on pita- he said it was the sandwich.  He asked if I wanted fries OR salad.  When I said both, he said I could only have one with the plate and would have to order one of them seperately... gasp!  Ghassan's always lets you have both!!!  So, I ordered the salad with the box and got a separate order of fries.  It was a lot of fries.  The pita was good, but not the best I've ever had.   The pita wasn't as fluffy and warm and the chicken at Akropolis is not as tender as Ghaassans (sorry- if I could move Gassans to Ballantyne, I would!). The tzatziki sauce was $.65 extra but it's some of the best I've tried. The tea is sweet, but that's how I like it.  The fries are big, thick steak fries (I prefer crinkle). The Greek salad is wide cut iceburg lettuce (I like the stingy kind better), a peice of red onion, a couple grape tomoatoes, a cucumber, I sliver of green pepper, one seeded kalamata olive, a tiny bit of feta, and on the side you get ample olive oil vinagarette, which they make too tart and peppery for my taste (too vinegarey, if that's a word).  I put some of the cucumber sauce in my salad to take the tartness off and will probably do that every time. The salad was ok, not outstanding, but fresh.  I'd like it cut up more, but, hey, they did give me a plastc fork and knife. The prices were very good. I did not eat in, but I did use the ladies room while waiting for my order.  It's very clean.  That always is a good sign that the kitchen is clean.  You can actually see the cook from the counter.  It all looks well maintained.    I would eat there again, but I still long for Ghassan's on Battleground Ave. If you're ever in Greensboro, you have go there.  Akropolis is not bad, but I wouldn't say they are great.  They are decent, reasonably priced, and their tzatziki sauce has it going on!  ...oh, and a little stingy on the ketchup for all those fries (just sayin').  Guess they have high rent in Ballantyne and have to control costs, which is understandible.  LOL"}
{"text":"I went for a lunch at this place and ordered grilled chicken kabob wrap. It's really tasty.
Looks like lamb kabob with yellow rice also good.i will revisit again try some other items."}
{"text":"The food was good and the gentleman behind the counter was friendly and efficient. Started with the hummus appetizer which was served with piping hot pita bread. Hummus was flavorful but not extraordinary and I wish they had served more pita bread with it. The gyros were full of meat with a flavorful tzatziki sauce. The main reason I gave them 3 stars is because the ketchup bottles which were on the tables were filthy. We were one of the first customers, if not the first customers of the day so no excuse for dirty condiments. Details are important especially when it comes to cleanliness."}
{"text":"The food was decent for a quick lunch spot. The price is ok but it would be better if they didnt kill you with all the extra charges for every little thing. The service leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The man behind the counter was very abrasive. The negative customer service coupled with the extra charges does not make a customer want to return."}
{"text":"I think this place is family owned so they have that personal touch that is really nice. The falafel pita is crazy good. That's the only thing I've eaten here, so if you're into falafel, this would be the place. 

The atmosphere is pleasant enough. It's a casual eatery and is pretty busy during lunch time, but the service is fast and courteous."}
{"text":"Good Greek/Mediterranean food. But every time I go there they have a new waitress. I wonder why..."}
{"text":"Not sure why but every time I come here, the place is usually empty. I usually get the chicken pita sandwich. Chicken is juicy and flavorful. Their tzatki sauce is amazing!!! My fiancé usually gets a platter. Fries are good and crispy but obviously previous frozen. Staff is nice and restaurant is clean. This is honestly a hidden gem. I don't get why more people aren't here."}
{"text":"Terrific food here.  The Gyro's are great and the meat is flavorful and moist, not dried out or overcooked as found in other restaurants.  Everything is very fresh and the warm pitas are great too!  Proprietor/chef is also quite friendly and accommodating.  Portion sizes are generous and may require a to-go box.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This wasn't a planned lunch stop, but in the end, I'm glad my friend and I ended up here.  The place we wanted to go was closed for some reason, so we jumped on Yelp to find another place nearby.  I had a gyro sandwich was was really good.  The pita was fresh and the tzatziki sauce was not too runny.  I don't live in Charlotte, but if I ever find myself back there, I would go to the Akropolis Kafe again."}
{"text":"This place is close to my office and it's definitely a little gem in Ballantyne.  They're always slammed at lunch and I can understand why.  Food is delicious and the service is on point.  If you live or work in Ballantyne corporate park, you should check this place out.  My favorite is the chicken souvlaki (no. 12)."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch one weekday afternoon.  Decent food at a decent price.

Atmosphere - Clean, basic, small, busy, pizza shop-ish

Food - I ordered the Chicken Kabob which came on a wooden skewer.  It was accompanied with a Greek salad, Steak fries, and a pita.  The Kabob was tasty but the salad was drowning in dressing.  The Steak fries were awesomely crisp with a tender inside.  The pita was fresh tasting.  

Service - It was prompt with hints that the owner was present as any question was quickly answered in a way that seemed to say the responder cared about answering you correctly.  I was a little disappointed that the food came on a Styrofoam plate (see photo) but this place is more geared toward takeout. 

Overall - While the salad was more or less ruined by the amount of dressing, everything else was tasty.  I would stop here again...but would recommend to anyone when ordering to get the dressing on the side."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch, hoping for authentic Greek food. However, both are meals were disappointing. I had the chicken souvlaki platter, and my wife had the gyro platter. Both salads were literally swimming in dressing - way overkill (but tolerable). However, the meats, which should have been the star of the dishes, were both less than stellar. My chicken had little flavor, and was slightly undercooked. My wife's gyro meat was 'mushy' and tasted like a hot dog. (My guess is that it was pre-sliced from the gyro 'log', then kept warm in water.)
We ended up just leaving and going to Moe's...  I would not go back."}
{"text":"The chicken shishkabob (#12 platter) was delicious, filling, and cheap ($8.75)! I got extra salad instead of fries. It came with plenty of veggies, and the dressing was great (It looked like it was made in-house). The woman working at the counter and bringing the food out was kind and quick to ask how the food was or if we needed anything. We have a new favorite Greek place in the Pineville/Ballantyne area!"}
{"text":"Stopped here while passing through, and was surprised by the quality of the food. Everything is fresh, the owners are friendly and happy to make substitutions. Will come back for sure- outstanding experience."}
{"text":"Always consistent freshness. Greek salad w/chk is the perfect lunch. Love their dressing and tzatziki. In restaurant atmosphere is average but the food is great. Recently we've been ordering their catering platters to go and set it up as a self serve for family or guests in a casual setting."}
{"text":"Within the past month or so we've ordered from this place at least 3x. We don't eat out often so that's a lot for us. We order the gyro platter every time. And every time it's delicious! The food is PLENTIFUL & it's all so good: gyro, fries, salad & pita bread. Not only is the amount abundant & tasty, but it's ready in 10 minutes or less- literally. Oh & when you walk in the aroma is heaven!"}
