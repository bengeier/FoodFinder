{"text":"Very friendly staff. Their food is delicious and I'd definitely come again. I ordered the thali and they gave me a slightly burnt one so I asked to change it and they did kindly! Their biryani is totally worth price and was a bit spicier than expected. I'd recommend this place to anyone who enjoys indian vegetarian food for a good price."}
{"text":"Really amazing and simple food. I ordered the thali with Kari pakora, daal and chana. I liked Kari the most but other two options were not bad. It came with a little bit of salad and rice and then 2 home made kind of rotis. It also included a little bit of suji halwa as sweet. Perfectly tasting food. Haven't had anything like that from a take out place for a very long time.  Kari pakora is must try I would suggest."}
{"text":"Amazing veg biryani  and thali.  Priced well. Pav Bhaji is good as well. Curry pakoda made here is awesome as well.  Great place"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and got the combo platter each time. There was so much food that it took me two meals to finish it all. The staff are friendly and explained what each dish was. The dishes are packed with flavour and I really like the flat bread that comes with it. My favourite thing was the halwa dessert that comes with the meal. It's fluffy with the perfect amount of sweetness. The second time I went, there were some different dishes to try.  My only comment is that I wish they would have a greater selection of less spicy dishes because my tongue isn't very good with hotness.  And as Ryan D commented, the address listed is incorrect. They're located at 1410 Victoria Park at Sunrise."}
{"text":"A cozy place that serves delicious food- comforting,homey and fresh flavours. Servings are generous. Will definitely be back for more. The dal makhni, rajma and doodhi dal(ash gourd dal) were luscious and melt in your mouth.   Do not miss the aam ras to round off your meal. The rotis were warm and soft. Satiating and comforting meal!"}
{"text":"Had the chance one ordering delivery from uber eats.  I was impressed by the taste and portions. Usually I am very wary on trying new Indian restaurants since they have a tendency to be very salty.   The flavours were perfect and just the right amount of spice. The portions were perfect, I actually ordered a lot more since I assumed the portions would be small.   I would suggest to try the thali, 3 Currys with rice, roti, dessert and veggies.  My new go to place to veggie/Indian food even my husband was impressed and he is a meat eater."}
{"text":"Excellent counter service Indian food. All vegan. Very friendly service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had the amazing luck recently to be driving past the The Veggie Thali, thought it sounded familiar, decided to stop in. WOWOWOW! I am so glad I did. I have since then become an addicted fan of their food. The place is small. Two tables that seat 4 each and a bar with a few taller stools. But, more about the food; everything is made fresh from scratch, no canned chickpeas, no canned anything. They are all vegan now, having shifted from offering a couple of vegetarian options. Have been entirely vegan for a while. And, the food is incredible. I have mostly tried the thail. It is a very full portion of food including rice, 2 rotis, julienne veggie salad, dessert, and 3 choices of \"mains\", out of several. The samosas are also incredible, also hand-made from scratch. I find the overall spice level perfect, I don't like it too spicy.  The take-out containers are perfect to keep the different sections of the thali separate, details like this make the place. This is a family business, all the staff including non-family are welcoming, informed, and seem genuinely committed to being there and offering good service. The price is very affordable.  The entire place it totally spotless. I used their washroom, have never seen such a clean one!  I highly recommend going there and trying their amazing food. Take out it a great option if you are on the run. You can order in advance for pickup. Bon Appetite! See you there! :)"}
{"text":"Perfectly flavourful, fresh and delicious Indian cuisine with warm and friendly service = an A+ experience! Modern, bright and welcoming atmosphere if you want to dine in. This is the only place I go for spicy-good Indian food. You don't even miss the meat because each vegetarian or vegan dish is cooked to perfection and bursting with delightful flavour! Must-try: Channa Masala, Dal Makhni, Aloo Gobi and Roti. The Indian dessert (forget the name) was absolutely divine!"}
{"text":"I had the Thai (of course) with Channa, also, and mixed veg. Everything was great! I really like the halwa too. The service was quick and good portions."}
{"text":"We usually don't give 5 but We were quite impressed with the quality, service and the price.  Strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered the thali and wasn't disappointed at all. I got the spinach, yellow dal and aloo gobi which were all delicious. Will try their other items sometime, but looks promising."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Veggie Thali.  Came in for late lunch around 4:30 pm and the place was empty. Friendly girl at the front and another older lady in the back. They specialize in vegetarian Indian food, especially their Thali plates. You get 2 pieces of roti, 3 sides, a small salad (onion, mango, green pepers), + a semolina dessert with raisins. All for a very reasonable $9 and change.  I ordered the : Thali with -butter chicken paneer (with cheese instead of chicken lol) -cauliflower (my fave) -chickpeas  Id recommend this spot for a quick lunch! Good is good. Just wish a few dishes were warmer."}
{"text":"We have been to this place a few times. The food and service is great  They have a nice mixed plate - thalia - that comes with roti and dessert  The woman is very nice and explains the dishes for those that are less familiar with vegetarian indian food"}
{"text":"Small but neat and clean place.Being a vegetarian I always look for something new.Though there are better places near by but this was not bad."}
{"text":"Tried the thali and veggie biryani so far. Loved both! They are so flavourful and both have a good kick to them."}
{"text":"We had takeout from this place 2 days ago. It was amazingly good value for your buck. For 7.99 you get to choose 3 sides and it came with rice 2 rotti, a Salad and a dessert.  The dessert was very interesting. It's semolina grain mixed with nuts and raisin. It's almost like rice pudding and not quite.   I don't know what the sides were coz my co worker ordered them for me. They were nonetheless delicious. One of them was cauliflower, anther one is a lentil kinda of thing.  The rotti smells wonderful and slightly sweetened...   This is a totally vegetarian place with a lot of vegan choices as well.  Love"}
{"text":"As an Indian who is always on the lookout for good Indian restaurants (particularly Veggie ones) in Scarborough, I can confidently say that this is one of the top veggie Indian restaurants that I have been to. It's a cozy establishment and has a small menu but I don't mind as I prefer quality over quantity.   The Roti is soft and very tasty and the curries in the Thaali are all full of flavour. The restaurant eating area is clean and tidy. The only minor issue I had with my food is that the Mung Daal curry was slightly salty but not a deal breaker.   I'm going to definitely go back and try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Exploring Vegetarian food with my foodie friend; hubby is a pure carnivore and wouldn't be caught dead in a place like this. Small eatery in a small strip mall. Nice and clean with friendly staff.  We both went with the Thali lunch so that we could try 6 different items (we sampled each other's plates) as well as their roti and dessert which accompanied it. We chose the most popular items (see pics).  Favorites are: Aloo Gobi - tumeric spiced cauliflower and potatoes, medium spice level. Sabzi - medley of seasonal vegetables, medium spice level. Halwa - dessert made with semolina, dried fruits and syrup. It was fluffy and light in texture with just enough sweetness to tickle the taste buds.  I was disappointed that they had no ice and their regular water, which was served in a nice bottle, was room temperature. Next time I'll buy the bottled water; they also have a refrigerated case of bottled and canned drinks.  All in all a good experience with my first vegetarian restaurant: there were enough tasty items that filled us up and left us satisfied. Need to come back to try more items so I can bump up the rating."}
{"text":"Ummm. Yas. Oh my god, yas.  Was searching for a vegetarian restaurant to eat at and found this little gem on yelp.  First time here.   Food was so damn good that we ordered more to take home for tomorrow's lunch.  Clean, great prices for great portions and great service.  Best hidden treasure, we've found, yet! We are definitely coming back for more."}
{"text":"After some furniture browsing (without buying anything) along Eglinton Ave last Saturday, my friend and I walked down to Veggie Thali for dinner. The place was not at all what I expected (although this doesn't take away from the very good food), only a very small eating area with four tables and a few chairs at a side counter, no real d√©cor or wait service, and plastic cutlery. There is a hot-table counter at the back to place your order, with the menu on two displays above, and a cooler at the side for the pop and juice. The service was friendly enough, with a brief explanation of what each item was, and the food was ready quite fast.  As for the food, it was very good, although not as spicy as I thought some dishes would be. We each had a hot-table thali, which comes with rice, salad, roti and dessert. I had channa masala, mung beans, and spiced cauliflower and potatoes; I believe my friend had lentils and squash, seasoned vegetables, and spiced cauliflower and potatoes also. Everything was served on a thali, which is the metal dish divided into several little sections. The channa masala was the best of my choices, although I would have preferred if it was spicier; the mung beans were good mixed with the rice. The roti were very thin and made with whole wheat I think. The dessert was interesting; my friend said it tasted like cream of wheat, which is fairly close as it was apparently sweetened semolina with bits of fruit. Other than the thali, they also serve a vegetable biryani and samosas, along with some side dishes.  Overall, it was a very good meal. With pop and an extra serving of rice, the bill came to $28 for two, perhaps a little more than some similar places but worth it."}
{"text":"I love their Thali. Which comes with a choice of 4 veggie dishes, rice and 3 rotis ( to be precise chowpathis) and a desert. The value for money is great when u consider the task and quality of the food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It's melt in your mouth good food bursting with flavour. Sometimes I forget I'm eating a completely vegetarian meal because you really don't even miss the meat! We've dined in and done take-out. Both experiences were amazing. The rotis are freshly handmade (you can see them making them in the back) and the food is plenty considering the price. In a thali you get 2 rotis, a salad, plenty of rice and a choice of 3 hot dishes. You also get dessert. All for a mere $8! And the staff is super friendly, as well! A must try for anyone in the area."}
{"text":"So good!! I was craving vegetarian food so we made the trek up here and it was so worth it. Every curry was solid and incredibly satisfying. It's not oily and greasy and the portions for the price are so worth it. Also, for every curry you get you get a whole tray of rice, such a great deal! Aloo Gobi is the best. We also like the Saag, Daal, and Rajma. The only thing I've had there that wasn't great was the Daal Makhani. Definitely prefer to order individual curries as the portions are bigger. The space is clean and bright and the staff who work there are so nice!"}
{"text":"Awesome Thali food. Very authentic tasting. very healthy. try mango mango shake hwich is good as well."}
{"text":"Expect simple, healthy Indian vegetarian food and you won't end up disappointed. I tried the Thali which consists of Rice, Roti and your choice of three vegetable curries. Salad and a dessert (usually halwa) is provided. The site claims to provide home made food and it indeed is. The food is prepared by a Gujrati lady and there is no overdose of colors, masala and preservatives. Sometimes, simplicity just wins!  A Thali costs about $7.99 (pre taxes) and sounds reasonable - given that it comes with a dessert too. Perhaps, they could offer additional rice too in case someone asks for it. The folks there are friendly. The washrooms are clean and well maintained. An ideal place for takeaway food and occasional inroom dining (although the capacity is very small)."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and  reasonably priced. We had the daal, butter paneer, mixed vegetables and fresh roti. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for simple, fresh and favourful Indian food."}
{"text":"Very affordable for the amount of food. Also the food is deliciously tasty. Clean establishment, quick take out, friendly staff.  I shared my thali with a friend as there was plenty of food.  Not really a place you would drive across the city for, but if you're in this hood, this place is a must if you're a local."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and really friendly service. The restaurant has only been opened for a few weeks now and I've eaten there several times. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The Veggie Thali had become my new obsession. I keep trying more things on the menu & everything has been amazing. I don't know if I have ever loved a menu as much as I do here. The food is incredible! I have brought many friends here and everyone has said it's amazing as well. YOU HAVE TO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT END OF STORY!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars  Ok, so this is a great place if you are vegan and looking for some decent Indian food. However, if you are looking for authentic vegetarian Indian food, this is not the place for you. We actually didn't even realize it was a vegan restaurant until we arrived. We simply thought it was a vegetarian restaurant with vegan options.   I had found this place when I searched up Vegetarian Indian Food into Yelp. After looking at the reviews, it looked pretty decent and I decided to try it out.   We got the Veggie Thali and the Veggie Biryani. The Thali was just average, especially because there were limited quantities of Indian subjies you can make vegan. You will not find certain items like Paneer dishes(Indian Cheese ) or Malai dishes because they typically include dairy.  It came with 3 subjies, 2 roties and a dessert. They did not allow us to substitute the dessert for an additional subji, but instead you would have to pay an additional $2 which I was not a fan of. The roties were also not in house made, they definitely tasted store bought, and simply heated up. The Veggie Biryani actually tasted pretty good, it was fragrant, full of veggies, and had a nice kick of spice to it.   The interior seems really new and clean, but it has limited seating, so takeout might be your best option if you're planning on going with more than 4 people. The staff is friendly and service is pretty fast . We did chat with one of the owners while our food was being made, and we asked them what they use instead of ghee ( clarified indian butter ) He told me they use a plant based ghee, which was not necessarily healthier, but it was vegan. Overall I don't think I would come back, but I would still definitely recommend it any of my vegan friends looking for a Vegan Indian Restaurant."}
{"text":"I came here based on all the great Yelp reviews. It's a nice little place but I'm unsure if it's a five star place. The place was clean and the service was friendly. The food seemed healthy and nutritious but I wouldn't describe it as bursting with flavour. I think I remembered the curries being fairly watered down.  If I lived in the area it's a place I would consider going to. But I don't think I'd drive across town to get there."}
{"text":"We like the food as it wasn't restaurant like but more home made kinds ( less spicy ) , it was clean but as Indians we realized it is expensive than most places . Infact we are not sure if the mango juice was fresh ; it tasted like one of the tetra pack mango juices sold back home . Not sure though ! Staff was friendly .Quantity was less hence we found it costly ."}
{"text":"I love this place so much that my boyfriend and I go about once to twice a week to have lunch here. Food is so flavourable and delicious and the customer service is always friendly."}
{"text":"It's a small place serving some amazing homely vegan Indian food. We went for Samosa as a starter, a Pav Bhaji plate and their Thali. In the end, we also tried their Kabab Wrap.   Food: Samosa was quite good, although the filling was simple (potatoes and peas seasoned with salt and pepper). Pav Bhaji was really tasty. It was less spicy, so could have been better. The bun was nice and well toasted. Red onions would go better than white ones. Lemon was too small. Coming to the Thali, it had Roti, Aloo Gobi and Saag sabzi, Daal, Plain Rice, Salad and Suji Halwa. We also ordered Papad separately to complement the Thali. Roti was very good - soft and homely. Aloo Gobi was great. Not much spicy but just enough. I am not really a fan of Saag, in general, but this one was eatable. The best thing in the Thali was Daal - really great and homely. It was mildly spiced - not sure if they were trying to replicate a Gujarati Daal then it was not a good job done. Rice was good and fluffy. The salad was not seasoned at all - maybe it was the way they wanted to keep it. The raw mango in the salad was nice, but otherwise, it was just capsicum and onions. I loved the Suji Halwa as well - very difficult to create the same wow factor when made vegan because the non-vegan version uses ghee and it's very difficult to beat that taste. However, this one used vegetable oil but the Halwa was still quite rich. Papad was disappointing - too oily (they had fried it) - but I guess if we had known, we would have asked for a roasted one. Kabab Wrap was great too - simple and humble roll which was very well spiced and quite neat to eat.   Ambiance: It's a small place with 2-3 tables and a few high chairs. Most of their customers would be for takeout is what we felt - especially students and bachelors who may not be knowing cooking that much; it's a great place for them to have meals. Good natural light on a sunny day and even otherwise, during the day.   Staff and Service: The staff was good and friendly. The service was decently quick to us but there was another customer who had been waiting for her Papad for long and was visibly not very happy about the wait as she was more than halfway through her meal.   Overall, it's a great place to have some good Indian vegan food."}
{"text":"Was extremely impressed by the taste and quality! Will definitely visit multiple times!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Both of us got the Thali plate and a mango juice and it came to $26. The flavours were strong with just enough spice and the naan was soft and fresh. If it's your first time I definitely recommend the Thali plate as you get to try a lot of the dishes!"}
{"text":"Neat and clean place with plenty of parking up front.   The menu is a simple set of choices (thali, pau bhaji, veg biryani) and is served on stainless steel plates that also form the logo of the place.   The portion sizes are quite reasonable and the food is not spicy."}
{"text":"Tiny place with few food options. They give 2 chapatis and 3 choices of curry, rice and dessert. Being a vegan place, the menu is quite restricted. If you are in thd neighborhood and don't have other options, then try this."}
