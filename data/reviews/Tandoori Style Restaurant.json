{"text":"I hit a an Oil Well! 
I tried the vegetarian fare at this place and was sorely disappointed. They use so much oil in their curries I could open a retail store selling extracted oil. Other sore points: their quantities are very small for what they charge. And the food flavor is extremely plain fare. I will not recommend not return."}
{"text":"The main advantage this place has is that it's good for dining in (not to say it's fancy or anything). I find most South Asian places are either take-out and if they're dine-in then they're a bit more expensive so this is in-between.

Not the best kababs I've had. I'm not a fan of onions in salad/kabab rolls either. Nothing was bad and nothing was that good. If you do get the kababs then I'd recommend the chicken ones instead of beef. I did like the Afghani chicken because it had that nice smoked taste to it but if that's your thing then a Turkish/Afghan restaurant is probably better. The naans weren't bad at all and I won't comment on the curries since I don't really like those but others thought they were okay. If you wanna play it safe then stick with the \"tandoori corner\" part of their menu.

The prices were reasonable, you can get more than enough food in their family of 4 combo for $35. Living in MIssissauga, I won't go out of the way to go here repeatedly but if you live in Brampton/Etobicoke then this is one of the better South Asian options."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place when I was living in Brampton 3 years ago. So far I have not found a restaurant that makes biryani and butter chicken as pleasing and inviting to my family. I presently live in Ajax and every so often I come back to this restaurant to eat some delicious food.

The biryani I ate, have never tasted this before at any Indian restaurant. The taste had alot of flavours happening. Along with the kebobs and nann and the other curry dishes as well. In fact there is a menu for family as well. 

Price is good, in addition to the exotic food that I ate. It was nice to see the price was affordable. Keep up the good work and let me know when you decide to move east!"}
{"text":"I went to Tandoori Style with my family and was amazed at the service and quality of food! The food was all made fresh to order, and everything was absolutely delicious. We came here aroud 9pm and there was plenty of seating available, and the server was very patient with all 9 of us ordering. The naan was amazing, which is the sign of a good indian restaurant in my opinion, and the food was very flavourful (and a little on the spicy side, which we all loved). If I'm ever in the Brampton area again, this is my spot!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful place, I'd rather starve. My family and I were insulted by the terrible service. Do yourself a favour and please go across the street to Kwality or McD's instead. 

The restaurant was empty except for another table that got excellent service, while we starved. The idiot server was aloof and infuriatingly frustrating. We ordered tea + meals, and only got our tea after asking 3 times and waiting 40 mins. 

It appears this dump's main focus is take out, which we unfortunately found out the hard way. As we waited to pay for our tea, after giving up on our food, we saw the cooks behind the glass handling food without wearing gloves or hair nets. 

Not only is the service terrible, but it's unhygienic as well. I can't imagine the number of health codes it violates on a regular basis. 

Here's hoping this place gets shut down."}
{"text":"I ordered the biryani and kebabs but i made a big mistake.  I assumed these guys were like other restaurants and give rice with a chicken leg but these guys made there biryani with pieces of boneless chicken which tasted really good. 

The reason why i said i made a mistake is because they fill the box of biryani and i couldn't finish the biryani and couldnt make space for the kebabs which also tasted really good. I bought the chicken ones. 

I do highly recommend this place to others however i do have to warn you that if your alone you wont be able to finish their portions unless ur a big fella.
Good luck and happy eating!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious here! The place is small but functional and the location is a bit odd (there's not a lot happening in this part of Brampton), but it's a hidden gem for those looking for some good Middle Eastern Halal food. 

We arrived shortly before prayer service ended, so there was plenty of seating available (but it fills up quickly shortly after! Also, they've got a small prayer room as well off to the side). The service was quick and patient with us while explaining things we didn't understand. For four people, we ordered:
- palak paneer
- lamb biryani
- chicken kabab masala
- nihari

Everything but the biryani came with naan, so we were pretty much set. Let me just say that the food was amaaaazing. The heat was perfect (I was really surprised that palak paneer was spicy!), and the naan and biryani helped to cool things down a bit. The flavours blended together really well - the beef in the nihari was SO tender, and the kabab had a great texture to the meat. 

They've also got some great take-out meal options for a really reasonable price, but even if you dine in you'll be feasting for cheap. This place is winner in my books!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Biryani was flavorful. Meat tender. Palak paneer was to die for. Naan was different but very good. Price is affordable. Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"My friend is a huge fan of Tandoori Style and I was introduced and visited a couple times after. You're not really expecting a service/fancy seating here but you're in for generous portions, price, and flavourful dishes. Butter chicken, chicken kebobs, and biryani was definitely new to me, it still is but pretty good!"}
{"text":"Really good Tali,  with the best naan and kebab. Affordable and attentive service.  A tiny bit spicy for me but then again I'm not a local so this can be expected.Great stop for those getting their cars repaired at one of the many nearby mechanics (I recommend Devinder at Bharj Bros. in the same Plaza)"}
{"text":"The naan at this place is fantastic because it's perfect for dipping and absorbing sauces. My uneducated guess is that they remove many air bubbles before baking using a docker (a spiked roller often used on pizzas to remove air bubbles that would otherwise expand. Each piece of na'an is also thicker. We ordered a second helping of na'an for the 3 of us just to finish up the rest of our dishes.

The chicken jalfrezi was oily, but it was good and the chicken was tender. The butter chicken looked better. Choosing is very difficult because of the many options they have.

Next time we'll try the daily specials written on the chalkboard on the wall behind the register. Totally missed that. Service was unremarkable.

{"text":"Decent food, nothing special. Actually I went there once and never ended up going back. When it comes to desi food, I have high standards. Sorry! So when I heard this place has good kabobs, I went. The kabobs were red in color, and not juicy or tasty the way a good kabob tastes like.  It's been about 2+ years that I went there, maybe they have improved. 

One thing, they make good naan, I have picked up naan from there for a party at home."}
