{"text":"We were completely thrilled to have lunch here.  Friends of ours took us out to eat and we ate very well.    Before we went, our friends told us this is the type of place where they make one menu each day and you have a very limited number of choices.  But, it is also a market so you can get just about anything.  (a bit confusing of our friends)  Food wise, the food was amazing.  We ate everything from some amazing panchetta to a fantastic lamb dish stuffed in the flowers of summer squash.  We also got to enjoy some fresh pasta - a fettuccine dish with mushrooms and sausage.  The bread was really good.  We also enjoyed some great pizza and Focaccia.  For dessert we enjoyed a type of lemon ice (no idea what it was called).  The staff was really good.  We were warmly greeted by our wait staff.  We got to meet one of the owners.  The kitchen is part of the restaurant (you can see them cook everything).  Every time we had a question about the food, the cooks were happy to answer our questions and give us little snips of the food they were working on.    The ambiance was also really wonderful.  It is a small place setup like a market with a few tables in the middle.  The tables are setup to be communal spaces.  While we filled one table completely, I saw several other groups of people sit at a table and then slowly talk with one another and have interesting looking conversations.  If you are looking for a private table for two, this is not the place for you!  We have no idea what the total price was for our meal as we were treated.  The entrees were in the $25-30 range on the menu.  The staff was happy to accommodate the dietary restrictions of our group & even double check with the kitchen staff/cooks if there were particular ingredients in various food items.  I would love to return here sometime for dinner."}
{"text":"La nourriture est excellente, la boutique est déco et propre.   Néanmoins, j'enlève deux étoiles, une pour le service, car à chaque fois que j'y vais, c'est très lent. Il y a 4 ou 5 personnes derrière le comptoir, mais une seule qui sert vraiment les clients.   La deuxième étoile, c'est pour les prix. Certes, c'est excellent, mais 300 g de foccacia à 7$, c'est beaucoup trop pour ce que l'on a.  Je recommande quand même de tester !"}
{"text":"Meilleur restaurant italien de Montréal pour luncher. Très sympatique. Cuisine authentique italienne. Le chef vient vous voir à votre table et c'est comme s'il vous invitait chez lui. A essayer et adopter. Vous aurez toujours le goût d'y revenir.  Stragusto, comme ils disent..."}
{"text":"This place was great!  We were so disappointed we found it AFTER already having lunch, otherwise we would have gotten a full lunch... but it was 100% worth going for dessert!  Initially we stopped in because from the outside it looked like an Italian import shop and I wanted to see if they had anything that is harder to find at the shops at home in the US.  We were happy to find that in addition to specialty foods (which were really nice) they also served food. I speak literally no French beyond yes/no, so for me it was exciting to see the owner there and get to speak Italian-- it was my first real conversation in Montreal haha  But this place was the real deal-- it reminded me of the small shops I'd go to with a kid with my nonna.  We got split a cannoli and sfogliatelle with our coffees, and they were outstanding!  Just like homemade or any that I get in Italy.  I was excited to find a place outside of home that had such traditional items as sfogliatelle, so this was an exciting and delicious surprise!  The woman I presume is the owner was so nice and helpful!  My only regret is that we didn't get to have a delicious lunch there!  Everything looked out of this world!"}
{"text":"Oh man! I thought I reviewed this place ages ago when I passed by for a bite right after the opening and I had the amazing experience of the gent behind the range in the wide open kitchen whip me up what he felt I needed at that moment - a massive vegetable sandwich - and he was right.   Recently we rolled in after a long day of cheese sampling (don't ask, it was awesome and gave me a dairy high.) We tucked into one of the four communal tables, ordered coffees and a ricotta cake to share. The service was a bit jumbly, it felt like you had members of a family asking you the same things and forgetting what you asked for and leaving things on your table, but it was friendly and not infuriating. The coffees were tasty, and the ricotta cake was just wonderful. Lemony, not oversweet, moist and with a perfect crust, just so good and so perfect with coffee.   Love it. Will return."}
{"text":"A very nice looking Italian store with great looking displayed items and a full kitchen with large tables.  We were there early and not yet ready for lunch but we would not hesitate to try their menu of the day the next time in town.  Very friendly staff."}
