{"text":"Love this place -- great food at reasonable prices, excellent service and location (no parking hassles like downtown Oakville). My seafood loving friends rave about the Lobster Grilled Cheese sandwich while I tend to always order the Reef (spicy jerk flavour!). Lettuce wraps and Cali also fav's while sitting in a booth -- very comfy!"}
{"text":"Very surprised at how good the food snd service here is.  Great vibe in the bar with a good crowd.  I ordered the flat bread and it was really good. Will be going back for sure"}
{"text":"I just came home from a late lunch at this establishment.  I am blown away.  The food was terrific.  I have lived in Oakville since '93 and this was by far the best meal I have ever had in this town.  Lettuce wraps were a delight, although a bit messy, well worth the effort.  Today's soup was veggie with coconut cream...OMG so good and the turkey burger was really fresh turkey meat with the perfect accompaniment of spice and greens and an aioli that was not too hot nor too bland.  There was real tomato on it as well and not one tiny piece but two healthy slices and this is Nov!~   If you want a great meal with terrific family friendly service and a price that won't make you wish you had stayed in go to this place."}
{"text":"The chef, Brad Taylor, makes THE best lobster bisque I have EVER tasted. This is the only place to eat in Oakville.  Good luck and great success to you!  You are a great bunch."}
{"text":"YOU GOTTA EAT HERE! What more can I say? Try the crab and lobster dip. Try the bison burger. Try the Flying Beaver. Try the gluten-free chocolate cake. Try everything!!!!"}
{"text":"Great service,  fresh,  good  draught beer selection,  the cowboy is way hotter than they say.  Sweet potato fries are awesome and an all around great experience"}
{"text":"I have dined at The Gingerman Social Eatery on three occasions with various family members.  It is always a \"Stoney's is packed\" situation and we are looking for a quick alternative.

Our consensus is the following:
-  Nice comfortable space
-  Friendly staff
-  Solid menu + good draft beer selection
-  Great fries
-  Average main courses - which rates a two star deduction in my books since it is usually contributing to the majority of the bill 

I would give it 4 stars as a drinks and appetizers destination."}
{"text":"Horrible Service!  Lunch consisted of Chicken and mango lettuce wraps with old lettuce, tasteless chicken.

Server seemed uninterested.

Not the best managed restaurant.  Good luck in Oakville."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed the short menu. Nice small place with good food. Nothing too extravagant or different on the menu but was a nice setting and good food all around."}
{"text":"Food is good but I've been twice on live music night and it's really hard to have a conversation over dinner."}
{"text":"Our first visit there was a disaster. Bad food and not so caring service. That was probably a year an a half ago. 
Since, we've been back couple times for a quick snack (Nachos- quite good) and drinks. Both times pretty good experience. 
Great atmosphere, overall a cool place to hang out"}
{"text":"Today I went here for lunch. I went with a few friends, and their food was decently good. Mine was not bad. My issue is with the service actually. My waitress wasn't rude, just really not great. I ordered the mini turkey sliders. I looked at the menu and the regular turkey burger had cheese. But the sliders didn't, hence thats what I ordered. When it arrived there was cheese all over the sliders, on the bun, on the meat. I asked if there was supposed to be cheese on it, she said yes. And I said I don't eat cheese, and I don't remember seeing that on the menu description. She said \"its goat cheese\".... (kind of frustrating and she seemed condescending , as its still cheese) and kind of made me feel like it was my fault and I was being difficult.  She said the kitchen was busy and it would take 20mins to remake it and if I could just scrape it off. ?!?!?!? I agreed as I didnt want to make it difficult but asked her to bring me the menu as I didn't believe it said cheese on my order. When she brought the menu there was No Cheese in the description for the sliders. So she said the menu has changed amd they didnt update it yet, and that she would still bring me something to scrape the cheese off with (seriously, not my issue that the menu changed).  She offered not to charge me fully for the plate. Its the principle, not the money.

Saving grace, she came back and said she talked to the manager and they would rush me a new one. And when the bill came she took care of my ice tea. I mean not the worst experience, but really disappointed in her service and how she kept pushing the issue back to me and asking me to scrape off the cheese."}
{"text":"My bf and I came here on December 30th, 2013.  I remember that date clearly because we were on our way to Niagara Falls for a bday celebration. 
We were actually planning to go to the sandwich place next door, but it was closed on that day for some renovation. So we had to quickly find another place to eat, and we stumbled into this place. Boy, sometimes you just wish that you didn't make stupid choices like this one! 

When we got in, we were seated by a waitress and we noticed that there was a large group sitting at  a long table. Besides them, there were only a couple other tables. It's definitely not \"busy lunch hour\" by all means. From the menu, we quickly realized that they are trying to be an upscale bar. Even though they offer standard pub food, the price, however, is considerably higher than your typical bars. But when you gotta eat, you gotta eat, right? We ordered two entries, a pulled pork sandwich and a chicken panini. 

Then, everything went downhill from there. We were waiting, and waiting, and waiting... what a quick lunch stop turned into an hour long waiting marathon. The waitress stopped by 3 or 4 times at our table and the nearby small tables to apologize for the slow speed, giving us excuses like how busy they were, how the kitchen was having a hard time, blah blah blah.. I understand that sometimes waiters and waitresses don't have much control on the preparation of the food, HOWEVER, the real problem here is in the management of this place. There's a window to the kitchen area, so you can sort of see inside. I saw 3 or 4 cooks, wandering around, who looked so at leisure that they could have been flipping burgers on the BBQ in their backyard! I didn't sense that the kitchen was under any pressure to send food out! They were just talking, wandering around and having a good time inside. Having obtained my own culinary art degree, I have some understanding in the food industry, and this is definitely not how you run a kitchen! 

Now, what made everything even worse though is, the kitchen did send out food once in a while, but everything went straight to the party table! It seemed that the group had a lot more priority than all the other small tables.But then I noticed a blond woman sitting at the party table occasionally helped herself to bring food from the kitchen to the table, and later she was doing stuff at the cash machine. OHHHHH, so that makes a lot more sense! My guess is, she's probably one of the owners and they were having a party in her own restaurant! I hope the managers see this post, and realize that this is just not how you run a successful restaurant! Sure, you can definitely have a party in your own place, but at what cost? It's just not right to place your customers behind your own needs. Next time, don't be a cheapo, just close down the place and have an actual private party. 
Oh, and did I mention that the waitress offered to deduct $5 off our $50 bill? Geeez, that's just oh so sad and pathetic. 

1 star is just for the food. It tasted alright, but it was not worth the drama and frustration. When you screw up BIG time on someone's birthday, that just became personal."}
{"text":"When I was visiting Toronto, I ended up here for some dinner and drinks with my brothers and cousins. It definitely has a modern feel, very chill vibe. Sandwiches seem to be their specialty, so I stuck to that. I got the Cowboy sandwich, which consisted of pulled pork, jalapenos and potato chips. The pork was tender and tasty and the jalapenos added a nice kick to the flavor profiles. I also liked the crunch from the potato chips to offset all the soft textures in the sandwich. The fries that came alongside it were well cooked as well. I know it's weird to point out the fries, but it's surprising how many times I've received soggy fries at restaurants. Don't leave fries under heat lamps, friends! It is not a pretty sight.

Service was okay when we went. The waitress was nice, but not overly attentive. The live music was a nice touch though and the band were interacting with the audience frequently. Definitely a nice little joint to check out if you are in the Oakville area!"}
{"text":"Cool little place with a great selection of beer on tap!

Had the burgers and they were perfect and exactly what we were looking for."}
{"text":"I'm not really sure how or why this place has such a high rating. The food is ok at best. Service was not good - almost like we were a burden to our server. 

My husband really enjoyed his bison burger & fries but my falafel wrap was mushy and flavourless. My friend who is a vegan also wanted to get the falafel wrap and ON the menu it said \"vegan falafel\" but turns out they don't know what the definition of vegan is because there was egg in it and the servers response was \"oh they messed that up - there's egg in it.\" 

????????


So she had to get a plate of salad for almost 15 dollars. Which consisted of wilted lettuce, balsamic and mushy tomatoes. 


Needless to say, we won't go back."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I came here today with a few friends for lunch. I tried the \"We are the North\" pulled pork sandwich, which comes topped with slaw and candied bacon, and the sweet potato fries. The pulled pork is delicious. Saucy, but not too saucy. Flavourful. Crisp and fresh slaw. Yummy bacon. 

The fries were also great. I wish they had been a tad crisper, but the flavour was superb. 

This place is a bit on the costlier side (most lunch mains are about $15), but it's worth it. The decor is lovely and upscale and the waitstaff are friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"Gingerman has really good food must try the poutine one of the best and burgers sandwiches and appetizers are the best and they have beers from all over the world that you can't get at most places staff work really hard and are professional"}
{"text":"I chose to eat at Gingerman because of the rating on Yelp, and it was much better than four stars! The interior design was excellent and the booths were absolutely comfortable. Our waiter, Alan, was super friendly, and super efficient. The space used to be a bank and there's a private dining room in the old vault, which is super cool.

The food was awesome. It was hot and delicious and came out pretty quickly. The flavors were perfect and the great thing was that the flavors were not too heavy nor was the food too greasy or salty. If you like less salad dressing, though, you might want to ask for the dressing on the side.

I highly recommend Gingerman, and it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"A local pub that's got great food, very nice range of beers and the service is attentive and friendly. Burgers are a real treat!!"}
{"text":"This place exemplifies what happens when you put fresh, simple ingredients together with a staff that cares.  The food is simple but delicious. My \"We are the North\" pulled pork sandwich has been perfect on every occasion I've had to visit and try it. 

Upon the one occasion something didn't meet with my expectation, a case of me ordering something that probably didn't go with my sandwich, the owner offered me a complimentary dessert simply because he didn't want me to go away unhappy despite the fact that it was thirty minutes after the restaurant had closed for the night.

My wife and I both have nothing but praise for this eatery."}
{"text":"Am I really on Kerr Street?  Did Mark R. (not from Oakville) really snag the FTR?

The signage is beautiful, as is the interior.  Mostly booths (my favourite) but a few tables that might work for larger groups.  Plus some big U-shaped booths for parties of five (+) and a killer bar in the middle with seating all around.

The lunch menu had so many good options it made it tough to choose.  Being a little more upscale, it was surprisingly not too badly priced considering the quality and portion-size.  My lobster grilled cheese sandwich came with a choice of side (soup, salad or fries) and was priced at $16.  I don't know where their bread comes from but it was deeeelicious.  I don't know my grains very well, but there seemed to be quite a variety of them in there.  The filling was perfectly gooey and flavoured, not too salty as some seafood can be.

The highlight of my meal was the gingerbread man-shaped puff pastry floating in my soup.  You heard me.  How personal and creative!  The brandied mushroom soup was a nice thickness and well-flavoured (again without being too salty).  Perfect for a cold winter day.

My lunchmate ordered the croque à monsieur ($14).  It was très fancy!  In addition to the cheese inside the sandwich, there was lots of cheese (havarti I think?) melted on top.  It's a fork-and-knife situation.  The same deliciously fresh bread was used for her sandwich.  She ordered a salad with it and it was huge.  

The portions are very generous for lunch.  I was a pig and finished my entire meal, but my lunchmate had half a sandwich and lots of salad leftover to take home.

No complaints about the service.  It wasn't too busy when we went (it was early afternoon) so we didn't have much competition.  We didn't feel rushed, yet got in and out of there pretty quickly.

I noticed some interesting cocktails on their menu.  I will have to try this place for dinner and drinks to see what they're like in the evening.

Tip: While there's lots of paid parking (coin-operated machines) nearby, just go down the street and park on the residential street for FREE."}
{"text":"We came on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all. The food was pretty good; we got a burger and mushroom flat bread. We'll be back to try the rest of the burgers on the menu!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness. There is not one negative thing about the gingerman that I can think of. First, it looks small from the outside but it's actually pretty comfortable when you settle into a booth or seat - my brother and sister in law and I went to lunch here ona Friday around 1:30 and was immediately taken care of. We ordered yam fries for an appetizer (probably the best sweet potato fries ive ever had,ever) followed by a sandwich and soup. I got the chicken wrap and tortilla soup- as well as a the cowboy. I preferred the Cowboy and loved the soup, I will definitely be coming back to try their flat breads and salads in the future."}
{"text":"Pricey, but its Oakville.

The lobster grilled cheese is absolutely amazing I cant deny it that. The french fries that come alongside are also extremely good. Good atmosphere also."}
{"text":"Great burger (chipotle), great atmosphere. Wish there were more local beers on tap though."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my bucket list for sometime, and I'm glad I finally went. Their fish tacos was absolutely delicious! It comes as two options: salmon and tilapia. Tilapia was the best. (Salmon one was good too) Combined with the garlic aioli, the tacos were savoury. My boyfriend ordered the Flying Beaver burger and found it lacking flavour. I had the Naam burger, which I thought was good. It's nothing to ride home about, but it was good. Having the fish tacos as our starter set a pretty high bar that our entrees unfortunately couldn't match."}
{"text":"I went to The Gingerman Social Eatery with a friend a few Thursdays ago. The weather was beautiful, the patio open. When we walked in we noticed it was busy. We were attended to right away and asked to sit at the bar until a patio on the table became available. We were asked if we wanted a drink, we ordered water as the server said it wouldn't be long. After 10+ minutes went by and no patio table had become available, we wanted to order drinks a the bar. No one ever came back to check on us or ask us if we wanted a drink. 

Finally we were seated on the patio. Initially we were put directly behind the live music. We couldn't even remotely hear each other over the music. We were having to raise our voices meaning the whole patio could hear our conversation. Not happy. We took it upon ourselves to move to a different table on the patio once it became available. 

Initially our patio server was attentive. He was funny and made great suggestions. We let him know we wanted a bottle of wine and then we were going to order appetizers as we went. After the first appetizer was delivered and our first glasses of wine were pour our server disappeared. Although he walked by many times, he never looked over or asked how we were doing. We were ready to order more food and not a single patio server was coming over. It took us three hours to get three appetizers and a bottle of wine. That's pretty crazy! 

While the food itself was great and thoroughly enjoyed, I will not be going back based on the service alone. 

With all of this being said, my mom went the following day to the Gingerman for lunch with some of her friends and had a completely different experience. She said the service as well as the food was phenomenal. While I would have given a 2 star review, my mom's experience earned them an additional star. Guess it just depends on what staff are working."}
{"text":"The burgers are awesome here.  They are seasoned very well and the ingredients are top quality.  Great, relaxed atmosphere, and nice staff."}
{"text":"Great service, wonderful food, their pulled pork is a little too sweet and greasy for my taste though."}
{"text":"I'm just left The Gingerman. The atmosphere is pretty good. I'm not eating but from what I can see the food looks pretty good. Now the but and it's a good one. The bartender- manager? is chewing down on his fingernails and dropping them on the floor and who know where else."}
{"text":"Vibe was nice.  Nice bar meets trendy restaurant. It was very hot inside even though the windows were all open.  

Started with the TUNA TATAKI, it was great, the fish was fresh and the flavour was tasty, nice sear on that tuna and the slaw side and sauces were good pairings.

Had THE FLYING BEAVER burger, the burger was juicy and delicious but the fries were so greasy.  

Devoured the LETTUCE WRAPS, was a good portion and the taste was fresh but nothing too special.  Ordered the TORTILLA SOUP, that was the tastiest thing we had, the flavor was great and it was really heartwarming!

Service was not great, servers yelled a lot and didn't have a great attitude, we were waiting by the bar for a table and when a table became available, they yelled- \"hey, table for these two!!\"  Asked my server for another menu (only had one for the two of us) and she said, \"I still need to go get one ok?\"

Overall, fun vibes and a good option for Oakville. Wasn't amazing but wasn't terrible either."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a Saturday with a couple coworkers for lunch. They were severely understaffed and our waitress was inattentive. I understand that sometimes places get busier than they expect to be, but she was really not very good. I had a chicken wrap that I ordered without bacon--but it came with bacon. The best part of my meal was the side of jalapeño and chipotle aioli which was super yummy! Everything else was average."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday for lunch with my family and there was plenty of seating available (unlike Stoney's across the street!). It was nice to have guaranteed seating without waiting at all. The food selection was normal, but the portions were generous and quality was surprisingly good. I mean, as good as a burger or flatbread can be. I wouldn't mind coming here again as a replacement for other similar restaurants like Milestones or Bier Marktet."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, live music on Thursday night and finished with lobster Mac and Cheese Sandwich.  What a great pick for a dinner spot while on Busn trip."}
{"text":"Soggy fries, soggy burger and soggy weather! I know they can;t control the weather but it only added to the poor experience I had here. My two kids found it rather unappealing. Yet another nail in the \"all gingers are bad\" coffin"}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday lunch and tried the bison burger (good) and chicken lettuce wraps (ok). The server was friendly and helpful. This would be a great place to drop by for drinks. I like that it's a smaller establishment. Also love the small booths along the window."}
{"text":"Excellent eatery and bar. As mentioned by others the pulled pork sandwich is a must try! So,is the tomato salad (in season). Simple food, fresh ingredients, always good service. On the pricey side a bit but it is Oakville after all."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to check this place out for a while now and finally got the chance last night. We had a late dinner after a movie and being a Thursday lots of places were closing their kitchens soon. I called here and their kitchen was open until 10 pm. 
We got here and literally got the last seat in the house! It was packed, and 9:20pm on a Thursday night. We didn't realize but every Thursday they have a live band that plays from 8 to 10 p.m. The restaurant is smaller than it appears on the outside but it has cute decor and the staff is very nice.
For drinks I got the vodka Cosmo and my boyfriend got a vodka highball, decent for the 4.50 price tag. I ordered the veggie burger with salad and he got the turkey slider with the soup of the day. The burger was seriously amazing, the patty was fresh and delicious! Crispy outside and the perfect mixture of ingredients inside. The only complaint I would have is that the horseradish like mustard needed to be more evenly distributed. I got a few bites that was just overwhelming. The salad it came with was huge!! And the salad dressing was so good!! My boyfriend really enjoyed the turkey sliders, and his soup was carrot, apple curry and it was a top notch, so impressive.
I wasn't too into the band but I wasn't in the mood for loud music after a loud movie. If I were searching out live music then it would have been great.
I would def recommend this place, high quality food, I hope they keep it up!"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place and when we used to live out in Oakville, this was our go to place before we moved away to the east end of the GTA. We really miss it and so when we were just back in town the other day, we had to go there for dinner. We really enjoyed our meal and decided to give a review: for starters we had a soup and the fried hot banana peppers and for the main courses I had a super tasty pulled beef sandwich called the cowboy with a side of sweet potato fries and my wife had the sliders, and for desert we had an amazing quinoa based brownie. Everything was great including service. We wish had a place on the east side of the GTA with such creative and tasty comfort food. The only bad part was leaving for a long drive across the city with major \"itis\". All in all, we highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is rated highly for a reason! Great food, ambiance and pricing. I would have paid a lot more for my meal than charged! Everything was very fresh, and while I don't usually talk about salad dressing, it was the best I have ever had and really needs a mention. The chicken was so fresh and delicious, bacon on everything (awesome!), and so many great option to choose from. Definitely coming back, and wholly recommend!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, nice, small pub-like atmosphere. It wasn't that busy on a Monday afternoon so our food arrived quickly. We ordered the chicken poppers and 3 sliders with salad to split between the two of us. Both left full. 

Happy hour special was half price starters with purchase of an alcoholic beverage which we took full advantage of. The chicken poppers were delicious along with the sauce they were served with! We enjoyed the sliders as well. All in all we would pay a repeat visit to the Gingerman, if not only to taste those delicious poppers again! Recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is so frickin awesome. I always have the same kind waiter with brown hair and glasses (i dont know her name but she is so nice) ANYWAY literally any time i put the food from here in my big mouth i am absolutely shook. 10/10 best place ever thank you"}
{"text":"Cozy, mature crowd with an easy atmosphere. Ordered the lobster crab dip and chicken poppers. Dip was awesome but the chicken was freezer burnt and bland. Drinks are well made with $4 drink specials on wine and cosmos. Great place to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"This is place is great!

They have a fantastic beer selection, featuring local microbrews and imported beers. Standard stuff is available in bottles. 

I went here three times in two weeks. The food was consistently good and fresh. Everything was made in-house. The quinoa Thai chicken salad was AWESOME, and if I ever figure out how to make those cashews, I'm screwed. They're delicious! 

The staff is awesome. Super friendly and welcoming. They really seem to take the \"social\" part of the name seriously."}
{"text":"This was our first time trying this restaurant out. The food selection is simple yet there is something for everyone. I felt like trying the bison burger. It was very tasty. I ordered it as is and was nicely surprised. The meat was juicy yet well cooked. 
We also had the chicken poppers, a lighter version of a chicken finger. The tuna tataki was also fresh - could be ordered as a full meal, the size is big. 
Service was very good as well."}
{"text":"Pretty cute spot!

We ended up here because we were trying to go to the spot across the street - but it was full! I'm not disappointed as I ended up with a great meal at a decent price. 

There is lots of booth seating in here which is THE best - I am always a fan of the booth. It really is a cute place - very clean and well designed, with a large centre bar and lots of TVs. 

The menu has something for everyone without being overwhelming (can't stand a large menu) and a decent (not fabulous) beer list. The sandwiches all looked delicious, and I was able to try two of them - both were great! They also had a great soup of the day, which was a tortilla/Mexican soup, and my side (sweet potato fries, what else) were great - they are the battered on the outside perfect on the inside kind! Only annoying thing was having to pay for a chipotle dip, that should really be included with the fries. 

Random side note: why is the music in the bathroom SO LOUD?!"}
{"text":"I ate here during their grand opening.  The food and staff were terrific.  I had the pork loin entree.  It was VERY well cooked, tender, moist and medium rare.  The service was quite decent.  I will definitely return on my next regular visit to Oakville."}
{"text":"Everything we've had here is delicious!  It can get crowded on Friday and Saturday evenings. Also, if you show up on a Saturday morning, brace yourself for the moms-with-strollers crowd."}
{"text":"We were on our way to the Oakville Midnight Madness event and decided to grab a quick bite to eat before heading to the festival. This eatery is about a 15-minute walk to downtown Oakville and you can park on the street for free. The place was packed on Friday night and we were seated on the small patio (there's not a lot of tables inside either). My husband ordered The Flying Beaver burger with AAA all beef patty and portobello mushrooms with Yukon fries, and I got The Yale with AAA ground chuck, bacon and blue cheese sauce with a house salad. The burgers were grilled perfectly (not overdone or undercooked) and you can tell that the meat is of great quality. Their Yukon fries were crunchy and super delicious, although the side order of gravy was quite runny, it was more like an au jus than a gravy. I could hardly taste the blue cheese sauce on my burger which was disappointing, and my bun was still cold. The house salad was served with a sweet honey mustard balsamic vinaigrette. The service was ok, but because it was a busy night, the waiter accidentally took my husband's plate away even before he was done eating. They were definitely in a hurry to get us out of there - which l didn't appreciate at all. There are a lot of other restaurants to choose from in Oakville and I will be going to another place next time."}
{"text":"Didn't love the Cali club. The avocado purée on it tasted off and overall the sandwich was dry and bland. My salad also had pieces of slimy/rotting lettuce leaves in it."}
{"text":"World cup spot. 
Chicken poppers 13 so so
Smokey bison sliders 4/each really good tiny cute burgers 
cracked dry ribs 10. tasty 
Draught beer from 4 ~10
Tons of  TV here. 
Love the logo and motto : Eat love relax"}
{"text":"Food genuinely deserves 4 stars however servers lack of attention dragged my review and experience down to a solid 2. 

Asked server if bar was able to craft a bloody mary since one was not listed on the menu. She asked do you mean with \"tomato juice\" I replied yes. Server states bar could make it how I like it since it would be custom. So, food and drink were placed...and the wait begins.

*Let me preface: order was not written down

My hubby is served his draft beer, meanwhile I wait...and wait watching the girl servers carry on personal convos while they stood around. Food is now up and we begin eating before asking my server about the bloody mary. She has a blank stare and replies she totally forgot about it. 

Given up by this point I simply order a draft from the menu and continue my meal.

If staff cannot memorize a patrons order I suggest a notepad to write em down."}
{"text":"Come to Gingerman's with an appetite. The burgers are enormous. I ordered the Yale burger ($15), which is topped with bacon and blue cheese. It comes with some greasy fries. All in all, the food was average. It's not anything special.

I came here at noon on a Tuesday and the restaurant was empty. Other patrons didn't start showing up until around 12:45pm. The two wait staff were nice. You can watch at least one TV from any angle in the restaurant, so I enjoyed my burger while I watched tennis.

The cook said some interesting things, like how the bacon sucked (the one he was using to make my burger) and how the hand-wash station wasn't convenient. Just saying... I wouldn't voice these opinions while patrons are in earshot distance."}
{"text":"I don't get it, I really wanted to like this place based on previous reviews. Nothing was really bad, but nothing was really great either. 

I got the Yale burger with a side of salad. Patty was kind of overcooked and dry, but the blue cheese was pretty tasty. Salad was a wee bit limp. 

Service was pretty good. Dude at the bar and the waitress was pretty chill. Prob. wouldn't go back unless I was in the neighbourhood and just wanted to watch the game. At $16 bones for a blue cheese burger, I would prob. check out another joint. I would def. give this place another try if they could tell me what I gotta try out here."}
{"text":"Can't really go wrong here, on another day I may give it a 5 star rating. Would strongly recommend the LGC sandwich. However, the sandwiches, burgers, and soups and salads are all very good based on my experience. 

Good place to grab a lunch and a beer. TVs over the bar, but tons of places to sit and eat and have conversation."}
{"text":"Great place.  The menu was very interesting, especially the lobster grilled cheese.  The cocktails were very innovative, and were often made with fresh squeezed juices.  The clientele are a mix of talkative folks from the surrounding wealthy neighborhood.  The only issue I have with this place is a more general criticism of the poor craft beer scene in Ontario.  For as much as Canadians love beer, they seem to gravitate toward  bland and malty brews, and get this, Coors Lite.  I am glad I brought some Michigan IPA's for my hotel room stash."}
{"text":"Very cozy, cute restaurant. If you come in the evening after dinner they sometimes have live music. Food is excellencent, you're looking about spending 25 a person. They have burgers, sandwiches, wraps and salads."}
{"text":"wow I'm so glad we came here!! When I saw the name of this restaurant/pub, I wasn't quite interested... but my boyfriend was craving pub food.

Loaded Caesar $10 was soooooo good. A teenie bit spicier than \"Mild\" and it was so delicious!! LOVED every sip. Definitely my #1 caesar so far ;)

We had:
- Lobster & Artichoke Goodness $13 - basically nachos with spinach & artichoke (with lobster) dip. Very nice! Lobster chunks were NOT a lot.
- Lobster Grilled Cheese (LGC) $15 - I thought the Italian multigrain bread took away the yummy filling by its thickness... so we didn't quite like this one. Not enough lobster chunks either.
- Portobello Mushroom Flatbread ($forgot) - sliced portobello mushrooms on warm fllatbread, plus watercress I think? It was quite delicious although very simple! 

Service was excellent. But there was only 1 waiter serving eventually 7 tables! When the restaurant was empty (at 5pm) that was fine... but at around 6:30 (when it came to ask for the bill) it was very very slow...

I'd love to come back for Appy Hour (3-5PM) and the After-Dinner menu (9pm and after?) which are secret menus until you visit! (well... I just couldn't find it online and they weren't written on the paper menu)

Lots of booth tables for intimate dates."}
