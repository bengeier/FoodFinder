{"text":"Not sure what's up with this place?  I have driven by 3-4 times in last two weeks to get some wings to take home and it's been closed every time and phone is disconnected.   Not sure if they haven't got everything up to speed yet or what their issue is.  Perhaps the owner can respond here to let everyone know what's going on."}
{"text":"I am rather bummed. They were closed during business hours... step it up guys. I was really looking forward to their wings."}
{"text":"This place appears to be closed.  Every time I drive by the place is dark and I believe there is some sort of real estate sign in the window.  What a bummer.  I liked this place.  :("}
{"text":"We went to this place twice during posted business hours and it is closed.  Don't waste your time.  What's worse is they accept online order and payment but when you get there it's locked up tight in the middle of the day no sign to explain.  This place can suck it."}
