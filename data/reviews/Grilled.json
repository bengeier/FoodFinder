{"text":"Me and a few came for a quick lunch and were very pleased. The resturant was clean and bright. Our server was very attentive, and made us feel very welcome.  The food was very reasonably priced, compared to other resturants similar to Grilled, and portions were great.   The fries could of used some seasoning though.  They have a great selection of shakes, that were very tasty."}
{"text":"Yuck. My daughter's tiny grilled cheese sandwich didn't even have any butter on the outside, so it was basically a dry, barely toasted grilled cheese. My sandwich was no better. The homemade chicken noodle soup was absolutely awful. On top of the strange taste, it had few noodles, gristly dark meat, and the broth looked like greasy dishwater. The new owner was nice, but unless they get someone in the kitchen who can actually cook, I don't think this place will be open much longer."}
{"text":"New owner just had the grand opening. Super nice guy and the staff is awesome. 

Very cozy and clean.

We had an awesome lunch today. I had the Turkey Revelation which was really yummy with a tangy sauce.  My wife had a veggie wrap. We shared some tabouli which was out of this world. Then we took home a Tif's Pizza which was this super thin crust zesty dish which we saved for dinner. 

We love the place and will be back."}
{"text":"The name is now Melt Cafe and under new management.  We had gone to the grille once and it was bad but decided to try it out today because of the new management sign and close to home.  My daughter and I went there for lunch today and a couple things.  I ordered a turkey sandwich and homemade chips.  Cost is $7.99.  The sandwich was pretty small and they didn't fill the rest of the plate with homemade chips. Definitely not worth the price but tasted good.  My daughter had a greek salad and wouldn't you know there was a hair in it.  I didn't complain just let the server know they should wear hairnets...lol!  He didn't even ask to refund.  She ate about half of the salad.  The waiter was very nice and said he has been there for about a week.  Overall the prices are to high for a little place like this. Needs to adjust price or make portions bigger.  Hopefully the new management will figure it out. I don't think we will be going back based on todays lunch."}
{"text":"Sorry to say I give them 2 for concept not for the food.
Small place-seating for maybe 20 total. 
I was there on a recent Saturday night. The help was pleasant but it took over an hour to have a simple grilled turkey sandwich and a grilled Portabella which came out cold.
Their signature meal Mac and cheese was not available because they did not have the pasta made yet. 
The price was reasonable for the two sandwiches but they were nothing special.
I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Well, hello you little cup of creamy tomato soup, you. Aren't you just friggin' delicious?

This little grilled cheese haven is hidden in a little corner of an Avon Lake plaza, which is a shame. It's really good! 

I wouldn't really compare it to other Cleveland grilled cheese spots, seeing as this place is much more traditional. I would like to see the use of much more fresh/local ingredients, but for a quick lunch stop, this place is muy tasty.

We stopped by around 3:30-ish and it was really empty. As I scoped the space I noticed mish-moshed the furniture and decor was. I think it was a probably a cheap solution to a more expensive option, but still--it came off haphazard rather than quirky. 

The service was attentive and well, almost overly so. A sugary sweet waitress took our order from the table and we soon received two, piping hot, huge sandwiches. I also ordered the tomato soup and the bf ordered extra onion rings. The rings looked a little burnt, but the soup was divine! My steak sandwich had homemade cheddar cheese sauce on it, but it was really salty. I love salt, but my tastebuds got tired of eating this mammoth thing about halfway through. I think next time I'd try a different sandie--trust me, there are plenty of options. The bf seemed to enjoy his steak 'wich with tons of provolone cheese, mushrooms and peppers. 

Overall, the price is pretty spot on, the portions are large and the food is good. You've got plenty of options and the other problems previous yelpers mentioned seemed to be remedied. I'd come back if I were in the area again!

Oh, and free Wi-Fi for a working lunch! WOOOT!"}
{"text":"Just okay.  Very small lunch crowd, although we were a little early at 11:20; but there were still just five of us at 11:50, which says a lot about the quality and/or quantity.  Much better places around."}
{"text":"I am giving Grilled a four star rating because of the food. There are some issues with service time and available menu choices. My daughter and I went for lunch during a week day. There was only one other table occupied at the time. The menu consists of variations of a grilled cheese sandwich, soup, salads, and burgers. I had the Washington Turkey Club-Apple butter, turkey, bacon, and honey mustard. I had cheddar added. My daughter had the Feta Burger. Both were awesome and tasty. We were told to be sure and get a milkshake. Which I did. Again very yummy. Now for the negatives. Although we were the only other table occupied it still took a while for the waitress to take our order. I originally wanted the Dark Chocolate Chip milkshake, but some of the ingredients were unavailable. After about two to three choice declines due to unavailability I finally ordered the Chocolate Peanut Butter shake and added banana. Sooo good. So, even though I was a little frustrated over the wait time and menu choice swaps-I was more than satisfied with the end product. For me to say that is high praise indeed."}
{"text":"There is a new owner, a brand new ventilation system and a serious upgrade in quality.  I had a lovely grilled cheese on Texas toast with creamy tomato soup.  My daughter had the gooiest grilled fluffernutter ever. It was soooo much better than before  The shakes are still fantastic.  

So now this is a nice place to go for a hearty lunch or light dinner."}
{"text":"Had lunch there with 2 other friends and everyone said that there sandwich was very good. I had the Chicken Tuscany which was quite yummy. Not to much pesto and just enough cheese. It came with a cup of very good \"dry\" cole slaw. We will definitely go back for more"}
