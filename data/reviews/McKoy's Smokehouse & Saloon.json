{"text":"The food was very average. I just don't see the draw to this place. We went on a Friday night and the place wasn't crowded but it was full of bikers and loud folks. Smokers on the patio and a huge dog (brought along by a guest) stared us down the whole time we ate. He even lunged at my husband. The ribs and chicken were dry, as was the Mac and Cheese. The upside is our drinks were great. So I'd say go for drinks, skip the food, don't expect any sort of civility from guests."}
{"text":"Found this place via Yelp and it was also mentioned in the Charlotte city guide
1. Atmosphere is good - its a bar / BBQ joint - doesn't try to be fancy and thats good - beer, BBQ, sports, etc.
2. I got the sampler that had the pork, pot roast, ribs and chicken with the mac & cheese and green beans - portion wise its enough for two people but it was the only way I could sample everything
3. Ribs were good - tender but didn't fall apart - pot roast was interesting as it first time I have ever seen that - chicken was chicken - the pork was disappointing - I have made better pork myself. I expected a lot more from a southern BBQ joint - just didn't have any flavor.
4. Sides were good, but nothing that was jaw dropping
5. Service was speedy, pleasant and friendly - that was good all around

Overall, I expected more from this place and left thinking that the ribs were the best thing I ate, but overall I was a little let down."}
{"text":"The smoked chicken wings were amazing!!! The barbecue sauce with buffalo and Carolina bbq were my fav, but garlic parmesan was great too! Local beer was on tap, fresh and super hippy - yum!!! Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I'm from barbecue country so I did not come here for the que. I got a 3 sides plate: IT WAS FABULOUS!!! The greens were flavorful; the mac & cheese was great, & the okra was on point too! Large portions, fair pricing & good service makes this a \"will be back again\" place."}
{"text":"This place is great! The pulled pork was fantastic and the portion size was much more than expected. The pulled chicken was equally as great - dare I say better than the pork? We'll call it even. The atmosphere is exactly what I pictured. Wooden interior with a nice bar and plenty of tables to choose from inside. They also have an outside deck as well. As far as the staff, they were very welcoming despite my group being from out of town and top it all off...the pricing is very reasonable. Absolutely check out this gem if you have the time."}
{"text":"Stayed at nearby Best Western. Key cards have an ad for McKoys, which is across the street, and are good for a 10% discount. Excellent food with large portions. Outstanding pulled pork! Comfortable bar setting."}
{"text":"Went to mckoys the other day for lunch after running some errands. The place is huge and it smelt fantastic walking in. Had the nachos for app and also had some of their wings and ribs. Overall, I found it to be ok. Not bad, not great. Definitely better BBQ spots to go IMO. would consider going back for a second try sometime in the future"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this past weekend before heading out on a motorcycle ride. Ordered the omelet and hash browns.  This is probably one of the best breakfasts I've had in quite sometime in Charlotte.  The staff was friendly and very good.

Holding the 5th star for the second visit."}
{"text":"Food and service was great then got verbally attacked in parking lot by manager and or owner. We spent $60 plus and enjoyed the food so they should realize they are in the service business and get over themselves. Mac' Speed shop looks better now"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  Fantastic food great ribs .  Great service .  You really need to stop by and check out what they have cooked up"}
{"text":"Found this place off Woodlawn while trying to find something new to try in the area. From the start, the atmosphere sucks you in to your typical southern sports bar. Waitresses aren't over friendly which I can't stand at most bars. They take your orders fill your drinks and don't flirt for tips. Now to the food, great taste reasonably price and something for everyone. The fried squash pulled this place from 5 star status with an overly greasy deep fry. But do not walk out without trying Mac n cheese. This place would be a great place to read my new short story. Chain Smoker. Purchase from Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004Y6572C"}
{"text":"The food in the restaurant smelled great but I ended up leaving without tasting it due to poor service.  I was seated outside and waited a long time while at least two waiters came outside and never acknowledged my presence.  I don't want to throw the race card but I do wonder as I was only black person there besides my sister.   One waitress looked our way and then went to service another party who was seated at least 7 mins after us.  Wasted my lunch break!!
 
One star for great smelling food!"}
{"text":"Ordered the pulled chicken sandwich with mac and cheese. The chicken was a bit dry, but was well smoked and the mac and cheese was good. Service was great! Worth coming back to and trying other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Really like this place. It has great decor. Outside patio seats  about 25 inside is very open with a bar. You can smell the smoke from outside. I recently had the BBQ sandwich and it was huge juicy and delish to put it another way it was awesome. They usually have specials so that is a plus. Servers are friendly and attentive. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We found this on a business trip and loved it. 3 of us ordered the Living The Dream (LTD) platter, and one a half rack of ribs. 
The LTD is a combo platter with chicken, pulled pork, ribs, and pot roast, with two sides. 
The ribs were meaty and flavorful, just right. The chicken was moist, not dry. The pull pork was traditional. The pot roast was unique. I've had bbq brisket but never pot roast. It was a unique and delicious choice. 
Everything had a nice smoked flavor. 
The portions were huge. No one could finish the LTD. I made a meal out of my doggie bag. 
The salads were crisp and clean. The mac and cheese was great. 
They had two sauces, a NC vinegar and a sweet mild tomato based. 
The reataurant is a bar in a log building, a bit dark. We ate on the porch. 
TL; DR - great bbq, good sides, nice ambience. We will return."}
{"text":"Get this yummy BBQ in your life!

It's biker but always good energy.

The macaroni and cheese will make you want to wander in the kitchen and shake someone's hand.

The ribs are the business and the beer is premium. 

Get there early, this is a local dive."}
{"text":"Delicious bbq! Mac-n-cheese was delicious too. Nice sports bar type atmosphere. Bikers are welcomed."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best, not the greatest, the Ribs were very good, st louis style.  The wings were very good grilled not greasy fried, i recommend the Thai Chili, its got some zing.  For sides Mac and cheese, very good and gooey and the sauteed mushrooms."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and great service.  Just the atmosphere I expect from an authentic BBQ joint.  Not fancy but good food at a good price!  Half price appetizers were a nice surprise."}
{"text":"Visiting North Carolina and wanted a taste of Carolina BBQ. Was not disappointed. The pulled pork is tender and juicy without being fatty. Hit it with both kinds of sauces provided at the table. Yum! Also staff was so friendly and welcoming. It must us feel like locals!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Must try the pot roast, and, mac n cheese! Service is awesome, very friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place hundreds of times over the years and finally decided to try it. On the recommendation of my server I ordered the pulled pork plate with a side salad,  mac 'n' cheese and dinner roll.

Salad was unremarkable - not much room for creativity in that area. Mac 'n' cheese was tasty and a good-sized portion, but the pork was unremarkable. The menu made a big deal of it being smoked over pecan wood, but to me it didn't taste very smoky and it was kind of greasy. Two kinds of sauce are offered - the traditional Eastern Carolina vinegar style, which didn't have much tang and a tomato-based version which tasted like nothing more than ketchup. Dinner roll was dense as if it had too much flour.

There are great places to go for BBQ in Charlotte. To me, McKoy's ain't one of 'em."}
{"text":"The shrimp and grits are divine!  Our group had several different kinds of BBQ and it all was delicious. We WILL be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing smoked BBQ! The Living the Dream platter is awesome; ribs, chicken, pot roast and pulled pork.  The fried squash and mac & cheese are great sides. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Honestly one of the worst dining experiences I've had. You can tell this being my first review ever I don't do good or bad reviews, this was awful. They had good reviews, were busy on a Monday night, and it had my type of vibe inside. That being said my wife and I each ordered wings with a side. No alcohol, no appetizers, just a dinner. An hour later the food comes out. I understand a wait, that's fine. There was a big party outside. Buuuttt after an hour I got barely lukewarm wings with the lovely addition of a 16\" curly hair on two of them. Waitress was visibly flustered all night and it took us another 10 minutes to get silverware and napkins. $40 and an hour and a half wasted. I feel bad posting a review without talking to the manager, but I just wanted to leave, nothing short of giving me a lot of money could've made it better.

This all being said the waitress mentioned they had a bunch of new cooks. Do not discount this place completely, I think it was just a bad night. The okra and cornbread were very good. However I would give them some time to figure stuff out before visiting."}
{"text":"Almost a Dive
Had \"Smoked Pot Roast\" Not much smoked flavor. Frozen \"Sweet Potato Fries\",\"Sauteed Green Beans\" had very little flavor and the \"Country Steak\" was almost ground with a very greasy gravy. Service was mediocre at best. We were there on a Saturday afternoon and they weren't busy so things could have been much better if they tried. Assuming they have the skill to do better."}
{"text":"McCoy's smokes their own pork barbecue! 'Nuff said. Ok, they are friendly, too. Plus, the NCAA games are on the tvs, a delight to these ACC fans. Rarely have I felt so comfortable in a restaurant/bar in a strange city (we got stranded in Charlotte due to winter storms in the North-east)."}
{"text":"Ahhhhhhhmazing!! Best BBQ I've ever had! Sat at the bar...friendly crowd, great service and trust your waiters/waitresses!! They were able to make the perfect recommendations!!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"For BBQ...it is right at the top.  The pulled pork and mac and cheesy was delish.  My fiancee and I split a pulled pork sandwich, mac/chz and a bowl of soup.  Somehow, we still had some pork left to take home to the pups.
Lunch service was VERY fast and that's appreciated.  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here. I really enjoyed it. Good atmosphere, great food and friendly atmosphere. Definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful option to experience local flavor and neighborhood feel. The outdoor patio was perfect for a warm early Fall evening. Lots of big screen TVs and choices to watch your favorite game. The Beer was priced right (Great Specials) and the food was spot on.  I had the pulled pork barbecue, and the portion size was extra generous. The Fixins (sides) were prepared perfectly. Highly recommend the collards! Service was prompt and courteous, and you could feel the local ownership in the commitment of all of their team. Definitely a restaurant I would come back to again, solo or with friends."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is good.  The sweet tea is decent.  The BBQ is meh-ok, certainly not the best I've had in Charlotte.  The service was below average.

The big benefit is that this place is close to the airport, so if you need a BBQ fix when flying in or out or CLT, this detour is only about 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff and fantastic food. Pulled pork was amazing and the Buffalo Chicken soup was a pleasant surprise.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been stalking this place for a while, and finally stopped in. It's just off of my route to work, and the peaked roof has been mocking me from a distance. Tonight my wife suggested it, so we went. And it was exactly what I expected--which is a good thing!

The atmosphere was laid back, to say the least. None of the pretentiousness you would find at Mac's Speedshop nearby. But McKoy's could probably use a little updating.

Anyway, on to the important stuff--the food. We started with fried green tomatoes. I followed that up with a barbecue platter that came with 2 sides. I selected mac & cheese and collards. The mac & cheese was outstanding. The other food was very good, but fell short of great. The barbecue was juicy and tender, but didn't have as much smokiness as I expected. Both types of NC sauces are provided on the table--eastern and western. I'm an eastern guy, so that's where I went. Again, it was very good, but not great. The bite of vinegar was definitely there, but I missed the red pepper kick. The collards were done right, again above average.

Overall, I was pleased with McKoy's, and look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Great Service. The pulled pork is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Went here for an early weekday evening dinner. Service was a bit slow and they were moderately busy. I got the smoked wings and they were excellent, highly recommended! Pot roast entree was so/so and potato salad average. Prices seemed a little high but not too bad."}
{"text":"The ambience is great at this place. Service was great and don't let me get started on the food. I stopped here on a layover and found the place on this app needless to say the reviews given were on point.   I haven't had smoked wings in a really long time and the ones at this place were superb. The sauces were good, not too heavy on the wings, and the cooking was thorough on the wings. I have to stop again by CLT, I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork I've had in town. Juicy and not dried out like most places. Shrimp and grits also good. Place was very  cozy and comfortable, Service excellent"}
{"text":"Menu is kinda limited... My steak was under cooked but all in all good food and service. Just make sure you are not seated in the back. Jukebox and video games made it hard to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Great food, even better service! Ribs were juicy and had a good smokey flavor. Fried Squash was crisp and delicious. Lots of TVs to watch whatever game is on."}
{"text":"Looks a little shady from the outside but it sets the mood for a fun dine. Great wings and pulled chix and pork sandwiches. Fries - good. Beer is local and cold. Great spot for a bite when you are traveling or when you need to wind down."}
{"text":"I would like to start by saying that the entire purpose of this review is because I am sitting at home and like a good warm blooded American I want macaroni and cheese. Looking through the reviews somebody recommended McKoy's, that somebody should be prosecuted. Their mac and cheese sucks. That being said their bbq is delicious, the ribs especially. Get you some good ribs just skip the mac and cheese and you'll be alright. Now, on to my search... You're welcome world."}
{"text":"Best grilled wings and blue cheese. Get them double grilled. Ribs and Mac and cheese excellent too. Going back before we leave Charlotte on Sunday. Here for the ACC game. Go Noles!"}
{"text":"Eh, I'm a bbq snob and this place was just alright.  Prices were decent, but nothing to write home about.  We split the half rack of ribs and got a good number of sides including the mac & cheese, green beans, potato salad, pinto beans, collard greens and sweet potato fries.  Now the green beans were amazing-loved the pan seared taste.  The potato salad was fresh and had great flavor as well.  Everything else was just plain and nothing special."}
{"text":"Great place!!! We are from out of town & stopped by cuz of the great reviews. Thanks to EJ we got the shrimp & grits.....so gooooooood!!!! Also got the double charred wings yum!!!! So burnt & delicious. Stephanie our server was super awesome too very friendly & attentive."}
{"text":"Love this building. Great service. Very casual. My wife got the Fried Chicken breasts, big boned, little meat, they were flat on top like the breast had been trimmed...?  I got the full rack of St Louis ribs. Not impressed considering a $34 price tag. Both items were dry, overcooked... Sides were good.  Spent $80... Disappointing overall..."}
{"text":"I stay at hotels in the area while on business because of McKoys. I know others do the same. Every item on the menu is good. Staff is friendly and hard working. My favorite place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great food and a great value. You can defiantly tell this place is a local favorite. The pulled pork platter (probably enough for two sandwiches) with two sides and a half chicken with two sides plus six smoked wings as an appetizer was only $40. The wings are amazing and so are the sauces. If you're passing through, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a tasty, quick lunch, McKoy's is for you. Food was excellent (I ordered the pulled pork platter) and the service was friendly. I placed my order and within 5 minutes, I was ready to chow. Highly recommend. I bet this place is great for watching sporting events or having a cocktail at happy hour. Two thumbs up!!!"}
{"text":"I was a McKoy's last week for my second visit.  I had the Shrimp and Grits both times and they were amazing.  Great service too.  The first time I was there we were with a large group of about 20.  They were very accommodating.  Last week I was by myself and the service was just as good."}
{"text":"Hubs and I discovered this place last year while on a visit in Charlotte. Let's just say it was so good we came the very next day before our flight home. Wings are amazing, pot roast was juicy and delicious and the ribs were out of this world. Not to mention, they wrapped up another rack of ribs for us to take back home to California. We're traveling back to Charlotte in a few weeks and this will definitely be our first stop!"}
{"text":"Wow! Exceptional bar b q and fixins. Everything was good and if in Charlotte with a hankering for local cuisine with a noisy but fun eenvironment and good service, this is the place"}
{"text":"Was not a fan of the pork plate. Pork was dry and not ver flavorful.  Ambience was upbeat.  Bar was hopping.  Bbq in the south should be better than this."}
{"text":"I visited this place last night for dinner.  From outside it looks like a biker joint but its really a popular place for bikers and white-collar folks just alike.  I saw plenty of people there in casual attire and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves.  On to my review.....

Jennifer was my waitress last night and she was very sweet and welcoming.  I started off with an order of Buffalo Wings.  They offer different sauces to go with the wings and I picked the Buffalo Sauce.  I thought the wings were very good.  The sauce was right on point IMO.  Just enough heat to keep you honest.......  The Blue Cheese was creamy and simply great!!  They also came with sides of celery and carrots.

For my entree I had a 1/2 rack of their St. Louis style ribs with a side of mashed potatos and their green beans.  Everything was delicious!!  Ribs were big and meaty and you definitely got that smoky and sweet taste.  The green beans were sauteed in butter and garlic mixed with some chopped sweet peppers.  It was very good!!

Overall I thought this place was good and I would go back.  Only reason I dont give it 5 stars is because I think the place could use some updating but maybe it would take away some of its character if they did........ So who knows....."}
{"text":"Came here from Ohio found it on yelp. Brought my girl and her 4 year old daughter who also loved it. Thought it was going to be slow service being that it was bike night but it was great, prompt service by friendly staff."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm no BBQ connoisseur, but this place has pretty good pulled pork & BBQ chicken. I still prefer Mac's. It would have been better if my sandwich bun wasn't stale & falling apart. Sides- Mac & Cheese and fried squash were awesome. Laid back atmosphere and good service are a plus. Patio size is decent too. Might be back if I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Saturday night around 9. Ordered the Sampler. Here was the MAJOR issue, which can be changed easily: the salsa and jalapenos  meant for the nachos crossed paths with other items and the juice made other items very HOT. I don't want jalapeno juice on my good. The potato skins were good as were the garlic and parm wings. Wings were a little dry. Chicken tenders were a throw away item. Chicken nachos were ok as well. I wasn't overwhelmed by anything and wouldn't order again. The waitress didn't put lemon in the water and forgot again when asked a second time. In fact, she seemed rather annoyed when we had a request."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Colorado and decided to try Mckoys with my family. It was a very special occasion for my family since i havent seen them in over a year. First off the server gave us an extra plate which had a very foul order. We waited for over 15 mins to get our drink orders another 30 for the server to take our food order and sadly another hour to get our food! The food was decent good portions but at the end of our meal it took another 20 mins to get our ticket. I told the server we were really in a hurry and she responded with \"well im busy\" needless to say my family and i will never ever go back!!!truly disappointed!"}
{"text":"We've driven by here plenty of times and finally stopped in tonight. Definitely will be back! All the previous reviews are dead on regarding the service. The staff are some of the most attentive we've ever had in a restaurant. They make sure you're taken care of but don't hover which is perfect to me. The food is equally amazing! Smoked pot roast is delicious, fall apart, full of flavor. I had smoked salmon and the taste of the grill was so right. You get a hint of smoke but not too much and the fish was cooked perfect, not dried out at all. Mac n cheese, green beans, fried squash was all from scratch, queso dip is their own twist with some spinach in it but better than most I've had. The only negative was the beer could have been just a bit colder. Hubby got the OMB copper and it was cold but not the ice cold he was hoping for. He guessed it was at about 50 degrees and could have been closer to 42. They don't have a drink menu but have a full bar so they can make pretty much anything you could want. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We came here last year and we tried alot of dishes but we must say there wings are the best! Everything else was yummy too! We'll be back in the area next week and we will be going back!"}
{"text":"Why five stars? Food quality ranged from very good to great. Sport bar / southern salon atmosphere. Best smoked wings, really, they figured it out. Mac & cheese rocks, too. Pulled pork done right. And the patrons seem pretty darn happy. Pricing is reasonable, and portions are generous. Nice variety of beer on tap (including Guinness)."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and am going again tonight. The smoked wings are off the chain and it's a sin to cover them in sauce! Dip on the side instead! Everything was awesome including. Mom's peanut butter pie, OMG! I even got a t-shirt to make sure I remember the place, here on business from our of town but I will find more business in Charlotte so I can come back. Heck, it's worth a road trip from FLA!"}
{"text":"Excellent experience! Best wings I've had in a long time; all grilled, not fried! Excellent, friendly, and attentive staff and nice sports bar environment with plenty of TVs. They were happy to find the game we were looking for and get us in front of a TV to watch it, no problem and happy to do it! Glad we tried it out on our weekend in town!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times and I like it every time.  The parking is limited, but the food is worth it for the most part.  The blackened chicken sandwich was my lunch choice today.  It was bigger than I expected and worth the $10.  It took about 15 minutes to get my food, but it was lunch and the grilled chicken was pretty large... bigger than the bun.  The fries where just ok.  The service at the bar was ok.  I had 1 more bite left of my sandwich by the time I was asked if it was ok.  My soda was empty before refilling.  It wasn't that busy so she could have been more attentive, but she was ok.  I will definitely be back to try another new item."}
{"text":"So. Yum. We were recommended to go here from a friend who visited 5 times while he was in town so we had to try it when we arrived. Luckily for us our hotel was only two blocks away. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich. I didn't realize it was going to be hot (spicy) but I didn't mind. The ranch that came with it was perfect. Husband had the pork sandwich. Amazing. I want to go back."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of state and so glad we popped in to McKoy's. We were greeted immediately by very friendly staff. Our server Stephanie greeted us and answered all our questions about portion sizes, menu items, and the beers on tap. We had the nachos with pulled pork as an appetizer. That was amazing. For dinner I had the half rack of ribs. I have no idea how anyone can eat a full but it is done often they say. My daughter had the rib eye and luckily she shared some. It melts in your mouth and very flavorful. My wife attempted the item called LTD for Living The Dream. There was so much food she barely put a dent in it. It was delicious and she is glad she has enough for lunch and dinner tomorrow. No exaggeration. When we relocate here next month, we cannot wait to make this a permanent location for us to visit. Thank you all."}
{"text":"The best pulled pork in Charlotte and great collard greens! Mac & cheese is awesome as well. The eastern bbq sauce is perfect. The fried squash is fantastic. 

If you love wings this is the place. They smoke them and then finish them on the grill, never fried. Best wings in town hands down."}
{"text":"excellent, smoky bbq- great cole slaw.  dive like atmosphere.  could definitely see Guy Fieri hanging here"}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Best BBQ I've had in Charlotte, and there's lots of great BBQ here. Ribs were full of meat with great smoky flavor. The sides (sweet potato fries and mac n cheese) were great too. My friends had the pulled pork and the meatloaf and those were great too. Wanted to try the coconut pie but just didn't have any room. Next time definitely . . ."}
{"text":"i love this place been going for years!!! food is great beer is cold what more could you ask for..."}
{"text":"Lived in Charlotte going On two years and first time visiting this place! It was a Friday night bike night and the place was packed and I was seated immediately! I got the KTD based on other post recommendations. I was pleasantly suprise when it came out it was an oversized plate of BBQ goodness! I could only eat half and I took leftovers home that was enough for a second meal! Definitely recommend this place and I will he back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few years, but food quality and service has gotten much worse recently.  Barbecue was greasy and ribs were fatty and full of gristle. Said something to our server and she didn't really seem to care. I made sure that was reflected in her tip.  It's her job to let management know about issues coming from the kitchen. I could understand if they were very busy, but the place was half full and the patio was empty. Won't be coming back anytime soon or spending my money here. Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Arguably the best vegetable plate in town - Mac and cheese, green beans, and fried squash are my favorite. Real food, not cooked from frozen. The whole place smells amazing so I would guess the BBQ, ribs, chicken, etc are great, but the buggies are so good I just get that every time. Kind of loud in there so be prepared."}
{"text":"Great food! I was looking for a place to meet a friend from the airport and it was super convenient from the highways and a great casual place to get some amazing BBQ. Only 9 miles from CLT airport!"}
{"text":"Great Place. Food was wonderful, you need to try the Pot Roast I know that sounds odd at a smoke house but it is great. I tried the Mac and Cheese, Pulled Pork, Ribs, Chicken wings, Chicken Salad, and all were great. I will stop in every time I am in Charlotte. And they also have great hiring practices, very cute  to hot."}
{"text":"Ok, not great.  Could be a four- or five-star place if the kitchen put more refinement into what they serve.  For example, the smoked pot roast is such a great concept, but it falls down in the execution.  They plate a giant, untrimmed portion of it, with huge bits of waste, fat, and connective tissue still attached.  Trim that thing before smoking AND again before plating, and you'd have a superstar dish that would win awards in town and inspire copycats.  It's got great flavor.  Plenty of smoke and beefy chuck goodness.  But don't make me do surgery at the table to find the edible pieces hidden among the waste.

Good sides here.  Service was so-so.  I doubt I'd come back."}
{"text":"Definitely lived up to all the great reviews...a-mazing!  I had the pulled pork platter w/mac-n-cheese and coleslaw...finished with peanut butter pie - oink, oink...fat & happy indeed!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT food and great service from our waitress, Emily! She was very attentive,  friendly, and helpful and we couldn't have asked for anyone better! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went in despite the fact that they call themselves a \"biker bar\". Indoor & outdoor dining is available. 96° temps chased us inside. About a dozen beers on tap along with a full bar. We had the smoked chicken wings and pulled pork sandwiches. Very good. Staff was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte for the weekend we decided to check out this place for some North Carolina bbq. The bartender was very friendly and told us how amazing the food here was. We were disappointed that a bbq joint didn't have brisket but we were told that the pot roast was amazing so we were good with that. We started with the smoked wings that everyone raved about...bar-balo and calypso flavor. They were okay, I've definitely had better. Couldn't really tell a difference in the 2 flavors. For our entrees we had ribs with Mac n cheese & loaded baked potato & pot roast with Mac n cheese & green beans. The ribs were tough and were hard to get off the bone. The pot roast was extremely dry and tough. The green beans were mediocre. However, the Mac n cheese was amazing. Probably the reason I'm giving an extra star to this place. We basically only ate the sides so you would think the bartenders would have asked if we liked the food. Anyway...if you want good nc bbq I suggest not visiting McKoys and drive a few more miles up the road to Midwood Smokehouse."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch and was pretty happy.  I had the Shrimp Diablo Sandwich lunch special.  It was really good and surprisingly had much more shrimp in it than i expected.   I know this place is known for its BBQ but i wasn't in the mood a huge plate full of food ATM.  Portions sizes are huge by the way.  My friends both ordered BBQ platters, small ones, and they were not even close to clearing there plates.  Would i return, YES!  Really cute wait staff also!   ;)"}
{"text":"The sides are good, mac n cheese and fried squash. Definitely should skip the country style steak. I had decent flavor but was paper thin compared to other places."}
{"text":"The food here is AMAZING I had four sides and my husband had two different kinds of wings and they we're great. Service is top notch and very clean. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!!"}
{"text":"I'm saying best bar b q in Charlotte with awesome wings and cold beer. A few craft on tap and lots of bottle. Great tv all over the joint  even on the patio. Get yourself here !"}
{"text":"The food was great. Definitely worth the money. Service and atmosphere were just ok. I will be eating here again and recommend to anyone looking for good BBQ."}
{"text":"Good, solid joint. Good BBQ, great sides, espcecially the fried squash. Beer specials, and a full bar. Fun vibe, a few bikes but not a biker bar."}
{"text":"Just left this place and it was absolutely amazing from the customer service to the food! I ordered the sweet bbq wings with the sauteed green beans as I was just trying to stay healthy and it did the trick - healthy yet delicious! Our server Sammie was super sweet and the owner Ryan came over to introduce us as well as wanted to know our dining experience. I will definitely be back and can't wait to try their famous mac and cheese (maybe on my cheat day:-)"}
{"text":"Place was crowded at lunch today. I literally took the last parking spot. Had the Thursday special pulled Bbq plate with Mac and cheese and loaded baked potato. Nothing I didn't enjoy. Pretty good service. My drink was empty for a min and did have to ask for a refill (but it was super busy.)

Great Bbq place."}
{"text":"Very delicious! This was close to our Inn, and it was recommended. The food was good and good portion. We ordered the LTD for three people. With Mac and Cheese and fried eggplant for 3 people. It was so good! I liked the ribs and fried eggplant the best! The place was busy, so service was a bit slow. Even though our waitress tried her best."}
{"text":"Everything I've ever tried from here is fantastic! The wings are my favorite, though. Get them double grilled and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decent food -we had the BBQ pork sandwich w/okra. Fried tomatoes were served in a non-traditional style with bacon, however did not disappoint. Service was fair at best. Staff seemed stretched, though the place was less than 1/2 full. Roughly a dozen tv's on the wall that give a nice view/variety of sports options. It will not be my first choice if back in the area, but I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Only went once, so take this with a grain of salt, but it was amazing.
I had the ribs (half rack) and she had the pulled pork. Her pulled pork was slightly over cooked - which the guests at the table next to us assured was a real rarity - but that would be my only complaint. The ribs were superb, and the pulled pork was still really good. For sides I had the green beans and the mushrooms.  The green beans were really good, but the mushrooms were OUTSTANDING. Easily the best mushroom side I've ever had. I can't remember what her sides were but they were also really good (I think she ordered a salad for one of her sides?). Portions were perfect. Nobody should go home hungry. The big surprise of the night actually came when the group next to us recommended we try the fried squash. We were both full and I HATE squash, so we said thanks but no thanks. So they ordered us the fried squash as a surprise and I was absolutely blown away. I hate squash and I thought it was amazing. She thought the same. We wound up finishing the entire order while we were waiting for our check despite how full we were. With a beer each I think the total (incl. tax and tip) was roughly $30 a plate, but that's also with the most expensive stuff on the menu.

Highlights: The sides. The ribs were really, really good but the sides were just so good I could easily have pigged out on just them. They really made the meal. We tried some of the adjacent table's entree's and we thought the best entree ordered (out of 5 plates) were the ribs, and from what we understand that's the most consistent thing on the menu.

Hidden treat: Two here, not all that hidden. 1. Mushroom side; easily the best mushroom sautee` I've ever had, easily the highlight of the meal. If you like garlic even just a little bit, this is a MUST order every time. I know if I get the chance to go back I will be ordering the mushrooms again. 2. Fried squash; I can't explain what they did differently, but it came out crispy, salty, and just delicious. This is a must order for anyone who hasn't tried it, and I'll probably be getting that again as well.

Drawbacks: Man am I hard-pressed to find any. Parking was excellent, ambiance was excellent, service was really good, food came out quick, beer was cheap (at least compared to NYC-area prices, where I live). I guess the one thing I'd point out is that their house beer wasn't good. It was dirt cheap so it didn't bother me at all, but being that it's the house beer I feel like it needs to be said. That, to me would be the drawback. Don't order the house brew. As far as her pulled pork being over-cooked, since this appears to not be the norm I'll give it a pass, especially since it was still pretty darn good."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The staff is always very friendly and this place has the best wings in town."}
{"text":"Came in from out of town & am lucky enough to find this wonderful loud ,in a good way, bbq place . 
Sony our server was great!  The food was wonderful 
We started with the FGT , they were tastey but im in NC why is there not real bacon bits on them ? And dill dip really ? 
I chose the pot roast it was a great feast of wonder ! The 2 sides i choose 
Mashed pots were good and well seasoned , the slaw , once again i thought im in NC ,vinegar based yes ,? Saddly no , mayo based atypical slaw anyplace serves 
I asked Sony if i could get a little of their pork  ,that was awsomely tender and moist 
Over all. This place is a good place to stop and check out if your in Charlottle"}
{"text":"We were visiting from New Jersey and wanted to try out some BBQ food and my husband found this place I'm sooooo happy he did because it was out of this world. From the moment we parked our car and smelled all that deliciousness outside I just knew I was going to enjoy it. We walked in and I absolutely loved the atmosphere loved looking at all the pictures of celebrities that were there. We were waited on by Stephanie who was very very nice took our drink orders right away she was on top of everything! We ordered the nachos with pulled pork and it was a party in my mouth it was that good for our entrees my daughter had the rib eye steak with mac&cheese, my husband had the half rack bbq ribs and the meat was falling off the bone and me well I wanted a little bit of everything I had LTD Living the dream (picture added) it was big enough for two and I had mac&cheese as my side and if you love mac&cheese then you best get it cause it was beyond delish the pulled pork was my favorite with coleslaw oh makes my mouth water as I'm writing this lol.... Dessert I had fried cheesecake it was really good little too much for me but I managed to eat it but my daughter she had the coconut cream pie and OMG I'm so getting it next time ... So needless to say I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic!  We had wings, pot roast, chicken, and ribs. All were great. The wings and pot roast stood out. Super friendly staff and great vibe. Tried other BBQ while visiting Charlotte on other trips and this is hands down the best."}
{"text":"Visited this biker's \"saloon\" while visiting Charlotte. It was great! 
The staff was so friendly, they went out of their way to explain the menu to us out of towners. They even brought us a small sampler plate of sides to let us taste their homemade goods so we could make up our minds on what to order. They were out of bbq pulled pork on a Tuesday night, so this was one of the only odd things. I'd figure a bbq joint would have that at all times. They doubled us up on their bbq pot roast, which was a huge serving. The chicken could have been a little more moist, but the ribs made up for that. 
Mac N. cheese - look no further. This is the bomb.
Worth a visit for sure."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp.  Glad we did.  Awesome fried chicken and sides!  Service was great too."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to McKoys Smokehouse & Saloon located right off of I-77 in south Charlotte, NC. 

This smokehouse, with both indoor and outdoor seating, reminds me of what a local BBQ joint should look like with wood interior, BBQ paraphernalia on the wall, and loads of TV's.

We chose to share the Living the Dream (LTD) platter, a combination of ribs, pork, pot roast, and smoked BBQ chicken with sides of mac n' cheese and fried okra. The St. Louis style ribs were great, not fall off the bone as most BBQ restaurants serve, but with a little pull after the bite like KCBS competition ribs. The smoked pot roast was different, something I've never eaten. 

Dora here. While we were contemplating the menu, I remember commenting that I wished they offered a combo minus the pot roast. But, no matter. I gobbled the pot roast down first! :) And look at that crusty bark on the mac & cheese! Yummy! I'm really not a fan of okra, but their crispy vegies won me over. (Sorry, no pic.) Even with two of us eating off this plate, we still brought home a leftover container with enough meat to make a pot of chili. Sa-weet! ~Ernie & Dora Hiers, Fiction Faith & Foodies Blog"}
{"text":"This place must have 4 stars from bar customers. The food was awful! Bar b q was fatty and tasteless, collards were tough, fried okra was ok but hard to ruin that. Paid extra fir a piece of cornbread and it was some kinda smoked cheese. Not cornbread. So disappointed as live in Fl now and wanted a NC meal."}
{"text":"Used Yelp and found this place. Awesome food! The ribs are meaty and delicious. I liked the cole slaw as well. Food and service were excellent.  This place is so good that I went again for lunch before leaving town. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Really yummy bbq! The chicken was a touch dry but had great flavor. Ribs and pulled pork were awesome! Okra a bit too salty, but still good. Mac & cheese outstanding!!! Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"When here for lunch got seated pretty fast . We ordered are food it tolk 45 mins to get are food and the waitress wasn't  very good  she would say she would be right back tolk 15 mins every time  she was to busy talking to others.  Other people got there food first . Don't get me wrong it's a o.j. place if u got time to blow.  We mit or mit not be back ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Helpful wait staff. I got the LTD (Living the Dream), which is a sampler of ribs, BBQ pork, pit pot roast and smoked BBQ chicken. Mac and Cheese and Sweet Potato Fries as sides. Liked the ribs so much that I took some home to my wife (we live 3 hours a way - the smell in the car beats \"new car smell\" every day). 

A tad expensive ($29.99 for a full rack of ribs). The LTD was $22.

I'll skip the sweet potato fries next time and might get a double order of Mac and Cheese. The wife liked the green beans I got her.  I liked her leftover Mac and Cheese. I'll probably just get the ribs next time.  Half a rack is more than enough.

I was going to give this 4 stars for the price, lackluster sweet potato fries, too much fat on the pot roast and a tad bit dry on the chicken, but the Mac and Cheese makes up for that extra star!"}
{"text":"We stopped in here on the advice of Yelp, and the proximity to the CLT airport. Very, very glad we did, as the experience was very good.  First of all the owners and staff greeted and treated, us and their customers, as if they were family.  No kidding, they totally excelled at hospitality, with true sincerity, not that major chain restaurant sincerity of \"we have to do this, because corporate says so.\"  Second, when I asked the young lady, our server (sorry don't remember her name) what was good on the menu, she immediately shot out several of her favorite items and what the daily specials were.  She also asked if it was our first time to McKoy's, and quickly brought us a small sampler plate of the:  pulled pork, smoked pot roast, chicken salad, collard greens and Mac-n-cheese.  I had the Friday special, fried chicken with the fried okra and fried squash.  My girlfriend ordered the pot roast, with mashed potatoes and gravey, along with the mac-n-cheese. All the food that we had was very tasty and had I not had a hankering for fried okra, I would have had the collard greens, a dish this Northern boy never eats.  Our bill was $35, for the food, two beverages and dessert, including tax; which, I find to be reasonable now a days.  The thing that I like the most, is that the staff truly cared about their customers, and the food they produced, knowing that is what keeps people coming back. I will defiantly stop here again the next time I'm in Charlotte, NC.  Thanks McKoy's, good job."}
{"text":"Thursday's .50 cent wing night! Woohoo! That's what brought me to this place. 
Started off with the queso and homemade chips. Yum yum! The homemade chips were fresh and the queso was light. I didn't notice a lot of chicken  but a few shreds every few bites. The wings are huge and covered in sauce. Now my bf wanted ours double grilled....well that wasn't for me. They come exactly as it's worded on the menu \"crispy and charred\". No sauce (sweet BBQ) and nicely charred. My friend's regular ones had my mouth watering...next time next time. I just had to try the mac and cheese, of course. Oh dear gosh cheese! It was amazing! Get it! 
I sat outside with a party of 8 to watch a Thursday night football game. Which was perfect because they have two tv's and put on the sound. The service was good too. I'll be back for some green beans (heard they are great) and some regular bar-Balo wings!"}
{"text":"The food came out very quickly. Most of it was very good. My friend didn't like his food unfortunately. I'll be back"}
{"text":"I wish I could put zero stars. My husband got us ribs, pot roast and wings for New Years Day. The ribs were so tough I couldn't bite into them - (think Christmas vacation when they were trying to eat the turkey - Tough and dry!)  The wings were charred completely black and - one was RAW.  The pot roast was awfully dry as well. Oh and they wouldn't sell us black eyed peas on New Year's Day because - we ordered take out!!?!  The entire order went into the trash it was so bad.  Ordering from Mac's now. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious.  Service was great and menu was affordable.  Definitely a great option when you're craving authentic BBQ.  Just make sure you come hungry, portions were huge.  Do yourself a favor and don't leave without trying the Mac and cheese."}
{"text":"A little pricey for the shrimp and grits. The wings were some of the best that I have ever had. The new vinegar sauce is awesome and they need to sell it. The kids meal is enough for an adult."}
{"text":"We walked in around 11 and decided to do late night BBQ takeout. The staff was fun and friendly. The late night menu was pretty big, so I bet they have a lot of options during the day. We both got the pork sandwich with coleslaw. The meat was pretty normal for pulled pork, flavorful but not overly spiced. They offer sweet and vinegar sauce for the meat. The coleslaw was sweet and crunchy. The sweet potato fries were perfectly crisp and didn't get soggy even after 20 minutes. The French fries were really good too. I would go back."}
{"text":"Stopped in here the other day. I'm new in town so had no idea where to go. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. I had BBQ the night before so I just stick to a chicken club but it was one of the best club sandwiches I have ever had. And again, I'll compliment the service, my waitress was amazing."}
{"text":"Ate here for my mother's birthday because I had heard great things on WFNZ. The service was mediocre at best. Our waitress rarely checked on my table. When she did, she was short and didn't give us the opportunity to request anything. It seemed as though we were an inconvenience to her. The gravy on the mashed potatoes was bland and flavorless. My burger was the only good part of my meal. The \"crack-aroni\" and cheese, which I heard was their best dish, was just okay. 

All in all, I was not too impressed with McKoy's. I may give it another shot, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Food was lukewarm...Waitress kept running off..Macaroni needs work..Wings would be better hot not warm. . Price is crazy.. Go to Mac Speed shop instead wayyyyyyyy better food for less"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were just passing through Charlotte for the evening and looking for somewhere to grab a good meal and a drink. McKoy's did not disappoint! I enjoyed smoked BBQ chicken while the beau devoured some fried chicken. We enjoyed a selection of beers and great and friendly service from the wait staff! Highly recommended! Thanks to those who made our experience great."}
{"text":"This place seemed to be just another sports bar when I walked in. I then looked at the menu and there were better choices than just a sports bar so I'm like okay this could be good.  We ordered the buffalo shrimp and they were probably the best I've had. Then I got the \"small\" pulled pork with Mac n cheese and fried squash. Everything on the plate was sooo delicious and there was nothing \"small\" about it. Again another best I've had was the fried squash. Definitely will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Really good food! Great service.. No complaints! 

(But as a side note I think all restaurants should absolutely carry sriracha. That would have earned ya a 5 star ;) I put that sh** on everything! and it goes great with BBQ & Mac & cheese.)"}
{"text":"The meat is really good. We got the smoked wings and pulled pork. The meat is tender, flavorful, and really tasty. I ordered to go. The sides needed salt. The flavor was good, but tasted like the mac & cheese got the salt from the cheese and nothing added. The collard greens had no salt in them and the slaw needed salt and pepper. I also didn't get any BBQ sauce with my pork, which might be how they come. The fried squash was salted a little much for me, but still good."}
{"text":"Was in town for the night staying at the Courtyard Marriott Airport location and the bartender recommended McKoys. 

He was right on as my colleague and I really enjoyed it. Very relaxed, sports bar type, atmosphere. Grabbed a beer at the bar (tried the Copper which is a local brew and was great) while I waited for my co-worker to arrive and the bar staff was very friendly and attentive. 

For dinner I had the ribs along with fried okra and Mac n cheese and everything was on point!! Best Ribs I've had in a long while and the sides couldn't have been any better!! 

So if you're in the area and are even close to being hungry stop by McKoy's...you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"Food was good as usual. Sat at bar and bar tender was too busy shooting the ?);- with some girl to ask me if I needed another beer. I ran dry half way thru my meal. It will be a while before I come back. Very disappointing because the food is very good."}
{"text":"Their food is GREAT and service is awesome! From the point of entry everyone who walked by greeted us and said, \"We'll be with you in one moment\", wow way to go!!! Upon returning to NC we will visit again!!! A must, their fried green tomatoes with loaded with bacon and dill sauce (on the side)...WOW!!!"}
{"text":"WOW! The food was perfect! Messy, flavorful, good food! I ordered the Buffalo Chicken sandwich as I noticed both tables to my left and right all ordered the sandwich! Perfection! I had the collard greens as my side and those did not disappoint AT ALL! My husband ordered the pot roast with green beans and fried okra! It's a laid back atmosphere and you can go with your friends or family! Guaranteed good time and food! :)"}
{"text":"My service was great Sabrina rocked, the food was OKAY! But. It quite what I had in one. None the less it was good meal. 
Thanks Sabrina (Waitress)"}
{"text":"The Mac and cheese taste was delicious - tastes just like your grandmothers home made dish. Greens were just spicy not flavorful - in my book spice does not equal flavor. Barque chicken was decent. Cool spot to go to when in need of barque"}
{"text":"Was visiting NC and came to this place based on the reviews, and was NOT disappointed. I had a half a rack of ribs, and my gf ordered a dozen wings. Both excellent, the meat just fell off the bones. I'm used to having wings fried, but these smoked wings were excellent. The service was great as soon as we walked in, only stumble was they forgot her sides, but promptly brought them out. Fries were tasty, as was the coleslaw and mac and cheese. I'm no BBQ expert, but I would recommend this place. Also, they had a good variety of beers to choose from."}
{"text":"I've been to Coopers Old Time BBQ in Texas. Both locations. McKoys beats it. Yup, I said it. Wow! I had the Pit Smoked Pot Roast (lunch menu). Can you say Heaven? I did. Perfect. Color, texture, flavor. I opted for the Carolina sauce (vinegar based). It enhances the flavor of the meat as if that was even possible!! The sides were plentiful and delicious. I asked for the spicy pinto beans and potato salad but the star was the meat. HUGE portion (honestly we are on the road all this week so we stopped at a Flying J, bought hamburger buns and dug into the best leftover beef dinner we could've asked for later that night). 

My trusty travel partner JD got the  BBQ chicken and ate all but a smidgen of it. He says it was moist, perfectly cooked and just the right smokey flavor. 

Now the staff. Meh. As we walked in the hostess mumbled something and took off around the corner. JD told me \"I think she wants us to follow her\" so we did. Thank goodness she took us to a table and wasn't going on a break. She would've had two strangers hanging with her on her break. Our waitress was slow and we asked for extra napkins (which seems silly since it's a BBQ place so they should just bring extra). We never got them so we used the lemon from our iced tea and the table water to wash our hands. Hey, we make do.  So because the food was SO incredible- they get a 4.  A 5 would've been easy but the staff blew it."}
{"text":"We stopped here for dinner, while in Charlotte. I ordered the smoked pot roast, green beans, and okra. When they brought my food to the table half of my plate was smoked pot roast. I'm guessing it was atleast 16oz. It's safe to say I had enough to take home. The food was amazing and the atmosphere is really chill. Make sure to check this place out if you are looking for great food!"}
{"text":"BBQ and beer after landing at the airport. Kept me filled all the way to my work trip destination."}
{"text":"This is BY FAR one of my favorite spots in Charlotte!   Hands down, they have the best smoked wings I have ever eaten. They smoke them on-site and they have it down to a science.  They are served hot, tender, and perfectly cooked. They don't need sauce, but if you prefer sauce, they can hook you up!   We always pair them with stuffed potato skins.  Again, these are ahh-mazing!  

I love the casual atmosphere at McKoy's and the service is always great.  The bikers add some flair to the place, and when they book a band, it's a perfect night out!"}
{"text":"I ate 3 meals in Charlotte and this was the best by far!

I opted for a half-slab of St. Louis-style ribs with two side dishes.  Based upon the waitresses recommendation, I went with the fried squash and the green beans.

From bottom to top, here are my thoughts:

Green beans - too much garlic for my taste but I loved the freshness of the beans and that they had not been cooked to the point of mushiness.  Two bites and then I left them alone.

Bleu cheese dressing - a recommended accompaniment  for dipping  the squash and spot-on.  Perfect blend of creaminess and the slight bite of the bleu.  An appropriate amount of chunks of the stinky cheese combined with the savory flavor made this the perfect dipper for the squash.  They make this dressing in-house and it tastes like heaven.  Waitress was on the money when she recommended this as a dipper for the squash.

Fried squash - whoever thought this one up should be given a raise!  This is the first time that I've seen this dish offered anywhere but it needs to be everywhere.  The sweetness of the squash was accentuated by the crispiness of batter.  Also, the slight saltiness paired really well with the aforementioned bleu cheese dressing that my waitress recommended.  I plan to mention this dish to my favorite places that serve ribs in St. Louis in hopes that someone will pick it up and run with it.

The ribs - I love ribs!  I eat ribs in lots of different places to see how the pit masters interpret the pig differently.  These easily ranked in my top 5 favorites of all times.  They use pecan instead of hickory or a fruitwood and it makes for an amazingly complex and savory flavor.  Take a bite and your mouth waters for a second bite.  Take a second bite and the process repeats.  beautiful rub had plenty of flavor but the real star was the smoke.  There were a few different types of sauce on the table but not a one of them got within a foot of these ribs so I can't begin to comment on their attributes.

Go there - get the ribs!!!"}
{"text":"Very lively place with a band playing on Friday night. Service was good and food was okay. I had their \"signature\" ribs which I thought were over cooked. They definitely did not fall off the bone and were lacking in sauce. However, the sides were great! The collard greens were perfect and the Mac 'n cheese was excellent. I would go back, but I wouldn't get their signature dish."}
{"text":"Everything is homemade except chinken tenders or french fries, well who needs those with DELICIOUS mac and cheese plus homemade mashed potatoes.  Meatloaf was great, with a nice sauce on top.   All items looked like I should try them.  Sweet tea is really good, several good beers on tab in this bar atmosphere that has good eats.... there are homemade dessert, the peanut butter pie was so creamy with a drizzle of chocolate.  Service was quick and attentive.  Tad pricey for bar food,however, it is good food, could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Food is outstanding. I've been there several times and the negative is the inconsistent service. It's either great or it's horrible, there is no in between. Positive side is dang that food is goooooood! Examples include: buffalo chicken sandwich, country fried steak, mac n cheese, fried squash, wings, the list goes on and on. I haven't had bad food ever. However, if the food is great and the service is so so I'm less likely to return than if the food is ok and the service is great."}
{"text":"Ba Ba Ba BarBeQue is all I can say...
Being a NON PORK eater from the North it's no wonder why we never been here.
Our daughter Godparents who are very fond of the pig, came down for a visit and really wanted BBQ. We've lived here for about 4 years now and had never been out for BBQ so I looked to Yelp & Low and Behold this place popped up with reviews from some of my fellow Elite who I trust.

It was a rainy day when we checked this place out and as we ran to the door to enter people who were exiting looked Happy and FULL & begin to tell us \"Best Choice Ever\". Our guest were excited and asked a couple questions to the patrons. We were say in the back corner booth for our party of 6. 

My husband and I ordered the seafood fried with the squash. The squash was not as good as I read it to be, it had flavor with a lot of oil. The seafood was Meh ( I guess that's why it's a BBQ house not a seafood house ). Our guest on the other hand had Ba Ba Ba BarBeQue and they LOVED IT. 
I wouldn't go back UNLESS we have guest that want pork BBQ."}
{"text":"I have been to some of the best BBQ houses in the country and this is not one of them. I was on a business trip and this place came highly recommended, so my hopes were high. Unfortunately this place fell flat. They do serve large portions, it's moderately priced and the atmosphere is great. That's were it ends. BBQ is just NOT good. I had there sampler platter and everything on the platter was over cooked. I think I used half  a bottle of BBQ sauce just to get the meat down. Which  giving  credit where credit is due, the BBQ sauce they serve was very good.
I am sure there are great BBQ joints in Charlotte. So look else where before going here."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here. The food is amazing. Sam was our waitress she was amazing. Ryan one of the owners came by our table. Such a friendly guy. Told us a little history about the restaurant. The wings are amazing my husband got them double grilled. I had the pork platter with mac and cheese and spicey pinto beans all was delish. If you are in the area I would stop in. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Chicago girl says thank you! 
I wanted real NC bbq and man did I get what I asked for the cornbread is like crack! I can't wait to drive through here again! 

The smoke flavor was on point and it was so tender!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in Charlotte for 2 days and came upon this gem. The BBQ was beyond amazing!! The pot roast was tender, full of flavor. Pulled pork delicious as well. If we ever drive through Charlotte, this will become a stop!!"}
{"text":"As I write this review, I'm dreaming of the mac & cheese... Anyway, before I get even more sidetracked... Let's begin!  A few buds from work and I ventured out to grab lunch; craving some comfort food, we knew that McKoy's was our go-to spot. As a newbie, I was dubious of a great BBQ and comfort food location off the beaten path. Wrong, wrong I was! We luckily got a table really quickly, right during the high point of lunchtime. I was surprised by the mix of people that were eating.... From busy business professionals to old time buds trading war stories. I ordered the BLT wrap because well, how can you go wrong with bacon, and the mac & cheese as my side. It was fantastic! It hit the spot and exceeded my expectations. The mac & cheese was very down-home, southern style. Color me impressed and find me here the next time that I indulge for a  'cheat' meal! Very comfortable aesthetic and very unpretentious!"}
{"text":"Oh yeah, I'm a fan of McKoy's! If Mac's is a 5, this is a close 4-4.5 star! More of a true smokehouse/bar feel for me than Mac's and the food was almost as good. Ordered the pork platter which came with 2 sides...went with the mac & cheese and fried As Pourina mentioned, the mac & cheese is awesome! Went on Friday, which is also Bike Night, so it was cool to see all the bikes and hear the band while walking into the place. Made me miss my Harley...maybe again soon?!

Noticed a lot of people ordering the ribs too, which were huge, especially the full slab. Great mix of people too. Be prepared for the music to be playing loud inside. There's a nice patio too! My only issue was that they ran out of PBR, so I had to go with my second choice...the champagne...Highlife baby!"}
{"text":"I went in based on previous reviews. I had their garlic parmesan wings and a beer. Service was attentive and prompt. The food was great and the beer was cold. Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Great service - great food!  The pot roast is an absolute winner. Not your mama's pot roast...different with that hint of smoke flavor.They pay attention to the sides too.  The green beans were fresh and delicious.  Plenty for a take-home, second meal.  This is a \"don't miss it\" spot for sure."}
{"text":"Service is exceptional, Maddie is very professional and charming!  I explained I was not terribly hungry but wanted to try the quintessential Southern fried green tomatoes (with bacon & creamy dill sauce - oh yeah!) and BBQ so she suggested the 'matos appetizer then a side (collard greens!) and a cup of the pit pot roast - perfect portions and a great way to sample wonderful Southern flavors! And the cornbread was unlike any cornbread I've ever tried before, moist incredible flavor, indescribable but do not the dry crumbly stiff that needs to be soaked in butter and molasses or syrup just be palatable!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is only 4 stars... the double grilled wings are perfectly seasoned.  Oh my. The best . We had the barbalo and buffalo...smokey goodness.  If you are in the Charlotte area 10-15 minutes from the airport please stop in.... they have a whiskey,... clyde Maze is super duper smooth. Get in a whiskey sour or straight, unbelievable. Knock your socks off good.. okra was good. The string beans are better...stop by. Great service from Caroline."}
{"text":"Great food must try the wings, Mac n cheese and collard greens. Drinks are very reasonable and great!!! Overall the service is outstanding. I am a regular now."}
{"text":"I like Mckoys..........WAY better than Mac's!!

The wings are great nice smoked flavor on them and a good variety of sauces to choose from, not just your basic buffalo.

Ribs were Enormous!!! I had a 1/2 rack and they too had a great smoked flavor. I had a salad which was surprisingly good and the Mac N Cheese as the waitress put it \"Crack N Cheese\"...wasn't as good as the first time i had it, but still good!! 

Server was ok, not looking for a 5 star dining experience but still like it as another option for barbecue!!"}
{"text":"Omg, this place is amazing!! Best wings I've ever had, queso dip is incredible with the house made chips, and their Mac and cheese is just amazing!!! Their waitstaff is very quick and efficient, maybe a little to quick tho.. Stop and be a little more friendly ladies! Lol.. Great place, good prices, great BBQ, not TX, but almost!"}
{"text":"The food is good and cheap. We got dollar PBRs during a football game which is delightful"}
{"text":"Hours after we left we are still talking about those wings and ribs. Truly delicious, and so glad the portions were large so we could takeaway enough for another meal. Charming and informed service. A great experience!"}
{"text":"If you like smoked meats, this is the best place I have ever been to in the entire country.  We started with wings that had barbecue and hot sauce on them and they were outstanding.  I then had the pot roast that was difficult to pick up with a fork because it just fell apart so easily.  The smoked flavor in the roast was phenomenal.  We also had the baby-back ribs and half of a rack was plenty and extremely flavorful for my dining guest.  The owner came by every few minutes to make all was well.  Our server was very pleasant and service was fast.  The interior atmosphere is exactly what you would expect from a very clean, southern style smokehouse.  Istrongly recommend you stop by McKoy's."}
{"text":"I normally review based on dining by myself, but tonight there were 5 of us. All men and all big eaters.  McKoy's didn't disappoint any of us.  The portions were plentiful, reasonably priced and the service was excellent.  Two of the five were unable to eat all of the food on their plates.

Now let me tell you about mine.  I ordered the pot roast. I have to believe there was an entire chuck roast on my plate.  Not a serving of pot roast but the entire roast. Ample warning - be hungry if you order this.  It was perfectly cooked and delicious.

All of our meals had more than enough food. As I said, two of the five had food left on their plates.
Highly recommended!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! The ribs were awesome as well as the Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes! The only downside was that the TVS were extremely loud and it was hard to talk to one another. The waitress with black hair, tall light eyes was super sweet. Overall it was a good experience just wish it wasn't so loud in there."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Mckoy's for lunch after hearing there advertisements about their mac n cheese on the radio. Their advertisement actually states that it should be called crack aroni n cheese because its that good and addicting. Well..... they are right. It is super cheesy and delicious. I could of had a whole bowl of it. The menu itself is smaller then most smokehouses or barbeque restaurants, however the food was all tasty and fresh. The staff was very pleasant and courteous. The restaurant is extremely easy to get to. I highly recommend checking out McKoy's for dinner or lunch."}
{"text":"I can't look at any other wings the same again.   These blow any wings I've ever had out of the water.  I'm not sure what planet they get these chickens from but they are the meatiest wings I've ever seen.  They could tell me I'm eating cat legs and I'd probably be fine with it.  They are that good.  Oh and the mac and cheese is pretty amazing too.  Although the wings are my regular go to meal here, everything I've ever had here has been yummy.  The pulled pork sandwich and the meat loaf come highly recommended.  If i had one of these near my house I'd probably never eat anywhere else!"}
{"text":"This was a favorite lunch spot a while back when I was working a few miles away from there.  

The Pit-Smoked Pot Roast was so tender and bit smokey and hitting on all cylinders. The Mac 'n Cheese was pretty incredible as well. You can never go wrong with the Double Grilled Chicken Wings..."}
{"text":"I tried this place out, got something for my little ones and for myself, and I must say the appetizer sampler was pretty darn good. It wasn't next level and the wings did not farly impress me, but the service was pleasant when I went and it seemed like a pretty cool spot. Not much to complain about. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I spoke highly about this place after my first visit 3 years ago. After recently returning my thoughts have changed. The service was BAD. My food was .... not good. The wings were dry, the nachos were horrible. I doubt I ever go back. They also seem racist at this place. I don't mind tipping on to go orders but the way she made me feel I almost didn't even want to take my food with me. We ordered the sample platter to share and everything was pretty bland. Not as I originally remember."}
{"text":"I love wings. Always have. That being said, the juicy, smoked wings are the best wings I've eaten up to this point in my life. Waitresses are friendly, some ridiculously cute at the same time, killer combo.  Awesome bar, lot of regular types about, not transient crowds. Also they have Galaga, of which I'm obsessed with getting the high score on any machine I come across. Come here, eat the wings, tell me I'm wrong."}
{"text":"This place is flat out the best barbecue west of The Atlantic. I am not going to repeat what others have already stated, but my favorite app, the buffalo shrimp. Honestly, it is unmatchable. 

The entree selection is excellent but I like the pulled chicken and pork combo plate. It is smoked to perfection and served with off the hook sides. 

My son had the pulled pork. 

Lastly, the customer service here is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Food was great and price was fair for what I got. Server was ok that's the only reason I did not give it a 5."}
{"text":"Some delicious food and great southern hospitality. This place looks like an old tavern inside with plenty of TVs and various tables. A nice full service bar is along the wall. They serve some mean bbq and have lunch and dinner specials. I unfortunately arrived a little bit too early so I did not order any of the specials today (prime rib or seafood platter). 

I did happen to find a nice pulled chicken platter! I opted for the $2 surcharge for an additional 4 oz of chicken - 13 vs 9. It was super moist and flavorful! Opted for green beans and a side salad, both of which were fresh and tasty. 

Definitely some good eats going on here. Will return."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. 

I scored a hot lunch date with the lovely Amy C and we popped in for our BBQ Fix. 

We chose Thursday on purpose because the Nooner Special (love that the lunch specials are called \"nooners\") is their Pulled Pork with two sides. 

I opted for Mac and Cheese and Fried Okra. The mac and cheese was Ahhhhmazing. Pure cheesy goodness on a plate. The fried okra I could have done without...note to self always chose double mac and cheese!!! Not to be overshadowed the BBQ was very tasty too! And they were very gracious with the portions...which is always a good thing.  I RARELY.... if ever can't finish my food but today I needed a box. 

All in all, loved this place (once I found it..haha) and I look forward to coming back again! 

Mmmmmm.....BBQ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat and drink 
Thanksgiving special 19.99 turkey and dressing mashed potatoes green beans macaroni and cheese coleslaw"}
{"text":"We tried the smoked wings, pulled pork and ribs. Sides were macaroni and cheese and greens. The wings were smoky but not much other flavor without added sauce. The ribs were dry but had good flavor. The pork was good. The sides were the best part of the meal. The greens with the pepper infused vinegar had a sweetness and the Mac and cheese had the best toasted crust. No Samuel Adams lost a second star."}
{"text":"Gotta have the NC BBQ while in town!
Based on other yelpers reviews, we decided McKoy's would be the place to show us what NC was all about.
We had the LTD (Living the dream) platter and ordered double mac'n'cheese as a side. Then, for some reason we thought we should also order another half rack of ribs... with slaw and collard greens on the side.

Living the Dream (which is a bit of a sample platter):
The pulled pork was amazing. Especially with the slaw on top and just a bit of bbq sauce. The pit roast was also really delicious, but just a little fatty for my taste. The chicken was okay, but really paled in comparison to the pulled pork, the pit roast and the ribs. OH yahhhh... the ribs! Delish! They fell right off the bone and were so tasty. I added a little extra sauce on mine, but I am a saucy girl, after all.
The mac'n'cheese was ooey gooey deliciousness...and definitely not low cal. I had to turn the plate around so that I couldn't see them anymore. 
The slaw was tasty, not mayo laden at all and a great balance with crispness to the pork.
The collard greens weren't my favorite, they had a weird after taste...but not being from the south, maybe I don't know what I am talking about?

We then decided to really go for a full on heart attack and ordered the fried cheesecake. Yep, I said fried. 
Let me start by saying... I am pregnant and anything fried sounds delicious. Let me follow up by saying I only took two glorious life changing bites before laying my fork down. Gestational diabetes averted (hopefully.)
This thing is unreal... it looks like a deep fried cannoli with cinnamon, served with a heaping scoop of vanilla bean ice cream with caramel on top. But, you really don't understand until you taste it, it has that soft cheesecakey filling that is brought to a new level by the frying. My boss, who is about to run an iron man, finished the whole thing off.... do you get what I am saying??? He's training for an ironman and couldn't resist eating it all!!!! You know it has to be good, right?

So, this place is decadent and you will leave in a food coma. But, you won't pay much and the service will be typical southern hospitality. Now that's my kind of coma!"}
{"text":"Parking lot was full and no where else to park. We started to leave and saw some diners coming out to snag a parking space. We were seated right away and waitress was quick and efficient. I ordered the daily special which seemed to tale longer than usual to arruve. I was disappointed because it wasn't very flavorful unless I covered it 8b bbq sauce. I'll come again but order something else."}
{"text":"The food here was not that good and the ambience was just bad. Service took quite a while as well. I'd save my time and dollars go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I finally had the pleasure of trying out McKoy's Smokehouse last night, after hearing from many people of the restaurant's awesome BBQ menu. 

My wife and I got 20 wings to split, so that we could give multiple sauces a try (we're sauce people, don't judge). Side note: $.50 wing night on Thursdays during NFL games! Whoot whoot. We went with the buffalo, bar-balo, thai-chili & calypso.  Handsdown, my favorite was the Thai-chili, with bar-balo coming in as a close second. The wings were extremely tender, almost easily falling off the bone. They had a great smokey taste to them as well, which would be a little over-powering if you are expecting traditional wings where you just taste a sauce. Overall, these are some of the best grilled/smoked wings I've ever had!

Side wise, don't even waste your time with anything other than the Mac & Cheese. We made the mistake of ordering french fries, what a joke. $3.50 and they were about the size of a small order at a fast food joint. AND they weren't even that great to justify it. The mac & cheese, however, was a heaping mount of cheesy heaven."}
{"text":"The pork here is amazing. We were in town for a couple of nights and tried this place based  on the recommendations here. It did not disappoint. We sat at the bar. The atmosphere was nice and quiet. The service was fast and friendly. Oh yea, and did I mention how good the pork was? Yum!"}
{"text":"Based on the reviews, I really expected this place to knock my socks off. On one occasion I had the pulled chicken and it was too sweet, lukewarm and smokeless. Also tried the ribs and they were ok. The sides are quite tasty, Mac&cheese, sweet potato fries, collards and fried squash. I wonder if pork is their best meat?  May try yet again and order a veggie plate, but that kind of defeats the purpose of going to a BBQ joint...."}
{"text":"Mac and cheese brought me back to life!!
In a world where food resembles garbage 
This was the best meal I have had in a while!

It's like when sleeping beauty was kissed
Or like when spongebob realized he had square pants! 

Loved it"}
{"text":"ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?  

I have lived in Charlotte for 3 1/2 years and only ate here for the first time tonight?  I apologize to my tastebuds.  

Pulled pork, ribs, pot roast, chicken.....each one had an incredible smokey flavor and were cooked just perfectly.  I can't get over how excellent those ribs were....great bark on them, not too cooked down but not too tough either.  

Green beans and mac'n cheese were excellent as well. 

Even got dessert...best coconut pie and pecan pie i have ever eaten.  You can tell it was homemmade! 

Service was great, atmosphere was fun. 

Do yourself a favor and stop going to Mac's and make this place your go to (don't forget about Bobbee O's in Northlake too though because they still have the best brisket around)."}
{"text":"I am dissapointed. This was actually my second time here, and now I know why the first time was not that memorable. 

Service was great, and waitress was very nice. This review is about the food. I ordered the \"famous\" St Louis ribs, and they were so disappointing. They claim to be smoked, but these tasted boiled first, than put on the grill. They were such a let down. My side's were Mac n cheese, Cole Slaw and pulled pork. The pulled pork was tough, and lacked that pork taste. Pork should be packed of flavor, but this was not.  My other 2 side's were great. They saved this review from getting a 1 star."}
{"text":"Ate dinner here while staying at a nearby hotel on a business trip to Charlotte. Enjoyed their excellent pulled pork platter with two sides (mac & cheese and fried squash). Everything was very tasty and the portions were generous. Glad I passed on the larger portion of pork, I would not have been able to finish it! Tried both BBQ sauces on the table: one thicker and more sweet - like a Midwest Chicago/KC-style - and the other a vinegar-based Carolina-style. Both were good but frankly, I ate most of the pork without sauce. It was that tasty and moist. Ironically, the only thing I didn't get from the pork was much smoke flavor. It was there, but it was very, very subtle. Nonetheless it was a very good meal.

I washed my dinner down with a Mecktoberfest, Old Mecklenburg Brewery's outstanding version of traditional Oktoberfest beer. Speaking of beer, they offer a nice variety here, both on tap and in bottles. The vibe is \"sports bar\" with lots of TVs throughout the dining room. Since I was dining alone I appreciated this since it gave me something to do while waiting for my dinner.

Finally, kudos to the staff here. The place was jumping on the Tuesday evening I was there and yet the attention from my server was excellent. She checked with me regularly and the food arrived quickly. I noticed that all the staff, servers and managers alike, were really hustling to seat and serve people.

All in all a very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Delicious southern BBQ! We had pulled pork sandwich and BBQ chicken sandwich...hard to pick a favorite. Great atmosphere and service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a couple of days and was recommended to this place for great food and watch some basketball on tv.  The wings are delicious after the bar tender recommended the sauce.   I had the prime rib special and was amazed how great it was.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very good roadhouse style place.  The smoked wings are outstanding.  Service is also a big plus."}
{"text":"The BBQ was awesome! Have to try the smoked chicken wings. Good craft beer selection, but never can pass up sweet water 420 on draft."}
{"text":"Just really good. Great, friendly service. Pretty quick, also. I had the smoked pot roast. Hated to leave any on the plate. Fried okra was as good as you could want. Mac and cheese was super. Nice roadhouse atmosphere, with lots of TVs, for sports fans--but it's not a sports bar. You can have a quiet conversation, if you want."}
{"text":"The best wings I have ever eaten.  FIrst time visit with a group of co-workers.  Owner brought us samples which were awesome.  Ended up eating there twice just to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke.  I would  go out of my way to get back there and eat again."}
{"text":"I come here every now and then for lunch because it's convenient and the food is pretty decent, but the service is spotty. Sometimes they're great and sometimes they are pretty terrible. But I risk it for convenience.

Favorites there are their bbq sandwiches and their fried green tomatoes. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is a sports bar. Allowing for that, the food is excellent, as is the service. Exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"I went to McKoy's today for lunch, I don't know what made me happier, the fried squash that you couldn't touch because it was served so hot, the beautiful mac & cheese with the browned, crusty cheese or the southern, pork infused collards.  Along with the great food, we also had terrific service.

Another great thing about McKoy's is they are open in the middle of the day, that weird time when you don't know if restaurants are open. A great bar area and plenty of outdoor seating.  

I am just going to up my stars to five, there's just no reason not to."}
{"text":"This place works on all levels. The rustic sports atmosphere is welcoming when you walk in, as are the friendly staff. Upon sitting you browse a menu full of Southern favorites. The barbecue and pot roast are very tasty, and they have a great selection of side items to go along with your meal. These folks know what they are doing here."}
{"text":"mmmmmm....fried okra. 

Entering the restaurant was a little awkward since this was my first stop on my solo Charlotte trip and I had the intent on dining in. and I noted that it was a biker friendly bar. I guess I just didn't know what to expect. 

The restaurant is pretty busy, my waitress was attentive though so I never had to outright ask for service. 

What I ordered was LTD with the sauteed mushroom and fried okra. Everything was flavorful. But the ribs were a little dry for my taste."}
{"text":"DAMN!!! This place is freaking awesome! The atmosphere in general was great. The server, I didn't catch her name, was very nice and very attentive. The pulled pork was some of the best I have ever had. I got the pulled pork sandwich with fries and let me tell you... this was a little taste of heaven. The fries were crisp and delicious and that pork.... did I mention the pork? The cold slaw was also spot on (I like slaw on my sandwich). Also, they offered a vinegar based Carolina sauce and a sweet BBQ sauce. I typically don't care for the vinegar based sauce but the two together tasted great.

The people in the place were also a good group. My wife and I met some great people and if I was a local I would surely make this place a hot spot. I love BBQ and I love good beer and good times. This place offers them all. If I ever come back to this area I will get the LTD as I am a huge, HUGE fan of ribs and I also want to sample that Mac & Cheese everyone raves about. 

Also, the server was unbelievably hot! I mean super sexy. Not that it really matters... but I thought I would mention it anyway.

Bottom line: Awesome food, fantastic service and amazing BBQ!"}
{"text":"Really good BBQ. I'm definitely a BBQ fan. I was worried they would only have red BBQ sauce, which I don't really like, but they had vinegar based sauce also, which was delicious. Their Mac and cheese was also really delicious. It's baked mac and cheese so it's really a lot better compared to the soupy kind. The service was also great."}
{"text":"For what it is, this place is a diamond in the rough.  I'm a business traveler who is used to crap restaurants while staying in business park areas, but this place is beyond that.  

The atmosphere is what I would call \"tavernish\" - a few TV's and arcade games in the corner, but overall fun and friendly.  After sitting down at the bar and ordering a drink, I informed the friendly bar tender that it was my first time in the restaurant.  Shorlty after receiving my obnoxiously large bourbon on the rocks, I was presented with a free sampler platter of pulled pork, smoked chicken salad, collard greens, and mac- n-cheese, all of which was delish.  I started with the \"'maters\" (fried green tomatoes), and they were slightly above average for the South.  I then moved on to their \"award winning\" ribs - incredible.  The service here can't be beat, based on the attention I received. 

My rating of this place is based in the type of establishment, and the location.  Establishments of this caliber are few and far between in areas such as this.  Don't get me wrong, this is no substitute for a night on the town in Uptown Charlotte, but on business, and not feeling like heading Uptown, this is a great place.  Full of locals as well, which is of course a good sign.

The prices are good as well.  I had my starter, entree (with two great sides), two huge bourbons, and a beer for $50 before tip.  Many great sounding entrees were under $15 as well (not the ribs), so it could have been far cheaper."}
{"text":"I celebrated my birthday here and went during dinner. Surprisingly it wasn't crowded for a Saturday night. It definitely has a country, saloon feel with a laid back atmosphere. I ordered wings and macaroni and cheese. The wings were so delicious and are the best wings I've ever tasted and I'm a wing fanatic. The wings were grilled and had the perfect amount of char on them and they were full of flavor. The macaroni and cheese was delicious, creamy, and well seasoned. The waitress was friendly as well. I enjoyed my dinner and will be back when I return to Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ! Great place to bring the kids as well. Extremely friendly wait staff and quick service.  The BBQ choices were plentiful.  
Will definitely return to this BBQ joint!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at McKoys is more bat than restaurant. The food is good enough when there is nowhere else to go. I will say, the one thing that makes McKoys worth while is the deep fried cheesecake. I highly suggest getting the cheesecake, but cannot make any other recommendations. It's the kind of place my grandmother would have liked but not really my type of food. By my type of food, I mean flavorful, well thought, expertly cooked. I am not trying to be high flatulent, I dig me some comfort foods and classics, but McKoys is just average (at best). If you're in the area and don't want fast food, then head to McKoys. If you want a bar, head to McKoys. If you want really good food, drive further or get a ride and head somewhere else. Try Pinky's Westside."}
{"text":"We found this place by recommendation since we are from VA. This place is nothing short of amazing! The service was superior. The managers checked on us several times throughout our dining experience. The waitress we had was attentive and food came out really quick. It was a bit crowded because they had a country singer artist performing. It's loud. But a great experience

The food was AMAZING!!! We ordered the wing Bar-bola (Bbq and Buffalo sauce). They were awesome, fresh and just all around great. Hubby had the shrimp and grits. I don't even like shrimp and grits combination but these were GREAT! The macaroni and cheese you could tell was definitely home made and so were the mashed potatoes. Everything is actually homemade except the French fries and fried chicken tenders. I had the pulled bbq chicken sandwich and the sandwich was huge. Hubby and I split half of each other's food but everything was so good. I didn't know what I want to eat the rest of. 

All I can if you're ever in Charlotte come McKoys they really make you feel at home and comfortable! If I'm ever here again. I definitely will visit!"}
{"text":"I got the LTD and a side of wings. The wings had a great smoky flavor which was masked by an excess of sauce. The sauce was great, but I felt the wings would've been better served with less of it.

The LTD must stand for \"Leaves Tons (to be) Desired.\" The plate comes with two sides, roast, BBQ chicken, puled pork, and ribs.

The plate is freaking massive. It's a LOT of food. They pile it high with roast and pulled pork, give you four ribs, and 1/4 chicken (wing + breast).

The chicken wing was great, but the breast was VERY dry.

The roast was sawdust dry. I had a bite with a bit of onion which was presumably stewed down with the roast, and it wasn't half bad because the onion was moist enough to mask the uncomfortably dry roast.

The pulled pork was fair, but also a bit drier than I would've expected.

The ribs and sides were the highlight of the dish. The four ribs were packed with meat, and had a wonderful texture. I would've preferred a far more smoky flavor, but they were still good. They were also slathered with a decent BBQ sauce (more on this later). 

I got mac n' cheese (because the Yelp reviews praised it) and fried okra. I expected a bit more of the mac n' cheese. It's not that it isn't good mac n' cheese. It's above average, but not great.

The fried okra was pretty good, but it was a touch too greasy, and a touch too salty. If it had more crunch on the outside and less grease, then it would've been perfect.

So... 3 items on the LTD were too damned dry to enjoy without some sauce, and that's a shame because the sauce on the tables is, for lack of a better word, terrible. One is a smoky shade away from ketchup and the other is of a heavy vinegar base. The vinegar one wasn't bad. At the recommendation of one Yelper's previous review, I mixed the two together and had a halfway decent sauce on my hands. No idea why no one in the restaurant has put this together.

The wait staff was prompt, attentive, and friendly. Can't ask for more on that front. Maybe I caught them on an off night, but when I go back, it'll be for wings and ribs. I'm not interested in trying the roast/pulled pork again."}
{"text":"Went to this place last year. The BBQ was very good and will be a spot we always hit when we are in charlotte for vacation. Wish I lived closer to eat here more."}
{"text":"The ribs are amazing!!! Love eating here the staff is always great. The meatloaf dinner is one of favorite dishes. Everything here is great!!! I love the Mac and cheese as well as the wings!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte, NC we found this BBQ and Bar for lunch the service was great and the atmosphere warm and inviting. We ordered salads, ribs, chicken and pulled port. The portions were large for lunch and we all thought that the food was very good. 
Definitely worth visiting my again if we are back in town."}
{"text":"Oh dear lord I think this is the coolest place I have ever been too. We arrived in to Charlotte around 9pm and checked in to a hotel across the street and headed over to McKoys for food. As we had our 11 year old daughter with us we where a  bit apprehensive when we realised it was bikers night and the car park was full of bikers but we stepped inside anyway. We where greated by a server who told us they only had high tables free and would that be ok for our daughter and it was fine. Our lovely waitress Catherine appeared and despite the noise and the place full of bikers she made our daughter feel completely at ease. We ordered 3 plates of BBQ and the food was amazing. What we didn't finish we got boxed up and brought it with us. If your in Charlotte do yourself a favour and find this place it's amazing."}
{"text":"This place looks like a dive, so you know it must have great BBQ. From the diamond plate on the walls in the restroom to the mud flaps around the stalls this place oozes authentic Carolina. Outside, they have at least a dozen spots to park your motorcycle. Some kind of manufacturing plant down the street, a payday loan place, and a pawn shot ... so you know, a sort of edgy neighborhood that lends itself to authentic BBQ.  The server was perky in a laid back sort of way. We got the tater skins for an app and I had a BBQ sandwich. My wife had the fried chicken, mash potato's, and mac and cheese. We also ordered the cornbread. They even have fried cheese cake. So, we want to like this place. Unfortunately, the cornbread was cold ... I mean like it had just came out of the fridge. The mash potatos looked like the kind you get at KFC, and tasted about the same. The Mac and cheese, was lumpy, not creamy, and so it was also a looser. The fried Okra, was, well you know, the frozen stuff you get from all the places here lately ... definitely not home made. It seems that lots of restaurants seem to think that sides are just that, something on the side, and not really anything to get excited about, and so they order frozen stuff from their provider, and that is that. The BBQ was good, nice smokey flavor, and the fried chicken would have been good, but it was a bit greasy. All in all, I would have given this place two stars, but the servers really tried, it gets a 3. Another thing, the parking lot is really small, as is the dining area, and the place looks like it gets really crowded really quick."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly. The bar area was a bit crowded for my liking. Had a good meal and watched a game."}
{"text":"Grit patty app was delish, smoked, pulled chix was fab and ribs were terrific. Service with a smile too.  Great casual dinner."}
{"text":"Poor customer service.....seated about minutes with no service. Another party comes in get seated.  Order taken immediately.  I was a regular customer.   I will never go again, nor advise anyone else to go..."}
{"text":"Nice spot to slide in and grab some grub.  A little divey but worth a try."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! My husband and I had to come back! The food was so delicious!!! Amazing food! Amazing staff! The live bank and bikers on Friday night were great! Love this place! We need a resturant like this in California, where I am from!! Great food and drinks! The smoke taste to the ribs and chicken are delicious!!!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! My wife had to admonish me to not moan while eating. We split a LTD and all those meats were terrific. We also had the sautéed green beans, pasta salad, and sweet potato fries. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Great bbq, friendly service and a really chill vibe. I loved my bbq pork - and the attentiveness of the bar staff. Reasonable prices for the quality of food."}
{"text":"When i think BBQ, I think McKoy's.  Went last Saturday night at 8:30.  Although they were busy, we walked right in and were seated right away.  The BBQ plate with Mac & Cheese and Sauteed Mushrooms were yummy.  Reluctant to give it a good rating, would rather keep it to myself so it doesn't get too crowded, but I can't lie, it's good stuff."}
{"text":"One of the co-owners, ryan came up to us and explained that at minimum, the wings are smoked more than 4 hours and the other meats up to 16... the net result is falling off the bone mouth watering southern goodness for all the animals who gave their lives for my belly!  If you're a vegan vegetarian or doesn't wear a baseball had to supper. better choose someplace else. they have vegan beer and booze.  close to the airport and open late. nice combo.  didn't try the deep fried cheesecake but that's next."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've had in a long time. Service was pathetic. Food was actually ok but not worth the crappy service. Will NEVER be back."}
{"text":"Just traveling thru for the night and looking for good local food.  McKoy's has some local charm with sports tv's all around and 80's music playing.  We ordered cornbread, shrimp & grits, bbq sampler platter (LIVING THE DREAM) with Mac n cheese & fried okra.  OMG!  Awesome meal!  I would recommend this place to anybody!  In fact, it was recommended to us by Carol, the front desk lady @ Hyatt House Hotel."}
{"text":"Visited this place with a great friend.  Meatloaf and wings are fabulous.  Waitress was great.  Awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"The double smoked wings were great!  Fried green tomatoes were ok.  Fun environment for a couple having a casual date."}
{"text":"I really like this place, my coworker and I stopped in for takeout and ordered the bbq half chicken, mac n cheese and greens.  Everything had a good taste to it however the chicken started losing flavor after the first couple of bites, not dry or anything just didn't get enough seasoning for my taste.  I do plan to return to try the squash and some other things on the menu..."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!!!  We were in Charlotte for only 1 day and wanted BBQ.  We found this on yelp and liked the reviews   I had pulled pork which was good. My husband had ribs which were amazing!  The helpings were more than enough. The sides were extremely good. I had green beans and fried okra and my husband had fried squash and mashed potatoes.  Will defiantly come back if ever here again!"}
{"text":"Went here last visit to charlotte and plan on going back tom when i visit for the parmalee concert! Great bbq and great mixed drinks!"}
{"text":"Confession: I don't like Bbq, but I love it at McKoy's!!!!!

The half chicken was melt in my mouth, lip smacking good with a sweet and tangy bbq sauce.  In other places it tastes too smoky...here it was just right for me.

You get two fixins with the chicken...my green beans in white wine sauce with garlic were phenom!  Glad there was a healthier choice than just mac and cheese or grits.  

Service was attentive and courteous.  Multiple people looked after us...I prefer that over one waiter or waitress.

So why not 5 stars?   I don't want to mislead you...this is not fine dining.  A \"yankee\" might feel out of his or her element here.  I was fine because I was with locals.

Insider tip: go early, even on a weeknight.  I got a table no problem at 6 on a Tues, but by 6:30 the place was jam packed!"}
{"text":"Yes.  A nice BBQ joint complete with smoky, tasting meat and a great menu.  Our server, Abbie, was simply on her game and her experience shows.  It was nice to see a manager visit with us, too.

We went for the slow-smoked wings, fried green tomatoes (some of the best we've tried), and ceasar salad.  It was all wonderful and we can't wait to return.  We've found a serious competitor to both Max's and Midwood Smokehouse.  Q-City and Sauceman's have been left in the ashes of these BBQ power players, IMO."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food and 2 stars for the alcohol!! Def delicious ribs but slow service on alcohol and my Long Island wasn't good. But def a must go to eat!"}
{"text":"Portions were huge!! We enjoyed a combo platter of BBQ chicken and pulled pork which came with 2 sides we opted for the mac & cheese and green beans which were sautéed heavily in garlic!! The homemade vegetable soup was filled with meat. We didn't leave room for dessert so ordered a piece of coconut pie to go which was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Loved the food !!! The ribs were great ! Best fried okra I ever had. Service was very friendly ! If you are ever in Charlotte NC you have to go to Mckoy's. I know I would fly across the country from California just to eat here !!"}
{"text":"Living the Dream!!! Almost...

$25 for this humongous hungry hippo sized platter of four different kinds proteins:
BBQ ribs...I love ribs! But I didn't love these ribs...meaty, but were tough and difficult to eat off the bomb. Pass... 
BBQ Pot Roast...pretty good beef, but a bit chewy for my palate.  I need my meat tender...
BBQ chicken...good! Cooked perfectly.
BBQ pulled pork...good! Though its difficult to screw up pulled pork.  
The sides of Mac N Cheese and Collard Greens were delicious and spot on, though not any better than the rest of Charlotte's amazing BBQ joints.

Friendly service, casual Southern bar atmosphere, with a bit of a quirky local clientele...though that last part is just because I ain't from around here.  3.5 Stars overall so I'll round up to 4 Stars, but Charlotte has better BBQ spots such as Midwood."}
{"text":"McCoys was recommended by my local hotel as a great local restaurant. The shuttled dropped me off out front and I was seated by a wonderfully nice hostess. My waitress made suggestions and I went with the pulled chicken sandwich, fried squash, local Pilsner and coconut pie. The pulled chick sandwich was amazing! Fried squash was much better than I expected and the homemade pie was delicious! Great restaurant. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Food and service was excellent! Fried green tomatoes were good, but on the salty/greasy side. Ribs were fantastic, as well as the okra, cole slaw, pork, and more! Manager and server were extremely friendly, attentive, and our food came our extremely fast. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"It was Cinco de Mayo, so of course Nicole and Todd offered to take me somewhere to get BBQ. And being of the mindset that any BBQ is pretty good BBQ (generally speaking), I was only too happy to comply. 

We sat on the patio, so I can't really comment in the inside, but the place was hopping and the parking lot full. From the looks of it, they do a business here ripe with regulars, and there's no question the spot was festive if not rollicking that afternoon. Beer selection, while not breathtaking, was solid, and before too long I was pulling on a Yuengling, paired this day with pulled pork (when in NC, right?), fried squash (interesting, curious), and afterward, a taste of pie that the waitress described as 'coconut and pecan pie had a kid, sort of.' And that's pretty much what it tasted like in texture and flavor. 

In all, this wasn't the top 'cue I've had here, but I'd eat it again. Here's hoping there's another consumption holiday on the horizon to make that happen."}
{"text":"OMIGOSH! We live only blocks from McKoy's and somehow we forget about going there! Not anymore. We went Saturday night and had the BEST barbecue plates, complete with SERIOUS Mac 'n Cheese, fried okra. We actually had an appetizer for the first time - the Thai Chili wings, double grilled. Whoa. The very next night we ordered take-out - WINGS, again. They're my favorite wings ever. 

You gotta go! It's a bit of a dive, lots of bikers but Damn, the food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Great after work crowd, every thing smoked there is good. Even the soups have the smoked meats in them... yummy"}
{"text":"Decided to come here for lunch on a Thursday after a meeting. Parking lot was full... I guess that's good right? It certainly was right extremely packed bbq joint with plenty of tvs. Decided to share a plant of the smoked hot wings which were awesome cooked perfectly. For each day during lunchtime why have a different special. Thursday was pulled pork with two sides decided to get the Mac n cheese and spicy pinto beans but they have many more side dish options. My meal was a little to much for lunch but was perfect all around. Pinto beans were great the Mac and cheese was good but the pulled pork was awesome. Great spot for lunch and I assume even better for dinner. Definitely recommend if in The area"}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich and the Mac and cheese ! It was so good! Mac n cheese tasted just like my sisters homemade, yum!"}
{"text":"Do not come to a bbq place and get something else.  This is the lesson Mckoy's has taught me. I came here for the pub crawl and really wasn't in the mood for bbq.  I went with the steak sandwich ( yes I am on an epic quest for best steak sandwich in clt) and it bearable.  It could have been one of the worst I had in charlotte.  What redeemed it was the mac n cheese though.  Now, thats a good mac n cheese! I watched all the bbq and ribs come out and realized that I friggin messed up.  Everyone seemed to really enjoy their food while i wish I could find a flux capicitor and never order the cheese steak.  There were plenty of beer specials and the service was pretty good for the light rail pub crawl group that was there. I am giving this place 3 instead of 2 stars for setting, mac n cheese, and how good everyone else's food looked."}
{"text":"Pulled pork was great! Do know that when you say you want the large portion you are going to get a huge portion. Service was spectacular with at least four people asking if I needed anything else. They also call you sweetie and honey like a true southern restaurant"}
{"text":"The Best Arnold Palmer I've had since we moved to South Carolina. It's so fresh- I had the pulled chicken sandwich sandwich and it was amazing! The meat is smoked and just when it hits you know they aren't lying. The cornbread was slightly different than what I'm used too. It was cheesy and really good as well! A hit with my kiddos. We knew we made a good choice when you can smell the food from the parking lot"}
{"text":"This seems to be a biker bar.  It has a standard old school bar atmosphere.  Eating wings or ribs, it was pretty standard in a city where there is bbq like there are Starbucks in other cities.  The service was great & is a an awesome place to watch a game w/above par bar fare."}
{"text":"Really good barbeque. I had the pulled pork and my wife had the shrimp ans grits, both werw great. Service was friendly and efficient. Seems like it becomes a biker bar late, but it was fine for dinner.  I recommend it if you are in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Yelp :) Now when we travel, we find places to eat based on yelp reviews. 

We stopped in at about 9 pm on a Wed. The place was moderately packed and like another reviewer stated, one of the waitresses was hot :) 

If I owned a bike and lived from around here, I will definitely come here. They have biker parking right in front and a nice patio to eat at.

We ordered: 
- Pulled pork platter with Coleslaw & Collard Greens: The pulled pork was our favorite. The meat just tasted great. The coleslaw was good but nothing spectacular. I really liked the collard greens. Our waitress suggested the pork platter and she knew what she was talking about. 
- Rib platter with Fried mac & cheese and Fried squash: We weren't crazy about the ribs. They were drenched in sauce and the meat wasn't as juicy as I prefer. The fried mac and cheese was AMAZING! We're on a low carb diet but that went out the window for this mac and cheese. We both loved the fried squash. 
- Fried Cheesecake: Its fried and cheesecake...do you need any other explanation?!? 

All in all, if we see ourselves in NC again, we'll definitely stop by."}
{"text":"Read the reviews and was pleasantly surprised at how accurate they were. We ordered the LTD and it came to the table quickly and hot. It was delicious. Ribs, pulled pork, pot roast, and bbq chicken along with fried okra & squash. The portions were good and had to get a doggy box . It was dinner time and was busy. The wait staff handled it with ease. For the best smoked meat, McCoy's is it. Will definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Great food!! Great staff! Love coming to this place! They also have the largest patio ever!! Their best waitress is Caroline!"}
{"text":"After a whole day of flying from SFO to Houston and finally to Charlotte, my coworker and I were running on EMPTY. Since we had such a late flight, there weren't a lot of options left for a Sunday night dinner, but when we stumbled upon McKoy's Smokehouse & Saloon that boasted a four star rating and was open until 2 am, it was practically a no brainer to get there and refuel.

As expected, the restaurant wasn't very crowded, but for a Sunday night, we were surprised to find a decent number of parties enjoying a late dinner like we were. We were offered a \"late night\" menu that had basic BBQ sandwiches, platters, and various sides like fries, coleslaw, and salads. Starving, I chose the McKoy's hamburger with a side of mac and cheese.

Considering the lack of a crowd, I was surprised that the wait for food was a bit lengthy, but I suppose that just meant the food was cooked fresh. Presentation wise, the hamburger was massive with vibrant fresh veggies piled on a charred beef patty and a large bun. The mac and cheese was strangely presented like a hump, but it looked pretty good.

Unfortunately, looks can be deceiving. The one thing that lacked from the entire entree was SEASONING. How could a BBQ place be so bland? I'm not one to put ketchup on burgers, but my goodness, I practically drizzled the condiment ALL OVER my burger just to get the taste of something besides charred meat and bread. (Charred is putting it lightly; it practically veered towards burnt.) Then on top of the severely under seasoned burger was the mac and cheese that was coated with what felt like congealed cheese. Where was the ooze? Where was the creaminess? It honestly tasted like they used day-old cheese to coat the macaroni pasta. 

I walked in starving, so to be perfectly honest, my standards were quite low, but even then, I couldn't find anything in my dish to be impressed about. The only reason I gave this place two stars instead of one is because the service was friendly and the restaurant itself has a cool vibe. I'm not too sure where the \"saloon\" part comes in, but it's definitely a bar where you can watch any game imaginable on FIFTEEN television screens strewn all over the walls. 

Did I finish what I ordered? I was too hungry not to.
But was I that hungry that I couldn't tell McKoy's was an absolute disappointment? No way."}
{"text":"Me and a friend had lunch there today and it was very solid. Today's lunch special was pulled pork (very healthy portion) beans and 2 sides for $9.99. Great deal for some great bbq pork. I had the Pot Roast platter since they don't serve brisket. It was good but not even close to brisket. The go to side dish is baked Mac n cheese. It's awesome! The cole slaw was good too and mayonnaise based. McKoys also makes killer chicken wings. Make sure you get the twice grilled where they smoke the wings until tender then grill them to crispy up the skin. Outstanding!!! Some of the best ever wings!"}
{"text":"First order of business..lets talk about the macaroni and cheese! It's the best I've ever tried in charlotte! That statement even includes soul food restaurants that's I've gone to. The only downfall was that the food took a bit long to come out. We had a lovely waitress that informed us the kitchen was backed up but she kept coming back and letting us know it was coming. My sister and I shared the meat platter sampler which was more than enough for the two of us. I would definitely come back and would love to sample more of the sides. The spicy pinto beans are not spicy at all, no kick whatsoever. As an appetizer we did order the smokehouse wings, double grilled, so there was a nice chat just the way I like them. If I wasn't with my family who doesn't enjoy spicy food I would've tried a different flavor besides barbecue. My brother ordered the fried chicken and that looked good as well, two large breast and he didn't even finish one!"}
{"text":"McKoy's still gets a 4-star shout out and will continue to be a weekly (or so...) lunch visit, but I had the pit pot roast today (it was the daily special so I strayed from my beloved pork BBQ) and it was bleh.  Dry while somehow greasy and at least one third of my portion (maybe even 1/2) was straight fat.  I doubled up on mac and cheese as my side (it's been on of THOSE weeks that require a double load of carbs to add to my double big booty) and it was delicious and creamy and cheesy as always, but I will be striking the pot roast off of my list (why didn't I stick to the BBQ?!)"}
{"text":"Um YUM. My husband is a BBQ junkie and he loves Macs, it's his fave but this is my new fave. Their BBQ is juicier and their sides are WAY better than macs. Everything was so good, the coleslaw was just perfect. I'm hard to impress at any restaurant, for example, Ruth Chris doesn't impress me that much. But this place rocks. Great quality for the price. I did feel like a whale when I left but whatever. Food came out pretty fast too and we had like 12 people. Good service, they know how to run a restaurant. 

Love this hidden gem!!!!"}
{"text":"Not too thrilled with the menu or happy hour specials. 

Nothing really stood out on the menu. I was here with the intention on trying the wings and they were just okay. Not bad or anything but not memorable either. I've had better roasted wings in Charlotte. I tried my friend's fried chicken platter as well and it was decent. 

The hour hour specials were pretty blah. There's domestic beer specials and maybe a house or well cocktail / liquor type. It's more of a divey spot so you shouldn't expect a wealth of craft beer options and or fancy schmancy cocktails. 

I might give McKoy's another try, but wouldn't suggest this place as a go-to for wings."}
{"text":"Great food a bit pricey.  The corn bread different from what I have ever had delicious buttery.  The coconut pie was warm and gooey delicious.  The smoked chicken and wings also  good . Giving it a 4 star we sat in a booth and it was very uncomfortable and tight. The table is small for drinks and plates at the same time.  The staff was nice"}
{"text":"Service, sides and wings were fine. I had the LTD, all of the meat was dry. Probably some of the driest ribs I have had (happy that I didn't order only ribs. The food was not good enough to try McKoy's a second time."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much we went 3 times in a week.  It's a place you wanna go and just eat and enjoy the food and not worry about calories.  Everyone who works is so nice and welcoming.  It's kind of hidden and you wouldn't know if was there but it's a most to visit if from out of town."}
{"text":"Good place good food. Nice and clean place to grab a bite. Friendly staff. Have always been well taken care of here. Starts with the owners and managers who are good people"}
{"text":"Had a postmate driver deliver me this once. I will probably never eat here again. Not trying to be mean but I order the big man thing with ribs chicken, chopped Bbq, a few sides and their grilled wings. Born and raised right here, u have to come correct with the Bbq or don't call it Bbq, the mince/ chopped Bbq in my opinion wasn't Bbq, it couldn't have been slow cooked. They probably put it in a greasy pan add seasoning and chicken stock, wrap it and toss in a conventional oven for a few hours. That's not Bbq to me. Didn't fall off bone tasted liking boiled ribs with sauce on it. The grilled wings .... That shit was burnt. The sides tho, corn bread, mash tater, baked mac. On par only reason u got 2 stars n not 1"}
{"text":"Won't go back. I went because I was in from out of town and it was rated family and kid friendly. Whoever rated it that way didn't have kids. 

It was loud and raucous, not an environment good for a family with a kid. I'm 46, so it's not like I'm some young person. 

I had the ribs and they were undercooked, dry as hell,  and the sauce was obviously not put on per order. I've had better ribs from frozen."}
{"text":"No nonsense biker and sports pub that has, hands down, the best BBQ in the city. It's literally heaven on a plate. Go for the best collard greens and mac & cheese in town, too. Excellent, friendly waitstaff. Expedient, attentive service. It shows how much they really care. All my love!!!"}
{"text":"Great spot for a quick meal.  The bartender (Bre) has very good recommendations if your not sure on what to get. I got the chicken salad sandwich. Excellent recommendation. Thank You"}
{"text":"Form out of town and decided to stop here because of the rave reviews. So here goes. The ribs left something to be desired, they weren't amazing. However, the biscuit and pulled pork were pretty great. Extra bbq sauce is needed though. The fried okra is AMAZING, as is the fried squash. However the highlight was the fried cheesecake dessert, big enough to share with the whole table. Service was quite lovely as well. I don't know that I'd go there when I come back, but I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Fat juicy wings. Amazing flavor. Worth the price. Thumbs up! 
P. S. I'm a pro critic."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in Charlotte!  I always get the Pit Smoked Pot Roast with fried squash and mac & cheese.  It's the best!  Always good service and great food!  I bring all of my company here because they are never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Yum.  I found this place on a quick business trip to town.  On another Yelper's mention, I tried the wings...which were amazing.  I also tried the pulled pork, mac and cheese, and fried okra.  The pork was fantastic, served in a huge portion and complimented perfectly by the vinegar-based sauce hidden in an unassuming ketchup dispenser-thingy.  The mac was great, as was the okra--although the portion size for the okra was far too much...leading me to put too much of it into a body that doesn't like fried food too much.  I digress.  I will most definitely come back on my next trip.

BTW--a couple of \"Crown Royal Girls\" were roaming the bar on this particular eve, offering up free trial drinks of their new apple-flavored blend.  Barf.  Why did they even bother asking me if I liked whiskey (which I do)?  This was not whiskey.  This was a sickly sweet concoction from the Willy Wonka factory that almost made me dislike apples and whiskey forever."}
{"text":"As you pull up to McKoy's the smell is intoxicating. Relatively small dinning room and bar combination bit it works. Menu is quite vast and has a great selection. I got a combo platter that had just about everything they offer. I'll post a pic on my blog and more a more descriptive explanation at www.chewing thoughlife.com shortly. Its a great place and i highly recommend it"}
{"text":"I had the large pulled pork plate with fried squash and spicy pinto bean sides. Bbq was excellent and I used the vinegar based sauce. Way too much for me to eat in one sitting so I ended up with about a half a pound of q to take home. Fried squash is the best I have ever had! Delicious batter and cooked to perfection. I didn't have anything to dip it in like ranch but didn't need it. The spicy pinto beans were not that hot...I would say between a mild and medium heat. Very good though. My gf ordered a chicken wrap with the Mac n cheese side because of all the great reviews of Mac n cheese. We both thought the Mac and cheese was really good but not the best we have ever had. I would promote the fried squash and the fried tomatoes that we got as a starter. The tomatoes were cut thick and also had this amazing batter on it. We both thought they were cooked and sliced perfectly. A lot of places cut them too thin but not here. And to top it off they had $2 margaritas that we thought were great....especially for $2!"}
{"text":"This was a great place if you're looking for a sports bar type of place and wanting quality food. They had some local beers and are very known for their wings and pot roast. We tried the wings and they are not your usual fried wings. These were smoked and you could taste the quality in them. The staff was great and told us they recently were filmed for their wings and pot roast."}
{"text":"I have had two outstanding entrees here-Shrimp Grits and their Chicken Wings.  I had my wings Buffalo Hot. They are smoked first,  then grilled. They are very large, moist,  and super tasty (and NOT deep fried). Those Shrimp Grits taste great and I couldn't believe how many large shrimp were in my bowl.  
Tonight I had the smoked half chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Very good, not outstanding. 
Check this place out for yourself!"}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for a meeting and choose McKoys based on the reviews, unfortunately I wasn't as pleased as I hoped. They were very busy for it to be a Tuesday night. They appeared to be understaffed based on the wait time. Lauren our server was pleasant but seemed a bit overwhelmed handling such a large party along with her additional tables. We arrived around 6:30 bet didn't recieve our food until after 8pm. Some of the orders were satisfactory while others were clearly left under the heating light a little too long. I give a 3 because Lauren really tried to be attentive but just had too much to handle. I noticed that once the crowd died down she was more attentive to our large party but, by that time we were done and ready for the check. I believe if our food was recieved while still hot and not luke warm the rating could have been higher but unfortunately that did not happen. I would definately recommend that the servers work more as a team to help one another out especially with a large party."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte on business and found this place while looking for a place for dinner.  I had the pot roast, which came with potato salad and cole slaw.  The service was lacking - the place was empty when I got there, but they put me in a small table by the bar (I did not want to sit at the bar).  I asked for a different table, and the waitress put me in another small table at the other end of the bar.

The food was okay - portion of pot roast was not pot roast but brisket, but a humongous portion - it must have been over a pound of meat, dumped on a plate.  Fortunately, they had some barbeque sauce, which made it palatable.  I ate about 1/4 of it and left the rest.

For what it is it is good. Personally, I will not go back."}
{"text":"Had my 2nd visit to McKoy's on Saturday for lunch.  Before heading to the airport my friends wanted BBQ one more time and I figured they'd tried Mac's, let's go somewhere else.

It was a bit of a let down this time.  Our server was new, and she told us this at the end of our meal.  But really it was painfulyl obvious from the way she gave someone sweet tea instead of unsweet and forgot to differentiate between the regular Coke and the diet's.  Oh well she was sweet if not a bit out there.

We started with fried green tomatoes and the wings in the bar-balo sauce.  Both were good and I really liked the wing sauce, it had a nice tang to it but not spicy (I can't handle any spicy foods).

All 4 of us ordered ribs, 2 full racks and 2 half.  I got a half w/side salad and sweet potato fries.  The salad was really good for a side and the honey mustard dressing was yummy.  The 1/2 rack of ribs was still too much food.  The 2 who got the full looked shocked when the food arrived.  The sweet potato fries were not as good as last time, I kept raving about them to anyone who would listen, this time they were just average.  The ribs were okay, I've had much better.  And apparently the complaint from those w/full rack said half was really moist and the other half was dried out and tough.  Took a bite of mac and cheese and it was good.

I'd go back again.  The wings were solidly good on both trips and they have good drink specials.  I just would probably not go out of my way to head back soon though."}
{"text":"It's 2/28 Tuesday at 11:48... I got to go.. and I also got to go back!!!  My server was Bri... I could tell when she picked up the phone to ask me what I wanted that this was going to be good food.. AMAZING customer service.. I actually left a $2 tip for a $19 bill... for To Go!!!  Which is unheard of for me... I got side of mac n cheese, I do wish it was hotter and less greasy.. but it's still unique and really F***ing good... I also got 12 (proclame¿?) wings... the are amazing, fall off the bone, juicy, different... and the carrots & celery that comes with it, I got ranch.. the ranch is soooooooo good.. seems homemade.. a little chunky.

I will be back.. ask for Bri."}
{"text":"I needed some great wings and saw on a few lists that McCoy's were highly rated. Smoked wings aren't my favorite style, but when they're done right they are fantastic. So I knew I wasn't getting crispy fried wings.  I tried the buffalo and calypso wings. They were excellent. Perfect smoky flavor that complimented the really nice thin sauce. The meat was fall off the bone tender.  I plan on going back to try the BBQ again soon. 
My first visit I experienced dry BBQ, if my next visit is as good as the wings, I'll be bumping them to 5 stars"}
{"text":"I tried this place with my boyfriend on a whim because it was close to our hotel and because we were told we had to try the barbecue in Charlotte. This has to be hands down the best meal we had in Charlotte, with some of the best food I've ever had period.

I got the pulled chicken sandwich with Mac n cheese. I consider myself a mac n cheese master and this was some of the best I've ever had. The chicken was perfectly moist and absolutely delicious. My boyfriend got the burger and fries. The fries were perfectly seasoned and perfectly crispy (some of the best fries either of us have had in a long time) and he described the burger as \"a solid burger, and not a lot of places make a solid burger.\"

For dessert we got the brownie sundae, which was pretty good as far as brownie sundaes go :).

Definitely a must-try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Everything that was sat on the table was great!!! Best wings ever, get them double crispy!! The pnut butter pie is also the best I have ever had!! Open till 2.  You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Oh my god! The staff? The atmosphere, the people, the food! All great! Portions so big I always leave with a to go box!"}
{"text":"It's a Sports Bar!  A friend told me I did not want to go there and he did not want to go there.  I asked why.  He said \"It's a Sports Bar\"!

Last Friday my second lunch started at 2:30pm (got a burger for my first lunch somewhere on South that I will neither review nor go back) so I'm ready for something really good this time.  It was my first time eating at Mc Koy's and though the service was perfect and beyond and the food was Very good I will probably not come back here either only because it is not my scene (It's a Sports Bar).  

Even though they had quite a crowd for 2:30 in the afternoon the food came out fast and though my wait was brief I enjoyed watching some of the Foot Ball Highlights (I'm not lying I really enjoyed it).  My waitress gave great instructions on ordering and gave me plenty of time yet still checked on me enough to make sure I was doing well (BIG Secret!  * * * She was friendly yet non-intrusive - She checked on me though did not and needed not say something every time -  She was as Professional as any wait staff at any price level - She had an intuitive gift that I appreciate in a person!  Excellent!)!  

In the Kitchen (no I did not go back there) something GREAT was going on behind the scenes. As Tonya P. (P. for Poprock Photography) describes well prepared food \"Made with LOVE\"  This plate and a half was!  See Photos - This plate was piled with mmmmmmmmm Sweet Potato Fries perfectly Seasoned (and not quite typical) on the yelp scale 4.70 stars.  BBQ Sandwich (hey the bun was good but I've already had a burger 15 minutes ago so skip the bread (or half of it - told you it was good).  The Pork ...Mmmmm this is a Great Tasting (even with no sauce) Pork so I want to use a fork.  An Easy 5 yelp stars for the Pork! !  !  My waitress said both (Vinegar and Sweet Sauces) were good!  Both were VERY Good, 4.75+ stars at least!

Pasta Salad: really I only wanted a taste yet I could not stop eating it.  This is a simple almost dry Pasta Salad and probably deserves more that 4 stars.  Next Cole Slaw with much Mayonnaise (I hate Mayo and I knew that it was like this so I ordered it on the side so I could taste it, though not on my sandwich.  Even though I never eat this kind of slaw, this one is good (I took two small bites, the second was to make sure).  So why would I not want to go back?  ONLY because it's a Sports Bar (for the 53rd and last time in this review) and better stay that way because it looks to be working very well! !  !  I'm Impressed!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! I can't believe I've been in Charlotte for 17 years and just now checking this place out. The staff, everyone from management to servers and bartenders were extremely friendly despite how busy it was. We didn't feel rushed and were welcomed back when we left. Everything on the menu looked amazing and I will be back with my motorcycle on bike night."}
{"text":"Okay, I need to sit down and have a talk with all the people who rated this place so highly. Either we got here on a bad night or y'all don't know what good food is. The service is good, the ambiance is what you'd expect - rowdy and catered to the sports fans. Not a problem. The food, however, is not what it should be. 

I got a $25 ribeye. Now let me start off by telling you, I'm a  fat girl and steak connoisseur. I know what a good steak is. This was an excellent cut of steak. They just cooked it horribly. I ordered it medium rare, as any true steak eater should, but what I got ran the gamut between well and rare. Every bite was a mystery, and not in the good way. Plus, they threw on some gross herbed butter (I taste NO garlic) but ABSOLUTELY NO SEASONING WHATSOEVER. I'm sorry, but steaks MUST be salted while cooking to bring out the natural flavor. This was not. Oh, and my \"sauteed  mushrooms\"... ew. Mushrooms should not taste like some weird tomatoey onion amalgamation. I think their garlic might have been old or something. 

Also, my husband's ribs were undercooked and the sauce tasted like it was out of a jar from the local Food Lion. No beuno. I don't know what \"St. Louis\" these people have been to, but the only one I know has better seasoning than that. The ONLY good thing was the side salad. It was actually decent, which tricked us into thinking we were getting a good meal. Damn them. 10/10 would not recommend. The only reason this got two stars instead of one was because of the salad and the service. 

And it's Christmas and I'm feeling charitable."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place for a late dinner on a Wednesday night. A quick Yelp search showed McKoys a few miles from our hotel. 

Our waitress, Brittany was so friendly.  All of us ate different meals. The blackened chicken sandwich was nearly perfect. The bun was pretty dry but other than that it was delicious.  The ribeye,green beans and mashed potatoes were also very good. Mac n cheese was good as well. 

This is a solid place for good food."}
{"text":"Good bbq!  Friendly service. 

Got the sampler plate with ribs, chicken, pulled pork and pot roast. Ribs were really good. I wished I had ordered the ribs plate instead of the sampler... The chicken was good too. Pot roast and pulled pork were ok. 

For sides I got Mac & cheese and fried okra. Fried okra was great. Bottom pieces were a bit greasy but they were really crispy and yummy. I thought the Mac & cheese was just ok. Would have rather tried the collards but the Mac & cheese was recommended so I went with that. 

Pecan pie was awesome. I was really full but still finished the pecan pie. :)"}
{"text":"Came in late after flying in to Charlotte on business.  Decided to sit at the bar which was an excellent decision since we were taken care of by Bud.  

Bud was not only an amazing bartender, but an amazing server.  He kept us from being thirsty and suggested the pulled pork plate from the late night menu which was amazing.

Awesome t-shirts too by the way."}
{"text":"I love great wings.   I can honestly say this place has got the best wings hands down.   I would recommend getting them double grilled.   The smoked wings are unstoppable and a must have."}
{"text":"On the hunt for some authentic NC barbeque, we found McKoy's through Yelp. I know the vinegar based sauce is the more true to NC bbq, but I loved that they also offered the other kind.

We tried the pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches. The chicken is a must try! It's finished on the grill, which gives it a nice crispy char. I loved the coleslaw on the sandwiches. 

Great comfort food!"}
{"text":"Relaxed atmosphere, classic biker bar feels.  The food is tasty and the portions are huge, but the highlight is the staff. They are eager to serve and seem to really enjoy their job which shows in the way they treat their customers. The wings are on point with excellent char and flavor and we even got a few extra to make sure we were extra full."}
{"text":"So I got the smokes chicken wings and Mac N Cheese. They were both really good!!!  And the service there was great. The bill also wasn't that much for what I received food and drink wise, so that was awesome!  All in all, it was a really good experience, and I definitely recommend the place!"}
{"text":"Met a couple buddy's here for lunch. Wow, outstanding! One of my co-workers and I ordered th bbq plate, my other buddy - the club sandwich. I was so impressed with the flavor of everything that I commented on it. My buddies agreed. I will keep this place near the top of my list for great lunch spots. The bbq is at least as good as MAC's and the sides...better! I highly recommend for delicious food."}
{"text":"OVERRATED!
This may be ok for the locals but....

First visit restaurant can highly recommended.
Ordered a cold bottle beer, had to ask for a cold glass.
Ordered the pot roast dinner, approximately 3 pounds of luke warm greasy meat came out to my table, with hot Mac and cheese.
Good service bad food this trip."}
{"text":"I am in town for one night and I found this place on yelp.  So, I decided to try it.  Loved it.  They have the best bartenders anywhere.  Despite being pretty busy at 6:30 pm on a Monday (I hear it gets way busier later), the service was very fast and very friendly.  And if the biker bar label scares you a bit, let me tell you that the clientele are every bit as friendly as the staff.  As for the food, I ordered McKoy's Barbecue Sandwich (pulled pork and cole slaw on a roll with a side).  The pulled pork was so juicy that the roll pretty much melted in my hands!  For my side I ordered the mac and cheese, and it may be the best Mac and cheese I ever had!  They also have a lot of cool events like live music and Biker Night every Friday.  Tonight they had a cornhole tournament.  If I ever make it back to Charlotte, this place will be first on the list of places to go!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ!  We had a sample dish to split and could only eat half.  Great service too!  We will be back"}
{"text":"Food was awesome!!! Just visiting NC and this is def one of the best BBQ places I've had the pleasure of eating. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys BBQ places. Mac n cheese is fantastic, mash potatoes were very good and the pull pork sandwich was damn good."}
{"text":"This place had a Cool vibe. Very low-key. We got here in the midst of biker weekend so it was a mixed crowd. 

The mac and cheese is incredible. I should have had it as my full course.  The collard greens were very good. Especially after I added the chili vinegar to it. The chicken wings with buffalo sauce were good but I can understand why they give you the option of double grilling it. They were a few that were on the soft side but overall still very good.

The Fried Chicken which they do state will take over 20 minutes looks really good on the plate but had too much breading. I tried the LTD which has a mix of barbecue chicken, ribs, pork and roast. It was okay. There is a lot of meat which is good but not the most flavorful barbecue I've ever had. Service was slow but it's understandable given the fact that it was a busy weekend. I had a good time but wasn't overwhelmed hence three stars."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place for awhile. I think I just found my new favorite place. Everything was so delicious! Definitely order a basket of dinner rolls or cornbread and make sure you get the fried squash! The place was packed full but the owner greeted everyone going in and out. He also came by our table and brought us samples to try for our next visit. From the outside this may look like a bike bar but on the inside is a fantastic atmosphere, great service, and gourmet food!"}
{"text":"Great barbecue place and Was pleased by the lunchtime service. 
Would have to return to see what dinner clientele and bar scene was like before reviewing again with a higher rating. ."}
{"text":"Back in the days where I didn't write reviews on Yelp... I've been here, however I never came back after. Let's just start with the obvious... It's not well known and you won't know it's really there unless you really take a good look. Inside you'll find straight up a bar. Some super old timer bar. You'll probably be blasted back to the west when you see the inside. But, it literally is just a straight up bar. Seating is super old, like the booth that we initially sat on felt like it was about to break. We opted for the table instead.

So this is what we ordered: 
St. Louis Full Rack of Ribs and Living the dream.  These two things fed the 4 of us contently. We also ordered the greens as well as fried okra and green beans. To us though, the greens, even though they were cooked in pork stock, was sweet! What?! Why?! I felt that they added sugar within the greens, which completely turned our appetites off for the greens. The mushrooms and the fried okra were okay.

The St. Louis Full Rack of Ribs was a winner to us, as well as the pot roast. The pot roast was fatty, the way we like it, but we should have had more. That was the sad thing about our order, that living the dream didn't provide as much of pot roast as it did with the pulled pork and chicken. The pulled pork and chicken, well, it was dry. I've definitely have had better before, but it wasn't bad with it drenched in sauce. But, to be honest it comes out pretty dry. 

If you want to take my cents and you're unsure of what to order... I would recommend you to get the ribs or the pot roast. You won't go wrong there, at least for our taste. The service was good, and there wasn't much else to say. Stick to the chairs, ribs, and pot roast and you'll win here."}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte the hotel staff told us about this place, Irish Pub & Bar-B-Que !

We had dinner and drinks outside on the patio, the Salmon was great, their Pot Roast was so tender, smokey flavored and such a large portion we almost couldn't finish off the serving.

Our server was Great, in fact, all of their employees were cheerful & helpful, almost like they were each a part owner of the establishment.

The smoked meats were very tasty and so was the Guinness.

Just across the street from the LINX Train / Public Transportation to and from downtown.

A few beautiful Harley Davidson Motorcycles were parked just within my view.

Do yourself a favor, If you have the chance, stop in here."}
{"text":"I headed straight to McKoy's after landing at the airport because after googling \"things to eat in North Carolina\" all the searches came back saying BBQ. I placed an order for the BBQ pork plate to go with the super sweet bartender. McKoy's seems like a cool place to eat and have a drink or two, but all I really wanted was to take a shower, get in my pajamas and eat in bed! (It's allowed at hotels. At home, not so much).  Anyway, despite all the \"research\" I did, I forgot that NC bbq sauce is vinegar based and I promptly choked and coughed up a storm from the tanginess. I started dipping a little more conservatively after that. They also give you a second, more traditional bbq sauce as well. Everything was delicious, including the mac & cheese and coleslaw. I only managed about half the plate before I gave up. 

I highly recommend McKoy's and am looking forward to coming back the next time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"We were headed back to Toronto on a super long drive back from Florida and this little BBQ spot popped up on Yelp very close to the highway.

We decided to do take out and eat in the car, as all of our worldly belongings were stuffed in the trunk and backseat (the neighborhood didn't look super friendly at night if you catch my drift).

Bae and I split the large pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac n cheese and an order of fries. Bud the bartender sent us a little care package with two of their BBQ sauces, one vinegar based and the other more classic style - both were so so good but my fave was the vinegar based one.

The pulled pork itself was a huge portion, super tender and moist with no fatty bits, so delicious. The toasted bun was perfectly piled high with the yummy meat and the little bit of coleslaw added a great crunch to the sandwich.

Wish I knew they had homemade peanut butter pie before we left as I would have definitely opted for a slice for the way home ;)

Would absolutely return when in the area again!"}
{"text":"Clearly I am in the minority.   I have been there three times and each time, the service was mediocre and the food just awful.   I have friends that swear by their wings, I have tried them twice, both just below par.   Last night we visited, I wanted to really give it another go.....   My wife got a Salad + BBQ, the BBQ was dry and not very flavorful, like it had been smoked earlier in the day or the night before and quickly warmed up.   I had the Country Style Steak which is a plain ass boring, no flavor hamburger patty, lightly bread, flash fried (I think) and served with white mushroom onion gravy.  I added pork belly to it.   The gravy was watery, no flavor.  The pork belly was awful, hard to chew and no flavor.

I have no idea why we have bad luck here.   We even got some mixed drinks, the pour was awful, all mixer.  WTF?   I have been to McCoys for bike night and they always had great, stiff, make you drink more - drinks!!!!!!!!!

So, considering they cancelled bike night and the above, I have no reason to ever frequent this establishment, there are way better choices in CLT."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness !! Good- fantastic service- awesome  atmosphere- soft and friendly. I'll be back next week. That cheese corn bread hmmmm."}
{"text":"Amazing. The owner came by our group to make sure we understood the menu, seeing if we had questions, and was super nice. 

We order the sampler for an app, the wings were incredible. I ordered the \"LTD\" with Mac and cheese and fried squash as sides. 
Can. Not. Even. Completely mind blown. You must eat here."}
{"text":"Great food and at a real reasonable price. The service is a bit slow in comparison to my stomping grounds but the southern hospitality makes up for it. I have had the filet and the blacked tilapia, no complaints. The wings are out of this world !!!"}
{"text":"As for this local place, everything was pretty good but nothing was stellar.  The one exceptional dish I had was the tomato bisque.  The rest was average to good.  I would only go back the same way I went the first time, Saturday night and all the best places have huge waits."}
{"text":"Great food, beer and BBQ! Open late with a late night menu. Stopped here on a layover in Charlotte and the food and very filling portion size did not disappoint. Casual vibe with all the sports games on the TVs around us. Yumm!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a layover for some bbq and basketball. Really good stuff."}
{"text":"This is not a chain, and I am not an expert on southern BBQ. But whatever my expectations were on a southern food, this place exceeded them. We had a few extra days in Charlotte before a wedding, and found this great smokehouse and saloon not far from our hotel. It is not the fanciest of restaurants...but hey, what do want? It's a saloon. And a very clean one with super friendly service. Not used to this \"southern hospitality,\" especially coming from New York. There were 5 of us dining that evening, and we found the food to be absolutely delicious. I had the pulled pork sandwich, which was out of this world! The portion was generous, it had a terrific smokey taste, and there was not a shred of fat to be found. Would rate it the best so far. It will be hard to find another place to top it. Our waitress, Ashleigh, could not have been nicer, and patiently took our order during a very busy dinner hour. Definitely a return spot when traveling to this area again!"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip to Charlotte and wanted to find a place to get good Carolina Barbecue. I decided on McKoy's since it was also billed as a saloon and I thought I'd get a good beer selection as well.

On the night I went, the beer taps were not working for some technical reason so I ordered bottled beer. I had a local brew called Rail house or something like that. It was a very good IPA and it was served good and cold.

Since it was my first time, I ordered the LTD (Living The Dream) platter which had four meats: Chicken, pulled pork, ribs, and pot roast. I got coleslaw and fried okra on the side.

The pulled pork was just so-so. It didn't have a real smoky flavor. However, everything else was fantastic. The chicken was tender, the ribs were smoky with a good dry rub, and the smoked pot roast was very good. 

Also, I'm a big guy and this plate filled me up even though I did not finish the pulled pork. I'd read in previous reviews that the portions were big so I did not order an appetizer, although the wings looked very tempting."}
{"text":"AWESOME!  Visiting from out of town and staying near the airport and wanted some Carolina BBQ (pulled pork).  This place did not disappoint.  The pork was meaty, not fatty, and cooked perfectly.  No sauce needed, but if you opt for it do the vinegar-based.  My wife had the pulled chicken and it was just as good. The only thing missing was the hush puppies.  Nice vibe... part corner bar and part BBQ joint, great prices.  Yuengling on tap, dogs can eat on the porch, they even have a kids menu, what more do you want?"}
{"text":"Great food for a very good price. I had the ribs with Mac and cheese. I also tried the hot wings. It was really good with so much flavor. Too bad I was able to enjoy it once. It's a lot of food, I think the kids meal is sufficient for any adult. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll be sure to come back!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the bar food and the BBQ at McKoy's. been a \"go to\" place now for over 10 years. Cute staff, friendly too. Good cold beer."}
{"text":"This is a stand up biker type bar.  The service and food are EXCELLENT!  My favorite menu item is the wings.  I rarely eat wings anywhere so it's weird for me to even be commenting about them!  Friends turned me on to the way to order them.  Order them asking for them to be double grilled and \"barbalo style.\"  They are crispy and out of this world!  You cannot go wrong with anything on their menu.  You will be guaranteed to leave feeling full, happy and satisfied!"}
{"text":"Passable for late night. 
I arrived at my hotel near exit 6 off I-77 just before 10pm on a Tuesday and knew that my dining options would be limited. With a mixed-bag of review and approval from the hotel front desk employee, I decided to give McKoy's a try for take-out. I will say that my food was prepared quickly as I stopped by a gas station to fill up and by the time I returned my wings were ready.

The mac n' cheese I ordered as a side was a big thin and soupy. Unfortunately the 12 wings left something to be desired; they were not bad and I appreciated the smoky flavor, but seemed no better than what I would get at a BW3's. I did appreciate the Calypso sauce (teriyaki and bbq combined).

I can't speak to the bbq and while I did like the smell of the smoker from the parking lot, I did not get the impression of an overly authentic restaurant. I've had worse meals, but in Charlotte I have certainly had better. I would characterize this place as more of a saloon and fully appreciate that late-night can reduce options."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best spots for wings in charlotte.  Highly recommend this place! That simple."}
{"text":"Was here about a week ago and had the smoked pot roast.  Great dinner. Excellent attentive service.  Seems to be a popular locals place.

Update: 2nd visit tried the ribeye steak with side salad and loaded baked potato. Steak was typical \"institutional\"steak, cooked well though with a nice garlic butter on top. Nothing wrong with it, but, nothing special either.  Don't think it was worth 24.99.  Potato had decent quantity of toppings.  I'll be back, but, sticking to smoked and bbq."}
{"text":"Drove from union county for fried chicken and onion rings.  They have removed onion rings from the menu!!  Why?  They were amazing.  Fried chicken was cooked in old oil, and I do mean OLD.  They should utilize a filter agent or change oil more often.  Have been a patron for years, this will not encourage my continued patronage."}
{"text":"bike night was a blast but boy their food stinks now. Save your money don't eat bland pork bbq or dried tough ribs.  waitress saw great. Now the wings were GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"This is great BBQ joint. My wife and I split the mixed meat platter, the fried chicken, and had the appetizer sampler and it was great. The only thing that was the chicken nachos, and the fried chicken were pretty tasteless. The meat platter though was AMAZING!! Would definitely recommend and return for some great BBQ!"}
{"text":"Five stars.  What?  That means this is currently my top bbq place in the world.  I do not hand out 5 stars to all restaraunt. A 5 only goes to the best of each type of restaraunt.  So enjoy your meal.  I had the award wining St. Louis ribs the Mac and cheese and the cole slaw.   Also the wings.  The wings and the Mac and cheese are the best I ever are and the ribs are up there possibly the top three so just go there is no question this is the real deal!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Eat here at least once a month, good stuff. Wait staff is quick and mixed drinks are strong. Buffalo chicken sandwich is yummy"}
{"text":"Good service.  Great rich food. What else should I ask for. I ordered pulled smoke pork was great. It cone with two sides I got green beans and saute mushrooms, the sides where done gray from fresh veggies. Will go again."}
{"text":"Place was great.  Treated this out of town-er like I was a regular.  Staff was awesome especially the two bartenders (male and female).  Food and pricing were pretty good as well."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for great food. I liked the BBQ, but didn't really like the pot roast (too soupy). The mac and cheese is crazy good- highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty good prime rib!

Drink prices are average for the city, which means 7 bucks a cocktail.

Nachos are good with a bbq mixed in with the quest.

The also have some good specials on fridays where u get a steak and pint for a deal."}
{"text":"This place is hidden behind a gas station, and it's worth finding. Delicious barbecue and plenty of variety if you would like something else. 

The chicken and pulled pork are great, potato salad is creamy and tangy, the baked potato is packed with lots of meat (your choice). Great service, cozy but comfy."}
{"text":"Came here looking for some good NC, bbq! I've never had BBQ from the south while being in the south so I was excited! This place had lots of good reviews so I decided to stop in, I was seated quickly and that's when the service went downhill. Out of approximately 7 waitresses that were walking around none came over to take my order, I waited about 20 minutes before just asking a random waitress passing by if I could order. She put in my order the food came but that was the end of the service. No one ever came over to ask if I'd like a drink refill, or to see if the food was ok. All in all it was ok but nothing worth instagraming about."}
{"text":"We came her before a Hornets game and the service and food were great.  The best wings in town !!"}
{"text":"Busy on a Friday night tells you people like the place!  There's a nice outdoor patio. Waited just 10 minutes for our table. Server Caroline was very nice and attentive. Bar-balo wings came out fast and were great. The pork plate was great - a good portion of tender pulled BBQ. Sauces on the table were a vinegar based, a sweet and spicy, and of course Texas Pete. The Mac & Cheese was great - a big scoop with lots of baked on cheese. Fried Squash were thin and crispy - perfect. Friends had a BBQ sandwich - big and a buffalo chicken wrap that she enjoyed (I thought it looked a little small). The band started rockin at about 9:00. A fun night. I'll go back!"}
{"text":"I don't necessarily consider myself a BBQ snob, but I do have BBQ standards!  First let's start with the biggest qualifier... I'm a North Carolinian so BBQ=pork...beautiful smokey tender chopped piggies!  I do also enjoy other good BBQ like ribs and beef but my go to will always be pork and it will have that NC tangy vinegar sauce.  Well McKoys most definitely met qualifier number one they offer all sorts of BBQ even smoked wings, (get to those shortly).  #2, whilst walking up to your door I better get a smokey kick in the face indicating you most likely have a smoker on premises and slow cook the meat until tender and amazing..CHECK! I was met by the aroma of roasting meats before even getting out of the car.  Also menu says they use pecan wood Havant seen that much... seems to do the job well.  3rd, not a disqualifier but good sauce is highly recommended, not always necessary though if meats are prepared well enough you don't always need it.  But I do usually get a little disappointed if sauce sucks, especially if they don't have a good tangy sauce!  Be warned if the sauce sitting on your tables is bought at a grocery store you're not a real BBQ joint.  McKoys falls a little short here as they only have 2 sauces --one pretty close to ketchup, and one straight apple vinegar, after combining the two with a little kick of hot sauce it was pretty formidable so can't ding them to much on this.  A good beer selection is also always good and McKoys has a decent selection, I think I saw 7-8 taps even a few local options which is always good for bonus points from me.  
  To our food, first we got the sampler app...nachos, skins, wings, tenders... had a lot of people so I only got a skin a tender and a wing... tenders were premade frozen tenders deep fried, good, nothing special.  Skins were very good! But the appetizer super star was the Wings!  OMG.... SO GOOD!  Very smokey flavor most tender wings I have ever had and sauce had a good flavor but did not overpower the wing and take away from the smokey meaty flavor.  Wife informed me nachos were pretty darn good as well.  
For dinner I ordered pulled pork plate...surprise! Pork was well done...well seasoned cooked low and slow, succulent, juicy, tender smokey....GREAT BBQ.  Good mixture of the \"bark\" mixed in(crispy charred exterior). Could taste it was well seasoned/prepared.  
For my sides Mac and cheese and collards.  I had heard about this place just for the Mac and cheese but even the tales of Cracaroni and cheese didn't do justice to this melty cheesy concoction.  It really was best I've had in a LONG TIME.  Collards were also awesome some of the best I've had.  Wife got fried squash as a side and that was impressively good!  Lightly breaded and deep fried, dip it in ranch and you're knock in on heavens door.

Service was good too place was packed--saturday night--but good team work by the employees checking each others tables, delivering food wherever, no customer seemed unattended for long.

Cannot wait to go back...a BBQ joint that can hang with any Charlotte has to offer.  Great food, large portions, prices about average maybe a little higher but reasonable regardless!  Overall great place, thanks for the great meal McKoy's!"}
{"text":"First off, if you have 3-5 hours to spend dining, this IS the place for you!  If you don't, move on...

I rarely give out one star's but this place had to get one.  I read the reviews on here and since we were passing by that area, I thought this would be a good stop to catch a bite to eat.  Unfortunately, I made a mistake in judgment.

First, the place isn't in the best section of town.  In fact, I was approached by some locals asking for extra money in their parking lot.  When driving away from this establishment, it was clear it was not in a safe section of town.

Second, we waited to be seated, and then waited over 10 minutes to be recognized by the staff.  They were not over busy, open tables everywhere.  The wait staff was ample, but maybe they just were new or untrained?  

When outside in the front when entering and exiting, folks were smoking directly in front of the entrance/exit.  Not the best place for a smoking section.

overall, this place can do much better with service and customers.  Location can't change, but that doesn't mean it has to take on that location with the service."}
{"text":"Combination of a smokehouse, saloon & sports bar.  Great atmosphere!  Was just passing through and planned to have my old standby, pulled pork but opted for the pot roast based on a a Yelp review and it was outstanding.  Sides were mac & cheese and the spicy pinto beans,  both were great."}
{"text":"This was the first bar my husband and I visited when we first moved to Charlotte.  They were right across the street from our hotel, and it just called to us.  My husband and I both have motorcycles, so it was GREAT to learn this was a biker friendly bar, let ALONE a biker bar w/ an awesome Bike Night.  They food doesn't suck either.  We usually get burgers ('cause they're everything a burger should be) but we're very fond of the \"Smokin' BBQ Pork Platter\".  We can order a Large, and it feeds the both of us with some left over... for only $12! 
They almost ALWAYS have an awesome band playing on Friday during Bike Night, and the set up in the lot is just AWESOME. I love me some Macs Speed Shop, but they can't touch McKoy's food and atmosphere. We love this place and will continue eating/playing here for as long as we're in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Nice servers. We ordered the grilled chicken salad. Chicken was a tad bit overdone but the quesadillas were huge! No complaints. Next time I'll try the BBQ"}
{"text":"Mac and Cheese is incredible. 
Sweet potato fries are very good.
Pulled pork is tasty.
Yummy sweet tea.
Huge servings.
Only was in town for 1 night, wanted to get some Carolina pulled pork as I usually don't make it to this part of the country. This place was open early and I needed to be somewhere by noon. So an early lunch (10AM) on a Saturday was my only chance. I was not disappointed. Need to get to Charlotte again someday."}
{"text":"First time - will definitely go back - 3 of us - pulled pork platter was fantastic - wife had the ribs they were better than expected - buddy had the pot roast it was excellent and a great add to the menu - food was far better than expected and some good BBQ comparing it to most in town it was above board - service was fantastic - unexpectedly surprised about the whole visit!!!! -"}
{"text":"Enjoyable BBQ!

Pros:
Staff was nice. Environment felt like a nice, well kept pub. The drinks were always full, and the food was hot. The BBQ was really good and their BBQ sauce is on point. 

Cons:
I couldn't think of any!"}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ in this old town saloon. And the dishes are HUGE! It's a pretty loud joint, do make sure to order their nachos with pulled pork, it's awesome.
The ribs are pretty good too.
Lots of beer on tap as well."}
{"text":"Our group of eight was hungry for BBQ, so we headed to McKoy's for lunch.  Five of the group had BBQ and three of us had something not barbecued.  Two had sandwiches, buffalo chicken and a club.  I had the shrimp and grits which was excellent.  I also had a side of Mac n cheese which was great.  I ended my meal with a piece of peanut butter pie - delicious.  Service was great."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ place in town.  Delicious pulled pork BBQ sandwich.  They make all their BBQ sauces and dressings from scratch.  It is a biker bar and it can often be difficult to find parking.  I also enjoy the grilled Buffalo shrimp.  The Mac and cheese is creamy and delicious.  It is a bit of a dive but plenty of tvs to watch games and a small bar.  Lots of patio seating available."}
{"text":"Horrible Experience Mr. Manager 

Party of three (my family) and we ordered the following:
Wife - Ribs half rack with greens and mac n'cheese
Son - Cheeseburger plain with fries 
Me - 12 Double smoked wings (calypso & chili) and side of pasta salad. 

ISSUES:
Wife's ribs were overcooked and tough as nails. The greens filled with stems versus the preferred \"leafy\" portion. The mac n'cheese was edible. 

Son's burger was satisfying to him but not much expectations for a 12yr. old. 

My wings were beyond charred. I understand double grilled because I'm a self proclaimed expert backyard/outdoor kitchen griller myself. But I told the waitress explicitly that as long as the wings aren't burned whereas I can taste the char then I'm ok with the double grilling. She said no problem but then brought out a problem with burned wings. 

Not to mention I couldn't order all flats. I understand they're pre-packaged from the supplier and to order one specific portion over the other would throw off the overall count. All you have to do for people like myself who want specific flats or drummies is to charge us a little extra for that convenience. You never want the customer to feel their request is something far beyond your capabilities when it actually is a basic one. 

Every other restaurant will allow you to pick your pieces but will simply charge you a buck or two more for the request.   My pasta salad never made it to the table BUT it made it to the actual bill?  Go figure. I told the waitress and she of course took it off but how can it not make it to the table but find its way to the bill?

This was a total waste of $50 I have to be honest. Please feel free to contact me if you want to make it right. The last complaint I've made to a restaurant (and I travel a lot for work) was in 2009 because I'm not the complaining type. This was an exception due to it being such a poorly prepared meal with a forgotten side item that was attempted to be charged."}
{"text":"Acceptable would come to mind. I wouldn't go out of my way to go back nor recommend this place.

Regarding the food more like a bar that has BBQ and it isn't that good. If you want real BBQ there better places in charlotte."}
{"text":"Since my last review, we have moved to Charlotte and been back over & over. This place is pretty consistently awesome and I have yet to find another BBQ joint that can compete on as many fronts as McKoy's. BBQ preferences vary person to person, but this is my overall favorite."}
{"text":"Yeah yeah, I don't eat meat, but I'm reviewing this place anyway! 

Got the \"Veggie platter\" which was just your choice of 3 sides, hah. Mac n cheese was AWESOME. Sauteed mushrooms.. DE-FREAKING-LICIOUS. Everyone loved their barbecued meats with split decisions on the sauces. I liked both the tomato and vinegar based ones, really couldn't choose. 

Only thing, spicy pinto bean side is actually more a bean soup with a lot of bacon in it, so couldn't eat that. 

Fun decor, lots of tvs to watch the game, and great service. Our waitress was friendly, efficient, and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Decent barbecue. It's not the best I've ever had, but it's not the worst. You won't be disappointed, as long as you don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to go here for years and finally got the opportunity after a pub crawl recently.  The restaurant is very easy to find and has a large parking lot.  I think you could probably even take the light rail here since it is near the tracks.

The decor is very sports-bar meets pub feeling.  There is a large bar and a big open seating area.  I had the pulled pork and it was so much food I had to take some home!  The pulled pork was probably the best I have had - right up there with Midwood Smokehouse.  Very tender and flavorful.  Didn't need sauce it was so wonderful.    The service was excellent - can't wait to go back!  Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I've lived in the North Carolina for a couple of years now.  Best BBQ in the state.  The service is great.  The beer is always cold.  I highly recommend stopping by for their fried okra, smoked chicken wings or chopped pork."}
{"text":"This was a convenience stop while staying overnight and a short walk from the hotel. The staff was super friendly and our waitress, Maddie, was absolutely charming offering just the right amount of attention at just the right time. The food was above average BBQ with enormous serving sizes. The pork was moist and cooked perfectly with a delicious smoke flavor and the ribs had a expertly crafted char with no hint or any burnt taste. If I had one small criticism it would be that the fried green tomatoes were a little too greasy but that didn't prevent us from enjoying them all the same. I'd recommend this to anyone and will be stopping here when in town again."}
{"text":"Best BBQ this side of the Mississippi.  Don't be fooled by the diverse menu and the average decor outside and inside.  This place delivers; the bbq sauces are homemade and the vinegar based on is to die for."}
{"text":"A healthy portion of food (as much as I cared to eat) and a nice beer for $15 including tax.  Nice.   Had the \"small\" pork plate (pulled pork) collard greens and mac n cheese.  All good, although my personal preference is for more smoke on the pork.  Carolina style vinegar sauce was good. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"I have lunch here about once a week (no judging... it's a good place.. not good for my waistline). The anything BBQ is good: pulled pork, ribs, chicken... all good. I mostly get the lunch specials which are a huge value for the money.

Yesterday someone at my table ordered the Buffalo shrimp and they were awesome, I think I might start ordering those all the time.

The service is great, friendly staff... no complaints here."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting family and we were in need of a late night place to eat. Mckoy's wasn't far and had a decent Yelp rating.

I will start with the good. The customer service was great. Lindsay was our server and did an excellent job at explaining the menu and popular items. Overall we really enjoyed the macaroni & cheese-it was amazing! Also we enjoyed the side salad. Some of us had chicken and it was okay.

Here is the bad. All of our sides (sautéed green beans/mushrooms and collard greens) were very bland. It was very disappointing. Also I ordered the pulled chicken and it came out looking like chopped chicken. Again this southern girl was disappointed.

I definitely was expecting something different. Will we return or recommend this restaurant? Unfortunately no. The food didn't taste up to par with the descriptions and price."}
{"text":"FOOD - 5 stars:
* Stupid good PULLED PORK BARBECUE. The portions size was \"OMG, how am I going to eat all this?\" huge! You get your money's worth.....

* Fantastic TEMPURA BATTERED ONION RINGS - don't miss these. These are far and away the best onion rings that I have ever eaten. These onion rings, by themselves, are worth the trip here.

* BARBECUED WINGS that will put a smile on your face.

* Superb MAC 'N CHEESE and COLLARD GREENS. Pepper vinegar is available for the greens. Add this and some salt to the collards and thank me later.

SERVICE - 5 stars:
* My waitress was first rate, highly attentive, helpful, and friendly. She got a BIG tip!  

* VERY easy to find: Easy access from 1-77, Exit 6A.
* Plentiful parking.
* Gorgeous bartenders. Strong drinks. Bartenders also provide fast drink service. 
* Extremely laid back atmosphere, with plenty of TV tuned to sports.

* I don't much think that this is a good place for children, after all, it's still a bar. Parents, use a little common sense.

* PS: The booth's seat cushions needed some TLC, but in the grand scheme of things, that's not very important to me. The food was so delicious, that such trivial things didn't matter. This is a great sports bar/restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent wings. Great service. 100% smoked wings. Great flavor. Big meaty. I will definitely be back. 

Okra is great too."}
{"text":"Ok the reviews were right on!!! Sat outside too many guys around inside for a gal alone. The pulled pork sandwich, slaw and OMG Mac n cheese all topped with the McCoys lemonade dang I'm a happy camper. I'll totally be back!!! Trying out the coconut pie for dessert (to go) to full to eat it now ;)"}
{"text":"We don't say this often-but this place is AMAZING! Hubby ordered the LTD which comes with ribs, chicken, pulled pork & pit roast with fried okra & Mac n cheese. The pulled pork was the star performer and hubby ate every delicious morsel. I had the ribs with fries & collard greens. Everything was great, service was great & we were impressed by the teamwork displayed by the waitresses. We had more than just our server check on us, get refills, etc. We will definitely be back to McKoy's."}
{"text":"I was looking for a restaurant with good southern cooking since a family member was visiting. I read the reviews and the menu and I made the right choice! We were all stuffed and happy afterwards. It's pretty much a bar atmosphere, with TVs all around.
We ordered the fried green tomatoes as an app and they were yummy. I ordered a BBQ sandwich with Mac and cheese as my side and it was fantastic. My boyfriend ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich with fried okra and it was great as well. Overall great southern food and great/fast service!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! Fried squash, mac and cheese, BBQ chicken, BBQ ribs and pulled pork was amazing!!! Highly recommend to anyone in this area. Definitely a restaurant worth visiting!!! Service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We were in Charlotte for one night and were looking for a local place, close to the hotel. We were not disappointed. My husband and I split the Livin the Dream platter and had fried green tomatoes as an app. The food was delicious, the service was great, the staff and other patrons were all super friendly. They even had some local brews on tap. If you like meat, you can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"The Best BBQ I've had here in Charlotte N.C pulled pork sandwich & Mac n cheese, yummy!!!!!!   Great prices & great food.  Y'all hit a home run with me!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing indeed. We ordered 3 different meats to go after a wonderful day in Asheville. Reviews looked great, Mrs. G had a hankering for BBQ and loves the Carolina style. She had meatloaf, our friend had St. Louis ribs and I had pulled pork. The portions were big - but overall flavorless and more than 1/2 of each plate ended in the trash. Disappointing:("}
{"text":"Flew into Charlotte on a late Tuesday night and needed a good meal to wash away the airport food from earlier DFW...

This spot was reco'd by the hotel attendant and did not disappoint... Great wings with good spice, ask for the extra spicey sauce they got off the menu...draft beer selection is fairly typical, nothing exciting. Good service for late night (we came around midnight) 

Always dig on a biker bar with good wings."}
{"text":"Very cool BBQ restaurant near the airport.  It is an interesting mix of people - look at the vehicles in front in my pics.  The food is very cheap compared to other places I have been, but the quality was just as good. 
Pulled pork platter ($13.99) a huge pile of juicy pork.  Had good mix of meat and some bark.  I used a little of  thicker BBQ sauce which was very good.  The $2 upcharge for large is well worth it
Meal came with 2 large sides!
Mac and cheese was great.  Creamy with a lot of crispy, melty cheese on top!
Collard greens were good.  Perfectly cooked and I liked the seasoning they used.
I got a bun for $1 and now have a large lunch for tomorrow.  
The owner was around and seemed to know a lot of people.  Very friendly guy.  My waitress, Sunny, was very attentive and bubbly.  She has an appropriate name."}
{"text":"Wings were great. Ribs are dry AF tho. Dont waste your money. I recommend bringing back up sauce otherwise you might choke."}
{"text":"TL;DR get the chicken wings!!!! pot roast, fried squash, and mac & cheese are p awesome too

Had a long layover in Charlotte and decided to checkout this place! We ordered a chicken wing app (6 pc w/ Thai chili sauce) as well as the LTD, southern fried chicken, and a Caesar salad. This was WAYYY too much food for 3 people lol...just the LTD alone could've filled up our whole party plus some. 

Let me just say that the chicken wings are out of this world! Incredibly juicy and charred, and the Thai chili sauce that our waitress recommended added a real nice kick to it. If I ever came back here I would defs order this chicken wing appetizer as my meal!! 

We had a hard time deciding which meats to try, so we ordered the LTD to sample a bit of everything. The pot roast ended up being the real star of this dish (the meat just melts in your mouth!), with the other meats being a bit on the drier side. Also had sides of fried squash and spicy pinto beans with this meal -- the beans were really nothing special but the fried squash was super addicting and super crispy! 

My sister was dying to try the fried chicken so of course we had to order that as well loll. The breading is really well seasoned but besides that this dish didn't really stand out. She also ordered a side of mac & cheese which was perfectlyyy gooey/creamy/cheesey and probably the highlight of this meal for me haha. The sauteed green beans (which tbh tasted more like they were steamed :/) were just okk. 

Overall I would say this place is a 3.5/5 for food, but I bumped my rating up to 4 because of the great service and great value (HUUGE dishes for decent prices)."}
{"text":"Came here with my parents after a storm cancelled their flight back home and they had to stay another night. The place definitely has the feel of a saloon and a very relaxed atmosphere.

We started with the smoked wings and they were the way to go. They were meaty and had a great flavor. 

I had the pulled pork for dinner. It was moist and tender with a really nice pork flavor. It didn't need any BBQ sauce. Definitely give this place a try if you're nearby."}
{"text":"I stopped in here last night for happy hour with some work friends, the food was really good. We had their case Odette which was outstanding. The place is kind of small but a fun atmosphere great music great waitresses great drinks.  I did and up having a barbecue sandwich at the end the pulled pork was really good smoke correctly and they make their own barbecue sauce is well they make both the tomato-based and the vinegar-based."}
{"text":"If you want BBQ this is THE place to visit in Charlotte! My wife & I had the pulled pork platter with potato salad & Mac & Cheese as sides. The waitress asked if we wanted a large or small portion sizes. We opted for the small portion and it was the right size for us. Everything was fantastic. The Mac & Cheese was loaded with real cheese, not the processed \"Kraft\" kind of cheese. The potato salad was fresh & homemade - you could be the texture. They offer two sauces - a sweet tomato based and a \"vinegary\" flavor. Here's a tip - try combining the two! It's a five star restaurant with a four star ambiance."}
{"text":"This review is based on the only item we've eaten here SO FAR...the smoked wings.  They are the best wings...big and tasty!  Try them with the Calypso sauce (which is a mix of BBQ and teriyaki sauce) and order them \"double grilled\".  Their wings are smoked and grilled (not fried) so you get a ton of flavor out of these meaty bad boys!!  We've been here three times but we can't get past ordering a pile of these wings.  The atmosphere is low-key and fun.  I really wanted to try the homemade coconut pie but they were sold out on the last visit...reason to go back!!  And...they carry Gentleman Jack : )"}
{"text":"Popped in here for a dinner with friends and having only been here for lunch I had yet to try the BBQ.  I ended up splitting the big boy plate (I forget the actual name) with my girlfriend.  All the BBQ on the plate was delicious although I thought the chicken BBQ was a bit too dry.  That's a hard one to keep from drying out though.  The pulled pork was good and moist.

The interior is a little dated but I'm doubtful any of the patrons of this place really care.  It's got a pretty cool neighborhood feel.  The service was great and friendly.

Bottom line is, there are so many great choices for BBQ in Charlotte, this place is easy to overlook.  It just didn't stand out to me."}
{"text":"Love their food! Cheap drinks and specials. Ask for Abbie, she's the best! Buffalo shrimp and that BBQ platter is a must try! Food is way better than Macs. Love that they have a jukebox too. Two thumbs up! Coconut pie is delicious an served warm and also lemonade pie. Yum!"}
{"text":"My first trip to McKoys and the service and food were exceptional. I had a great shrimp and grits that was very flavorful. My wife had a meatloaf special that she enjoyed and would order again. We will be back when we are in the Charlotte area. The also have a nice beer selection.  Our waitress was on top of things and very pleasant."}
{"text":"Stopped in on my way through town. The place was amazing. Started with the smoke wings, had a half rack of ribs and finished with dessert.

The wings might have been the best I ever had. I wish more places did smoked wings instead of frying them.

I'm just a yankee and I'm not sure what good ribs are suppose to taste like, but damn they were delicious. Side of Mac and Cheese and Mashed Potatoes were great as well.

Had the Brownie Sunday to finish off the meal.

Sit at the bar, Alyssa is the best."}
{"text":"Stopped in one day for lunch. I had a pork platter, mac n cheese, and sauteed green beans. I was thoroughly impressed and it baffles me that more BBQ places don't use pecan wood. The mac n cheese and the green beans were almost as good as the barbecue. The only reason it's not a 5-star review was because of the sauce. There is a tomato-based sauce and what tasted like vinegar. They were ok but I would have liked more variety. That being said, I will definitely be back, possibly with a small bottle of South Carolina mustard-based sauce."}
{"text":"The pork really is fall off the bone good. Very juicy and tender. Great staff, very attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Great place for comfort food! Went on La Monday night before 6 and the place was busy but not super crowded. Got seated right away and decided to split an order of pulled pork nachos and I had the blacked chicken sandwich with fries (forgot to get mac n cheese). 

The food came quick and was super good!  The chicken sandwich was very good! The fries I got with the sandwich were a little cold, but still not too bad. 

But the pork nachos were out of this world I think! Not like regular nachos where everything is piled onto a bunch of chips but rather they made individual chips with the pork and cheese on top. Then you can add the sour cream, tomatoes and lettuce to each one!

I highly recommend here when a visit to the Queen City is in order!

I also want to give credit to my server, I gave her too much money and she returned the extra amount letting me know that I probably didn't mean to do that! I ended up giving her more of a tip!"}
{"text":"Yooooo, came in town for a few hours to North Carolina... I says!!! Gotta try BBQ if anything. Herd nothing but great things from Mckoy the Don. A couple friends pointed me in their direction. 

Dude, I walk in it's Sunday every game on with great TV's I mean Led crisp screens about 50inches all over but still low enough to have a convo over a triple Sea I believe it was called (IPA) brewskiii.

Corrrrrrsssseee I like it all the BT hands me the menu. I seen something called the \"LTD\" guy!!!!
It gots Ribs A+ Roast AFN+ Pulled Pork A also a Quarter Bird tomato based that was just a little to dry for me. Accompanied with fixins 2 of them for 19.99 deal. 

Thanks guys definitely be back for another sundy"}
{"text":"I could get used to this. After a slightly hellish 6 am flight and no food in my belly, McKoy's Smokehouse appeared on my Yelp search while a choir of angels sang in the background (in my brain, at least). I made the short stroll from my airport hotel and was greeted by the friendliest host who called me \"darlin\" and \"sugar.\" I'm not sure how I'd react to someone calling me sugar in Colorado, but here I found it endearingly Southern. 

I ordered the BBQ pork platter off of the \"vittles\" menu, which comes with two \"fixins\"--I ordered the collard greens and fried okra. I was pretty hungry and went HAM on that pork (get it?), but in all honestly this plate could probably feed a small family. I love North Carolina style BBQ and the super vinegary sauces that come with it, and theirs certainly did not disappoint. The okra was really crispy and collards were perfectly seasoned and not too soggy. For $12, this meal a total steal.

This spot was pretty quiet and tame on a Friday afternoon, but I imagine it gets rowdier during the evening (it is a biker bar, after all). My server, the host, and one of the cooks all came out during my meal to make sure everything was okay--talk about service. McKoy's, thanks for filling me up with pork and assuring me that everything's going to be okay after air travel. I love you."}
{"text":"We had a one-night stop in Charlotte and our hotel recommended McKoy's - and boy, was it a good recommendation. My business partner had the ribs and I had the pulled pork - great smoking technique and excellent sides - mac and cheese, fried okra and greens...with a lovely Tito's and lemonade on the side ;) I live in Arizona now so seek southern-style food and barbecue any time I am back east - this place was terrific and if I lived here, I would be a regular. PS GREAT service with a smile and friendliness.... that is all  (Roll Tide! ;)"}
{"text":"Food - 5
Service - 4
Value - 4

I stopped by here before leaving town to go back home to Texas so that I could sample some of the famous Carolina BBQ.  I ordered the award winning St. Louis ribs and some mashed potatoes and the green beans.  I thought it was a little pricey for just a half rack of ribs, but I really liked the bark and the pork was tender, but a almost a little too pink for me.  The mashed potatoes were great -- I wasn't sure if they put cheese in it or if it was the potato skins in there but whatever it was, it was good.  Service was a little slow even though there were only a few tables occupied so I can only imagine what it must be like when it gets crowded here.  Overall, I still prefer a good old Texas BBQ with some brisket."}
{"text":"I got the bbq pork platter with Mac n Cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy.  Everything was delicious!!!"}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte area I was in a rush but wanted to try a smokehouse. I read the reviews which seemed to be good however my experience wasn't so great. The wait staff was friendly but slow. It was lunch time and they were a little busy however after the long wait my food came out cold. The smoked pork was good but not the best I ever had. At least the beer was cold."}
{"text":"I like the food. Many TVs and it closes at 2am. Some of the food are good and some are tasteless. The first time I went there this waitress was really nice. Tonight I went there I experienced a racist waitress which was not nice."}
{"text":"I have been twice and will never return. The first time, the server acted like she was too good for her job. Swishing her hair and huffing. When I told her the tea tasted off, she rudely informed me they make it there. The fried squash was slapped on the plate in a pile of grease and tasted like mush. Every restaurant has bad days, so last week I tried again. Sassy server was not there, and our server was good. But the fried green tomatoes were over cooked, tasted like old grease, floating in the old grease along with the burned bacon crumbles. The manager removed from the table and confirmed they were overcooked. When the rest of the food arrived, my salad was wilted pale lettuce. The fried squash was even more soggy and greasy with the same old grease taste. The pulled chicken was pretty tasty though. My friend ordered the chicken nachos, and the chicken was old, pale and cold.  About how I felt at this point and I was ready to leave. Why not use that yummy pulled chicken on the nachos? When we left, our server was on break enjoying her meal, so it took some extra time with a new server to get a drink to go.  Place needs a little help."}
{"text":"That was delicious! Times two!! 
We visited once and I did not submit a big enough review so let me update this one. 

Garlic parmesan rub on smoked wings- new favorite wing place!! So much so, we came back for the 20 piece garlic Parmesan wings. 
The Second time, garlic Parmesan wing are just as juicy and grilled to yumminess!!!! We brought the kids and they even ate the pulled pork and DEVOURED the Mac and cheese!  I grab the green bean with out butter and side salad both done well and a good portion of each. 
Wait staff was friendly and helped us have a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"The food is alright but the service is trash. Our waitress was slow taking our orders. We sat there for an hour without refills. The food did not come out until almost an hour and a half after she took our orders. Even when the food came out, I was disappointed with my mac & cheese, it was so bland. The only thing they did right was cook my steak perfectly medium rare. Would not be returning. The food isn't worth the terrible service."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had the very terrible experience of staying at the Super 8 Airport Motel. When it was 11 pm, we desperately searched the area for somewhere nearby where could get food. Luckily, McKoy's was there for us. Thank you for staying open late. For an $18 cab ride (screw that, by the way), we hopped over there and enjoyed a hell of a feast.

First of all, the service was excellent. Our server was very polite and knew the menu well. She greeted us promptly and didn't mind giving her opinion on the meals.

The food is the bomb. If you order a vittle (entree), you'll get two fixin's (appetizers) included. My girlfriend got the pit smoked pot roast with mac 'n cheese and collard greens. I got the country style steak with spicy pinto beans and collard greens. We were definitely not disappointed. I thought my steak was a bit small, but her pot roast was the bomb.

Also, the place has live music and Lagunitas on tap."}
{"text":"First time trying McKoy's, I got a bbq pork plate to go.. with mashed pots & gravy & pasta salad. Generous portion of bbq with just the right amount of smoke flavor it was really good!!

Potatoes I think are real (not instant) & pasta salad both were excellent! Plus PB pie for dessert was light & fluffy & awesome too!!  (normally not a PB pie fan! but I am with theirs!)  

Overall, everything in one word was EXCELLENT!!!  I work around the corner & will definitely be going back! Can't wait!! Yum! :)"}
{"text":"I wasn't blown away by the pulled pork, probably because it was cold when it came out. The fried okra was piping hot, though. On the plus side, the vinegar sauce was tasty and Bud the bartender was super nice."}
{"text":"We had the LTD (living the dream) to share between two people and it was delicious. You just HAVE to try the coleslaw and the mac n cheese. The staff we're super friendly and knowledgeable too."}
{"text":"Walking distance from the Four Points Sheridan, which was a major selling point.  

Service was just OK.  The young lady tried, but it's really more of a sports bar that serves food than a BBQ restaurant.  The fella that brought out my meal really botched it by refusing to bring out a bit of ranch for my fried zucchini and just insisting over and over that it's not normally served that way.  Don't really care what normally happens; I want dipping sauce for my fried food.  The waitress intervened, practically pulling him away from the table, and bringing me a $0.50 cup of ranch.  She didn't mention that there would be an extra charge, although I figured there would be based on the dude's reaction, but fifty cents does seems a bit high for some dressing.  I was honestly happy to pay for him to go away!  Since it turned out my choice was the special for the night anyway, at a dollar off, it wasn't any kind of big deal--although I wish the specials has been more apparent than a sign on the floor by the door that you can never see again from inside the location...  I would have looked had I known!

The BBQ pork was OK.  I wish I had asked for half-pork, half-chicken, but I had figured the chicken would have been dry.  Based on how dry the pork was, it probably wouldn't have mattered.  I put on additional BBQ sauce from the squeeze container on the table, but it was a vinegar based sauce.  I had to ask for a non-vinegar based sauce and the gal just grabbed a bottle from the next table over.  Neither bottle was labeled and I'm glad I didn't accidentally find any hot sauce!

Really, the saving grace was the sides.  The mac and cheese was absolutely adequately cheesy.  The fried zucchini was totally worth skipping the sweet potato fries for.  I wish there had been an option to add a third or even fourth side to the plate--there's a sides-only option with 3 or 4 sides, but nothing with a meal.  Why is that???  In truth, I couldn't decide what I wanted my last bite to be--end on the super oily fried deliciousness of the thinly sliced summer squash in soft, soft breading?  Or save some of that chewy crusty cheese and creamy gooey elbow mac for the final chomp?  In reality, I stuffed both in my mouth simultaneously and that was indeed the perfect way to end the meal."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. My husband won't get anything besides the pot roast, but I've been experimenting and love everything! The only ding is slower service. But it's more of a casual pub than an upscale restaurant. 

The bartender is great, made me a custom drink not in the menu. (I wanted a fruity rum drink). We've been several times, and will keep going!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte! I love the staff and the food is amazing, especially the wings."}
{"text":"Overall I was pleased with McKoys. The food was pretty good, especially for how many BBQ places there are around here, definitely up there competing with some of the better ones around. 

The only downside was the service. Either our waitress was brand new or just isn't cut out for the service industry. She pretty much messed up every order we had. Our drinks took about 15-20 minutes to get to the table and when they finally did, the beer was warm. When asking N about specials for the night, she forgot both times we asked and had to go back and ask someone. So needless to say we were there much lobbed than anticipated but it was worth it since the food was good. Hopefully she's just getting into the swing of things and it will become more natural as time goes on. 

The food was a little pricey but portions were big so it balances out. I'll definitely go back soon to try some more menu items and enjoy the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Great experience. The staff are the epitome of Southern hospitality. 

Visited on a business trip. Sat at bar and was lucky to be served by Abby. Not often that someone is able to make you feel totally at home in a new place and she did that.

I had the St Louis ribs with mac and cheese and fried squash. The mac and cheese tasted like it was homemade...unfussy and delicious. The ribs were perfectly smoked. Not overly smokey or cooked so long that it was dry. The sauces were lovely as well.

All round great experience and I will be back!"}
{"text":"From a Northerner, Great Value, Large Portions and Great Tasting
Excellent Pulled Pork, I ordered a Large Sandwich, with Mac n Cheese more than enough for anyone with a large appetite!
If you like Sweets, I am a BIG Fan. Order the Coconut Pie, Very Sweet topped with Carmel, So good, I want another slice!

All I need now is a reason to come back to Charlotte on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"I like this place mainly for the cold beer and the bikes.  I did have some good fried okra and collard greens here though."}
{"text":"You have to get the LTD!!!  Living the Dream.  Amazing Ribs, and Awesome BBQ chicken, pulled pork and Pot Roast!!!  Better then Mac's or Jim 'n Nicks, both which I like but McKoy's wins my vote for best BBQ in Charlotte!!"}
{"text":"Had the LTD. What's funny is the fried squash chips were EXCELLENT. The BBQ items were good. Decent meal deal for $24."}
{"text":"I was in town for a business trip, and some hotel staff recommended this restaurant as a good place to get some true Carolina barbecue.  So glad he did!  This meal was delicious, and was at a very reasonable price.  
I was told the Mac n cheese was so good \"I'd want to slap someone\".  And although I wouldn't go that far, I would say it was some of the best Mac n cheese I've had in my life.  In fact, a colleague of mine who joined me for lunch ended up going back the next day and ordered a meal entirely of Mac n cheese.  So we definitely enjoyed ourselves.  Be sure to go if you're in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Went to McKoy's this past Saturday.  I can't speak to the food, since I did not get to try any even after waiting over an hour and a half.  Just more concerned about the management. 

We arrived on what seemed to be a busy night, but they did not seem to have too many folks waiting.  We asked how long the wait was for a 5 person table- the hostess (later found out manager) said \"it could be 10 minutes, it could be 30- we just sat a real big group.\" ALL 5 of us heard the same thing.

She put our name at the top of a new list on paper.

What we did not know- is they just sat 90% of the restaurant as one group, and the group had many more tables arriving over the next hour. They basically had a dinner reservation for over 100 plus people in a place that might not even seat that many.

We waiting over an hour, and I would admit became frustrated.  The hostess, pointed out a table that was \"ours\" when the group left, but then it was given to more arrivals of this huge party. We finally got a bar table for 5 after pushing for it, but heard from the tables around us that they were waiting for food for over 45 minutes- and we decided to give up and eat at Bojangles nearby. 

While I can understand why they were in the situation with a hunder plus person group in the place- I can't understand why the management allowed us to put our name on a list in this situation or even thought anyone would be happy that night!  A group as large as the entire business is coming in for a meal- you have a few options: you don't take the reservation- since you can't give them good service; you close the restaurant and open for this group only, or you at least try to control the situation more by offering the group a limited or pre-ordered menu... 

The staff were frustrated, and were frustrated with us, and we were frustrated with them.... but if they had just planned a bit better or told us the situation before we sat there for a long time- we could have had a good meal at another nearby eatery, and come back and enjoy this otherwie well rated Smokehouse another time.  THE FOOD LOOKED and SMELLED very good! Which in many ways made it even worse to have only seen it!"}
{"text":"Wings and ribs good, but not top notch. 
Mac and cheese the bomb!  Definitely get a double order. Collards great as well!  Service very quick. Glad I tried but won't be back."}
{"text":"From the outside, McKoy's really doesn't look like anything spectacular, just your normal neighborhood restaurant. But once inside, this place definitely has the saloon look & feel.

I've only eaten lunch here, but their lunch menu doesn't disappoint, & they usually have a pretty good special that most people get. And while I know the feel of the place gives off the saloon/biker feel, the food quality & taste will impress you. Their menu has many options, with a big enough selection for even your pickiest eaters. I had more of a southern meal, fried chicken with mac & cheese, & it was pretty good. It wasn't the best fried chicken I'd ever had, but I left full & happy for the price I paid.

Another big thing about McKoy's is the wait staff. They only hire beautiful girls, ones that catch the eyes of their customers. So you'll usually see a lunch crowd of mostly guys. The lunch crowd can get pretty large, so get there early or late to try and beat the line.

McKoy's is tucked away & may take a nod in the right direction for you to notice it, but it's worth the trip when you discover it. McKoy's atmosphere is very inviting & welcoming, along with an excellent menu & food taste that will bring you back again."}
{"text":"Our first BBQ meal in Charlotte.  The place is surrounded by TVs so chances are, your game will be on.  The portion of food you get is enormous so order conservatively.  Waitstaff was very nice and helpful. 

Full Disclosure: not an extreme fan of BBQ so my review may be bias

A-: Smoked Wings (buffalo sauce) - you can definitely taste the smokiness, buffalo sauce was okay, good with ranch

B: Living the Dream (LTD) - a sample of pull-pork, pot roast, chicken and ribs - NOTE: this is more than enough for 2 ppl to share.  Pull-pork was nicely cooked, chicken was smoked but little on the dry side.  Ribs and pot roast was ok. You get 2 types of bbq sauce, a vinegar base and sugary one.

A+: Fried squash - thinly cut and heavily breaded.  LOVED it!  Was still good as leftovers 

A-: Coconut pie - very coconutty. Freshly made, just a little too sweet for my taste.

Overall, a good experience.  Do recommend for out of towners!"}
{"text":"Due to a weather delay I was stuck in North Carolina for the evening. The guy at the hotel front desk suggested some shaddy areas around the hotel for \"decent\" food, he clearly didn't yelp. Thankfully I walked in and out of one of his suggestions and found this gem! 

Seeing as I was around the airport I wasn't getting my hopes up for a fabulous meal, however this place surprised me. The food was great, the wine pour was ample and the atmosphere is what I'd expect from North Carolina- bar/restaurant. 

I got the regular pork platter which came with two sides, I went with the baked potato and green beans. The amount of food was perfect seeing as I was a starving travel!  The staff was friendly and refilled drinks as needed. 

If you are staying at the Clarion Hotel... go about .2 miles and you will stumble upon this gem."}
{"text":"Nicest people ever! Best grilled calypso wings in the world! The bartenders and all the staff are just fabulous!"}
{"text":"The barbecue was cold and certainly nothing to write home about.  I was hoping for some amazing Carolina-style BBQ.  This was not the place.  I should've ventured farther from the hotel in search of the real thing."}
{"text":"Great place!Great food! Called 15 mins ahead of time on a Friday for my birthday party of 17..they had the tables already put together.  The food was delicious and the staff was very nice and attentive.  I highly recommend this place!
The added plus ....there was a 80s tribute band that had flashing lights and a smoke machine.  Twas a great choice for my 30th birthday!"}
{"text":"Really good food and sauces.  Coconut pie was good but over rated.  The slice was very small for 5 bucks.  

For context I was here for work and this place was legit BBQ."}
{"text":"This place serves the best pot roast you can buy in Charlotte. I put off trying this place because they don't serve brisket and while I like pulled pork I don't have the same love affair with it to begin with as I do with some nice juicy beef. Based on the reviews from other Yelpers I decided to go one evening after work to try this famous pot roast and I am now hooked.

We were enthusiastically greeted upon entering and led straight to a table. I ordered a $4 mango mojito which was promptly served and it was as sweet as it was refreshing. Since we were basically starving upon arrival we ordered the appetizer sampler. In hindsight this was too ambitious for just the two of us since we were ordering full diners as well. The nachos and potato skins were delicious and the establishment did not skimp on the cheese. I loved the chicken fingers which were juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside. I am not huge on bone in wings but my dining companion said they were excellent. 

I ordered a soup as one of my fixin's, and it came out before the entrees as requested. It was potato and bacon and super creamy and filling. This could have easily served as an appetizer to hold me over until dinner.

When the mains came (we both opted for pot roast) I saw the soup again and when the waitress saw she remembered that I already had the soup brought out but shrugged and said that I get two soups today. This was totally okay with me - free food is one of my favorite things. The pot roast was completely tender. There was some fat to pick around but the generous portion made me feel like I wasn't being skimped on. They must cook this roast for hours to get the beef so tender. The darker sauce (not sure what it was called, not vinegar based) that was at our table was a great compliment to the pot roast. 

Overall both the food and service were great and I will definitely be back! PS - the leftover pot roast made for great sandwiches the next day."}
{"text":"5 stars across the board for McKoys! The staff and the food really hit a home run for us last week! Being California kids we were anxious to find some good local food...we got that and more. 
First the food; Our rowdy party of three had the LTD (Livnin The Dream) plate, the ribeye steak and a regular ole pulled pork plate. All were fantastic. THe steak was cooked perfectly, the pulled pork was tender and smokey... and the LTD plate was an experience in and of itself. Even the green beans, collard greens and mac n cheese blew our collective socks off. To top it all off... the in house sauces at the table were the proverbial icing on the cake. The house vinegar based sauce was perfect with the pulled pork.
Last, but not least, the staff; Everyone was alot of fun. As I said...we had had a long day and were pretty rowdy. My cohorts even lost the ability to read the menu for some reason, so the waitress had to take extra time explaining the side item choices... or fixxins. She was a great sport, and even kicked some rowdy attitude back in our direction which made for even more fun. The manager also stopped by a few times to check in and had some fun with us, good to see people at least appearing to enjoy their jobs. It made for us having a great experience.
Big Thank You to McKoys! I am not sure when I will be back to Charlotte, but when I am,rest assured I will be back!"}
{"text":"Excellentttttt potato skins (i get them every single time)! Excellent everything actually. My boyfriend and I come in here a lot on Sundays, and we get something different every time. We haven't been disappointed yet :)"}
{"text":"OK we where here twice when we where in Charlotte.  The ribs are really good and they do have yelp specials.  There are a lot of BBQ places in town but you not going to go wrong with McKoy's."}
{"text":"After furiously yelping \"BBQ in Charlotte\", we stopped here on our way down to Hilton Head.  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience here.  Food was awesome, price was reasonable and worth what you get.

Atmosphere: Was more local bar than BBQ restaurant, which I loved.  Casual, unassuming, chill. 

Service: Great!  One of the owners recognized that it was our first time and brought us a sampler platter before we made our choices.  They were obviously very busy, but the service was fast, attentive and just what we needed. 

Food: Started with the grilled wings, which were awesome.  Fall off the bone tender, would 100% recommend them again.  

We wanted to try everything so ordered the Living the Dream platter, comes with chicken, ribs, pulled pork and pot roast.  Chicken and ribs were solid, honestly the chicken in the wing appetizer was way better.  The stars were really the pulled pork and pot roast.  I LOVE pulled pork and this was the best I have ever had.  Flavor without any sauce was juicy and tasty and the sauce options just elevated it.  I've never had bbq pot roast before, but this stuff is bomb.  We couldn't stop eating it.  For sides we got sweet potato fries and mac n cheese, most were great additions.  I mentioned before that the owner gave us a small sampler where we also got to try the greens which were also really good.  The portion for the price is fantastic and totally worth it.  We split the LTD between the two of us and had enough for 2 more dinners left over. 

Overall: I want to drive back to the Carolinas to get more of this BBQ immediately.  I can't stop thinking about it... the pulled pork is having normal appearances in my dreams.  Do yourself a favor and go here immediately."}
{"text":"We chose to visit here from a recommendation by the lady at the front desk at our hotel and I'm glad we came! This place was pretty packed for lunch, but we got a table right away (for 6). I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with slaw on top and Mac & cheese. They had sweet bbq sauce and a mustard or vinegar type bbq sauce. Both were really good. I really liked what I got! It was such a large portion and definitely worth the price. I find that a lot of places just don't do Mac & cheese very well, but that was not the case here. It was creamy, cheesy and flavorful. Other dishes ordered at our table were the pulled chicken sandwich, shrimp & grits, and a loaded baked potato. Everything looked really good and everyone was happy.

If I am in Charlotte again, I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm not at all a motorcycle type gal, so I've driven past McKoy's a thousand times and never even wanted to try it, but today my coworkers decided it was where they wanted to go so it's where I ended up.  They told me the bbq was great so I tried to be optimistic.  

We arrive- it's packed, which I hoped was a sign that it's good food.  But as we continued to sit and wait to have our drink orders taken, I realized why there were so many people in there...  because they were all waiting for some portion of their lunch to happen- ordering, waiting for food, or paying.  It was an agonizing 90 minutes for lunch.  I got fried green tomatoes as my meal.  The guys both got the daily special.  Why the process took so long I don't know.  There seemed to be no waitresses?  Lots of guys wearing McKoys shirts were delivering food, but not many actual waitstaff.  

As the 90 minute mark rolled around, I finally got irritated and added the total roughly in my head and just threw the money on the table and and we left.  An hour and a half for two daily specials, fried green tomatoes and sweet tea?  I think not.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Good food, good service.
I recommend the double grilled wings they were great. The bbq pork platter is great and really with every penny"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place because the reviews were so great, but it really fell flat. I ordered the seafood platter with fried white fish and grilled shrimp, collard greens and potato salad.The white fish was the best thing on the plate, that's the only reason I'm giving 3 stars. The shrimp was BURNT! I was highly annoyed that it was even served to me that way! The potato salad had no salt, and the collard greens lacked flavor. I couldn't believe a place in the south would serve bland potato salad and greens. I wish I had gone to different place for lunch."}
{"text":"Yelpers, you let me down. Went here because of all the great reviews, but this is definitely NOT good pork bbq. Disgusting, actually. Worst I've had anywhere I think. We were expecting a nice smoky flavor and good bbq sauce. We got watery, orange colored mushy meat. And the MUCH better spots: Mac's Speedshop or Smoke uptown.

Yuck. Yuck. Yuck. Hated to spend money here."}
{"text":"I have been really wanting to try this place for
A long time!  Finally went there after work on a Monday evening.

Vibe: it's a biker bar with a neighborhood feel

Service: was impeccable - waitress was very attentive and gave good recommendations - we were in and out in 45 minutes

Food:  We ordered the large BBQ platter and split it.  The BBQ was ok compared to Macs speed shop.  I had to use a ton of sauce to make it tasty.  The mac and cheese was pretty legit.  Green beans were good.  I haven't tried anything else on the menu.  

Overall I'm giving the review based on the vibe and service."}
{"text":"A great visit with an old friend. Plus, they weren't very busy on a Saturday evening. Such great barbecue. Check out their daily specials, the Saturday special was a great deal: 2 meats, 2 sides and an appetizer for $30. The chips and queso was a great appetizer!

Our waitress was very pleasant and knowledgeable! That's always great to have. They don't have a huge selection of beer on draft, but they do support some local breweries."}
{"text":"There's a certain crowd in Charlotte that believe that Mac's is the end-all and be-all when it comes to barbecue.  And that's okay, because while they're cramming themselves into Mac's, I can hang out at McKoy's (so far as I know, there is no relation).

McKoy's is a small place, tucked into a corner on Woodlawn at Old Pineville, where at least two or three places have been since I've been in Charlotte, and if memory serves, McKoy's has been there longer than anything else.

This incarnation is something of an upscale biker bar.  But what they really have is good barbecue.  Not that other food isn't good, but the 'cue is top-notch.

What you need to do, however, is catch them when it is freshest.  Though lunch and dinner can get a bit busy, it's the time to go, because if the meat has been sitting a while, it can dry out, and at that point, it's only as good as Mac's.  That's not bad, it's just not the best  When it's fresh, however, it is as good as it gets - even without the need for sauce (though they have a good vinegar, and I don't even like vinegar).

Also make sure you try their macaroni and cheese, which along with their sweet potato fries are quite possibly the best in town.  The only downside is that it can get a bit smoky inside (no longer a problem now that you can't smoke inside!).  They have a small porch out front, but it's right on Old Pineville - so there is some downside.  Otherwise?  McKoy's rocks."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place with some good ribs while visiting Charlotte.  I've had better but the ribs here were pretty good. The sides could have been better.  The cole slaw was too watery for my liking and the loaded baked potato looked far better than it tasted.  We had the fried green tomato for an appetizer---not feeling that either.  Now the service was GREAT!!!! Very attentive staff--among the best service I've had at a restaurant.

Not in love with the location, needs better signage, and MORE lighting."}
{"text":"Amazing. Had Thai wings and pulled pork. Great value for the money. So good I'm sure I'll be back!"}
{"text":"3rd time here, got wings again, they were still good but a bit overdone. Service great as always. Chicken gumbo soup was on the thin side. Will go pork next time I think!"}
{"text":"I have heard about this place for a while an  finally gave in on a friday nite that i couldnt decide what i wanted to eat lol  Its a bar pretty much :)  I had the BBQ smoked chicken pizza WOW I was blown away.   This bbq chicken was awesome, great smokey flavor, lots of cheese no shortage there.   I had a salad as well the blue cheese dressing tasted homemade mmm  The only disappointment was no grated parm cheese for my pizza come on now you need sprinkle cheese on pizza to finish it off :)  I did order the cornbread that is what we in the south are known  for.  It was the worst cornbread I have ever eaten, it was just cornmeal n cheese but very greasey seems maybe they used  too much veg oil, my advice no veg oil, more  butter an no cheese please :) Very thin as well cornbread should be thick to me anyway.  I will def go back an try something else but I am hooked on that pizza but I guess I'll take some parm cheese to sprinkle myself :)"}
{"text":"Drove into Charlotte looking for some good BBQ before a meeting. Googled on my phone and found McKoy's. 5 Stars all the way on Google, so I had to try it.

Loved it. Had the pork plate (lunch special) w/ Sweet Potato Fries and Spicy Pintos. The meat was sweet and tender. Smoked to perfection. Didn't need a drop of sauce, but I couldn't keep away from their NC-style sauce. The sauce made the Sweet Potato fries even better, and the pintos were a unique addition.

I'll come back here every time I'm in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ great service
Was told it is a bikers bar by a colleague but I would say biker friendly 
Our group of 11 was seated quickly and everything was great
Mac and cheese, fried squash are amazing
Best ribs I've had"}
{"text":"The wings are the best my wife and I have ever Eatin. The atmosphere and food makes this place a winning combination. Every time we have a chance to eat here, we do. Lived in Charlotte a year and haven't found a BBQ joint better."}
{"text":"Went here on the last night of my trip to Charlotte. The food was good, service very friendly, nice vibe, plenty of TVS if you want to watch sports (they had sunday night football on when I was there)......portions were huge. I got the pulled pork plate for one (could also order for two) and it came with two sides. I got Mac & Cheese and Fried Okra (very yummy- first time I got that). Lots of booths. Overall good vibe from this place."}
{"text":"Great solid BBQ with chicken, pork, wings, beef, and ribs cooked all ways! Never been during a sporting event so not sure how crowded it gets, but otherwise, the service is good and quick. We always seem to migrate towards the McKoy's BBQ sandwich and we've tried the LTD (Livin' the Dream), a platter of meat, which is a great way to sample their main offerings. My only disappointment is they don't appear to have fried onion rings, one of my favorite fixins with BBQ, so the fried squash will have to be my dose of veggies. They also have a Yelp special for a late night menu if you go in after 10PM."}
{"text":"Delicious food (bbq pork, fried chicken, and Mac n cheese were excellent). Portions were generous. Very convenient for eating on the way to or from the Charlotte airport. Next time I'm trying the St. Louis ribs."}
{"text":"One of our usual lunch spots back when I worked close by! Great food, friendly staff, and awesome owners who always checked up on us when we were there. This is the place to go to if you're craving authentic southern cooking. You can tell everything is fresh and that they really do go by grandma's recipes. The fried squash is a must try. Their daily lunch specials are great and an awesome incentive to try out different things on the menu."}
{"text":"To me, barbecue is a bit like pizza...even when it's not great, it's still really good. But McKoy's is pretty delicious in its own right and is a definite barbecue competitor in Charlotte. 

I didn't sit inside, so I'll just comment on the outdoor space. The porch area is really great to grab a meal with friends, have a drink and just chill. Do I wish the view was better? Sure, but hey, there's not much you can do about that! Our server was very sweet, friendly and helpful. She made sure we enjoyed our meal, our glasses were full and beers kept a-coming. 

On to the food...I ordered the small barbecue platter with green beans and mac 'n cheese. Yay for two sides! The 'cue was solid - a pile plump pulled pork. My only gripe? It was on the dry side...I felt like I really had to douse on the sauce. The sides, however, were just about perfect. The mac 'n cheese was nom worthy, baked in all its goodness. And the green beans were a total surprise - fresh, crisp green beans with a very light saute in garlic and other tasty concoctions. It's a rarity that I find something fresh (not fried or saucy) at a NC bbq joint. 

To wrap up the meal, I just had to order dessert after I heard about coconut pie. Yes, coconut pie. This slice of heaven was reminiscent of a mashup of pecan pie and a macaroon. It's truly swoon worthy, especially when it's warmed and topped with whipped cream. I'll go back *just* for the pie. McKoy's is definitely on my 'cue short list in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"The smoked wings were delicious! The pulled pork was just the right amount of smoke and salt. I wasn't crazy about the cornbread but the potato salad was awesome."}
{"text":"Raise your hand if you come here for the pasta salad. Just me? Oh, okay. 

If you don't like wings, you are not allowed to join me for a meal here. Why? Because it doesn't matter if I'm full or not very hungry when I walk in the door, we're getting wings as an app. They are smoked in house, grilled, and freaking delicious. My favorite sauce is the calypso. It's a mix of terriyaki and buffalo. Finally, someone who gets me. Other places look at me strangely when I ask if it's possible to mix those two sauces together. I agree with the lovely Allyson D, I am a fan of the queso as well. 

Now don't get me wrong, I'm a girl that can get down with barbecue. However, my go to here (after the wings) is a veggie plate because I am obsessed with their pasta salad. They also have some of the best mac and cheese in the city. Hi, I'm Nikki and I order the veggie plate with the most calories. The fried squash is made in house, not frozen. Green beans, collard greens, if I didn't have any self control I would probably order a six item veggie plate. 

McKoy's has a cool dive and biker bar type feel to it. When the weather warms up, they do a weekly bike night. I've always had great service here. Good drink, lunch, dinner, and happy hour (food) specials throughout the week. Check out there Facebook page or website for the latest. There's also plenty of TVs (if you're into that kind of thing)."}
{"text":"Pretty OK selection of beer bottles and draught which is what I was after. The whole family really lived the smoked wings. They were meaty and delicious!

I also had the pork sandwich - great meat and slaw wasn't overpowering. The sauces are at the table but weren't as good as I would expect for a BBQ joint but they weren't bad by any means. 

Other positives: actual Mac & cheese, a sizable pile of fried okra as a side, meaty tenders for the kids (they all left full) and touchtunes!"}
{"text":"Great food reasonable prices. Must try the Mac & Cheese!"}
{"text":"Thank you yelp!   This was divine.  We split the wings- I loved the buffalo she loved the Thai chili- and the best BBQ sandwich I've ever had.  And we've had lots of BBQ across the south."}
{"text":"Right on my way home makes this a great place to get takeout for dinner. My first visit we chose the BBQ Pork Platter with a cup of BBQ Chicken, Mac And Cheese & Coleslaw. Very moist meats & great sides! Still enough for my work lunch pail the next day. On the next visit I received an Email from Yelp about the Friday Ribeye Special. When the waitress set silverware down I told her it was for takeout per email which did not mention dine in only. Did not skip a beat, verified with manager & sent me home with a delicious, tender Steak with mushrooms, mashed taters & veggies. I will be stopping here for supper both sit down & takeout many more times. The employees are nice, friendly & welcoming to a new Charlotte resident. The food is fresh & homemade. I forgot the coconut pie we had on first visit! Save room for this epic pie, WOW."}
{"text":"Highly recommend! Employees were nice and service was super quick. The queso dip is super delicious. All food was fresh and served with a smile. A++!"}
{"text":"If your looking for great BBQ, DO NOT go to McKoy's Smokehouse. The service was nothing special. The smoked meat had no flavor at all. The BBQ sauce did not even help the taste of the meat. A group of us went there and no one from our group of eight was pleased. They did give large portions of food, but who really wants dry leftovers. Unless you enjoy dry tasteless meat, look elsewhere. 1 star is for the food being edible and the other comes for the so-so sides. We ate at Midtown smokehouse earlier in the week and would strongly recommend it over this place."}
{"text":"Delicious place! I got the shrimp and grits and they were awesome! My friend got the LTD and although he was starving, barely got through half of it! He said it was fantastic too."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance. Ok BBQ.  No brisket which was a disappointment.  Their Mac &Cheese was superb!  Good coleslaw, dry but ok St Louis style ribs.  
Good place overall.  Ok prices."}
{"text":"Loved Kelly's service. I had fried chicken with slaw and fried squash. Awesome night and they let us watch rugby."}
{"text":"The smoke house wings are darn perfection! Great sauces the Thai Chili Wings  Mac N Cheese  Green Beans  and detailed customer service  oh yeah the chicken quesadillas are ... I'm not a pork guy and no beef ribs but GREAT spot."}
{"text":"I really thought I was going to have an excellent BBQ dinner but it didn't happen.  I had the prime rib. Over cooked. No flavor. Needed to dump a gallon of sauce on it.  Baked potato was horrible. I asked for a substitute. No chance.  Someone else had the 20 wings. Most sauces were bland and unflavorfull. Someone else had the sampler platter. All was lumped together and crappy.  Not impressed. Maybe it was the service. I felt like a problem once i asked for things."}
{"text":"If you HATE delicious Mac and cheese, battered fried squash, tender and juicy pulled pork and great service--this isn't the place for you. Our first experience here...but certainly not our last. Way to go, Ryan Register!  You're definitely doing something right here at McKoy's!"}
{"text":"Great food. Had the pot roast. Wife had the half rack of ribs. But portions and was able to somehow finish mine washed down with a good beer. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Smoked. Wings. Mic drop. The smoked wings were outrageously good. I had the sweet bbq sauce on them. You could taste the flavor of the wood they used to smoke them. I'm no foodie, so I can't really put in to words what I was experiencing. I also had the Monday special Meatloaf with mashed and green beans. Delicious. Only $11 too which was a solid deal. Check this place out for sure."}
{"text":"Pot roast is where it's at! Or bring someone along and split the L.T.D. The side dishes are very good too."}
{"text":"So good!  Impressed with the casual atmosphere, the prompt service and the amazing food!  If you are looking for barbeque, look no further!"}
{"text":"The smoke/grilled wings are the best I've had in town! Found my new favorite go to bbq spot! Great atmosphere, very clean, and very attentive wait staff."}
{"text":"Every time I come down to Charlotte I always make time to come here.  Everything I have had has been great.  If you get the wings pay the extra for the double grilled... I think that is what they called it.  It adds a crispy feel and extra flavor.  The prices are reasonable and the service is great."}
{"text":"I love this place! I go here multiple days a week for lunch. The staff is amazing. I don't eat much meat, so I usually get the veggie platter with collard greens, green beans and spicy pinto beans. The green beans in particular are exceptionally good. There's a really nice patio, so when the weather is good it's an awesome place to sit out and  get some vitamin D."}
{"text":"I used to really enjoy coming here when I lived in Charlotte.  I don't get back often, so I had to get some of their grilled wings to take back to MD during my recent visit for the game.

So after a 6 HR drive, I was super excited to get home and eat my wings, after all these are some of the best wings I've had in my life.  How upset I was when I opened my to go box to find only six of the 12 wings I ordered.  I had a split flavor order (barbalo and calypso), but only had the 6 barbalo.  

I immediately called and asked to speak to the manager.  Although she was nice, she almost sounded like she didn't believe me.  I gave her the check # and all.  She kept reiterating so you ordered 12?  Umm yea you see it on the ticket, and there isn't even an option to order 6, at least I didn't see one on the menu.

So she promises me the head manager will call me in a day or so.  It was Monday, and today is Thursday, and I haven't heard a word.  It's only $6 or so, but it's the principle.  I essentially paid almost $18 for 6 wings and pasta salad, and I gave the bartender a $2 tip.  Had I known she was giving me half my order, I would've kept the tip.  So $20 for 6 wings and pasta salad?  Now while I'd agree it's just as much my job to check my order to make sure it's correct, it's also their job to make sure they are giving you what you ordered.  

While I used to love the wings, I definitely won't be back here.  If they do this to a couple customers a day, someone's getting over.  Definitely NOT the McKoy's I was used to when I lived in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Good and smokey pulled pork. If you get the coleslaw on top, just know the bun won't stand up to it. Really good smoked wings, and the ribs have been tried and approved on other visits with colleagues. Vinegar BBQ sauce seemed more vinegar than anything else. Tomato based sauce is flavorful with a more normal consistency. Non-threatening biker bar atmosphere."}
{"text":"Excellent! Ate here with 3 other people so I was able to try 4 dishes -ribs, chicken, smoked pot roast and the shrimp and grits.  Every dish was fantastic especially the smoked post roast. The chicken, ribs and roast had a nice smoky flavor. Good food, fair portions and decent service- this place is a winner!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner.  I had great service and lots of attention.  I like the country feel of the place and there are plenty of TV's for watching sports. I'd like it during happy hour.
The Q was so-so.  Ribs were dry, pulled pork was not fully seasoned.  Smoke was about right for pulled pork, but too little for the chicken.  The Fried Okra was good, but not special.   Beer variety is respectable.  I saw 8 beers on tap.  I liked the iced tea.
Don't come here for spectacular barbecue, but it's a nice place to get together with people and have something to eat."}
{"text":"Good place to go grab a few drinks and some food after work.
Please ask your waiter for the nightly specials.  The wings are to die for.
Also the crowd in the bar is awesome !!!  Very nice service and people."}
{"text":"Really great place for a quick bite. My wife and I were in town on business and this was one of the closest places to the hotel. We didn't drink this particular night, so can't offer review of bar, but the food and service was great. 

I can't say enough about the staff - they worked together to make sure we were happy. The food was quick and delicious, with the exception of the side caesar salad (too much cheap dressing). Prime rib was to die for. 

If you're in the area, definitely check this place out. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Fried squash was a bit salty...even for the kids so that says a lot, but I still liked it.  I had the LTD and pork was a bit bland, ribs was probably best on menu and soup of the day was great, kids loved it.  I was referred over here by the Four Points Sheraton next door and received a 10% off my meal coupon but the waitress would only apply 10% off one entree.  I talked to the hotel about it and they confirmed it should have been the whole meal.  Felt a bit \"bait and switched\" by the restaurant after that experience."}
{"text":"Top notch!! This place has it going on both with the food & service!! Went here last night with a few friends and had a great time. The BBQ pork platter with mac &cheese & cole slaw was awesome! The BBQ didn't even need sauce but I tried some anyways. Yum! My wife ordered their pot roast. Now, let me say this. At first she wasn't sure if she wanted to try it because it wasn't the traditional pot roast (carrots, potatoes, etc...) but they brought her a sample, yep, a sample to try. I've seen this done at bars when it comes to wine or beer, but actually sampling an entree, nicely done sir!! No brainer, she ordered it. It was so much food, we took it home & it feed both of us for dinner the next night. We tried a couple desserts too. The deep fried cheesecake was outstanding! Of course you can't go wrong with OMB's Copper on draft! We even had one of the brother's who owns the place come by a chat with us for a bit. You could tell he took pride in the food they were serving. Can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. The pot roast wasn't extremely fatty which I liked, the sides were delicious, corn bread was very southern style but I loved it! No complaints about the food. The service was a little slow but I wasn't in a rush."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. The fried okra was on point. I was hoping the ribs would be more of the fall off the bone type, but they weren't. It was good and I would go back. Really enjoyed the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was good service was horrible. I had really high hopes for this place because I've heard good things. But our waitress had no idea what she was doing. Almost everything we ordered she messed up. And asking her about food and drink specials was about a 10 minute process.  I feel bad for her because clearly she wasn't trained right or was not meant to be in the service industry.  Either way, I blame the management for that. And my beer wasn't that cold either. Smh...."}
{"text":"I live relatively close to this place and for years drove right past it.  I finally stopped in and I was glad I did.  If the smell of the smokers doesn't clue you in, the food will clear up any mystery.  

I will say the place is more of a saloon feel than a restaurant, which I like.  The lunch crowd varies quite a bit, but the place is a biker bar, so you will see some guys in their leathers hanging out... which again, is cool, don't let them get in your way of some good food.  

On to the food, I keep hearing rave reviews about Mac's on this site and when Mac's opened I'd say they were the best, but the quality there has dropped as their business has picked up.  McKoy's has some of the best bbq I've had, great smokey flavor, good portions and good sauces to throw on top.  They continue to smoke their bbq in a manner that maintains that great subtle smokey flavor, where in my opinion Mac's has lost that smokiness that once made it so good. 

I also branched out and tried their hot wings- as I'm a huge wing fan.  McKoy's served up some really good wings.  Again, great flavor, a little extra seasoning than most bar wings and they were cooked perfectly, not rubbery but not charcoal either.  

If you're looking for good bbq and a place with a good set of other options, give McKoy's a shot... they'll make you forget all about that speedshop up the street."}
{"text":"We had a dinner meeting in Charlotte and this restaurant was chose for our meal out. The service was extremely slow. (due to not enough wait staff and i think lack of cooks). The atmosphere was loud and crowded. We finally got our food after and hour and a half. Much of it was cold or dry. My shrimp was burned on one side they were willing to replace the shrimp. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"One of the best meals I have had in a very long time! A group of six of us all had different items and all of it was amazing! The ribs are to die for and the service was great despite being somewhat busy Saturday night. This is a must eat place when visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"I would say the food is average at best.  Got the ribs which were pretty dry.  Wings were ok.  I went for the double grilled and all it did was burn the bbq sauce on it.   Okra was good but a little salty and mashed potatoes were good and you could tell made fresh as there were some small chunks of potato in them.   Staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"Great smoked meat and sides! My pot roast didn't need extra sauce, as the flavor was perfect as is. The pulled pork, okra, collards, cole slaw, and Mac and cheese were delicious. Service was excellent, and beer was cold."}
{"text":"The wings are exceptional here. Some of the best, if not the best that I've ever had. Just let the bartender staff give you their recommendations and you will love the food. I wish we could do 1/2 star ratings as I'd give the place 4.5 stars. I'll hit this place again tomorrow for the Rockets game."}
{"text":"Great service!!! You can tell someone was in their grandmother's recipe book because it had grandma cookin all over!! Hidden gym gem never knew it was there happy we found it! Keep it up 
Agent89 Stamp of approval"}
{"text":"The food comes in large proportions, BBQ is so tender and even the southern fries chicken is juicy. Made the mistake of thinking it was boneless chicken breasts but it was delicious."}
{"text":"Best southern food in Charlotte. Expect to be stuffed when you leave. This is a blue collar joint and don't get out of line with the locals at the bar. The bikers that don't want to associate with the posers at Mac's come here. Try the Mac and cheese. Your heart will stop for a little bit but you'll be back for more"}
{"text":"I decided to make this a BBQ weekend so I headed out to try McKoy's Smokehouse.  When I got out of my car I could smell smoke in the air which is usually a good sign.  The place wasn't very busy at all and I could pretty much sit anywhere.  I got the LTD (Living the Dream) which comes with pretty much all their meats plus two sided.  The meats were ribs (2-bones), BBQ pork, pit pot roast, and smoked BBQ chicken.  For the sides I got fries and slaw.  My food came out pretty quickly.  It all looked good except for the pit pot roast which had a huge chunk of fat on it.  The ribs and chicken had sauce on them, the pork and the pot roast did not.  The pork was moist and had a subtle smoky flavor.  It wasn't as tender as I like though, but it wasn't tough by any means.  The ribs weren't quite falling off the bone tender, but they very close as well.  Their flavor was OK.  The chicken also had a nice smoke flavor and tasted good.  I don't really like sauce on my BBQ, but the sauce on the ribs and chicken was light which was OK.  The pit pot roast was the best I thought.  It was moist and fall apart tender.  It had caramelized onions along with it as well.  There were two types of BBQ sauce, a tomato sauce which had a little bite to it and a vinegar sauce.  The vinegar sauce looked like it was just that.  It was way too watery so I stuck with the tomato based sauce.  It worked OK with the meat and was great to dip my fries into.  The service was good as well.  McKoy's doesn't have the best BBQ in Charlotte, but it was good.  Better than most places I have been to so far."}
{"text":"Wholly cow AMAZING!!! This was by far the best bbq place I've been too in a long time. Pulled pork sandwich was amazingly tender, Mac n cheese was like moms, and the mashed potatoes and gravy...yum!!! Oh I almost forgot, the wings are snack your momma good. THE BEST BBQ WINGS IVE EVER HAD!"}
{"text":"I don't usually go out of my way to write a review but I just couldn't wait for this one. I wanted to make sure I remembered everything because if I could give only a half star, I would. I went there for lunch with two of my crew members. First mistake, we were waiting for a table and were forgotten about. Finally get a table and I ask for a seperate check, she gave all three of us seperate checks even though the two guys wanted theirs together. I ordered tea, the first guy I was with ordered half tea, half sweet tea, and the next guy ordered sweet tea. All three tasted exactly the same. Like very watered down sweet tea. Our glasses reached empty and stayed that way until we asked for a refill. We all ordered the Friday special, fried chicken. I ordered the shrimp chowder as one of my sides. Lots of fish, no shrimp in it.One of my friends ordered the side salad and they forgot his silverware. When we flagged down a waitress to get some, she didn't even apologies for the mistake. No matter that it's unhealthy, I love chicken skin but this one was so burnt it had that burnt crunch and burnt taste. I couldn't eat it. The chicken piece itself was unidentifiable as any piece I'm used to and so dry I had to put some of the bbq sauce they had on the table on it. The mac and cheese was good as long as it stayed hot. While fighting my chicken with a fork and knife because it was so hot, the mac and cheese cooled and got greasy. When  we got our checks all three were dumped in the middle of the table and they were all mixed up in the three black check folders. So bad we all went to Bojangles after. Should have just gone there to begin with."}
{"text":"3 stars only because the food was good, not great but good. Too noisy with some kind of music I couldn't identify, with way too much base.  Our server Marilyn was having a bad night or just doesn't have a personality.  Maybe locals like it, but I wouldn't recommend to a friend.  Would not come back due to noise level & poor service."}
{"text":"Normally when someone tells me to go to a biker bar for good food, I ignore them. But then again is it ever considered normal for someone to suggest a biker bar for dinner? I was feeling adventurous so I gave it a shot. 

It's not so much a biker bar as a biker inspired bar. I didn't see one Hog parked out front, however the interior is decorated with Hog Memorabilia and various motorcycle knick knacks.

The food is what we were there for, so that's what I'll review. The mac n cheese is the real deal Holyfield, complete with a perfectly browned top from being baked in the oven the way mac n cheese should be. 

The greenbeans were so good I ordered them as an extra side and the blackened seafood platter was a hit. Spicy enough with out being too greasy. 

They even had vegetarian options which is almost unheard of in Charlotte, much less at a BBQ joint. Needless to say I'm a fan and I can't believe it took me so long to find this place! 

Oh yea and all of that was under $20! Priced to move."}
{"text":"Food and service = great

Ambiance = good only if you like biker bars, rowdy middle aged people, and not with family

So, beyond all awkwardness from a city boy like myself, this place actually has really good BBQ and attentive service.

The post happy hour crowd was a bit rowdy...broken glasses and choice language.  There's even a sign up front that kids aren't allowed after 10pm.  

Had the ribs, pulled pork, and stuff like that.  Ribs were really good and meaty."}
{"text":"So as we were headed toward Charlotte Douglas airport, they had the Masters on all of the TVs in the bar so that was cool cuz we wanted to watch who won.  I went on Yelp to find some good eats 
The food was ok 
Not the best BBQ I have had but not the worst. 
I tried the sampler plate and my husband had the BBQ chicken with mac & cheese and fries. 
Like I said it was just ok. 
But before I left I went to the bathroom and discovered there was NO SOAP in the bathroom!
Fortunately I was able to find a little soap on the back of the dispenser. 
But...does that mean the employees are not washing their hands?!
Not in the bathroom anyways. 
I did let them know, they didn't seam surprised. 
SCARY!!!!"}
{"text":"While I was looking for a good fried chicken place, this place caught my eyes. I already got disappointed with Bonchon chicken branch here but kept looking for the best chicken that will prove southern chicken pride! 

Anyway, we ordered friend chicken and coleslaw, mac and cheese for two sides that come with. Also pulled pork and fried squash. The thin breaded chicken was crispy and juicy inside. The pulled pork was very tender and I liked their BBQ sauce. For side, I really liked fried squash! Fried but not heavy! Coleslaw was good enough and mac and cheese was rich. For dessert, we had fried cheese cake with cinnamon powder and sugar frosted on the top. The cheese filling was soft and crispy outside but too sweet for me. The food was overall great. 

It says the chicken will take around 20minutes to get served. You will need some patience to try great chicken. My journey to find the best chicken will go on..."}
{"text":"Decent foods, good portions, fair selection of beers. 
Games on the TV's and decent staff.

Good place to grub and beer :)"}
{"text":"Very friendly biker bar with great food and live outdoor entertainment. Loved it!!!

Was visiting from out of town with a friend.  We dined there twice and had takeout once. It's all about the fried okra!!!

I also had a BBQ sandwich - delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ special on Thursday. Great flavor, generous portions, great selection and quality of sides and very friendly service. Not to mention a fun place to eat lunch. Going back to try out their other daily specials. Fun C&W memorabilia on the walls also."}
{"text":"great food but last time the service was beyond slow... most people there during weekday lunch are professionals on their lunch break, we gave our order, got our food and I think our waitress decided to take a lunch break of her own... sat there for 20 minutes waiting on a box/check...
their bbq chicken sandwich w/the potato salad is my go to... its HUGE always enough to eat later and its even better a 2nd time!"}
{"text":"I am visiting Charlotte for work and took to Yelp for food recommendations. This was the closest to my hotel so a coworker and I tried it out. We both got the ribs, I got mac and cheese and the fried squash, I loved it all. The place was packed, which is usually a good sign especially for a Wednesday! Service was prompt as well. Good portions for meat, pretty standard portions for sides. I could have eaten more sides, but I'm glad I didn't. I took home left overs, who doesn't love ribs for breakfast?! I'm here for another week and if I can't find other places to check out, I would definitely go back and try the chicken, that looked great as well!"}
{"text":"Holy crap how had I never been here before?!

My friend talks about how good it is all the time. I figured she was right, but I'm pretty picky when it comes to certain things: like mac n cheese. If it's not amazing, I'm unimpressed. Same with blue cheese dressing. 

This place does not even look like it would have better than slightly-above-average food. I loved the low-key biker bar feel. I did not expect everything to taste quite as good as it did. The buffalo chicken sandwich had just the right thickness for a bun - not too much; I hate when it's so bready the sandwich seems dry. Nope, not a problem here. The fries were good and not overly-salted (in fact, I added a little salt, which is rare for me). The buffalo sauce was delicious, and the blue cheese dressing was homemade and so good.

I tasted a bite of my friend's mac n cheese and she's lucky I didn't just grab the rest off of her plate ...

The only downfall to our visit is our food took quite a long time to come out. But the owner apologized to us and the waitress said the kitchen was just really backed up. My friend didn't indicate that this was a regular problem, so no big deal.

My only problem is going to be what to order next time! Everything else on the menu looks so good, too!"}
{"text":"McCoy's is the real deal I had dinner in this Super-Smokehouse last night...... the chicken wings are awesome and the ribs are meaty, smoky, and worth every bite. The service was great very friendly/helpful and the owner came over to check on everything !!! This is a must -try spot for BBQ and don't skip the onion rings. I cannot wait to have another business meeting in town because i could not finish the plates very generous portions especially on the combo meat selections so i could not sample all the items i wanted to try. They need to open one of these in NYC .... SOON !!!"}
{"text":"Yes. Do the smoked BBQ chicken or pork. Be warned the portions are huge. 

Dan enjoyed a plain old pork BBQ with mashed taters and gravy. He skipped the beans when he heard they were garlicky.

I did the smoked, pulled chicken with a side of mac n cheese. Could only finish 1/2 the sandwich, it was so big.

The bartender highly recommends the smoked wings and fried zucchini.

If we are through town, we'll stop again. It's not a huge space and they might get really busy. Easy to get to from 71."}
{"text":"Was looking for a good BBQ place while in Charlotte on a business trip, and I'm oh, so glad I found McKoy's - the food was amazing.  Being rather indecisive, I went with the sampler (ribs, chicken, pork, pot roast), and everything on the plate was delicious, especially the pot roast (if I ever go back, I'm absolutely getting more of that). Bar atmosphere, with lots of TVs showing different games/events, and music playing on the juke box. Service was quick & friendly. Next time I'm in Charlotte, it will be on my must-go list."}
{"text":"Had a pulled pork sandwich with fries.  Was there for lunch so no beer.  Good pork and good sauces."}
{"text":"I have heard great things about McKoys but I was terribly disappointed.  The owner was really nice when we walked in and told us about all the great food.  We ordered the wings based on his recommendation.  We wanted 20, 10 plain, 10 with some kind of hot sauce they had and we got them extra crispy.  We had to pay 1.50 extra for a dozen for being extra crispy.  They came out soggy, full of sauce, and just cold and gross.   I think either the waitress just poured on sauce right before she brought them out or just forgot about them.  I also ordered the fries extra crispy for my son.  I told the waitress that the wings were soggy and she took the sauce ones but left the plain ones.  It took forever to come back out.  Also another guy brought the fries to our table and then dropped them.  He immediately brought some back out but of course they were not crispy like we had previously ordered.  My husband ordered the pulled pork, mac and cheese, and pasta salad.  He liked his meal.  The service was also terrible.  When we got our bill, they not only charged for the wings but $3.00 extra for being crispy.  We were pretty upset with that because of the fact that we had to send them back and because if it's per dozen, then why is it $3.00 for 20? Isn't a dozen 12? The waitress knew her service was terrible and even apologized for it.  This was nice of her but if she knew our experience was that bad, then I don't see why she didn't try to fix it at all while we were there.  I did really like the carrots and celery with the wings the best and the ranch was awesome."}
{"text":"I have driven by here many times and never even though about stopping in.  A  friend brought me on Saturday and I am a fan! The smokehouse smell hits you before you even get out of the car.  The ribs and Mac and cheese were amazing!  The service was fantastic and prices reasonable.  The two dollar beer special was a nice bonus too!  The light rail is right next door.  If you're the type that is bothered by bikers, then avoid this place!  We sat outside on the covered patio.  There was a TV out there and we were able to enjoy the USC/Auburn and UNC/Clemson games.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I love wings, and I don't care for run of the mill wings. If they're unique or special in some way I really appreciate that. The smoked wings here are excellent! I tried the barb-balo sauce and it was great. For my meal I had the smoked pot roast for something different, and it was. Huge portion. You won't leave hungry. It had a big chunk o' fat included but I think that's so it doesn't get dry during smoking. That's fine because there's no way I could have eaten it all. It was pretty tasty. Tender enough that you could hold a piece on your fork and just shake it apart! Good crowd of folks and nice friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow this has to be one of the best places hidden in Charlotte these smoked grilled wings were the best I've ever had you can not get better food then this and the grill is open till 1 am."}
{"text":"Great smoked wings - but very Smokey. They pulled pork was delicious, as expected, but the Mac and cheese was next level. Best man and cheese I've had in a long time. Great atmosphere if you like sports bars."}
{"text":"We were traveling with our dog and wanted to find a pet friendly place to eat. McKoy's was exactly what we were looking for. We stopped there twice (on our way and back from our destination) and both times we were very pleased with the service and food. The staff was friendly and attentive both times and provided our pup with cold water with ice cubes. The outside seating is covered and several fans were running with mist. It was hot outside but we were comfortable. They have a TV mounted outside and some music in the background. There is some traffic noise but it didn't bother us. We split a platter of barbecue the first time and it was very good. I think it was called the LTD (Living the Dream) platter or something similar. We got to sample a bit of everything. Very good. The second time we stopped our experience was very similar with the exception of no mist with the fans. We didn't say anything since it was a bit cooler that afternoon. We decided to try there double grilled wings and also split the BLFGT wrap with a side of fried squash. The wings were just how we like them...crispy and tasty. The wrap was so good and the fried squash was AMAZING! I'd go back just for it."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, the best wings I have ever had. 

Smoked wings with an awesome Thai Chili sauce. All sorts of sauce choices. The double crisp option ($1.50 extra) is an absolute must. 

Decent draft beer selection.  Bud, the bartender, was super friendly. 

Great casual bar/ restaurant.  Couple steps above classic hole in the wall. 

Tons of big screen TVs.  Every NFL game available. 

Second time I have eaten here in 3 days.   Very solid BBQ place.  

If you are in Charlotte, worth the trip."}
{"text":"Worth 5 stars!! In from out of town and picked this restaurant based on recent reviews. I ordered the Tito's French Cocktail to drink (okay two actually) and the pork nachos. These are NOT your average nachos - outstanding and even better with the BBQ sauce on top. My nine year old ordered the kids ribs with green beans and ate every bite. Great service by Amanda and food came fast. Would come back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious pulled pork and Mac and cheese. I also ordered the sweet potato fries, but felt they were slightly underdone. The atmosphere was open and casual."}
{"text":"Good food and good service. Nice country atmosphere with lots of tv's and they have a decent beer selection. The best thing was the wings, get them double grilled and you won't be sorry. Amazing. But otherwise, it was good food and a nice place to eat and hang out."}
{"text":"I ate there twice this week as  I'm new in town. Service was good the food was good I would've like to see some brisket on the menu."}
{"text":"The food is great the smoked pot roast and the country fried steak. And got a tee shirt"}
{"text":"Very easy to get to airport from here, about 15 min. Good variety of choices on the menu. No identified Gluten Free items but I was able to find plenty of things I could eat. Server was pleasant. Lemonade is homemade and you get one refill. You do however get unlimited refills on sodas. 
The chicken wings were awesome. We got 6 buffalo style - twice grilled as recommended here by other reviewers. They were extra crispy and not too spicy. 
We both ordered the pork plate. The small is plenty of pork! My husband ordered the large and was unable to eat it all. They have both ketchup based BBQ sauce and vinegar based BBQ sauce on the table. Collard greens were good but spicy. I'm not a big fan of the spiced up version some places do. Gas station right next door so we topped off the rental car tank and we were at the airport in no time!"}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret !!!!! I love the smoked wings ( make sure to tell them you want them double grilled ).  Tons of different flavors to choose from ! Not at pull kind of girl but all my friends love it . Amazing Mac and cheese and veggies . This place comes off as some sort of biker bar which I think scares some people off but TRUST me the staff is very friendly . Everyone is welcome there ! They make everyone feel like family"}
{"text":"Best damn food we've had on the road! 
We travel the country too! 
Smoked pot roast is phenomenal 
The wings (double smoked) are freaking tasty
The pork is juicy and full of smoked flavor
Mac and cheese- damn it's the bomb real cheese too! Oh the fried squash hmmm 
And most of all the collard greens- wow just real good!! The atmosphere is great and the ladies are sweet and very pretty too! I've had lunch 3 days in a row while working at the VA hospital!
I hope I come back soon!!"}
{"text":"The food was DELICIOUS! They have the BEST mac & cheese in the world. I'm talking bout some delicious old school mac. The smoked wings, ribs and potato salad was awesome also."}
{"text":"Met some people for McKoys for lunch and it was a good decision.

I had the pulled pork sandwich and it was tasty and well priced.  Also, with a side of mac&cheese fill me up perfectly.    

2 things to be on the look out here for.
1 -  They won't seat you until you entire party is there.  I was 2 mins late to the door and had to make everyone wait to be seat.
2 - Beware getting seat outside.  The traffic noise is really loud.  They need to install some more bush is some type of sound barrier.  It was hard to talk one another out there."}
{"text":"The best country food & BBQ in Charlotte! This is a more friendly & less chain-like than Macs. I haven't ever had anything here that I didn't like. All the sides are awesome; fried squash, collards, mac & cheese!"}
{"text":"Service was good waitress was nice. We got the ltd it was ok dry thoughwasn't impressed  meat was dry and bland tasting . We were there last night"}
{"text":"Kind of confused how people call this the best BBQ they've had. The winds were decent, and the service was good. However the pork was flavorless. Don't be afraid to use the salt, folks. Also the Mac and cheese should just be called \"cheese.\" Was a puddle of melted cheese with zero salt. Everything was just super bland."}
{"text":"My wife and I were here on a sunny afternoon and decided to eat inside. Not very busy as the dinner hour was just beginning. We had excellent service from a friendly waitress who kept drinks refilled and didn't seem to mind that we did not save room for dessert.

My wife opted for the pulled pork platter and she must have really enjoyed it because there wasn't much left at the end. I managed to snag a piece and it was moist and tasty.

For my main, I chose the half barbecue chicken. A good amount of sauce on this bird kept it moist and the meat tore off easily with a well wielded knife and fork. The potato salad was excellent, mixed through with egg. The mac & cheese was also very good with a firm consistency that was more noodles than cheese. Tasty. A very good portion of chicken and sides.

Definitely will return. Maybe I won't wait five years next time..."}
{"text":"Good lunch but service is a little slow, but that's what you get with a popular place.  Would you really want to be the only person at a restaurant, how good would THAT food be..."}
{"text":"I'm amazed how this place has so many stars! 

The BBQ sauce is horrible, the pulled pork is a soggy mess, the fries taste freezer burnt, the ribs are over cooked, the mac n cheese is disgusting, and the potato skins are burnt, old potatoes. 

Absolutely disgusting!"}
{"text":"I'm working in Charlotte this week so I turned to Yelp for gastronomical guidance. At first glance, McKoy's nothing fancy. I drove by it and didn't notice it as they're tucked in behind a gas station. The building is relatively large, but nondescript. It has a nice covered patio that is dog-friendly. 

I liked this place so much I had dinner there twice this week. 

The first meal was the pot roast with mac and cheese and mashed potatoes and gravy. The menu describes the pot roast is marinated. Whatever they do to it, the meat is flavorful with a hint of bbq sauce, and tender. No knife needed here. The meat was a huge chunk that accepted my fork easily. The mashed potatoes were perfect. I fell in love with the mac and cheese. Nice and cheddary (is that a word?), it is baked and has a nice crust on top. The server, Stephanie, was great and came by frequently to check on me and refill my drink. I left stuffed and happy.

Tonight, my boss was in town and she likes good food like I do, so I figured McKoy's would be a good dinner option. I was raving about the pot roast, so she decided to order it. We split a basket of the fried squash. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with more mac and cheese. My boss loved the pot roast; it was just as tender as I described. The pulled pork came with coleslaw and a toasted bun. The pork was tender and smokey. No bbq sauce for this. 

The fried squash is even better cold, and it was still crisp.

Tonight's server was okay. She didn't come around much and refilled my club soda with regular water. 

I asked my local employee about McKoy's and he said it was okay, but the atmosphere was fun. Really? His #2 BBQ place didn't impress me much. If I lived in Charlotte, I would definitely be visiting McKoy's often."}
{"text":"Always a great experience! I come to McCoy's whenever I'm in Charlotte because I know I can always count on a very friendly and attentive staff, great food and a fun time!"}
{"text":"Wow. Barbalo wings were awesome. Pot roast was awesome. Service was awesome. I will be coming back on my next trip down."}
{"text":"We have been to McKoys twice now and are ready to return again very soon. The first time we came to McKoys we were looking for a place to eat late at night, so we were only given the late night menu. Our server was extremely friendly and gave us some recommendations for the best food items. We went with the pulled pork and chicken wings to share. The pulled pork was really good and our server even gave us a side of the famous mac and cheese even though it was past the time they usually serve it. The mac and cheese was the best I have ever eaten! The only item I was not a huge fan of was the chicken wings, but that is probably because I am from Buffalo and can be a bit of a chicken wing snob (wish they were slightly crispier).

The second visit we ordered the ribs (YUMMY) but decided to try the green beans as our side along with the mac and cheese. To be fair I am not a fan of green beans, but due to all of the hoopla we decided to try them and HOLY DELICIOUSNESS were they scrumptious. So the takeaway would be to definitely order the ribs, pork, green beans and mac and cheese.

My favorite part of this place is the very cozy bar atmosphere that create an enjoyable way to watch a sporting event. Also, everyone that has waited on us has been extremely friendly and helpful. We will be back to McKoys VERY SOON."}
{"text":"I wasn't crazy about this place. I visited it upon recommendation at the airport and seeing it have 4 stars on Yelp. The menu looked great, there are a ton of options. However most of the food ended up being dry and looked better than it tasted. I ordered \"Living the Dream\" which is four different meats and two sides. The only meat that wasn't dry was the pulled pork, and it was average at best. I usually lick my plate clean and just couldn't get through the rest of the plate because of how dry it was. The staff was all polite and sweet, bringing me up from 2 stars to 3. I just thought the food was pretty subpar."}
{"text":"The Friday lunch special is Fried Chicken, Mighty damn good fried chicken. At Only (with ONLY being capitalized and highlighted on the paper menu) $7.95 with two sides, I thought this was a steal. 

When I got back to work though, there was only one breast. Had I known, I would have just paid the extra $2 for two breasts. 7.95 for one breast, is not a steal - I actually feel like I was stolen from. No one likes only one breast! 

The chicken though, is very good and I mean VERY. Not greasy, very moist, and excellent crispy batter. Let me put it to you this way, I usually don't like fried chicken breast, even from the ever so famous coop. Mckoys breast, is wow. 

The mac n cheese Never disappoints and mashed potatoes are quite tasty and whipped nicely.

All in all, a loyal customer now I am."}
{"text":"My first visit here as I live in Chicago.  This place has the BEST wings I have ever had!!  The wings are smoked then grilled.  The sauces were outstanding!!   I'm happy I do not live in the area because I would be eating here a couple of times a week."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and the food was really good. I've driven by it a few times and always wondered but never went inside. Some colleagues of mine were in town and requested BBQ so I suggested we give this place a try. It was a pleasant surprise I got the pulled BBQ plate, with collards and fried okra. Let me say, these were the best fried okra and collard greens I had ever had. The pork could have used a bit more flavor, or a different sauce offering. But otherwise it was really enjoyable."}
{"text":"Q was very good moist, tinder, hint off smoke. 2 sauces vinegar base & red both good. The winner here is pork was good good 3 ways, naked' vinegar & red. Most BBQ joints Cheap on the sides Not McKoy's the side where as good or almost better than the pork. Service on point, even got a honey or two and that is Southern Q at it's best."}
{"text":"We hit a winner, thanks to first the guy at the front desk at La Quinta, who gave us a list of nearby restaurants with a bar, and then Yelpers for giving this place a thumbs up. 
We were looking for good local bbq after we flew in from CA, and got awesome service from a server who knew her menu and made great recommendations, strong drinks, delicious food, and great atmosphere. 
We ate on the deck to avoid the frigid a/c, since it was a perfect warm evening. I loved my mac and cheese, and the garlicky green beans. The pulled pork was as good as advertised, and the service was beyond compare. A fun first night in NC."}
{"text":"I drive by this place all the time because it's on my way to Costco and on one of my alternate routes to/from work.  I often wondered about some of the places along my way on Old Pineville Rd like McCoy's.   After reading some of the other reviews on Yelp and also getting a flyer on my door at home, I decided it was definitely time to check it out.

McCoy's is a relatively small place but they make use of every inch of space with plenty of tables even if they might be a little close together.  There is also a bar with about 10-12 seats, TVs scattered around and a few video games back in the corner.  They also have a covered patio out front for additional seating.

There is a very extensive menu for such a small place - everything from sandwiches, salads, to steaks, ribs and barbecue.

I ordered the pork barbecue plate with collards and suateed mushrooms.  In about 10 minutes the meal was out.  The pork stands on its own which is hard to find at a barbecue place in Charlotte.  You don't need any sauce on McCoy's pork 'cue.  It's very moist, tender and flavorful and probably the best barbecue I've had in Charlotte for a long time.  Yes, It's better than Mac's IMO...and cheaper.   I will say that I tried both the sauces, an eastern NC and a western NC style sauce and I wasn't really impressed with either of them  which is fine because like I said, the meat is fine by itself.  Who needs sauce!

For sides, the mushrooms were great and the collards were good also.  They came with a homemade pepper vinegar rather than the standard Texas Pete stuff which was a nice touch!  

Service-wise is where I think they can improve on.  The hostess didn't really greet me.  She just showed up when I entered the place and sat me at a table without really saying anything.  My server kind of started out the same way but got better as I sat there and did come to check up on me and refill my drink.

Overall, McCoy's is great and I think I just found my new favorite BBQ joint in Charlotte."}

{"text":"My husband and I, along with our teenage son, really enjoyed McKoy's.  The 3 of us were really hungry, so split the sample appetizer platter along with LTD (Living the Dream) dinner amongst the 3 of us.  We had the Mac and Cheese and Potato Salad for our sides.  My son ate the Mac and Cheese and loved it.  My husband ate most of the potato salad and liked it, but did add a little mustard.  All of the meats were delicious.  The ribs from the LTD dinner and the wings from the app plate were my favorites.  The pot roast was truly yummy too.  If I'm ever back in Charlotte, I would definitely look McKoy's up, and I will likely have a rib dinner.

We were full enough , but not stuffed, so when our fantastic waitress mentioned deep fried cheesecake with ice cream, we decided to split an order.  Really amazing!  Think deep fried ice cream meets sopapilla's - only with cheesecake.  1 order split 3 ways was the perfect dessert for the 3 of us.

We went about 7 on a Monday eve in July.  There was just a short wait.  Don't expect a quiet ambience .  We didn't think it would be, so we were fine with the noise from the other diners and from the bar.  Lots and lots of TV's.

We thought the prices were reasonable.  Or tab before tax and tip was $65.  Considering the quality and volume of food, that seemed reasonable to us.  Certainly not a bargain, but worth it for really excellent BBQ."}
{"text":"It is most definately a good thing when you arrive at the restaurant and have to park across the road. I was expecting good, and had greatness. 

Cassy, my waitress pointed me towards the ribs, and I was not dissapointed. They have both tomato based and Vinegar based sauce, and both were excellent. However, you don't need them, as the smoke ring went all the way to the bone, which the ribs fell right off. 

Finally, I had saved room for desert, and the family recipe coconut pie was excellent. Save room for this to top off you dinner."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best BBQ places in the US. I travel a lot for work and since BBQ is a guilty pleasure of mine, I make it a point to stop by the local hot spots. 

McKoy's menu offers a variety of options but not an over whelming amount that makes your head spin. My advice is to start with a small appetizer if you plan on going big with an entree because the portions are large. I started with the Good Ole Boy Queso Dip. It is large enough for two to share, but one could easily take it down. The go to entree for your first time should be the LTD (Living the Dream). It comes with good sized portions of smoked BBQ chicken, pit smoked pot roast, St. Louis ribs and BBQ pork. It also includes your choice of two sides. The Mac and cheese is definitely good enough to get as an entree if you don't eat meat and the beans are a perfect complement. Although the BBQ sauces are rich in flavor, the meats are smoked and seasoned with so much taste that it is not needed. 

Long story long, if you don't take my word for it, the collection of pictures of country music stars at the entrance speaks for it self."}
{"text":"I come here for one thing and one thing only! Wings ! Wings! and more Wings. The wings here are impeccable, they are smoked to perfection i have yet to find wings that taste quite like the ones at Mckoy's. One day im going to come in here and actually try other things on the menu besides the wings but they are so freaking good i cant help it, i heard great things about the fried cheesecake so maybe next time ill try that and see whats all the hype about!"}
