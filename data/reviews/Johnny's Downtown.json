{"text":"Disappointed!  Come every couple years when visiting Cleveland!  Service terrible!  Very slow with no one there.  Order bottle wine only to pour all glasses after the fist ourselves.  Food not as good as in the past.  Think twice before spending the $ here."}
{"text":"Best steak in Cleveland.  Always great service and the piano bar is a great place to hangout for a drink.  My favorite place to eat in Cleveland"}
{"text":"executive staff is completely rude. Saw the OWNER yelling at a server who was just making small talk with customers.  Then those same customers left because of the OWNERS lack of tact, discipline, respest and just because he appeared to   to be completely wasted!! I will never go back to Johnnys again."}
{"text":"This was always one of my favorite downtown restaurants.   I haven't gone in over 15 years and had been looking forward to a pleasurable, relaxing birthday dinner.  But NO,  we got the rudest, unfriendly, uncaring waiter and the food lack the pizazz I so fondly remember.  This was an expensive disappointment.  Don't go!"}
{"text":"Love the food and music but the bartenders cannot make a decent Cosmo to save their soul. It's not that hard to listen and make a drink as ordered. Also the don't take Discover card. What?  What else can I say except I expect better based on their prices. I gave them 2 chances to get the drink right. Just had one last night at PBS and the bartender was barely legal."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. It's so warm and cozy. They have really nice wines, the service is top notch. I had an amazing watercress salad once. The lamb is also really good. I once went to a party downstairs in the private room and we were very well taken care of."}
{"text":"First visit on a Friday with spouse and couple-guests.  

As other reviewers have mentioned... old-school, classic, stuffy, etc... yep.

The food was solid (I had the potato-crusted Grouper) and most others had steak of some sort.  No surprises on the salads or sides... (potato and asparagus?  Why yes, we do have those and would be delighted to include them on just about everything.)

I was a bit (pleasantly) surprised to see the inside so empty on a Friday early-evening, as it meant our table could enjoy conversation without being rushed toward the door.  That alone is worth the extra dollar or two per dish.

Johnny's is a good spot, just don't go into this looking for something innovative or trendy.  Sometimes, that's just perfect."}
{"text":"The pork chop here was amazing. It was pretty quiet the night I went there but it was very hip and cool place to be. There was a piano player hitting some awesome notes and the food and presentation were spectacular. Deserts were awesome too."}
{"text":"Patio Week 2011
Fancy restaurant with very cool old bar. Have a piano player serenading the bar who is absolutely fantastic. Really adds to the old school atmosphere.
For our first courses we both had the clam chowder which was very good. We chose the filet and seafood risotto for our entrees. The filet was one of the best steaks I have ever had. We tried the apple and chocolate cake for out desserts neither of which were anything to write home about. . . If anything, check out Johnny's for the bar and the piano man. You will be blown away!"}
{"text":"I was nervous to eat here. I really was. The more recent reviews had me nervous. But The Husband made reservations based on The Ritz's recommendations. So we did. Yum. Yum. Yum. The ambiance is lovely. The maitre'd took my coat and we were seated promptly and politely. Our server seemed very overwhelmed and busy but was so polite and was very courteous and honest about her recommendations which we really appreciated. We ordered some shrimp cocktail (wowza! Sauce! Love it!) And escargot. The entrees were mouth watering. All cooked to perfection. We both ordered meat (filet for myself, veal for husband) We were even the last ones there and server was still polite and not rushing us. . .  A really great meal from start to finish. I would go back in a heart beat. :)"}
{"text":"Wow, I can't believe the reviews; they don't get the restaurant or history and don't mention the best appetizers. This place has the best veal in the Midwest and the average waitress or waiters has been working 20 years at the restaurants. 
If you have a clue about Cleveland;  you will notice celebrates, high end business men and the mafia crowd, all enjoying the best meal in Cleveland. Drinks are strong and they have an amazing wine list.  
I go solo to watch a sports event but always end up talking to a politician or the likes."}
{"text":"Attended Johnny's Downtown, and I can't wait to go back.  The wait staff was right on - very attentive.  The appetizers were excellent which consisted of soft -shell crab, duck, and scallop.I can't choose which appetizer I enjoyed better as each item was the best I have ever had.   I chose a caesar salad and for my entree, grouper.  I was quite impressed with the  grouper portion, and the side of au-gratin potatoes...again, best ever.  The meal was complete after a refreshing strawberry short cake and leche' creme brulee...delish!  To top off the party..the entertainment - piano man was top notch,  - could have listened for hours."}
{"text":"My wife and I eat here every time we are in Cleveland. love the piano bar. The steaks are fantastic  and the Italian dishes are authentic. We love our daughter Danielle for bringing us here"}
{"text":"I can't review the food because I didn't stay. Went last night in the evening for dinner. We asked to sit outside. The gentlemen sat us down without menus and said \"enjoy\". It was a bit confusing as to why he would not have left us menus so we waited maybe 3-5 minutes. The outside server came out and didn't acknowledge us. He spoke to the only two other tables out there and went back inside. I went inside and found him to ask for menus and said no one had greeted us. He was a bit abrupt and cut me off and said \"let me track them down for you.\" What does that even mean? Track down menus? Or our server? Was he our server? No explanation or apology. 

He got the food menus and asks if we would like anything to drink. I opened the menu and said I needed to looks at the wine list (thinking it may be in the same menu) and after opening realized it was a food menu only. He proceeded to say, there were items I wouldn't find on there and gave us the food specials. That was fine, but I had asked about drinks? We asked for a drink menu and he said, \"sure\" and got it, dropped it on the table and said he would give us a few minutes. 

It was a weird experience, very uncomofrtable and he was not friendly or inviting at all. The place was not even busy, we were third table outside--the other two tables had already either eaten or were just getting drinks. Inside was very slow. We decided to go elsewhere. Restaurant looked nice, and it was a beautiful night to sit outside but I would never recommend or try again. 

Get it together, Johnny's."}
{"text":"We started off with a flat diet soda. Then, we waited a bit for water to replace the soda. 

For appetizers, we had four giant shrimp for $4.25 each, and mussels. Both dishes were great. 

The waiter didn't clear the appetizer dishes quickly. We looked at them for awhile and watched flies appear. 

My water was always low - it was not promptly filled. 

Uncomfortable outdoor chairs - I'm thin but a heavier person might have issues, plus, bird shit on the chair. 

For dinner, my husband had the Italian feast - pasta, seafood, marinara sauce. He said it was a three star dish because of the amount of seafood. But I tasted the sauce and thought of dishwater. 

My dinner was the arugula salad, which was ok, and the mozarella marinara, which was cold. The waiter was slow to take it back to the kitchen. 

While waiting for my hot cheese, my water ran out again. 

Then, when the bill came, it still had the flat diet soda on it that we returned at the beginning. 

All that for $100 and 8% tax and the obligatory tip even though service was slow. Much better food around town than this. At much better prices and with better service. 

We won't be back."}
{"text":"I took my wife there on Monday,May 20, for our 25th anniversary.Classy place,good view of downtown and a blocks walk from the casino.Very friendly,personable and professional staff. Our waitress has been there for 41 years and knew all of their foods and drinks intimately and made our dining experience fun. Thank you Ginny. The food was the best  either of us has had in Cleveland,bar none, and we have been to the best  restaurants the city has to offer. Never a bad meal here,the chefs are the best in Cleveland. Have a meal here and you will be thinking about it tomorrow. Price wise not bad considering what you get. We spent $150 and $5 for parking and walked away full and happy...many times out at other places I have spent $120 and $10-$20 for parking and was not happy with the food or service. Give  Johnnys a try you won't regret it."}
{"text":"I came here Friday night before heading to Playhouse Square for a show. We (there were three of us) went at 530p and didn't have a reservation, but were seated right away. Our server inquired if we had any time restraints and we informed him of our show at 730p. He was attentive and quick with our drinks and food. Everything on the menu sounded delicious it was difficult to decide. We order the stuffed calamari, which was tasty. It was my first time having anything other than traditional calamari so I am unsure how it might compare to other restaurants, but I enjoyed it. It came with three pieces so enough to share. I had the potato crusted grouper, which came with green beans and scalloped potatoes and a house salad. The grouper had a unique favor that melted in my mouth. The others in my party had the Italian feast (tons of seafood- shrimp, scallops, mussels, and lobster over pasta) and the lobster and meat in a puff pastry.  There were no complaints with any of our meals or our service! As an added bonus, the restaurant had someone playing the piano and near the end of our meal we were confused when we heard the Notre Dame fight song being played. A few minutes later the Notre Dame basketball team (I had just watched them beat WSU in the Sweet 16 at the Q on Thursday night) their entourage walked passed us and were seated in the front section near the window."}
{"text":"The food at Johnny's has gotten way, way better over the last few years.  You absolutely cannot go wrong with the Filet Au Poive.  Perfectly seasoned, delicious.  One of my fave meals in Cleveland.  Fantastic wine list as well.  I always prefer to sit in the bar area when the the piano man plays.  Classy and classic experience."}
{"text":"i hate writing a bad review but i have too because it was that bad....food fly in my wine+undercooked filet+server not happy to work there after 9pm+does not accept discover credit card= johnnys steakhouse...had to ask for manager to make sure his aware of all issues and seemed was clueless about all issues that occurred during my dinner and did NOT care....yelpers be aware.. enjoy you dinner at you own risk...."}
{"text":"We had an excellent meal and fun evening at Johnny's Downtown last Saturday night. They were very helpful and worked in our party of 12 with ease. Maitre De, wait staff and wine steward were friendly, helpful, professional and attentive. The Arugula salad with scallops and brie was terrific, as was the short ribs with garlic risotto. I liked the stuffed calamari although the hot antipasto was a disappointment. All in all, I'd give the food an A- and the wine list a solid A. A tad pricey but the goods were pretty good. The piano bar was nice and romantic and the patio street scene was active and interesting. Who knew Cleveland is cool and fun?"}
{"text":"Very good. Enjoyed the steak, it was a special and not on the menu. Server was very good and took my friends food allergies very seriously when making recommendations. Thought the steak array would have be a little more extensive but was quite limited."}
{"text":"This restaurant has impressed me both times I've been lucky enough to dine here.

As you walk in you are greeted with the feeling of an old-school steakhouse.  The dark wood, and traditional decor set the stage for a perfect date night.  

The service has always been impeccable.  Most recently the guy and I went out to celebrate our recent successes.  We shared the hot antipasti appetizer to start - it was wonderful.  The shrimp and mushrooms came in a bubbling pot of delicious white wine, butter and herbs, and the zucchini and mozzarella served with marinara were simply wonderful.

Each of us ordered a steak for dinner, he ordered the special - a bone in ribeye with onion fritte, and I had the filet minion char-grilled which was served with portabello.  The steaks were enormous - we each ate only half.  They were well cooked, and truly wonderful, however we both thought the sauces were a bit heavy/salty (each steak had a different sauce) and in the future we would ask for it served on the side.  The wine also left a bit to be desired, nothing was \"wrong\" with our glasses, but they did not really have anything to our taste of big bold wines (which was surprising at a steakhouse).  

The key lime pie was a sweet treat at the end - we thought it was pretty delicious.  I would skip the chocolate decadent dessert in the future unless you are truly a chocolate lover... it was a bit like eating a slab of fudge.

Overall a great experience - I was surprised to read the other reviews.  Perhaps the key is going on a weekday (both of my experiences were on slower nights, and we definitely had excellent service)"}
{"text":"Johnny's is a great joint to get a cocktail after a long day. Music is provided by the handsome and talented Mike Petrone. If you're lucky, Cleveland Bob might be in house to serenade you. (Note to Yelper

The Service here is great and the ladies behind the bar are superior. The only food I've noshed on thus far was an arugula salad where the arugula was so fresh I about died. Pair that with brie and some roasted red peppers and the result was oh so good! 

Great atmosphere, excellent people watching, good music, and nice drinks. What more could you ask for? 

I'll be heading here for NYE for dinner and dancing. Stay tuned for an update Yelpers."}
{"text":"Worst wait staff I have ever encountered. Do not ever go there or you might have a plate jabbed into your back followed by the comment\" Get out if my way\". Or gave the supposed manager, who you requested to talk to, push you forcefully out the door, spewing obsentities at you, and shove you on to the pavement outside. Nice place. Real Classy. For one of the supposedly finest establishments in Cleveland it surely dissppointed....especially compared to Chez Francois in Vermilion, which I had visited 4 days earlier. Skip this place and find a Michael Simon restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Lovely weather, good company - the perfect evening to dine al fresco in scenic Downtown Cleveland. On a warm early-summer evening when the windows are open and the piano music drifts out from inside, Johnny's patio is the place to be. 

We started with the flatbread which, while more like a skinny pizza than a flatbread, was delicious. 

The entree menu offers something for (most) everyone - veal, pork, seafood, and pasta. I went with the homemade gnocchi, and it was quite good. My dining companions had similar sentiments about their angel hair pasta and entree-salad. 

Don't come here if you are in a hurry, however - service was somewhat slow. There was a notable delay between our appetizer and our entrees. However! I've determined this is likely because the salad course (each entree comes with a salad of mixed greens, blue cheese, walnuts, and vinaigrette) was forgotten. So, while it was supposed to go appetizer - salad - entree, it instead went appetizer - notable wait - entree. Not a good substitution, in my opinion."}
{"text":"I went to Johnny's when visiting Cleveland.  The ambiance was quaint and romantic.  There was a piano player in the dining area, too--very enjoyable.

I ordered the potato-crusted grouper.  It was moist and flakey, but the potato crust was just a little too heavy for my liking.  I also tasted the house made gnocchi.  The menu notes that it is homemade, but I just wasn't feeling the love.  The taste and texture was in line with something that's been mass-produced.  

Overall, the setting, service, and music is great!  The food is ok, but it's definitely not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"Went here for some desert.  Was a mature crowd and left after we were done.  This place is a bit old school which I do enjoy.  I think the night I was there, there was not that many people."}
{"text":"Loved our dinner!  We took advantage of Downtown Cleveland Restaurant Week and ate at Johnny's Downtown for the first time.  The deal for Restaurant Week allows you to order an appetizer, an entree and a dessert from a preset menu for $40 a person.  It was very hard to choose since all the options sounded delicious!  I started with an Italian Salad as did my husband and our friend.  Another friend had the fried risotto cake.  For the entree, I had the Osso Buco as did one of our friends, my husband had a walleye dish and our other friend had the veal. Everyone agreed the all the entrees were wonderful!  The dessert choices were tiramisu or bread pudding and both were fantastic!  The service was also top notch!  And there was a piano player which added to the already classy atmosphere.  

Do yourself a favor and visit Johnny's Downtown during Restaurant Week which runs through February 27th!  If you can't make it there before the week ends, the restaurant is certainly worth a trip any time."}
{"text":"Enjoyable dining experience, but nothing to write home about.
Well actually, the fried mozzarella was very good.  The food was rich but not really the flavor I was looking for.
Outside patio dining was quite nice."}
{"text":"I'm going to start my review by being honest - I haven't been to Johnny's since I left Cleveland in 2006.  I hope it hasn't gone downhill as one reviewer suggested, as, honestly, it is one place I still think about since I moved to San Diego. 

In the several times I ate there, the sauteed calamari was wonderful.  My friends, family, and I always ordered veal, so perhaps that is their specialty, but the only veal dish I found less than satisfying was the breaded veal, but I didn't order that for myself. :-)  Is the menu innovative?  No.  But Johnny's and Mallorca are the two places I would seek out if I were to come back to visit.  Cleveland has lots of great restaurants, but so many have changed since I left.  Trendy restaurants come and go.  Johnny's is one that is still there.  Coincidence?"}
{"text":"Well the service was good. I love the old NYC midtown decor, it's a relatively all space but wasn't full when we came so it was ok. The food...very very good. Buttery halibut which I rather not so heavy... The apps,drinks,and remainder of the dinner was perfect!  The potatoe crusted grouper dish however... Five star...prefect as it could be!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't impressed with Johnny's at all. We ordered a fish entree and the Penne with Bolognese Sauce. The fish was cooked great and had a yummy lemony butter sauce, but the vegetable and potato on the side weird weird. Really dry and sparse, like they had been made in the morning and then sat out all day. 
I often find that a limp and lifeless side dish can totally ruin a meal for me.

Sidebar: One of the only things that annoys me more is when you have to order the side dish separately. Why do they do that? It's weird. 

The service was really lacking too. It wasn't busy at all and our waiter was soooooo slow. I had to ask for refills and hunt him down for a check. 

I think it's safe for all establishments downtown to assume that people eating there during lunch have to get back to work. So nice quick service is the way to go."}
{"text":"Not bad. But CLE restaurants have surpassed Johnnys. Won't return. Support the the hard-working locals that stay current. It. Helps everyone"}
{"text":"Ehhhhhh....not great. I'm not from around here so I rely heavily on Yelp for suggestions. I'm going to be honest....disappointed. 

Sunday at 6pm we came in and sat at the bar. We worried we were too casual so we opted for the bar. We fit in with casual people watching the Cavs game. We expected a bit more fine dining, but did not receive it. The bartenders friends were at the bar yelling and cursing at the tv. Kind of weird, but ok. Apparently the bartender and the girl had some kind of fight a week or so earlier because they were hugging over the bar apologizing. Still...whatever. I'll eat here. 

We ordered a bottle of good Cabernet. I was not disappointed in the wine list at all! The menu o was expecting a bit more seafood for a place known for seafood. We inquired on the market price for lobster, it was the average price for a lobster. But the girl didn't seemed enthused to sell. So I asked about the specials. She looked it up and read the specials. She didn't make them sound appetizing. 

My husband is a bit turned off at this point by the service and the hostess chewing gum like her life depends on it. But I still attempt to make it better. I order French onion soup; My all time favorite soup! It comes out looking unappetizing because if the lack of cheese on it. Let's be honest....that's why we all love onion soup. The taste was good though. 

We decide this place isn't for us at all and start yelping other places. I ask the bartender if she can bottle our wine for us to take because we can't finish it. She looks very annoyed by the request. It gets worse when my husband asks if either he or she could pour the rest of the glass back in. I get her not wanting to do it , but he offered to do it just in case. Instead she grabs his glass and our $150 bottle of wine and stomps to the back. This annoys me right away. You don't take someone's open bottle in the back where you can't see it. For all I know....she hates us so much she is spitting in it. My husband says something and the host runs back to tell her we aren't happy.  She comes back and tries to ask us, \"well, what are you guys up to tonight?\" Ummmm...are you kidding me?! She hasn't cared about us all night...all of a sudden. 

Overall...skip this place. There are a ton of other places nearby."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends for Patio Week. Great selections for the $30 three course meal. For starters, my friend ordered the tomato & mozzarella salad, and all 3 of us ordered their clam chowder.  Although I didn't get the salad, the presentation was nice and my friend said it tasted fresh. The chowder was not watery but perfect chunky. It had potatoes and good amount of clam. For our entrees, 2 of us ordered the seafood risotto and bacon wrapped steak. The seafood risotto had scallops, mussels, and jumbo shrimp which were cooked perfectly and it tasted delicious. The steak was also cooked perfectly and the meat was tender. For the dish, it also came with buttermilk potatoes which also tasted great. For dessert, we got the chocolate torte with raspberry glaze and the banana foster. The foster you can't really complain unless you don't like bananas. The torte was very rich and heavy. I couldn't finish it because of all the food I had before. 

Along with our food, we also got some drinks. My friend ordered a dirty martini and I had a Belvedere tonic. Both were made well and strong. The ambiance of the restaurant is very romantic and intimate. It's a nice and classy place to bring a date. The outside patio is spacious but because the day we went was a bit chilly, we sat inside. The regular prices are pretty much the same as if you were to go to places like XO and Blue Pointe Grill."}
{"text":"First time at Johnny's...don't think any of our party will ever return. Other than what looked like a very nice, historic building and nice decor, can't come up with too many positives. I really don't understand so many positive comments about the staff, the service and the extra special attention they are known for. 

Went for Downtown Cleveland Restaurant Patio Week, and specified that when calling for reservations. Ignored at the door by 2 servers who were standing there hearing our conversation about whether we needed to go inside to find a host stand or if someone greeted you outside for patio dining. Went inside, reservation confirmed, led completely through the restaurant to a very nice table near the front windows, seated, then learned that the Patio Week menu was only served outside. Made the reverse trip through the restaurant to our table outside. 

3-course prix fixe menu sounded great. Among our group we had all 3 appetizers offered, 2 of the 3 entrees and all 3 desserts. 

Asked how the heirloom tomato salad would be prepared....or server did not know, said the kitchen prepares it differently each time. May be sliced, may be wedges, but would be served with bocconcini mozzarella, olive oil, balsamic reduction, herbs, etc. Turned out to be caprese style with 2 slices of flavorless, medium sized grocery store tomatoes and 2 slices of a fresh mozzarella log. Said to the server \"these certainly don't LOOK like heirloom tomatoes\"....he said, \"they don't to me either\" and walked away. (Wife's mixed greens was, again, straight out of the grocery store bag; not much flavor in the soup of the day either. 

Bacon Wrapped Filet looked and smelled great. Ordered medium rare....presented medium well (I chose to keep it rather than hold up the rest of the table). Said to the server \" does this look medium rare to you? He\"....he said \"no, that looks really overdone\". The au gratin potatoes were so salty that I could not eat them, and I really do like well salted starch dishes. (Server had told us that Johnnys is \"know for\" its veal and the bananas foster....the veal picatta portions were very generous, but was pretty heavily breaded and rather dry.) 

We had all 3 of the deserts offered. The flourless chocolate torte really was good. A friend had the apple cake which he said was very good as well. The bananas foster... the desert that Johnnys is known for... near the worst that we have ever had. Severely undercooked... the sauce was thin, runny and underdeveloped and the bananas were almost raw. 

We were never offered the customer survey and sweepstakes entry form that should be part of Patio Week. We were never offered any apology or any accommodation for the several obvious problems with our meal. The owner spent most of the evening pacing the sidewalk and smoking just across the rail from the \"nonsmoking end of the patio\". 

Quite a disappointment to us, having recently located to the area and anxious to find the wonder downtown food scene that Cleveland is supposed to be know for. Johnnys was NOT the place for us to start!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant last month while on a business trip, and needless to say I think it's really gone downhill.

I found a large centipede in my salad.
It was so gross, I threw up a little in my mouth.

I will never, ever, ever come back to this establishment ever again.

I mean really, how does a centipede even get in my salad?  How is that possible?  I don't even think centipedes eat salad.

Grossness.
The end."}
{"text":"Just got back from dinner at Johnny's.  Used to like this place but what Italian restaurant has no pasta on menu for New Years Eve.  When I called for reservation they said they would have some regular items on menu but they just had a pre fixed menu for the night.  Filet was undercooked (raw) had to send back.  Food was  not up to par and  very overpriced for what you got.  They should have stuck to their original menu.  Used to be my go to while in Cleveland but not any more."}
{"text":"Great food, nice service, a little expensive for what you get... Dark, cozy atmosphere, suggestive of a full-bodied red wine and forces you to stay for desert... This is a once-in-a-while kind of place though, because it is somewhat old-school and serious."}
{"text":"Lovely, this is one of the nicest establishments I have eaten at. I don't think we have old classic restaurants like Johnny's Downtown. I came with 7 people and we were definitely the youngest folks in the place until a family with kids came. 

I had the petit filet  with crab gratin, Medium rare 6 oz filet cooked perfectly. We all shared the pork stuffed banana peppers and the fig, goat cheese crostini.  

My only complaint is that service seemed to take awhile. Some of my friends were late in  coming, but it seemed that the slowed down  service was intentional."}
{"text":"Live piano music on Thursdays, good ambiance, and large wine list - great!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice.  The first time it was good.  The second time was TERRIBLE.  There were six of us for dinner.  I was the only person at the table that ordered a salad.  My ceaser salad was brown and slimey the lettuce was rotten. Gross. I let the waiter know that it was very bad and uneatable.  The other five people at the table got salads as well yet none of them ordered one.  The fish dish I ordered was dry and very fishy smelling and did not taste right.  I was very disappointed.  When the check came we got charged for five house salads even though no one at thte table ordered one and hey guess what my ceaser salad was on the check as well.... So needless to say I'm not a happy camper..."}
{"text":"I would give this establishment a big ZERO and would not recommend my worst enemy eat dinner here!  The waiter was horrible, he was running from table to table and never finishing a conversation!! Or filling water glasses or bring the bread that he promised 20 minutes ago.  We were there for 2 hours and only had the opportunity to order appetizers and salads.  When we asked about time for a meal, the waiter said that the kitchen was REALLY busy and it would take awhile.  

Meanwhile the place was almost empty.  We sat on the nonsmoking side of the patio, when we discussed the cigar smoking patron to the manager he quickly told me he was a regular and they made NO effort to move him.  The waiter even gave him an ashtray! Upon leaving the OWNER was smoking a cigarette with the cigar smoking patron. 

If you are looking for a bad experience, horrible service and WAY overpriced food (my tomato salad had HUGE slices of onion) than this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Our large group (10) went to Johnny's to celebrate a birthday. It was a very enjoyable time. Needless to say, a party of ten can be a challenge for any restaurant, but the staff at Johnny's couldn't have done it better. Very friendly maître d', attentive bartender and a great waiter made our evening memorable.  The stuffed pepper appetizer was delicious and the filet was just excellent.  I would definitely return- particularly with a larger group. Thanks Johnny's!"}
{"text":"Went here for restaurant week in Cleveland. The portions were substantial and filling. I got the stewed meat dish and it was pretty good. The dessert was really but too rich."}
{"text":"The hubs surprised me with a night out for Sweetest Day back in October.  We decided to go to Johnny's bc neither of us had ever been there.  We do frequent Johnny's Little Bar in the back.  Side note, Johnny's Little Bar has THE BEST CHEESEBURGERS in the CLE!  

For a Saturday night, they were not all that busy (very surprising).  I loved all the old detailing on the walls and in the entry way.  Our food was delicious and pricey but with the high prices.  I would recommend Johnny's Downtown for those special nights out with your significant other or if you want to impress out of town guests or that special someone."}
{"text":"Went there for a birthday lunch.  Whatever happened to making someone want to come back went by the wayside.  The grouper entre was actually very good.  The onion soup was very salty and I guess I'm just not a smelly old sock kinda cheese guy.  The feel good moment opportunity of getting dessert on the house was exhausted by paying 8 bucks for tiny piece of Key Lime.  When the waiter (whom I paid wel) gave the old standby response that there wasn't a manager around to discuss, we left fairly disappointed.  This is CLE not NYC.  I'm really not one to complain but I feel old time establishments need to be reminded that they need to continue working on their game and make their customers want to tell others about their experience!  Otherwise there are plenty of other spots to visit."}
{"text":"Johnny's Downtown is ridiculous. I'd always heard that it was the kind of place that was filled with young women on the arms of very old, wealthy men and that proved to be true when a friend and I stopped in recently on a Friday night.

We sat at the bar around 10pm. The dining room was clearing out at this point but the bar area was still relatively full, although there were plenty of empty seats at the bar.

My friend and I sat at the bar. The bartender was SO inappropriate and rude. It was very odd. His attitude problem resulted in us only ordering one glass of wine each and an appetizer, then we booked it.

The restaurant itself was lovely, but when I went to the restroom I was shocked. The restrooms are in the basement and the carpet leading downstairs were disgusting. Totally filthy! The bathroom itself was disgusting as well. For a place that charges $40+ for a steak, having such a gross restroom is inexcusable. 

To make matters worse, I noticed a few days later that they processed my credit card incorrectly. I was charged more than I had authorized. When I called and pointed out the mistake they neither offered to correct the problem or send me some type of compensation. 

In conclusion, this place is not worth your time or money. There are SO many other fantastic restaurants to check out in Downtown Cleveland instead."}
{"text":"the place is old-school and upscale with a great bar area. some of the staff was a bit uptight or unfriendly on my last visit, but they can do whatever they want cus the food is just incredible. pricey, tho."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on recommendation of a friend. Fabulous lunch salads and very reasonably priced!  Yummy bread too"}
{"text":"What great service we had from Jessica. Was like dining with family. Had stuffed peppers for appetizers very good. We had Italian feast and a filet for dinner. Both were awesome. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Johnny's Downtown bar was the most fun I've had out in a long time! 

I'm a new mom, and pregnant again, so my usual bed time is about 8:30pm. I'm a total home-body these days and usually it takes a lot to get me to stay up past 10pm. Well, we had visitors from out of state, and wanted to show them a good time downtown. I had help planning the nights festivities from my husbands cousin who has lived in Cleveland her whole life and often comes downtown for a nice night out.

We planned for this to be our last stop of the night. We ended up here a bit earlier than we expected in our bar-hopping because there was a horribly drunk girl at the Nauti Mermaid (but I digress). We went straight for the bar, able to snag a few seats, and a few more after a while as people there to eat started leaving. It was a Friday night, and they had a piano player/singer for entertainment, and boy was he entertaining! The piano player was not stuffy at ALL and let others sing and play while he was on his break, he also encouraged a sing-a-long atmosphere that made requesting your favorite song all the more enjoyable!

The bar tenders were young, and nice. They knew what they were doing and seemed to juggle the bar patrons (and all the yelling - I mean signing) well. I cant speak to the drinks that were made, although everyone I was with enjoyed their beverages. They tended to make the drinks on the strong side. My Shirley Temple was great. Also great: the creme brule! It was a great texture and flavor, and they crusted the sugar top right before it came out, so it was nice and warm while the custard was cold. Yum!

The worst part of the evening was having to call it a night - Thanks Johnny's!"}
{"text":"Limited menu, but they NAIL each item. 

Went with the Halibut and Filet. I have never had Halibut THAT amazing! Bravo!

The Filet will impress the most snobiest of steak gurus"}
{"text":"Nothing offered for vegetarians, chef worked with us somewhat. The (entitled) regulars at the bar had the tv turned up to watch the news and even when the piano player started it took them some time to turn it down (after we asked.) It was a little obnoxious and not relaxing. 
Food and service were fine, nothing great. If your older, this place is for you."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I've been here three times now and my last visit was exceptional! I've had the short ribs, filet mignon, and the veal medallions in my past three visits and each time the food is amazingly delicious, savory, and filling!

Also Johnny's has the BEST tiramisu I've had in Cleveland. Absolutely delicious! 

The atmosphere is beautiful. The noise level is surprisingly not as loud as it would seem, and the decor and lighting are just perfect. They have beautiful paintings on the walls as you dine which really adds to the ambiance of the restaurant. 

The bar area is beautiful as well and has a nice old feel to it which really has an alluring charm. 

Service is definitely great too, but the food for me is what makes this place excellent!"}
{"text":"Love this place! If you are old school or classy-addict , then this place is definitely for you  check this place for sure if you are in town! Good for companies, romantic date or just hanging in the bar. Please NO flip-flops! It's a classy and elegant place! 
In addition to all, there is live music  
Enjoy 
Ps. Lobster and see food tower are the best in town"}
{"text":"The host was nice enough. He sat us down with no menu. I guess that's how they do it. The waiter came over and was very friendly, we liked him. He gave us a wine list. We ordered wine and Pepsi for my husband. Then came the menus after the drinks came. We had no idea the prices were so outrages but we stayed, it took us a long time to pick out something reasonable. We both got the angel hair pasta with the veal meatballs. I thought they were delicious . They melt in your mouth! The pasta was so fresh I loved it. The thing that kind of bothered me was the fact that the wait staff all stand together and kind of stare at the customers the whole time. I was facing them so it was pretty uncomfortable. But at least they were there when you needed them. 
The place was recommended by the hotel clerk. If we had any idea about how pricey it is, we would not have gone there."}
{"text":"Total class at this establishment! Excellent food, attentive service, wonderful wine list and a wood paneled vibe. Always have experienced a friendly atmosphere in this clearly upscale environment. Great place!"}
{"text":"Again, I was shocked that this place was rated so low! I just adore this place! The bf and I went for our anniversary last night and it was my first time! 
We shared a bottle of champagne; they had a great selection!!! 
We started with the calamari, which was spectacular! The sauce is sooooo unique but completely delicious! I had the potato crusted grouper. It was simply outstanding!!!!! Cooked to perfection and served with a delicious sauce. Wow. My bf had the lamb and he raved about it! (I don't eat red meat so I can't weigh in here..) 
The service was extremely attentive, never letting our water or champagne get low, never letting a dirty dish sit too long. 
I applaud this place for being an old staple of Cleveland and continuing in being outstanding!!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed, underwhelmed and mediocre. Johnny's Downtown seemed robotic in operation and lacked the character and soul to separate itself from some of the other nearby food palaces. 

After debating a few eateries participating in Cleveland's Restaurant Week, we decided on Johnny's on West 6th for a late Friday night dinner. 

A maître d' to check your coat and assign customers to a white linen clothed table was the first order of business upon entering Johnny's. An old timer at the piano played cover songs throughout the night. 

An almost drone-like waitress with limited personality to take your drink order was next. No smile, no drink menu. They have wine and a full bar to make all the basics though as we were informed. I opted for the house Pinot Noir. Poor, poor Merlot. After that Sideways movie with Paul Giamatti, ordering Merlot seems like a culinary faux pas. My accomplice, not nearly the drinker as myself opted for the Earl Gray tea.

A few short moments after our drinks arrived, the near machine-like waitress was back to take our order. We opted for the 4 course menu. I started with the Baked Risotto with garlic sausage, duck confit, spinach and gruyere cheese. It sounded phenomenal, right? How could one go wrong with any of the above ingredients? And it was passable, but this risotto was dry, bland and lacked the knockout punch I was expecting. Next, I had the French Onion Soup, which I was later informed they were out of. How? It's onion, gruyere cheese, bread and stock. Oh well, Butternut Squash Soup sounded like a decent alternative. As with the first course though, it was bland. I was beginning to see the trend here. For the third course, I chose the Roasted Lamb rack en croute with port reduction. It was served with a butter knife, not nearly the piece of cutlery required to slice through the medium rare meat. Again, not impressed and pretty much underwhelmed. The lamb was cooked to a proper temperature, but it lacked any noticeable seasoning. The port reduction was over caramelized and bordering upon burnt. For dessert, a slice of Chocolate Mousse Cake, which tasted like it came out of the freezer earlier on in the day. 

On surface value, everything went according to plan. Both the front and back of the house appeared to run like a well oiled machine. Between each course, we were courteously asked about our meal. Nothing went unnoticed. Except for any sort of personality. The food was as bland as the servers and ambiance of the restaurant itself. A lot of the patrons appeared to be wealthy older professionals and their trophy wives. Perhaps this is what appeals to the old money in this town? Perhaps this is where the current 20-somethings humping the night away in the nearby Warehouse District clubs eventually come to die? Perhaps their cigarette and Four Loco destroyed palettes can't detect properly seasoned food? Who knows. 

For someone who has experienced a wide array of eateries in this town, I do know there are a lot other places in this city that are more exciting and inventive. Personality wise, Johnny's is the culinary equivalent to James Earl Jones. Stoic, monotone and boring."}
{"text":"Nothing special. We were going to go to Taza next door but they had closed early and we didn't feel like walking far for dinner so came here instead. My husband ordered some pasta in marinara sauce with some seafood in it, wasn't that good. Sauce was really bland and just not tasty. The cesar salad was nothing special. Their berry and nut salad that I had was good- just a typical berry salad. I ordered the gnocchi and while it was tastier than my husband's dish, it had way too much salt in it. We live around the corner from this place and won't be back."}
{"text":"Well what to say about Johnny's Downtown? The staff was nice and    accommodating. Decent old-school and classic atmosphere. But that's about it. 

Based on what we ordered, I personally think the meal was overpriced and underwhelming. The food itself was average but mostly lacking good flavor. I had roasted lamb rack, baked risotto with duck confit, and apple cake. The only saving grace was probably the bread made in-house. Certainly not a place for a date. More like family hangout where you bring your grandpa or grandma. I left this place unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Johnny's used to be the special occasion restaurant.  WOW, what happened?! The evening started out with the host, arguing that our reservation was for the night before, but he would seat us anyway (in the half empty dining room). The very new waiter tried his best, but was not well trained. And the food, the SAD plates of food....a measly veal chop that was butterflied first and then pounded, the potato crusted grouper used to be a flaky, potato weaved basket of beauty, is now a lame potato breaded average piece of fish, and who serves lamb chops paper thin...and breaded?! Did I mention that every plate has the same side of green beans and au gratin potatoes? And my dessert was half frozen. This place is FAR from special. Save your money and go ANYWHERE else."}
{"text":"Was taken here on a business lunch, and was \"greeted\" by a cold-natured hostess.  We were evidently bothering  he waiter, as he was visibly upset helping us with our standard requests of water and wine list. 

The food arrived all at once, soup for me (heavy on the salt) and the salad looked good, but didn't have time to finish when my main course arrived and began to get cold. Nothing like seafood fettuccine in a cream sauce like-warm. 

All-in-all stereotypical heartwarming Cleveland attitude.  I probably will set foot in that location again."}
{"text":"Mediocre performance at best.  Poor drinks, food overcooked, not nearly a Mortons @ Mortons prices.  Unimpressive.  They tried to recover and it helped, but wouldn't go again....unapologetically."}
{"text":"Our waiter was the highlight, as he was very friendly. The food was good, but you would expect great for the price.  And... one of our cocktails was served with a fly in it.

The waiter quickly replaced it, but you would think they might go a step further by having a manager apologize or comping the drink - neither happened. 

My summary - over priced and inattentive. You can find better."}
{"text":"Surprised and a bit bummed to see how far this place has fallen.  Really unfortunate.  The food ranged from okay to bad, the service was very slow, the prices were far too high for the quality, and they somehow had no water glasses even though the place was mostly empty.  Hopefully they'll turn this place around, but avoid unless they do."}
{"text":"This used to be the one of the best restaurants in Cleveland. I am sad to say not anymore. My husband took me last night for my Birthday dinner. We has a reservation for 6pm. The hostess took us to the bar to be seated. I asked for the dining room-which was empty....she said no because the band was setting up and it would be loud. Conversation over. Our waitress has been there for about 20 plus years. She was less than personable. She pulled my son's plate away from him while he was eating and continued on several occasions to sell us t-shirts.
My steak and lobster in a puff pastry was marginal. The lobster had a very fishy smell...actually it was awful . Our bill was about $200.00 with no drinks or dessert. The atmosphere wait staff and food was a miss. I think this place has seen better days. My birthday dinner was a total flop!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of the - if not the finest restaurant in Cleveland.  Lord knows what happened, but they can't melt cheese or cook a burger without burning it.

Stunningly bad.  Just amazing.

An institution is about to fall.  What a shame."}
{"text":"The calamari appetizer here was one of the best I've ever had.. And I consider myself somewhat of a calamari connoisseur of sorts. (Yes I know that may came off pretentious.. My bad) The lamb chops were outstanding as well as the grouper my girlfriend had ordered. Our waiter was a newbie but did a great job as well.. Very attentive and a nice guy. Overall as notes with the rating, excellent experience and we'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is not great and the service has gone downhill.  If you want a good meal for the same price, walk one block to Blue Point or Osteria. Bottom line...I live downtown and would NEVER recommend Johnny's as you will most likely not have a quality meal."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews that describe Johnny's as old school, geared for the older crowd. Classic entrees, luxuriant decor, piano bar. We go here every year for friend's birthday and we love it. The staff are incredible and my friend's group never makes it easy on them, which irks me a little, but I've been impressed with how professional and accommodating they are. Kitchen is top notch."}
{"text":"A friend from Cleveland told me I had to go. Boy am I glad I listened.  We showed up at 9pm on a Friday night with no reservations and were seated no problem. We had the most amazing waitress and enjoyed a thoroughly delicious meal.  I got the breaded veal chop with arugula and cherry tomatoes with a balsamic reduction - and a side of angel hair past with their famous marinara.  OMG. My moth is watering just thinking of it. So good.  I deducted one star for the decor - a little faded but don't let this deter you. It's really good."}
{"text":"Great appetizer, salad, entree. Loved the atmosphere. Our waiter was young and clearly inexperienced in a fine dining environment, but he did alright. I would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND it and will visit again if we're back in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I've been here twice with my father. He's a regular at Johnny's. during the summer it's great sitting outside to eat. Winters are slower. But nonetheless the food is always great. Top chefs of Cleveland. Never a bad meal. High end."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar with my brother celebrating my birthday. Met Amy and Matt from Annapolis visiting their daughter in Lakewood.

Had the grilled veal chop! Quite possibly the best piece of meat I have ever had! Came with house salad with blue cheese and walnuts, green beans, and scalloped potatoes. Veal was long bone rib chop with shiitake mushrooms and a Demi glase. Will and Lauren were great at the bar. Very delicious manhattans and Irish Coffee."}
{"text":"It's depressing to see the demise of this once excellent restaurant.  The service is terrible, and the food is mediocre.  I had a boring tuna nicoise salad which was really bland.  The tuna tasted like plastic.  My husband had some dried out gnocchi that was allegedly homemade.  There is something wrong with the owner, who was cursing and yelling at the front of the restaurant.  Johnny's can't compete with the multitude of great new restaurants around town.  Ick."}
{"text":"If you want to mix and mingle with the old boys get your Rat Pack inspired self to Johhny's.

THE SERVICE:  Old School.  Everything is taken care of.  Could it be that the head of my party was the Sinatra of the local Pack?  Possibly.  It's likely that he received extra extra special attention in a place known for extra special attention.  
NB: Be very specific when you order your cocktail.  I ordered a 21 year old Balvenie with 1/2 shot of water.  The waitress kept asking me if I wanted soda.  Eeeek no.  When it came, it was served to me in a tumbler filled with ICE.  What horror.  Honestly, who serves single malts with soda or ice?  To the waitress' credit, when she saw the look of consternation on my face, she whisked it away and brought me a proper glass of Balvenie with a water back for me to add myself.

THE ATMOSPHERE:  Old boy, Rat Pack elegant.  Dark wood.  Low lighting.  Waiters in full length aprons.  Old chums in fedoras gathering to banter and sing.  Delightful.

THE FOOD:  This is a good place to take your parents.  And I mean that in the best possible way.  The food is upscale, good, but not challenging.  Mum and dad will enjoy their meal thoroughly without wondering how exactly to navigate the presentation.   I had the halibut piccatta with a lobster potato hash.  The halibut was perfectly seared on the outside, if a little dry.  The lobster was succulent, but the potatoes were woefully undercooked.  My salad of warm greens, dried cherries, walnuts and goat cheese with a balsamic vinagrette was rich and complex, if a little heavy handed with the garlic and balsamic.  I was told that the lamb chops are divine.

I'll be looking at the moon, but I'll be seeing Johnny's."}
{"text":"We used to think of Johnny's as a special dinner destination. our recent dinner was definitely disappointing.   The filet in peppercorn sauce was delicious, our salmon was overcooked and fishy. We asked for the salmon (which was the \"fish special\" ) to be cooked medium rare, we like our salmon juicy. It was dry and fishy ( frozen tasting )as was the couscous t was served on. We'd like to believe that Johnny's could gain its \"special\" rating again, not so sure.
The bill came and our fishy salmon dinner was over $40... I think for that price the fish could have been edible."}
{"text":"So my coworker ordered a steak medium rare. It came out pretty raw. Almost straight from fridge. So he sent it back to be cooked a little more. Again, same problem and he sends it back. This time, they brought out a new piece and it was finally cooked correctly but he was full by then. I have never been to a restaurant where they had to fix their \"fix.\" That's pretty bad. Not only that, they didn't offer to comp his steak. 

I ordered the cod and I have no recollection of eating it because I was so shocked at my coworker's experience. I know I ate it though, I just can't review the dish itself."}
{"text":"Bad Bad Bad with a menu stuck in the 80's and terribly overpriced for what we got. The bread was like something from Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill. My ribeye with gorgonzola butter was really tough (I had to ask the waiter for a sharp steak knife in order to saw into it), oversalted, and had almost a 4 inch square of fat attached to it. OK, maybe it was only 3 inches square. But it was a huge blob which you really don't expect from a \"fancy\" place. The gorgonzola butter was curdled and salty, whereas I was expecting something velvety and more gorgonzola-y. The spinach was greasy and oversalted. The best part of my meal was the diced root vegetables, which were a delightful combination of spicy ones and salty ones, perfectly fried ungreasy golden brown cubes crunchy on the outside, and lucious on the inside. They were perfection. They were less greasy than the spinach. My mother in law had the shrimp scampi special wrapped in prosciutto with asparagus and risotto. The scampi (there were only 4, fortunately) were too salty for her, and she is a salt-a-holic. The risotto was tasty but a gummy mess. It was like the risotto which I try to make at home, but never succeed at, LOL! The food wasn't actually \"bad\" (though my mother in law thought it was, I think because it was such a letdown), it was more like food I would make at home, except I certainly wouldn't charge $36 per entree for it and I would not oversalt it and I would certainly buy a better cut of meat!

The waitstaff were nice and considerate. I sort of felt sorry for them, having to serve such bad food.

Anyway, we won't be gonig back especially with such an old school surf and turf sort of menu. I'm glad I went though to satisfy my curiousity. We've been going to Crop Bistro, which we adore, and Johnny's always had a decent crowd sitting outside. Must be the place to go for drinks and raw bar, if you are into that old school, pseudo Wall Street blast from the past sort of thing. I did enough of that in the 80's so I'm over it.

True foodies should avoid this place. However, actually, it might be super fun to do an 80's night and dress up 80's and have cocktails and the raw bar."}
{"text":"Great burgers and sandwiches. The beer selection is large and they have good choices. The wait is never bad and everyone is very inviting and friendly."}
{"text":"Food is good, service was great, it's. Cleveland institution, pricey but that is to be expected. That being said, skip Johnnys and just go to Little Bar and get a burger."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY.
I ate at Johnny's with a group of 10 people while we were in Downtown Cleveland for a conference. The waiter offered us stuffed peppers as appetizers for individual or for the table that was not on the menu. The price was not ever mentioned. I ordered the peppers for the table. We were served a platter of 10 veil stuffed peppers. When I got my bill I was amazed to find a charge of $75 for the appetizer I had ordered. I asked if the price was correct and was told it was. I excused myself from the table and spoke to the manger outside of the room we were in. I told him I felt the charge was excessive. He would not budge or help me in any way. I guess I walked into a trap. 
I feel they were deceptive as the price was never revealed to me until it was to late. The food is only mediocre and I advise everyone to try the Blue Point Grill. It has excellent seafood,  service is spectacular and prices are very reasonable unlike Johnny's."}
