{"text":"I come here for Gryfe's bagels which they sell. The bagels are light and airy and delicious. I also buy the eggplant salad and cream cheese to go along with the bagels. They also have good halva. It's kept us happy for years.   They have a good selection of European products, salads, spreads, fish, fruit and vegetables."}
{"text":"The best hand cut lox in the city. It's not a Resturant nor a grab n go. It's a family grocery store with lovely homemade traditional Jewish delicacies. Gryfe bagels of many types baked on premises."}
{"text":"They have excellent bagels here. If you come on a Saturday you will usually get fresh hot bagels!  The cream cheese and egg salad are both very delicious.  I like coming here to to get lunch!"}
{"text":"Despite its pedestrian appearance, Sunrise Kosher  Foods is an excellent destination for old fashion and first rate deli/appetizer. You know the place deserves high praise when a friend  who's family traces their roots back to Morocco compliments their Matbucha! I stood there when this individual said to the cook: You've brought the taste of Morocco to Canada. That is just one example of their varied offering. I am particularly fond of fish. Getting rather tired of tuna salad. So I would highly recommend their smoked whitefish salad. Absolutely terrific, primarily because the food preparer uses a minimal amount of mayo. Therefore the predominant flavour is the beautifully smoked fish not  the dressing. Their Moroccan fish balls are also fantastic. If you live in our hood, known as The Manor, or are just passing through between Sunday morning and Friday afternoon, their hours of operation, make it a point to stop in."}
{"text":"I wanted a bagel and I had two choices: either go to Bagel Plus or Sunrise Foods. I chose Sunrise because their sign listed a magical name: Gryfe's.  Gryfe's bagels are the best bagel you can buy in this city: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/gryfes-bagel-bakery-toronto. You can buy one or a dozen, and dress them up with various toppings.   I had a hankering for lox. I chose cream cheese and lox ($3.29) which is cheaper than the one with lox bits in the cream cheese ($3.99). Being a deli, they serve other foods like salads, homemade dumplings, blinis, herring in cream or wine sauce and even schmaltz!  Sunrise is part grocery store and you can also find imported jams, canned fruit and vegetables that you don't see elsewhere.  But to enjoy your meal, you can't eat there because they have no tables. Sunrise is more of a grab-and-go kind of a place."}
{"text":"This place has been around for a long time.  I used to avoid it like the plague for reasons which I won't get into.  I decided to give them another try after almost 10+ years.  WHAT AN IMPROVEMENT!!!!  They have bagels which are fairly light and airy (don't expect the stone-type ones which sit in your stomach like a rock), a good selection of smoked salmon/fish and, to my surprise, a variety of different brands of jarred sour cherries - from Europe.  Not the friendliest bunch working there -- but the prices are reasonable, the European imports (mostly from Eastern Europe) quite substantial.  Their veg. section looked a tad sad, though."}
