{"text":"Tasty food, decent price, outside seating like many other restaurants on state street. I enjoyed my meal here and my girlfriend absolutely adored hers, service was alright too."}
{"text":"I should have know while entering Buraka, and not smelling the overwhelming smell of Berbere and coffee that I should have left.  Ethiopian food is my favorite, and my wife is from Ethiopia.  I am no stranger to the food, but this food tasted like Indian food 100%.  It has to be the worst Ethiopian food I have ever eaten, and I question if the patrons ever tasted real Ethiopian food again with these reviews?   We wanted to love this food so badly, but I was so disappointed and unable to finish our family tray."}
{"text":"I really love Buraka.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Madison.  I am vegan, so I have not tried many of the options on the menu, but I have not found their food bland at all.  My favorites are the misirwot and the lentil samoosas.  The service has always been great when I have eaten here (at least 30 times).  A couple reviewers have commented that an Ethiopian restaurant should not have rice, but as a vegan, I appreciate that they do so I can actually eat here.  Who cares if they offer something that is not traditionally Ethiopian?  Just don't order it if you don't want it."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick business lunch. I had Ethiopian years ago.  Lived in DC for a few years but unfortunately never got to try the wonderful Ethiopian there, given a lot of Ethiopians in the area... when I go back I\"m definitely going to try to hit it up, if its anything like Buraka.  Had the coconut chicken curry and dorowat.  Pretty cheap, like $9 for a combo.  Decent food.  Not too hot or spicy.  Service was passable though if you're in a hurry I wouldn't eat outside for lunch (since they have to come up from the basement).  Wasn't as spicy or as flavorful as I had hoped, but it was a solid lunch, and I'll be back.    The bread isn't as bad as I had read here on yelp.  A little tangy.  Fluffy.  Nice to use with the meat/stews.  My friend I was with recommended getting the dishes with the rice and getting a side of the bread, that way you have both worlds."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place and was very underwhelmed. We ordered an array of dishes, none of which were standouts and none of which tasted much like authentic East African food. All the meals came with the kind of boring side salad you'd get at a family-style Italian place. When the meals came out, everything had less flavor and spice than it should have. Not only that, the portions were relatively small and quite expensive.   The patio area is a great space but swamped with bugs (not really their fault but did make the experience less enjoyable). Overall, wanted to like this place but there was not much to like."}
{"text":"If people didn't rave about Buraka so much (I was taken here immediately when I first moved to Madison - like twice), I think I would have liked it better.  You basically have a choice of a number of stews - vegetarian or meat - served on an african bread, which is really like a sour pancake.  It's good, it's just didn't live up to the hype for me.  It also seemed a bit pricey, but I guess they've cornered the market on african food in Madison, so they can get away with it.    Bland-ish, and it makes me feel left out to be around a bunch of people obviously enjoying what is an especially good meal.  Sort of a bummer."}
{"text":"I, like many other Madisonians, was very excited for Buraka's return. However, it was an extremely disappointing experience on so many levels. The food was alright  (hence the 1 star), but the service was horrendous and just sort of awkward. My SO and I  came for dinner on Friday while it was somewhat busy, but I don't think that's a good enough excuse for the poor service we received. When we were seated, we accidentally sat at the wrong table (same size as the one our waiter intended for us, except it has a few more chairs), and instead of being polite about it, our waiter was pushy and awkward about asking us to sit a different table. It took a while for our server to actually come and ask us what we wanted after we got our menus, but when we ordered, the drinks came with pretty decent timing, which is cool I guess. We also ordered an appetizer and our entrees, which we waited FOREVER to get, and our waiter didn't check on us at all in the meantime, except to bring us our salads. Then our entrees (which weren't even hot) eventually came out....BEFORE our appetizer. Our server didn't apologize about it or acknowledge it at all, nor did he apologize for the wait once. He didn't stop by and ask is if we needed anything afterwards. In fact, our waiter didn't stop by once after that. We sat at our table with empty drink glasses and empty plates for quite a while, and then we noticed our waiter leave the building for the night without saying a word to us, asking us if we wanted anything else, passing us onto someone else, or giving us our bill. I figured he must have put someone else in charge of us and waited around for 20 to 30 minutes more and no one brought our bill. Finally, we went up to the bar and told the bartender we still needed to pay, and he was actually able to help us pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it was a little to late. I've worked in customer service pretty much my whole life, and I totally understand that sometimes you get busier than expected or you end up short staffed, or even both of these things happen in the same day. It was super rude and awkward for our waiter to not apologize or even acknowledge it once though (not to mention, leaving the building without a single word). I can't say I'd be excited to come back at this point."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to check out Buraka since forever but as as a service industry dude I hadn't found the time.  Y'all know how it is.  Long story (short story) short they are now in my backyard and I couldn't be more pleased.  Excellent food friendly enthusiastic server (servers?) and decent cheap tap selection ($4.50!) made the experience I had tonight with two of my favorite people one I will repeat and recommend.  The three of us sat outside on their killer patio and our servers M and M took great care of us.  They took turns checking on us and we joked with M that perhaps they were one shapeshifting sever.  Just as M disappeared through the kitchen door the other M (?) emerged from the dining room Scooby Doo style.  Yuks all around.  Wrapping up,  good people with good humor serving tasty samosas and rich stews.  Did I mention $4.50 taps?  Had some."}
{"text":"Well, really 2-1/2 stars.  I'm an adventurer and I'll try any ethnic dish at least once.  But this place just doesn't move me at all.  It feels like a diner in a basement - which it is.  But an East African diner with very intriguing artwork on the walls which helped pass the time in those uncomfortable chairs.  Mine wobbled a bit too.  If these stews are Ethiopian, so be it.  Not at all like the  Ethiopian food I've had in D.C.  I was sold on the \"newness\" of East African food!  Of course Ethiopia is in east Africa too.....  So we had a small variety of stews that I assume came out of big pots.  Some were tasty, others not.  My friend enjoyed his, but he recommended this place.  When I finished, the hot one had me burping for some time after....as did the relatively high price- to- value relationship I'd just experienced."}
{"text":"I've had a lot better Ethiopian than I was served at Buraka. There is a decent percentage of veg options, which I appreciate, but the menu overall isn't very broad. They also don't have sampler platters for individuals, except for a two-entree combination option which costs more than one entree for approximately the same amount of food.    I ordered a combination of the misir wot and the black beans, both described as spicy. Wary due to other Yelp reviews, I emphasized to the server that I like my food spicy, and she assured me that the two dishes are indeed quite spicy. They were not. More significantly, they simply weren't very flavorful. Nor was the injera, usually a highlight of my Ethiopian restaurant experiences.  Halfway through the meal the server offered hot sauce, which helped,but I ultimately expect more flavor in the food itself.   The ambiance is nice, and they have patio dining, but I'd give this restaurant a definite pass in the future."}
{"text":"I love his chicken alicha! I tried some alicha in Rosalind's, one of the restaurants in LA's Little Ethiopia row, but they're so different than Buraka's. I remember Buraka's alicha is red in color and has tomato taste. The one I ate in Rosalind's actually has more spices (and less red in color) than Buraka's. I don't know which version is more authentic, but I don't care. I still love Buraka's chicken alicha + green (spicy) chilli sauce + yogurt + rice! Yum!"}
{"text":"Order the Dorowot. Ask for it with ingera.  Your tastebuds will be happy!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan meals with an incredible variety. very reasonably priced"}
{"text":"Good food, but terrible service. I went in for lunch today, and it wasn't too crowded, but it took 10 minutes for me to get a server. Then when my order finally was taken, I waited half an hour for the food. While waiting, I overhead the server arguing with the kitchen, because another customer had called in a to go order, and had also been waiting half an hour. On top of it all, the server never once checked in during the meal, and by the time I was finished, I waited another ten minutes for the bill. At this point, I was so fed up that I went to the bar to pay the tab, and the server was nowhere to be seen in the building. I loved the old Buraka, and still love the food, but I will not be dining in again."}
{"text":"Every single thing to eat at Buraka is delicious - with the exception of the little salad that they give before every meal.  Tibs, Baris, any of the spicy bits . . . so good.  And the lentil salad at lunch time is divine!  I don't live in Madison anymore, but if I did, I would still be eating at Buraka weekly - and hitting up the lunch cart!"}
{"text":"We were all sad when Jolly Bob's closed down but the replacement is much welcomed. Buraka has given the building a much needed renovation. It's now much more spacious and inviting. The outdoor seating is newly landscaped and if it wasn't so hot out today we would have eaten there. I can't wait to come back on a cool evening for some food and drinks.   Like other reviews the service is not quite there yet. A bit herky-jerky. A food runner brought us someone else's food. Not a huge deal. Our apps took quite a while to get to us as well. The duck tenders were \"Ok\" the sauce definitely helped prop up this dish. Our main courses were very tasty. I've read a couple reviews saying the food has \"Ragu\" sauce...definitely not. All fresh made food here. The Samosas may be the only hand made in town. Delicious.   The lunch menu has so much to offer I opted to get a combination plate. I wish I could remember the names of the food but I'm blanking. My buddy got the Injeru with his meal...which was spectacular...made my rice seem very boring.   I got a Caipirinha with my meal. It was ok. Not the best i've had not the worst but it did the trick.   Between this place and Jamerica...eat at Buraka. The food is much much much better. Hopefully they work the kinks out service-wise. It wasn't very busy and there seemed to be some confusion among staff."}
{"text":"We have had Ethiopian food in a variety of cities: Boston, Providence, NYC, DC, and Salt Lake City.  We were very hungry and really wanted to like the food here but it was easily the worst meal Ethiopian or otherwise we have had in the past couple years eating out. We ordered a veggie, a chicken, and a beef dish - all tasted like a combination of Chef Bogardee with Tabasco sauce."}
{"text":"So I went back and I don't like it quite as much. It's still good, but not as good. I think they might have stopped serving their lentil side dish with every meal, which makes me sad, cause that was yummy. It's a little bland-er than I remember, but still a cute place with good food."}
{"text":"Food is bland and a bit dry. Sauces could be heavier and better flavored. Notably, tibs were very mild and other dishes were barely warm. Plate came with salad (?!) and Italian dressing. Random sour cream. Good Ethiopian food should be hot and seep into the injera to make a delicious bite... not the case here."}
{"text":"Okay, so first of all, I'm not from Madison so my opinion of what Ethiopian food should taste like is skewed. But I'm not going to base this review solely on that. I'm going to write this review because the food my sister and I had here the other night was absolutely terrible. We were hoping for a great late-night bite after spending the day on State Street, and this place looked interesting...  I wish we had just perused the menu and walked out.  I ordered the vegetarian peanut stew, and I tasted no peanuts in the \"stew\" whatsoever. The injera was disgusting and didn't soak up any of the sauce. My sister commented that it felt like she might be eating skin. I took my last bite and about gagged. Sis had the chicken peanut stew, curious- I tasted her sauce to see if it had any hint of peanut... none. We were both so disappointed in coming here, we walked out pretty let-down and depressed that we actually spent money on that slop. I've had better food served to me from a high-school cafeteria, and believe me, that is saying something.  Do yourself a favor and skip eating here, save your first experience with Ethiopian food for a visit to a bigger city. I hate to dis Madison because I think a lot of restaurants here do their best, but Buraka is simply serving the cheapest and most ill-prepared food and getting away with it because you Madisonians have nothing to compare it to!   Sorry if this sounded condescending or rude but I really don't want anybody else to leave with a bad taste in their mouth."}
{"text":"stopped in on a whim, when looking for a new restaurant to try.  the place was clean and nicely decorated.  the service was speedy.  and the food - amazing.  the samoosa appetizer was quite delicious (had one each of beef and lentil) and the dorowot entree left me wanting more.  the drink selection is nice, though i confess i didn't indulge this time... guess it's just one more reason to go back!"}
{"text":"Disappointing is the word that comes to mind when describing Buraka.  We first ordered the samoons (excuse spelling errors) and they came to us with a warm outside and cold inside, a sure indication of them not being fresh and most likely frozen beforehand. Then we ordered the combination platter with each a side salad. The salad was measly at best. Very little lettuce and only a tomato on top. The food came out and was also partially cold.  Also, this is so far from authentic. They gave you silverware. Also, platters should be served on a large tray, almost like a pizza tray, with injera covering the whole thing. The chosen dishes then on top. NOT in a bowl.   I've had Ethiopian food in both NYC and SF, both times phenomenal and authentic. I would never ever bring someone here for their first Ethiopian food. They would get the wrong impression. I know that if Buraka was my first Ethiopian restaurant I would not list Ethiopian food as one of my favorite foods.   Avoid unless you are desperate."}
{"text":"Went last night and I was underwhelmed.    We ordered a family platter and we were collectively surprised by the small size of the platter and the limited portions for each $13 entree.  At first we thought something was wrong like we got the sampler or something.  The food was good overall, but we were hoping for better.  We got our food quickly which was great, but I don't recall seeing our server until we asked for the check.  So empty water glasses and drinks ordered that didn't show up.  Overall it wasn't the experience we were so hoping for and I felt it was expensive for what we got.  No other Ethiopian places around unfortunately, I'll go to others when we travel out of town and stop by their food truck but probably not go back to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and a nice tap beer selection. Everything we had to eat was delicious! The yucca fries were so good, as was the chicken peanut stew with injera. It all paired well with a Karben4 Lady Luck. They were out of a few menu items and seemed a little under staffed, but we still received very good service and were not disappointed with the food that was available. Excited to see this place grow!"}
{"text":"Valentine's Night dinner--WIN!   Started off with the veggie samoosa and a mango drink. The samoosa was warm, crispy, and the filling was spicy and delicious. The accompanying dip had the perfect sweet-spice pairing. I love mangos and the sweet drink was a nice contrast to all the spicy food.  I ordered a combo veggie dinner--the veggie peanut stew and the tomato-based rich stew. I got them both on rice with a side of injera. Both excellent--spicy and delicious and very good on the rice. I think I'm too white for the spongey injera although I enjoyed trying a bit of it. The side salad was nice--nothing too impressive but not a gross iceberg no-flavor mess either.  Note that the food isn't served authentic Ethiopian style (on big platters on the injera with everyone sharing and eating with their hands), although as I mention again, I'm pretty white and it was really good.  At first, I was worried we might have slow service as there was one guy who was running the whole show and the bar, but he did a great job."}
{"text":"I don't know if it's real Ethiopian or not, but I find it pleasant enough to go back on occasion. It's an interesting little restaurant down in a dark basement and they make a good chai (very balanced spicy flavor, not too sweet). Their menu options are few, but the food is alright -- The injera bread is probably one of the most unique options there, though some of the stews feel like a repeat of Husnu's and Kabul on State St. and their chicken can be a bit on the dry side. Prices are reasonable during lunchtime as they have half-portion menu options then, but dinner can be quite pricey."}
{"text":"Was good food. 4 vegan options. Went there after soundcheck. 5 stars for being across from the co-op. Asked if we wanted a dollop of sour cream on top of our food, we said no, then we talked about how interesting that was, being asked about the dollop. I had never been asked that before. Was a good show regardless."}
{"text":"Not quite what I expected, but  not bad either. My experience of Ethiopian cuisine has been more communal, ordering a sampling of different stews and sharing with others. I actually prefer it that way because you get to try more. At Buraka, you order your own plate like you do at most establishments, and I guess this is my one complaint. I have had better (in Chicago - check out Ethiopian Diamond on N. Broadway if you get the chance), but this certainly was not bad at all. I enjoyed my dish... it had a nice heat to it, and most everyone else at the table enjoyed their meals as well. I would definitely go back. The service here was adequate. On one hand, everyone got everything they needed and we felt comfortable, not rushed whatsoever. If you are expecting a bubbly server who kisses your ass and charms you, this is not the place. If you are not high-maintenance, you will do fine with the service here."}
{"text":"I want to love it. Really, I want to love it sooo badly. But the truth is: go to San Francisco or Washington D.C. and get it there. As my (very white) Grandma would say: \"this is interesting.\" By which I mean, there are some ...flavors....and ...spices... but nothing quite pulls together.  At least the African Nut Stew and Injera are good."}
{"text":"Not quite what I was expecting but still a good experience overall.  First I'd like to say that I've never had Ethiopian food in my life, so I think in my mind I had this image of Indian food mixed with various exotic spices and unknown vegetables, but all in all the food reminds me of midwestern dishes mixed with a variety of spices that I've never tasted.    When we walked in the door there was plenty of seating and the hostess was quickly there to greet us.  The staff was extremely friendly and the waitress came to our table and took our drink orders very rapidly.  Basically, the customer service was extremely responsive and kind.  We all ordered our appetizers and everything arrived faster than I would have expected.  The samosa's were amazing and the drinks were great.  The food followed right after and again, the food was just as good as the apps.  The only thing that I didn't enjoy as much was the ingera.  I like ingera but 2 rolls would be enough.  Adding the meal on top of the ingera made it soggy and did not compliment the meal as much.  All-in-all I would go back.  Nice atmosphere with a good food selection and great staff."}
{"text":"Short story- Okay food, terrible service.  Longer story- Our party of 4 walked in and we were super excited to check out the restaurant. We got seated fairly quickly but then didn't receive any water, or any other form of attention, for about 10 minutes. We had to flag down the waiter in order to have him take our order, but he made it seem like it was a hassle for him. We then waited 45 minutes for our appetizer, despite asking about it multiple times. Just a few minutes after the appetizer was delivered, our entree dishes (which were only okay) arrived. Overall, we were pretty disappointed. Please take this review into consideration to improve your service!"}
{"text":"Food is great try the simosas. The lentil salad is to die for. The service that the owners daughter provides is atrocious. If she is serving I take it to go"}
{"text":"Food was perfect. Service, well lets just say they don't want to bother you with checking in and seeing how you're doing ;) the food was awesome though"}
{"text":"Was so excited to return to Buraka when it opened in the neighborhood.  The food was delicious, but the service was horrendous.  We arrived and it took 15 minutes to be noticed by the server to get menus, then took a long time to order.  We ordered and the apps and my beer took another 20 mins to arrive.  After waiting another 40 minutes for our entrees the server came and told us one of the dishes we ordered was finished.  No apology, no offer to take another drink order while we waited, nothing.  We asked if the new order could be rushed since we had already waited a very long time.  I felt like we could have been in one of those TV shows with hidden cameras, it was that bad.  The dinner finally came another 20 minutes later.  The server never checked in or apologized for the delay in our food.  I would love to come back, but am very hesitant due to the lack of service and long waiting."}
{"text":"Great college restaurant.  Sat outside on State St for a great atmosphere and good, tasty food.  Never had African food before but will certainly try again when I come across another place serving it.  Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Buraka is back now on Willy Street (old Jolly Bob's location) with the same delicious dishes it used to offer at its State Street location. Affordable, fresh, and amazing. They've been open for only a couple of weeks. We arrived today toward the end of the lunch rush and it was still pretty packed. Service may be slow, but the food is absolutely worth it. Vegetarian options like Misirwot highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Madison NEEDS a stellar Ethiopian restaurant, or simply more great African restaurants at all. Buraka's new location on Willy Street is beautiful and sets the scene for success. The interior has beautiful, light, shiny woods and a well stocked bar. The back patio has seating, large and small; minor shady areas. Despite this really awesome setting, Buraka needs to work on consistency and going back to its roots.  My first visit, portions were large, flavors robust, dorowat spicy enough to make my nose run a little, staff knowledgeable and appeared invested. My visits thereafter changed somewhat. Portion are about half, I can easily finish them yet prices remain the same. Spice and flavors are less; tomato more noticeable. I'd like to think they aren't using Ragu as it has been noted but I'll have to check that out next time. Staff have definitely declined; I struggle with needing to ask 3x for the same 1 beer. Buraka is no Alem Ethiopian Village in Milwaukee (drooling...) but Madison will really be in luck if Buraka returns to its former quality."}
{"text":"Just reopened in a new location after a hiatus of over 2 years. Glad to have them back! A friendly staff and delicious hearty stews have made this a Madison staple for over a decade. I highly recommend the dorowat!"}
{"text":"Buraka was the first real \"ethnic\" good I ever tried way back in 2007 when I moved to Madison for college. And I immediately fell in love. And then my heart broke when they were forced to leave the old location.   I've been to the new location once and recently got carry out for my birthday lunch at work.   The dorowat is still just as tasty as ever. Think of it like a spicy chicken stew. Served over injera, a kind of sourdough \"tortilla\" almost, it's perfectly hearty and savory.   I wasn't a huge fan of the fact that the carry out version came with a lentil salad type thing--the raw onions just weren't my standard jam.   So why the 3 stars?   Service sucked. When we dined-in our waiter was very inattentive. After we ate he and several other waiters walked past no fewer than 10 times before another waiter finally cleared our plates. Then the same thing happened when trying to pay the check.   Getting to the new location also kind of sucks and it doesn't have nearly the charm of the old one."}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I have never been blown away by ethiopian food; it's usually messy and difficult and not amazingly super tasty; except at Buraka, where it is amazingly super tasty, and neither messy nor difficult."}
{"text":"The food was so good there was nothing left on the plate. Walked away with a happy belly."}
{"text":"I came in from Chicago visiting a friend that just moved to Madison. Both of us being foodies, we decided to check out this Ethiopian restaurant we heard the locals talking about. So, let me tell you about this Ethiopian food ya'll....it's made with Ragu. YES, Ragu pasta sauce...and it's served with a side of sour cream. Don't believe me? Peek into the kitchen where you will see a full shelf of Ragu pasta sauce. WTF would you need pasta sauce in an Ethiopian restaurant? And who in Ethiopia eats sour cream like that?!! I'm offended right now. Got me over here eating pasta bolognese with a side of injera.  For those of you that enjoy this, I'm sorry that you've never had authentic Ethiopian food and this sets your bar."}
{"text":"No menu is posted outside (wish there was), but we took the plunge and headed downstairs to check it out.  The menu was fun to peruse, and I was pleased because there were several vegetarian options to choose from.  Entrees were served on either rice or ethiopian bread and were moderately sized and served with a side salad.  Several African beers were offered, which were fun to try.  Our waitress was not overly friendly, but attentive enough to be fine with me.  The main room seems to offer a bit more ambiance than the back room, which felt a little lacking in that department.  I'm not sure if it was the overhead lighting or the chairs, which felt a little rec room-like.    BOTTOM LINE:  Fair prices and several veg-friendly options.  I was glad we tried it and it was enjoyable enough for me to recommend."}
{"text":"Really good ethiopian food, and the server was great at explaining different menu items. Food is decently priced, and comes out quickly.  Don't be worried about going down the stairs, it doesn't feel dungeon like at all :) The decor is pretty light and homey; it felt like I stepped into someone's home and they cooked us dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place, love the food.  Unpretentious, consistent, delicious.  find it odd that people complain about the prices or that it isn't \"authentic\".  Go to Qdoba for some \"Mexican\" then, it is right across the street. Sheesh.  Good stuff, out of the ordinary for humdrum Midwestern college-town food on State Street.  Check it out.  Enjoy!   Dorowat, black beans & rice combo is a good way to go."}
{"text":"Great food, I had terrific service eating at the bar on a Friday night. Great drinks. Can't wait to come back for more."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our meal here. The Dorowat and samosa were awesome. This is my new favorite place on Willie Street."}
{"text":"Great food, worst service I've had in any restaurant in years. We weren't given silverware or plates after getting our food served family style and the waiter, although he was hanging out on the other side of the room, hardly came by at all. It really didn't seem like anyone at the front of the restaurant gave a flying f#ck about the diners."}
{"text":"I was a little leery about trying this place on my lunch break after reading the reviews on poor service. I decided to try anyways with a couple co-workers. We decided to get the Yukka fries - very tasty. I ordered the Dorowot with Injera. It was very good - had just the right amount of spice to it. It was served with a lentil side which I was anticipating it to be hot, but it was cold so that threw me off on my first bite. It tasted good. As far as the service, we didn't have any problems at all. The waitress was pretty soft spoken, but she took our orders in a timely manner, checked on us during the meal, and got us our bills right away(and even separated them at our request). It was a very pleasant experience and I look forward to going back to try other appetizers and meals!  I also felt that the portions were just perfect. Full plate of food and I left there very full."}
{"text":"Buraka is decent, but I think I would leave it at just that. They're good at what they do, without ever trying to go above and beyond any expectations. After all, when you're basically the only restaurant within 50 miles that's selling any form of African food, the bar isn't set very high. If you come here because you're craving Ethiopian food, you'll be satisfied. If you come here expecting to be impressed by something new and different, you'll leave wishing you tried something else.   Basically every entree here consists of meat and/or vegetables cooked in a simple sauce, served over injera bread. It doesn't matter much which one you pick. The spices they put in lack any boldness, leaving you with simple, uninspired sauces that do the job but don't wow you in any way. The same can be said of the rest of the ingredients in the dish. Without any variation by way of spices and flavors, most of the dishes end up tasting pretty much the same.  You'll receive several helpings of injera bread, which you won't find anywhere else. It tastes pretty unique - slightly bitter, and very soft and fluffy. You can roll it up like a tortilla or use it for dipping in your food. Problem is, without anything good to combine it with, this bread is rather helpless on its own. The sauces you'll receive to dip it in only serve as a crutch to compensate for overall blandness.  The service and the atmosphere were average, much like everything else in the restaurant. The waiter was tough to find at times but he was friendly and the wait wasn't too long. All in all, Buraka did not disappoint, but it won't impress either. I can't strongly recommend it."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here today. It exceeded my expectations and my memories of its former incarnations. I sat at the bar, and ordered the dorowot, with a side of awaze. The food was delicious, and it was served quickly. The service was great--attentive and personable. I enjoyed catching up with Buraka in its cool new location. I will be back, and I will bring friends."}
{"text":"I really love that they have multiple vegan options.  Relatively reasonably priced for lunch or at their food cart (For a veggie dish, about $4-5 for a half portion or $6-7 for a full portion).  Most of the time I make myself very standard salads for lunch, but sometimes I just CRAVE ethnic food that I can't replicate.  This is where the Buraka food cart comes in.  Hearty, quick, and pretty tasty.  I will be honest, though: I can't particularly attest to the authenticity."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've ever had Ethiopian food, and like my first time, I left feeling full and satisfied.  People really should try Ethiopian food more, because in my very humble but awesome opinion, Ethiopian food is da bomb.   They always have deliciously seasoned meats, with lamb at the head of the pack.  Then on top of that, the meats are accompanied by all kinds of savory sauces that will make your taste buds happy.   Finally, you wrap everything up with the injera, which is like a burito wrap, but much thinner. This gives it a great carb to meat/vegetable ratio, and the injera does a great job of soaking up the different sauces and juices. Also, the injera has a slightly sour taste, which, while off-putting at first, adds a great balance with its acidity into the meal.   And all of this can be had for around $15-18 for dinner, with enough leftovers for another meal, to the tune of some relaxing background African music."}
{"text":"Yep, the service here is slow. BUT your food comes up quickly after you finally get to order. Our servers were also thoughtful: bringing extra plates for the kids, extra napkins when they spilled their water, and suggesting a side of rice when they weren't sure about the injera bread. As for my husband and I, we tried all for vegetarian stews in a family-style platter. Absolutely delicious, and vegan heaven!"}
{"text":"I liked Buraka on State St, and love the new location.  We visited this past Wednesday night and we're seated right away at a table upfront near the bar. Service was attentive and friendly., and willing to share recommendations  that were not necessarily the most expensive thing on the menu. I hate that. We ordered samoosa appetizers along with Dorowat, vegetarian peanut stew and beef tibs family style with injera bread.  Three entrees for 4 people at first seemed like it was not going to be enough, but we left satisfied.  Very glad to have and to keep Ethiopian in Madison.  Strongly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm really happy to see that Buraka is making quite a stir in Madison. Went here on Sunday and the place was moderately busy. We chose to sit at the bar, yet  service was on the slower end. We were immediately greeted by our bartender, yet menus were not handed right away (Restaurant 101). There were an awkward few minutes without menus. After menus, there were a few more minutes for anyone to ask us what we wanted. I made the initiative to say we were ready to order. Placed drink order, appetizer, and entree all at once. I wanted to order the Samosas, but unfortunately they were out of those (sad face). Instead, I got the tostones which came out promptly. The tostones were served with a house made sauce, which is spicy! They were basically ripe, deep fried plantains. For my entree, I got the Sigowot. I picked the white rice as my side and the entree had a mild kick to it. Food was amazing! I love saucy stews and mixing them with white, fluffy rice. My friend got the injera, and the best I can describe that is by saying it's a semi-sour, spongy tortilla. Great for sopping up the spicy sauces. Menu says you get a lettuce salad, but we were given a lentil salad instead. Lentil salad was delicious, but at this point I'm getting the impression that they are running out of ingredients in the kitchen. I'd give food a 4 star and service a 3. They are probably just getting back into the groove of things, so I will definitely be back for more delicious Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"I went here after a recommendation from a friend and I was not let down. I have never eaten any Ethiopian food before, but it was pretty good.   The atmosphere was very nice. It was quiet, not too busy (but also not dead), a little dim and we got a somewhat secluded table. It was very nice for a date.   The food was pretty good. I wasn't too impressed, it seemed a little bland, but then again, I did pick the most basic \"meat and potatoes\" dish. My girlfriend had some sort of yellow curry. She liked it. I think I tried it and it was pretty good, but I am not a huge fan of curry.   The drink selection looked pretty large. They had a full bar. Looks like a fun place to share some meals with some people and have a couple of drinks.  The decor was pretty nice, bathrooms clean. Overall it was a good place and I will probably check it out again sometime. Maybe I will be a little more bold with my food choice this time."}
{"text":"Great place.  I second the earlier recommendation about asking for the hot sauce.  Friendly service and great food - what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try Buraka for lunch one day, only to find that it was semi-authentic. Any place that offers you forks along with your meal at an Ethiopian place, I put into question.  I had the half misirwat, half vegetarian peanut stew. I was definitely filled by the end. The flavors were too mild and too bland. Overall, I'm ranking this a 3 star, bordering on a 2 star \"meh.\""}
{"text":"We came in with a group of 5 for dinner. Service was okay even though it seemed a little busy.   We ordered beef samosas for appetizers and a Buraka Breeze (mango rum and iced tea). The samosas were excellent. Really soft/crispy crust. Just perfectly done. The Buraka Breeze was fairly sweet for my taste. I don't think I would order it again.  We ordered three main dishes to share. Lamb Tibs, Misirwot (Potatoes, Split peas, lentils), and the Dorowot (chicken and carrots in a red sauce). We asked for the Misirwot and Dorowot to be served family style. This was enough food for us. I really enjoyed the mixture of the curries with their injera bread. I was particularly a fan of the Misirwot because the potatoes and curry was a great mix. The tibs had a nice spice to it too. The lamb and the chicken were both quite tender. Really a satisfying meal all around and I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"To my knowledge this is the only Ethiopian restaurant in the Madison area. Fortunately, it is also excellent! The food is delicious and wait times are usually pretty low.   I recommend getting the combo meal, with whatever sounds good to you. I like the lamb and beef stews the best, but everything I've had has been great.   I really like their Injera. It has the perfect amount of tartness, and really complements the stews. If you want a little something more, try the yuca fries - delicious!  Spice levels are medium, but you can ask them to adjust."}
{"text":"I have never had East African or Ethiopian cuisine before. I was hesitant to try Buraka at first, but I was pleasantly surprised.   The Samoosas and the fried plantain appetizers were delicious. Most of the main entrees at Buraka are curry dishes. I tried the Dorowot and the Siga Alicha and both were pretty tasty. The good thing is that for adventurous patrons, there's an option to try a combination of two dishes and do a half-and-half. I highly recommend that.  The service at Buraka is great, so ask for recommendations. You won't be disappointed in their food."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the cart several times and at the actual restaurant a couple of times now. I like getting Ethiopian food in the \"traditional\" serving with a huge plate and you pick things up with the injera. Here they call it \"family style\" and they've made some strange twist to it where the plate is not that big and they LAYER the food with the injera o.O (injera, food, injera, food). Really strange...  I get the impression that the injera here is a bit more sour than others I've tried. The food overall ranges between good and okay.  Also, it's quite a lot more expensive for dinner and I asked if the portions were significantly bigger. They said the portions were a third bigger. Yeah. That didn't happen."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  We got the \"family platter\" where everyone can order a meal and it is served in piles on one large platter with extra injera.  Food takes a little bit of time, so don't come rushed.  Everything was delicious.  We had minchet, chicken coconut curry, a veggie stew, a lamb stew, beef tibs, and ... one more that I can't remember.  Two critiques - the samosas were a little under done, and they were out of their lentil soup, early, on a Friday night.  Despite this I highly recommend this place in the new location on Williamson street."}
{"text":"This is a great place to dine for East African food. The service was very attentive and the food was great (we tried various items on the menu). I almost missed the entrance and went to the Middle Eastern restaurant next door. You have to go down some stairs to get to the restaurant (so don't think you are in the wrong place).   I will definitely come back to Buraka whenever I'm in the area. It's worth the trip if you are visiting Madison."}
{"text":"Buraka gets 5 stars from me for the superior service and care from employees (on top of a lovely atmosphere, and good food and drinks!)   I have been to their new location on at least 3 occasions. Once for food, twice for drinks (both times during the 2016 presidential debates). I have always been met with kind, prompt service. One employee even showed me their (BEAUTIFUL) patio space out back, though it was already closed for the evening.   I have ordered several things off of the menu and it has always been quite good. I really like the dorowot! Bonus, when you sit at the bar they have little bowls of gardettos out for your snacking pleasure. I want to come back soon to try their fish fry, and am beyond excited to come back for a summer afternoon on their patio."}
{"text":"This is the first place I go to whenever I'm in the area. It has a very unique style of food that you won't find too many places. The Ethiopian sour dough bread is a great canvas for the various saucy dishes. You can also ask for a hot pepper sauce on the side, since the dishes are not too spicy. The Jamaican ginger beer (soda) is an interesting drink and very powerful, although it is not for everyone. There is basement (downstairs) indoor seating and outdoor seating along the street. This place also has a food truck nearby in case you do not want to dine at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome food! I get lamb. My other companions get chicken usually. Service is great!  Definitely try it."}
{"text":"They ran out of injera when we came in for dinner. Taste was average. Not authentic enough."}
{"text":"This place is great! And they have an awesome patio!  Food was really good- ordered the beef samosas (delicious!) and a combination dinner of dorowot and coconut chicken curry. Server was very kind and had good recommendations since it was our first time there.  Definitely a cool place to try!"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful evening at Buraka with a friend who was visiting from out of town. Since it was a picture-perfect June evening, we chose to dine on the patio at the rear of the restaurant. It's a lovely garden-like setting under a canopy of trees, although the patio is on a bit of a slope so you need to be mindful about how you position your chairs to accommodate the fact that the patio isn't level. I'm a long-time fan of Buraka, and have enjoyed their food since the days of their basement-level State Street location. The main courses are comprised of things Americans would consider stews to be served with rice or injera, a crepe-like sourdough bread used to scoop up the food. My friend isn't a fan of stews, so he opted to order a couple apps for his main course: the coconut shrimp and the almond-crusted duck tenderloin. I had the begwot, a spicy lamb and carrot dish served with injera. They offer gluten-free injera for a buck-and-a-half up-charge, and that's what I went with. The verdict: The shrimp was fantastic. The appetizer features five good-sized shrimp, and they were delicious. The duck was good, but didn't send me over the moon. The thin medallions of tenderloin were dominated by the almond crust. They were tasty, but a bit over-cooked and dry. Both were served with a damn fine dipping sauce that had a fiery kick. My lamb entree was yummy, and just what I expected--a bit zippy, but not too hot to handle. Entrees are served with a simple, and simply perfect, salad of romaine and tomatoes dressed with a vinaigrette that makes a refreshing counterpoint to the entrees. They seemed to be a bit short-staffed that evening, and after a too-long wait, I went to the bar to get the glass of wine I ordered myself, but no big whoop. I can deal with that. Bottom line: Check this place out. It's worth the visit."}
{"text":"Restaurant is in basement of building, but it was quiet, clean, and brightly colored.  Loved their Chicken Curry and Lamb dish (can't remember name).  Enjoyed the tasty side of lentil salad.  Very small plates for lunch, but delicious, filling food.  Nice level of spice.  Had bottled non-alcoholic ginger beer which was very good.   Lunch partner had the unleavened bread with her entree and this bread looked like a thin, wet pancake (which I would skip.)   Pleasant young waiter.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the city.  I love their vegan/vegetarian dishes, especially the misirwot. The servings are plenty to share, I can rarely finish it on my own.   4 stars because sometimes the service can be spotty. Food is ALWAYS amazing, though."}
{"text":"Amazing food as always but the new location and restaurant is beautiful! Has a great back patio which is perfect for the lovely madison summers. I love everything on the menu but highlights are the peanut stew and the dorowat."}
{"text":"I like what they did with the Old Jolly Bobs. Very nice clean look. The bar is about the same but not so intense like it was at the old place. A few new drink specials and with the booths in the bar area, cosy. The menu is very interesting and you can choose two of the entries on the same plate for fifteen dollars. Waitstaff was well trained and friendly. With all of this I to was underwhelmed  as one other customer said. I was  with a group of six and everyone was happy with what they got except me, and I am not that picky. Both of the meals on my plate was different but tasted exactly the same with an overwhelming salty taste. It probably wasn't salt but thats what my impression was. I would have to give it another try but for now was not impressed. Still like the place and hope it makes a go of it here and maybe can go back in nicer weather to try the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this restaurant for a while and it was worth it.  I ordered the Alicha and my boyfriend ordered the chicken curry, both came with a side salad. Both were delicious and the Injera was yummy as well. My only critique of the food is that it could have used more salt but other than that, sooo good.  I also noticed that they used fresh vegetables and the food was clearly homemade.   Additionally, the atmosphere was very happy and welcoming. The patio was beautiful. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Pricey spot, but if you're craving some yummy samosas or fried plantains, this is the spot!  Came in for happy hour drinks and appetizers, but I could not help myself from ordering more samosas. Only two come per plate per order, so I recommend ordering at least two orders. The spicy beef was my favorite and tasted just like how my mother's friend used to make them in Ethiopia.   Nice high booths, full bar, and back patio seating for larger crowds."}
{"text":"My guess is that not many Wisconsinites have had Ethiopian food very often or ever- and therefore, are not that picky. But sometimes, if you have lived in other states, you just want something that is NOT Midwestern tavern food! The food here is OK to good. The injera is very good - a classic, buckwheat sourdough pancake bread. The main dishes- mostly stews, both meat and vege., are fine, but not very spicy. Real Ethiopian food is SPICY. Ask for the red sauce, it helps. Real Ethiopian food is served on a huge platter on top of the injera bread, with each choice placed around in a circle on the bread. Then everyone eats with their hands, you tear a piece of bread/pancake and scoop up some lamb, or beef or vege stew and pop it in your mouth. You can use a fork here in Madison- or get the food served on rice.  They have a drinks happy hour until 6 pm (maybe only M-F?) - well drinks for $2.  \"but sorry! we are out of tonic.\"  Really? a bar--- out of tonic? Pints were also $2. til 6 pm. The space is in a nice high-ceiling basement room, with warm lighting, well-spaced tables and a quiet vibe -- you feel like you have stepped away from State ST madness. Friendly service. (Please servers, wipe the sauce bottles clean when you get a moment.)"}
{"text":"Yummy food and a nice dining area make this place a winner.  There were four vegetarian main courses to choose from.  One thing that was curious was that they had no appetizers on the menu."}
{"text":"It's alright, for Ethiopian. I grew up outside of NYC and have spent extensive time in DC, which has an enormous Ethiopian population, so I like to pretend I know what Ethiopian food is.  People who've experienced legit Ethiopian before will most likely be wondering why rice is offered on the menu. Come on...it's all about injera.  Dishes were good, but not solid. I thought the doro wat was a bit dry (the chicken, that is), but the mesir wat was quite good. Injera was decent, but I've had better.  So...yeah. Three stars for decent Ethiopian in Madison! The food cart, though, is where I'll be getting my stuff from. It's a bit $$$ for my tastes, as far as restaurant costs go."}
{"text":"One of the two or three best places to eat vegetarian in Madison. I eat from their Library Mall cart all the time--always generous portions, always good. The lentils dish is delicious; make sure you get sour cream on the side."}
{"text":"So, I'm a HUGE fan of the former Buraka location, thus VERY excited to have it join the neighborhood restaurant choices. But I was disappointed with the first try last night, when I ordered two different vegetarian dishes -- one that promised delicious cauliflower in a curry sauce -- but what arrived was a plate of rice with a largish helping of potatoes, two carrots, and barely any sauce on anything -- I mean dry.  No cauliflower in sight -- not a one. And they had run out of enjera - the mainstay of Ethiopian cuisine. And the \"salad\" they served was limp and overdressed -- resembling iceberg soup more closely than any sort of side salad. I will give them another chance because they earned it with the first restaurant -- and I will change this review if the next time is better. But they're going to have to do better than rice and potatoes -- especially for the savvy Willy St. vegetarian crowd. Nice folks, lovely low-key atmosphere. But the food was not ok last night."}
{"text":"Poor restaurant, took 45 minutes(every time) to get the food and the item(injera) for which the people come for Ethiopian wasn't available and instead they gave rice to the curries. The curry was mediocre and this is by far the worst Ethiopian I have been to. Even If you have 2-3 hours available to eat, this restaurant isn't worthy to give a try."}
{"text":"I'm surprised that Baraka's wasn't already on Yelp.  Ethiopian food isn't big on most people's radar, but it is something that most people should try.  It's very similar to Indian and Thai, but with a slight and unique difference in flavor due to the spices they use.  The dinners come with a salad, and a choice of either rice or injera (Ethiopian bread that reminds me of a cross between a crepe and a crumpet).  The dinners (with a couple of exceptions) can be done as 1/2 and 1/2 if you are stuck between choices.  My husband and I went recently.  I got the 1/2 and 1/2 Coconut Chicken Curry and Minchet Abish,  a very spicy beef mix.  I chose the injera bread to mop it up.  You can also order extra injera if you need more.  The spices were incredible, and unlike most dinners out, I finished it all...no doggy bag needed.    My husband got the 1/2 and 1/2 Coconut Chicken Curry and Dorowot, a type of chicken stew, and the rice.   The atmosphere is cozy.  Its not very big, but we were able to get a seat right away.  The staff was friendly as well and were very attentive during our meal."}
{"text":"Sorry I thought it was \"ok\" I have had authentic Ethiopian food ..  you don't get the full experience  .. Although the food was ok, I felt it seasoned well enough, the injera was ok, I wish they brought out the big dishes like authentic restaurants ... Also the entrance is kinda funny, its right next to Kabul's make sure you don't walk into the wrong restaurant. The restaurant was nice and clean, and well decorated, and it had a bar ... thats always a plus"}
{"text":"Hidden jewel since it's underground, it has somewhat of a romantic feel (all exclusive and what not). But what I will tell you is that their food is pretty good. I ordered some samosas as an appetizer. Normally I am picky with Samosas since I feel like they are under stuffed . BUT NOT HERE !   The waitress recommended me Dorowot. Nice and spicy :) Just how I like my food !   Amazing service ! -- The waitress I had is such a cutie !  Ps. Madison's food options are scarce . Eat here . It's actually good ! Don't do decent ."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE service and HORRIBLE food. We waited over an hour for our meals, making us late to an important event. Almost half the items we ordered they \"didn't have available\" which would have been nice to know before we ordered. The food that we were told was not spicy was in fact, quite spicy. The food wasn't even good. Our waitress was slow and didn't listen to requests, (for example, we asked for an extra water cup and never got it, in the entire 1.5 hours we were there). DO NOT RECOMMEND."}
{"text":"Nice Ethiopian spot, good native dishes at a decent price. Has a nice outside seating option or a downstairs one, both work well. Food usually comes out pretty fast, this type of cuisine is great to share, get a family platter so you can try a some of the different dishes. Good place for a change of pace from the everyday typcial American food."}
{"text":"We sat outside on a warm Friday night.  My chair had cobwebs on it, which I understand can form quickly, but still somewhat unsettling.  A big issue was that we seemed to have three waitresses serving us, but none were talking with each other.  Regardless, at least three of the beers on the printed menu were out, and had substitutes.  In my mind, have a separate drink menu that you print each day/week for accuracy.  I finally was able to get a decent IPA.  For food, real small portions for the price.  I ended up getting the Begwot.  I was decent tasting, but just a small amount for the $13 I spent.  At the end of the meal, they wouldn't separate checks, and didn't take my AMEX.  Needless to say, this is one I plan on skipping in the future."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Madison restaurant ever since I walked in 7 years ago.  Their menu hasn't changed in all that time, and I don't mind at all.  Their salad dressing is magical in its deliciousness.  All of their entrees are simple, hearty comfort food--serious meat and potatoes kind of fare!  I took one of the pickiest eaters I've ever met there (she was scared of the place), and she walked away proclaiming it to be \"delicious.\"  Try the Coconut Curry Chicken or the Lamb Tibs--they're the shit.  I would also recommend a refreshing \"Gin & Ting.\"    I love the fact that it's a teeny hole in the wall (or hole in the basement, rather).  It makes me feel happy and smooshy inside just to be there, but it's particularly nice in the fierce cold of a Wisconsin winter.  :)"}
{"text":"I've never been wowed by any dish I've ever had at Buraka.  Sure, they sound exciting.  Why wouldn't Ethiopian food sound exciting?  I've walked away feeling pretty meh everytime I've been there though.  Their food is just okay.  Most of it seems to kind of just taste like spiced red beans and rice to me, and none of the spices particularly exciting.  I don't like their Injera bread either.  The sourness doesn't appeal to me.    It might be that I just don't particularly like Ethiopian food, but I've definitely had better in Berkeley, Ca.  Better injera too."}
{"text":"Buraka is insanely delicious.  I haven't had a bite for a couple years now, having lived out of state, but damn it's good.  My faves were the peanut stew and Misirwot.  Mmm...   Another plus for me, I met my husband here!"}
{"text":"How in the hell did I never eat at this place until just a couple weeks ago? Great East African food and the lunches are cheap! Definitely only for those who love spice and adventure (but if you aren't one of those people then you should probably just stay home every night and cook something flavorless and be miserable away from the rest of us).  I had enjoyed similar styled food before, but had never had it with the injera, which is really the star here.  Imagine spicy stews wrapped in a sourdough crepe and you'll get the idea of what this place offers.  This is my comfort food no matter what the weather. Oh, and the service is pretty good too. They explain everything very well so novices need not be intimidated in trying something a little out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I'd never envisioned Ethiopian as a fast food, but the food cart on Library Mall proves it can be done, and done well.  I like the dorowat, and usually get it with rice.  Actually I don't think I've had their injera yet, but will make an effort to do so soon as everything I've eaten so far has been superb."}
{"text":"My second time at Buraka, my first at the new location, was fabulous! The service was fantastic, including a very knowledgeable and patient sever. I had a combination plate which is half an order each of two entrees. I had the Dorowot and Siga Alicha and both were delicious. The dorowot is slightly spicy and the siga alicha is very mild. The meat in both entrees was very tender and tasty. Now that Buraka is in a more accessible location, there's no excuse to not try this Madison treasure. Ethiopian food isn't scary, I promise!"}
{"text":"This is by far my long-standing favorite for food at the Memorial Library carts."}
{"text":"Wow. This food is simply great. I've usually eaten at their lunchtime food cart, and sometimes at the restaurant on State Street as well. The menu items they have taste consistently great; I like some of the items more than others, but I've never had a bad meal. Some of the dishes are a bit spicy (which I like), so you may want to ask in advance if you prefer something less spicy. This is one of the places I really miss."}
{"text":"Tis good.  Very unique food.  I love the bread, it's unique.  You definitely will be full when you leave.  They also have ginger soda which is amazing."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! The bartender (Corey) is incompetent. The food is not good, this time not only was my injera ice cold but so was the rice.  Nothing is good here."}
{"text":"If there was the possibility for a .5 star, Buraka would be a 3.5 but I will round up in this case. This is my first foray into the restaurant that replaced Jolly Bob's.  They did a nice job brightening up the space and it was clean and cozy.   We stopped in on a quiet Monday night and tried a few dishes-tostones, siga alicha (beef curry stew, dorowot (chicken in a red sauce), begwot (lamb in a red sauce) and tibs (we opeted for chicken) with extra injera.  Flavor wise, the food was well spiced and tasted great.  What I take exception to is that toughness to the cuts of meat.  As all the dishes were braised, there is no excuse for this.  Service was fine and the waitress was helpful in providing suggestions on what to get/not get.  The choices for east African are limited in Madison and if they improve on their food execution, I wouldn't think twice about returning.  If not, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Love the new location and the renovation is nothing short of amazing!  Can't wait for patio weather!  Food? Awesome,  as always."}
{"text":"I love ethnic food, and Buraka fits well onto the State Street scene. Their dorowat dish is amazing and I recommend trying their injera. It is some sort of Ethiopian flatbread, and absolutely delicious  Be adventurous and try a family style platter served all over injera! Its great if you and your friends are trying a few dishes. We got 4 different dishes and all were good! My favorite was the Dorowat and Chicken Peanut Stew which had an awesome peanut butter taste."}
{"text":"I know it's supposed to be served like that but you better eat quickly before your injera gets soggy and loses all of its structural integrity. Coconut curry is good as is the peanut chicken. I've had order screw ups before but only a couple times on minor things so no big deal. The patio is definitely worth checking out"}
{"text":"One morning we went to find a place for a latte and espresso. Four places later and four disappointments we were beginning to get frustrated. We stopped in here just to try the food quick and saw the selection of coffees, gave it a shot. Wow! Was a really nice surprise and would highly recommend. It's not a yuppie hangout do if you like that atmosphere you'll be disappointed."}
{"text":"Okay, so here's the disclaimer: I'm not super familiar with Ethiopian food.  That said, is Ethiopian food supposed to be this bland? And what is the deal with the spongey bread thing that I'm supposed to use to make a semi-spicy soupy burrito? Kinda gross, if you ask me.  I gave up on the bread quickly and the rest of the meal wasn't much better, as it just sort of tasted like old Indian food with fewer spices and more carrots.  The restaurant is surprisingly comfortable, though, and a lot roomier than expected. So there, you earned yourself a second star.  And if you like Gluten-free beer, they have it. My buddy ordered one by accident (which, unless you have Celiac disease, is the only reason I assume someone would order it)"}
{"text":"So Buraka. Meh.  First of all, this is definitely not a vegan restaurant. They have three vegan items; one is a soup, which is a comparable spread to many establishments. They are notably missing some of the standard dishes vegans will crave, and their alecha, mysteriously, is vegetarian but not vegan.   I ordered the misirwat, forgoing the soup and the third thing I can't remember. The injera is standard, passable, but the misirwat was not at all what I expect when ordering that dish. It was not spicy, it was not dense, it was not pureed, it had potatoes in it (wth?) and it was *very* tomatoey and salty--- sort of like it was bathed in tomato soup. Also, despite having specified vegan, I was given a dish with a big scoop of (sour cream? soft cheese? I'm not sure, but it definitely was some dairy thing).   I appreciate that they kind of tried, but I won't be doing this again."}
{"text":"I was just here earlier tonight , and I loved it! It was my first time since they reopened on Willy St. They had a special menu for Black Restaurant Week, and after an internal debate, I went for it. I started out with the tostones (I have a weakness for plantains), and then really enjoyed their salad of greens and lentils. I went with the Begwot (lamb and carrots) with injera and the cheesecake for dessert. The Begwot was very tasty, although it could have been a little spicier. I also enjoyed a rum punch. Everything was delicious; we sat in their patio which was really nice. Service was good but not great. I can't wait to go back and try other things like the chicken coconut curry or the chicken peanut stew!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the service was lacking.   My fiance and I stopped in for dinner around 7:30 on Sunday night, and the restaurant was bustling but not packed. We were sat at a table with menus fairly quickly, and then from there, things went downhill. We perused the short menu fairly quickly and were ready to order when the same guy that sat us came to bring us waters (5 minutes after seating us) but he just dropped the waters off and immediately left. There were two tables nearby that weren't bussed for a good 10-15 minutes. A different waitress came around about 10 minutes after we got waters to take our orders. After that...we waited 30-40 minutes for our food to come out. Our waitress checked on us once or twice during that time and told us our food was \"almost ready!\" When we finally received our misirwot/begwot family style platter, we devoured it in about 5 minutes. Then we sat around for another 10 minutes until our server saw us with the empty plate in front of us and said she would go get our check. 5 minutes later we had to flag her down, whereupon we were informed we should actually go up to the bar to pay as it would be faster.   Most of this review is about the service and not about the food, because the food (though good) was such a small part of this experience. Buraka, please get your FOH act together. There needs to be more/better communication between your servers and maybe you should get an expediter. Your food is good, but not good enough for me to wait 45 minutes for it."}
{"text":"Buraka stews are incredibly delicious.  The meat is tender and vegetables are cooked till they're soft.  If you decide to get the bread instead of the rice, pick a stronger tasting stew, since ones like the Chicken Peanut stew are too light to complement it.  A great way to save money is to buy full portions from the cart in Library Mall during lunch time."}
{"text":"That left a bad taste in my mouth. We loved the food so much last time that we decided to order take out. We were just told over the phone that they \"can't really do that right now\" and to call back in 20 minutes.  So many other ways to go about that.  I can understand if you're busy and that we may have to wait longer to pick up, but you always have time to take an order. It pains me to leave this review, but you've forced us to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Meh...This is the second time I've had ethiopian food, so I'm no expert, but I can tell when food is flavorful or not. Severely lacking in depth of flavor. It was cooked potatoes/lentils/etc on injera. A little bit of curry flavoring? Service wasn't great as we waited for 1 person to run the restaurant....Wouldn't return."}
{"text":"10 years ago, I got my very 1st taste of Burakas and I have never forgotten it. My absolute favorite is the Dorowot. For those who are new and not knowing  what to expect, I find this to be a good choice for several reasons. I like that is just a basic mix of chicken and carrots in a curry sauce over the rice. Personally, I love the spice level of it, but the sour cream they serve on the side can help you make each bite less spicy with just a dip of sour cream. This is one of my all time favorite meals, and because I don't live in the area, and I craved it so much,I actually learned to make something that tastes pretty close. It will never be as good as the real thing, but I have gotten several people hooked on it.. I always tell them I can't wait for them to try the real thing. Buraka's Dorowot over rice with lentils!!!!! MMMMMMMmmmm so good!"}
{"text":"I went in for lunch during the week. It was relatively empty but it was late in the lunch hour. The food came out pretty quick but the presentation was different than any other ethiopian restaurant I've been in. I got the lunch combo with dorowat and Minchet abish.  The plate had a piece of injera on it folded in half. The other half of the plate was filled with a tangy lentil salad that was OKAY. The folded injera had one scoop of both meats on it - I was worried that was all I was getting. It also had a glob of sour cream - not sure why. Luckily, when I unfolded the injera there was more food inside.  Still, it seemed kind of pricey for the amount you get. I've had better Ethiopian food.  I'd consider coming back due to the dearth of african options, but would probably get some other food that Madison excels in."}
{"text":"I would give this one a 3.5 or a 3.75....It's a neat little setting in the basement, below Husnu's, I think....nice art on the walls. Their house salad, I have to say, was the most boring thing ever....lettuce leaves drizzled in some olive oil. period.   Some of their entrees are good. I like the peanut chicken stew....i think few of their entrees can be repetitive....different meats but similar sauce/preparation....I would have liked to see some creativity in there!....  The injera (bread) is a bit too sour for my taste and it overpowers the flavor of your stew...go with the rice.  The 2 hot sauces are really good, though....ask for them.  All in all, good comfort food on a cold winter evening.....but didn't bow me away...  Btw, they have a cart in Henry mall during lunchtime and have several of the same entrees that they have for dinner....so I'd just try those out to see you're into their food."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a few dishes which are vegan or can be made vegan. It has an emphasis on comfort-food type dishes, such as lentil stews with injera (a fluffy type of bread, similar to a soft South Indian dosa). I would go here if you're looking for something totally different from the usual South and East Asian vegan options in Madison."}
{"text":"We decided on this place because we wanted to sit outside and wanted to try something new.  A+ on the sweet potato fries.  AMAZING, in fact.  We ordered a platter with two entrees on it, and we thought it was pretty tasty.  We would definitely go back for the location, outdoor seating and for the fries.  Good service also."}
{"text":"We went to the restaurant for dinner to take a break from studying. Upon entering, it seemed like a nice place. We ordered our food promptly, but that was about the quickest thing. We waited for 30+ minutes for out food to come out when we were the only ones eating at the time. We were also told that \"it's not [their] policy to split the check\" I was fine with this until we realized this was because they wanted to tack on a gratuity of 18% for a group of 6, when I was planning on 10% tops for the poor service."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been there many times. There aren't many places to get good African cuisine in Madison. Beautiful outdoor seating for a nice afternoon or evening and great  indoor atmosphere. Great atmosphere and staff!!!"}
{"text":"I ate there this past summer and it was alright.  We were looking for a new place to try and decided on this because they had outdoor seating.  We went inside to let them know we were outside and it appeared that only one woman was bartending and waitressing.  She said she'd be right out and it took 10 minutes before we saw her.  We ordered drinks and it took another 15 minutes before we saw those.  Granted a big party was in the midst of leaving while we were waiting, but they probably should have had one more waitress.  We had heard great things about the food and while my boyfriend liked it, I found it sort of bland.  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  Not sure I'd go back right away."}
{"text":"I have absolutely no idea what authentic African cuisine tastes like, but I have a pretty good idea what skillfully prepared fresh flavorful food tastes like, and Buraka definitely is that.  Their menu has a wide selection of stews and other items. There is lots of vegetarian options but they also serve beef, lamb, and chicken. One can choose to have your dish with either rice or injera. Go for the injera it's a soft bubbly tortilla-like bread that you can wrap your food in or eat on the side. (The taste and texture is so good.) They have items with a variety of spiciness. In general, Buraka is amazing.  Buraka also has a cart on Library Mall, it is a fantastic deal."}
{"text":"Great experience dining at Buraka! I had heard good things from friends about this restaurant and it did not disappoint. We went at 2:30 on a Tuesday afternoon, so it was pretty empty but the service was still great. There is ample street parking outside as with most of Willy Street. Upon walking inside, I was surprised at how much space was inside - there was bar seating and an entire back room. Everything was very new and clean, and our waitress was very friendly. Also, the awesome reggae music gave the place a very casual atmosphere.  My friend and I both ordered the combination lunch with Dorowot and Begwot served on a plate of rice. It came with a lentil salad and a dollop of sour cream on the side. The food came out very fast and was a comfortable serving size. Everything in the meal went extremely well together - the Dorowot was a very comforting and rich stew, and the lamb in the Begot was cooked tenderly. I was surprised at the lentils because I didn't realize they would be a cold salad instead of hot lentils, but it was a nice contrast. Both were very very mildly spicy but not anything too intense!   Overall, really tasty food but lost a star because there was nothing that was extremely out of the ordinary. Really happy to see this Ethiopian restaurant in Madison and would definitely recommend for people in the area to try out! The menu also has nice history of Ethiopian food and the restaurant to help give the food a historical context, which I always feels contributes to the dining experience. Would love to return another time!  Food: 8/10 Service: 8/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Prices: $-$$"}
{"text":"How the hell did this place get a 4 star rating? Maybe it's different in person but I bet not! I just paid $40.00 for a Styrofoam plate with a few ounces of potatoes and gravy and soggy rubber flatbread that reminded me of half-cooked pancakes. I ordered a combo dinner and they put both \"stews\" on the same plate on top of these batter flops so you didn't know what was what. Plus it was a mere 1/2 cup of each with a few shreds of meat. When the guy delivered it and handed it to me I thought there had to be something missing because I felt I was taking a bag of chips from him! The Duck Won Ton appetizers were the best thing about the whole experience.   I was sadly disappointed for two Jacksons that's for sure..."}
{"text":"Totally don't get the neg' reviews. Maybe they were based on experiences closer to opening? Maybe they don't like Ethiopian food? This place is excellent! It would be great anywhere, but for Madison ethnic food of any ilk, it truly stands out as one of the best. I've had Ethiopian food in New York, London, San Francisco, Chicago. . .and Buraka compares favorably. Service was fast, attentive and friendly. Only disappointment was the Ethiopian style tartar was unavailable. Mixed drinks and dessert were also very well done."}
{"text":"I've never been in here before- from the outside it looked super bright and obnoxious, but no! It's in a nice, cozy basement. The wooden bar and decor were super mellow and the place was dimly lit. I had a few different Ethiopian beers (there are four different bottles of it on the menu), the plantains and the coconut curry chicken. We chose the spongy bread instead of rice, and it was a good decision. That bread was soft and subtly flavored- perfect for wiping up sauce. Everything was very tasty. Now that I know it's there and not lit with flourescents, I will have to go back and try all of the other dishes."}
{"text":"I want to like it. I really do. I've been twice, but each time I found the dishes bland ... or with a spiciness that was just spice, not flavor."}
{"text":"I trusted the madison yelpers to help me find good restaurants and madison and buraka was among the very top there. Unfortunately, the food wasn't anything special. It wasn't bad in any way, just a little bland and not inspiring. I've had better east african food in most african restaurants in chicago."}
{"text":"Service and location were very good. Food - that was another matter.  I don't want to sound unkind: if this food was made in my kitchen,  I'd be intensely proud. But, I would know it's Ethiopean-LIKE, and NOT traditional/authentic. I am spoiled with having so many Ethiopean restaurants in Minneapolis,  so expected similar taste.  Chicken Dorowat must be served on a bone with a hard boiled egg. It is served this way in every such restaurant I've ever been too, including those in Washington DC. Sauces were ok, but not authentic or flavorful enough. Injera was very good. Overall it was delicious, but nothing like I expected."}
{"text":"Buraka is back! And it is just as wonderful as before! On my son's birthday, two years ago, we were heading up State Street for this restaurant but we found rubble where Buraka used to stand. The block was being redeveloped and our favorite restaurant was the casualty.   We were distressed and desperate for a replacement - we even tried buying teff flour and making our own injera - but it was nothing like Buraka.  Then last year, a friend (thanks Juan) let us know that the restaurant would reopen on Willy Street. Whenever we were on the East Side we would drive by and monitor the slow process of construction.  And then finally it opened! From the outside, it looks small but the old Buraka also looked tiny from the street. Looks can be deceiving! It stretches back for a good while and the rooms are fairly spacious with brightly-painted walls. And the food is just like it was: tasty, different, engaging to eat.  This is what we missed all those years! We're so glad you're back, Buraka!"}
{"text":"I wish this city had more African restaurants and personally, I am desperate for a Swahili restaurant, but Ethiopian is as close as I will get in this town.  At least we have Buraka! The new location is way nicer than their previous basement location, but the food is still the same great quality.  If I'm being honest, I don't think I've ever had any entree other than the Dorowot, because it's amazing. It's flavorful, spicy and the portion you get is big enough for at least one more meal, if not two. The Samoosa is fantastically spicy, and shouldn't be missed. They can even mix a decent drink to help wash down your spicy meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite food cart on library mall.  In addition to the food cart, I have eaten at the restaurant a few times. Dishes are intended to be eaten \"family style\" although they don't have to be. And yes, it's true, that the majority of dishes are stews.  My favorite and their top ordered item is the chicken dorowat with injera--stewed chicken and carrots in a tomato-y sauce with cold lentil salad on the side and injera (ethiopian flatbread). yum!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Lunch has better portions and menu. Definitely try the \"Mango Drink,\" it's thick and very sweet. Great vegetarian options, too!"}
{"text":"Probably more like 3 1/2 stars. The decor was best described as eclectic mediocrity. The food was good. Especially the coconut curry. Also, try the tostones but go easy on the sauce. Its a little hot for my wimpy self. Good selection of both domestic microbrews and some African imports. Oddly enough, I thought the mint chocolate cheesecake  stole the show. I would definitely go again."}
{"text":"I used to work here while a student in Madison, and I can tell you the food is phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Great service and real, slow cooked food for a very low price. It's the kind of meal that while you are driving or walking home, you feel good about yourself and what you ate and you don't have icky food hangover.  Extremely simple stews served with perfect injera. The plantains were also amazing and I have no idea what was in the sauce with the plantains, but we could have eating it with a spoon...actually I think we did. The place is not pretty, but my family of four hungry people ate heartily for under $60, so I'm happy to forfeit ambiance."}
{"text":"Amazing food! The beef samosas was so flavorful and so was the food. I'll be returning back if I ever go back to Wisconsin. Do not sleep on this gem that's surrounded by pubs and bars!"}
{"text":"This review is for the food cart on Library Mall, which I hope is still operating despite the fact that their storefront location has been forced to close its doors thanks to the development plans on State Street.   If not, at least I can say I tried it!   So I went with the chicken peanut stew with red potatoes and lentil salad wrapped in injera, and while it wasn't something I'd come running back for, it was slightly satisfying on the cold day that I was able to enjoy it.  This selection was unique, but all of the components did work well together to formulate a cohesive, hearty dish. I would have perhaps appreciated more chicken, but maybe that's just me and my protein-obsessed-self. I just felt that the dish was a tad heavy on the carbs, what with the red potatoes and the lentils and the injera (Ethiopian sourdough flatbread).   I must say that the injera took me by surprise. I was expecting the typical flatbread dough, yet the injera was unexpectedly thin (almost crepe-like, yet still dense) and had a rather sour taste to it, resemblant of the taste you get from your average sourdough loaf, though much more pronounced.   I also appreciated the peanut stew/sauce component. The flavors were great and welcomingly savory.   While the chicken peanut stew wouldn't be my first choice in a return visit, it did make for a decent meal."}
{"text":"Headline: uninviting, great Dorowat, first-Ethiopian-success  My colleague and I were just in Madison for the day so we decided to stop into Buraka for a late lunch. It's a little uninviting at first since it's located in the basement of the building, but once you get downstairs it's fairly open and friendly.   This was my first time having Ethiopian food so I went for the house special, the Dorowat, which my colleague described as the \"Pad Thai of Ethiopian food.\" I really enjoyed the dish; the flavors weren't as unfamiliar as I expected they might be. Also, the waitress made me think that it was going to be spicy, but it was rather mild, still to my liking--the spicy sauce that comes out on the side is really hot though! The Injera bread was pretty good too, but next time I'll try the rice.   All-in-all, I enjoyed my experience and I'll give Ethiopian food another go soon!"}
{"text":"I was here this past weekend with a group of 6. We decided to order (almost) every item on the appetizer menu and share them between us all. Even having been to Buraka many times in the past, I had not yet tried most of the appetizers. I was really excited to get to try all these items. All of the appetizers, with the exception of the soup and tostones, are served with the house dipping sauce. This sauce is rich with flavor and spice and tastes great on everything. They should sell this stuff in bottles! It's got a decent amount of spice to it, but if you're looking for even more, ask them about their green super hot sauce.   Duck Wonton - (Duck bacon, charred sweet corn, and cream cheese inside a wonton wrapper) This was INCREDIBLE. Creamy and very flavorful.   Yucca Fries - These were fine. Yucca is a mild and rather bland food naturally, and that's how these fries were.   Samoosa - (Delicate deep fried filled with minced beef, chicken or lentils and marinated in a rich variety of Ethiopian spices) We ordered the beef samoosas. These have always been my favorite appetizer. Large in size and packed pretty densely with a meat and spice blend that is delicious.   Spicy Sweet Potato Fries - Exactly what you would expect, except theirs are seasoned with the \"secret\" berbere spice. Whatever this spice is made of, it's really good and adds a nice punch of flavor to an otherwise pretty bland food item. Not a big fan of sweet potato myself, but these were actually pretty darn good and I enjoyed them quite a bit.    Tostones - (Deep fried slices of plantain) These were yummy! They add just the right amount of sweetness to the otherwise very rich and savory meal you eat.   Coconut Shrimp - Not a huge fan of coconut myself, but after hearing everyone at the table say that these were literally the best coconut shrimp they have ever had in their lives, I decided to try one. The breading/coconut coating was so light and crispy yet flavorful. It really was extremely good.   Lentil Soup - This was the only one we ordered that I didn't actually try. Those who did, though, said it was amazing.   Duck Tenders - (Almond crusted duck tenderloin) Wow. Honestly I didn't think I would like these. Now, I think they just might be my new favorite. They are smaller than what you think of when you think tender. The almond in the crust is very noticeable and adds to the overall flavor. These were great with or without the sauce."}
{"text":"As you descend the steps to Buraka's underground location, be prepared for a truly other-worldy experience. This is a small, dimly-lit restaurant serves up some serious Ethiopian cuisine. You have to be adventurous to enjoy dining here, some of the dishes and flavors are very different than what you would find in most other Madison establishments. All of it is quality, no doubt, and very intriguing. There was one server on staff the night I went, but she did a great job of keeping up, and was very informed about the menu. You could hear her chatting to the Hispanic kitchen staff in Spanish whenever she walked by the kitchen window. Definitely an interesting combination of cultures. It took me a few minutes to realize I was in Madison after I left Buraka's dark, pungent semblance."}
{"text":"Ben and the rest of the staff created an amazing experience for our 18+ group. We had family style service which made the 10+ kids happy and kept the adult completely feed. So glad that this place is open close to us. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Search for Ethiopian Restaurants on Madison Yelp and you get 1. Count them 1,..1,..1...  This place will work. Duck downstairs away from the h/bustle of State Street and find yourself in a lovely cool and calm space with a bar and two big dining rooms. It's not the biggest menu I've ever seen but it has the basics. We had  a Lamb tibs and a Chicken with peanut sauce and the lentil/potato as a combination plate. Both served with injeera. The tef-based flat bread was excellent. The other dishes were missing something. We looked at each other with a \"what's wrong here\" look. Aha!!!   S.U. called the waitress over and asked if they had Berbere sauce (the Ethiopean hot sauce). That's what was missing. A few drops of that and it was all good. The mouth burned, the sweat flowed, the flavors came alive!!!!  So, I am a fan. I understand that the typical Wisconsinite may not immediately love the spiciness that Ethiopian cuisine can bring to the game (or eating with the hands, forks are provided). So I say this. Ask for The Sauce or say, up-front that you like The Spice. They'll bring it! Game on!"}
