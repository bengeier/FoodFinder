{"text":"I've been here a number of times since it opened and it has been GREAT every time. 

The staff are super friendly and helpful with recommendations and the space feels lovely and welcoming. 

Now, let's talk about that pepper shrimp. YUM. It's one of those dishes that keeps you thinking about it between visits and continues luring you back. The spiciness caught me a bit off-guard the first time, but it was worth sweating it out. The festival dumplings are stunning and when paired with that pepper shrimp sauce: omg. 

I've also tried the curry chicken and the chickpea & potato curry and they too were delicious, though they don't haunt me like a delicious spicy peppery ghost. 

This place is such a great addition to the neighbourhood. Eat there!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here a half dozens times or more. The food has never disappointed. I am of Caribbean background and can validate that the food is legit. The hearty soup is amazing on a cold day. THe jerk chicken, curry or ox tail are very good lunch options. Doubles on the weekends! This will be a regular lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"Was on the East side last night and was craving seafood. Saw the ad for this place and am so happy I went! The Pepper Shrimp was made fresh and was delicious. The portions were huge and I just at the leftovers for lunch! The service was amazing and I even got to meet the cook. Will for sure come back."}
{"text":"Food here taste elevated compared to the regular Caribbean take out food. 
Rice and peas has a nice delicate flavour unlike the other places where it's either bland or overpowered by sauce.  Pepper shrimps were fresh and delicious. Calaloo roti a must try.  The festivals will make anyone forget about their low-carb diet. 
I didn't give 5 because I waited 40 minutes for my 2 take out orders while the restaurant was empty.  Perhaps the quality of the food explains the long wait.  But I shudder to think what will they cope if the place is full."}
{"text":"The best festivals I've ever eaten outside Jamaica hands down. The curry goat and pepper steak is a must have and the curry chicken. The goat was tender spiced right and nice. Sold out of oxtails. The coconut water cut freshly open with the Wray & Newphew you must get. Only thing needs to be changed is the jerk chicken I like mine grilled not baked."}
{"text":"Been craving curry goat roti all day and I finally got it. Thankfully I didn't have to go far to get it either as I live walking distance from Caribbean Sunset Restaurant. They definitely did not let me down. It was absolutely delicious and hit the spot so nice. I even got free homemade chilli which was so on point. It's not necessarily spicy but it's very flavourful, which complemented the curry goat really well. The church chickpea & potato curry was great too. Overall 5/5, will be back to try the oxtail soon!"}
{"text":"delicious food and not expansive . would recommend to friends. hope more locations willl be opened in the gta.

{"text":"Ordered here from ubereats. I will admit I've never had Caribbean food before so I have nothing to compare it to but it was absolutely delicious ! I had the jerk chicken, rice and peas and potato curry. The rice and peas were so flavourful and spicy. Prices are very reasonable and you get a TON of food. I had enough for two huge meals. Will definitely return again!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the Jerk chicken with rice and peas and chickpea potato curry. Chicken was flavorful and juicy. Portion size was great and the price is right. Employees provided a welcoming atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome little restaurant on queen east.
 Had the jerk chicken with rice and peas and chickpea potato curry. Jerk chicken had a lot of flavor. Highlight was the homemade pepper sauce, sooo good. Service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"We've been meaning to try this place. It was a very tasty and satisfying meal. I had the oxtail with rice and peas, hubby had goat curry with dumplings, and Mac cheese pie. Also tried the homemade beef patty. Pricing was reasonable and portions were big. Service was excellent as the waitress explained the menu, checked up on us often and the food didn't take very long to come out. 
The homemade hot sauce was excellent.  They also have daily specials on their sign outside. My only regret is not taking pics of the food to post."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now. Had the oxtail, jerk chicken and jerk pork. It was amazing every time. 

Possibly the best jerk chicken and jerk pork I've had in Toronto, and that's no small feat since I eat Jamaican/Caribbean a lot (Simone's, Raps, Under the Table, Real Jerk etc. etc.) Just incredibly flavourful with a legit level of spice.  Really juicy and tender.

Their daily deals are great too. Friday deal is the best since oxtail is normally $18, but you can get it with rice & peas for $10 that day."}
{"text":"Wow...I make a lot of Caribbean food but it is the best flavour I have ever had. I have been 3 times in the last week! The callaloo is out of this world, the jerk flavour is sooo awesome too and I could
Go on about all of the dishes. We do it family style while there so we can enjoy and try all the dishes. I am thinking of going back and wondering what to order? The rice and peas too. A lot of flavour and done with the secret way out grandma used to make it. Secret recipes for sure! All natural and pure ingredients too."}
