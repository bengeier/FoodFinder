{"text":"Great food and huge portions. Our server, Alli, was awesome. Just make sure your hungry!"}
{"text":"It was a beautiful Friday night, my wife and I wanted to hit the town. Most restaurant had a long waiting list. But this place strike our eyes. The setting was nice, the service was good. The only problem we had was this place doesn't do good dinner!!! It explains the empty dining room. The calamari sticks was very odd!!! If you are know for breakfast, I think you should stick to what your good at. It was worth the adventure."}
{"text":"I was super excited to go to this place because I saw it on the news and also saw there was one in the valley. The place is beautiful. My daughter and I received a super nice warm greeting when you entered. I thought alright this would be a good experience and a new place to go to. But afterwards I think maybe not. I will probably try again for maybe lunch or see if they do lunch but if not much better than breakfast probably go elsewhere. Our waitress was not warm at all in fact I would maybe say a tad salty like the food here. I don't know if it was a bad day though it was still early but it just felt pushy and not warm at all. The best part of the meal was the jam they give you for the toast. I heard from someone walking in they had good coffee I was disappointed with it as my mother who likes coffee as well. I had their biscuits and gravy and it was salty and also the sausage chucks were too much awesome they included that but way to big for my taste(I had other food but it was okay just okay though). I had a bite of my moms chicken fried steak and that was actually quite good. But I would love to say this place was amazing because I had such high hopes but nope maybe try again and try another breakfast meal maybe I got one that wasn't the best but other than that I have gotten better food from little greasy diners."}
{"text":"We had the Hawaiian Chicken Sandwich and fries and prime rib and baked potato. This was our first time here. Food was just ok. We probably won't be back for dinner, but would like to come back to try their breakfast."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have been here.  The first time, it was great.  Food was fabulous and the servers friendly. ... I decided to bring my husband.  After 10 minutes, I had ask for water and then we got a server.  It was not busy and the waitresses were just standing at the counter talking...Ugh!  Not so sure now that I will be back"}
{"text":"It was one of those \"I don't know, where do you want to eat\" nights and saw their sign on the 101.  We've been back 3x since. We haven't made it to breakfast yet and based on other reviews, are missing out!

But we have thoroughly enjoyed each of our dinners - service, food & atmosphere are spot on. Will be back for breakfast one of these days for sure."}
{"text":"First time here. Great  food and fast service. Lots and lots of food for the price. Michelle Stanton was our waitress she was awesome!  Will be back."}
{"text":"Food came out fast. The greeting when we came in was ok. I would go back again for breakfast. I visited place during a weekday when it was not to busy."}
{"text":"We make special trips to Prescott for Lone Spur so we are super excited to have one in the valley! We still drive from the East Valley but it's worth it! Our favorite breakfasts. Huge amounts of food! The French toast and the biscuits and gravy are my favorite. We've loved everything we've gotten here. We will be back over and over and over again!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and excellent service. Really thick bacon. Large portions. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"It holds up to the original in Prescott, and I can give it no higher compliment than that! Our favorite breakfast place of all time, the Peoria Lone Spur has the same great food and service we loved while living up north. The location is easily accessible off the freeway and nice and new. We even discovered a good-sized farmers market in the same complex - good to walk off some of those calories after an amazing Saturday brunch!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast on a Sunday morning.  Food was okay, not great.  Service was sub par.  Our waitress knew the folks at a table by us and she spent most of her time talking to them.  She did not refill my lemonade, not even once!"}
{"text":"First time ever visiting today. Was there about 8:30 am or so. Took my mom for breakfast. She had the wagon wheel pancake with eggs and bacon. I had the junior burrito with country potatoes and coffee. Coffee was good. Mom really enjoyed her pancake 

There was a hair in my potatoes so I couldn't eat any more. Had to ask twice for more coffee. (2 nd cup). 


Didn't say anything to waitstaff about the \" foreign object \" in my breakfast as I didn't want to cause my mom to lose her appetite as well. But also because I never saw the server soon enough to tell her. 

First and last trip."}
{"text":"I want to thank one of the owners for responding to my previous review which I removed myself due to the genuine interest he showed in us the last three times we have been in. I should have addressed the issues I had in the restaurant and NOT on here. Thanks Lone Spur Cafe. I say the Joe's Special is the best meal on the menu!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time
 Not last. Friendly servers. Plenty food.
Fun decor. Large room.

 Parking is iffy. Don't be afraid to walk a little. Perfect for Sun City. Not crowded tables. Music a bit loud for table conversation."}
{"text":"Dude..strike 1..pancakes mixed with water strike 2..a place with a western theme with CANNED CORNED BEEF AND HASHstrike 3 they melt cheese into the eggs via microwaveI don't understand how this place is so busypeople in this area clearly are not accustomed to good food."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 5 people. Our service was extremely slow. The food was pretty expensive. My french toast was nearly $20, although it was the best french toast I have ever had.."}
{"text":"Great breakfast! I had the French Toast special and took half of it home, it was a pretty good sized plate of food and the French Toast is unique and different with the corn flake coating. Great service as well."}
{"text":"We had to leave here after sitting for an hour. The waitress never brought creamer after asking a few times. The manager said the lost our ticket after we asked where the food was after an hour wait. The worst part is we had to ask for our food before they even noticed that we had been waiting for so long. The manager even had poor customer service. The food at least looked decent but we ended up having to leave because we couldn't wait the hour and a half and waitress and manager were unapologetic."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. We had 3 diners and none of us were able to eat everything. Sausage gravy was especially tasty."}
{"text":"Great service Great Great breakfast!! Love the super size portions, love the smiles and service. Will come back time and time again!!! get it cowboy style!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim. Had the French toast & egg breakfast. Pretty good. Different take on the norm. What really stood out was the service. Christina & another young lady (shorter but didn't get her name) we're awesome) they should be teaching classes to other establishments. I would come back simple just for the level of service offered here."}
{"text":"I had the worse service ever. I had a server named Kim she constantly used cuss words and telling unnecessary jokes about other servers. My eggs was not cooked the way I asked, I ask her if I could get them cooked again Over medium please she snorkel at me and sure but I think this is best your going to get the kitchen seems to not be able to get that part right. She seems to not care about the restaurant and people in there. I will not be back for the simple fact that I might get again. I would like to enjoy my meal without the extra nonsense!"}
{"text":"Cowboy huge breakfast. Weak coffee.  Cold beans.sent plate back. Then Excellent food. Huevos Rancheros on a huge platter. Yum."}
{"text":"Good food... even better customer service.

It's  almost impossible to find a breakfast that will rival the 1970/80s type quality,  and goodness.   This restaurant gives it a run for the money.

Our server was awesome. 
Thanks Michelle.!!"}
{"text":"You will have a bit of a wait, but it is worth it. Everything we had from the biscuit and gravy cinnamon bread french toast chicken fried steak was amazing. The service was excellent"}
{"text":"Place has a great breakfast and friendly staff. Been there several times for breakfast and lunch. But let's face it, nothing beats great breakfast food."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight and we were pleasantly surprised to get seated right away! We wondered how this experience was going to be given its not very busy on a Friday night. 
My husband ordered prime rib and I ordered the scampi. The scampi were nice and big, just enough garlic butter. My husband said his prime rib was tender even though it was an end piece (he likes it cooked medium well). Our portions were large which is nice for the price. Wish there were a few more apps to choose from and I didn't see any dessert. The waitress was very friendly and talkative. 
Tip: She told us they will start serving their breakfast and lunch menu for dinner as of next week. Some items on the dinner menu will still be offered too. Will be back for BFD!!"}
{"text":"Wow what a breakfast. I had the Cowboy Benedict. I ordered the half size and it was enough food for several people. You get a buttermilk biscuit split open, a very thick piece of ham, a fried egg, and it's topped with sausage gravy with big chunks of sausage in it.  And if that's not enough you get a big heap of wonderful hash brown potatoes. Everything on that plate was so tasty. The service was friendly, quick and helpful. And the restaurant was cheerful and fun with its cowboy decor. A great place to meet up with family and friends for a meal."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant, nicely decorated.  However, the service was terrible, 40 minutes to get breakfast.  We gave Lone Spur a 2nd chance but this will be our last visit.  Very sad because it has great potential."}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly. Bacon wrapped shrimp app was delicious. Laid back atmosphere was very comfortable. Good steak and huge baked potato."}
{"text":"We were just at the Lone Spur after waiting for over an hour for our food only to be told that the orders weren't matching up and our order wasn't ready. So we left advising our waitress we would never be back. It seems every time we go there they always have issues."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. I had the \"Lasso\" a build your own breakfast. I had heard the has great biscuits and gravy. No they weren't, they were GREAT. The gravy was so thick that my crispy thick cut bacon could stand up in the gravy. I am looking forward to many more excellent breakfasts in the future. Chelsea was our server and she was awesome, kept me supplied with hot water for my tea and decaf for my friend."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place! I had the chicken fried steak, eggs and biscuits and gravy, my son ordered the meat lovers, my daughter had the southwestern omelette. Every dish was fabulous!!! It was very busy, we sat outside with my kids dog and Edwardo was our amazing server. Although it was busy he kept our coffee hot and gave us plenty of attention. I highly recommend this place for your next breakfast outing! Thank you Edwardo for your excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"This is our new breakfast spot.  Service is great, food awesome,  and prices are decent.  They are busier on weekends and they seem to stay that way but it doesn't affect the service at all."}
{"text":"My family loves this place the food has always been delicious. No complaints from us and the staff is awesome!"}
{"text":"Food was good but only down fall is the chicken fried steak is not homemade same chicken fried steak you get at IHOP.  The rest of the food was great and service on point."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were excited to try this new cafe near us but it was disappointing from the minute we walked in the door. The hostess didn't even acknowledge us as we stood right in front of her for the first couple of minutes. When she did, we asked to sit at the bar top but she didn't give us menus so we had to wait for the waitress to find some for us. 

Cut to the food... I ordered the breakfast sandwich.  The potatoes were burnt and had no seasoning. The sandwich bread was falling apart and the cheese was just thrown on.. not melted at all. 
My boyfriend was equally unimpressed with his steak and eggs. The steak was also under seasoned and so were his potatoes. The biscuits and gravy were completely overly seasoned and it tasted like I put a spoonful of salt in my mouth. All in all we spent $35 and wish we had went through McDonalds instead. At least then the price would have matched the quality. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Only gave it two because the service was okay,  although there was only about 5 tables sat. If you like Dennys and ihop then you might like this place.  Everything taste like it's from a package,  hash browns taste like they are rehydrated and bacon taste like leather.  I was expecting something closer to a homemade feel but just another chain with questionable food."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot, portions are huge and food is tasty, my choice is the Spanish cowboy, its a skillet with chorizo, jalapenos, potatoes, and my eggs over medium...pretty damn good. The service is consistently good, and friendly, my only issue as trivial as this may sound is the tea is VERY weak.....This review is for the Glendale location."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for awhile and I have been craving a big breakfast for quite awhile now. This place was awesome, the food was very good and our sever was great. I'm glad she asked if I wanted a full or half order of the Cowboy Benedict's. I opted for the half order since I'm a big boy and for her to ask if I only wanted a half , I figured it really must be huge portions. My order was still huge and I didn't finish. My wife had a short stack of pancakes that were as big as a steering wheel and very tasty. My only gripe was how weak the coffee was. With all the cowboy art work and names of dishes, you would think they'd have a better brew. Will definitely go back again, but hit the farmers market on Saturday first then eat."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I have been here, I will never go back! It is in a strip mall facing Northern, you must either park and walk along the front sidewalk or go down thru a hallway around to the front- a bit odd and far if you are handicapped.
The first visit we sat on the patio on a weekend, it was busy but I have seen longer waits where the service was faster in other places. The waitress was overwhelmed and kept complaining to every table about how she had no help, etc. If you can't cut it have a different job! Our food took at least 45 minutes to arrive, it was getting hot out, insanely loud kids, waitress spilled drinks, food not very good, so.....
After about 4 months we ventured back, about 10:15 on a Wednesday, not busy, table inside where it is cool. It is clean and decorated with a western theme but if you do not like to eat while looking at dead animals on the wall, don't go. It doesn't bother me, but I know there are people who do not like it.
I had iced tea and a western/denver omelet with the country potatoes. The omelet was ok, but the bell peppers and onions are not sauteed first so they are pretty raw in the omelet. The amount of ham was good. The potatoes were described as sauteed with onion and bell pepper- perfect, I love that! Well, as you can see in most pictures, they are baked or microwaved, but not sauteed. They were very dry and mushy on the inside, I had 1 speck of bell pepper, but honestly I think it rolled out of the omelet and a couple teeny specks of onion. The flavorless, dry mushy potatoes stayed on my plate. Oh, I was offered biscuits (plural) or a variety of toast, I chose raisin toast. I have never been to a restaurant that gives you only 1, count it, 1 slice of toast. For the price this was not a good value and I will NEVER return!
While the service was friendly and efficient this time, it does not make up for the very mediocre food!
I can get food this good at I-Hop or Village Inn which are in the area or, my preference, the Cracker Barrel which has great service and the food is definitely better!"}
{"text":"We decided to try someplace new for our weekly breakfast out as a family, and I'm so happy we went to Lone Spur Cafe. 
Our server, Michelle, was awesome! We had our two toddlers with us, and she engaged them from the get-go, which is huge for us. She got our older daughter some stickers to play with, and they even had a saddle bag up front with goodies in it that the kids got to pick from. She mentioned that it's a very family-oriented business, and that was very clear in how the kids were treated as guests, not just accessories of their parents. I love it when businesses embrace kids!
The food was also top-notch, and arrived to the table quickly. I had the Eggs Benedict, and loved their thick, buttery Hollandaise sauce. Their breakfast potatoes were also very good. My husband had a skillet meal that looked great, and I stole a bite of his toast with house-made jam, that was seriously soooo good. 
The service, food, and atmosphere at Lone Spur were all great, and we will definitely make a return trip in the future to try some of their other offerings! A big THANK YOU to the management and staff for creating such an awesome family environment!"}
{"text":"it was good better then any chain the service was friendly but slow I had the veggie omelet that was grate my wife had waffles was not good to soggy over all good will be back for the eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"We chose to eat here because they had four stars.  However, we will not come back.  The service was horrible.  We had to wait over 30 minutes for our food and the plates were not right and my food was cold.  Apparently other guests were not being seated right away because the kitchen was backed up."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's real fresh food prepared like a 5 star restaurant. I had the French toast special and my husband had the Huevos Rancheros. Both of us were extremely happy with the food and service. Jess was our waitress and she kept our coffee cups filled. She was very pleasant and a good representation of the company.  I almost didn't want to write this review in hopes we could keep this place a secret."}
{"text":"We went here this morning for breakfast and it was OK. The Top Sirloin was good, as was the Build your own Omelet. The Country Potatoes were deep fried and tasteless, but the shredded hash browns were pretty good. Their gravy wasn't bad, but I've had better. We would probably go back and try something different next time."}
{"text":"I am saddened to hear how restaurant owner closed down letting go 30 something employees & management with no notice very sad day for all whom worked there & guests too The food was very good when I was out there recently I feel terrible for everyone who worked there"}
{"text":"I have always liked this place as the food and service has always been good. Unfortunately I cannot return here after this Mothers Day. My family took my wife here to eat. The food was fine as well as the service except for the water.  It may come across as petty but three of us at the table took a drink of the water and it was horrible. I'm not talking about sink water taste but there was some kind of chemicals in our water. Fortunately for my wife and daughter-n-law they had a small sip and noticed it right at the time I took a big gulp. I've never tasted anything like it and I have no way to describe the taste. After about 30 minutes my lymph nodes started swelling and whatever it was made me sick. I asked for the Manager and a young woman came out to speak with me. I explained the issue and she apologized and then asked if I'd like to speak with the manager. I told her that's who I asked for to begin with. It didn't go any further and we left. I went home and took a charcoal drink which helped tremendously. Not a good experience.  Be careful if you dare."}
{"text":"We've eaten here upwards of 10 times and reach time the experience gets a little worse. We came for breakfast and were not greeted when we came,  the 3 ladies at the hostess stand kept talking and sighing about some dispute over sections.  Finally,  a server came and told us we could sit at the bar, we then waited 7, yes 7, minutes to be acknowledged at the small bar. I'm not sure why we kept getting ignored,  but it was so awkward that the couple who was leaving made a comment to their server that we'd been waiting to order coffee. Finally,  another server came out and apologized,  clearly annoyed that we had been ignored and proceeded to take good care of us.  When our server wasn't at the bar,  we were ignored, even when our glasses needed filling. I'm unsure of what was going on."}
{"text":"Soooo good! We pass this place all the time and decided to finally try it. Portions were big at a good price!"}
{"text":"Stopped by this place after driving by many times and thought I'd give it a shot. It's your regular western-themed restaurant, lots of memorabilia yup the point of looking cluttered. I ordered coffee and the chorizo skillet. Do you know how hard it is to stir your coffee with no spoon? I asked my waitress for a set-up and cream and got the cream but nothing to stir! I finally got my utensils JUST before my food and half my coffee, which was now cold, was gone. No refill. Oh wait! I DID get a coffee refill. When I was done! :::sigh::: 
As for the food? It IS forgettable. The chorizo had no flavor, no kick. The home fries? Meh. And you only get ONE slice of bread for your toast. The apricot marmalade was good. But I think I'll stay home and make my own thank you."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and the service was fast. The employees were welcoming and friendly. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast, sat outside, and had a great experience! I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and loved it! I finished my entire plate and enjoyed every bite. The potatoes were really delicious and I loved the beans, even though I'm not a huge bean person!"}
{"text":"Why do I give this place 5 stars? I work in the industry and here's why I rated it the way I did. As I walked into the store I noticed the music was appropriate and at a pleasant level. I was impressed with the cleanliness and presentation of the staff. I sat at the bar top and was greeted right away by Jess. Beverage immediately placed in front of me and order taken in a timely manner. I ordered the chicken fried steak with home style potatoes along with biscuits and gravy. Order arrived in a timely manner and definitely gave me the \"wow\" effect! The presentation and portion size was generous so say the least. The quality of the food and temperate and taste was spot on! I also enjoy that there has always been a managers presence on the floor. I could NOT eat all of the goodness placed in front of me and my final tab was under $15. I keep on coming back for the great food and service."}
{"text":"Was there this morning about 10:30, the wait was a little long about 45 minutes, they really need more room there no interior seating for waiting. After being seated food was about 30 minutes. Food was ok, eggs were cold, hash browns cold, gravy warm, biscuit warm, my soda was good and cold. 
IMO they seem to be short handed, food was prolly made in a mass due to labor shortage. Would like to go back but I will have to stick to Peoria Cafe or Hay Makers for now."}
{"text":"HUGE portions. Delicious food.  Line out the door on weekend mornings, for good reason. This space was a failed bar many times over before finding its calling as EXACTLY what was missing from this area of town: a homestyle, neighborhood cafe.
I've gone here for breakfast several times, and I can say that I have never ordered an entree that hasn't exceeded my expectations. My husband is partial to the burrito, while sometimes at night I lie awake and dream about the pancakes.
My only complaint, if any, is that the space isn't large enough to meet the need..... but I guess that says something about how the clientele feels about this little gem. 
Also, my sisters think the Bloody Marys could use a little more booze.... but hey, easy fix. :)"}
{"text":"Should rename it lone star. This place is terrible. Slow service and really bad food.  Took the kids to see Santa and were starving so we gave this place a shot. 

I had the cowboy Benedict, my wife had an omelet, and the boy had a pancake. Everything was just bad. It took forever and a day to get the food. Then they serve us this slop. 

Stop, no, and don't. 

Come to think of it. There really aren't any options in this strip mall. They should rename it as well. Park Waste better sums it up. They should keep the theater and tear the rest down."}
{"text":"Wow! We tried this place on a busy Sunday morning. We were seated promptly, the waitress was friendly and never stood still the entire time we were there; yet she was still attentive to our needs(refills!). The food was absolutely delicious and the serving sizes were plenty! If you are really hungry, they have \"Cowboy size\" which is even bigger! 
Rustic West décor. Great prices. Definitely add this place to your go-to spots. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First time visit! Brought my Mom here today for breakfast and wow were we surprised! The food was fabulous, portions perfect, ( okay a little large ) and the service exceptional! Why we hesitated visiting is beyond me. We highly recommend everyone stop by. We can't wait to try lunch and dinner!"}
{"text":"So 830 am this morning , got on waiting list ... took about 15 mins , was seated and then the  real wait began..... waited literally 15 mins and finally got acknowledged by the waitress with a \" I will be write with you when I can\" comment..... wanted another 15 minutes ..... another waitress decided to take our drink orders and then our original waitress stated again \" I will be with you when I can\" ..... would have got up and left but had others with us ...... anther 10 mins drinks came ... anther 10 mos order taken .... and 20 mins later food showed up ..... waitresses excuse was \" sorry but I had a couple tables on the other side of the room\". The place was busy ...not slammed . 
Poor excuse, Poor Service, And it reflects on poor management. 
The Amount of Time it took to seat and serve us , you literally could have turned those tables over with business 3 times. 
 Suggestions : 
  Get experienced wait staff, for a Saturday it was like dealing with a new waitress ....
Lose the \" I only do one job \" model ..... waitresses wait, bus boys bus , food handlers bring food ... it doesn't work and does not reflect a team effort .... I saw multiple employees pass by tables with dirty dishes ...but it wasn't there job..... your losing money ...
The food was ok .... , everyone serves breakfast ..but it's the service that makes the breakfast ..... good luck ...won't be returning or recommending any time soon."}
{"text":"We moved to the area recently and had been wanting to try this place as it always seems busy.  Definatly happy we did.  Good food, friendly staff and great atmosphere. We will be back....probably often!"}
{"text":"They're coffee is fantastic and their bacon is the finest tastiest cut I've had the pleasure of bitting into! Seriouslyn its thick cut and so delicious! And its not fake thick cut where it would only be considered thick next to a piece of paper, nah, they're a nice hunk to eat!

Katie was my server and was a ray of sunshine! I had the belgum waffle with eggs and bacon with some coffee. Lone Spur cafe is also a fantastic pokestop given there are three pokespots within the diners range!"}
{"text":"I posted a review yesterday, and it seems to have disappeared. Hmm.
One star. Lousy service. Incredibly lousy food. Bland, boring, tasteless breakfast. First time there, will not be returning.  Heck, the Royal Cafe is better than this place, and that's not saying much.  $28 I will never get back. What a waste of time and money."}
{"text":"An overwhelming amount of barely cooked onions. I love the location of Lone Spur. It fills a vacuum of breakfast places for morning family  meetups. This is why I come every two weeks. However, I have yet to find a meal that I will order again. I am beginning to wonder if I should just order a biscuit and gravy which is tasty. 

What is a mystery is that Lone Spur begins their meals with wonderful fresh ingredients. However, they do not cook their onions long enough before folding them into the country potatoes and their egg dishes. If you love raw onions, this will not bother you. However, the flavor of the under-cooked onion overpowers many dishes. I had the cowboy scramble and my poor eggs and spinach were uneatable due to those offending onions. I gingerly picked out my onions from both the eggs and country potatoes which were beautifully seasoned and fried this time if sans onions. 

I enjoy so many aspects of Lone Spur and really, really want to come back and enjoy full breakfast meals here. In a week, I shall come back and try the chicken fried steak. I hope that I won't have to pick out under-cooked onions."}
{"text":"Started out not good and ended even worse. Could not substitute any items on the menu, my eggs were cold and my coffee was empty most of the time.  When asked to speak to the manager they sent someone else to talk to us.  Needless to say way too many other great restaurants in the valley.  The food was just okay and the service was terrible.  I almost forgot the table was dirty when we were seated."}
{"text":"This place is dialed in!  I have had Breakfast twice and lunch one time. Everything we have eaten is very good. The pancakes are the best ever, breakfast burrito over the top, steaks are cooked perfect and Mara the server we had today is extremely attentive. My wife said we should make it more of a habit to here. Ha ha. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Service isn't any better here than it is in Prescott. And it's very noisy. I think this is our first and last stop here."}
{"text":"Went here before the farmers market for some breakfast and the food served was semi cold. Country potatoes weren't cooked all the way, cold gravy and microwaved biscuits. I like the location and patio seating as well as big servings they provide, \"cowboy size\" and big portions are hard to find for breakfast these days so that was awesome. Staff was nice but our waitress  Michelle seemed very flustered, which they were busy but this seemed to make a few customers uncomfortable along with my party. I would give it another try next time in the area but sort of hesitant."}
{"text":"This is the place! Best breakfast I've encountered so far on the west side. First off, we were greeted right away as soon as we came through the door. Our waitress, Cassidy was super nice. She had allot of tables to take care but manage to be very professional and apologetic about the wait but we didn't even waited that long. 
The food arrived really early! It was fresh and very warm. You can already tell that the food was prepared very well. I got the chicken fried steak and it was so good! The gravy had little chunks of sausages and that tasted so well together. I also tried my friend chorizo and it was also the best thing ever. I will definitely come back here again. The location was very easy to find. Love this place!"}
{"text":"It has great atmosphere but the food we ordered took 25 minutes ! My potatoes too done and bacon was chewy. Our waitress didn't stop by and refill our drinks in timely manner. 
Won't be back but ok to at least try once."}
{"text":"Great service! Waitress Jamie was very attentive; she kept our drinks topped off. They were busy, but she made sure her tables were taken care of. The food came timely , and just they way they were order. One little mistake, but it was taken care of immediately. Will be returning soon."}
{"text":"Portions are HUGE!! Food is so delicious and fresh!! Service was nice and friendly!! My only complaint was that the waitress didn't tell us how huge the wagon wheel pancake was and my kids each ordered one when they could have shared. WILL BE BACK AGAIN!! LOVE IT!! YEEHAW!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is AMAZING!  My wife and I discovered it on accident and we are glad we did. I ordered the ribeye and eggs and my steak was perfectly cooked medium rare by the kitchen. The pancakes were out of this world also. Our server was Mara and she was on top of things. The chef stepped out to ask us how things were and you could tell that he took a tremendous amount of pride in the quality of the food her served his guests. We will definitely be back. 

Thanks."}
{"text":"First time there was Sunday with my pops and sis. Great experience from the staff and very tasty food. The place was packed but it was a quick 20 minutes. Kendall up front did a great job of staying on top of it. She said 20 minute wait and it was. So they already started off like pros. Christina, our server was on her game to. I was in the restaurant biz so I know what to look for and appreciate these type of things when a restaurant is ran well. Breakfast was fantastic and can't wait to order lunch soon!! Hats off to the owners and staff and I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Big portions, great service, and bomb food. Definitely coming back soon. Phoenix Foodies Approved!"}
{"text":"Second time coming to this place and this will be the last! The first time I went my party of 6 was skipped over so a waitress could serve her family that was a party of 5. When I complained about the instance the manager offered a free breakfast. It took me 4 months to even want to come back for a free breakfast. I brought my daughter and granddaughter this last time and the server was slow and when I tried to utilize my free breakfast card I was told it goes towards the lower meal cost which I understand (difference of 2$ for both meals) and that the check could not be split to cover my meal. (Yet I was not asked if we wanted separate checks) Courtney my server made it seem like she was doing a favor for me by splitting the check very rudely. But when I asked for the manager she was quick to explain she's not supposed to split the check but will do it anyway to \"avoid confrontation\". I will not be back to this restaurant after another bad experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times. Service seems to get slow every time we come. I know we come while it is busy but the long waits to get our drinks, put in our order, coffee refills, and to get and pay our check. The food was delicious as always. My boyfriend got his usual the cowboy Benedict. I got the French toast special. There are never any complaints about the food."}
{"text":"Our first visit to Lone Spur Cafe was OK. I give only three stars because: there was only one server working the entire floor which had a negative impact on service despite her working very hard; the food as just OK... my eggs were definitely not-to-order, the skillet didn't appear or taste to be freshly prepared; the pancake was chewy, however the bacon was delicious. Cost was 15 percent above our local average for breakfast, although Lone Spur Cafe does have some excellent coupon specials.  Unfortunately, we will not be back."}
{"text":"Saturday was my first time there. My friend and I had breakfast. Food was good and service was also good, my complaint was the wait time for our food. Seriously it took longer for the food to show up to our table that it did to wait for the said table. We had a 10 minute wait to be seated when we got there but I swear it was a good 45 minutes or more to get our food. I felt for the waitress cuz she was the one who had to deliver the food to everyone and probably received an earful. I agree with Gayla B, don't go if you are in a hurry!!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday night. It's seems like a clean cute little western restaurant. The staff seem friendly.  But the good vibes stop there. I ordered a steak, rice pilaf, mixed veggies, salad and it came with bread. Well, if you are looking to pay $20.00 for microwave bagged rice, an overdone steak, and veggies that look black and inedible this would be the place for you to eat. This place might be clean and cute but I really don't want to pay that much for a steak when I can pay less and go to Texas Roadhouse where the food is edible and my steak is done right!"}
{"text":"This is fantastic food. HUGE portions....I would call it cowboy style food. Biscuits and gravy as big as the plate. Wonderful place and great service."}
{"text":"MEH! It seemed like it COULD be a cool place. I liked the style and  the staff was friendly, however the food was just so-so...
I had a chicken sandwich today for lunch and the chicken was really dry... The French fries that came with them were nothing special. Not bad, just normal. The server was nice but not fast. They weren't very busy and the food took a while to come out, probably because they were over cooking it, also  had to ask for refills... I'll definitely be back to give them another chance because it seems like it could be a cool place if they work out the kinks..."}
{"text":"The corned beef and eggs were great and the service was terrific.  A Phoenix version of the Prescott restaurant that won't disappoint.  I'll admit that I'm hard to please for breakfast, but Lone Spur Cafe is a new favorite.  Two tips:  hash browns aren't served after 11:00 am, so get here early if your a fan and the toast comes already buttered - if you're like me you just need to ask for it dry with butter on the side."}
{"text":"While we can only speak to the breakfast here, I am so glad that we finally gave this place a try. The biscuits and gravy are heavenly. The eggs are hot and fresh and you get a choice between links or patties on the sausage! It doesn't get better! 

The service is friendly and fast, the portions are good size without being ridiculous, and the food is super good. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We were greeted by loud, obnoxious, and rude hostesses. The services was very slow and the food was like warm at best."}
{"text":"The food here is always so good and today was no different except for the fact that I ended up having a hair in my food which was gross but I wasn't going to make a scene about it. I simply addressed the server to let her know what had happened, I believe her name was Chelsea. I lifted up my plate to show her the hair and she leans over the counter and says \"next time I ask how your food is, tell me.\"  When she had never checked in on us and I had not seen the hair yet which is fine I understand it's a busy place but what I don't understand is snapping at someone who wasn't even being rude. As a fellow server I was surprised she would ever talk to a customer that way. She didn't even apologize until I decided to ask to talk to management. And it just completely ruined the experience which is such a bummer."}
{"text":"This review is about the food. The waitress was extremely nice, the manager checks up on costumers. In fact i wouod consider coming back ONLY for their staff and their manners.

The food however is another story. It was great food it really was if you're not health conscious. I ordered the huevos rancheros. They had bacon, cheese, MORE bacon, and on top of that sour cream. I asked for none of that but ended up with about a cup of sour cream on them. I'm Mexican and never in my life have I eaten such unhealthy and bad food. Now I feel sick and nauseous. I didn't even finish the food. I only ate half of it. I could tell the beans and the salsa came from a can. It just isn't a place where a health conscious person can find anything to eat.

On the plus side? The hashbrowns were pretty good and the eggs were cooked well. Over all I would've given this place 5 stars if the food wasn't so cheaply made but to each his own. If you enjoy those types of breakfast dishes then try this place because the staff is certainly good."}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time here.First time was not good,but we came back because of how well we were treated.This time was much better.Food was good and our server Kimberley was fantastic.Hopefully the good food and great service will continue."}
{"text":"SERVICE SUCKS (thumbs down ) 
 My waitress was not friendly at all, and clueless of things I asked for as if it was her first day on the job, food took 30 min to get from the time I placed the order, that is unacceptable, with so many restaurant choices out there, this is by far rediculous amount of time to wait, and the food isn't great either.. I told my wife maybe it worth this long wait, yea right very disappointed, DO NOT get the \"country potato\" they suck. The burrito was cold and nasty, there salsa in the burrito had a bitter taste to it, HIRE FRIENDLY EMPLOYEES, because after my experience today,  I will NOT be going back to eat here, it's better ho the road to Cracker Barrel"}
{"text":"Super bummed!!!  I was really hoping to have a great breakfast place near me.  The place looks great!!!  That's the most positive thing about it.  

Service was ok.  coffee refills took longer than it should.  She even apologized.  It wasn't that busy.

Quality was sub-par!   My eggs were not cooked properly.  I asked for over easy and they were over cooked!  The country potatoes looked amazing, but as soon as I took a bite I was so disappointed!!!  Absolutely no flavor at all!!!

Cleanliness was great except for my silverware was dirty.

Value.  $2.49 for one flour tortilla!!!  Way overpriced!  The portions are great if you ask for the cowboy size.

So, overall I was disappointed.  Bummer!!!"}
{"text":"Our least favorite b-fast spot of our spring break trip this  week.  Everything sadly fell short of expectations.  The biscuits didn't seem house prepared and if they were they need to re-evaluate them.  The gravy had one piece of sausage in it and everything just seemed to be luke warm and not freshly prepared.  The service was friendly but very few other positives to gain from this visit.  We would probably skip this place next time.  D."}
{"text":"We have been here twice both for breakfast and dinner. The food is great the staff is attentive and courteous."}
{"text":"This is my first time here and I must say I was not impressed. It wasn't busy which surprised me the service was so slow. When Christina my server finally took my order I thought things were getting better but I was wrong. It took just as long to get my food. My eggs were over cooked and my the time she brought my toast (which I had to ask for) my food was cold. Don't think I will be coming back"}
{"text":"In Phoenix area again...found my New favorite breakfast spot, great quality & portions.  Dining area was very comfortable and clean (clean bathrooms too).  Staff was friendly, helpful, & attentive. Ate there 3 times during my 10 day visit."}
{"text":"Chelsey Murray was a great server. Everything she recommended was on point. Good food and drink."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was good, except for my toast, it came out burnt, and was the heel of the loaf."}
{"text":"Wife, me, and kids all agree this was a successful breakfast experience. Was seated quickly, food was awesome and kids got \"saddle back\" toy. Recommend trying it out"}
{"text":"This is actually my second time visiting and the food is delicious. The portion is huge! I had the Cowboy Meat Lovers Skillet and it was pretty satisfying. Bacon, sausage, and ham with choice of hash browns or home potatoes and 2 eggs; covered in gravy. I chose the home potatoes which has red bell peppers and onions so the combination was so delicious. I also got a biscuit and gravy instead of toast. All and all a great breakfast."}
{"text":"Sometimes a visit transcends a rating based upon a simple factor. This visit won our hearts on the friendliness and kindness of service. From the minute we entered, the staff was always there to make a positive touch on the moment.  There is a lot of value in smiles, friendliness and timely service. Think of all the times when the food was great but service was brutal. 

Food wise, the portions were large and the food quality was above board. But the menu lacked creativity, any healthy option and offered every standard dish you've ever had. So my companion was totally at a loss because she looks for healthy options, not big cowboy portions. In that sense, it wasn't a balanced menu. I will say the biscuits and especially the sausage gravy were top notch (must try).  Other than that it was \"meets expectations\".  

We Won't be hurrying back, but for those that seek conservative breakfast options in large portions or just want to smother your body in awesome country sausage gravy...I would recommend Lone Spur.  Kudos to management for hiring a great staff."}
{"text":"Had 15 in our party, had to wait for another large party to finish (no biggie) waited about 20 minutes then they left and all that was left on the tables were a few coffee cups and water cups, they continued to seat smaller party after smaller party, the one table that they needed to add for our party they sat 2 people at, they still did not bus the big table, the hostess enjoyed watching us wait while she continued to seat people that were here after us, we left after a 45 minute wait, and they still never attempted to bus the table as they saw us leave, apparently they do not need to provide any type of customer service unless they can seat you right away.  Be careful lone spur, you will someday realize that you should treat all your customers the same. There are many other places to eat around the area, we can give our large party business to someone else,. And if you (the hostess) are to good to bus a table to get the party seated you are either in the wrong business or should enroll in a class on customer service.
Never again."}
{"text":"I don't know if this is a thing now for restaurants to do on Mother's Day but if it is it's a great practice; this is the second time this has happened to us at a restaurant. 
Because of the holiday today, my mother and any other mother got gifted a rose during breakfast and it's such a wonderful gesture. Of course breakfast was delicious as usual and since we were sitting outside it was wonderfully comfortable. There was a little worry at first since we asked to sit outside and the hostess gave us our menus and directed us to go pick a spot, so we weren't sure if the waitress would actually be made aware we were there, but she had arrived and taken our drink orders in less than five minutes after we had settled ourselves into our seats! She was so pleasant and accommodating! It's no wonder my mother likes to come here almost every weekend! With everything the way it is I don't blame her one bit."}
{"text":"I was seated immediately.  Looked at the menu and was ready to order.  Problem,  no one wanted to take my order.  Waited over 5 minutes.  No water, no coffee, nothing .  Two servers looked in my directions but didn't come by.  I left.  No food is good enough when the service is this bad.  To make matters worse, it was my birthday."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this morning. Was very impressed with the service and food. Got a waffle and bacon and eggs. First time a place has cooked my bacon perfect the first time. Amazing!!! Kids loved the kids meals and at the end they let you pick out a prize In The saddle bag, which my kids loved."}
{"text":"So upset with our breakfast today. We used to crave Lone Spur but it has been progressively been going down. Our scrambled eggs, bacon and waffle were clearly already cooked and just waiting for a customer. Between the three meals ordered all were look warm if not almost cold. The water tastes like absolute dirt, you must buy a beverage. Probably won't come here again. Servers are nice when around. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I would give it more of a 3.5 stars. Went here for breakfast on a Saturday. It was not very busy and we were seated immediately. The place itself is very cute! Their decor was fun and clean. The coffee was good. We ordered the southwest omelet with hash browns and Biscuits and gravy and the chicken fried steak with home style potatoes and biscuits and gravy. Everything was huge and we ended up taking half home. The omelet had guacamole and chorizo and peppers. It was good, but the chorizo was not very flavorful. It had kind of a muddled flavor. The chicken fried steak was good. It had sausage gravy on it which had big chunks of sausage. The sausage was very soft and the gravy was very salty. It was good but I would like the sausage to be smaller and cooked more. The biscuits and gravy had the same sausage gravy and a pretty good biscuit. The bill came to about $22. The waitress said she could swipe our card to pay right there with her iPad thing, but then had to go run and get the receipt from somewhere else, so we thought that was funny. Overall, everything was good but had something we would change for each item. We will be back since it's close to our house but I don't think I'd go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times now.  good atmosphere, but the location can be a turn off because of the parking situation.  The staff is very friendly.  chicken fried steak is pretty awesome, very tender.  the breakfast burrito was good, but the salsa they use is awful.  tastes like something out of a can.  overall a good breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall, The food would have been great, but the salad is what cost them a star and an ok review.  Staff was really friendly, clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Wow... breakfast was so good! Your omelette was spectacular, the biscuit and gravy was very very good, love their coffee and a plus is they had real half-and-half and sweet and low!! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have visited a few times now. The first time our intentions were to go somewhere else but the wait was too long. We're happy it was or we would have never found this place. We're told their breakfast is the star serving hours, but we haven't made it yet for breakfast. The dinners are what keeps us going back. The portions are huge and the flavors are amazing. I hope I get there soon for breakfast."}
{"text":"I was in on Sunday supreme 4th and Michelle was our server. She wad so adorable and tiny I wanted to keep her in my pocket. I came for breakfast with my family and she made our visit soooooooooo enjoyable. She suggested that I try the chorizo scramble and it wad perfect. The spur cream and green onions made it that much better. I will definitely be returning for the heart food and our server Michelle."}
{"text":"Our new great place to eat. Stopped by spur of the moment and couldnt believe how good it was. Service and food were excellent. Owner was there and very concerned that everyone received the best service. We will definitely be back soon. AAA +"}
{"text":"Great keto options for breakfast. Cowboy cheese omelette, bacon, avocado, and sour cream. Their cottage cheese is skim, though. Parking can be a bit tough."}
{"text":"This place screams the rustic west. Very clean and new inside with beautiful western decor. It is the perfect venue to bring those from out of town and give them a taste of AZ.

Then is built in Cowboy fashion and lends you the ability to choose cowboy portions. 

I had the eggs and pork chop. My chop was perfect with a light char flavor that made it fantastic! The whole experience was awesome and the staff courteous and efficient.

More on the Westside than the east. It is a great option if you are heading to San Diego or Buckeye area as it is right off of the 101. 

I highly reccomend a stop in here. The breakfast special menu is a great value if you can get in before 8am. Check them out!

{"text":"Terrible! My husband ordered huevos rancheros and the meal consisted of mostly out of the can food sitting on top of plain corn tortillas! I ordered the French toast and they were raw in the middle. If you have had good Mexican food at other places this is not the place to come to! This is American wanna be Mexican flair place!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly, great service! They have an amazing breakfast menu we are definitely going to check out. They seem to really care about their customers."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic opens up super early best breakfast within miles I totally take this over Cracker Barrel Village in IHOP all the other breakfast places nearby., I've had chicken fried steak I've had the eggs over easy have great hash browns they do a good job with her home fries they have pretty good french toast coffee is decent nothing bad to say about this waitresses are friendly"}
{"text":"Visited this past weekend for Spring Training Decided to Try this place out they have Delicious Breakfast, everything on the menu looked amazing! Try the Joes Scramble(ground beef scrambled with eggs, mushroom, onion, cheese)  I really enjoyed it, with a great cup of Coffee. Very friendly staff although 45 minutes to receive our food was a bit too long."}
{"text":"I was visiting family in Arizona over a Holiday weekend and my grandfather decided to take us to this restaurant which appeals to it's older pre-Sun City inhabitants who love big portions and eating is their favorite hobby. Noted.

Now we went late, 11:30AM so their morning rush had just ended and they were transitioning into lunch, there weren't that many people seated. Our waitress seemed flustered, as if we had inconvenienced her by sitting in her section because she was so busy with the empty seats surrounding us. Her body language translated into me having to go up and ask for a coffee refill from the bar staff two times due to feeling uncomfortable asking. Obviously I don't mind doing this because I am young and have a lot of energy and circulation but if I was older and with a heart condition or an oxygen tank this could be an issue I suppose.

Then my food came out and it was not what I ordered, which I was actually surprised because so rarely does bad service mean bad food (usually one thing is at least right!) So they re made it really quickly and gave me what I ordered with a side of cold hash browns. I asked if they could heat them up and the manager took them back then they dropped the check immediately after! I'm hoping those hash browns went to someone, because I sure didn't get a bite of em!"}
{"text":"The hostess couldn't predict wait time but thought 30min. 45min we were sat into one of the many empty tables. The reasoning behind the many empty table is the couple \"large.\" Parties of 6-8. We get seated and already know what we want and wait another 20min to order as the waitress runs around. We see several waiters argue about table numbers while walking around with food so it wasn't surprising ours was cold. Giving it a one star is being generous. Now as I type review my empty cup has been sitting on the side of the table for 5min, we are done eating and we were never asked how our food was."}
{"text":"We found our new breakfast place! Very friendly staff, clean and good food! Really liked the coffee and BACON!! OMG, I'd come back just for a plate of bacon-it's not that cheap Denny's crap! I had the Huevos Rancheros w/hash browns and my friend had the Bacon & Egg breakfast w/hash browns and sliced tomatoes instead of toast. So good!"}
{"text":"i was very disappointed in the service. our waitress dropped our food off at our table without bothering to even ask if everything looked okay. we asked for dry toast but we weren't offered any jelly. we got a potato skillet but had asked for A LOT of veggies and added a few others that didn't come with the meal. the extra veggies we ordered aren't there and the \"A LOT\" of veggies i asked for weren't either. we're vegan and asked for the meal to be altered for this reason. the meal came out looking rather sad. the veggies cost .79 EACH and we didn't even get what we had requested. i stopped eating to wait for the waitress to come back so i could tell her. 15 mins and she still had not come to check on us. i understand being busy on a saturday morning but what we asked for, we didn't get..."}
{"text":"We visited on a Sunday morning about 11 am.  There was a bit of a wait and we were standing near the door.  The young hostess was being chewed out by a waitress and was visibly upset (even tearful at one point).  Another employee (at the hostess stand) tried to calm her and get her working again but she was not a happy camper.

Turns out in the middle of all of that our name never got on the list.   We did finally get seated and coffee came pretty quickly.   I ordered the Joe's Special, potatoes, a side of bacon and sourdough toast.  The onions, mushrooms, and spinach in my eggs were barely cooked.  The onions were still crisp.  The potatoes were very hard and could have used more cooking as well.  The bacon was very limp.  My friend had over easy eggs, potatoes, and a biscuit with gravy.    She felt the biscuit was hard and the gravy lukewarm.

I would have rather waited another 5 minutes for better cooked food than getting undercooked food fast.

Sadly, I don't think we'll be going again."}
{"text":"Very good food, friendly staff, at an affordable price. Enjoyed cowboy benedict which was biscuit and gravy loaded with an added touch of ham and eggs. It was very good and super filling. Daughter had chicken tenders of course. Tenders were large and fries had nice seasoning. All around a good experience."}
{"text":"Giving one star only because the food was decent. Other than that this place is a joke. Missed a movie because the food took over an hour and the waitress was clueless. If I wasnt so hungry I would have walked out. The owner needs to go in there and see the employees they have working there. Terrible experience"}
{"text":"Very happy with my experience at lone spur cafe. The food was great and the service is quick. It is a nice place to sit down and enjoy breakfast with a coffee. I will definitely be coming back and trying their dinner menu on Fridays and Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Very friendly and attentive! The food was over the top! Amazing flavor and the portions were huge! And don't even get me started on the homemade strawberry jam! The sourdough toast was fluffy and tasty. This is definitely our new favorite breakfast place! We will be back again and again! So many good things on the menu to try!!"}
{"text":"Best Country Gravy. Mmm 
Good service, decent food and prices. 
This is our first visit but we will be back. 
They even serve grits! Which the hubby loves"}
{"text":"Updating: Since my review bellow the District Manager has been in touch with me and has been very kind to look into this. I have changed my stars from 1 to 3 for this. It is nice to know managers are taking pride in their locations and doing what they can to make it better.
--------------
Not sure how this place has as many stars as it does. Was hoping this was like the Lone Spur in Prescott. Same menus but totally different experience. Cannot cook eggs properly, (gave me literally a raw egg and then burnt when sent back)  meat portions are MUCH smaller than the other one and service was mediocre at best! We will not be back!"}
{"text":"The food here is very good. Decided to head to this brunch spot with my girlfriend and my buddy after seeing it pop up on Yelp. The size of the restaurant is quite small which is deceiving as the exterior is rather large. We sat on the patio outside. 

The service was very good as our waitress was attentive and checked on us quite often. The prices are a bit on the higher end but the quantity and quality of the food is worth the price. I ordered a Joe's scramble and was not disappointed. They biscuits were flaky and the gravy had nice sized chunks of sausage. My buddy had the brisket Benedict where they initially overlooked the eggs. Our waitress got that fixed and the second attempt was perfect. The strawberry jam is quite tasty and is worth it. 

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Chelsea is wonderful and very accommodating. Food and service was superb despite being Saturday morning. If you order an omelet be sure and ask for real eggs."}
{"text":"I have been there a few times now.  Good selection of breakfast items.  I have had the omelettes made to order... They are super cheesy!  I had the steak breakfast.  So far everything is good.  The service is good too.  Just nothing wowed me."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in for breakfast after checking out the local farmers market nearby.
It's a nice cafe, tastefully decorated with a cowboy western theme.
Our hostess was friendly and seated us immediately at a table near their patio. Our waitress was friendly and brought us out coffee with creamer. She gave us time to peruse the menu before returning to take our order.
My husband chose the wagon wheel breakfast consisting of an enormous, oversized buttermilk pancake with warm maple syrup, scrambled eggs and thick cut bacon.
I chose the ham scramble with home fries and sourdough toast; they serve it with fresh made preserves. 
Everything was melt in your mouth goodness with deliciousness in every bite. 
They were busy when we were there as this cafe open for breakfast and lunch, appears to be a popular place to go.
We will return in the near future to try more of their delights!"}
{"text":"First and last time here. I had the BBQ sandwich it was terrible I could only eat about half of it. 
When the waitress came for the check and asked if I need a box. I said NO IT was terrible she ignored me."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant based on the reviews. My husband and I went today around 10:30am and got s table right away. From recommendations from the reviews on Yelp we got one pancake to share, my husband got the ham steak and eggs with a biscuit and gravy and I got bacon and eggs with toast. I will say that the pancake was really good! That was about it. Potatoes were dry, bacon was hard, the ham steak was so small, and my husband has had better biscuits and gravy. One star was for the pancake and the other was for our server. She was good. The food was very average and seemed very sloppy. Not to mention one table behind us got up and walked out due to no service and the one next to us was fed up with the service and waiting that they left a twenty on the table and left before they finished their food. There are just better breakfast places"}
{"text":"Best breakfast and most friendly waitress in years. I had the veggie omelet and added chorizo...it was scrumptious! Hash Browns were crispy, just like I like them. Quite a find!!"}
{"text":"This is our third time coming here and the food came out fast and the owner came out and ask us how the food was and it was really really good we are so full right now but will becoming back oh and the staff are very friendly and they are beginning to know us"}
{"text":"We've gone to this place for breakfast a couple of times.  Love, love, love the bacon! The decor is fun Western style.  The employees are friendly and interested in their customers.  I'd definitely go there again!!"}
{"text":"Don't come here if you're in a hurry. 

I have been here several times because it's close to our house. The food is ok and the portions are large for the price. The staff is nice enough and it's comfortable seating.  They are normally a little slower than other breakfast places.

But this last time we visited it took almost an hour to get hour food. 
Breakfast food does not take a long time to make. We didn't even order steaks just basic bacon and eggs.  When we finally got the food it was cold like it had been siting in the window neglected for a while."}
{"text":"Too expensive for what you get. I like the vibe of the place but honestly for what you get you are better off going somewhere else. The French Toast has a weird corn flake topping and would be better without. The steak is fatty. I have had a Rueben as well and that was not worth more than $9 but the price was closer to $12. I don't mind paying if it is amazing but not so much."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, great location.  Very few restaurants in this area outside of west gate.  French toast is amazing.  Give it A try."}
{"text":"First time here and my first impression was how clean the restaurant is and how attentive and friendly the staff was. Lots of good mornings and how are you going around. 

The food was delicious. I'm not a huge breakfast person but my omelette was on point with bacon and zucchini added in. Cheese was not greasy or over bearing and hash browns not over cooked. I will for sure come back and can't wait to try the weekend dinner."}
{"text":"Great place! Stopped by for lunch over the weekend. Had a lunch combo - the chipotle chicken wrap with french onion soup. The wrap was very basic but also tasty. The soup had bits of prime rib - yum!  The service was stellar and so quick! We got our lunch within 5 minutes of ordering. I would love to come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have been to their location several times for breakfast in Prescott and really enjoyed the food and service. I came to this location to have lunch and decided on a cheeseburger and fries. I asked for the burger to have no veggies and add mayo. The burger arrived no cheese, and no mayo. I waited a long time before the server to come back. When I told her the issue, she said nothing, walked away, and then came back with a plate with a slice of swiss cheese and a side of mayo. No apology or anything, and by this time my burger was not even warm and the cheese didn't get to melt like I would have liked. The burger was a good size and looked good, but there was no flavor at all. About 3 bites in the bun completely fell apart and I just gave up eating it and finished the fries, which were good. When the server came back I told her about the bun and she said I should just try it on toasted sourdough next time. I asked if she would let them know in the kitchen, but she said those are the buns they use, that's it. 

Not impressed with the service here at all, and would never get a burger here again. Also, they have the same prices at this location as the one in Prescott, which is in a tourist area, and prices are usually higher...But here in Phoenix at a place like this...$12.89 for nachos and $2 extra for any kind of meat, $14.89....A BLT $11...All salads $13.99....Come on...that's crazy!!"}
{"text":"Firstly, the table was soaking wet. Also the water was tap water not filtered. Terrible food, was really disappointed. I order the wagon wheel pancake which is really huge like others mentioned but it was completely burnt on the other side... the eggs were also fried in what tasted like butter flavored crisco and the whites of the egg weren't completely cooked. You can tell they have really mediocre chefs.  Just extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here this afternoon. It is a very clean and welcoming restaurant. The service was prompt, friendly, and the food came out quick. This is a great location and I will definitely be back! They have a great menu! Biscuits and gravy are delicious!"}
{"text":"I stumbled here Friday evening when I feel starving and want's to devour something. I had the vegetable omelet, served with cheese, and it was tasty, but not so great. They don't cost you that much so it was an okay experience then! Not sure if I'm coming back."}
{"text":"We finally true alone Spur Restaurant in Peoria and wow was it great. Excellent food great service and a nice clean place to eat. I can't say enough good things about this place and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout today, Egg breakfast with country potatoes and toast. Picked it up and started driving to work. Opened it and it was hash browns. Biggest saddest face ever. I was excited for those country potatoes!!!! 
Anyways called because I was upset, the girl at the front said sorry and told me to come back so I can pick up some potatoes. Well unfortunately I have work and if I had time I wouldn't be ordering takeout. 
Still upset, I called back and expressed my disappointment in seeing hash browns when I ordered country potatoes. I would say she tried to make it better by asking me to come in tomorrow to get something else. But unfortunately again life doesn't evolve around Lone Spur. 
Would I recommend? Not that it's a bad place, but it's not a great place that would make me want to spend my money on them again."}
{"text":"Thought we would give this spot another try since three other restaurants have tried and failed..maybe this one would know better. Fantastic service but if your going to charge Texas Road House prices for steak, serve quality steak!! My husband had rib eye and it was more like cheap sirloin. Water was highly chlorinated so forced to order a drink. Reviews reflect good beeakfast so maybe we'll give that a try. Not back for dinner."}
{"text":"The wait for your food at this place is insane. We have visited this place 3 times on a Sunday where the patio is barely any people and we still wait 10-15mins to get just our coffee and an additional 30-40mins for our food. Keep in mind we only order a stack of 2 pancakes and 2 orders of potatoes, that's it, what can take so long to make that order?

The problem here is, there's not enough staff to keep this restaurant keeping a good flow. 
It's really frustrating because the food is decent but the wait to get your food is terrible. I witnessed 2 ladies walking out of the restaurant because of how long they waited for their food. 

Manager and owner please fix this, get the cook some help and more waiters please."}
{"text":"Weekday breakfast special is an amazing value. Available from 6:30 - 8:00 AM. Can select 2, 3 or 4 items. I got eggs over medium, hash browns and pancakes. All delicious!"}
{"text":"Great food!   Fast service!   This was our first time at this location!   Very clean,  comfortable seats!  Chelsea was our server and she did a great job!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place today for the first time. Loved the service and the food was pretty good! Only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 was because my pancake was kind of dry but the syrup was delicious! The wait was only 15 minutes and there was a nice farmers market right near it to go browse while waiting!"}
{"text":"Great bloody Mary's. Go get you some. Good food great week are great at this very nice and loud makes you want to drink grab some breakfast excellent food"}
{"text":"Just walked out of this restaurant after waiting close to 45 minutes for no meal. The reason was that the servers iPad (pos system) wasn't working. No manager came out to clarify the problem. Only when I wanted to pay for my mimosa, that took 15 minutes to get, that I spoke to a manager. I work and manage in the bar/food industry and service like this isn't how you get guests to return. The rating is for the decor and the pictures online."}
{"text":"Perfect place for brunch outside! We went at 945 on a Sunday and were seated right away on the patio. There were many groups seated at once so it took a little longer to get out drink and food order in. Totally understandable though for a Sunday morning and the staff was very apologetic. Once we got our food order in, less thank 10 minutes later we had our food! The breakfast sandwich was amazing! Served on a pretzel roll how could it not be?! I will for sure plan on stopping back at this place my next time in town!"}
{"text":"Had Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. The high point of the experience was friendly and prompt service and big chunks of sausage in the gravy and the low point was some very over salted American fries. The Chicken Fried Steak and eggs were ok, not bad or great. Place really felt like a diner with a load but friendly ambiance."}
{"text":"Came in with my family for the first time, great customer service the server Cassidy was so nice and knowledgeable and the food was great! I got the burrito it was really good and my husband got the chorizo and eggs which was good and the gravy is AMAZING!!! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch with a coworker. The pastrami was a little fatty for my taste but still pretty good. The server was on top of it but the kitchen wait time was a bit long. The inside decor is very rustic and unique making it a western comfort casual vibe."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast on the recommendation of other yelpers. I would say this place is average at best. 

I went for the \"breakfast special\" which is a pretty good deal. I had bacon, eggs, has Browns and biscuits and gravy. The bacon was good however small and only 2 pieces. The eggs came out as ordered. The hash browns were disappointing. They tasted like they were yesterday's left overs and were hard and chewy (difficult to explain). That was a disappointment to me because I love my has Browns in the morning. The biscuits and gravy were pretty good. If I ever came back here that is probably what I would order. The coffee was ok but very weak. I love my coffee and while this was o.k, I would have loved some fresh creamer and a stronger coffee. 

The waitress who helped me (blonde with a pink stripe in her hair) wasn't too personable. Maybe it's because it was early in the morning but she wouldn't smile and every time I asked a question or needed something it felt like I was really inconveniencing her. 

Lastly, if you are above average size or feeling bloated, ask for a table instead of a booth. The booths are very tight and cramped together. Pretty uncomfortable. 

Overall this place gets 3 stars from me as I consider it your average breakfast spot. Nothing special l."}
{"text":"I don't know if we tried this place on the wrong day or not but pretty much everything went wrong. The wait to get in went over the quoted time, we had to order our food twice, and it seemed like our waitress could care less about our order and all she did was just refill drinks and stand behind the bar. Total time to get food for two people from check in was nearly 2 hours which is sad because there were 10-15 empty tables in the restaurant. The home fries were burnt to a crisp and nearly inedible. Everything food wise didn't taste that great at all. We were starving and both finished less then half our plates. Also are they trying to cut costs??? It was hot inside and we were sweating our whole meal long. We will absolutely never try this place again, because we haven't been to a breakfast place this bad in Arizona. Yuk."}
{"text":"Since we use to live close to this restaurant and frequently eat here on weekend mornings we knew it was a sold place to get a good breakfast. Today however was a different story. Both of our breakfasts were cold. I ordered the 1/2 order of brisket Benedict and the egg was cooked solid and was cold. My husband had a traditional 2 eggs, ham steak & potatoes breakfast and his was cold as well and no butter on his toast at all. It was such a let down. We called the waitress over and she apologized and said not to worry and we were free to go. It wasn't even busy yet with the after church crowd. Such a let down.  I should have known something was up since none of the regular servers /staff are there anymore."}
{"text":"Probably a good thing we didn't pour over the reviews before trying Lone Spur. The customer service was prompt and efficient. Our server, Leah, was very helpful and not a bit pushy about getting our order in. Water and coffee was delivered right away. 
I had the Cowboy Benedict ($11.39 full order). It was delicious. Two big biscuits with a 1/2\" thick slice of ham steak covered in sausage gravy. With big chunks of sausage! On top was a \"basted\" egg. It looked poached to me and was perfectly cooked. I opted for the country potatoes as well. I like my breakfast potatoes rather crispy and these came out just how I like them (Pic posted. With a bite already taken ). This dish is big enough to share. I might opt for the 1/2 order next time. Nevertheless, I ate it all. My lovely bride had a build you own omelet which she thoroughly enjoyed. 
All in all, a place I would return to and recommend."}
{"text":"I took a out of town friend there for breakfast it was so bad and cold we didn't eat. They put pieces of cheese over scrambled eggs and told us it was an omelette and the home fries were cold"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant great for breakfast and lunch. Love the colorful table tops and cowboy boots. As a vegetarian, nice to see vegetarian eggs Benedict. Friend tried the corn flake covered French toast and it was different, but tasty."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and service is very friendly! Small cafe that is very cozy. The food is amazing as I love breakfast food and this is definitely a place I'll go back to!"}
{"text":"Had brunch on a busy Saturday morming. Kimberly our server rocked!! As usual the food was delicious and filling. The Biscuits and gravy were excellent and all the food arrived in a very timely manner. Highly recommend the Lone Spur for breakfast if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We look this place up on Yelp seem to be pretty good. However once we got there it was more than just good... Above all Jess Garza gave us great Cowboy service!!! And it was great Cowboy Food. We had the wagon wheel pancake and the bacon steak. Good stuff !!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. About 2 other tables were filled. Service was slow and food was very low quality and overpriced. Sent my hot roast beef sandwich back due to being inedible. Old sliced deli meat sandwiched between a roll with some salty au jus. Gross. Left very disappointed and hungry."}
{"text":"Was in AZ for spring training and looking for a good breakfast spot. This was everything we were looking for and more, starting with the service. Jess Garza knew what to recommend with those frosted flake French toast. We will be back next spring training.

Great cowboy food with great cowgirl service...!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast! Service was quick and staff was friendly! For it being a busy Saturday morning, we got our food pretty quickly and it was tasty! The waitress was very attentive and will for sure be making another trip here for breakfast in the future!"}
{"text":"So had breakfast here last Sunday with the Ex Michael
There was a 10+ minute wait which wasn't bad ! We opted to sit at the bar , unfortunately I don't remember our server name but she was Awesome!  Michael had the chicken fried steak and potatoes he said it was almost as good as Vegas , I had an egg white omelette 
With tomato spinach ham and bacon with sliced avocado on top it was really really good and it came out really quick mimosa was good but a little pricy $$
Coffee was full and robust!! I  this place and close to home also a shout out to the hostess she was nice and polite and professional! I wished I had taken pics of our foods I love food porn! Lol
I will be BACK!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast selections! First time here and I had the French toast special it was great and reasonably priced. Taylor took care of us she was always checking to see if we needed anything and very kind. I will definitely return"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here a week ago and sat at the counter. The service was marginal at best. The scrambled eggs were dry and the thick cut bacon was thin. The potatoes were very good and the sourdough toast was very good also. So we decided to give it a second look. We sat in a booth this time thinking the service would be better. We were wrong. We couldn't get waters or straws for the juice. After 15 minutes we put $10 on the table to pay for the coffee and untouched, unstrawed juice. Still no water. We left....never to return!"}
{"text":"Delicious and hearty breakfast. Excellent service from Michelle and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch with a large group of my Coworkers. I always skip breakfast so, anytime I can eat a breakfast dish, I will. First walking in, it is very very western (Lone Spur) as expected, they played Country music which, made the whole atmosphere feel more welcoming for their theme. We had a friendly server, food came out quickly, and all of our meals tasted great. Half of us had breakfast, and the other half ordered lunch, both were delicious."}
{"text":"Hubby and I have come in a few times for breakfast, and this was no different.  The food is normally pretty good, and the servers are quite friendly.  

Today, I ordered eggs benedict...the eggs were pretty much hard boiled and the food was drowning in hollandaise sauce (way too much).  However, all was made right when Vanessa (the manager) noticed my discontent and came to see what was wrong.  She noticed immediately what the problem was and wanted it solved.  I ended up ordering the french toast instead.  It came out fresh and crispy, they're covered in corn flakes, which somehow don't get soggy, even when covered in syrup!  Vanessa's immediate reaction was really great, and made the situation much easier to handle.

Hubby got the jumbo breakfast burrito...he gobbled it down!  It contained everything he likes, bacon, scrambled eggs, beans, green chili's, salsa, onions and sour cream.  He was practically licking the plate!

We will definitely be back, and I have to say...customer service really does make a difference.  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Today was my turn to pick our destination for Sunday breakfast so we tried something new.  We did not have to wait & were seated right away.  They had tasteful cowboy decor which would be good for entertaining family that visits from the east coast.  Everything comes with the option of upgrading to \"cowboy-sized\".  Judging from the size of the pancakes, that option is not for the faint of heart!!!  I had bacon, scrambled eggs, country potatoes, a biscuit and gravy.  The gravy was tasty with big chunks of sausage.  The potatoes had diced onion and bell peppers which were good but they seemed a tad on the dry side - nothing a little gravy can't fix!  Bacon was thick, coffee was good and so was the service.  Companion 1 had a Belgian waffle which was fluffy and delicious. Companion 2 had the chorizo scramble which he said was good except he wishes he would've skipped the sour cream which made the dish really rich.  We had a great experience and will be back.  (Note to self, there was obviously a wait by the time we left so plan accordingly.)"}
{"text":"Decent place. I had the thick cut bacon and eggs; bacon was flavorful and the eggs were decent. Breakfast potatoes were bland even with the mixed peppers. Nice decor and I'm glad there is a close option for breakfast now in Glendale. Good prices and average service."}
{"text":"We decided to eat here for breakfast per recommendation from some friends. Unfortunately we were not impressed. The service was good enough, however the food was a different story. My wife got the eggs Benedict and the ham was VERY tough and the sauce on it tasted like they opened a can of cream of chicken soup and dumped it on. It was inedible. I got the cowboy hash with the biscuits and gravy side. The cowboy hash was ok but again the gravy tasted canned and was inedible. Maybe their traditional pancakes and eggs are good, idk, but we will not return."}
{"text":"I would give five stars because the food was good and the service was good. Reason for one star? My sister ordered pancakes and wanted fruit instead of syrup. Requested bananas and strawberries. What a joke! For $.99 she received 4 1/4\" slices of banana and for $.99 a small sliced strawberry."}
{"text":"Great brunch. The jam is a must have. There is a great family feel. I sat at the counter and was treated with friendly service. I'm definitely a repeat customer. With that being said, I have to clarify that I dine during the week when there is no wait. This is not someplace to go if you want quick service during busy weekend times."}
{"text":"First time customers and certainly NOT the last time going back. It's located in a strip mall area and parking might be a bit packed. Serving portions are pretty big and hearty so be prepared. I ordered the Tuna Melt with a side salad and it was amazing. Also ordered the biscuits and gravy to share and it is TO DIE FOR - best that I've had. Overall, the atmosphere, the staff, the food, the service are all 5 stars"}
{"text":"First time at Lone Spur Cafe for breakfast and was not disappointed!  Our waitress was Ally and she was fantastic!  Very helpful with selections, finding out info for us from the chef, attentive and friendly!  Our breakfast was fresh and tasty!  Will be back!"}
{"text":"I live so close to this place and didn't even know it was there! I went this morning after my parents suggested it. I loved it! I got a Denver omelet with potatoes and a biscuit and gravy (SO GOOD). The omelet had a lot of oil on it, but it was still pretty good overall. Our waitress was really nice too. Next time I'll venture out and try their French toast."}
{"text":"Amazing service and excellent breakfast. Definitely try this place!
Mara our server was definitely accommodating and very attentive. We even met the cook he came to the table to see how everything was and the owner/manager also came by our table and cleared our plates.  The staff goes the extra mile to ensure your experience is top notch. I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Ordered Huevous Ranchos and Biscuits and Gravy to share. Staff very friendly and helpful. Food came out quick and hot. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We've been going to Lone Spur since it opened. The service is always 5 star (IMO, Amy is the best) but, sometimes, the kitchen needs help. You can't run a good restaurant without competent kitchen staff. The Lone Spur needs a great chief and some good Indians. Breakfast was very good this week and we're going to keep coming."}
{"text":"Great place to go for Breakfast except for the last couple times I've gone in the place its so cold you have to keep your jacket or sweater on. I looked around and everyone else had them on also. When I told them about it they just said will tell the manager. I mention that I had been in a week ago and it was cold also. What's the problem.
You really can't enjoy your meal if your thinking lets hurry up and get out of here its cold.
Also, they were short on servers. No relief was coming per the manager. Those poor ladies were really trying there best to accommodate everyone.
Note to owner: Hey, please fix the heat problem. I told my friends if you decide to go make sure you take a sweater or jacket.  

Will stop going for awhile."}
{"text":"It was exciting to see a Lone Spur in town because we LOVE the original Prescott location. We've been twice so far, once for breakfast and once for lunch. Both times the food was great and the service followed suit."}
{"text":"Decided to go back and try breakfast, not impressed at all. Ordered eggs scrambled with cheese, sausage patty (2) and diced potatoes (they stop serving hash browns at 11?) with biscuit/gravy. The eggs were ok nothing special, potatoes, meh not much flavor, sausage patty were pretty cold so toss them, now the biscuit/gravy, the gravy is so darn THINK its gross, large pieces of sausage in the gravy-gravy to think to even cover a biscuit. Way over priced!!! I think Im done, which is to bad was really hoping to have somewhere close as a go to place for breakfast."}
{"text":"This review is about the wait of food NOT based on the food. 


Came here on Mothers day weekend. Very excited to try this place as I had heard many good things. The wait to get in was very quick. It was packed but not too packed. It was still early enough where it wasn't that jammed. 

ANYWAYS. We ordered our food and no flipping joke we waited 55 minutes until we decided to leave our table without getting our food. I KNOW it was 55 minutes exactly because of a phone call I made. We were checked on twice before we left. We tried to find someone to tell them we were leaving and STILL couldn't find anyone. 

I was really bummed and really annoyed. I'll probably give this place a second chance to actually try the food. I understand it was Mothers Day. I really do but that's unacceptable to wait an hour for two people who ordered an omelet and french toast. Grrr"}
{"text":"Went to the location in Peoria with my wife. We both thought the place was nice but crowded and thought the samething that the portions where huge! our server Jess G. was very polite and friendly. It wasn't until we where done with our meals that we realized that we had been to a Lone Spur already....lol it was the Prescott location. Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast two days in row while working on my plane. Food & service great! Chicken fried steak & eggs, yummy. Brisket Benedict likewise.

Great American standard food!"}
{"text":"Started off with a wilted salad. Next our Prime Rib was tasteless, not cooked to our order and Food was all cold! Very Expensive and Horrible Dinner!"}
{"text":"My husband had patronized the Lone Spur in Prescott when he lived up there and he loved the place.  We hadn't tried this one yet because of the mediocre reviews but I decided to take him there for Father's Day.  That was a mistake.  We waited a long time for a table even when there were clean tables ready to go.  I don't know why they weren't seating people at them.  The waitress was nice but told us the kitchen was backed up -- so basically we were going to wait a while for our food -- which we did.  When the food came, it was delivered by someone other than our waitress.  The bacon we ordered crisp was nowhere near crisp.  They didn't bring my husband's milk, extra butter, or jelly.  All of our scrambled eggs were over-cooked.  His food was barely warm.  He had to leave the table and go to the counter to ask for his milk, butter and jelly.  They gave him his milk but were supposed to bring the other items.  They didn't so he had to go back to the counter to ask for them.  By the time he got them, his food was cold.  We called over the manager and told her we wanted the food remade.  She took it back and returned a short while later with new food but he had ordered his potatoes plain (which was clearly obvious in looking at them on the plate) but the new order came with peppers and onions in the potatoes.  He refused the food and she apologized and took it off the bill but still charged us for the rest of the food but gave us coupons to come back.  It was Father's Day and he didn't even get to have breakfast.  We went to Jack in the Box afterwards.  To be honest, they shouldn't have charged us anything for the inconvenience.  Even with the coupons, I doubt very much we will be going back.  The only positive I can give is that pancakes were delicious."}
{"text":"Came here one morning for breakfast before the football game. Ordered a breakfast burrito, biscuits and gravy and the chicken fried steak. All were fresh, made to order and very satisfying. The bloody Mary was very good, and you can get beer for breakfast as well... Major plus! We were visiting from out of town, and if we come back we will be going again. The service was great, great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Went out of my way to try this place... bummer. 12 customers in the place  
initial greeter maybe management because she was discussing labor costs with other gal, was nice. Asked if first time and said yes, best sandwich is Ruben she replied when asked. So away she went. I think my server was Jess (said on receipt).. finally showed up and I placed my order, Ruben with salad also cup of Chili up first please. 10 minutes I asked a passer by about the chili and she said it doesn't come up first unless you ask.. she was not my waiters so she didn't know. Chili finally showed taste pretty good.... Little later she brings my salad and said the sandwich isn't done yet but thought you may want to munch...finished that and then a little later the Ruben... a greasy mess.. when they toasted the bread the bottom slice was toasted in so the bottom was just a soggy mess. All said the food was not that bad but what really ticked me off is NO ONE ever asked? How is it, how was it nothing or I'd of made a suggestion.. With their high rent I don't see them making the New Year"}
{"text":"Sadly, today I have to take back 3 stars from my other visits. I ordered a blt sandwich with french onion soup. The blt was broken over cooked bacon bits, the thinest sliced tomato and a leaf of lettuce. How can one screw up a blt is beyond me. Now to the soup that arrived 10 minutes after my sandwich and uneatable. It was like someone took beef base added some onions then filled the cup with salad croutons. I am guessing they microwaved it allowing the croutons to disintegrate like mush. My server was pleasant but the kitchen staff were yelling and seemed a lot of horse play going on, must not have had a manager on duty. Now to top this visit off the large cook, I think I heard his name Steven yelled a few times, with dirty uniform walks to a few tables to shake hands and talk with guests only to go back to touching food in the kitchen without washing his hands. While I have been here 4 other times without problem and even giving them a Yelp of 5 stars, This visit made me take back 3 stars and it will be hard to come back anytime soon.

previous post!
What a gem for breakfast! Tried the corned beef hash and eggs which came with cubed potatoes with bell pepper. Also a biscuit and sausage gravy. All in all the service was good and the food above average. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check this place out before going to see a movie. The decor is very western as in cowboy but we like that sort of thing growing up riding horses and all. The weight staff was very friendly and the food was excellent.  I had the cowboy Benedict 1/2 order (it was still large) and my husband got the chicken fried steak and eggs. It was so yummy. I must say I am a little bit of a country gravey snob and theirs is very, very good!!  I highly recommend this place, for breakfast anyways, will let you know how lunch and dinner is sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Awful!!!  Biscuits and gravy should contain cooked sausage!  Save your money and avoid this place.  Overpriced. Service was poor. Had to return eggs since they were not as I ordered. Never asked again if things were ok.  Awkward silence. Took our card to pay bill and end of conversation. She was done with us!"}
{"text":"Yuck!  Omelet overdone, hash browns cold and oatmeal runny!  Don't recommend this place. Service is slow too. 
Save your money. Go to ihop"}
{"text":"Good food, adequate service... too \"western\" for my tastes, but the food keep bringing me back.

Breakfast specials are great values, and though pricey, it's the best steak I have eaten anywhere in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Wow! My sister and I went for brunch and I got a salad and it was heavenly!! Mixed greens with bacon, chicken, boiled egg, avocado, feta YES PLEASE!! I will be coming back every time I come to AZ and visit my family- it's THAT good! Service was very friendly too! As im writing this review I'm craving it again!"}
{"text":"Here I am Sunday morning at 10:30.  Expected a wait but was immediate seated. Michelle our server was friendly, prompt and attended to every request.  The food portions are very large.  At 300lbs, I'm no stranger to the knife and fork, but I took half my order home.  Had chicken fried steak, eggs and biscuit w/gravy.  Wife had eggs Benedict.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place has, by far, the best breakfast burrito I have ever had! The portion sizes were huge, the coffee was good, and for the amount of food we got the prices were almost too low! Our waitress was very nice and attentive! And they had free WiFi that worked great!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a whim. I have wanted to try this place while now. I was greeted as I came in the door. I was seated fast. The server was so sweet and attentive. The food came fast and was delicious. I am glad I stopped in today. I work across the street and it's nice to know there is a good place to eat."}
{"text":"We gave the restaurant a second try and glad we did--it improved a lot from it's first hiccups. Turned out to be one of our favorite go to places close to home for breakfast-esp. the omelets. So sorry they closed,we will miss it."}
{"text":"We have eaten both breakfast and dinner here and have not been disappointed. The service was friendly and fast. The waitresses made some helpful suggestions. The food was delicious and cooked perfectly. The hot cakes are huge and one was more than enough. The ribs are tender and fall right off the bone. We would recommend this place to others and will be returning to try more dishes. You get big portions for your money."}
{"text":"Will never return. My husband got an extra order of dead fly added to his breakfast plate and I received a bonus crusty old chicken nugget with mine. Didn't get to see the manager, I heard her name was Kelly though! A nice young lady over the counter (sorry, didn't get your name) did take care of our entire check and offered to remake our orders to go if we'd like but....nahhh. One dead fly is enough.
Truly disappointed."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant opened recently and gave it a try. We had a really good breakfast here. I had the Wagon Wheel Pancake (huge) with scrambled eggs (well done) and bacon. I also tried some of the potatoes my boyfriend got. Everything was yummy. And the food came out quick! I was surprised. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Service! Well maintained clean, organized with a nice ambiance. 
My breakfast came out fast and was cooked to order & tasted great! I will be back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Western Themed Cafe! I love it, great breakfast. I ordered the Wagon Wheel pancakes when I went with my sister and I loved them do much. Not disappointed, I would recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast last week with my mom and ordered a build-your-own omelette and a side of bacon. Honestly it was probably the best omelette I've ever had at a restaurant. The bacon was really good too. My mom ordered a pancake that is the size of a spare tire. I tried a bite of it and it was pretty amazing as well. I don't know how they are for lunch but they're awesome for breakfast."}
{"text":"I simply was not impressed with the food. I did however like the venue and the decor. Too bad the food didn't deliver. We had breakfast and my meat was BURNT on one side and barely touched the grill on the other. Of course my meat was served burnt side down so as to hide the fact that it was BURNT. 

The experience with our waitress was odd. She didn't engage much. Usually there is some kind of interaction outside of just a robot order taker with a \"what kind of bread do you want\" instead of at least offering up what kind they offer. The interaction was very minimal despite the fact that she did show up at the table an adequate number of times. My hubby and I both agreed it was a bit awkward. I would have liked to complain about my meat but chose not to bother her. Had I had a more friendly and engaged server, I would have definitely returned my meat. 

We didn't care for the non-traditional \"home fries\" as breakfast home fries. They were very tasty, but they were deep fried wedges of potatoes with a few strands of pepper and onion added after the fact. I think they would better serve as a side to a steak in lieu of french fries. I prefer my breakfast home fries actually cooked with the pepper and onion and I prefer more pepper and onion. 

The one star is DEFINITELY because my breakfast meat was literally BURNT and the cook thought it was okay to serve it to me. It was very tough and dry and I did not eat it. Again, too bad. We liked the place itself and would probably would have gone back. It just didn't leave us with a desire to do so."}
{"text":"This place is great! Delicious food and friendly atmosphere. I had the corned beef hash & eggs with biscuits & gravy. Hubby had Chicken fried steak. Both were amazing! Good coffee too. Family friendly. Just moved to the area, and this will be our local spot for sure!"}
{"text":"Visiting family in Phoenix, we came here for breakfast on day one. Day three, we came back again because I was in love with the food! The decor is awesome and themes in southwestern cowboy. For meat lovers, there is nothing better than the Bacon Steak....So worth it. 

I can go on about how interesting this place is as an eatery. Breakfast become so monotonous and their take on French toast, grits, and meat is amazing. If your an eggs Benedict fan, they have several refreshing options for it. I'm gonna stop writing about it because I'm about to eat it. But one last note...try their apricot jelly. It's not on the menu."}
{"text":"Disappointing, although the gravy and hollandaise were delicious. Food was bland, even the biscuits and country potatoes - haven't they heard of salt?  Hubby had Joe's scramble, it says that it is seasoned ground beef but there was no flavor,  not even salt and pepper helped.  I had the veggie Benedict the veggie being spinach which they are very stingy with, avocado was good, English muffin was toasted well.  Have eaten at Prescott location food is definitely not the same"}
{"text":"I just enjoyed the best Denver Omelet ever. We had excellent food and fantastic service from Jamie. Thank you for an awesome start to my day. Love the cowboy ambiance."}
{"text":"I give this restaurant 4 stars i would have given it 5 but a few of the orders in my party were incorrect. BUT...... it was 10 in our party, we were seated in the back in a room to accommodate all of us comfortably and we were seated fast which we all appreciated. Our servers name was Elizabeth and she was GREAT!!! She was so friendly and very helpful! She made our brunch very nice! Food was EXCELLENT! The prices were perfect! Will definitely be back and will recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A friend went and told me that he enjoyed it. He's been a few times. Finally went in for breakfast with the better half. Atmosphere was great liked the decor, service was good, but we came here to eat. I got corned beef hash with eggs and a side of bacon. She got a omelette. We both got the biscuits and gravy. Only good thing I could say was the bacon was good. Hash was just full of potatoes. Biscuits and gravy were bland. My eggs were undercooked and runny. When I took a bite I had to spit it out I was afraid I was gonna throw up all over my plate. Home fries where just deep fried crispy crap. The better half usually doesn't complain about anything and she found the food to be not good at all and left probably 3/4 of her meal I left about 1/2 of mine. Waitress asked how it was I said just look at our plates we're leaving hungry!"}
{"text":"Cool place great location, chef walked around and talked to us before we even got our food. Glad to see more small business succeed and grow in AZ. Oh the food is great too. Real deal biscuits and gravy"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite place to eat now!! Can't wait to go back! HIGHLY Recommend! Take your friends and family! Go out for a breakfast date!"}
{"text":"Excellent food today!! We had the chorizo scramble, chicken fried steak and the cowboy Benedict- everything was excellent and huge portions for the price. Coffee was good and the refills kept coming! Service was great despite them being short handed!!"}
{"text":"Great food but questionable service. Been here before but my last visit is indeed my last. We were promptly seated in a light crowd because it was early and 4th of July week. After our orders were placed and approx 20-25 minutes, we realized several tables seated after us were eating.  No one was checked back on us or were giving us order statuses. I politely stood by the kitchen to get someone's attention to ask about our meal. It was explained to my husband that our order got lost. I asked the poor associate who was tasked with the unfortunate job of giving a patron the bad news, vs. the manager taking the bite for the team and trying to smooth things over, if our bill was going to reflect some adjustment?  He explained no but we'd be given discounts for our next visit. I explained that's assuming I want to come back after this experience. I asked the associate to convey this to management, better yet, asked for management to come talk to me. The manager never came. The server who forgot about us for the good portion of a half-hour now shows with discount cards without even a genuine apology. I am now not appreciating this place's inability to handle their error and now especially do not want to give them my business. I was not about to force their hand to do the right thing. We walked out. I brought multiple parties here for breakfast in the past. Other establishments appreciate patronage and provide better basic human respect."}
{"text":"We stopped in here for lunch and ended up getting late breakfast because it just looked so good. It is more food than I have ever been served in a restaurant. It is now our go to breakfast place for a family with several very large college aged men!  I am always looking for a cheap place to feed the \"boys.\" Great food, friendly service. Checked all the boxes"}
{"text":"Wondering how all those old Cowboys stayed so lean if this is the kind of grub they ate. Awesome!  We opted for an early afternoon breakfast the menu looked so good and were rewarded with outstanding meals. Even the small burrito was so large, half of it went home for tomorrow. Great service and fun Western decor ensures we'll be back soon for lunch. Or another tasty breakfast. Best find in awhile!"}
{"text":"Saw this place on my way into park west for some Christmas shopping and noticed it was new so I took the dive! My family and I were greeted by Michelle who was sweet and attentive. I got the veggie Benedict which was huge, my grandmother got a huge looking yummy salad. The building is tastefully decorated in south western decor but it's not over the top or tacky. The food exceeded my expectations. Loved the rub on the fries and potatoes, and the fries were crispy and light. 
Next time I'll be trying the pancakes as Michelle recommended! Will be back again with the fam, excited to try some new stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"This is our weekend breakfast spot. We have ordered many different menu items and they have all been good. Fast friendly service too."}
{"text":"We've been here twice for breakfast and twice we were fully satisfied. From the food to the service to the cleanliness everything was great. 

I've had the breakfast sandwich and the wagon wheel pancake. For once a restaurant that knows how to cook over medium eggs! The bacon is thick with a bit of saltiness that I love! My wife has ordered the chorizo scramble both times and both times she has loved it. The biscuits and gravy are absolutely delicious. The portions are not a complete overload of food. 

We've seen restaurants and bars come and go from this spot and we're hoping Lone Spur is an occupant for many many more visits from us!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place in Prescott. We were excited to hear they were opening close to us. Been here twice and we'll keeping coming back. French toast special is great. Happy they have the same menu as Prescott. Really hoping this place makes it too. We need more places in the west valley."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but this place doesn't deserve its rating. When you are doing only breakfast and lunch, you had better have those Nailed. 
They do not. I had chicken fried steak and eggs with house cut potatoes and biscuits with gravy. Eggs were over done not over medium.
The Steak was bland as was the gravy.
The potatoes were under cooked in the middle, but brown and crispy outside? ( pieces were cut too large). Service was good but couldn't make up for poor food quality.
Parking also was poor, had to park behind another restaurant and walk through a \"hall\" then back to front door. I Won't be back for more."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast for lunch today at Lone Spur. Had biscuits and gravy and this was the first time ever where a place put enough gravy on the biscuits.  The sausage in the gravy was fantastic too!  The rest of the family devoured their meals and everyone agreed 5 stars with the fries being a highlight."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast.  Split the cowboy sized Denver omelet with husband.  Service was good, the food was hot, fresh and made with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Came here for Fathers Day and was a terrible experience.  My wife posted a review on that. Figured we would try them ONE more time.  The girl was messing with menus or something when we came in, acknowledged us after a few seconds but took her sweet time coming over to seat us and they were not busy.  We had tried to call before coming to see if they were even open on July 4 and they didn't answer the phone and after a couple of times we just gave up.  Place is empty.  I ordered a glass of water and specifically said no lemon and the server brought it with lemon in it. We ordered a basic breakfast, the wagon wheel pancake with eggs and bacon. Bacon was barely cooked after asking for it crisp. We sent it back and they brought it out burnt and deep-fried . My wife's eggs were scrambled instead of over medium. Can't get hashbrowns after 11 AM.  They offered to remake the eggs and we said no but then they tried to bring them anyway. My wife told the server she should never have brought the wrong ones out.  I mean that's her only job. I had to ask for the glass of milk I had ordered after my meal was delivered and they only have one size which is a small tiny juice glass. The next round of bacon came out deep-fried but at least not burnt. I don't understand why you can't cook bacon where it's not limp without it being burned. I'm able to do it at home.  Sadly, we won't be back.  The manager was told, she looked over at us but never came over but then discounted our meal. She should be ashamed."}
{"text":"We went here not knowing what to expect and were surprised about the portion size of the food. It was very good and we love our waitress Brandi (who came from Biscuits Cafe - your loss cafe). We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I came here Saturday morning and the very next day on Sunday and it was delicious. I had the same thing both times (corned beef hash) because it was so good. Sunday I brought my son and got him a pancake and some berries on the side. The pancake was very light and airy, kind of like the ones at Cracker Barrel and those are my favorite!!! I've never been here for lunch or dinner but have heard to only go for breakfast as the lunch/dinner isn't that great. Our server on both days was April and she seemed like she didn't want to be there. Very monotone in her speech and checked on us only a few times to ask if it looked okay. I'm curious to see the other servers! 

The restaurant is quite loud so keep that in mind too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Lone Spur Cafe today for a late breakfast/brunch... Place completely rocks!! 

We were greeted appropriately and seated promptly. Our server approached us almost immediately and had an iPad to take our order!! None of this memory stuff that so many places try and do... Using technology like this makes the ordering more efficient and accurate!! Completely impressed with this!! 

My wife ordered their French Toast!! She loved it (so did I... I tried it).... It was made from Raisin Bread and crusted in Corn Flakes.. Delish!! She also had a side of Corned Beef Hash which was awesome too!!

I had the Ribeye with eggs over easy... Comes with toast OR biscuit with gravy... Of course I went with Blthe biscuit with gravy (almost as good as moms... Almost).... My Steak was delicious and cooked just as ordered it!! 

Our servers name was Katie and she was completely awesome!! 

Additionally impressive was seeing an actual \"working manager\".... Coming from the restaurant business, it frustrates me when I do not see a manager working on the floor... At this joint we saw Mark hustling around and delivering food, seating people, and talking with the staff when he had a minute to catch his breath... Completely impressive!! 

We highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back and try the Prime Rib on the weekend!!! Yum!!
