{"text":"Delish! Get the crab puffs! The orange and sweet and sour chicken are great, my boyfriend loves the beef and broccoli.

Carry out is ready when promised."}
{"text":"First visit here. Service was good and my food was out pretty quickly. Like 5 minutes quick. Probably not the best choice for a post workout meal though. Food was good for the price. Got the lunch special, total came to $5.70. Would prolly come again."}
{"text":"Sweet and Sour pork and Beef with Broccoli is outstanding.  The Garlic chicken is good too.  Had to up the stars because two was really unfair after one dish.  Service is super fast and you won't find a much better price!  I'll keep ordering for a long, long time!"}
{"text":"My family has been getting delivery from here for years, and I LOVE their egg rolls. I've been inside once as well and it was quiet and quaint."}
{"text":"Me and my wife ordered Wor Wonton Soup. It was delicious! Our new favorite. Cream puffs also were excellent. Some reviews stating that the food is bland but we thought it is better than being salty. Little bit of soy sauce can get the taste to your liking. Place is nice and quiet. Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Food is good and well priced for its portions.  Do not use the online ordering website/BringMeThat.  Had much confusion with staff as to whether they owned a website, or used a third party website.  Staff actually recommended not using one.  Call-ins preferred.

Portions are a good size, and overall well made.  Used delivery service and was ok with temperature and time.  

Been here 3 times and not too busy.  Enjoy the quiet dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Chinese place to eat! I always get egg drop soup with a dollar worth of beef! They are super friendly and food is always right on!!!! I've been coming here for 10 years now. and many more years to come!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We moved out of their normal delivery area but my kids and I still drive the 20 minutes to get food here. The staff has been there a long time and they are very friendly and helpful. I travel all over the country and this is by far the best Chinese restaurant I have been to."}
{"text":"Cheap lunch but the food was pretty bad. Luke warm soup, Mongolian Beef might as well be called Mongolian Grizzle, inedible. The Sweet & Sour Chicken was WAY over done, with the sauce at least it was edible, though very chewy and I was unable to cut with a fork. The rice was as dry as the desert. The spring roll wasn't bad. I will not be back."}
{"text":"Great take-out Chinese, love the crab puffs!

Everything we have ordered off the menu has been great.  We've eaten in once and the place was dead, but the waitstaff was attentive.  Food is served hot and tastes great.

I'm never disappointed in the quality of the takeout and visit regularly."}
{"text":"Pong Pong is the best Chinese place. I have been going there for over 8 years. The whole family is hooked, most of my friends are too. The food is always fresh and the staff is nice which you can't find good customer service today."}
{"text":"I had the orange chicken 3 hours later i was vomiting with severe stomach cramps dont eat there its garbage cashier didnt give a reciept with my. Change from a 50 the sauce tasted like ketchup and water horrible place ive never vomited so hard in my life now im just waiting for the diareah........."}
{"text":"This is hands down one of my favorite places to eat. The servers are friendly, the food is AWESOME! The prices are reasonable with large serving sizes. I've NEVER had a problem with Pong Pongs and have recommended this place to several family and friends. They also share the same opinion. If you get a chance, stop by and try it for yourself. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food is good.  I did not love the sesame chicken that many of the reviews here recommended.  Basic, standard Chinese food - I would eat here again, but there are quite a few places closer to me that are about the same.  I requested and received a menu - but I was told that they have new menus coming.  I asked, and yes the new menu will have new pricing.  NOTE: the fried won tons are just deep fried wrappers - there is no meat or filling."}
{"text":"Pricing was good however the food wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I went in and it was empty. Now I know why. I will never go here again unfortunately."}
{"text":"My children and I have been dining here for years...even as our Christmas Eve dinner location in years past...We've never had a negative experience at Pong Ping or with their delivery."}
{"text":"In searching for a Chinese food place in North Phoenix I found Pong Pong on Bell Rd. I was initially sketched out by the exterior of the building as it's a little run down and got even more sketched out when I came in a there was no one in the restaurant. I braved it and ordered the typical Chinese food staple, chicken fried rice and sweet and sour chicken. For the two large orders I paid $16. Got home food was still hot. The rice had a little too much soy  sauce on it as it was a bit too salty, but it wouldn't keep me from ordering it again. The thing that impressed me the most was the chicken used in the sweet and sour chicken. All too many Chinese food places use the frozen chicken pieces for all the chicken dishes, Pong Pong prepares their chicken pieces in house. I respect that! The sweet and sour chicken was good and flavorful. I have since returned and got the same thing and it was consistent. Two large sides fed my wife and I for two days. I plan on returning and trying some different dishes."}
{"text":"We have been ordering delivery from Pong Pong for years. Everyone is so friendly and food is good. Price is very reasonable. Orange and lemon chicken is a little soggy but I figure that is just because it soaks up the sauce in the time it takes to arrive to our home."}
{"text":"Upon entering I was worried and a bit skeptical. The place could use some TLC but I wouldn't consider it dirty, just aged.  We ordered one sesame chicken , one kp chicken and a cpl sides. The food is great! The people are friendly and I noticed employees eat the food for their lunches ( which is a GREAT sign for me).

I have no complaints for this little place, it definitely deserves more business!"}
{"text":"I really like pong pong when I am craving some Chinese food. The sweet and sour chicken is very good, chicken lo mein, and the cream cheese puffs.  The actual restaurant is a little scary, kind of old and always empty - I usually get it delivered.  Good portion sizes."}
{"text":"For phoenix the food is pretty good. It was really hard to find good Chinese food out here for some reason. I'll keep coming here until I find something better. I really miss the back east Chinese food."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Chinese restaurant for the past 7 years. I always get the house special chicken and chicken chow mein and it is amazing every time. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for amazing Chinese food in the glendale area."}
{"text":"Pong pong sucks ding dongs  panda express   is better .and I'm not a fan of panda express  they can both go to he'll. I have only eaten there twice   the first tell tell sign should have  been when I seen 2 elder people  sitting in chef coats  looking 70 plus. There was only one couple in there and it looked like they were being held hostage. Like  a 2 year old being fed vegetables and they were stuck in the corner. No one puts baby in the corner.I should have known by the dumb  ass name . Pong pong really."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food....I order from them so often the delivery guy could find my house in sleep!  Try the moo shu pork!!"}
{"text":"I ordered for a few co-workers and I. First time and sadly enough last time.
Very bland, I can't even finish my dish. Also the bag I had my boxes in had all the sauces mixed together and openend and the boxes weren't clsoed fully.
I ordered for 4 people and none of them liked their food. Would think it could be just me, bit obviously not. Eeeww."}
{"text":"Great food good delivery service ..thanks..I like there lunch special ..and fried rice"}
{"text":"Great place! 10/10 would take out again! The fried rice fits my usual taste and the chow mein was top notch! Probably needed more chicken in the chow mein but that doesn't stop me from giving all five stars. Found my \"usual Chinese food place\" from now on!"}
{"text":"First time ordering from here. Ordered for delivery. I got an email confirming my order, also stating it would arrive in 45 mins. It got to me way faster! It's hot, cooked perfectly, and delicious! I ordered the sweet and sour pork (it comes with white rice), the crab puffs, fried shrimp and the egg drop soup. It is all amazing, good portions for the price! Will definitely be ordering from here again!!!"}
{"text":"This is are family favorite place to eat. We come hear for birthdays and to have family dinners. I never liked chinese food till i ate hear.  There lunch special is awesome! Pong pong chicken plate is the best! I get it as white meat for an extra $1 . Dont let the older look inside fool you beacuse this is the food in town. We acsually going tonight for my daughter's birthday."}
{"text":"These mother facking dipshits at pong pong.  The sad thing is I actually enjoyed eating at pong pong.  Tonight I didnt want to go out, I ordered delivery and that was my fack up.  I ordered 30 dollars worth of food and was waiting in anticipation until the 45 minutes I was told for delivery slowly passed.  50 minutes.  55 minutes.  60 minutes.  I call into pong pong and ask if my food has left yet.  I told them its been over an hour and if it hasnt left my wife will pick it up.  The girl on the phone actually has the nerve to give me attitude.  She tells well too bad the delivery driver has left.  At this point I'm thinking good because I am hungry.  75 minutes in I call back and just cancel my order.  Meanwhile they have already charged my credit card.

This is the kind of bullshit that just doesnt need to happen.  Do you think anyone gives a fack about customer service anymore?  Fack no, we should be so lucky to eat their food.  The girls on the phone then mocks me and says, \"sorry we only have one delivery driver.\"  I was like TF, then dont tell me 45 minutes.  I live 2 minutes away!!!!!!!!!!!  If I could go back I would just have picked it up and spared myself some more subpar experiences.  

You know there is a little Vietnamese joint down the road called Nam Sao.  You wont find better customer service, they'll treat you like family and they are proud of their food.  The sad thing is in this economy they are struggling.  Thats sad to see when places like pong pong are willing to throw customer's (that actually like their food) away like trash.  I guess in this economy pong pong can afford to lose customers.

I hope the management at pong pong sees this and I hope it sinks in that they just lost a family of four as customers that fully enjoyed their food in the past.

Shame on you pong pong.  I wonder how many people would kill for a position taking orders for a chinese joint these days.  Yet pong pong employs people that clearly have no idea what it means to service a customer.

yes I am pissed.

same on you pong pong.


ps the delivery driver actually shows up like 90 minutes in and hasnt been informed of my cancellation."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Pong Pongs since the first week they opened and yup thats a long time ago. I love this place!!! I love the house fried rice, eggs rolls, sesame chicken, crab puffs and on and on. I have tried most of the menu over the years and have never had anything bad. Do not expect high end ingredients but the flavor is great and so is the price. The people here are very nice and they always remember me which makes it even better. If you have not tried Pong Pongs then you need to. You will happy you did. In fact im going there right now for some take out. Best way to get it is to get it to go."}
{"text":"We have had delivery from Pong Pong's for over 20 years and have consistently had good food, but last night I must say, it was outstanding! The best we have ever had from them or any other Chinese restaurant. We had hot and sour soup, fried rice, amazing chicken and house lo mein and all of it was cooked and flavored perfectly! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit here.  Tucked quaintly in the middle of a strip mall, the entrance does not do justice to the nice interior of the restaurant.   Seated promptly upon entry.  Ordered Won Ton soup as an appetizer and enjoyed the mushroom laden soup with a unique flavor.  

For the entree we had the chef special sizzling seafood  platter served with brown rice.  It tasted fresh and delicious.  Overall a very enjoyable experience and I'm looking forward to many return visits."}
{"text":"The people here are really nice, maybe because I order here once a week. Lunch specials here are really good. Most are under 5 bucks and you get fried rice, an egg roll, and friend wontons with your selection. I stick to the vegetarian and beef dishes. The chicken can sometimes be a little off. The Mushus are soooooo good and they wrap them for you before you pick them up. I always get take out, never eat in the restaurant. Something about chinese food, you got to sit on the couch in front of the tv with your man and eat out of the containers in your pjs...hello kitty slippers and all :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite hole in the wall Place to eat. Arizona's best kept secret when it comes to the Sesame Chicken. I've been coming here for 20 years. A rating! Tell them Derek sent you!"}
{"text":"I drove by this place so many times and never noticed it. 
Ordered lunch.
Lots of food. Really, LOTS of food for the price.

Sesame Chicken was just OK. 
Sa-Te Chicken was forgettable...
Egg roll was typical.
Crab Puff was typical. 
They were very friendly and the food was hot.
I'll pass on this place in the future."}
{"text":"We have been coming back to Pong Pong for years; so that is saying something.  I do find that their fried chicken dishes seem to be over fried, but everything else is great.  You do get a hugenamount of food for what you pay.  Do wish they opened a smidge earlier on weekends, but it is what it is."}
{"text":"Sesame chicken was pretty good. My husband loved the egg roles and crab puffs. Over all pretty good food!:)"}
{"text":"If there is such a thing as comfort chinese food this is the place.

Look, its been around forever so thats saying something.

The food is really good, if not great, and its reasonably priced.

Location is central to about everything.

Bit of a dive, not gonna lie.

You wont hate it, I promise you that."}
{"text":"By far the worst customer service ever. I ordered $60 worth of food to be delivered to my house. After an hour wait the food finally got here FREEZING COLD. When I called to let them know they told me there is no way there food is cold and had no care in the world. I will never order from this place again and I advise everyone else to stay away."}
{"text":"I like this place, its cheap as hell and delicious for what you pay for.  Now many may disagree like my girlfriend or others who have not great reviews but the chicken dishes are good, especially the amazing chicken which is nothing short of it, amazing that is.  They have an un filled fish tank and an Asian man whom was pot bellied gave me my togo order both of which are unsettling but the food was good and the price was right for example wonton soup for a dollar full meals under  7 plus a cool name like table tennis, think about it forrest"}
{"text":"I live behind the place and have to say that they have good food.  I go there maybe 5 to 6 times a year and never have any complaints.  I recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Just not good.

This was my first time dining at Pong Pong.  My lunch companion selected the Amazing Chicken and I had the Pong Pong Chicken lunch special. The lunch specials come with a cup of Egg Drop soup, a fried wonton, and eggroll.

The egg drop soup was excellent.  The Pong Pong Chicken  was very bland, and drowned peking sauce. I chose brown rice in lieu of fried rice and the rice was just okay. I thought the fried wonton was very greasy and the Egg Roll, I didn't  care for the filling

Overall just not good food. I'd like to end on a positive note. The service was outstanding. The staff is friendly and inviting and will explain everything on their menu.  The prices and serving portions can't be beat.  I just wish the food was a better quality."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Chinese food. Right in our area and always friendly service. The sesame chicken is awesome! Also you've got to try the pot stickers! They take awhile because they make them fresh but they are the bomb.com!!"}
{"text":"Bad fried rice. Cheap prices. Descent crab puffs, eggrolls, sesame chicken, and monk vegetables (could do without the almonds)"}
{"text":"Average Chinese food. Seemed like small portions but it was actually more than enough."}
{"text":"This place used to be good back in 1998 but their cleanliness is not there. Go behind the place and just roll down the window. They shouldn't even serve this food to hogs let all me paying customers. Check out new Asian kitchen they have much better food."}
{"text":"Pong Pongs has been here forever. The food is cheap chinese food but usually has really good flavor. They have all the standard dishes.  

The only bad thing is they use \"parts r parts\" chicken. I usually end up having a discard pile. (thx Ryan C) but can deal with it. 

Just do not go expecting great high end dining. 

They DO deliver!"}
{"text":"Never busy... Not sure how you choose interpret that. My son loves this place, gets the sesame chicken or orange chicken ... He thinks it's the best. I on the other hand not in love with this place. Honestly though haven't found a Chinese restraint that I do love. My decision is made on the hot and sour soup which the first time wasn't fantastic, the second time was better however still not the best. Which for me was in California. I don't care for their ping pong chicken which is plain fried chicken pieces with sauce poured over it. Chicken chow mien tastes like cheap hotel food. Freezer chicken -not fresh tasting. The fried rice is sticky steamed rice \"fried\" (heated up) in soy sauce.  So why do I come here? My son loves it and I enjoy his company. It's more bout the bonding. Not too mention the service is good, friendly n quick. The appetizers are decent and I can ask for my pot stickers to be soft and not deep fried, which I'm not a fan of. The price is reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of combination plates and mixed it up with the DW. Chinese food throughout the US has been hit and miss for us... mainly miss. Pong Pong is fairly average. The beef and broccoli was probably the tastiest followed by the teriyaki chicken.

I like in particular that they're open later than most restaurants in the area, so you can still get fairly decent food even after most other places have closed."}
{"text":"Great Chinese restaurant
Restaurant is Clean food is fresh and flavorful.  
Support family owned and operated"}
{"text":"I've been going to Pong Pongs for almost 20 years. Take out, delivery and dine in.  Love the Sesame Chicken ( ask for extra spicy) Wor Won ton soup is a must. Especially when you're sick. Big portions! Always have left overs. And yummy egg rolls."}
{"text":"My favorite Chinese food in America. Maybe it's that I grew up on this place, ordering takeout on special occasions with my Mom and Dad. What you order is what you get and they are always spot on. You can almost always find a 20% discount coupon online if you search. My go to takeout."}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say, but I think this place was mediocre at best.  I always like to try little hole in the wall Chinese restaurants (which always tend to be the best compared to Chinese corporate america) but sadly I wasn't impressed.  
The price is cheap which is the only thing going for them (in my opinion) but the taste is very bland for the type of Chinese I was hoping they would be.
I will contradict myself for a moment and say that I will probably go back here for 2 reasons only...1 Location, 2 Cheap Price, but I would never recommend anyone to go here if they asked me for a good Chinese restaurant...hence my 2 stars."}
{"text":"Pong Pong wins again! My sister and I were on Bell Rd. and stopped in for lunch. We ordered a bowl of hot and sour soup. The huge bowl came to our table loaded with Chinese vegetables, soy and shrimp, enough for two to share. The combo we each chose was, lean thin sliced BBQ.pork, snow peas and lucious veggies, fluffy fried rice, came w/a perfect stuffed non greasy egg roll and wonton. Enjoyed the delicate hot tea. Too much to eat and took home to my hubby who loved it. Pong Pong is Chinese food at it's best like we got years ago. If you are on Bell Rd. stop in or place an order to go. We had the nicest watress who explained combo VS.non combo. You get a ton of food with the combo, a great deal at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"It's an ok place, came cuz it closes later than most chinese restaurants in my area. The prices are fair portions ehhh its ok, taste id say is fair not the greatest but not the worst I've eatn. Service, barely seen the server one of my water cups stayed empty.a no no im my book! Would i come bak? Umm, if nothing else is open lol..buuut probably not.."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for many years. Before and after vegetarianism I've never been dissapointed. They have a great price on lunch specials and their prices for dinner are reasonable as well. Authentic Chinese cuisine with ambience to match. There's a reason these guys have been here for so long and one visit will have you convinced. Never done take out but it's a nice option to have; the staff is always friendly as well. What's more, you can sub different sauces if you're eating healthy. Bell road is foreign food central!"}
{"text":"This place is great I've never been unhappy with there food.  They are not moderately priced . They are very consistent the food is always a great size portion."}
{"text":"Great lunch or dinner carry out. Lunch is very reasonably priced as is dinner combos. Been ordering from here for years. Always good."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the area and received coupons for Pong Pong in my welcome Valpak. I was nervous, but given I was now too away far to order from my old favorite restaurant, we decided to give Pong Pong a try with one of the coupons. We were NOT disappointed. 

My mom even remarked it was the BEST Chinese food she's ever had. Tonight, we ordered a second time, and the food was consistently as good as the first. The Sesame Chicken in particular is outstanding. My dad ordered the Shrimp Egg Foo Young, and also said that it was fantastic. 

Although I never see many people in the actual restaurant to eat, the counter always has several to go orders. This is our new fave for Chinese, and I'm so happy to have found such a great restaurant that is close to my house."}
{"text":"Not to my taste.  Grew up on real Chinese food in California and this is not it.  No flavor. Quality of both beef and chicken seemed low grade.  Fried Won Tons were not crispy.  Over an hour wait for delivery.  No return experience for me."}
{"text":"So, we have ordered from this place around 5 times. Twice for pickup. And the other three for delivery. They have yet to mess up an order. They're always nice to me and repeat back my order. They always say it'll be 45 minutes but its always been faster than that. 

We've tried their chicken, bbq pork, and veggie fried rice. They're all good. More so the bbq pork and veggie. I have ordered their sesame chicken (extra spicy) each time, but I ask for the sauce on the side, that way its not soggy by the time it makes its way to me. 

I have also ordered their Singapore noodles, which, I had no idea it comes with shrimp, beef, and chicken. I wasn't feeling meat so I kinda pushed it around to get to what I wanted. 

Their Sa-Te chicken skewers (again, ask for extra spicy here) are wonderful, along with their beef skewers. 

If something is fried, ask for the sauce on the side. If its \"spicy\" ask them to make it extra spicy. I honestly don't know why this place has shit reviews and not that much traffic. Unless I'm just not being that adventurous with their menu?"}
{"text":"Meh, was stuck in hotel and needed delivery.  Almond chicken was dark meat not awesome but edible, awesome chicken was not awesome but edible, egg drop soup was average, egg rolls not anything noteworhy....delivery was on time.  If you are stuck and need delivery you will be ok with this place, but if not go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Pong Pong has been a favorite for over 25 years. We found it one day when a group of coworkers went looking for a place for lunch. I've been coming back regularly since that time.

Good food, good prices and friendly staff add up to a great spot for a casual lunch or dinner with family and friends"}
{"text":"Really good food and they do offer delivery.  My husband LOVES the Amazing Chicken.  The Lemon Chicken is really good too.   Most of the time I would call ahead and stop by on the way home from work.  They do offer delivery so that is an added perk.
It is a strip mall restaurant that really needs to be updated so if you are seeking ambience you won't find it here.  If you want good basic chinese food then you will like this place alot."}
{"text":"Don't order from here! If they make a mistake on your meal they will say they'll fix it and take longer than the initial delivery took. Me and my gf decided to order here tonight and they forgot to put teriyaki sauce on teriyaki chicken because of course you order plain chicken from a Chinese place. So after an hour of waiting for just sauce as my chicken became no longer desirable we decide to go ask for our money back and instead of them offering to fix it they say they want the food back! Really?? You guys have no business in the food industry. Horrible customer service!!"}
{"text":"Long time fan of Pong Pong. I've been dining here for YEARS. I've moved out of the area but find myself craving their sesame chicken, so I make a point of driving over about once a month to pick up a to-go order. They are overshadowed by the mexican restaurant next door but don't let that deter you from giving them a try. Good food, excellent hospitality, at a great price."}
{"text":"Really good Chinese food!.  The Shrimp Fried Rice is wonderful!   It was like being back in NYC!"}
{"text":"Order sesame chicken lunch special, and it was horrible. The rice was dry and lacking flavor. Even my 7 year old daughter complained...."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the food we order and our check wasn't as high as we expected. It was really good food for a reasonable price I wouldn't mind coming back again! We order the Orange Beef and House Special Chow Main along with egg rolls, crab puff and soup. I loved the soup and appetizers!"}
{"text":"Love the bbq  fried rice and beef chop suey. Not a fancy place but great really happy I Found them 6 years ago from a co worker recommendation. Im just picking up dinner and realized they have not had a good review from me. Love they are open to 10pm"}
{"text":"I live this place. Has great food and very friendly staff. We not only get the delivery but we go there as well. Usually pretty empty with customers but they have great food."}
{"text":"I did research the feedback prior to visiting, though a friend at work sang their praises so I went anyway. Out of the three dishes, pork fried rice, twice cooked pork and orange chicken only the fried rice was even barely edible, and just. The twice cooked pork was ghastly, truly the worst I've ever had, greasy to the point of slimey with huge fatty slices more fat than pork with the altogether wrong spice and old veg. The orange chicken was also the worst I've ever had, the sauce was unappealing but it was the meat its self that ruined it utterly, like thawed out class c cuts of something clearly not chicken. the fried rice wasn't so horrible but tasted of  a burnt flavor and the pork in it that would have been fantastic if not for the actual rice that ruined it. My quest for decent Chinese food continues."}
{"text":"Pong Pong's is a great Chinese restaurant with super fast delivery, exceptional service and made-to-order food that is tasty, seasoned well and make for great leftovers.  Their AMAZING CHICKEN is AMAZING, and I order it with NO bok choy, NO snow peas and NO carrots and I order it to be mild.  You can make any dish SPICY or MILD and they will prepare it as you like it.  Their crab puffs are a sweet and tasty side dish to add to any entree.  You can get entrees al-a-carte or as a combo, which gives you a smaller portion but with an egg roll and a crab puff.  Even their combo portions are filling and delicious.  A large entree al-a-cart is less than $8.00 (even seafood), and they deliver with just a $10 order minimumand it's always hot (temperature-wise), fast and driver is always in good mood and none of my orders have EVER been messed up or wrong.  They even bring extra sauces and fortune cookies at no charge.  I highly recommend this place. And you can add water chestnuts or ANY vegetable or extra sauce to ANY order, and again, tell them you want it mild or extra spicy and they can do that for you,,,,for free!  Beef & Broccoli is another entree there that is POPULAR and tastes amazing.  Their meat is always so tender.  Call them today!  You won't regret it!  Eating in (35th Ave/Bell) or delivery is a positive experience anytime and they are very accomodating."}
{"text":"Prices never go up here on lunch specials. Service always excellent.  Wish the soup was hot hot, instead of luke warm.  I had happy family that comes with chicken, beef, shrimp in brown sauce, and nothing fried in it.  We go here once in a while."}
{"text":"Oh, Pong Pong, how far you have fallen...

I started ordering take out from Pong Pong about 8 years ago; then the food was of great quality, the best Chinese take out in the area. These days the quality is pretty lousy.  I just picked up some take out a few days ago and sad to say, I won't be coming back again.  

It feels like the owners have given up.  The interior has gotten dirtier with each visit. Seriously, if you stop in take a peep at your surroundings; the caller ID box and phone on the counter, the register, the handles on the beverage cooler, etc., they are all covered in black grime.  The people who touch this grime also handle your food.  The quality of the ingredients and the preparation of those ingredients has taken a major slide as well.  It seemed that several years ago, those doing the cooking had a sense of pride in their work, which resulted finesse in dishes that's unusual for typical Chinese-American fare.  You could tell subtle differences in preparation from one cook to the next...one would do the egg rolls a little peppery and spicy, the other would do them more vibrant and acidic.  Now it's all bland mush.

If you're looking for decent Chinese in the area, try Golden Rice Express, My Corner or any of the other offerings. None are as good as Pong Pong once was, but all are better than Pong Pong of the present.

I hate to give what was once a beloved staple such a poor review, but that's the way the fortune cookie crumbles."}
{"text":"Hubby had the flu and his idea of comfort food is wor wonton soup with house  mustard when he is sick.
This was my first time trying Pong Pong and it was pretty darn good.
The lady behind the counter was sweet and friendly. Our order was packed well for the drive home
I had the chicken, beef and shrimp lunch special. Plenty of food for the price, but there was no chicken at all.
Hubby loved the soup!
I really like the fact that the specials come with fried rice, not everywhere does that.
Eggroll was good, not greasy, not cold, nice and crispy.
The interior could use some updating, but I will probably be a take out diner."}
