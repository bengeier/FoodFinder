{"text":"This is the worst Thai Express I've ever been. The person behind me got their good first because they know the customer. Female cashier is kind of rude. Half dish of  Pad Thai I ordered was bean sprout.  Hot water was not prepared for tea."}
{"text":"We went to Thai Express on Markville Mall on Oct 26. It was a terrible experience. 1) the cashiers were busy chatting amongst themselves than to acknowledge our presence, 2) we ordered item #8 and while it was being made by the cooks, they were speaking vulgar languages in front of us!!! This is TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE 3) the food item wasn't cooked properly and we have to throw most of it out. This is really bad. I would never go to this location again nor will I ever recommend Thai Express to my friends. It was a total waste of $, experience. Even KFC would be much better....  MH"}
{"text":"This is one of the better food court places here in Markville and also a place that has customer service. The lady at the cashier was sick so I understand she wasnt 100% but the cook who served me was so nice! All smiles and a little bow for coutesy when he passed me my tray. Felt like home for a split second.   Mind you the portions here are pretty generous (for the pad thai) I couldn't finish it and ended up asking for a take outbox and bringing it home for dinner. It was just the perfect amount of noodles and bean sprout and I would've loved maybe 2 more slices of tofu hahaha. The extra spicy I got was okay (I like heat so maybe for people who don't have regular spicy dishes will find this pretty hot) I still wish it was hotter but I think that's asking for too much since they already have 4 lvls of spiciness heheh.   Thank you for having me and I'm glad I found a spot I can come for lunch on my break. See you next time!"}
{"text":"My kids like coming here for the soup noodles. They are ok, for a quick noodle fix. I've never tried the other fried noodle or rice dishes, but there is usually a big queue for those. The people that work there are really friendly too."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and I find it to be hit or miss. Returned here today because I have a sinus infection and for some reason, nothing makes me feel better when I'm feeling under the weather than some spicy Thai food. I ordered the chicken Thai curry and asked that it be made spicy. It wasn't spicy at all! I found the customer service to be less than stellar. I thought it might have been because the person at the counter didn't have great English but it seemed to be okay. However, she pointed at things, rather than explaining them and acknowledged me with as few words as possible."}
{"text":"Excellent Pad Thai at this location, the price is getting a bit high nowadays, but it's worth it. It isn't soggy with sauce like certain stores."}
