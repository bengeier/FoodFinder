{"text":"Love this place since the new owners took over. We go there about once a week. Wing night on Wednesdays are usually busy. Food is awesome and the best steak I have had in a long time. Fast and very friendly service."}
{"text":"Our first visit to this restaurant. For a small town pub the food was amazing. The starter of lobster stuffed mushroom caps was very delicious. My surf and turf burger was excellent. Nancy's Brie stuffed chicken was so good she commented that she wouldn't change a thing about it. We will definitely return and recommend this Tavern."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN!!! We have been going to this pub for a few years and has recently changed owners.  Will not go there again.  Since the new owners took over, and this was the third visit since then,  the restaurant is uncomfortably cold.  All three visits we needed to keep our coats on for warmth.  The food for a pub is good but not worth the drive for the nasty, unfriendly service.  I ordered a pasta dish and got whole wheat garlic toast (nothing specified it was whole wheat).  When I asked for it to be switched to white as I am allergic to whole wheal was was told off for not telling her of my allergy.  I though they should have specified whole wheat and even though I did not tell her, she did not need to tell me off or fight with me over getting white.  Told me they do not have white garlic bread, I would have been happy with just white toast. This was the owner's daughter and I related my concerns to her and she told me her daughter was short because it was very busy.  On top of being told off I had asked when we came in if I could plug in my cell as we had a major power outage at home, very accommodating at arrival and the phone landed back on the table uncharged after the bread request.  Nasty and vindictive behavior.  Tables full, but no one waiting for tables, and usually owners are happy for a busy restaurant.  I think these new owners have no experience with customer service or a restaurant (mother said she was a nurse).  No heat and bad customer service, will not go back and predicate they will be out of business or up for sale soon."}
{"text":"Typical sportsbar type restaurant. Service is great and food is what you would expect. It is great if you like burgers, fries, chicken wings and that kind of food. Small town and nothing else around here anyway. Maybe some more craft beer or decent wine might help."}
