{"text":"So I was in a hurry to catch a plane so I got a breakfast burrito to go and sat down at the long bar like table in the center of the restaurant to eat it quickly. The hostess told me I had to leave and sit at some other restaurant because they were only full service. The other section was full so I stayed in my seat and continued to eat. She the started acting like a complete bitch and insisted I had to order something or leave. I ordered a glass of water and she said something about only making four dollars an hour... Tough shit bitch, if you have it so bad try joining the military and you can see what real suffering looks like. The food was ok but pretty overpriced. Nothing new in a airport. As for attitude and service this place can't get much lower."}
{"text":"Holy Salt!!!!!! My god I couldn't eat my meal it was so salty. The shredded chicken was literally saltier than the ocean... Gross...   The server was cool though. And my Bloody Mary was good.   Drink here don't eat..."}
{"text":"So since that first burrito, I have been back a few times to try something new each time. And I have to say that the burritos haven't changed in taste or size lol. It's still yummy and still hefty enough to be shared. There was still a weird after taste but I found that it grew on me. The chicken burrito was yummy but I think I like the machaca burrito the best. Get a burrito with some salsa and some guac and I'm a happy girl."}
{"text":"Stopped here to watch a game and was happy I. I ordered some tacos (3 to an order). Tip: it's not on the menu but ask if you can get a \"sampler\" and pick 3 different types. I got the fish, shrimp and short rib tacos and was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Really slow service. Food is good but not worth the wait.  I waited 15 minutes for one breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Good drinks if you have Jeffrey as your bartender  . Pulse the quesadilla's are perfect for appetizers.."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good food at any airport, but this one is different. The food was great, so 4 stars for that; but we got lousy service, so I have to take away one star. Guacamole was fresh and tasty. Entre was good too. Sangria was a bit too sweet for my taste. I don't know what problem the waitress had with us right from the beginning. She was showing a lot of attitude even as we placed our order. She brought out the guacamole herself, and said the nachos would follow. 5 minutes later we were still waiting for the nachos. The manager was passing by, and he noticed that we were trying to grab her attention; and he helped us himself. This repeated later as well."}
{"text":"10 minutes before a waitress even said hello to me.  Not great when you are on a schedule.  The tacos are decent,  but the service is cruddy.   Definitely wouldn't come here for a drink if there were ANY other choice."}
{"text":"We love the Blanco down in Tucson so since we had a longer layover today we decided to eat here. The food is great! We got chips and guac, which the guac seems to be a smaller size than the one back at home. Still amazing though! I got the Mexican chopped salad and my husband got tacos, which we both thoroughly enjoyed!  I was not really a fan of our waiter... He was in a rush and not friendly at all. Didn't even introduce himself to us, just came up and asked us if we knew what we want."}
{"text":"This is one of my tops for tacos, this is great for a weekend nite and for dates because of the setup.  Good food and wine selection"}
{"text":"You'd never know you were in an airport with the awesome quality of service and food.  Highly recommend the Huevos Rancheros. It is one giant portion of beans, cheese, peppers, onions and two fried eggs with an awesome sauce all over it.  Their coffee was pretty good too."}
{"text":"Egg and steak burrito, minus the cheese and tortilla. Overall not bad, portion was good and potatoes crispy, steak was a little tough. Only issue i had was kitchen staff with facial hair were not wearing facial hair nets. Don't know if that's a food handlers rule or not but I found it a little gross."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and service is excellent (and speedy if you're short on time). I ordered the chicken fajitas. Chicken was seasoned well and and there were tons of onions and peppers at the bottom of the skillet that added to the goodness. Fajitas are topped with a fresh salsa and parsley garnish. Actual tacos are on the smaller side but they provide 6, which is plenty.   Overall; great food, great service, great experience. Exceeded my expectations.   *Located in Terminal 4, between gates A4-A5"}
{"text":"This place probably has the most Americanized Mexican food you can find. Bland, absolutely no flavor. I ordered the Mexican salad and it was tasteless. The chips and salsa were even bland and it's pretty hard to mess those up. I wont be returning anytime soon. I wish I could find an authentic Mexican place in Scottsdale but it seems to be a difficult task."}
{"text":"Yum!  That about sums it up!  They have a great happy hour too! Great patio, great location, great food, great prices!  Heading there now!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the food poisoning, Blanco. My entire family has spent the day puking in our hotel room instead of outside at Disneyland today. It was definitely you, because that was the only meal we have shared in days prior to this."}
{"text":"What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't serve chips and salsa? You can order chips and guacamole, you can order a side of salsa for your entree, but you can't order chips & salsa together? Wth... Service not so great either, manager checking out guests, rude servers and slow service. Too bad I wanted to like it... I like the restaurant in Phoenix, so I was excited to try in the a/p... Mistake! BTW... I did ask for chips & salsa"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed it, pleasant to sit outside, the music is just loud enough that it covers the road noise but so loud you can't have a conversation.  Really tasty tacos - both the chicken and the pork. Good margaritas especially the blood orange one. Friendly and efficient service even when it was very busy on a Saturday night. Would happily go back."}
{"text":"Nice place for some pre-flight drinks! I can't speak for the food, but the menu looked very nice! The prices were very reasonable especially for an airport bar."}
{"text":"I can't think of restaurant that I've been to that is as poorly ran as this place.  First it takes over 10 minutes for a server to even recognize your existence - and this is at a high top with about 15 people sitting at it.  Then your food to comes out before your drink which is scary that they can \"make\" fajitas faster than they can open a corona.   After the food I decided I had some time to kill still and wanted another drink and chips and salsa.  Drink came reasonably quick that time chips and salsa took 17 minutes.  And no they weren't freshly made.  This place deserves to be out of business"}
{"text":"If you're going to put tequila in the name of your restaraunt you should probably make a decent drink. The margaritas were terrible and my beer was skunked. The server was fast and polite and the food was okay but this far from made up for the terrible overpriced drinks."}
{"text":"Horrible service! We waited over 20 minutes to get a beer and were never served. We asked for water and didn't even get that. Go there if you want to waste your time!"}
{"text":"Wife's food good. Mine fair. Waitress bad ! Parked in adjacent parking lot , waitress to validate parking ticket, didn't and couldn't leave parking lot. This sucks! Can't even buy ticket ! Had to back and get ticket/ token to leave! Not going back!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid burrito for an airport location.  I've had breakfast burritos and lunch/dinner ones here too. Never disappointed"}
{"text":"Food so far has been good. But the service was beyond slow took 30+ minutes to get food for 4 people."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, this place is great! I was so pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and the service that I have since decided that I no longer hate this airport. I was promptly seated and showed where an outlet was under my table, should I need it. Nice! My waitress was SO friendly and helpful and was actually enthusiastic about the food. She also asked if I preferred sweet or not so sweet cocktails and gave me food suggestions. I seriously couldn't believe I was in an airport as she described the marination process of the shrimp.   The drinks were great and the food was actually mighty tasty. The guac was fresh: sprinkled with cotija and cilantro, and the chips house-made. The shrimp chopped salad was bursting with different flavors and a really good-sized portion. I was super-stuffed by the end of the meal. Also, they let me hang out there for three hours and did not once rush me or pressure me to leave. So if you have to eat in the Phoenix airport, go here, seriously. (Terminal 4 - A gates)"}
{"text":"I almost never write reviews and certainly not for airport restaurants. But, I was here last week while flying out of Phoenix and I was so impressed! Best huevos rancheros I have ever had. Hands down. I ordered it with the eggs over easy, the corn toritlla and added chorizo. It was amazing - savory, fresh, spicy but not hot. I would make a point of coming back to this place anytime I fly in or out of Phoenix."}
{"text":"This was surprisingly good airport food. I had the mushroom tacos and chips and salsa. You do have to pay extra for chips, but the overall bill was very reasonable for the airport. The ice tea was delicious and I seriously had at least 6 glasses because the service was so good and a weekend at the track leaves me thirsty!  I don't however, have anything good to say about American Airlines."}
{"text":"If the walk up window is closed they force you to order at the bar and charge you more. Not happy."}
{"text":"I hate the Scottsdale location and Biltmore location is passable. Airport Blanco is superior for both food and service. Ask for Jodi."}
{"text":"Food tastes good but they consistently run out of vegi options. Tonight, they are out of mushroom tacos... But wait, they are also out of beans (this a Mexican restaurant, right?) so a bean & cheese burrito is out of the question as well.  Last time, it was a breakfast debacle where they didn't have beans so no vegi options either.  The only thing available was covered in cheese. The few times they have had food, it was tasty. I would give a 3/5 for food but a 1/5 for selection."}
{"text":"Had the flan. So so delicious. Big enough portion for two to split. A little pricy but SO worth it. Nice environment. Had okay service. Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"Came to the bar..... had a few vodka sodas and had a chance to meet a great couple by the name of Jake and Heather from Philly! Best part of it all we created a new drink called the Rhode Island, the bartender Jenny hooked it up. Hit me up @robspaulding4@me.com"}
{"text":"I stop in whenever I can.  Love this place and Douglas the bartender in particular.  I fly nearly every week so I am here often.  Prices are airport decent and the food good and timely"}
{"text":"Totally in a hurry due to flight delays. Grabbed a short rib burrito to take on the flight, it was tasty! Shout out to the nice young lady with the short hair working the counter on 8/4/16 as she dealt well with my overall sense of \"traveler's frustration\", lol.  Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Passed through the airport for like, 25 minutes, and I've been through a LOT of airports.  The person behind the counter was actually NICE, instead of having that dull look airport workers have.  And the food was a-maz-ing.  I recommend the short rib tacos."}
{"text":"They have both a take out section (burritos/tacos/chips/simple salads) and a sit down section, which has a bigger mrenu. I ordered the shrimp salad. Crunchy textures and nicely cooked shrimp. Generous portion of salad. Cilantro lime vinaigrette had good flavor. But unfortunately, the dressing and shrimp were both too salty. Please cut down on the salt for your customers. I had to ask for three refills of water!"}
{"text":"I usually have a voracious appetite during my layovers and chose to eat here on the way back from LA to JFK. I was super tempted to order the bloody maria but ended up ordering the nachos and quesadilla instead. I asked if it was possible to add a side of guacamole to the nachos, and they ended up just bringing me the whole guacamole and chips appetizer, so there was a whole lot of chips overload going on with my meal. Prices were OK and I wish there was an add on option instead of having to order an entire appetizer when I just wanted a little guacamole. The guac was OK. It was a little bland. The nachos didn't have the usual melted cheese but the liquid nacho cheese kind that you normally see at Taco Bell or 7-11. All in all it was just an OK meal. The staff was kind and attentive, so extra stars for that."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Sat here for 10 min before even being acknowledged. Nice make server helped us, Victor. The women were cold and rude. Wouldn't recommend it unless he helps you."}
{"text":"To be honest, writing a review for Blanco was not on my mind last month when I was looking for a quick bite to eat before catching my flight.  It had been a long day and I was ready to fall asleep once I boarded the plane.  However, when I got back home and finally got around to submitting a work expense reimbursement, I realized I had forgotten to grab the itemized receipt from my meal.    I did not see a phone number listed for this particular location, so I reached out via Yelp to see if perhaps they could help me get an itemized receipt.  Jon A. responded within the hour, and within a few minutes of giving him the necessary information to find my transaction I had a copy of my itemized receipt waiting for me in my inbox.   Next time I pass through the Phoenix airport I will be sure to stop by Blanco-Jon certainly did not have to take time out of his day to quickly find my measly $20 receipt, but the fact that he did so in less time than I spent at his restaurant means that he has my business as a repeat customer.  Thank you Jon!"}
{"text":"What a treat! Had green chilie tacos.  Delicious. Even the beans and rice sides were tasty. Left soothed, comforted and ready to take on the usual the airport stress."}
{"text":"Food has a good flavor.   Staff is slow and kind of zoned out (2 bar tenders standing there talking rather than taking orders and refilling drinks).  Portions are small and over priced. It's in the airport so you don't have much of an alternative.  If all of the staff members were a bit friendlier and more attentive, I'd say 4 stars. Drop the prices by 20% and you'd have a 5 star airport dining experience."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. So surprised for an airport terminal location. The chicken burrito was well made with just enough spice. Side of  black beans and rice finished it"}
{"text":"Very unexpected surprise at the Phoenix Airport. Service was excellent on a crowded Friday night. Food was actually really good and waitress could not have done any more to assist. Pork taco was as good as I have ever had."}
{"text":"Only place on the A gate side of the airport to get a good drink and people watch while eating some tasty Mexican food. Cholula everywhere, that's my favorite side chick. Large tequila selection if you're lookin to booze through you next flight.   Also, the larger tables beside the bar have outlets to charge your electronics. Necessity for anyone needing juice. Unfortunately no Wifi. Five stars if that were the case."}
{"text":"I travel a lot, and so spend a lot of time in airport restaurants.  Now, those that travel a lot know that airport establishments can be a little on the lacking side when it comes to food quality as the need for speedy delivery and production usually results in mediocre offerings.  The reason I like this place is that some of the staple items I like to eat are done well here.  Specifically the Nachos appetizer and the Steak & Egg Fajitas.  Both items are very tasty.  The only downside is that the meat additions to the nachos can be a little salty.  Service is usually good, with no complaints.  Pros: Good offerings so far.  Decent service, especially for an airport environment. Electrical plugs EVERYWHERE, even under the seats.  Cons: Can be noisy and it is hard to carry on a phone conversation here.  If hit at the peak flight arrivals, can be very busy and tight for seating."}
{"text":"Awesome,clean, and modern. Fish tacos and cheese crisp were delicious and fresh. Margarita was legit. They make the mix in house, fresh and prepared well. The service at the bar was excellent (Twilight was my bartender) despite how incredibly busy they were ( packed house). The one thing they need is better music.  Sounds like background music at the underwear section of Macy's. Please change your music."}
{"text":"Service is lazy and apathetic. They simply couldn't even make the effort to clear tables in order to seat people in a timely manner. The hosting staff was worse; condescending and rude. Cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Extremely mediocre at best.  Prepackaged Guacamole was terrible and couldn't finish it. Had three tacos (green chile pork, chicken and carne asada). The pork was the best but all three were forgettable - tiny too. It's unfortunate that this airport hasn't figured out how to service a captive audience with decent food."}
{"text":"Best Airport Mexican Food Ever! Trust me."}
{"text":"Place was pretty busy yesterday at 12:30 but still had open seats and tables. Seated near the front. Waited 10 minutes, was never served (no drink order, no food order, no nothing!) and had to get something to go from elsewhere before heading for my flight. Will never go back to this restaurant and will tell everyone I know who flies through Sky Harbor to do the same."}
{"text":"If only this place wasn't on the wrong side of security, I'd consider going over to the airport for dinner more often.  That's how good this place is.  Carnitas tacos are delicious, staff is friendly and prompt, and they have conveniently provided outlets all over the place for charging your devices while you wait for your flight."}
{"text":"Bad service - but not really the servers fault but that of the person scheduling staffing.  Not enough wait staff to take orders but 4 people standing around at the check in desk  to seat people - I think two would be enough for that job and have the other two wait tables."}
{"text":"After a terrible day in the air with two flight cancellations and delays I ended up in Phoenix on my way to the Bay Area. The servers, mine was Anthony was so considerate, and the tacos were fabulous."}
{"text":"A good choice at the Phoenix airport. Fajitas were very good for airport food and service was quick and friendly. Way better than La Madeline."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazingly buttery burritos due to the copious amounts of butter they but in their rice. Not good for you but so delicious."}
{"text":"I'm confused as to why this place has such a high rating.  What I ordered was the most tasteless burrito I have ever eaten in my life.  Not to mention the salsa was pretty bland as well.  The wait staff was awesome though! They smiled and they were really helpful. Part of the reason why I didn't complain about the food while at the restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite place at PHX airport. I recommend their mexican chopped salad. It comes with guacamole. They have a decent collection of beers, not too many beers on the tap. This place can get busy sometimes."}
{"text":"So I guess I do like Mexican food...Blancos was really good!    We stood in their fast food line, called Blancos on the Fly, to pick up quick bites during our layover.  The line almost spilled out into the terminal but it moved quickly.  The menu options at the walkup line were limited to:  Chips & Guacamole  3 Cheese Quesadillas (made of Oaxaca, Asadero and Manchego cheeses with an option to add chicken or machaca beef for an extra $2)  Three burrito options (made with black beans, cilantro rice Mexican cheese and pico) ---Carnitas Burrito (braised pork with tomatillo and green chiles) ---Chicken Burrito (slow roasted chicken with caramelized onion and peppers) ---Machaca Burrito (braised short rib beef with tomato and green onion)  My quesadilla was simple but delicious...loaded with tender chicken and gooey cheeses.  The chicken was slightly spicy and so moist that a dribble of juice ran out when I took a bite.  It was much more flavorful than cardboard quesadillas I've had in the past.  The thing was huge too--cut into four pizza sized slices that barely fit the takeout container.    The boy ordered a fat burrito that was packed with chicken.  I didn't taste it but apparently it was so good that he wouldn't put it down so I could snap a photo.  He did mention that one side of the burrito was cold and the other was warm. Not sure how that could be avoided when you're wrapping cooked foods with fresh ones.  It certainly didn't stop him from demolishing the wrap in record time.  I hesitated to stop at Blancos but I'm glad we did.  Lunch was filling and bursting with flavor.  They make it easy to grab a tasty lunch and still get to your gate on time."}
{"text":"OK... it's airport food. It's expensive ($9.75 for a burrito including tax). But it's probably the best airport food I've ever had."}
{"text":"Ok, totally surprised!  This the first time a restaurant Manager has called me to talk about my experience and fixing it.  I am giving them a 3 star and I will come by again to give them another chance.  Thank you Brett....I look forward to adding more stars when I visit soon."}
{"text":"Shauna was such a great server! Great customer service in general, new favorite spot to hang out at sky harbor! Foods always on point!"}
{"text":"Best airport food ever! During a layover to Cabo, decided to start the fiesta early. Excellent chips/guac and delicious chicken tortilla soup, washed down with a refreshing Barrio blonde. Fast, polite service."}
{"text":"This is a great place ......our bartender Tina was awesome and made some very good menu suggestions. ....I will definitely stop here again when I fly"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and the food came fast.  The food itself was great as well.  Great quick meal to have before a flight!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed in Blanco tacos in the Phoenix airport. When we sat at the bar, the bartender and older woman (Mrs. Collins- I only saw her last name) did not even greet us. She placed beverage napkins in front of us and just looked at us waiting for us to order without giving us menus or drink options. We asked for menus and I ordered a margarita (which turned out to be the worst Margarita I've ever had- it was very sour and I watched her pour the tequila...she put a drop of patron and little Jose Cuervo.) She didn't return to get our food order so we had to flag her down and she ordered our food and never checked back. I couldn't drink the margarita because it was so sour and she never came back to check on us so we flagged down another friendly bartender who quickly made a different cocktail and helped change our experience (which is the reason I'm giving 2 stars opposed to 1)"}
{"text":"A welcome change from typical airport fare. Their take-away counter redeemed an otherwise noxious trip. It's still ridiculous airport prices but I demolished that burrito."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent flyer and try (past tense) to hit this place up as often as possible.  Unfortunately this morning the waiter forgot to actually place my order.  So instead of a relaxing preflight meal, I ended up inhaling my meal before my flight boarded. And no, they didn't offer to comp or discount my meal.  Time to find another airport restaurant."}
{"text":"I am a margarita and tequila snob so I rarely order out. However, I was craving one while in the airport.  The place was packed but as soon as I was approaching the door a nice waitress started waiting on me.  She asked if I wanted a chair near an outlet to charge any of my devices and took me right to a seat.  I wasnt going to order food but it looked good at the other tables.  As it turned out the home made guac and drinks were great.  The tacos were amazing and you could custom order them to your taste.  So you might be asking why not 5 stars then.  I understand I was also in an airport and everything is usually higher priced but it was even a bit more pricey than I expected.  Still kinda of worth it though.   If my gate is near there I will go back.  But if my gate it a bit away I might look for more of a bargain.  After all, it was just tacos and tequila.    But yum."}
{"text":"Despite decent salad and drink, our waitress ruined our meal. A manager accidentally spilled a margarita on my friend. Accidents happen. But that was a cue to try to make it a better experience. Our waitress refused to write down our order and then fouled it up. My friend ordered a chicken salad and was delivered one. But the waitress oddly argued it was a steak salad, wanted to charge her as such and then said, \"That's OK, I just won't charge you for the steak.\" I went through the same argument about the mythical chicken she was certain was on my salad. Even after I showed her no such chicken was actually on salad. Nonetheless, she reminded me, she would still need to charge me for the chicken. Both of our salads had beans. Per the meal's hidden theme, no beans arrived. When we asked, she reminded us they were out of beans. No such conversation happened -- and there were two diners and one waitress -- so I feel we have reality on our side. When we'd had enough of having her argue with us about our meals, she told me not to worry that I was wrong, she wouldn't charge us. And then called me \"Sweetie.\" If you want to be the trapped monkey in someone else's circus, go sit in her station"}
{"text":"Blech, got a grab and go salad and an order of chips and guacamole.  Nothing good to say about either.  The salad had shredded tortilla strips and they were stale and soggy.  The dressing was odd and possibly spoiled.  The guacamole tasted as if it had at least one rotten avocado mixed in.    Yuck, just no.  Airport food, yay- NOT!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken tacos with black beans and rice . They were really good. Surprised to find something more than average at an airport."}
{"text":"Wow! I'm not a Yelper but sitting here at the Phoenix airport and feeling fortunate to have a long enough layover to enjoy a sit down breakfast before a long flight -- and get food far above my expectations. I wish all airport food and service was this good."}
{"text":"What more can you say than shots of tequila and tacos before you head out on a week long vacation. We stopped here before we flew east for a cruise and had a good time in the process. The food was pretty good, service was a bit rushed but expected at an airport. There are plenty of outlets for charging up your phone too, so look around."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service. My wife and I stopped in to kill some time during a layover on the way home yesterday, and to enjoy the airport version of Arizona's version of Mexican cuisine. She had an awesome enchilada-style burrito and I had some green chili soft tacos that were really great, washed down by a Tecate. Aubrey was a great server and her friendliness and attentiveness went a long way to make us feel welcome in the midst of the sea of airport-traveler humanity. Will be back the next time I fly through PHX."}
{"text":"Hours are listed til 11pm...busy bar and still pouring drinks but not allowing any new customers in as of 9:12pm. It is a Tuesday night, but there are many other travelers in the terminal...and no other options for a beer before my flight that is an hour away. The airport should require they remain open until at least ten if there are no other choices. I could have stopped before passing through security had I known their posted hours were inaccurate. I work in hospitality and would completely understand if they were very slow and chose to close at a reasonable time, but 9:12pm is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for chicken nachos during layover.    Food was good and tasty.   Service was very quick."}
{"text":"Cheryl is a true asset to the establishment. The food is great, but her professional, courteous service made our experience perfectly was ask for her. You'll be glad you did"}
{"text":"Proper Mexican food. The guacamole had charred poblano chiles incorporated in it and was sprinkled with cotija cheese. I had the grilled Mahi tacos and was not disappointed. The black beans were cooked and seasoned perfectly.   My only complaint was that the rice was cooked in way too much butter. However, all-in-all a GREAT little oasis of Mexican cuisine bliss if you've got some time in Terminal 4 at the Phoenix Airport."}
{"text":"Airport grub in Phoenix with a decent representation of Mexican food, tequila, and beers. Enjoyed a beer and street tacos with grilled fish. Perfect size, great flavor, and made fast to order. Seems they were out of a couple of things but oh well..... The place was packed with weary travellers."}
{"text":"The burritos are very good and quite filling. They come with potatoes also. The skillet eggs are also very tasty. All the wait staff was overly kind. Worth a stop if you like a Mexican breakfast flavor!"}
{"text":"OK, so I go to airport bars pretty regularly.  In fact, recently at Sky Harbor, I've had to go to a couple of those \"stand up\" bars (where there are only 4 or 5 seats and everyone just stands around).  So, I have come to lower my expectations.  At least at these \"stand up\" bars, you can be served fairly quickly.    This is where my beef begins with Blanco Tacos and Tequila (Spelled wrong on Yelp btw, pretty sure there is only one L in Tequila).  I have 20 minutes before my flight and I would like to get a drink.  Not a lot to ask, right?  Though there are open seats at the bar, we are still required to wait in line.  In fact, give our names and then stand awkwardly outside this poor excuse for an airport bar.  This wouldn't be so bad if I didn't see entire groups of people bypassing this rule and sneaking in and taking large tables when the hostess wasn't paying attention.  After 15 minutes, I finally was offered a seat at a crowded and dirty mutual table.  I asked if I could have one of the open seats at the bar, and the hostess, who didn't seem to care at all, just said \"fine\".  After another few awkward minutes of trying to send smoke signals to one of the three bartenders, I was asked if I wanted a drink.  \"What kind of vodka do you have?\"  \"Well...\"  \"OK, can I get a Kettle One and soda?\"  \"Sure...\"  And she then proceeds to sneak over to what is obviously a bottle of Skyy vodka and pour my drink.  At this point, there were about 2 minutes before my flight boarded, so I didn't say anything.  I had my credit card waiting on the bar when she got back from her failed trick.  \"Is that it?\"  \"Yes.  Please close me out.\"  (Reluctantly)...  \"OK.\"  You know that there is only one bar per terminal section, right?  Next time, I will just hike over to another section and fight my way into a stand up bar just to avoid this awful, awful place."}
{"text":"FABBO food service and Margaritas.  ( Hi Sandra... a YELP Lover)  Tacos hit the spot.  Margaritas even more so! Perfect.  Ok let's go. X"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast burrito (I actually shared part if it, as it was a decent size), and the caramel flan was absolutely delicious.  The quality was naturally far higher than a fast food breakfast burrito from Sonic or McDonald's.  This abbreviated Fox concept is a great break from the Burger King and McDonald's airport food of my childhood!    It also made me a little sad to see Modern Burger still around after the sad, partly self-inflicted demise of Modern Steak and it's Modern Burger window at Scottsdale Fashion Square.  Ah, memories."}
{"text":"If u love Mexican food, and have had good Mexican food, do not come here.  A 17 dollar carne asada burrito came barely warm and with next to no flavor.  Huge disappointment...Respect your taste buds and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Jill Lee doesn't play around when it comes to the double!!!!!!! She floats through the bar like a plane floats in the sky. Blancos is where you can find her"}
{"text":"While waiting for our flight my husband and I ordered the chips and guacamole. My husband asked for a Hendricks martini because he has had them here before while waiting for a business flight, but was told they do not have Hendricks. I ordered the rojo sangria which was very good.  The guacamole could have been seasoned better, in the sense that there was none. Our server was very attentive and pleasant..  Would I come back? Possibly, as there aren't many options for drinks and food in that area."}
{"text":"I expected a lot more from a fox concept. Blanco at the airport used to be great but recent trips have shown that the service has gone downhill. Everything from the wrong order, salt on rim when sugar is requested, and servers taking forever despite slow business. The chips have also been very salty recently.   Sadly I'd skip over to Olive and ivy or modern burger."}
{"text":"Wouldnt last a month at any normal location...waitress is slow and lazy...I can't remember the last time I didn't leave some kind of tip, but that's what went down here. Also...FYI \"fresh guac\" ingredients sitting uncovered in the corner with flies"}
{"text":"Best park carnitas ever. Get the meal for delectable rice and wash down with a blood orange margarita."}
{"text":"Worst service ever. My flight was delayed so I thought I'd stop by Blanco (it was close to my gate) for a bite to eat. I was seated right away but then waited 10 minutes before I could get the attention of a server. It seems that the server in my section selfishly decided to take an impromptu/unscheduled break and 'no one' was assigned to my table. While I waited (along with other customers who had not been served), 4 staff members (yes 4!) ignored attempts to gain their attention and stood at the host stand yukking it up and avoiding eye contact. Not impressed, if it hadn't been for Anda taking the initiative and stepping up I would have left. I will never come back...no matter how long I'm delayed in Phx"}
{"text":"Don't be deceived by the time they close. They close whenever they want to and don't care about turning away customers who just arrived on a flight.  9:30 on a Saturday night?  Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Airplane has better food. Guacamole and chips served in a cereal bowl? I'm not sure the nachos and cheese even add real cheese. Good place for drinks"}
{"text":"Best tacos ever, best margaritas ever and best waitstaff especially Debra who is so helpful and the best bartender."}
{"text":"I generally always give 5 stars when needed and only 1 star when also needed.    I walked up to the host and wasn't greeted in a friendly way.  It was more like hey bro, you want a 1 top table?  I said yea, bra I just need a table.  The host then just turned around, mind you there is only 20 tables in about a 25x25 area, then said we just gave the last one up.  I was staring directly at a table to his right that needed to be bussed.  He then said oh you want that 4 top?  I told him i just needed a table,so I can eat and work on my laptop.  I was sat, the menu was placed face down, and he left without saying anything.    It took the server a few minutes to get to me, which wasn't the awkward part.  The awkward part was listening him tell the table across from me that they are almost out of everything and that there kitchen was closing quickly.  When my server came to my table, he didn't introduce himself, nor did he really great me.  It was just \"can I get you a drink\" so I asked for a diet coke.  I then asked him what the kitchen was out of, but by the time I finished my sentence, he had already walked away.  I had to call him back to the table to find out what the kitchen was out of.  I had to ask him what the kitchen was out of, and he really didn't say anything other then beef and maybe chicken.    He came back a few minutes later with a water, which I didn't ask for.  I placed my order and while I was doing it he wasn't writing it down.  After I placed my order he tried to repeat it back to me, but forgot an item so I had to repeat my order. While I was waiting for my food to come, the table was grumbling and looking for a manager.   They couldn't find one, but ask for the check and they had the same waiter as me.  That waiter went to the host stand and started explaining to the host how he wanted the dinning room floor sat as it was to benefit  him the way he explained it to the host.  So about 6 minutes after the table next to me asked for their check he left the host stand and the table had to ask him again for the check.  I got my food in a timely manner for sure, and the girl that dropped it off was friendly.  My food isn't bad, but the queasily is boring nothing special.  My salad was very normal and I will give it an excellent rating for the use of square Doritos chips.   My burrito was good, but the carnitas needed to be cooked longer.   Now I have been done eating for about 10 minutes, and my server never checked in on me to see how my food was, nor has my table been pre-bussed.    1.  You are in an airport, so running out of food isn't a reason to close early. 2.  If you are going to close early get your story straight with your staff.  The would tell one person they had no food, the next guest he would tell it was inventory night.   3.  Why would you stop seating for your dinner menu at 8:45 in the middle of a holiday travel season.   4.  The managers walked around looking like he was shelled shocked and seemed to checked out.    So if this Blanco is owned by a real restaurateur and you have franchised out your brand to the airport, I would pull your contract with the airport.  They are doing your brand extremely poor justice.  I doubt the previous sentence is what is actually going on here.  This airport should really re-think its customer service skills and find a couple of good real restaurant people to get this place into shape.    FYI, now at 25 minutes after finishing my food and my server still has not come back to collect my plates or check in on me."}
{"text":"The service is horrible. Food is okay for being at the airport.  For being at an airport you would expect them to move fast and have a variety of dishes, not this day. Sold out of everything except soft tacos. The tacos were good but not worth the wait and bad service."}
{"text":"I normally ask to sit in Christinas section because I fly out of here a lot and she is great. Always attentive and never lets your drink go empty or makes you wait for the check. When I dont see her working I will only sit at the bar and have had great service from Thomas there. The food is good and you can take your burrito to go. They also have a full bar...a must at any airport."}
{"text":"For an airport restaurant, it's 5 stars. Fast service, great food. Chicken tortilla soup was awesome as was the machca tacos."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice as I passed through Shy Harbor Airport.  The servers have been friendly, the food pretty good, but of course at airport prices.  The chopped salad I had on my second visit was outstanding, and my server exceptional.  I will say that I wish I was told that you can mix and match the tacos, although the pork tacos I had on my first visit were decent.  So if you are waiting for a flight in Phoenix, consider giving Blanco's a try."}
{"text":"Had 90 min between flights. Had 2 Patron Margaritas, Shrimp Taco plates. AWSOME FOOD , GREAT DRINKS and STELLAR SERVICE !! A bit pricy ($58 for two of us ) but everything at any airport is on the higher side !! Will definitely visit again as a frequent flyer !! Located in the American Airlines Terminal 4 Num num"}
{"text":"TLDR: Skip the guacamole, go straight to the caramel flan. And they're totally cool with laptops!  The menu: Skip the \"must-try\" guacamole. It looks like grocery store guacamole was scooped with an ice-cream scoop, then sprinkled with feta on top. The salsa was fine, but the chips were sooooo salty I had to wash them down with so much water.  Speaking of salty... the Tortilla Soup was the saltiest thing I've tasted in a long time. And it was so thick I think it was more along the lines of a lentil soup than a tortilla soup.  But... there's a silver lining. The Caramel Flan was a-mazing and I would come back for it again. The fruit was a nice balance to the creamy caramely flan.  Service & wifi: Service was pretty good. I know they have to deal with a lot of weird schedules given that it's in an airport, so I appreciated that they accommodated me and my laptop so nicely. The host showed me to a table right beside a power outlet, and made me feel welcome to stay and work as long as I needed. It was 1pm on a weekday, and I think most restaurants would not have been as accommodating. That was a nice plus!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Blanco Tacos and Tequila during a short layover in Phoenix. The restaurant was very busy, but we were able to find a seat. Our waiter, Victor, was great. He was very friendly and efficient. He took our order and promptly brought our drinks over. We ordered: sparkling water, margaritas, chips and guacamole, and steak tacos. When we found out that our flight was actually leaving, Victor was so helpful. Our food hadn't arrived yet, so he had it packed to go and even brought me a sparkling water to go! The food itself was pretty good - I didn't get to eat it until a while later, so it was cold, but still pretty tasty. The next time I have to have a layover in Phoenix and happen to be in this terminal, will stop by again!"}
{"text":"Stopped in Phoenix on my way to Cali, check this spot out on Cinco De Mayo. Had a blast, staff hella cool, conversates often and really attentive. If you in Phoenix AP, drop by and grab a beer and some grub! Muy Bueno!!!"}
{"text":"carnitas burrito with cilantro, rice, black beans waa great!!!"}
{"text":"I'd rate this a 3.5, but gave it a 4 on here because of the service. I sat at the bar where the bartender was very attentive, fast, and friendly.   The margaritas and chicken quesadillas were pretty good for airport food and drinks."}
{"text":"Good tacos, good margaritas and sitting outside on a beautiful late fall day in Arizona...it doesn't get much better than that.  My parents really liked it.  They had plenty of taco combinations to satisfy all three of us including enough to make us want to come back, and an excellent margarita selection.  Plus, the wait staff was very friendly.  We had just hiked Squaw Peak, and our waitress recommended that we try hiking Camelback next time."}
{"text":"Had an hour for a layover and was up all night on the previous flight. Ordered 2 egg and cheese breakfast burritos to go to split among 4 people. Just the right amount of food and filling. Almost didn't get the salsa, but the cashier asked and decided to get it on a whim.  Make sure to get the salsa because it gives a added layer of flavor that without was a bit bland for my taste. Overall, not bad given its airport food."}
{"text":"Wow, we were so impressed with this place! My breakfast burrito was DELICIOUS ad had a great local beer called the kiltslinger.. And the meal was large and reasonably priced! So large I have a nice leftover to take in the plane since on US Airways you can't have food or even a small snack without being charged for it.  Unbelievable.  The atmosphere was nice with TVs playing sports everywhere and our waitress was really nice. She even took a special requests from me to remove peppers and add chicken to my dish.  This place really surpassed expectations for an airport bar. It is now up there with that fox sports bar in Charlotte as one of my favorites."}
{"text":"My wife and I were really impressed by this restaurant. We always drive by it, but now we'll make a point to actually go in!  The patio is perfect.  Happy Hour only goes until 6 PM, but frankly I'd pay more to sit on their comfy couches and just enjoy the scenery.  The food is terrific.  I tried three different types of tacos, and all were great.  We also shared a Cheese Crisp and some Sopapillas.  YUM.  Can't wait to come back.  ENJOY!"}
{"text":"This place was great fun. It's in a hot location in the airport, so it was really busy - and fun to meet other travelers. I met SEVERAL people sitting here for about an hour - and they were super fun and made my layover a million times better than so so many more before it. The food was pretty average (mushroom tacos). The service was GREAT. The beer list and wine list were average. The atmosphere was beyond fun. So, to me, it was one of the best places I have been during a layover. I actually feel like it makes me want to fly through Phoenix - just so I can go to this place. I'm sure that there are slower times when this place isn't as fun, and that the fact that the food and booze is average is a little more apparent. But if it's busy, then it's fun. And fun is the name of the game in life - this place has it."}
{"text":"Amazing white Mexican rice like grandma makes. Beautiful tequila menu and Crazy good price for a 3 hour lay over... Just do it... Lyle Silicon Valley california"}
{"text":"Though Nachos and Salsa is very cheap, the waitress offered bottomless Salsa, which made me very happy because I put a lot of Salsa on Nachos. And the main meal, Fish Tacos, was very good, too! Get to the airport early enough to enjoy a full service. You can charge your device if you get a sofa sheet. Though it's hard to see, the power outlets are down there for each table."}
{"text":"Solid fare for an airport eating establishment.  Tacos were tasty, service was solid.  Reason for the 3 star rating was the use of canned beans and parboiled ready rice.  If those two things had been in-house prepared then this would be a 4 star rating.  The bar staff was responsive and friendly.  I would come back."}
{"text":"I really love this place.  I am in this terminal every other week and I have never had a poor experience.  The staff makes this place and are always inviting, friendly and attentive. Breakfast is the best - add an avocado to the huevos rancheros!"}
{"text":"So airports are not my favorite places and the food tends to be overpriced. My husband discovered Blanco when he was on a business trip and loved the quesadillas so much he told me we had to try them the next time we went through the Phoenix airport. Now every time we're in this airport we pray for a decent layover just so we can go have the three cheese quesadillas (all Mexican cheeses) and fresh, very tasty margaritas. The service is insanely fast--we got our food about seven minutes after ordering--and the wait staff is kind and attentive. Everything tastes fresh and the price is definitely not bad, especially for \"airport food\" (heck, I'd want to eat here for a date night...it's definitely not your average airport dive). Blanco is a great respite from the grind and pain that airports can be."}
{"text":"disappointing carnitas burrito. no kick in the dish despite being told it had spices. to compound that, the seating is ridiculous. There are 2 fox restaurants side by side (blanco and modern burger). I ordered from blanco and assumed I would be \"allowed\" to seat in the dining area. As I proceeded to sit this lady comes running and rudely tells me \"you cannot sit here because you did not order a drink\". Mind you I was siting on a crowded high table..... Not at the bar. When I politely old the server that I was waiting for my Food order from blanco, she told me my order was to go (though I never asked for that). this despite there being at least 10 empty spots available. plain rude and terrible attitude. not getting my business ever again"}
{"text":"Locate at TERMINAL A, near Gate 4 and 5 . Great airport food. You know that's a different category, right?  Ok go ahead , don't be afraid to open your wallet.   For Pick Up orders : Don't be cheap, get  a good meal and save buying a drink. Take your canteen/bottle to the water fountain/ water dispenser and fill it up for free. Check my picture.  Across A8 Bon Voyage Viajero. Ciao!"}
{"text":"Needed a quick bite to eat for dinner while on my commute back home to Tampa. Stopped at Blanco's in terminal 4. Greeted with a smile, hostess was nice, waitress was very kind as well.  Ordered the chicken tortilla soup and wow was I surprised. It was so tasty! And it was reasonably priced too at $7. Comes with pico de gallo, sour cream, tortilla crisps, and queso blanco. And it even has a bit of a kick...something that I can definitely appreciate.   Paired it with a Hefeweizen. Perfect."}
{"text":"I have to give props to this place. Originally I sat at the bar and the bartender was so disinterested that I left to find somewhere else. I came back and say in the dining room where I got a nice bloody orange margarita and nachos with a lettuce base instead of chips. Yum!  Service was initially slow but I got checked on and offered help by all the servers on the area."}
{"text":"Decent food for a airport restaurant. They got an extra star for Shauna (cute), but ever so attentive and ensure that I had everything I needed. She's the ideal waitress for any hospitality organization."}
{"text":"For an airport, this was surprisingly really good! Salsa was spicy and had good flavor. Guacamole actually tasted pretty good, although the portion was a bit small. We didn't get enough chips to eat all the salsa, though, and we didn't bother asking if we could get more.   My BF had a Bloody Mary and said it was pretty good. I had a greyhound. It was good, but I've definitely had better.   I had the fish tacos for an entree. It came with 3 street taco sized tacos and a side of rice and beans. I'm not a big rice fan so I hardly ate that, but the black beans were good.   Service was pretty slow at the beginning. It took over 5 minutes for someone to come to our table and ask if we wanted water. We were ready to order at that point. Once we put in the order, our food came out quickly. Normally I would be really irritated with slow service in the beginning, but it's an airport and it was really crowded."}
{"text":"Best Airport Margarita yet,  patron silver and they mix their own sweet and sour mix,  Key just Key.  This is a great Margarita.   So if your ever in PHX and hankering for a good mix of tequila and lime, head on over to A5 next door you will. Find solace in lime juice.    Yum!  Incidentally, I also had the combo fajitas, steak and chicken, both tender and juicy, with great flavor and not too many peppers or onions.  My only criticism would be that they did not have a roster jalapeño on the plate.... But then again I like stupid hot stuff... So.. Your call there.   All in all the best Airport restaurant food I've had in a long time and up there with good/great \"outside\" restaurants.   Giving time I will definitely change terminals to eat here again on my next trip.   Great Job Blanco Taco"}
{"text":"Good food, fast service. Carnitas are so good. Perfect breakfast potatoes. Great start to our trip!"}
{"text":"Long layover in PHX. These guys stay true to the Blanco'a outside if the airport. Kinda upscale Mexican. Cheese Crisp appetizer, chicken fajita for her, grilled shrimp salad for me. A little loud, but good job for the airport."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in the Sky Harbor Airport. I was there in the morning so my review is based on breakfast food.  Service was excelent. I sat at the bar and the bartender was polite and always checking on everyone. Drinks were never left empty and asked about our food.  Menu was small which i thought was a good thing. 4 or 5 different breakfast burrito options and a few traditional south american options. I got the burrito with chorizo. It was good but not great. the eggs were bland but the chorizo was good. the potatoes were really good. Overall i was pleased with my meal.  The drink menu is decent, a few beers on tap and tons of tequila ;-)  I like this spot, and will come back when I'm at Sky Harbor next time."}
{"text":"Understaffed.... &total chaos.   Taco were cold  Everything took forever  The rice and beans are tasty  Who runs this place? --- it is clearly a management problem here."}
{"text":"I love Blanco, just not at the airport. My glass of wine came, no water, no free chips and salsa (btw) and my chicken Caesar salad with took over 30 minutes, had to get it to go!! No apology from the waitress."}
{"text":"Some of the best mexican food I ever had and it was in an airport, imagine that."}
{"text":"A very nice way to eat and spend some time between or before a plane. We found the service and the food above average and better than you would expect from an airport restaurant. We enjoyed the drinks having to go only across the hall the gates. Overall, a very nice place."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best airport food I've had. The Mexican chopped salad and guac were both outstanding. Will definitely stop by during my next Phoenix layover."}
{"text":"Host was asleep on his feet when I approached to get a seat at the bar. That was a good start ... lol Bartenders were attentive and always had a full glass of beer. Started with chips and salsa, laughed when I saw them pouring salsa from a bag. Moved on to grilled fish tacos. Rice was buttery, sweet, milky, and delicious. Black beans were seasoned just right. So close to 5 stars , unfortunately corn taco shells were greasy. For airport food, I would recommend and eat here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I had lunch here while waiting for a flight.  I ordered tacos and my wife ordered the steak salad.  I thought it was ok but not great.  The tacos were a little salty and my wife's salad was not impressive at all.  As far as airport food goes, PHX has upped its game in recent years.  Since there are so many options in the A terminal, I would not recommend this place.  Go to Olive&Ivy or LeGran instead."}
{"text":"Yummy fajitas.   I use fajitas is as a way to know which restaurant is phenomenal. These are some of the best I have ever had.  Super flavorful, served in a small iron skillet with small yummy tortillas. I don't even know how to perfectly describe it. I took a photo but super flavorful. Nothing worse than bland ones. These are tops. The Caramelized onions, peppers and spices were full of flavor.  Jeffrey and Doug are amazing super wonderful and attentive bartenders.   I went to another terminal which had my favorite salad but it was way too packed because there was a large flight going to Europe. I got ignored at the cowboy bar boo hoo. But it was super busy.   I came a couple terminals over and this restaurant is amazing. You wouldn't even know you're stuck in an airport. Fun vibe, great servers (and very attentive) plenty of draft beers and delicious food.   A great way to pass some time while you're waiting for your flight, enjoying a good meal and not feeling like you're stuck just having to burn time."}
{"text":"Food was ok- they sat us quickly and were nice. They told us that the kitchen was closing before we got our food and asked us if we wanted anything else. We weren't sure because we didn't have our food yet. Overall it was ur average airport sit down restaurant experience. Nothing more or less."}
{"text":"Pretty good for an airport restaurant. I had a quick layover and could not consider the thought of another meal on the plane. I stopped in here in a hurry and was seated very quickly. My waitress came to the table in a fair amount of time to take my order. My food was delivered promptly and hot. The food was fairly good. I will probably come back in here when I got in this airport for a layover again."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in awhile because I try to avoid connections through PHX.  While this continues to be a solid place for food, the customer service is not so great.  The tortillas for the tacos continue not to disappoint, and its great they offer tacos for all dietary preferences.  While its always great to see black beans as an option, these taste like pure salt no matter how much hot sauce one adds.  . Only 3 mini tacos for a hefty price.  Nice selection of margaritas, but ignore the menu description of \"no salt\" and be sure to request it.  The server Michael was pleasant and on top of things; however, I managed to get the unpleasant woman working alongside him. Seemed the customer next to me also felt her disdain."}
{"text":"As much as I'd rather be in bed, I Somehow always find myself in the Phx airport in the AM with some time to kill.   This is my go to breakfast stop.  I always order the Steak and Egg Fajitas, I don't think I have ever deviated from this menu item. It is so good. Portion size is far more than I could ever expect or put a dent in. But it still manages to keep me full until nearly dinner.   The small cast iron skillet has deliciously caramelized onions, red peppers and poblanos on the bottom. Topped with sliced marinated steak, very tender and delicious. And if you thought that was the last layer of goodness.....it's not. It's then Topped with egg cooked to your preference, fresh pico, creama and avocado which is an add on but so worth it.    Service and food are both fast, making it easy to get to your flight fat and happy. The waitresses here always have a great attitude and a sense of humor to go along with it."}
{"text":"So so breakfast food. The heuvos rancheros is kinda bland and the breakfast potatoes are very soggy when they're served. Bloody Maria isn't bad though. If you want decent, Mexican breakfast food, this probably isn't your best bet."}
{"text":"Located in Terminal four on the corridor for gates A1-A15, thei Fox concept restaurant is surprisingly like the restaurants on the outside, down to the prices being charged for food and drinks. Service was friendly, including offering recommendations for local beer.   The food left something to be desired. I ordered the pork tacos, with rice and black beans (no choice in beans at this location.) Rice was mushy and not much better than out of a box.  Flour tacos were small, but were hot and good. The pork had little evidence of green chili flavor, and the pico and lettuce did not add much. The meat was moist but just unexciting. I would return, but definitely choose a different menu item. I was not offered chips and salsa."}
{"text":"It's airport food in terminal A 1-14.  I had the steak burrito,  it's fine but I think they put too much of the Pico de Gallo in the burrito which makes it way too tomatoe-y.  The enchilada sauce tasted a little strong,  kinda like it was burnt.  Average food at average airport prices (way too high for what you get - but what are you going to do?)"}
{"text":"First, they had to change the keg. No big deal. Then they said they were out, please order another beverage. Then, after my meal was delivered, they show up with my original beverage order. The Burrito was COLD, the taste was mediocre, the cheese was cold and not melted, and all that for over 15 bucks not including the beverage. Wow, ...I commented that it was cold, colder than my draft beer and the waiter said I'm sorry and walked off.  Never again.   I only gave them a 1 star because the app wouldn't let me submit it with no stars.  I understand they are busy,  but that is what they want. Quality control and customer service is completely absent."}
{"text":"Uh, I completely forgot we were in an airport while dining here!  Delicious! I had some of the best carnitas tacos and my husband's quesadilla was ridiculously tasty.  Service was awesome and quick.  Hell, I look forward to connecting through PHX again in the future!"}
{"text":"For an airport \"food court\" option, it was surprisingly decent. The chips/salsa were good, the chicken Quesadilla appetizer was larger than expected (very filling) and full of flavor, and the unsweetened iced tea was the best I had while in Phoenix....with free refills and they even gave is a large one to-go without any charge. Beats the neck out of Modern Burger which was next door."}
{"text":"What a gem of a find in the Phoenix airport of all places! The huevos rancheros are so good - warm and soft tortillas wrapped in paper and the rest served on a hot skillet, so charming. And wow the taste! The waitress, Jessica, recommended it and she was right on! Next time I'll take her up on her suggestion to add chorizo and avocado. The coffee was also quite good.  Friendly staff, cute ambience, delicious food!"}
{"text":"One of the bigger surprises lately. Good food at an airport with flavor, fresh ingredients and late-ish hours?  Sweet!  Honestly after Yelping I had a couple of other places in mind for our 3 hour layover at Sky Harbor, but once we touched down I was tired, lazy, and not willing to leave my terminal and general gate area.  Blanco it is! The hostess informed us they are serving a limited menu due to the time of night it was, the options were limited to burritos, tacos and quesadillas. I don't get it, because many of the same ingredients go in their other dishes but whatevs. Not my rules.  Guacamole was a must order for me and hub got the salsa. Role reversal happened the minute we sampled these apps, I usually don't care for salsa and thought this one was great, and he usually passes on guac,  but was scooping this one up quite happily so. Both the salsa and guacamole had a hint of spice (roasted poblabos are to thank for that), were very fresh and extremely tasty. No blandness anywhere.  I went with the grilled fish tacos (mahi mahi), 3 all fish - though you can actually mix and match to sample different kinds if you'd like. He went with the carnitas burrito. Both of these dishes are served with a side of black beans (flavorful though slightly salty) and yummy white rice.    The tacos were great, but the burrito is where it's at. Hooooly crap was that burrito good. If nothing else make sure you get the guacamole and the carnitas burrito here - you should not be disappointed.  Yum."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience. I ordered a Mexican salad thinking it would be a safe bet. Not only did it take forever, it looked like it was around forever. It's sad when the people around you state how long it took to get your salad and the the wait staff does not even acknowledge this and then responds by only offering to bring the manager. Very disappointed.  I waited and just mediated for a few minutes and the manager on this own volition came over. He saved the day and was amazing. It's always nice to see professionals in the business of caring!"}
{"text":"We got seated quickly. It was really busy but the environment was clean and warm. However, we were seated quite a while before we were served. I think it may have been a bit disorganized since several people were working the tables around us.  I ordered the chicken fajitas and a Riesling. The wine was super sweet so don't get it if you prefer dry. However the food was amazing...best fajitas I've ever had. We shared the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream for dessert...impeccable."}
{"text":"Extremely rude girl rang me up for a cup of coffee.  She gave me the coffee and then told me I was 171.  I told her I didn't understand what she was talking about and she acted like I was stupid and slowly said ... It's your number to get your food.  I said \"I didn't order any food ... Just coffee which you already gave me.\"  She just turned her back and walked away without saying anything.  With so many choices at the airport,  I'll go somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"I hoped the higher prices than nearby restaurants meant better quality food. The burrito was terrible... Way way way too much cheese. Maybe I was unlucky."}
{"text":"First and foremost, my experience would have not been what is was without the ever so personable, attentive & entertaining service from Tom O. He is who I would want to spend my pre-flight time with! The food--GREAT. I had huevos rancheros and it was stellar!! Tom asked my preferences and recommended a drink he thought I'd like. Turns out it'll by my new fav! Def will be stopping here again anytime I fly through!!"}
{"text":"If I'm diagnosed with diabetes within the next week, I'm pretty sure it's due to my meal at Blanco.    Blanco looks new and chic from the outside with its sexy decor and modern looks.  A gem amongst the fast food chains, this appeared my best airport terminal food option.  Sadly, Burger King or Ronnie would have been far better choices.  I was looking for a safe bet and how can you lose on a chicken burrito ($13) i thought to myself?  I thought wrong.  The burrito was filled with shredded chicken & spices, which looked appealing.  The tortilla was soaked in more grease than any tortilla is meant to absorb.  Soaked to the bone in grease and salt, I took a few bites.  With every bite I took, the salt intake seemed to be exponential, enough to even make me feel nauseous with that much sodium in my stomach.  Seeking relief of the salty chicken grease wrap, I shoveled some black beans and white rice sides into my mouth.  Again, I thought wrong.  The beans were just as damn salty as the chicken.  The white rice let up a little but not by much.  The rice was just as heavily salted, and coated in butter.  Sure, the butter softened the rice and masked a little of the salty taste, but it was not enough of a reprieve from the super massive salt intake.    I was lethargic half way through the meal decided it was best to stop eating anymore right there and stop torturing myself.  I've never felt this sick eating a meal, not even from some of those the MSG laced dishes served up at some Asian restaurants.  I wouldn't recommend the food to my worst enemy, but the beers are reasonably priced for an airport bar, between $5.50 - $8."}
{"text":"Got the chicken burrito and Three cheese quesadilla!!the burrito was great hot and freshly made and so good to taste while quesadilla was ok in taste !!They are probably one of the eat outs open for a longer time at night on terminal 4"}
{"text":"Just had the best service ever by Azalea while waiting for my flight! She suggested me the white sangria which I liked! And she knew all about the vegan options on the menu and helped me pick the perfect meal! My mini tacos were super yummy too!"}
{"text":"The food is OK but I'm really pissed about their limited menu after 9pm.  Some shithead of a manager decided they are only serving Quesadilla's and Burittos tonight.  What the hell?  It's 9pm and there still alot of flights leaving.  Why such a limited menu?  The food here is all based on about 10 ingredients put together in different ways (meat, beans, rice, tortillas, etc).   So why can't I get a taco or a salad?"}
{"text":"Bar actually seems like a fun atmosphere but not does it smell like a dirty mop. So gross!!! Beer selection isn't very big but margaritas look good. Get rid of the smell and its easily 4 star."}
{"text":"So-so food, sky high prices, and staff that just doesn't seem to care."}
{"text":"Great pork burrito wish I could have had guacamole"}
{"text":"Fantastic experience while stopping over in the Phoenix airport.  Husband had the burrito with rice and beans... Very filling and delicious. I had the carne asada tacos with born tortilla shells. Absolutely delicious!  Clean restaurant, prompt and courteous service, and excellent food. We'll certainly return!"}
{"text":"Sitting here right now, service was fast & courteous. Don't order the house margarita unless you like a VERY limey margarita. I ordered tacos with corn tortillas & got flour. I ordered 2 pork tacos & got 1 pork & 1 beef. What???  That being said, the food is good."}
{"text":"Stopped by here while waiting for our flight. Place was pretty busy but got a seat in the bar quite quickly. Started off with drinks and upon them arriving decided not to order food. First they didn't have the wine i ordered so i got a different kind, no big deal. BUT when my red wine was brought to the table it was so gross i couldn't believe the waitress actually brought it over like that. The glass was not only dirty but there was luttle chunks of what looked like limes in the wine. So gross. Got a new glass and it was dirty too. At that point we chose ro go elsewhere"}
{"text":"If you're used to typical airport food this place will happily surprise you. We got the chicken and fish tacos plus the appetizer guacamole. Yum!   Their ice tea is unsweet with a hint of peach - really good. Fantastic and quick service."}
{"text":"Our Waitress, Food, and Drinks were great! Very fast service and our waitress although we forgot her name was very informative and made our layover more bearable. The drinks were expensive, but for airport food and drinks, it was superb and well worth the price. Would definitely come here again during next layover in Phoenix. All 5 of our dishes were good with no complaints."}
{"text":"For an airport, this place had really good Mexican food and friendly fast service. Even the lady next to me commented on how good the food was.  I had the shrimp tacos which came with 3 medium tacos and rice n beans.  Perfect amount. The beer n drinks are good too. (When are they not?)  I will stop by again when passing thru. TIP. At a lot of the tables running along the walls and islands they have outlets at each table. I was able to charge my phone. Sweet, I wasn't a wall hugger."}
{"text":"Not your typical airport food.  We were in a hurry to catch our flight and the host assured us he could have us in and out in 30 minutes or less. OK, great. Didn't expect much for a meal that quick. Boy were we wrong. We ordered our margaritas - and got 'em quick and strong. The food came quick too, and was delicious! Fish Tacos to die for! Everything is made from scratch here and although it can be a little on the spendy side, it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"At Blanco having bacon and beer at 6:39am. This is a great place to start your trip when you have one hour before you fly to Vegas"}
{"text":"Fast and courteous service. Had the carne asada tacos which came with rice and corn and black beans. Tacos were street style on corn tortilla. Very flavorful. Margaritas were delish! Also very reasonably priced. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"Love this place! Had the kids and waiting for our next flight. Oh.. their food was tasty and tons of it! I ordered the quesadilla, HUGE! Fruit bowl , HUGE! took leftovers back and ate the next day. Next stop , needed a drink.. Great service, always happy and happy to help servers, and host were fabulous both times we were there. Food was fast, hot and delicious. Second time we had the steak burrito. Oh my, so yummy and HUGE! took 1/2 to go because it also came with potatoes!! A must go... we will always come back!!! too yummy and fast service, and always had staff to help with anything you need!!!!! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Meh.  The one in Tucson is about 200% better.  Food was only ok.  Service was not good.  Restaurant did not seem clean.  I'd skip it next time and eat elsewhere.  It had that airport lower quality feel."}
{"text":"My expectations of airport restaurants is pretty low, and this one still managed to disappoint.  After seeing how disorganized the hostess station was, we put our names in, the walked further down the terminal hoping to find something else.  No luck, so we went back.  The hostess told us hi-tops still needed to be seated, however then told the next person they were part of the bar and open.   Lots of seating open, yet a line waiting.   Finally we are sat, and over 20 minutes after we order we finally got our food- minus our chips and guacamole.    Chicken was minimal in our salads, and margarita was mediocre- even by airport bar standards.    Overall- just poorly run."}
{"text":"Good breakfast ! I had the burito egg,bacon and cheese. Kind of pricey, but I am at the airport.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Had the mushroom tacos and nachos Blanco.  Really good margaritas, not too sweet, and really strong. Tvs and music. I now love long layovers."}
{"text":"For a $10 airport burrito, Blanco Tacos was pretty damn good! It's about $3 for a bottle of Coke, which is an expected rip off, but you do get what you're paying for as far as the food goes. Sure, it's more expensive than you'd pay at any hole-in-the-wall taqueria, but considering that I've paid $10 for wilted Caesar salads and ham sandwiches at airports, I'd gladly fork over the same dough for a huge carnitas burrito.   You can sit down and have table service at Blanco, but I recommend just stopping by the quick pick-up counter. Burritos are $4 cheaper there, and you'll get your food much faster - hopefully we've all learned by now not to take a gamble on wait staff when our plane is boarding in less than an hour.   For a great dinner at a reasonable price in the A Gates, check out Blanco. I'll be sure to stop by here again in the future."}
{"text":"Ate here while waiting for a plane. Had the grilled fish tacos which were amazing. My kids had the steak tacos and quesadilla. My wife had the ceaser salad which had a bite to it - awesome! For the first time in many years i ate food at an airport and it didnt feel like airport food."}
{"text":"Great customer service and awesome fish and shrimp tacos!  If you have a connection in PHX, this is the place to hang out.  This was built for the traveler.  Relaxed atmosphere and tons of seats to recharge yourself and your electronics."}
{"text":"best chicken quesadilla ever! the service was not fast but the food was definitely outstanding for an airport."}
{"text":"Looking down the row of dining options in Terminal 4, Blanco looked like our best choice. We were able to secure a table immediately and our waitress was quick to take our order. It wasn't a problem that we only wanted to order chips and salsa and to split a burrito.   The chips and salsa came almost immediately and were everything that they should be - homemade, fresh with a nice zippy salsa. The burrito had a generous portion of chicken with a really nice flavor. The rice tasted like it was made with a lot of butter, good or bad depending how much you like butter.   We are used to overpriced and less than delicious airport food so Blanco was an unexpected and delightful surprise."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food.  The carnitas tacos were tasty. Noise level is high but it's the airport crowd, people coming and going. Impressive was how quickly we were seated although they looked like they were full but the hosts surely knew how to push the crowd through.  Service was quick and good, courteous servers and food was delicious!!!  Not a bad venue for an airport restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is really good.  However the service is horrible.  While this is expected at an airport restaruant, this should not be the case since is is a FRC establishment."}
{"text":"This Blanco's location is so nice! You can get a good meal then hop on your plane. I love their pomegranate margaritas and their carne tacos! Even though the tacos are tiny you still leave feeling full. This place is always packed on the weekends so you might have to sit at the bar but its a small price to pay for greatness."}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally get to try Blanco in Sky Harbor. I love Blanco in Scottsdale and what could be better than getting it to go before you fly? The ambience of the 'sit down' area seemed happening. I was in my flight uniform and sitting in a bar is a simple no no. With that, I grabbed a cheese quesadilla from the walk up/to go counter. I will say maybe they are still working the kinks out of a new place, with new people, but it was slow. Getting 'to go' should not ever be slow. Nonetheless, nothing out of the ordinary as far as quesadillas go. Other than they put parmesan cheese on top of the quesadilla and I am not quite sure why? Maybe because the quesadilla was placed in a to go box that was labeled, \"Sauce\"?  Who knows, but that made the entire quesadilla taste overwhelmingly, parma! I did love the salsa .. and I am a salsa snob. It can make or break me on a Mexican restaurant. My friend grabbed the chicken burrito. He seemed to like it but nothing special. Hoping that they will work the kinks out and maybe add a few items to the menu other than just quesadillas and burritos. Like how about some tacos?? Nachos?? Because this airport is my base, I will keep checking back and give them some more tries when in the lower A gates.. BUT won't go out of my high A's where the Blue Burrito is. More selection and tastier."}
{"text":"My first impression of this restaurant was not so great but by the end we left happy. I ordered the nachos and the cheese quesadilla which were a huge disappointment. The nachos were made with gross cheese sauce rather than actual cheese and the quesadilla was just not satisfying. Our waiter asked how the food was and we told the truth and he was so accommodating and switched out our food right away. We got the chicken tortilla soup and it was SO much better! He came back to make sure we were happy this time around. He even removed all of the food from the bill. What Great service!! Great margaritas! Will come back again"}
{"text":"Well I stopped in to watch the hockey game and some baseball on MLB Net. sat down looked over the menu and the bartenders we discussing what they got for tips because one of the bartenders had to leave so they split up there money on her way out she told one of the other bartenders do t spend all of the money in one place. Then may drink order was taken I ordered a skinny margarita I didn't know it came with soda water in it I inquired about it and got the nose up yes that's how it's made. So I ordered something else and I was never offered to take the drink off my bill. During this time the bartenders were again whispering about how the tipping has sucked did it ever occur that it was maybe there attitudes and no customer appreciation? I guess I'm going to be a cheap ass as well at least stop and say hello and engage the customer your not that busy and if you were the tips would be better."}
{"text":"Great airport food.  It was a toss up between this spot and the burger place next door.  I chose right! Had a carnitas burrito to go.  Was a tiny bit dry but solid for an airport.  Came with good salsa and was packed with meat.  They normally have  jalapeños to add but were out today.  That might have made this burrito a 5!"}
{"text":"Had 45 minutes connecting in Phoenix. This place was super quick, I got soft shell chicken tacos which were pretty good and satisfying, good value, but extra points for speedy service!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good tex mex and a great atmosphere. The music is actually really good also."}
{"text":"Update..... this place still kicks ass!  Haha the kick ass part was going to be my updated review, but Yelp says it's too short. So here is some filler!... but all the filler in the world won't take away from my original review and my newly updated review, this place kicks ass. I've always had a great time there. Even when I'm not in that terminal, I try to make it there.  I've always met some cool people."}
{"text":"Whitney's my gal! Sit at the island, plug in your phone and have some yummy braised pork tacos and a cocktail while you wait for you flight!"}
{"text":"Above average airport food, Blanco has some tasty burritos with some upscale ingredients such as braised short ribs.  I really enjoyed the flavors and the value (weighed easily more than a pound), but it can be messy to eat on the go."}
{"text":"Pre-drinks before heading to Mexico. Bloody Marys......ehh......ok. Didn't eat, but the food looked good. Can't say nothing good, can't say nothing bad. It's your average airport bar with an solid C for a staff.  Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible! The salad i had for 15.95 was the worst! I got it to go and this guy Sam F has these restaurants so closely managed for profit the quality is totally gone!  All i can say is they create a buzz to bring people in the restaurant but like most in this chain was another huge disappointment!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across a hint of fortune on our layover in Phoenix. We are two traveling vegans and have found it nearly impossible to find a vegan option at any restaurants in both the airports we have gone through until coming across Blanco. At blanco we noticed there were a few options we thought were vegan and once we decided to get a table we quickly learned that the options we thought were vegan actually were not. Our server, Jill was absolutely phenomenal when helping us find options that would actually cater towards our vegan lifestyles. Although the food was honestly subpar (which what do you expect when dining at an airport) Jill made our experience exceptional. Thank you so much for your hard and honest work. We appreciate all that you did for us Jill and will always remember how nice and helpful you were as we disembark on our adventure to Costa Rica!"}
{"text":"We were very happy to find this little stop in the airport. Grabbed some guac+ chips and a quesadilla. Everything was fresh and tasted great. Wish there we had more time to try the margarita."}
{"text":"I have eaten at many an airport restaurant but don't typically think to review any. But I must share a good experience I just had at breakfast! You'd be surprised how many airport restaurants seem to forget that  their customers are actually trying to catch planes. Not to mention the food is usually \"eh\" (Logan Airport Beer Works, I'm looking at you). Here, though,  our sever consistently checked on us and when I ordered the heuvos rancheros  (which were delicious!)  she made sure I knew those took a little longer to cook (which was not a long time at all really). The service was great,  and the food and bloody Maria were too! If you have some extra time to sit in Terminal 4, do yourself a a favor and come to Blanco!"}
{"text":"If you like tortilla soup with a kick - this'll do it for you ! Great little stop over at the Phoenix airport in the A terminal! Service is friendly and since I had a long layover I was happy not to feel rushed. There were even outlets to charge the computer! Try it!"}
{"text":"Stopped at this bar with a friend between flight and Tina is the BEST bartender! She took excellent care of me and my girl and we had a great time waiting for our connecting flight.   No better bartender than Tina!"}
{"text":"Best nachos in an airport hands down! Also, if you're a wine drinker and you're with someone else, get the carafe of sangria 20 bucks for 4 glasses!! Great service too!!"}
{"text":"At the grand opening Biltmore Fashion Square. The Blanco chopped salad is fantastic. Light citrus dressing and many ingredients. The pulled pork tacos are beyond fabulous Go!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy and the service was slow, but not bad. We ordered the Mahi Mahi tacos.  They were the tiniest tacos we have ever seen. We were told that is what street tacos look like.  Well I grew up in East LA and I lived a few years in Phoenix as well.  These are not street tacos.  They seemed rather defensive about it when we asked.  And for $16, you expect a little more for Mexican food."}
{"text":"I had huevos rancheros and a fruit and yogurt parfait with OJ. Everything was delicious, and much much better than most airport food. The OJ was fresh-squeezed, again not what you find in an airport. Service was fast and friendly. Great place."}
{"text":"After a huge breakfast in San Diego I didn't think I would eat again today but who can resist tacos?!?! Very please with my mahi mahi tacos. The fish was a tad over but the seasoning was perfect and the rice and beans!!! The only negative was the small size of the corn tortillas.  If you are at the Phoenix airport give this place a try."}
{"text":"Had breakfast before my flight, ordered a breakfast burrito. Came with potatoes on the side. Perfect portion, not to big. Was really good, service was good, got me in and out very quickly in time for my flight."}
{"text":"Dear Catastrophe Waitress,  It's not okay to push people out I your way or sneer at your customers.   We can't help it that the airport is busy and that you are poorly managed.  You shouldn't take your anger out on the very people on who you depend for you livelihood.  It's too bad you blew us off.  We are nice people and good tippers.  Happy Thanksgiving."}
{"text":"It was ok, just ok. A little pricey if you make the slightest change to the menu. Salad with shrimp was tasty and fresh but I've had better.   Ok choice."}
{"text":"I'll give them one thing- they're quick. But I ordered the chicken tortilla soup and I am not a fan. There was a huge dollop of sour cream in it, I feel like I'm eating straight sour cream now. It's also extremely salty. I was hoping for a good chicken broth like regular tortilla soup, something light on my stomach. They offered to bring me something else, but I've honestly lost my appetite after a few spoonfuls of that soup. Also, the \"home made lemonade\" tastes like the soda fountain lemonade. Hmmmm. They were kind enough to not charge the soup."}
{"text":"Great steak burrito and they were busy, but FAST! Our server was swamped but was attentive. We had the steak burrito and chips, salsa, and guacamole and all of it was great!"}
{"text":"Great food with great service at a reasonable price. Hey were quick, although the speed wasn't necessary since we had a layover, but would have been nice if we were in a hurry. Hope to come back."}
{"text":"It was quick service & pretty good food! The grapefruit & pomegranate margarita was a little disappointing. We were also all packed in here like sardines, no place to put bags/luggage for a 2 person table. But they had hockey on TV, so can't complain :)"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks.  Airport prices always suck though compared to \"in the city prices\".  I wanna check this place out once I get to Dallas as I heard they have one in Uptown I think.  Nice, casual spot to chill before flight though."}
{"text":"The name of this place is Tacos and Tequila. The restaurant has a to-go window.  Me: I see burritos. Can I order tacos here?  Cashier: No. you have to go around the corner to the bar for tacos. We just have burritos.  *walks to bar, sees crowded line, returns to to-go window and commences burrito order*  Me: No cheese. Is it heavy on rice?  Cashier: I don't know. I've never had a burrito.  Me: So...you've never seen one either?   Cashier: No. do you want extra rice?  Me: No. no rice.  Cashier: $11. Please swipe here.   Clearly three stars is the aim."}
{"text":"Excellent food that came out fast, great service. The chipotle shrimp tacos were delicious!! Our server Jessica was great, fast, and clear on all the offerings. :) Got seats with plugs for laptop and phones!"}
{"text":"I've never been to the Scottsdale location, only this location in the airport. We were seated quickly but I'm honestly not sure who our server was as we were helped by a few different people. The guacamole and chips were both delicious. I ordered the fish tacos - they were very \"fishy\" smelling and really had no flavour.   This was a good spot to stop for an airport meal but I wouldn't recommend the fish tacos."}
{"text":"Nice place, but I was not impressed with the food. I can get more authentic Mexican food at a filibertos. The one shining star was their salsa's, and the service was ok. Not some place I would return to. :("}
{"text":"Let's face it - most airport food sucks. That is not the case at Blanco. It's near gate A5, near the US Airways wing of the Phoenix Airport. I have been here twice now and both time the service and the food has been great.  They have high communal tables in the bar with electrical outlets at each seat. Sweet!  The waitress recommend the braised pork and avocado cheese crisp and it did not disappoint. They service is quick and easy so that you can make your connecting flight and the beer is cold. If you are ever passing through Phoenix and looking for a great Watering Hole - make sure to stop in at Blanco."}
{"text":"I got a burrito. The food was cold so I sent it back. They sent me out another cold burrito. It's more chipotle style than a Mexican restaurant style burrito. Waitress was awesome though. Best I've had anywhere in years. Flavor was good just warm."}
{"text":"Was not expecting much from an airport restaurant ... boy was I surprised. Loved the carnitas burrito (enchilada style). Very generous portions, yummy, and about what I'd expect to pay at any other Mexican restaurant.  We topped off the meal with the flan, which was some of the best we can remember.  Next time we have a layover in PHX, this is where we'll be!"}
{"text":"Where to start. It's airport food, so you always adjust expectations. Initial service was fine, hostess asked if I'd like to charge a phone while I ate, which is a nice touch for an airport restaurant.   After that, everything went south quickly. Poor server, who was probably handling twice as many tables as she should have been, got my order in correctly, but only ever brought half the food out. Other half never showed up, and trying to fix it I finally had to flag down another server because mine was nowhere to be found. Original server finally brought back the check, telling me it was fixed. It was not fixed. Same mistake as before, same challenge trying to get it fixed again, she's a ghost. Finally the other server brings back a check with the correct total that says it's already been closed.  Really? I never signed a credit card slip, so how's that even possible?   It would have been nice to have even one refill during the TWO HOURS I spent there.  Another table nearby waited thirty minutes to get their order in.   They may have some decent food.  I may never know because the chances of me coming back here are just like the cowboys at a Sedona dude ranch - slim."}
{"text":"Single rudest host group I've ever encountered. Food is average airport food... Not worth suffering through the staff."}
{"text":"I have to say this place is hit or miss...the first time I stopped in was GRRREAT!!!! The service was quick fast and friendly.  She got my order right and it really did come out fast.  so if your in between flights great place to stop to eat, drink and watch airport folk:)  I got tacos and a margarita perfect choice before my flight!!  However on the way back it was brunch time and ironically it wasn't that crowed but the waiter was misguided and obviously distracted by something?!??!  I got the Huevos rancheros and it was awesome very tasty...but of course the waiter got the order wrong and it took him half of my dining experiences to bring out my delicious azz spicy bloody mary?!?!?!  Anywho its an airport and this IS the best place in that terminal."}
{"text":"Good carnitas burritos between planes, accompanied by black beans and rice. Guacamole on the side.  It was my first $14 burrito, but it is the airport.  Good service and they didn't push me to leave, so I dawdled over coffee for half an hour.  Next to gate A5."}
{"text":"Ended up here during a 3 hour layover and decided to give them a try. Wow! What a good decision for me! The guacamole was incredible and the quesadilla with chicken was equally yummy! Price was a bit steep for the food but average for airport fare. I will definitely eat here again if I have another layover in this terminal."}
{"text":"Well staffed location at the airport and they hustle but not distracting so. The server I have is doing an excellent job. Tracy is a rock star.   I started with the guacamole and was recommended and definitely worth ordering. The chips came warm mounded in a bowl and accompanied by an excellent salsa. The guacamole and salsa together was a hit.   For the \"main\" course I am trying the 3 cheese quesadilla with Machaca (shredded beef short ribs - nuff said) Oaxaca, Asadero and Manchego cheeses along with fresh pico de gallo. Ah man this beef rocks in a quesadilla. So order this this the next time I am in this airport.   The classic on the rocks margarita with silver Patron and fresh squeezed lime juice is fabulous."}
{"text":"Clean, very good service, delicious food, fair price, casual ambiance. I like it!  Didn't see any bad point."}
{"text":"Great carne asada tacos!! Wine selection is nice as well. Outlets available, lots of single seats :)"}
{"text":"tacos are pretty good. draft beer selection is small service is so-so"}
{"text":"To ways to order sit or order to go at their grab and go area. Breakfast, lunch and dinner. Mexican plates the way you like them reasonable prices ($8-$14). I was in a hurry purchased a bloody Mary at the bar and swigged it down ...not bad for under $7. Located between gates A4 and A5 ... American airlines."}
{"text":"Let me tell you about my favorite new Mexican restaurant. They serve these amazing three cheese quesadillas that you can inhale in six minutes flat, with a beer, while you are rushing to catch your connecting flight at Phoenix Sky Harbor airport.   And they also have this amazing free laptop shipping service for the patrons who leave their corporate laptops at the bar. Amazing food and shipping services. Thank you - to the unnamed bartender, Lauren, and Courtney from Blanco Tacos and Tequila."}
{"text":"Hands down the best nachos I've ever had. It was not typical nachos but more like craft version.. we tried with pulled pork and was v good."}
{"text":"One of the best airport burritos I have had.  It was quick and tasty (everything you might want from airport food).  I definitely will stop by next time I am passing through."}
{"text":"This place USED to be a 5 star place, easy... Not so much anymore.. The last few times that I went, the quality of the food as well as the service has gone downhill a LOT! Ordering the food took forever.. Then it took forever to GET our food (AND our drinks came out AFTER we got our food - we were unable to track anyone down or get anyone's attention). Then I don't think that our waitress came to our table (a food runner dropped the food off) to see how everything was or if we needed anything else (including water refills or extra drinks). We were in a bit of a rush to catch a flight, as well... this used to be our go to spot in the airport, but we will be skipping it from now on. It definitely isn't the same place that it used to be."}
{"text":"Had one of the best tortilla soups ever there. Very surprising (in a good way) for an airport restaurant. Lots of flavor. Some heat, but not too much. Good size bowl. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Wow! Sky Harbor has sure upgraded the food selection. I just had one of the best Chorizo, Egg and Cheese Breakfast Burrito's I have had in a long time. I got it from the to go window and it was fast and stuffed full with plenty of Chorizo, which typically gets skimped."}
{"text":"No matter from which gate we're traveling, if we're leaving in the morning, we're grabbing breakfast burritos from Blanco T & T. They're fast, flavorful, and filling - just what you want when you're traveling across the country. And the salsa is sooooo yummy - definitely ask for extras!"}
{"text":"So coming in about 2 hours before my flight, decided to stick somewhere that was close to my gate. Walked up to the hostess and said I was only drinking if there was a spot. So I got sat at a high top, crammed between two people. The waiters name is Richard and seemed eager in the beginning. Ordered a drink and it came right out. Then didnt check on me or the people around me for 30min. Over the two hours being here, I only got two beers. I dont know if its worth to stop by here because of the slow service. We are in an airport. Food/Liquor should be served quicker or people will miss their flights. Honestly they have more people dressed to work then are actually working. It took me another 20 minutes to get my check. 2 drinks + a check in 2 hours. Somethings not right."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had at the airport!!!  No kidding. Best service, great coffee, atmosphere, and gourmet food delivered in sit down place within minutes of my order. Had heuvos rancheros with machaca. Fantastic food and they are doing it right."}
{"text":"Amazing. Just as great as my frequent trips to their main restaurants minus my jalapeño margarita (not served in their airport location)."}
{"text":"Wow can't believe this is an airport restaurant. Quick and friendly service. Braised green chili pork tacos were delicious and the salsa topping was so fresh. Large margarita is just what I needed before my red eye flight back to Tampa. If I lived in Phoenix I would be a regular."}
{"text":"There's not much you can really say about airport food. \"Good\" airport food is still okay food comparatively to outside restaurants. Blanco had really good and fast service, so that was a plus. The seating is very tight if you sit in the two people tables, so there isn't much room if you each have a carry-on suitcase with you. This location was convenient since it was right next to my terminal, so that's why I ate here. Food was okay!"}
{"text":"Was told it was must try place when landing in PHX! Even with the awkward moment of the bartender looking at me and then my ID for like 5 min making sure it was me when ordering their Bloody Mary's which by the way was so good I ordered 3 must say I'm glad I stopped by! Awesome drinks food and service!! If I'm ever in PHX will make sure to stop again!"}
{"text":"This is my second time having Blanco's and it's pretty good. It has delicious burritos that are reasonably priced ($10) and they get you your burritos fast. I would have given them five stars but when I had a burrito from them a few years ago, the flavor was much better! The burrito had more of a kick to it which I like! This one was more mild. The first time I went there, I believe I had a chicken burrito which had a nice kick to it and this time I had a chicken burrito again which was good but didn't have that POW!! that I had the first time and was a little salty. Otherwise, it was very filling and pretty good! A great place to get fast service food that is fresh, delicious, and easy to eat especially when you are on a layover and need to hop onto your next flight! I do recommend Blanco! :)"}
{"text":"Management contacted me and offered a refund plus a complimentary meal. Very classy!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Blanco did not disappoint. We ended up being about an hour early for our flight and decided to come in for a bite instead of doing our usual grab and go airport dinner routine. Surprised to see a full service Mexican joint in the airport that has upscale and current Mexican options, we had to try it!  I'll get to the point - this was great. Margaritas were tart and fresh. Not too sweet, not too strong, well balanced and tasty. I wish they used a courser salt on the rim but that's nit picky.   The tacos were full of flavor and the perfect amount of food. Fresh, warm flour tortillas and the carne asada were amazing. The others with me got salads and were singing their praises for the whole flight afterwards.   If you have time - come here!"}
{"text":"Walked in and was greeted by MONIQUE, with a smiling face and seated us quickly at a high top. The table was dirty and the 2 girls next to us weren't happy with their service. We asked for someone to wipe off the table which was excited promptly. We still have not been served by a server. Then, Jered, scowled at us and rudely commented that we, \"get your bag out of the walk way! It's a danger to public!\" No excuse me ma'am. No hey this Is a hazard to our server can you please move your bag. We mentioned that he was rude and it was uncalled for and he scoffed at us and shrugged his shoulders with a whatever remark! I get it! You rotate customers and never see them again. I am a Manager at a very Corporate restaurant in California. If my servers did this I would have them suspended until further training! Tye, the Manager, was sweet and tried to resolve the issue. But, even with that I will ensure that none of our clients or my restaurant friends return to your establishment! The two stars was for Tye and Monique. I will be sure to spread the word about the service here!"}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast burrito from on the go window  Friendly service Burrito was decent.  12\" flour tortilla with eggs, bacon and cheese with a small dash of pico de Gallo."}
{"text":"Its a popular Texmex option in the PHX airport.. got seated in 10min. Service was fine, but space felt crowded.  Ordered: - beef tacos : are oh so bite sized ! Taste great though.  - chicken quesadilla : was huge portion, about half of a large pizza. Cheesy and yummy and comes with simple sides.  - oaxacan shandy : Tecante Mexican beer plus pineapple soda was delicious and was sufficient to get me started towards my happy place.  Overall I'm glad we made the most of our flight delay by eating here."}
{"text":"I dread eating at the airport. Everything is super expensive, very microwave-y and just gross. Blanco was a pleasant surprise! I came in for breakfast around 8am and it was already pretty packed.   The menu was short but had a variety of options. The prices were $8-$14 for options from short ribs, to chorizo burrito to huevos rancheros. Since I was in AZ I had to have the chorizo burrito that came with well seasoned potatoes. I couldn't finish the whole thing and at $9, this is a great option even  without being in an airport!   They also have an extensive drink menu, specifically with tons of tequila options. It was a little too early for that but I definitely would get into trouble here.   My food was ready quick even though almost every table was occupied. I definitely will be back when I fly out of PHX!"}
{"text":"Sitting at the bar for 30 minutes without being asked if I wanted to order food.  Bartenders bustle around and avoid eye contact with customers, focusing on closing duties even though closing time is an hour away.  Pretty pathetic for a hungry traveler between flights."}
{"text":"Worse than its non-airport location but better than some of the competition in the airport including Matt's Big Breakfast and Cowboy Ciao."}
{"text":"Every time my wife and I have a layover in Phoenix, we try to make it by Taco Blanco. Our favorite is the three-cheese quesadilla. If you are in a hurry, just get it to go, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Grate service, the guys at the door very humble gave us everything we needed they were on top of the Job. I'm pleased by everyone here. Anthony was amazing maryam was very nice and on top of her Job...diff coming back"}
{"text":"Quick, efficient, and good food before you fly! I'm a big fan of Mexican style breakfast, so I wanted to try Blanco before boarding my flight to CLT. I was quickly seated and given menus, and drink orders were immediately taken. For breakfast, they have a variety of breakfast burritos and other breakfast specials. I got the Macha and Eggs (braised short rib) and my boyfriend got the huevos rancheros. The food came out quickly, which was appreciated being at the airport. The Macha and Eggs were good, the only complaint is that it wasn't really mixed together so you either got a bite of the short rib or the eggs. I ended up just eating it out the burrito with the homemade salsa so I was happy. The huevos rancheros looked incredible, in a skillet, and my boyfriend was pleased. Quickly got the check and we were on our way! Overall, a good pick if you like Mexican and need a bite to eat before your flight."}
{"text":"Pulled pork tacos very good. Beer selection OK but could be better. Bartender was crabby b&&&& . Poor service, attitude issue. Long time to get check. Sooo food good but sit at a table not bar"}
{"text":"This place is fucking trash the waitress serving the drinks were rude she ignored me when i asked if the restaurant served tacos and i definitely won't be coming back here sorry they have lost a good customer. She said my food would be ready within 15 minutes. I went to my flight to check and see if they were leaving me and I came back she had an attitude saying that \"she sent my tacos back \" Because I wasn't there . I never even paid for the tacos yet, so I asked her if she could make another order for me she got an attitude and went to the back of the restaurant and got the old order and try to bring it to me and I told her that she needed to make a new batch because that's been sitting there for a minute she started to get an attitude and then went back there with the cook and he came back with the old order and said you sure your gonna be here for this order and rolled his eyes and  threw the food in the trash very hostile and violently. There was also another customer at the restaurant who agreed that she way being very rude and the thing with the cook was unnecessary."}
{"text":"Had Mexican all up and down the coast of CA. This place still had the best carnitas burritos of our trip. Ridiculous amounts of meat and quality ingredients. Super filling, plus rolled so well, no stuff fell out. Had to get it flying out, and flying back. You go Blanco."}
{"text":"Just had a short rib burrito at the phoenix airport and it was incredible. I wasn't even that hungry.  Their tortillas make it- kind of sweet. Def a unique flavor. Ingrediants were very fresh."}
{"text":"Good burrito. Really bad margarita and bartender was actually kind of unfriendly. I requested a strawberry margarita and she made me a plain one without a pause. She barely made eye contact and seemed unhappy to be here."}
{"text":"I ate at Blanco while flying through Phoenix airport.  I did take out, but they also habe nice bar area (which was packed).  I had the chicken burrito which came with rice, beans, onions, and peppers.  The tortilla was very nice, it tasted kind of fresh.  I liked the chicken.  It could have used more of the vegetables.  I also wish that it had come with guacamole.  It was good overall, better than I expected.  Service was pretty quick.  They also have Yelp special with tequila I might try next time."}
{"text":"Blanco Tacos and Tequila is the worst of the worst of airport restaurants/bars. The only redeeming quality is that the staff was nice and did not screw up the order.  For 14 dollars I had Tamale Chicken plate and a bottled water. In the Styrofoam tray it was nothing but a siring hot, melted cheese pile with disgusting chicken and over cooked rice. The equivalent to a school meal at 3 times the price. I would not suggest eating here for the horrible food."}
{"text":"So good. Lots of meatless options, amazing rice, awesome margaritas (BLOOD ORANGE!)... and a really fun environment. I make it a point to get there whenever I'm in town for Spring Training."}
{"text":"I'm stingy with my stars, but this place deserves a four, simply because it's the best damn food I've had in an airport. And if it weren't in an airport I'd still eat here.  Solid drinks, nice atmosphere, friendly service, flavorful, spicy and dishes are presented very nicely.  Apparently the owner owns all three spots here, including Modern Burger and Olive & Vine."}
{"text":"My son and I split the Chicken Fajitas. Instead of all the ingredients coming separately on an iron platter, they came all mixed together in an iron skillet. The grilled chicken strips were in a stew of cooked red peppers and onions with pico de gallo, shredded cheddar and sour cream on top. Nothing wrong with this, unless you are my son and don't want your grilled chicken mixed in with these things. Despite the mismatched expectations, it was a good dish. The fajitas came with delicious black beans and a bright-tasting corn and rice mix.   We also had the Mexican Chopped salad. My wife and I both thought it was delicious, but there was more salad dressing than necessary. My daughter thought it was too spicy."}
{"text":"Had a layover in Phoenix and it was still early.   Needed a quick bite so I stopped at Blanco.  Had an egg, cheese and bacon burrito.  It was one of the best I have ever had.   It almost melted in your mouth.  What ever they are doing, please continue.   I wish that I was there around lunch time because I want to try another burrito.     Can't wait for my next layover in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is nice, clean, friendly and quick. However, the tacos are very bland, especially if you're used to authentic Mexican tacos. They are also incredibly small. You'll get three bites out of each taco. But the chips, salsa and guacamole were pretty good."}
{"text":"Great airport restaurant for a quick bite. Had the chips + salsa and the Mexican Chopped Salad with chicken. All very tasty! Every interaction I had with staff were friendly -from the host to the server and food runner. My server was very nice and helpful with recommendations. Plan to come here again the next time I'm in Terminal 4!"}
{"text":"I ordered a bacon, egg, with cheese burrito to go. The turnaround time was about 2 minutes. When the guy handed me the bag I thought there was an error cause it was so heavy. Turns out that $9 burrito is a beast. I wouldn't be surprised if they told me it took a half dozen eggs to make it. The tortilla was fresh, the eggs were fluffy, but the bacon was just a tiny bit too hard. It was loaded with Pico de Gallo which I wasn't expecting, but it did add a nice dimension to the flavor. $9 is a bit steep even for airport prices, but my appetite is more than satisfied."}
{"text":"Sometimes life throws you lemons in the form of flight delays. Blanco is a perfect place to make lemonade with it, preferably with vodka!  Located in Terminal 4 of the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, it's on the A gates end of the terminal. Which makes it about a 10-minute trek (faster if you run on the walkalators) from the D gates where we arrived. Even faster if you manage to catch a ride with a skycap (totally worth the experience on its own). If you have a longer layover, do not settle for less!  This place hits all the hallmarks of a good airport restaurant - quick to seat, serve, and get you on your way. In addition, their prices are *extremely* reasonable for an airport restaurant and the food is absolutely delicious!  Absolutely try the carnitas. Among the best I've had, it was moist and very flavorful. I'm not a huge fan of flour tortillas, so I ordered a no-tortilla buritto, expecting it to come out in little piles of ingredients on a plate. The kitchen must've read my mind, though, because it came out as a buritto bowl - the stuff of my naked burrito dreams! The rice was al dente and rich, loaded with butter, I believe. Black beans were tender and well-seasoned. Topped with pico de gallo and a light sprinkling of cojita cheese. Everything in my bowl just worked and I was a happy happy camper. They make a rocking guacamole with roasted poblanos and a really zippy red salsa, served with freshly fried tortilla chips. All this with a lovely Barrio Brewing Co. Tuscon Blonde draft. You won't need that in-flight bag o' pretzels and complimentary beverage.  There are power outlets at the tables and high tops, so you can charge up more than your tummy before your flight. It was busy the whole time we were there but they didn't rush us at all. Can't wait to be stranded at PHX again :)"}
{"text":"The Mexican Chopped Salad is truly one of the BEST salads I've ever had! It was so good! Also the last time I was here the waiter got sour cream or something in my brand new 400.00 Coach purse. I didn't see it and never would have known but he stepped up and told me what happened and we cleaned it up bad it never touched the purse. If it wasn't for his honesty my purse wound have a big stain. I've never splurged on a purse before so I would have been pretty bummed. I so appreciated his honesty! Anyway, this is a great place to eat!"}
{"text":"When traveling through PHX I have eaten at Blanco several times. The Mexican Chopped Salad is my favorite. I prefer the lime cilantro vinaigrette over the ranch. It comes piled high with lettuce, black beans, corn, crunchy tortilla strips, scoop of sour cream and guacamole (chicken or steak optional) This trip I ordered chips and salsa, the salad with vinaigrette, no chicken or steak. Salad was a little heavy on the dressing but it was a busy lunch time and I was cutting it close on time so I didn't say anything. When my check came it appears that I was charged for chicken? My $8.75 Salad turned into a $12 Salad... and the only thing I can think of was that meat was accident added to the bill not the Salad. After sitting there for 15-20 minutes waiting for the waitress to come back and risking missing my flight, I took the check to the waitress, paid and ran to my gate, like one of those crazy people in the airport. I was not able to have the bill corrected and now wonder if I've been paying extra on past bills? Hopefully this was just a one time oops.... hate to have it happen to other diners.  Update - The manager reached out to me. We had a great discussion. I really appreciate the concern. Anyone that takes the time and effort to hear out the consumer and make improvements is a wonderful manager. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"They were out of white peach/hibiscus margi :( We got the key lime margi per the waiters suggestion. It was fantastic! I got the Eggs & Bacon burrito... Nothing short of amazing. Friends got huevos rancheros and they loved it! Best airport food I've ever had, hands down!"}
{"text":"3 stars for food. Guac is tasty. Had roasted veggie crips. That was good as well. Would have rated it 4 stars...but the waitress Anda spoiled the experience. Forgot our plate settings, the chips and forgot our table as well. She is too uptight for traveling airport folks!!!y"}
{"text":"Just an awesome place To eat.... At the airport no less! I had a layover that lasted longer than expected on my way to Northern California and dropped into this place for a quick bite. Great selection of Mexican food and drinks. I had the short rib and avocado cheese crisp (Mexican pizza) and it was just decadently good!"}
{"text":"Update: Mike contacted me promptly and apologized that our experience was less than excellent, and offered to make it up for us. I am updating my rating to what it would be otherwise. Original one star review below.  The food and service was great until the moment when the waiter started an argument over charging us for a drink we didn't order.  He made a scene big enough to get some loud mouth next table making some clueless comments insulting me and my wife.  Mexico dive bar experience without even leaving the airport, anyone? Just an accident I suppose.  The misunderstanding over the bill was resolved by the manager quickly, but what a way to ruin what would have been otherwise a good experience and spoil a great vacation."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and the bartender was on it.  Got me a margarita and chips & salsa.  Chips & salsa were real good.  Chips were crispy and salsa had some zip to it.  Margarita was decent.  Didn't knock my socks off but didn't have the gross fake lime juice.  Can't do that sugary garbage...  Ordered the chipotle shrimp tacos to which the bartender gave his stamp of approval.  They were great.  Added a little chulula to each for a little extra zing.   The rice had some lime, corn and cilantro in it.  So good.  Good meal in between flights, so for that Five Stars!"}
{"text":"Omg!! The best food I have ever had!! If you are at this restaurant or near bye Eat this amazing food. Thank you for stuffing my belly with the best food ever!"}
{"text":"Too much jalapeño on my burrito ... they charge for sourcream and pico de Gallo ... just an FYI. My server had to be in something she get twitching and forgetting our drinks and once our order.. lol the only reason I give this place 4 stars is because the food was so darn delicious for the value."}
{"text":"Food is great, but service was horrible!  We were ignored for at least 12 minutes and the person I talked to about service was rude.  We ordered chicken tacos, cheese quesadilla, chicken taquitos and margaritas.  Almost all of the food was delicious, and it was all fresh.  If the service was better and the prices were lower, I would give them 5 stars.    Chicken Tacos - AMAZING.  Not only the tacos themselves, but the side of rice too (which I swear is coated in butter, but I don't care).  Chicken was well-seasoned and delicious.  $14 is a little steep though.  Cheese Quesadilla - Good and cheesy, but something about it was almost sweet.  Taquitos- The edible parts in the middle were good, but the outsides were fried too long and couldn't be eaten because the chicken inside turned hard-as-a-rock.  Margaritas were good, but $10 for a soda sized glass of margarita is ridiculous.  If I'm in the Phoenix airport again, I would definitely come back for the chicken tacos!"}
{"text":"The run down above average Mexican-inspired food priced above average. Taco platters are 3 mini tacos with a scoop of rice and beans. However, I will say, I got the braised pork tacos and they were quite delicious despite their size. Service was just about adequate; servers didn't seem to enjoy working or do anything past bare minimum to prevent managers from yelling at them. Seating was comfortable and there was charging stations."}
{"text":"Delicious egg and cheese breakfast burrito!   It's not often I'm inspired to write a Yelp! review, but this burrito was so good I just had to.    I wasn't expecting anything amazing because it was fast, airport food but I wasn't pleasantly surprised. The tortilla was soft and chewy, it had just the right amount of cheese, and the salsa was surprisingly spicy! The perfect little quick breakfast as I dashed to my gate."}
{"text":"This place is bullshit. I ordered a cheese quesadilla and after 15 minutes asked the status of my order. The cashier turned and spoke to the cook, then told me \"she's making it right now.\" Ten minutes later my order was ready, I asked if I could have some chips and the woman told me it would be another dollar. The quesadilla sucked, they forgot my order, and it was 12$ for a tortilla with cheese. I think I'll go to Taco Bell next time."}
{"text":"The food and my server were exceptional!! I had the short rib and avocado cheese crisp and it was divine. However, the policies of the place make me confused. They have a to go window right next door, but if you get food there, you are NOT PERMITTED to sit in the dining area, even if it's totally, utterly, and completely empty. \"Customers\" are directed to the open seating area of Olive and Ivy, which is 2 stores away. Here's an idea!! Maybe the people selling the to go food could actually TELL the \"customers\" the \"rules\" so they don't just wander over, sit down, and  then get told they can't sit there - even though they are paying customers and there is tons of open seating. Makes zero sense.   In addition, the host LITERALLY stared at the rear end of EVERY. SINGLE. FEMALE. he seated who was wearing yoga or exercise pants. Honestly. It was gross."}
{"text":"In my experiences, airport food is never great &always overpriced, but I was very impressed with Blanco in Terminal 4. We stopped in to get carne asada breakfast burritos & I was not disappointed. Also, the bloody mary was delicious. The only downside is the price, but that's airport food for you!"}
{"text":"Bad experience here. Food was wayyyy over salted. Couldn't finish it. I had the Carnita and Chicken Burrito."}
{"text":"What can I say about Blancos other than delicious? The food is always exceptional and it is a destination restaurant whenever I'm in Phoenix. The cheese crisps are terrific. The alcohol is terrific. The service is great. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Five stars for service at the bar, 0 stars for the food.   Salt, salt, and more salt.  And to think I thought I have a high salt tolerance.     Bar is great if you just want to grab a brew!"}
{"text":"To summarize up front for those just looking for the nitty gritty: - Speed of service:  5 stars - Employee attitude:  4 stars - Food:  4 stars - Value:  3 stars  I typically time my trips so that I arrive at the airport, cruise through TSA, and get to my gate within just a few minutes of boarding.  But this time I actually arrived at PHX early enough to grab a bite to eat at Blanco.   Admittedly, this has happened a few times in the past and the airport Blanco is a great spot for a breakfast bite and even bloody (for those so inclined).    I had about 40 minutes to spare and ordered the huevos rancheros.  The dish was prepared expediently and delivered, giving me ample time to enjoy while reading the news before heading to my gate.  Honestly, it was delicious and a little more than I needed in the morning.     Of course, airport meals are always expensive, but this was a decent value as far as airport meals go."}
{"text":"Good food (and great portions - not mountains of food), good service, good prices. At an airport! I had the roasted mushroom tacos with corn tortillas and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Pretty nice for an airport bar. Just had a bloody mary, but the food looked good."}
{"text":"At the airport and we still had a couple hours to kill before our flight, thought I'd try Blanco Taco and Tequila and see if they're different than their main restaurant in Phoenix. They delivered... service was on point, speed (which is critical in an airport location) was amazing and food tasted delicious.   Had a pint of kilt lifter and Mom had a corona, we ordered the three cusses  quesadilla and a plate of tacos (chicken, bbq shrimp and carne asada) and all tasted good.   If I'm at terminal 4 again I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"5 stars for quick seating during the lunch hour and tasty Mexican food!  I had about a 2 hour layover in the airport and we decided to get a bite to eat before heading back home on a long flight. We found this place in passing and decided it looked pretty good. We specifically wanted a sit-down restaurant to relax as well, and this was the place!  I ordered a nachos and my husband ordered the steak tacos. The nachos were da bomb with warm chips, white queso, salsa and all the fixings. It was way more than I expected for a restaurant in the airport. The service was excellent as well, as when were half-way through the meal I asked for our check because we had to reach our gate in time. The waitress also asked if we needed a cookie or snack for the plane...I thought how kind.  I'd love to go back and actually try the tequila next time :)"}
{"text":"3 stars for the seating/how busy it is really.  I came here over the weekend, waiting for my flight to board to head back to California.  I got here around 9:00AM with my boyfriend and we went to go find where our gate was to board.  We surveyed the area and found somewhere (close) to eat.  It was between this place or another place that served strictly just alcoholic drinks (it's 5:00 somewhere, right? haha!)  So we chose this place, it was pretty crowded but it was only thw two of us so it wasn't that bad.  We were immediately seated  and our server came to our table within seconds.  The seating arrangement was different, maybe because it was a small place but we basically had a chance to choose where we would like to sit.. and we also shared tables with strangers.  My boyfriend got himself a beer, I forgot what it was called but it was a nice amber color.  I got a mixed drink called the Greyhound.  Mine was tasty, but probably not my favorite (I don't like vodka).. it had grapefruit juice so I enjoyed that part at least.  We ordered a steak and egg burrito, which we had to split because our appetites was not big.  Around this tiny restaurant, we had tv all around us to watch.  Fortunately, we are huge sports fans so we enjoyed what was on tv!  Our steak and egg burrito came on two separate plates (instead of bringing an extra empty plate) they already split it for us, which was really nice.  The burrito sizes were pretty good!  Think of a Big Mac burger size.  They also come with a pico de gallo salsa, and home fried potatoes.  The potatoes were a little orange, and because of that I thought they were sweet potato fries.  They weren't, but I'm ok with that.  Overall, the food was pretty good and the service was as good as the food.  A few things I did not like though was the size of the actual place, and because of that... workers with food trays, carts, etc. would have a hard time passing though the restaurant.  I would come here again if I had to leave from the Phoenix Airport and probably order the Huevos Rancheros"}
{"text":"One of the best airport restaurant/bars I have been to. Always fair priced drinks and wine and very good quality food. Service was outstanding at the bar tonight.  Thanks Doug! This is my go to place when stuck in PHX for a few hours."}
{"text":"We went to the to-go counter to the right of the restaurant, and ate at the gate to keep things frugal (not having to tip). My chicken burrito was huge and really good- and a few steps up from chipotle in terms of complexity of flavor (and I'm a big chipotle fan, just to be clear). The price was decent ($9) considering its airport food. I'll come again!"}
{"text":"By far the absolute worst bar staff I have ever encountered took 20 minutes to order two drinks took another 45 minutes to pay for those two drinks of all the restaurants in the airport I will never stop at this one again"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Sat at the bar... Staff are super friendly and on it! Never had a dry cup and my food was out in no time! Not to mention the food was delicious... Had the Machaca Nachos! Yummy and definitely plenty to eat! This will be my go-to when I fly through!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Decided to forgo breakfast at the hotel and test my luck at the airport. I wanted to be able to sit down and be served - versus a McDonald's!  Really cute atmosphere- hip and the music is lively. Great service from Christina! The food was excellent. I had the bacon egg and Mexican cheese burrito. It is a large portion and served with a side of potatoes. The fresh salsa is what really ties it all together. Now I just need to be located on a Mexican beach somewhere!  Will definitely come here again when I travel through PHX."}
{"text":"Cute place with good Mexican food and great service. Cool atmosphere and friendly staff! Jil Bush the hostess was really nice and attentive. Will come back next time I'm in Terminal 4. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing to eat at especially at the airport. The service was great, my waiter kept checking to see if I needed a drink refill or order more food. They're not pushy to have you leave and the setting is quite comfortable. The food was yummy and flavorful!! If you're looking for something filling and delicious while waiting for your flight, I definitely recommend going here!"}
{"text":"Stopped by in the morning and had a breakfast burrito. Chorizo and cheese. It was teddy and surprisingly enough, in great quantity. Line moved gay, and was delivered the burrito in minutes and made my tight connection. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ate breakfast here when we got bumped to a morning flight. Breakfast burritos are $9-10 each. They were pretty good sized but mostly egg and tortilla. Very VERY skimpy on the meat. The pico de gallo was fresh though, and a little spicy. Also came with a little cup of salsa that was ok. A couple of negatives...they wouldn't allow us to substitute potatoes instead of eggs for some reason, and because of the way the burrito was put together, the cheese was on top of the pico de gallo and didn't melt at all. At the end, I ended up just eating the bacon and pico de gallo out of it and throwing away a big chunk of the egg and tortilla. Not worth the price. You can get a breakfast burrito in So Cal that is ten times better for half the price."}
{"text":"I went to this airport restaurant on recommendation from another traveler who frequents the area.  I am always weary of airport restaurants as many of them prey on the 'captive audience' aspect of air travel.  However, this place truly was a treat.  As per usual, I asked the waiter what he recommended and ordered the fish tacos in corn tortillas.  I should mention that the waiter was knowledgeable and understood both the description and taste of every item on the menu.  That, alone, is a huge plus.  When I got the fish tacos, the presentation was colorful and fish was fried very well.  Many fish tacos I have received have fish which appears to be fried whole then chopped.  This fish appeared to be cut then fried which meant each little fish nugget held together very well (if you didn't do this, then great job getting the fish not to completely fall apparent in the taco).  All the components in the taco were well balanced, individually seasoned, and distinct (i.e., it didn't just taste like generic 'fishy meat' in a wrapper).  I don't know when I will be in the area again, but if I have another layover in Phoenix I will be sure to hit up this spot."}
{"text":"I wasn't all that hungry when I walked by Blanco around 11am, but was intrigued enough by the option of a machaca burrito that I decided to give it a go. Machaca, as I typically have it, is a beef cooked in its delicious juices until it's plenty succulent. This didn't taste like any machaca I had had before, it had almost a chocolatey flavor to it. Not what I was expecting but not bad either. The cheese in the burrito added to the richness.  I'd gladly come back here again"}
{"text":"Had the Mexican Chopped Salad but I added shrimp and changed the dressing to Cilantro Lime.  YUM!!!  I would post a pic of my super clean plate, but naaaah!  Good food.  Decent price, especially for an airport!  Now to find something to do for another hour and a half before my plane leaves"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a Bloody Mary and lunch. I ordered the nachos with menchaca short ribs. They were some of the best nachos I have had in a long time. I am pretty picky about nachos because they are usually drenched in queso. This place uses a white queso, and the right amount so the chips stay crispy. It is delicious and reasonably priced. If I was doing a blind taste test, I would not guess that this is airport food. So good! I highly recommend stopping in for some nachos and a Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"Needed a place to sit and chill and eat and have drinks between flights without being rushed.  Walked around the terminals till I found this place.  Looked busy, but they found me a table.  I ordered a pomegranate margarita, chips and guac and 3 carne asadas.    I had 3 different servers take care of me and check on me for the 2 hours I hung out there.  Great service, great food, was happy to find this place."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that when I walked up to be seated I should have turned around then. I am in no way saying this place is bad. It is not, but it is not my kind of place. I look for a place with the \"Cheers\" vibe. Friendly, easy going, laid back, & fun. This is more of a here to be seen place. True food was good. Everyone is super nice and if your into this kind of place it would probably be a 5 star for you."}
{"text":"Like most, I'm prepared for mediocre food in airports.  This place is not.  The food was really very good, the portions hefty, and there are outlets to plug in a laptop all around the outside to boot.  I had the guacamole (made in house, not shipped in) and it was great.  It's often hard to get good guac at restaurants that aren't in airports, so I think that says a lot about this place.  I also had the tortilla soup, which had lots of shredded chicken, was a large size, and was very flavorful.  I will be heading to this place every time I go through PHX from now on."}
{"text":"I started off with every intention of a good review about this place, because the food was amazing and because I love to give props to local joints popping up in Sky Harbor.   I had the carnitas burrito minus the pico de gallo (ew tomatoes) and it was phenomenal. The perfect size. The perfect combination and proportion of ingredients. Carnitas that made me want to marry it.   There was a long wait for tables so I ordered my food to go. I put my name in as well but had already eaten because I was starving. I sat at a table ready to crank out some work while waiting for a flight.   Getting into a table with a carry on and a laptop bag is nearly impossible. I don't know why restaurants in airports continue to do this. This is a new restaurant. I really wish they had gotten it right.  When my server arrived, I notified him that I had ordered no more than 20 minutes ago, but that tables weren't available at the time, and that since I was already finished, I'd just like a glass of water.   After 5 minutes he came back with my water and informed me in a very condescending manner that when the wait for tables filled up again, he would have to ask me to leave, because even though I ate while tables were not available,  I was not considered a paying customer.    This is where the stars dropped to three. Why 2 then?  If he was serious, that's bullshit. If he was saying it to clear the table, it's still bullshit. And that's exactly what I did. As soon as I got to a stopping point I got up and left. No one said see you again soon. No one said have a good flight. In fact, I heard him laugh as I walked away.   I'm sorry, but in an airport, you need to be sensitive to why someone is sitting in your restaurant. Sometimes it's because it's the only decent choice. Sometimes it's because they arrived batshit early scared to miss their flight. And sometimes, it's because their flight is delayed a few hours and they don't want to sit on a crappy airport chair. Or there isn't even one of those available.  Most of those scenarios are not good. You have a captive audience. People aren't driving from downtown Phoenix to Sky Harbor to eat at the airport Blanco and go home immediately after. And if I am starving and I order take out because a table is not available but still want to sit, don't be an ass.  I love your food, but the service is enough that I'll go elsewhere next time. It may even drive me to a chain restaurant down the hall."}
{"text":"Stopped off here during a layover and craving tacos. Ordered a Bloody Maria (first time getting the tequila variety) and machaca tacos with corn tortillas. All of the food really hit the spot. Drink was great (although it put me to sleep on the next flight) and the tacos were delicious, even the rice and beans were tasty and not your typical refried beans or anything. Service was fast and friendly, in and out in about a half hour to make my flight. Highly recommended.  I also love coming through Sky Harbor Airport since the food beats most any other airport that I've been through."}
{"text":"What started out as a solid 4 stars steadily dipped to a solid 2, and the 2 only because my shrimp salad was wonderful.   The hostess was a sweetheart, the food was good and the place was clean with great rock tunes playing.  My server was awful, he literally took my order and brought me a water.  Someone else brought my food ... he never once came back and I only got one glass of water.  Despite sitting next to the server station... nobody cleared my plates, offered to bring me more water, nada.  They obviously don't help each other out.   I waited a full 30 minutes post finishing salad and water... oh and writing this review before someone actually noticed I was finished and it was a manager.  Won't be back... walk on by and go to Wildflower or Modern Burger."}
{"text":"I have found yet another rock solid dining option in an airport!  I came across this location during a 2 hour layover and was glad that I did.  I walked up to the hostess stand and was quickly given a seat at  one of the tall tables in the back.  One thing I enjoyed was the euro style seating!  I really don't mind being placed at at able with other customers who I don't know.  IT can certainly make for interesting conversation!  I was also very pleased with the service we all ahd at our table.  There was one server to who took care of all of us and she did a fantastic job!    The food was also pretty amazing.  My burritos was quite hefty and delicious!   I did not expect to see this level of fare until I got it.  Overall a great experience and one I would enmoy again if laid oer in Pheonix!"}
{"text":"Good sized breakfast burritos for $6,all different flavors. Try the chorizo and egg."}
{"text":"Chicken quesadilla, chicken fajitas - sucked. The chicken was flavorless and dry. In fact it tasted as if it was microwaved/ pre-packaged.   And waaaay to expensive.   Will not eat at this chain again."}
{"text":"Not impressed... Connecting in PHX . They did not have shrimp and ran out of guacamole... What Mexican without Guacamole?"}
{"text":"I was really pleasantly surprised by my meal here. I had arrived at a gate pretty much directly across the hall, and so I whipped out my phone, checked its Yelp reviews, and decided to give it a try.  The space itself is nice--not nearly as cheesy as most airport bars/restaurants. I liked that you could look into the (clean) kitchen as you sat at the bar. Bar stools were comfy and spaced far enough apart to allow for luggage behind you.  I ended up asking the bartender for her recommendations, and she suggested the Mexican chopped salad, with corn, guacamole, beans, tortilla & Rancho dressing. At just $11 (which included an extra $3 for grilled chicken), I was expecting a pretty measly portion, but it was huge. All the ingredients seemed really fresh and flavorful, and the corn had clearly been grilled. It was pretty delicious. I also had a Four Peaks Kiltlifter beer, which was good.  The bartender (I think her name was Christine) was friendly but not at all intrusive. Even sitting at the bar, it wasn't too noisy or cramped. My salad was out in just a few minutes--definitely much faster than I was expecting (but great for a layover).  It seemed like a steal, especially for airport fare."}
{"text":"My order was disappointing. I ordered a quesadilla which came in a big box, but when I opened it I was shocked to see 4 small pieces. (See picture)  For the price (almost $8), I should have bought  a pizza."}
{"text":"Delta Bravo 1: Remember that woman Leslie (not real name)? The one who was having an affair.  Delta Bravo 2: Oh yeah, the one married to the cop. Why was she even married to him?   Delta Bravo 1: I don't know. Everyone knows you never marry a cop. They don't make any money, they're always getting shot at and they're never home.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  That's just part of the enlightening conversation I overheard from a table of 3 DoucheBags at Blanco Taco & Tequila in the Sky Harbor airport. Other than that, this place was solid for airport fare.  I ordered the Machaca and egg breakfast burrito. Tender short rib, scrambled eggs, pico de gallo and Mexican cheese served with potatoes.   It was really good and it came out from the kitchen really fast. Due to the speed, it's obviously all pre-made then thrown together upon order. In an airport, where time can be of the essence this is understandable.   After a little bit of research, I learned that Blanco Taco and Tequila is part of the Fox Restaurant Concepts family. I've become fairly acquainted with these Fox restaurants since moving to Phoenix and I have to say I'm a fan."}
{"text":"The good was fresh and delicious!  Te service was exceptional. Our server, Sandra, was very polite, informative, and friendly. My wife and I both had the Loaded Carnitas Burritos Enchilada Style and it was amazing. The flavors were explosive and the texture of the meat was spot on. We started with the Guacamole and Salsa and ate it all! If you're in gate A check them out!"}
{"text":"Braised Pork Tacos not bad at all! Definitely a good choice. Staff is very friendly. Food came out pretty fast too! And definitely nice to sit on the high tops and be able to charge your phone. Not a bad spot for a layover!"}
{"text":"Bumping this one up to a 3 after giving it a \"1\". Business owner contacted me with the actions taken and offer for a certificate.  While I'm not interested in the certificate I did appreciate his response and certainly willing to try the location again.  I will note that another response was sent to me separately that sounded oddly like the waitress. If her, I'm fairly sure she isn't connecting the dots to the issue and serving/being a solutions provider for customers hopefully her life experiences will train her better in the future."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best meal I've ever eaten in any airport anywhere (and I've been in a  lot airports).  At the waiters suggestion, I ordered huevos rancheros (without sour cream) and coffee for breakfast.  The food was awesome -- the perfect mixtures of sunny side up eggs, potatos, sausage, beans and cheese.  Not good for a diet -- a guilty pleasure for sure.  Will always eat there when in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This is best airport food I've ever had!  We started with chips, quesa,salsa and guac.  The chips were freshly fried and hot, the salsa wonderfully made with chipotle, but not very spicy at al.  The guac was smooth and well seasoned..  All in all, I could have just ordered this and a drink and would have considered the meal a success.  Luckily I didn't stop here...  This is a popular/busy spot but with the wait. Since the chips are made fresh, it took a bit for us to receive them, so I was a little concerned about our connecting flight. I informed the waitress that we were in a bit of a hurry.   She, ensured that I steer clear of a couple of items that typically take longer to serve...(The fajitas and, surprisingly, the cheese crisp).  My husband and I each ordered soup and wanted to share a salad, and my kids ordered quesadillas.  We are all happy with our selections, (which is a feat considering our picky, foodie family).  The girls loved their three cheese quesadillas but should have shared one instead of ordering two.  The tortilla soup is a very hearty portion size as well... I couldn't finish it all so took the rest, as well as my shrimp chopped salad, to go.  The soup is cream based with just a hint of heat and is different than the traditional broth based versions I typically have, and love.  I welcome the change...it was delicious!  I also ordered the shrimp chopped salad, which is tangy and slightly spicy, reminiscent of of a civeche...refreshing and delicious.  There are a myriad of of tequilas on the menu and some interesting variations on the traditional margarita.  I typically enjoy a classic, however decided to try the grapefruit pomegranate.  I was not disappointed!  I will order this every chance I get.  I think. from now on, I'll attempt to schedule all West coast connections through Sky Harbour, just to afford me the opportunity to dine here again!"}
{"text":"Good place but it is very cramped at first I didn't want any food but when I tried my friends quesadilla I was hooked and wanted more."}
{"text":"Worst service. None of the waitresses or waiters care. Ended up leaving because no one cared to serve us anything. Worst restaurant staff attitude and everything."}
{"text":"Please have more vegan dishes and your business will improve we are a growing number!!!!!! Watch forks over knives!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service! Airport dining that rivals any restaurant of its kind. Can't say enough about the level of service. Really excellent and well-stocked bar...tequila choices are phenomenal."}
{"text":"Very disappointing service. After waiting for our table for 10 minutes, we sat down and were informed they were only serving the after 9pm late night menu, when it was only 8pm. The waiter than said (very unapologetic) we can't serve salads which were clearly listed as an item.   I used to work at Blanco years back, and knew how excellent the service was. Generally Fox restaurants are very accommodating so I was very disappointed this evening when the staff did not meet the Fox standards."}
{"text":"Okay so this is more about service than food but food would have only been a two. No less than three employees looked at me while cleaning tables but said nothing. One woman finally asked me how many and I said one. She then went to clean off a high-top for another customer. WTF?? It took about 12-15 minutes to get a drink ordered and delivered. This is an airport. 1. People are normally pressed for time and 2. There is not a large seating area.   When I finally got my Mexican Chopped Salad, it was mediocre at best. Soggy lettuce and barely flavorful dressing. It was by no means a chopped salad. There was lettuce, meat, dressing, and cheese/sour cream (?).   I tried to give my server my credit card when he brought my food to expedite my leaving. He said - I'm going to just leave this right here and placed it on the table. Huh? He then explained the computer system was down. So I asked if he could take cash. He said SURE! So I handed him a $20. He gave it back and said that he had no way to calculate my bill. Seriously? Have you ever heard of a calculator? The prices are in the menu. Ugh So you can't take my credit card and you won't take my cash. What do I do when my flight starts to board? He just shrugged his shoulders."}
{"text":"The fast foods chains at the airport need to just shut down an go away. The breakfast burrito and tater-tots were fresh and DELISH! Then there was the service. Wow! A pleasant smile and great conversation. We were in and out in 15 minutes. Concourse A. Check it out."}
{"text":"I really like this place. Stopped by for lunch before catching a flight. I like the atmosphere here - and it also appears to be a popular hangout among travelers at this terminal.   They have most of the popular Mexican beers by the bottle, a few craft beers on tap, nine different types of wines and a nice selection of tequilas. Calm down, before everyone gets excited - they also have margaritas, sangria and other signature cocktails!  I ordered a three taco platter, which includes beans and rice. The nice thing here is that you are allowed to mix and match different types of tacos (our server was nice enough to point that out to us).   I went for two carne asada tacos and one chipotle shrimp. I really liked the carne asada, but for me the shrimp tacos tasted amazing. Next time I will order three of these. Or maybe six.  Our server got our drinks orders in quickly and delivered our food pretty fast, despite the fact that it was fairly busy when we were there.   Give Blanco's a try if you want something different than the typical airport fare. Food is amazing, service is great and the people are friendly."}
{"text":"I am Blancos newest ex-customer for life. I have spent large amounts of money on work and family meals at Blancos.  Although the food is overpriced, the atmosphere has a good vibe (@Scottsdale blvd location). Unfortunately, today I stopped by the airport location in terminal 4. Before I could sit and relax on a very busy morning, the hostess with the mostess attitude noticed we had just came from Modern Burger next door. She said a server would be right over. Almost immediately a guy that looked like a derelict came over and asked us if we would  like to order. I explained that we are going to have our sandwich and would be ordering a drink in a minute. He proceeded to tell us to come back when we were ready to order.  I asked him why he was being so hostile at 7:00am with an empty restaurant. He then asked us to leave again. I was shocked. Apparently he has an issue with authority at home and has allowed it to carryover to work.  Needless to say, and after reading other reviews on this location, Blanco will fail miserably.  Upsetting patrons at the airport will surely impact their other locations.  They just lost well over a thousand dollars a year from me and my employer."}
{"text":"What's the difference between a Quesadilla and a Burrito?  They haven't a clue.  Ordered one, got the other.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"The best bartender award at sky harbor airport has to go to Doug Vicars he's  awesome at everything he does!!  He's handsome too!  Oh and he makes the best skinny margaritas."}
{"text":"Great food and fast service. Excellent when you are at the airport chasing airplanes."}
{"text":"4 stars my first time, 3 stars my second.  1st time: bomb Caesar dressing with lots of cojita cheese.  Super fast service  2nd time: off menu rice bowl that they do \"all the time\" Rice wasn't good. I also don't like beans. So there wasn't much else to compare. It took forever! I saw the two guys who sat down right before us already finished eating, so I knew something went wrong with our server's orders.  It's def a good place to stop, especially if you have time for a marg. Typically should be super fast, but not sure what went wrong. I saw many others next to me waiting for their food for a long time.   Next time."}
{"text":"If possible, would leave a 0/5 stars. My entire party had an issue with their dish (hair in food, raw cooked, food prepared incorrectly). Very unprofessional sever. The side of guacamole was HARD and COLD. When asking the server if it was normally prepared this way, he's response was, \"Oh yeah, that is pretty weird, I wouldn't eat it like that.\" HE WOULDN'T EVEN EAT IT AND DID NOT REPLACE THE ITEM. Waited around for his tip like a hawk then disappeared. Do not waste your money or time."}
{"text":"I was very surprised to see Sam Fox places all over the air port on my way to Jamaica this past week.   My boyfriend and I stopped in for some pre flight drinks. It was alright, decently prices, service was a little weird, waitress lingered way too long and checked on us way too much. Almost thought she might have had the hotts for my man.   We didn't eat but everyone's food looked decent. They need some more TVs if they are going to offer sports at all, you can only see them from a few places in the main dining area.   A-OK is about right."}
{"text":"Just fine for airport eating. Since I had lots of time to kill, I decided to eat dinner here. The menu is your basic Tex-Mex favorites - tacos, burritos and the like.  I had a \"crisper\" which is basically an open faced quesadilla with chicken, pico and poblanos. It really wasn't bad at all - the chicken was nice and moist and the veggies were fresh. Definitely a step up from the usual greasy airport choices.  If you are in the mood or afraid to fly, they have an extensive margarita menu. I saw lots of them coming out both by the glass and the pitcher. Prices are a little high, but that's to be expected in an airport. You can do worse.   PS - eat up before your flight. Don't be \"that guy\" who brings a stinky burrito on my flight and makes the whole plane smell like Taco Bell. That guy sucks."}
{"text":"I would give 3.5 stars if I could.  The servers are rather attentive and the space is nice.  The breakfast burrito seems to be the rage here but I say for lunch.  The three braised short rib tacos I had were pleasant but not particular flavorful.   The beans were an item to pass, but the rice was tasty.    They do have a nice variety of bottle and local craft draft beers."}
{"text":"4 stars keeping in mind it's airport food.  The machaca burrito was delicious and large.  Could have used a couple more vegetarian options for my wife."}
{"text":"Airport restaurants have never been my favorite. Always overpriced but what the heck. Looking for breakfast and saw breakfast burrito. This place is within the Terminal 4 A wing gate just past gate A4.   Wasn't expecting much but the take-out line was short so I ordered the matcha and egg burrito. Very surprised. The tortilla was hot, thin, and down right good. Matcha was tender and juicy but just juicy enough so that it's not dripping down your arm while eating it. The eggs were very good too. So I really loved my morning matcha breakfast burrito.   Yes a little overpriced but everything is overpriced at airports. Food good. Service fast. So if your looking for a quick and good breakfast burrito, I recommend this place. Enjoy and happy flying. I sure am."}
{"text":"Really beyond expectations for airport food but only 3 stars because on the outside, compared to other Mexican, it lacks the spice and flavor I prefer in my Mexican food.  The kids portion is huge and my ordinarily big eaters both left food behind.  One kiddo ordered the cheese quesadilla and so it was super easy to package it up in their to-go container to eat on the plane.  I got the Mexican pizza and that was also huge.  They were fast (35 min from seating to leaving) giving us plenty of time before our departure.  Bottom line:   Recommend for the airport"}
{"text":"On a layover headed back to Los Angeles.  The food reviews scared me, so I came ONLY to satisfy my liquid diet (beer & tequila).  The price was fair, relative to the 'rape' that occurs at every airport when you eat, or drink there.  This place is hip/trendy and the majority of the people coming in appear to be on the young/attractive side (no joke).  I was also happy because they have a few television monitors streaming sports, sorry I'm a guy drinking beer.  The beer selection is not huge, but their tequila selection was fair, 30+.  Nothing too exotic, but all the usual suspects, which worked fine for me.    I found this to be a good social watering hole on my way home.  I enjoyed some good conversation with a few bar patrons, and the service on this day was not too bad.  I look forward to a return visit."}
{"text":"Very good chicken burrito. Very friendly service. These guys are also prompt. Would stop here next time I am at this airport."}
{"text":"walking through the airport on way to gate. Thinking about the nasty food I'll likely eat when I reach it. Pass by Blanco. Angels singing with ray of light. I've been to the location in the Tucson hills. Its consistently great food. What a nice surprise in an otherwise awful food environment. Way to go Phoenix airport. Fish tacos were a solid choice."}
{"text":"Service here is lukewarm.  That being said, everything else is awesome for an airport eatery.  Serious!  I was here for breakfast and the amount of food you are served for $9 is absolutely incredible.  I ordered the burrito with chorizo and eggs.  I didn't really want it burrito-style so they served it with the tortilla on the side.  Thanks!  Two people should split this meal.  Massive heapings of eggs with chorizo along with a huge portion of home fried potatoes which were also very good and crunchy.  I was seated alone at one of the \"high\" tables and low and behold, each table has multiple plug ins for your electronics.  I immediately plugged in my laptop and phone to get full charge prior to my flight.  A tremendous value.  If you're with someone, split the meal."}
{"text":"Who knew we could get better tasting Mexican food in the airport than many of the places by our house?!  I had grilled chicken breast tacos (the rice that comes with it is so creamy and was quite possibly sent down from heaven) and my fiancé has the beef nachos and wouldn't stop raving about the queso.   Also the sangria rojo is very strong and delicious if you have pre-flight jitters like me!"}
{"text":"Service was efficient. Food wasn't good but the concept of shrimp salad with jicama, radish, cucumber, cabbage with spring lettuce does. The shrimp was tough. The dressing was good on the side to keep the portion the way I prefer."}
{"text":"On a red-eye layover to Newark I stopped here for dinner and a beer and had one of the best burritos, pleasant surprise b/c airport food usually isn't that great.   carnitas burrito is what I ordered."}
{"text":"Excellent grilled fish for the fish tacos...not breaded and fried.  Perfectly cooked and served hot.  I would order these again and again!  Accompanied with a bloody mary and I was ready for the remaining leg of my journey home to HNL."}
{"text":"Pretty good place at the airport for a bite to eat.  Service was quick, which is a plus at the airport.  Food was good."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix sky harbor for a short layover. Blanco's staff was quick to seat me, take my order and attentive to my needs. I ordered the Huevos Rancheros with bacon and it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to place when I'm at Phoenix airport. It's really good for airport food! Loved the guac & chips. Quick service."}
{"text":"Yum for airport food the breakfast burrito is pretty darn tasty. If Darlene waits on you remember she is a jokester. Very funny and a nice change to the usual \"I hate my job\" airport personnel you will sometimes encounter. Ask to be seated in her section."}
{"text":"isn't there only one \"L\" in tequila ?????  i usually make a point of avoiding airport food but astoundingly poor service from US AIRWAYS and we found ourselves stranded at SKY HARBOR long enough we couldn't avoid getting something in our tummies without risking the kids having a feed-me-now meltdown at thirty-eight thousand feet.  walked by the nearly full seating area at BLANCO TACOS and TEQUILA and most of the plates looked enticing enough to give the place a try.  ordered the SHORT RIB QUESADILLA and CHIPS and GUACAMOLE. the quesadilla was pretty much a greasy mess. the short ribs were grossly under seasoned and moist enough that the tortilla required a spoon and pile of napkins to eat and not in a good way.    the CHIPS were pretty standard like something from the snack aisle at the local mega-mart but the guacamole was actually pretty good.  i was trying to accommodate the kid's appetites and suspect the food would have been better with a different menu choices. i guess if you go to a place called TACOS and TEQUILLA and have neither you gotta assume some of the responsibility for a less than stellar experience ..."}
{"text":"I stopped in here because it was the only restaurant in the Delta terminal at the Phoenix airport that also had a bar. I started off with a bloody mary, which is my traditional drink either before or during a flight. They had a 'Hispanic twist' on theirs and I wasn't too big of a fan. Then, I ordered one of their regular classic margaritas. It was pretty good and much bigger than I expected. The food was all from the restaurant next door and was mostly tacos and burritos. I wasn't really in the mood for any of those, so I just ordered a side of chips with guacamole and salsa. They were pretty average - good enough to eat but nothing to write home about. If I am in that terminal again, I will probably eat at Wendy's and then get a drink at this bar."}
{"text":"The saving grace of my visit to Blanca was my waitress, Charlotte.  She was wonderful and made my layover (after a long us airways delay) more pleasant.  She and the other waitstaff were seemingly the hardest workers at this business.  The kitchen closed early (15 minutes early) despite managers being onsite- lazy!!!  Charlotte brought me chips and salsa as I didn't want a heavy, gluten filled burrito.  She offered to have me to talk with a manager, but she did more than enough to make up for the restaurant not serving over half the menu 15 minutes before closing. Sit in her section if you are stuck sky harbor."}
{"text":"Well that was a surprise for airport food! Great margaritas and food. Strangely enough, their beans and rice were probably my favorite part of the meal. Drinks are slightly cheaper than most airport selections but a double is $4 more instead of the standard $2.  Food comes out quickly and my server was really chill. He was totally cool with me getting just a margarita but I ended up eating more than I should have. :)"}
{"text":"Actually, a little surprised at the food, given that it is an airport restaurant.  Also, they started serving lunch at 10am, which was good for me since I had already taken an early morning flight to get to Phoenix and had my share of breakfast.  Had two tacos with ground beef on corn tortillas.  Could have had a little more more pico de gallo or salsa or something, but they were stuffed enough to fall out and I had to scoop up with my fork.  The iced tea was brewed and also good.  The tacos and the beverage was $14.48 before gratuity.  Had both tables and shared high toppers."}
{"text":"Sandra at Blancos Tacos in terminal 4 is the best server I've ever had at the airport and one of the best servers I've meet anywhere."}
{"text":"Worst service that I have ever experienced at any restaurant at Sky Harbor. Sat for 20 minutes and never evem got to order a drink.   Three different waitresses walked past me twelve different times.  Never a greeting or even eye contact.    I guess they don't need my money tonight. Bye!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly.  The Manager rolled out the red carpet for me, Great service and good food.  I had the machaca breakfast burrito.  Delish!"}
{"text":"I was heading to Vegas so what better way to start off the flight then catching a couple margaritas right before? So I ordered the White Peach Margarita which was too sweet. Don't do it to yourself and I love Margaritas. I then tried the original and it was just alright. Nothing to rave about, but if I had more time I would have gone to Chili's. Blanco looks nice, great ambiance, but it's mostly hype and it was right next to my gate. You live, you learn."}
{"text":"The food was delicious but my experience with the floor manager Louis was terrible. He hid in the kitchen while he left a single bar tender out to contain the masses during a lunch rush. The poor gal was doing what she could but it was too much. Not once did he intervene.  When I confronted him on this issue as well as his kitchen staff eating while preparing guest meals -- he proceeded to call airport security on me. I'm the least threatening person possible and I never once used threatening tones or language -- even the security guards laughed at the situation. He was mad that I called him out on his lack of doing his job...  Bottom line, the food is great but if you arrive around lunch time, don't expect the management to manage the situation when and if they get short handed."}
{"text":"Delicious! Fast seating and service. Had the skinny margarita and the Mexican pizza with cheese and guacamole and my sucky day at the airport got better! The restaurant is nice and modern the only thing I would recommend is for the music the be less loud."}
{"text":"Awesome spot to spend our time waiting for our fight.   Tina is a badass behind the bar and Chis is a great waitress.   All around good times and would def come back again and recommend anyone to do the same!"}
{"text":"Dropped in during a layover at Sky Harbor. Since it was breakfast time, at least locally, I went for one of their several burrito options - chorizo and eggs. They did recognize that it might be lunch to other people, and offered me the lunch menu as well, which was nice.   My server asked if I wanted sour cream or avocado as well, since the chorizo was spicy. I went with a bit of sour cream. The burrito came out quickly and was served with some very nice fried potatoes as well.   The chorizo was medium hot, just about right, and the burrito was good sized and loaded with eggs and a bit of green onion as well. Very tasty.   I had some time so decided to hang for a bit and they didn't make me feel pressured to leave at all. Nice.   Their beer selection is not great but there are a couple of nice ones in there, as well as a full bar.  This place is worth a visit!  Airport food can suck But stop here for a good time Food and service rock"}
{"text":"Great service  and so fast, that's what you need in the airport in five minutes they give me my food good I like it ;-)"}
{"text":"Friendly server. Didn't feel rushed to leave (flight delayed) even though I was alone and they were near capacity. Food was good for an airport, but would be disappointing anywhere else. Ordered roasted chicken tacos. Chicken tasty, but pico in need of flavor. Asked for taco sauce and received generic bottle of pepper sauce. Still okay though. Inexcusable, however, was the fact that they were OUT OF CHIPS!!! No chips and salsa at 10:00 p.m. on a Thursday. At an airport restaurant full of folks drinking beer rather than eating. Can't be good business."}
{"text":"so, first you think 4 stars? in an airport?  yeah, its, just that ok! In PHX on this wing of the airport, there is only like 2 spots for some booze before the flight.  Olive and Ivy may be the only other option, but they had me at Tequila.  Tacos are also welcome.  My current crush of Tequila is Casamigos.  I recently found out it was owned by George Cloony and some others.  Not dissimilar from Cabo Wabo, but pretty good.  I like Repasado (thanks Mula!).  They have it. In an airport.  Vegan options suck, but they were able to throw some shit together and the roasted mushie tacos rocked. Decent local beers like 4 peaks and Barrio.  Wine good enough for Wifle.  I will make this a stop each time I come through"}
{"text":"We ordered the fajita (Streak and shrimp) it was perfectly seasoned and had sour cream on top. Brought rice and black beans (good) and bought delightful soft taco shells, but they were too small.   The mushroom, moxaca, pork combo taco plate was also very tasty but nothing special. This was actually a very good meal especially since it was airport food.  The local beers on tap were also very good and our waitress was great."}
{"text":"I've learned to expect very little from airport restaurants.  Now I've been ruined - I went to Blanco and my paltry expectations were blown out of the water. Prompt and attentive service, flavorful and delicious food, and a delightful assortment of drink options.  I'll have to connect through Phoenix for the rest of my life.   I had the grilled shrimp salad, which was fresh, flavorful, and filling. I also had the sangria, which was pretty good. My friends had tacos (fish and carnitas); they practically licked their plates clean.  Try the rice - it is a rich and delectable treat.   An added bonus: They were patient as we sat for three hours waiting for our connecting flight. If I ever find myself in this airport again, you can be sure I'll make my way here."}
{"text":"Holy shitake!  Good airport food?  On the go?  In Phoenix?  I decided on a breakfast burrito with braised short ribs.  FOODGASM!  Every bite was an explosion of flavor with large, extremely tender, juicy beef.  So simple, so good.  Enough said."}
{"text":"Well we you are stuck over night at an airport my first thought was, well lets have a few drinks and hope to pass out in the corner somewhere! Unfortunately I walked up to the bar around 11pm and that also happened to be closing time! So I got a brew and hope the bartenders would keep the fun going for a bit! They did, saying last call, then last last call, then last last last ps last call.. But all good things do come to an end, and the Coors Light only flowed so far and now you are on your own as the cleaning crews come out and the airplanes say good night!"}
{"text":"This is a live Yelp coming to you straight from the corner seat at the bar. I've only been here 5 minutes and I'm already awarding this place 5 stars.  I should only give 4 stars because the kitchen is out of everything but quesadillas and burritos, but I'm just so impressed by the bar tending staff's genuine connection and friendliness to their guests that I really can't help myself. (This is an airport bar, right? Many of us will never be back because we are just passing through on a fluke, yet we are being treated as valued guests. How refreshing!).  Thanks to Whitney, Darlene, and the rest of the smiling team! You guys made me happy today!   (Did I mention that the WiFi here is ridiculously fast. Bonus!)"}
{"text":"Nice place and appreciated the modern lighting and atmosphere. I would have to agree with other yelpers, the blood orange margarita was great!  I also enjoyed my shrimp salad it was good size, tasty, filled with avo and jimca, a perfect combo.  My husband tried the Caesar salad with added steak and he said it was excellent!  The steak pieces looked rather small to me but he liked it."}
{"text":"STAY AWAY-  Bought food at window of Blanco and then went to sit at one of the 19 empty tables. I was told I had to go and eat at another restaurant even though the food I had I just purchased from  them. Seems you can only use their tables if you purchase more food and drinks from the bar. Just got off a long flight and as a disabled veteran I was in a lot of pain and just wanted to eat. Seems the $23 I just spent on food from them was not enough for a seat. Manger said \"thanks for your service but you still have to eat at another restaurant with  that food as you bought if from our window and not table\" Stay away not military or customer friendly at all!"}
{"text":"We were hungry before our flight to Fort Lauderdale so decided to get a couple of breakfast burritos. The burritos looked really good, that was the best part of the experience. The line to order was complete chaos, but hey, it's an airport so I forgive them. However, once we reached the register, the girl who takes the orders, and you know who you are, is the rudest employee I have ever encountered in any restaurant in my entire life. I almost walked away before ordering, which would have been the correct decision, but my family and I were starving and had already waited in line. I ordered two bacon breakfast burritos, and the rude employee yelled to me with attitude that my number is 2! This was also confirmed on my receipt that she gave me, number 2. Now, I waited amidst the chaos for the food to get done (took about 10 minutes), and then the girl yells out number 6! Nobody goes up to the counter, nobody had a number 6. Then she yells out, two bacon breakfast burritos! I went up to the counter and let her know, I think that's mine, but my order is number 2. She shoves the bag of food into my hands, rolls her eyes, and walks away. I was blown away that these people are still in business! I wish I had the girl's name, as I would be happy to pass it along to airport management. She was about 5'5, had black hair, was a thin Mexican, was working on Saturday February 8th at 9:00 a.m on the register at the walk up window. The food was absolutely terrible by the way, it was the worst breakfast burrito I have had in my life hands down. Sonic makes a better breakfast burrito, and I HATE Sonics breakfast burrito. Two burritos, a water and a chocolate milk were $22.68.Save your money!"}
{"text":"What a lovely little retreat in the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport. I've been traveling al day trying to make it back home to El Paso from Vermont. I haven't eaten all day and tacos sounded great. I followed other Yelp recommendations and ordered the machaca tacos on corn tortillas. The plate was vibrant with tacos topped with cabbage, peppers, tomatoes, and cotija cheese; a bowl of black beans; and a white rice with veggies. My first bite was of the rice. It was cooked perfectly. I bit into the tacos--generous meat portions, juicy, and full of flavor. I cleaned my plate. Service was a little slow to start off, but overall my server was really on it. Neat spot to visit it you have some time at the airport."}
{"text":"Last week I was flying through terminal 4, A gates and I stopped by Blanco (which I normally love, I go to the one located in Scottsdale) and was completely appalled by what I witnessed.  First I was unable to move to a different table. I was sat at a small table with my child and wanted to move to a bigger table and my server told me the section was \"closed.\" The restaurant was completely empty, but whatever I went with it. A bit later the restaurant got completely full and my same server began taking tables in this empty section and she got SO busy she wasn't even able to pay attention to me or the people around me.  Then, I witnessed what was the manager I believe speaking very derogatory towards her employees. Her communication consisted of looking at her phone and rolling her eyes at employees. As someone who has also worked in this environment, I have experienced how challenging it can be to be a server. Your staff shouldn't have to feel disrespected by management. Whoever she is, is running the restaurant terribly and not setting an example at all for her employees! She was an older woman with shoulder length grey hair. Definitely not hospitable at all for someone that is supposed to be working in the hospitality industry. Good luck! Due to this experience I will never go to this location ever again and I will also be telling my friends and family about my unfortunate experience."}
{"text":"The tacos were very spicy. I liked the chips and salsa but my son and daughter-in-law Felt it was average. Service could have been better. Sean and Nat did not get all rice as requested and I was given all beans also instead of all rice. I said no pico and there was the pico on my tacos. Just make sure you have plenty of time to catch your flight Gluten free options and other locations have gluten free menu."}
{"text":"Heading home. Sleep deprived and hungover.  Machaca and egg breakfast burrito was ridiculously good.  Feeling much better now :)"}
{"text":"I had a layover in PHX and this was near both of my gates.  It was late (9pm) so the menu was limited to only certain items, but the full bar was still available.  I had red sangria, but only one glass as it was way to sweet - ick!  Cheese quesadilla had like 4 cheeses and oozed . . . I got chicken and it was shredded.  Not much more in there.  The service was nothing special.  I wish I had gotten more guacamole than just on the side.  I also wish they had queso, but they didn't even if the menu wasn't limited.  They also have a to-go.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Some over priced Mexican food in the airport."}
{"text":"Good airport restaurant. Tacos were good and tasted fresh. We tried mahi mahi, carne asada, chicken, and pork. Rice and beans were good. Service was a tad slow for an airport spot, but we had time to kill so it was fine. The tables for 2 are really close together and feels like you are dining with the tables next to you."}
{"text":"Had a little more time than usual to spare getting onto a flight. I looked around and thought about the fast service places but this one looked more attractive and it was crowded. The greeter walked me to a seat at the long tables where it is a little difficult to manage. The spacing is tight and when you add luggage to this, well, it becomes a greater challenge.  Going solo I balanced everything to the side and in front of me (yes, it's possible) and sat down to order a drink and quickly chose the taco carnitas off the menu in flour tortillas. Service was attentive, the food was good, and, most importantly, I was able to get out of there quick to still be ahead of my boarding time which is important to me because I am one of those never check bags when flying solo kind of people."}
{"text":"Great spot for beers and tacos.  Guacamole was on point.  Bartender Chris was on it.  Great job!"}
{"text":"I stopped at Blanco preflight to have a drink. I was seated at a two top, which gave me space for all of my stuff. The service was very efficient and friendly. The drink (blood orange marg) was decent and priced reasonably, especially for an airport. I'm pretty sure the Fox restaurants in the airport have the same prices as at their regular restaurants, which I appreciate. I wouldn't make a special trip to come here, but I would come back if it were convenient."}
{"text":"Good place to have real food while waiting for your plane. I had a salad with tortilla chips and steaks. This was pretty tasty and good. However they don't have hot tea. Only coffee. They serve several drinks and Mexican pizza which were like nachos. They also had good guacamole as well which I had in my salad.  Will stop by here again if I'm back in the same airport."}
{"text":"Was excited to see some new places at Sky Harbor since I'm there every week.  Went to Blanco for a breakfast burrito.  First off, it was wayyyy to big a tortilla for the amount of eggs in there.  And yes it was just eggs, not eggs and cheese as they had promised (at least I couldn't find the cheese).  Plus the tortilla itself had a wierd sweetness to it and was very greasy.  I ended up just pulling out the eggs and trashing everything else.  Very disappointed, and woud be better off at another place, at least for breakfast."}
{"text":"Holy guacamole! Who knew that you could get amazing tex mex in the airport? Blanco was a very pleasant surprise. We were starving and knew we'd need sustenance before a 6 hour flight to Hnl. The lure of tex mex and a smartly designed restaurant drew us in. All I can say is yum yum yum! The tacos were so delish. The machata pork was so soft it was melting in my mouth. The accompanying rice and beans were impeccably flavored. Chips and salsa were also delicious and not too greasy. Note though that they come at an extra $2. Solid 4 stars. Decent prices for authentic Mexican fare. Bonus points for great service and the fact that its in an airport!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent - especially for airport food. The carne asada tacos were great."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, Phoenix Sky boasts some pretty solid food options!  Running on empty after a long day of work, and finally heading back home, I was excited at the possibility of some Mexican food before my flight back to the OC.    Usually I would never order a quesdilla from a Mexican restaurant (the idea being anything I can easily make myself is out of the question), but upon looking at the menu, I was immediately sold.    Melted Oaxaca, Asadero & Manchego Cheeses on a Crisp Flour Tortilla with Machaca?!  $9 for an airport version of this was right up my alley.    The food came out fast, and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Solid.  4 Stars"}
{"text":"Trendy but average taco place.  Atmosphere is nice, but that's about it. Service was just ok.  I had the grilled fish tacos. 3 tacos to an order but portion size of the fish was on the smallish side.  For those wanting to avoid the rice as an included side, you can double up on the beans."}
{"text":"It's an airport restaurant so at a point your like well it's an airport restaurant and then you think and your like so it's still a restaurant.  Ok so it took about 5 minutes at the bar just to see a menu. I think we came in at changing of the guards because there was no logic to what the servers/bar was doing.    Then when we finically got a menu we are a party of 2 we tried to give him our whole order at once just so we wouldn't have to wait another 5 min just to put in a food order cause come on who has that much time to sit around when their plane is scheduled to arrive. Well our bartender couldn't do 2 drunk order and a food item so he said he would come back. That's after he made our drinks. If he spent less time trying to be fancy pouring and throwing stuff in the trash he prob would have had more time to notice other people who needed service too.   If it wasn't for the fact the good was pretty decent and came out relatively quickly I would have gave it 2 stars. Management should hire people who are more aggressive to make money and have a little bit more personality cause airport restaurants servers have even less time to build a small relationship with guests and all it takes is a little \"welcome hi\" and a smile or a \"I'll be right with you\" I'd rather go to a fast food place and pick up a meal than sit at a bar with an inattentive friendly bartender"}
{"text":"Airport food can be a gamble, but this spot has great, flavorful food. We had the guacamole (pretty dang good), I had a burrito (asked for shrimp instead of pork/chicken and it was no problem at all) with rice and beans, and everything was delicious. Our waitress was really sweet and the host was also really cool! Good food and a cool spot to hang out. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I had to sit at a \"community table\" which wasn't my first choice, but the place was packed.  The server was very attentive, even though she was super busy.  I enjoyed the guacamole and chips.  You could tell the guac was freshly made.  The carnitas tacos were delicious and served with black beans and rice.  The rice was a little dried out, but everything else was yummy."}
{"text":"We ordered the nachos which had white cheese which tasted delicious. Food closes around 915pm but the bar stays open"}
{"text":"My flight was delayed at the gate right next to this place.  I dropped by for a quick margarita while I waited to board.  The margarita was really good and the service was great.  I will definitely be back next time I'm at the airport!!"}
{"text":"Okay. Very expensive. I know it's an airport bit I'm not sure the guacamole even was an entire avocado. It didn't help that they served it in a huge bowl making it seem even smaller. It was good but it's has avocado so it should be good. It wasn't anything special. They were out of my first choice beer, out of queso cheese so we couldn't get nachos (though they did give us free chips and salsa), and then ran out of chips!!! The food was okay. Nothing special. Oh well it's an airport."}
{"text":"For airport food, it place is OK. Service was actually pretty good. I ordered a carne asade tacos that came with rice. I honestly don't care for the rice - took 2 bites and that was it. The tacos were so dry I couldn't eat it without pouring salsa on them. Portion is generous though. If you are hungry that will definitely fill you up for a few hours before your flight takes off."}
