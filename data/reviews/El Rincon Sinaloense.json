{"text":"I've been living in AZ for over a year and could not find good Mexican food until 6/20/2015. I found this place the food is fucken good.  Hand made tortillas are really good. I highly RECOMEND this restaurant.  I will be going here whenever I get a chance."}
{"text":"This is true Sinaloa style food. I would go back for sure. The service is great and friendly. We had the corn tamales. They were fresh and delicious. We also had, gorditas, frijoles, arroz, sopa fresca, barbacoa, and finally dessert, flan. Everything was delish! The server Abigail was friendly and fast. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone wanting a piece of Mexican food."}
{"text":"Friendly service, really good food!  Will be coming here again! :)   The barbacoa and the beans are amazing. Along with the freshly maid tortillas!"}
{"text":"Little place in the corner of the plaza did it right! Brought my friend and I over to this establishment a couple of days ago. It was awesome!  We both had the \"Chilorio con huevo\" that also comes with beans and a good Chunk of cheese . We also shared a Tostada. It was great! Good morning breakfast accompanied by great people and service. Couldn't ask for more. Also fresh tortillas. My next goal is to keep going for breakfast on my days off so I can try all their stuff."}
{"text":"I would of given it 5 stars but the owner of the location seem really rude with her employees and Me and My group. The food itself wasn't that great either for the time we had to wait and when they made a mistake with one of the orders instead of giving Me another dish, they tried to fix the one they made the mistake with thinking I wasn't gonna notice it was the same one."}
{"text":"I came to this place because I follow the instagram  account of the owners son, @tamariindo and he is usually posting very good pictures of food from this place. I live in California and was coming from a trip, happened to drive through Phoenix and I remembered that I wanted to check this place out. Like always I have to be honest I am a very very picky eater the food must be good in order for me to eat it.  I ordered a \"Tostada\"- bomb.com then I ordered a taco Hazz, hand made tortilla, it came with carne asada and a anaheim chile with melted cheese and lettuce, the meat was very soft. (Extra plus) for my sons I ordered a taco de carne asada again very soft meat and hand mase tortilla. My husband ordered a \"Enchiladas Rancheras\" it is three enchiladas stuffed with beans and cheese and on the side frijoles puercos! Oh man those must be the best enchiladas we've had in a long time! To drink I had a agua de Jamaica and my husband had a agua de cevada! Both  just perfect to taste. Overall this place brought back that taste of Mexico cooking( sinaloa/nayarit style) very simple yet that taste is just perfect!"}
{"text":"We ordered menudo blanco , a plate of Barbacoa frijoles puercos and sopa fria along with a side tamale de elote...I have to say this is the most authentic and delicious meal I've had outside of my nanas kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised with how much flavor the food had without having to over spice it!!! I'm just in awe with this hidden gem. I mean how will I ever eat at a Mexican restaurant again with out falling short  it to this place?! Super Delicious you will NOT be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food and very friendly service. Home made tortillas are delicious. Birria also was very tasty."}
{"text":"They took a little too long to take my order. I ordered chilorio con verduras, but I doubt the cook tasted the dish for seasoning before leaving the kitchen, it needed salt, but it wasn't bad. The service was very slow and they were only serving about 4 tables. You were able to hear and feel the tension. They weren't busy, they were just not running things efficiently. They tried their best, yes, but a very quick \"thank you\" came off as: \"We're too busy, go home now.\" I don't think their intentions were bad, it's just that they need to relax and organize themselves better."}
{"text":"Very Tasty real Mexican! Very Sinaloan! Authentic. Anything you order has great flavor. You won't need a salt shaker at all."}
{"text":"Ordered 2 meals to go. About 50min later on a not so busy day... I get a box with 1 meal... N thats it.  I take it in... N they say oh, the other meal. Beef crunchy taco, is underneath ur meal... Literally.  So we look n yes, two soggy tacos... With... A spoon of potatos in it. Maybe a few specs of meat in it.   We were like, really?!  She said its a \"traditional taco\" ..   Even though potatoes were not even listed on the ingredients.   So if u want a complete disaster of a meal, called traditional... Go here."}
