{"text":"Atmosphere was quite nice. Looks very elegant however. The food did not exactly complement it. The food was not the greatest, my chicken was undercooked, nachos were moist and not crunchy at all. Pasta was quite hard as well. Was expecting alot more from this place."}
{"text":"Prices are reasonable and the food quality is great. Good selection, very fresh. Nice tapenade and hot peppers with sliced sourdough bread. The halibut batter isn't too thick and has a surprising but delicious addition of curry. The salmon and shrimp were perfectly cooked. Enjoyed a lentil soup that wasn't over salted but had a great smooth flavour and texture. Also liked the seafood pasta (reasonable amount of fish and a simple marinara sauce) and chicken stirfry. Hidden gem in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and had the butter chicken which was amazing. The service was good and fast. They have an awesome patio which would be good to have a few beers on in the summer. Over all good place for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Bistro at Riverstone Golf & Country Club has a new spring menu. The new menu has something new to try and much more choices. The prices are so affordable considering with a good portion of food. I love their calamari dish which is so delicious with huge portion! Chicken is so tender and has lots of flavours. The restaurant is so clean facing to the patio and it has lots of natural light. My favourite server is Natasha. She works during the day. She is always so cheerful!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. They have a nice patio and dining room area. Will be back here for sure."}
