{"text":"Went in for some late night food with a group of friends. Good place to eat at night. Good service and food is pretty fair. Desserts are better so go for that. Everything is pretty inexpensive too so that is a plus. Good layed-back place to end the night. I approve...as if my opinion matters. :)"}
{"text":"The food was generally good but there was hair in two of our dishes and some of the servers were abrupt and borderline rude. However, our server Anne was polite and quickly addressed our concerns about the hair in our food."}
{"text":"A great place for Breakfast, or eating after the bar/club. They make a great Reuben and the omelettes are amazing. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Basically, My Friends is a good place to go when it's late and no one but Taco Bell is open. The breakfast is really good, and so are their salads. Don't expect more than decent food though. The servers are borderline defective (I'm a server and generally have a LOT of compassion for other servers) and in my experience have been awkward, slow on the uptake, and not very attentive. That being said, if you go in without the expectation of good service and are just there for some decent late night food, My Friends hits the spot.

PS Another plus is that they DO serve beers here, but its really expensive. My Coors Light bottles were 4.00 each!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was fine, Nothing spectacular!!
They really need to deep clean the restaurant! The carpet is old and dirty, the booths are sticky and old :/ 
They need to bring this place back to life!!"}
{"text":"Took 20 minutes for the server to even get us a glass of water. I received my food ice cold. We had to hunt down our server to even get our checks. Manager gave us dirty looks cause we didn't tip well...was she surprised?"}
{"text":"Classic American deli. Reliable friendly spot for homemade meals and dessert. Reasonably priced and great hours."}
{"text":"This along with Dianna's is where you eat pre-show or pre-bar, or late at night after you've been out boozing.  (Although you can eat in either place during the day too, as I have with senior citizen relatives of mine.)  I tend to prefer Dianna's as having the better service, slightly more extensive food offerings,and a parking lot that's easier to navigate when you're tired, but My Friends is also OK and I have just as many pals who like My Friends better than Dianna's so the two are kind of interchangeable in my mind and way better than a chain restaurant. 

In particular, if you're looking for dessert, My Friends is the one with the big, impressive dessert case full of great big fancy cakes and pies staring you in the face when you walk in.  It's really nifty-looking and has the desired effect of making me hungry for cake or pie, but if you're dieting you may want to walk real fast or go somewhere else :-) 

Service experiences we've had here range from good to awful.  One time my mom ordered some applesauce and found broken glass in it (!), apparently from some kitchen mishap.  That seems to have been an isolated incident though.  More often we have had trouble with having to ask for some menu item or condiment that was supposed to come with the food and they forgot it.  They will straighten it out for you but sometimes it takes a couple of tries.  Once you do get what you ordered, it's generally pretty good to eat. 

The location is busy and pretty safe even late at night.  I'd recommend parking in the back lot and not on the street where you run more risk of a parking ticket."}
{"text":"Someone commented that Dianna's was better than My Friends, HA.  Dianna's & My Friends are very close to one another, and through the years have had a bit of a rivalry as to which one is better.  I have to tell a story, I called Dianna's once because I was craving biscuits (this was before My Friends served biscuits) so Dianna's says, yes, they have biscuits & gravy.  So, I go and was so excited, and....the biscuits at Dianna's were pieces of toast cut into circles, covered with gravy!!!!  I asked for my money back and they would only credit half of it.  So, someone took a piece of toast, used a cookie cutter to cut a circle and called it a biscuit.  That's a good one!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this diner for a late night spot Friday evening, not too crowded, was seated and waited on promptly. Easy parking. The food arrived fast and everything was cooked perfectly. Veggie Omelette and scrambled eggs with home fries. You can tell it was all very fresh. I am happy with everything over all. Comfortable inviting atmosphere, I recommend."}
{"text":"Service is so sweet. If you go enough, some take the time to learn and remember your name- characteristic of the best diners. The food is fine and inexpensive. Its a great destination for groups craving a variety of things at all hours. Its fun, its tasty, and its near Brothers Lounge- ideal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here and I fell in love.  Breakfast 24/7, the best grilled chicken gyro (yes, I am a vegetarian but I do occasionally eat chicken) and the lemon chicken rice soup (Sat and Sun only) is worth it even in 90 degree weather!

The mac and cheese is fantastic (mostly available during Lent on Fridays) and the boyfriend loves the stuffed baked potato when it is on special.  

Nice desert selection and really nice staff.  Greek favorites as well as a really good fruit plate make this a go to for us."}
{"text":"Last resort the day manager is a real D \"bag \" typically go to this place late at night"}
{"text":"We got here at 2:44am. Got seated. And when the server is here we immediately place our order knowing that it may take time. Two groups of 4 people came later. Sat done on two different places. Other servers took their orders after ours and they already gotten their food while we are still waiting. It's been 45 mins. And no food. Last time here."}
{"text":"Got the chicken lemon rice soup ( lemon is strong). also got the turkey Cobb wrap. they put ham on my wrap instead of Turkey wow. I'm writing as I'm going through this I told the waitress and she was shocked. they said it was smoked Turkey. didn't know Turkey period was pink. ordered a Cobb salad because I'm hungry. hopefully that comes out good. Ok I'm really impressed the Cobb salad was really good."}
{"text":"Food,service, and look very good.  Four stars. By the way try the cake."}
{"text":"Great 24hr diner near Lakewood serving good simple American food. The wait staff is always nice and the don't take forever (unless you're an ass... then they might take a minute). The food always hits the spot. Amazing deserts! From breakfast to dinner, I have never had a bad meal or a bad experience. Also, a nice size parking lot in the back."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way out of town after visiting Cleveland for the weekend.  Great service, friendly staff.  I had the grilled chicken wrap and it was very very fresh.  Husband had the cheeseburger and it was hot and fresh and tasty.  Lots of dessert options and good location. Would visit again."}
{"text":"I have had nothing but good service and good food from this place in the last 10 years- food is fast and diner style. I love it.  You cant compare this place to an upscale fine dining restaurant- this is a family friendly -family restaurant that has a wonderful staff. 5 stars for being good at what they are."}
{"text":"The My Friends burger kills (in a good way!)!!
This place is always good for a quick bite or cup of coffee."}
{"text":"The food and service was really good. We found this place trying to find somewhere to eat breakfast before we left Cleveland last year.They make to most delicious oreo cake ever. We were back in Cleveland last week and we had to go back to this restaurant before we left, Will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I've always had good food and service from this place. Food quality is way better than Diana's for a place open 24/7. Try the honey dipped chicken or a panini! Mmm!"}
{"text":"How did we not find this 24/7 place sooner?? They do make you feel like friends, no matter what time of day. 

Ample parking which is a rare find around here. Strong, thick iced tea like I love. 

Good, good food. I got their breakfast late at night and was totally impressed by their eggs and I'm a picky person about eggs."}
{"text":"I want to start off by saying my server was amazing! I unfortunately don't know her name but I came here on a Saturday morning around 8am. I had my niece and nephew with me and she was asking them questions and was very friendly.  

The kids menu here is awesome. $2,99 for 2 pieces of french toast or pancakes and they are pretty hefty portions for kids and at that price! I was lucky enough to eat their leftovers. I also appreciate that our hot chocolate didn't come out so hot that we couldn't drink it. 

I will be back. It's affordable and good diner food."}
{"text":"Personally I think you can get some of the best omelettes at My Friends than 90% of the places I've eaten at. I Live in the neighborhood so I don't have to go far to experience my craving for great omelettes and that's a good thing."}
{"text":"Friends have always been a go to place after a long late night shift. The waitresses sometimes can be a little cranky. It adds the New York ambience, which I dearly miss.

The food is mostly comfort food. There's a wide variety on the menu, so everyone can find something they want. The desert case is always a temptation.  The food is so plentiful that I never have room for the deserts, though  I often take something home.

I recommend Friends for after the bars close or an evening out at the theater. It is one of the few places opened after a show at Playhouse Square.

It's a nice comfy place full of comfort food."}
{"text":"My Friends is like its own little world. Time stands still. The food is actually great, though - I've only been here between midnight and 4am, but I've never been disappointed. Always worth the drive for the French toast and hash browns."}
{"text":"If youve been out drinking then yes, this place is for you. Came here late night and had a burger and my friend had basic pancakes. Not sure how you can mess up a burger but im thinking they cooked the patty first, let it sit then did the pancakes. None of the food was tasty and our server only had 1 other table but we hardly saw her. Place overall has a greasy, grimy feel to it. No idea what other times of day are like for this place, maybe its a better experience. Also, nearly $3 for bottled 20oz soda by the register? ........what"}
{"text":"Puke all over the bathroom. Hair in my burger. Waitress was rude. Most disgusting place in greater Cleveland...."}
{"text":"24/7 food, automatically the best place in the world.  Good service, good food. Hands down awesome."}
{"text":"This is my dear father's favorite restaurant and hangout spot but I unfortunately do not share the sentiment. My Friends is--without a doubt--clean, calm, and has friendly and speedy servers; I've just never been impressed by their food. First visit: plain, tough steak. Second visit: dry, tasteless grilled tuna. Third (and most recent visit): generic, out-of-the-box mozzarella sticks and an order of the four cheese fettuccini. Though overwhelmingly rich, the pasta was good and I'd say the best of all the other food items that I've had here. I'm personally not a fan of this restaurant and will try to convince my dad to let us try out some other place."}
{"text":"Okay so I gave this place another try...not happy!  The food wasn't great enough that I was willing to ignore the horrible service.  



Nice clean environment...staff was friendly.  Decided to try the Southwestern Shrimp Wrap (wanted to be daring and bold so I didn't change the order-even ate avocado lol)  not very good.  The shrimp had a weird taste to it and I couldn't even force myself to eat it.  The smell was kind of turning me off.  I looked at the nice selection of desserts and noticed that they had Tiramisu (oooh tiramisu), it was okay.  Washed it down with a Vanilla Milkshake...it was good, not too extra extra sweet, lol I can actually taste milk (lol I hope that made sense).  So I thought the items I ordered was meh...but I will try their breakfast menu soon."}
{"text":"I stopped here after a night out. The place was half full and the inside looked clean. We were greeted and sat immediately. Food was  cooked fast, exactly what I ordered and it was good. The server was great a real sweetheart"}
{"text":"I think the best way to review this place is in context.  

Let's say it's 3 AM and you are leaving a Lakewood bar, or getting out of a late party, or just up and about and wanting pancakes.  But you know from experience and inate common sense that Denny's is sort of revolting and Perkin's is filled with old people.  So, you want some decent food, that's not too far away, in an environment as low on douchebaggery as possible.

This is a good time for My Friends.  They do the basics of 24 hr breakfast food pretty well, an OK job on some of that other crap you decide to try once and a while (sandwiches, gyros, etc.), and actually have some really tasty desserts in the case (try the rhapsody torte if you can).  I think I recall they have good potato pancakes too.

The environment is decent, the service is at least on par with their late-night competition, and there's some winners on the menu.  Compared to 24 hr chains this is your best option, but I wouldn't go here during day hours when you can have better, unless it's to stop in and get that rhapsody torte thingy."}
{"text":"The service was decent. The food was pricey $30 for two for breakfast. I didn't like the food it was average but for $30 I expect the good to be great. The food didn't taste like it was seasoned and everything had to be order al la carte, I hate menus like that because it makes the price higher."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here--I usually get an omelet (the house is very good, with spinach and feta)  and Italian wedding soup, or maybe a blueberry pancake.   If you ask nicely, they will sometimes (though not always) make your hash browns extra-crispy.  

Some of the waitresses are on the reserved side, they'll bring your food quickly but don't necessarily chitchat much.   (A little friendliness goes a long way here--our waitresses have been very kind, especially to friends with little kids.)   And I like that there's a big range of coffee drinks, as well as alcohol to have with your pancakes or pasta.  The dessert case looks uncannily similar to Aladdin's which is a good thing.

Homey, kid-friendly, and  relaxing,  and great for  late-night studying."}
{"text":"(Sun.15.Oct.2017) wife and i are in town for the weekend of (Sat.14.Oct. - Mon.16.Oct.2017) so Sunday evening we decided to have supper so we asked our hotel front desk for recommendation and the receptionist stated My Friends Deli & Resturant, so we headed there, after arriving there we was greeted with kindness and a smile, we was taken to our table where we was greeted very nicely by our waitress, we ordered our food which was cooked and prepared in the right amount of time and served to us, both our meals was very delicious, after supper we decided to purchase desert to take with us, wife had a piece of cake and i had homemade Cannoli's they both was terrific, so defiantly a resturant not to pass up, we defiantly will be returning, Thank You to all Staff for Hospitality & Delicious Food. I give this establishment 5 star."}
{"text":"Me and my friends stopped here after a reggae show.Good breakfast but they didn't serve grits!!!So only 3 stars.."}
{"text":"I had a turkey club sandwich which was OK until I felt something odd rolling around in my mouth.  It was broken off tooth picks!  I had two of them and showed the waitress and she said, \"I never order the sandwiches with tooth picks in them\".  After I showed her the second one she took the sandwich off the bill.  The tooth pick, that was holding the sandwich together, wasn't broken so I don't know where the broken tooth picks came from."}
{"text":"Makes me feel icky all over...

THE UP-SIDE:  A cheap diner open round the clock.  

THE DOWN-SIDE:  Staff that couldn't care less, food that is downright crummy.

THE SUM-IT-UP:  Never go here unless you are headed toward home after a big night of boozing it up, and need some food."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours is great! Great dessert and I love Chicken Waldorf Wrap.However the staff is weird and off standish."}
{"text":"I went here with friends in June, 2016, after a Hermit Club shindig.  It must have been around 10:30-11:00pm when we got to My Friends.  Service was very good, the place was very clean and the desserts looked very enticing but I was too full to order anything.  The noise level was very subdued--thankfully.  Some of my friends had chicken fingers (ha, they should be called planks I think as fingers on chicken is too creepy), calmari and some other appetizers.  All shared and all was gobbled up.  I would definitely come back here to eat something from their interesting and diverse menu.  This is an excellent place to people watch, both the patrons inside and the foot traffic outside, and I don't mean this in a frightening way."}
{"text":"My Friends is a frequent meal spot for me. Breakfast, lunch and dinner all delicious. Friendly service, never a wait. Ideal diner food with some yummy specials. Haven't been disappointed yet and probably won't ever be. Steak and eggs was one of my favorites for when I'm ready for a protein overload. 

Go there and make sure to get dessert. The Tiramisu heavenly. Pies and cakes to your hearts desire. 

I wouldn't go there if you are in a rush. As others have said service can be a bit slow but its a wonderful aspect when you're looking to relax for an hour or two with food and beverages."}
{"text":"Nothing special about it. Snapper had flat taste. Batter was good but it was coming off too easily leaving less taste in a bite. Chicken and pasta soup wasn't too speciak either. Overall I would say the food wasn't tasty."}
{"text":"The food is generally ok/good, but our waitress could not have been more rude. I went to work on some stuff for work with my boyfriend, we ordered dinner, and even before I was even close to being finished with my meal, she snapped \"all finished?!\" And slammed the check on the table. 
I thought I had done something to upset her, but my boyfriend agreed that she had been completely horrific since we sat down. 
Needless to say, I won't be going back. There are plenty of places open 24 hours with wifi."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late night snack. Had the breakfast Greek wrap. It was great and a great price!  Really cute place. Much roomier than it appeared from the outside. There were baked items in the case that looked amazing."}
{"text":"The Devil's Chocolate Cake...that is kind of all I need to say about this place. Cheap food that taste great. My servers have always been awesome! Especially my most recent, young girl with blonde hair and dark roots, very pretty smile. She was the light of our experience, very thoughtful and charming. Well definitely be back for late night chocolate cake."}
{"text":"Awesome deli/restaurant. Open late and they serve excellent fresh food and the staff is on point. It's a nice place to relax after an evening out and the atmosphere is comfortable. (desserts are amazing) :) You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"this place is great. I have one criteria for diners -  you have to make my eggs right. I like a soft omelet with all the veggies. this place is up to par. no overcooking, no browned spots. the home fries were brown and delicious though.
I've also had their platter of deep fried vegetables, which totally ruins the point of them being vegetables, but what amazing greasiness!
i also love their hours. where else can you go in the area that's open late night, that you won't be afraid of being shot at?!
they also have a huge assortment of cakes at the counter up front. dangerous.. very dangerous. carrot cake and turtle cheesecake are my favorites."}
{"text":"I recently had the most horrifying dining experience of my life here with a group of 9 or so of my friends. Our food all came out at vastly different times with more than 10 minutes in between when I was served and when another person in our party was served. Almost immediately after the last of our party was served and the first people in our party were finishing eating one of us noticed a giant cockroach crawling on the ceiling. I've lived in Chicago and spent lots of time in Florida, so I've seen some pretty mammoth roaches in my day. This one was by far the largest that I've ever seen in Ohio or Chicago, and was larger than many of the mammoth sized roaches that I've seen in Florida. I would estimate it to be 3.5 or so inches long and very wide. It was crawling on the ceiling above us wiggling it's antennas and being generally horrifying and disgusting. Everyone in our party immediately stopped eating and began to writhe and squirm in our seats as the roach crawled above us looking more and more like it was about to fall on to the table. We alerted the waitress to the issue who shrugged and commented that it was a big one. No one came to kill it or remove it. One member of our party began to look like she was either going to vomit or have a panic attack, so her boyfriend got on his chair and attempted to kill the roach. The roach fell and escaped. The waitress and cashier watched the entire time. No one offered to help or do much of anything. The roach escaped, probably to have a million more little roach babies in the kitchen with it's other pals. Gross. None of the staff apologized to us. Everyone was charged the full amount of their bill including the 4-5 people in our who had only just been served when the mammoth beast appeared and never even took more than one or two bites of their food. They were too nice to just walk out and not pay, so they paid for food that they didn't eat. The guy in our group who killed the roach was given a free slice of baklava to go. Oh goodie! Roach desserts for free! It was absolutely horrifying and disgusting. I will NEVER go back."}
{"text":"This is a place to go after the clubs.  Open 24/7.  If you like fried eggs, powdered mashed potatoes, Eastern European accents and gold chains, you'll love this place.  I'd recommend the open-faced turkey on wonder bread.  Ah, yes, My Friends will always have a place in my heart."}
{"text":"My friends is the end all be all to late night I need some greasy food so I can function at all tomorrow diner. It is also pretty accomadating to large groups, even if every single member of the table is intoxicated. 
The food, is well, diner food. There is one great late night waitress, the rest need a little assistance, however if I had to stay up all night serving wasted people, I am not sure how great I would be either. 
Go on Wednesday, the Tomatoe Basmati Rice soup is seriously heavenly. I gave this place four stars just because of it. They also have amazing pie and mozzarella sticks. 
But seriously, the soup. There was a point in time I made an effort to go there every Wedesday just to have it. 
They also serve wine and beer. Nothing like a cheep glass of wine and some greasy food. 
This place is the epitome of classy."}
{"text":"What a delight after a long night waitng for Amtrak!   We were greeted at the door and our waitress was attentive and personable.  Our food - a Eggs Bendict Florentine for me - was wonderful.  In spite of the early hour, we couldn't pass up Mocha Chocolate Chip Cheesecake and we're glad we did!  Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I used to strongly dislike this place because of the always-smoke-filled atmosphere.  Sitting in the non-smoking section didn't ever do you any good.

The food I thought could be quite good, although it was usually too salty.  My favorite item here on the menu is the Cobb salad, which is very odd because I don't really like Cobb salads, but it's really good here.  I've never had any genuinely bad food here, although I suspect it may depend on what you order because I know many people say it can be quite awful.

The atmosphere is decent.  It's much more cramped than the other two 24-hour diners.  It has a sort of  dark feel to it.

I have not been back to Cleveland since the smoking-ban was enacted.  Perhaps I would up this place to 4 stars?  Still...when I was going to a 24-hour place I usually preferred one of the other two places around the corner, and usually preferred Gold Coast in particular."}
{"text":"We stopping in on Sunday afternoon to test my over-the-top My Friends love. And guess what? We were not disappointed. 

I will keep my rating at 4-stars for a few reasons that are mostly really specific to me, including cheapness, swiftness, chillness, booze-ness, ample-free-parking-ness and a darn good eggs benny. Otherwise, this is just your average diner--so please don't compare this 4-star rating to anything outside of the diner-zone. 

This time it was a lot busier, but we were still seated right away. The hustle-n-bustle was a little on the annoying side, but really didn't bother our experience. The coffee was spot on and the eggs Benedict + side of perfectly crunchy bacon were also delicious, like last time. I added two mimosas to our order and the result was quite entertaining. They start by giving you a cup of juice filled to the brim, then follow that up by handing you a white wine glass and a mini bottle of unopened champagne. I'm not one to complain about serving myself a mimosa--heck--it's even great to have control over the bubbles-to-juice ratio. But I don't trust the average Joe opening champagne bottles on his/her own. And they could make it a little easier to pour the juice in the glass. But really and truly, it would have taken the server under 1 minute to make our first two drinks for us and then hand us what was left of the mini bottles. It's really a dumb thing the skimp on that's really, really annoying. 

Otherwise, this place will still remain a favorite neighborhood diner that we'll come back to over and over again."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to grab breakfast for dinner, but wanted to try a new place. This is not a restaurant you go to for new flavor combinations or innovative meals.  This is where you go to get something familiar and leave with a full belly.    The service was ok, pretty much what you'd expect. I was a bit perturbed that our bread basket had an empty butter thing in it.  It's just those little things that make you wonder if you will return in the near future.

My scrambled eggs and French toast were exactly what I expected. I did appreciate that the French toast was not burnt at all.  My husband ordered fried chicken and he ate it all so I guess it was good.  

Again, food and service were fine if you want standard American fare. But I'd probably return to another similar restaurant simply due to some service and atmospheric issues."}
{"text":"Take out from My Friends has become a food staple in my home. 
When I don't feel like cooking? My friends. 
When my husband's 11pm sweet tooth strikes? My friends. 
When it's 3am? My friends. 
When I want brunch and also want to wear sweat pants? My friends.

The food isn't fancy, but it is good. It's diner food, but not your typical greasy spoon. The menu offers quite the variety and they are open 24-hours! The interior is clean and well cared for, which I imagine is hard to do when you never close.

My go-to's are the chicken quesadilla or the Candied Walnut Salad. But more often than not, when we swing by, we are picking up a delicious piece of cake or cheesecake. Seriously. If you have been there you know it's impossible to pass by them and not take home a slice.

If you go in the evening you will probably meet Dino. He seems to be there every night. And he knows my husband's voice over the phone. You have got to love that kind of service."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours, serves breakfast all day!  That's what makes it a winner in my book.  Delicious chocolate chip pancakes, good turkey sandwich, french toast is so-so."}
{"text":"I have been twice and was not impressed with the food, but its 24 hours so its a plys when you want some  random food."}
{"text":"Pretty basic place with great hours!  I needed to kill time while my daughter was at a concert down the street.  I had a couple glasses of wine & some rice pudding.  The rice pudding was OK, but I wasn't expecting more.  I did some great people watching, no doubt!  

I am sure they have some great items on their menu.  I am sure I would return while in the area for a quick drink to sheild myself from the heat or cold that Clevelanders tend to suffer!"}
{"text":"I am usually happy with this place and often come here late at night. I haven't been here in about 3 months and since I haven't had a problem here before I figured it was a good place to go for lunch. I ordered beef tips in gravy with mushrooms and onions from their daily specials and when it came to the table it looked kind of strange. It looked like dog food to be honest. Well looks aren't everything so I decided to take a couple bites. The beef tasted gamey and must have been out of a can. It was clearly not made fresh. The noodles were mushy and the whole dish had no flavor, except for the gamey taste. The gravy was clear and gelatinous also with very little flavor. So after just two bites I sent it back and ordered something else. Now the reason for the 1 star review. I barely made it to the bathroom when I got home. I sat there wishing I would have never tasted what looked so bad when it came to the table. Probably won't be going here for awhile if ever again. So sad because I trusted this place and enjoyed the food there."}
{"text":"good service, every one was nice.. i have been going here for 3 to 4 years and i can say i love this place and is my place to bring friends to eat late out of town"}
{"text":"Way too expensive for the quality of food. Nice people working there, but the prices have gone up and quality has gone done. You'll leave feeling robbed and unsatisfied. 

George's Kitchen on Triskett Rd. is amazing! It's about 3 minutes from My Friend's Restaurant and you'll be happy you made the trip. George's Kitchen is everything My Friend's Restaurant is not. Great food, great portions and great prices. TRUST ME! George's Kitchen is the way to go. Not My Friend's Restaurant."}
{"text":"So we went to My Friends after a night of drinking downtown and let me tell you!!!!  It was exactly what my body needed.

When we got there, right away I knew this was the spot that everyone went to after a night of clubbing/drinking.  It was crowded but still very spacious.  It did not take long for us to get a table for 7 people.

Our waitress was very on top of their game!  She took our orders right away and was very helpful with explaining the menu and giving suggestions.  Our food came out quick and was delicious.

I was completely starving when we got here so I ordered 2 appetizers- potato pancakes and the hummus plate.  And both was so good!!!!!  I am still dreaming about those potato pancakes.

For my meal portion I ordered the veggie burger with fries and a side of bbq!  I highly suggest this meal!  I ate everything that was on my plate!

As we were leaving and closing our check, I noticed ALL the yummy looking deserts in the display case and HAD to order a snickers pie slice to go!  It satisfied my sweet tooth that evening.  And also, I think my eyes were way bigger than my stomach that night!  So with me getting 2 appetizers, a meal, AND desert it was less than $30.  I totally appreciated that!  And for sure will be back, hopefully when I am a little more sober."}
{"text":"Terribly overpriced. We paid $28 for two omelettes, two sides of bacon and a cup of coffee. Food was nothing special, just typical diner food. There are much better options in the immediate area."}
{"text":"I have been here several times over the last three years. Every previous experience was so-so, and I only reluctantly gave it another chance after waiting more than six months. My most recent visit (and it will be my last) was for breakfast. 

The host literally threw the menu on the table as he turned his back and walked away. The waitress seemed annoyed by my very presence even though the place was nearly empty during a late nite/early morning shift. She never even attempted a re-fill on my coffee (a must for any diner-type restaurant) until I was entirely finished with my meal, even though another table 10 feet away sat down and ordered coffee after me. She had the pot in her hand and never bothered to even ask me! Despite the absolutely atrocious service, I will say that the food was actually pretty good, although slightly over-priced: $11 for an omelette, toast and one solitary cup of coffee is a bit much. 

I will not be back."}
{"text":"If you want inexpensive, prompt, and plentiful portions of food, this is the place.  The staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is tame, even later in the evening when the drunks come in.  I usually stop here after the  bar, or the next morning for a later breakfast.  It always hits the spot.  It's not fine dining but it's not the worst food in town either... It's typical diner food.  After being out at night drinking with friends you won't care anyway."}
{"text":"Food is good, nothing extraordinary, but tasty and this restaurant wins all its points because of convenience, since it's open, cooking fresh food, 24/7. A favorite for late night, absolutely."}
{"text":"Still a solid four stars on the breakfast offerings in the Lakewood area. 

After so many years of consistently good food and service, it's definitely a regular stop anytime we visit the Cleveland area for a few days."}
{"text":"I normally come here as a last resort when everything else is closed. Today my sweet tooth was calling until I saw a dead bug (cockroach like) next to a pie."}
{"text":"I didn't have high hopes for this place. It was 10pm and I needed waffles or pancakes like a pregnant woman on a bender.

Their chocolate chip pancakes were puffy rich perfection. Their Belgian waffles were crispy and wonderful.

The atmosphere isn't new and definitely not hip. It's old school like a great breakfast joint should be.

Just typing this review I'm getting hungry for chocolate chip pancakes. Too bad I'm 1300 miles away from some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Pulled in to the parking lot and there were no spaces so our initial thought was, \"They're busy. We'll come back some other time.\" My girlfriend wanted Eggs Benedict really badly so I just parked on the street and went inside. They were packed. Despite this we were sat and had coffee and water promptly. We order a few minutes after that. I built my own omelette and she ordered the Eggs Benedict. Everything came out fast and correctly and Sharon was an EXCELLENT waitress. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Scowliest waitresses in town. I mean that in a good way. The kind who call you \"Hon\" with menthol cigarette breath while pouring your coffee. Places like this used to be a dime a dozen, but it seems they only exist now in Tom Waits songs. Do yourself a favor after your next rock show: head here for some decaf and un-fucking-believable cheesecake. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Avoid at all coast service sucks and food too i went there at 12 an and the lady server was pissed off no napkins no water  im never going back there"}
{"text":"Many a times I've ended up here with my friend after a night of being out on the west side.  The food is decent, typical diner fare but it's cheap and good.  I recommend the hummus and a side of fries.  Dip the fries in the hummus and thank me later.  It's a instant filling meal.  They'd get five stars if they had a few more vegan options.  But a long as I can order the hummus and fries I'm okay."}
{"text":"I was worried that our waitress was going to keel over on her way back with my eggs & bacon, the little old ladies that serve up your plates of alcohol sop are the counterparts of SF's Tadich Grill. All bent over & should be retired somewhere like Florida, not serving up drunks. Especially nice is when you first walk in and are bombarded with a display of pie, that kills me right there, because I am a sucker for it! Then I'm sitting in my booth, head throbbing, words on the menu seem to all formulate one word p-i-e. But then I remember it's one of those places, you don't need to read the menu \"eggs, bacon, yes, over easy, rye, yes, thanks'. Good proximity to Spitfire for late night, or morning after..."}
{"text":"I come here ALL the time.  much better than diana's down the street.  they have a wide range of pies to choose from, as well as a coffeehouse.  i never wait for seating, and the food is great.  a typical diner so dont expect a 5 star cuisine, but it is what it is.  good breakfast, and even better food after a long night of drinking.  cheap prices too!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love this place! It is literally our favorite spot! The coffee is great! The food is delicious! There's never a long wait and the staff are the kindest around! Please check it out if you're in the neighborhood. Truly awesome spot"}
{"text":"This is my go-to diner.  Unfortunately, at times, the service leaves something to be desired.  Today, I went with a friend and our waitress forgot our appetizer and gave us a bill with items missing until we went to pay and our bill was $14 more than the one she had originally delivered.  The food is good, especially for diner food and expanded menu options make it even better."}
{"text":"I stop in to this local staple all the time, sometimes at 4 in the morning after a long night of work or even during the week for a quick lunch. They are always consistent with food and service at all hours of the day. I absolutely love this little joint and would recommend to anyone. Definitely get one of their many delicious deserts to go!"}
{"text":"Had a BLT and fries; everything was perfect.  Food was six bucks!  Service was so good she got a fiver! I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice now and I can say this is a decent place to eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  They serve breakfast all day which is appealing along with their large menu of choices.  
     The first time I ate here was with some friends/coworkers right after work around 8am.  There were four of us total.  Right away I noticed that parking can be an issue because you park in the back of the building and it seemed like there were less than 20 parking spots designated for My Friends so it seems that if they are busy you might not actually find a place to park.  Then there is the street for parking but I have NEVER felt safe parking on the street especially a busy street like Detroit Avenue.  It is actually a very nice and subtle environment to eat.  Breakfast was pleasant and decently priced because all of our breakfast choices were under $10 and that's including coffee for each of us.  My Friends was a nice experience for all of us and a few of us had leftovers to take home.  
     The second time I ate here was around dinner time and it was a much different experience.  The restaurant was not too crowded (just a 4 tables were being used) and I was meeting my cousin from Columbus who I haven't seen in about 4 years.  She LOVES this place and since I had eaten here before I thought it was a great place for us to meet during the holidays as we were both busy and might not be able to meet up again anytime soon.  Right away I felt rushed by our waitress because she literally only gave us 3 minutes to look over the menu and decide.  We needed more time because looking over the menu and pages of choices while talking/catching up was quite a task actually.  She gave us what seemed like another 3 minutes but I do wish I could have looked over the menu more but I was in the mood for a gyro and that looked appealing to me.  Our food was prepared within 10 minutes but seemed so much shorter since we were talking.  I asked the waitress at this point for a menu so I could decide on what to surprise my roommate with.  She came back with a menu then gave me about 3 minutes again (like she was timing it out purposely every time for 3 minutes) and asked if I was ready!?!  I didn't like that but to save time with being interrupted again I asked if they had a liver and onion dish, which they did, and I ordered that to go with clam chowder for a very reasonable $9.99 total.  Overall, the food was good. My gyro was $8.99 for a decent size but I've had larger gyros for cheaper elsewhere and there wasn't anything that made this one stand out so it is a little more expensive than other places but the beef liver and onions with a clam chowder soup for $9.99 was a good deal for my roommate and she really liked it!  
     If the server didn't rush my cousin and I so much I would have really enjoyed this place much more and rated it higher.  The sense of being rushed took away the feeling of a relaxing dinner with my cousin while we caught up with our lives and that took away from the evening.  
     I would eat here again as the food was decent and the environment is pleasant. Next time though I would be more forceful with the servers to give me time to look over the menu and enjoy it."}
{"text":"Am I expecting too much from a restaurant that is open 24 hours? Do you lower the bar for an establishment at 1:00 in the morning? I'm torn here because I've had meals at this restaurant for the better part of 20 years. However, last night was not a good experience. I imagine if you are are a waitress working these hours, it's for a reason, and I have to respect that, but the service was weak, the waitress overwhelmed, and the establishment less than clean. 

I ordered from their \"limited\" menu, still pretty extensive, after attending a concert in downtown CLE. Most of the patrons were there after leaving the concert or nearby bars. That likely speaks for itself. The breakfast I ordered arrived on a dirty plate, with residue of someone else's meal on it. The waitress told me it'd be \"a few minutes before I have your toast.\" I tried to flag her down to tell her about the meal, but she was stressed dealing with other customers, and I asked another waitress to grab the manager. He grabbed the plate and apologized, going to the kitchen to have it remade.

Meanwhile, my wife ate her meal, then my toast arrived, after nearly five minutes! A few minutes after that my meal arrived and my wife was already done eating. The manager didn't adjust the bill at all. Instead of punishing the waitress for the gaffes, I left her a full tip, and I reminded myself I would NEVER eat a meal here again."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast. Its been a few since since I last visited. This used to be my favorite post bar closing food stop. Might be the first time I have ever been here sober and in the daylight. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. The food came to the table rather quickly and tasted great!!"}
{"text":"I have to say, having breakfast here at 5:20 in the morning on New Years was pretty damn good. I had coffee, fried calamari, and a reuben. I would go back for sure. The decor was also very welcoming."}
{"text":"Time of visit 4pm on a Friday: First off, the inside of this place is definitely not what you're going to expect when seeing it as a little hole-in-the-wall place from the outside. It's roomy and elegant for a \"diner\". Not crowded at all the whole time we were there. The place was clean and our service was friendly and efficient. 

In fairness, I have to say that I wasn't hungry at all, so I ordered a generic appetizer. I'm not going to bother to grade the restaurant on that aspect. My dining companion had the Waldorf Wrap, which was grilled chicken, cranberries, almonds, lettuce and ranch dressing. For the purposes of a Yelp review, I had to sample it and it was pretty tasty. The cranberries added a welcome hit of sweetness to what would otherwise have been pretty bland. What I liked too is that there wasn't a boatload of ranch on the wrap as I've had at some other places. 

The menu wasn't overwhelming but offered some pretty appealing choices. This place is open 24/7 and serves breakfast around the clock. For me, prices were reasonable yet leaning toward the \"is it worth it for the portion\" end of the scale.  Overall, I would return again when I'm hungry enough to try something more than cheese sticks and a soda."}
{"text":"The last two times I have been here, all of my friends got their food and finished eating before what I ordered was even cooked. I usually like to just come in here for the atmosphere late night after a couple of drinks. I will probably just drink a Coca-Cola next time and avoid the food. I end up just boxing it up and eating it all alone in my kitchen late at night. That is pretty depressing."}
{"text":"Never thought to review this place, because it was everyone's late night greasy spoon-stomach settler. Who hasn't been here and who doesn't know what it's like? But it has been coming through in the clutch when i have had certain cravings, so it merited the shout out. It has far outgrown it's old diner image to become a hip, consistently reliable urban eatery. We had Thanksgiving here last year. Eggs and pancakes. It was great.

Tonight i drove home from the barren lands of Lake county craving fish. Well everything is pretty much closed by 8. That includes Arthur Treachers and other drive thru fare. But then i remembered the old ace up my sleeve! The place that makes most anything anytime for real cheap. I got perch with fries, slaw, apple sauce and a slice of Oreo cheesecake for around 14 bucks. In about ten minutes. Fish was a little \"Erie\", but otherwise a good portion. 

There was a student just hanging out doing homework, a few other take out people who popped in and folks sitting outside of Now That's Class. On a Sunday night!  That is the lively urban progressive Cudell/ Lakewood that i so love. Now go to Crocker Park at 8 on a Sunday....crickets...."}
{"text":"I will always and forever love My Friends' potato pancakes like they were my own child. I don't have a child, but if I did, I think I would love them as much as the potato pancakes. Unfussy food, cooked well, 10-star potato pancakes, enough desserts to send you into sugar shock, food coffee, solid any time of day or night. And I guess potato pancakes."}
{"text":"Good food but our waitress was SO rude. My friend raved about this place so I knew I had to check it out. 

Unfortunately, I will never come back. our server was so rude that it ruined the experience. Not only did she slam food on the table and make rude comments about us to the table next to us, she rushed us to leave by demanding for us to sign the check as soon as she set it down. 

Made me very uncomfortable so if anything, maybe I'll just get my food to go."}
{"text":"My daughter and I like to stop here after the movies. Food is always good. Quick and friendly service and it's clean. The decorations are a bit odd with a Greek feel but like it's trying to be fancier but the food is just right."}
{"text":"The food was alright. Service was really good. I think we tipped 30%. I probably wouldn't come back, however."}
