{"text":"YES YES YES! We ordered takeout but stayed and waited for our food. While we waited, we ordered some cocktails at the bar. The mule was average but the whiskey apple sidecar was delicious. We quickly got our food and were extremely impressed! Pizza, gnocchi and the antipasti salad. I don't recall the hostess's name but she rocked! Great service, great food and a great atmosphere (bocce ball connected)!!! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We went to Dante's Inferno Saturday night around 6:30. The place wasn't crowded but a great atmosphere. Our sever Brandon greeted us immediately, was very knowledgeable about the beer and food selections & everything was delivered in a timely manner. Brandon checked in on us the perfect amount. He also recommended our appetizer of pepperoni rolls which was delicious and we enjoyed the Spaghetti & Meatball pizza. It's seriously so good. Lastly, we had a great view from a high top bar table.j"}
{"text":"I've been to Dantes a few times now and always had a good experience. Really enjoyed the Bocca and other games. The pizza was great and I really enjoyed the olive app. I would have to say the best part about Dantes is the service, I sat at the bar my last two visits and the bartender Raffee remember my name from previously coming in which was refreshing and made me feel welcome. I think the other bartenders name was lauren and she was very down to earth, she even introduced me to a new favorite drink which was great!  Go to Dantes if you're looking to play games and have great service."}
{"text":"If they could just turn the outdoor music off at 1 am, that would be great. There is no one outside because it is too cold. Speakers are too loud. It's a restaurant, not a club."}
{"text":"I loved this place. We went a Week night and no one was there except us. I loved the pizza I got (meat pizza and the goat cheese (I think) one) and our friends got an app they loved as well. Everything came out hot and fresh. We did not play the bocce game but would love to come back to play!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gawd. The pizza is amazing. The 10\" is enough for a guy or teenage boy. We were family of 4 and we ordered 3 pizzas. I had one slice of cheese, one slice of pepperoni and one slice of the Inferno since my husband and teenagers each ordered one. The service was great. The jalape√±o margarita was so good and strong. The beer was cold. It was packed because of game 7 of the Eastern Conference NBA Finals since the Cavs were playing the Celtics. Such a great vibe in the Flats area. We stayed across the way in Aloft so a very easy walk. Get yourself there!"}
{"text":"We love their pizza! With so many great options in Cle, there is so fierce competition, but this place always impresses us with their creativity. Most recently, we tried the pistachio, honey variety and it was divine! Such a weird, memorable series of flavors. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Hmmm. The service was very good, the ambiance was great for the summer with a nice patio complete with bocce ball court and a glassed wall that folds in to provide an airy interior; and the food was up to the standards you'd expect from a Dante restaurant.

But when we went there last Sunday we still came away shrugging our shoulders, unenthused. And I think it was because of the menu.

We wanted to take advantage of the unseasonably warm September weather so I figured we could sit on the patio and have a light pizza or maybe a summery pasta like spaghetti aglio e oilio. But the menu, while showing a pride in unique, modern takes on the classics, also tended toward the heavy side. The poster child for this would be the spaghetti and meatballs pizza (which could be great in the winter but we were lounging in the setting sun and 90-degree temps).

We first went with the breaded calamari appetizer which was spectacular -- the breading was light, the squid tender and the dipping sauce had just the right amount of heat.

As for drinks (yes, they arrived after the appetizer as we unfortunately sat down right before a shift change), I had a great Hemingway Daquiri, which usually is very tart but this one was more subtle. Jeannene has a glass of a crisp white wine.

As for the main course I went with the seafood pizza. The actual pizza was very thin and light (the server suggested because of that that we each order our own) but then there was the white cream sauce, cheese, tomatoes, greens and of course a heaping pile of shrimp, calamari, clams and anchovies. It also comes with olives, which I passed on. The pizza crust was nice and chewy but everything else wasn't anything special.

Jeannene went with a pizza full of cheese and honey with crumbled pistachios on top. It looked very pretty and if it had some meat in it I might have been tempted to try it. She liked it but also was not blown away by it.

We'll probably be back, maybe in the winter when comfort food is called for, though we won't be able to take advantage of the nice patio."}
{"text":"The spaghetti and meatball pizza is the best!! I like coming here for lunch because of the reasonably priced pick-2 style lunch menu. Also a great spot in the summer because of their bad-ass patio and bocce courts"}
{"text":"If you're in the flats area you really must stop in- at least for an app and a cocktail. The bar area is casual and fun and the drinks are fantastic. Our bartender, Damon , was sweet, professional, and very attentive without over doing it. He recommended the pepperoni rolls as an appetizer and we were not disappointed- really delicious! We spend a lot of time downtown and in the  flats and will definitely be back for dinner.
Did I mention they have bocce ball? How fun is that?"}
{"text":"The manager- Chris. May be the rudest person I've ever seen. I watched him tell 2 ladies and a gentleman that they had to leave bc the bar was closing early. They told him they were the bartenders ride and he told them they can wait out in the car and then began yelling at the bartender that she didn't have to work there if she didn't like it. For someone that works in customer service- I feel like he needs to work on his hospitality and manners. There was no reason for him to treat those kids like that..."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Excellent staff. Great location. Had the spaghetti and meatball pizza and it was perfection. So much flavor. Very good prices as well. 5 out of 5 for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on their opening day. Beautiful place, large dining area and large bar. They also have games in the back as well as two bocce ball courts. If you can't make it inside they also have a pickup window.The menu is full of classic Italian dishes with a few twists. 

Warning this is not your typical Dante restaurant. Most of the menu items here are supplied from their purveyors with ready made sauces and par baked pizza crusts. So we started with some appetizers, we had the pepperoni rolls which had great flavor, they had a nice char on the bottom, the cheese to pepperoni ratio was nice. Next was the Nonnas meatballs. Again another great dish. The meatballs had good flavor and texture. And finally the Dum Yum Wings. OMG! These were amazing. They had a great breading and the sweet and savory seasoning was outstanding. Then we ordered a few pizza's starting with spaghetti & Meatball Pizza. Now the crust on this pizza and all the rest for us was bland and under cooked. Again keep in mind they do not make the dough in-house.  The topping were dry and over cooked and not much flavor. Next pizza was the vegiterranean. It had great toppings and the sauce had great flavor. Also had the bianco pizza, the only thing you could taste was sweetness, it was to much for us. Also tried the hotdog & French fries pizza. For kids this would be great. For us the combination just didn't work. And the last pizza was the seaside. Amazing! It had a load of seafood and the sauce really complimented the whole thing. Then we went in to the pasta course. Ordering the potato gnocchi gratin. The gnocchi was nice and tender, but the sauce was super oily and we could not eat it. Also tried the baked vegetable lasagna. The pasta was cooked nice and the sauce was flavorful, the only down side is we did not like that the veggies were raw. Last but not least dessert. Sicilian cannoli was fantastic. Nutella calzone was really great love the mix of nutella and banana, great combo and really messy. Finally the show stopping chocolate strawberry tiramisu. On the menu it said for two, it could feed six it was that huge. Wonderful combination with the strawberry and the soft ladyfingers, topped with chocolate covered strawberries. Would definitely get this again. Overall great experience, staff is great, atmospher great, the food was underwhelming."}
{"text":"I want to say that the staff here is amazing. From the cooks to the servers ( who only had one day of training) and bartenders considering the poor management (see below reviews) the place is really cool. Patio is amazing."}
{"text":"Dante's Inferno in the \"Flats\" section of Cleveland is a great!!!  We stopped here briefly as we were touring this area which is dotted with dozens of great eating and drinking establishments!  It was our last stop of the night and it was unforgettable.  Our experience was entirely at the bar since we already had dinner nearby.  The place was packed but we managed to find one seat!  Immediately we were greeted by Sequoia the best bartender in Cleveland!!!  She went out of her way to prepare an Irish Coffee for my husband since it is his favorite after dinner drink and it was not on the Menu. I had my usual Cognac and espresso which was competently prepared and served.  The ambiance, atmosphere and the service in the restaurant was incredible!  We felt kind of regretful that we had not chosen Dante for dinner once we observed the delightful plates being carried to other patrons!!!  Never less,  it surely will become a must stop next time we are in town!!!"}
{"text":"First time trying Dante's Inferno and highly recommend it.  Had the Inferno and my partner had the Paradise.  Bartender Raffee gave us great service.   Design is nice with a variety of seating options, all offering great views of the Flats and the river.  Bocce courts are nicely done and regulation size too."}
{"text":"Checked out this new spot and it was impressive! The space is huge and we had no problem getting seating for a large group. The bar area is spacious and they have a separate area with high tops for drinks and games. The DJ on Saturday night played great music and the vibe was upbeat and fun. Our group tried a variety of options from the menu and everyone was very pleased with their meals. I like how they have the half pasta options.  It was the perfect amount of food to fill me up but not be uncomfortably full or have to carry left overs with me the remainder of the night. The prices were cheaper than most other places in the flats, which was a nice bonus. I will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Had the paradise pizza and a glass of Pinot Grigio. Great for date night. Delicious pizza!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service. Fast and friendly waitress. People watching from patio was the best. View was amazing. Very comfortable. Drink was delicious and prices were fair"}
{"text":"First, the service is 5 stars. It's the food that needs improvement. We tried 2 pizza's and the crusts were so soggy! Plenty of toppings which was nice - you get what you pay for, but unfortunately, the pizzas were so soggy we couldn't eat more than 1 piece each of the pizza.

The Nonni's meatballs were okay. I wouldn't pay $8 for 3 golf size balls with no cheese on top. We ordered because they were a mix of pork and beef, not just all beef. They totally lacked flavor.

I hope this place can improve as it's so convenient for us living downtown! And the customer service is awesome. However, a good restaurant has to have both so hopefully, food will improve."}
{"text":"The concept is great. The execution is poor bordering on shockingly poor. The restaurant was empty on a Thursday with 80 degree weather, which is in part reflective of a broader flats problem but also indicative of a subpar delivery of what could be a fantastic product. Bad service which is somewhat understandable as they figure out how to staff on weekdays vs weekends. But a good attitude goes a long way in compensating for structurally impaired service - that was nonexistent.  Drinks took 15 mins. Asking to order our food was met with 10-15 minutes of too busy to take it. Food took 40 mins...keep in mind the Restaurant was bordering on empty. Dante would not approve of the finished product that showed up on the table. I had the chicken parm - which was destined to fail as it was way too thick and undercooked as a result. Ultimately, the Flats is a tough puzzle to figure out. So not entirely their fault, but the experience was dilutive to the Dante brand. The 2 out of 5 is reflective of a combination of poor service in an empty restaurant coupled with a product that came up well short of my expectations and likely Dante's vision for it. Not a lost cause / just needs some attention."}
{"text":"Reviewing service only.  Did not eat here. 

We walked in to this restaurant-which was absolutely dead-on June 16.  A female waitress looked at us when we walked in; we said something to her indicating our interest in being seated and she rolled her eyes and walked away. Will not come back if this is the type of service you receive here. 

This is a shame because this restaurant is almost always empty when I come to the flats. I assume this is part of the problem."}
{"text":"The place is located in the flats right across Alley Cat. Inside space is huge with a bar figured prominently in the center and TVs sprinkled throughout. Never eaten at a Dante's restaurant before so came on opening day without much expectation.

I took a seat on the patio. Service was friendly,   albeit a bit delayed given working through kinks on first day (still putting cushions on seats when I arrived). Menu consists mainly of pizzas and pastas. Decent cocktail list, but was a little disappointed with craft beer selection as they only have a few great lakes and thirsty dog. 

I got the half order of Devils pasta ($9). Great serving size for lunch at a reasonable price in otherwise pricey flats. Nothing extraordinary, but pasta was tasty with a good amount of shrimp included. 

I will be back to try a pizza esp once Thirsty Dog opens next door. Good casual addition in the Flats."}
{"text":"Wow, what a disappointment! There was absolutely nothing special about this pizza at all. The crust had no flavor and the toppings we're bland. I ordered some pepperoni rolls as well they also had no flavor and I don't even know if there was pepperoni in them. The pizzas were pretty small and $14 each, I don't mind paying a little extra for good food but that's not what we got. We also had pretty poor service. The place was empty yet out waitress only came to check on us a few times. I got up to go to the bathroom and saw her sitting at the bar chatting with her friend. There's plenty of good pizza places in Cleveland, skip this one.

We also thought it was funny  that they made a point of saying (a few times)  you couldn't add any toppings to the pizzas because the \"chef\" didn't want people changing his recipes. Chef, lol. Chef Boyardee maybe.

I had originally given just 1 star but I changed it to 2 because the place did have some cool games and would be a fun place to have some beers. Just eat at Beerhead or something before you come."}
{"text":"The potato gnocchi is amazing, a bit small for the full at $16. The beer selection is good on draft. We had the spaghetti and meatball 10\" and it was enough for two people.  We bought two pizzas and had enough to bring one home. The people watching is fun too as people walk by. Worth going to. We enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Came in. Service was slow. Pizza was ok.
Also I saw  that the GM at this location left racist comments on Facebook. He referred to a Muslim as a \"camel\". Shameful establishment. But like I said. Pizza was ok"}
{"text":"Not entirely sure if this review is for the bocce, the food, or the bar, but I'm a fan of this place nonetheless! (No one seems to know who actually owns the bocce) The bocce courts are a fun/different thing to do in the Flats other than just stand around the bars. The pizzas here are not the norm, but they are delicious. A bit small though; good to split one for two people, but don't expect too much more or be sure to order some extras. Finally, they have a decent bar with a good mix of brews, friendly bartenders, but it can be slow sometimes. Overall I recommend giving this place a try whether it's for food, bocce, or just a drink!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever! It took 20 min to bring us water.Don't ever bother to go there. The rudest waiter i have ver seen. They even charge me more than my check was , so be careful always check it before paying."}
{"text":"Tonight we visited Dante's for dinner.  The place was half empty and on no wait (score considering every other one next to it was on an hour wait).  We grab a nice table by the open windows and quickly order drinks.  Drinks arrive in a reasonable amount of time.  No complaints there.  Shortly after receiving  the drinks we place our order for appetizer and meal.  This is where it starts to take a turn....

As time passes, and passes, and passes, no appetizer.  More time passes, and I start to notice people that arrived after us now had their appetizer (happened to be the exact thing I ordered)...

I flag down my waitress and ask if I will be getting my appetizer before my meal.  She says she isn't sure it may come out with my meal.  Huh?  You heard that right.

Again the waiting continues, we are now at 35+ min and yet no appetizer.  The waitress again swings by and now apologizes for the delay.  Keep in mind the restaurant was half empty when we arrived.

I am now starting to notice tables that had been seated well after I ordered my food are now getting their food and I still have 0 appetizer.

Finally we see our waitress bringing our food...well kind of.

She sets down the appetizer and everyone's dinner...except mine.  It will be another 20+ min before I see my dinner.  The waitress said she thinks they lost my order....

Now when it comes to food quality, once I finally got my food...mehh at best.  5/10.  Not great, not bad, just ehh, nothing special.

The long and short of this trip?  Took over an hour to get our food, ate in shifts since everyone was finished when mine arrived, and the food was ehh just OK and the waitress didn't even so much as offer to discount anything.

In a nutshell, I'll never visit this place again.  Tonight I saw how they operate with a low volume crowd, can't imagine what would happen when they are packed."}
{"text":"Went there a few weeks after they opened with my parents. I ordered the Dante's Inferno, dad ordered the Spaghetti + meatball pizza, and mom ordered the goat cheese one. I tried all three of them and regretted my choice -- while the dante's inferno was good, the other two were much better!

The service was outstanding. I don't recall our waitresses name but she was very attentive and gave great recommendations to us. My one complaint is that the bocce ball court was a bit to close to some of the outdoor tables. I got nearly belted by a few bocce balls once or twice while eating. Otherwise though, this is a great addition to the flats."}
{"text":"Just horrible. We went in and there was no one greeting customers but they weren't even busy. Server, although friendly enough, was forgetful. We had 2 kids with us and the kids meal prices are outrageous and inconsistent depending on what you get. All kids meals were $8. One child got an entire adult size pepperoni pizza for that price. The other got a spoon of spaghetti noodles and 1 small meatball. Pizzas AND appetizer of pepperoni rolls were RAW but due to the fact that our server was so forgetful and inattentive, we didn't even bother bringing it up. Total for the bill for 2 kids meals, an appetizer, and 1 pizza was over $50 not including tip. Never again."}
{"text":"Was hoping for more from a Pizza place. No wood fire or coal fire like LA. And $21 for chicken parmesan being 1 pounded out chicken breast and a cup of spaghetti way overpriced. $10 for a Titos and soda. Not one thing that was something to tell a friend about. Except to try another place"}
{"text":"Where to start. There was failure literally at every point of service. 

Our server started the evening by asking if we had been in before. When we said no, he said he wouldn't give us the usual welcome speech because he had a busy day, but to ask questions if we had them. 

The drinks took forever to come out. When they did, the Moscow Mule was watered down and the Monte Carlo tasted like pure bourbon. 

Then there was the food. The meatball appetizer was good, but nothing to write home about. 

We initially ordered the Sausage, Peppers & Rigatoni pizza. A while later the server came and said that it and the Inferno pizza were 86'd because they ran out of sausage. We ordered the Italian Meats pizza (that has sausage on it) as a replacement. A bit later a runner brought out the......Sausage, Peppers & Rigatoni pizza..... Once we had finished that our server brought out the Italian Meats Pizza. Total. Utter. Confusion. 

As for the tastes, the flavors on the Sausage, Peppers & Rigatoni pizza were good. I think. It was hard to tell as while the crust was good and warm, the toppings were cold. There were even strands of unmelted cheese on the pizza. The roasted peppers did have a good flavor.  

As for the Italian Meats pizza it was served at a better temperature. It was piled with that sausage they ran out of plus prosciutto and other meats. 

We also got a half of the Baked Vegetable Lasagna. It was served in a neat lidded bowl, and was fine, but again nothing to write home about.  

Overall, slow service and a complete breakdown of communication. The food was also a big let down for Dante. This was a very disappointing experience as I really love all of Dante's other locations."}
{"text":"Prompt seating for a busy Saturday night. Our waiter was slow to greet but eventually showed up. Rushed our drink order. We had to wave him back to order our appetizer, pepperoni rolls.
He returned with drinks and we placed our order. Moscow Mule was pretty good.
Waiter returned 15 or so minutes later promised food was on its way out.
10 minutes later our drinks were gone flagged waiter again and asked where appetizer was, waiter said he would check. Minutes later our dishes arrived, never received appetizer. The waiter was very apologetic but blamed \"system\" he offered to remove from bill and/or box to go. Im not interested at this point.
Chicken parmigiana dish was good, crisp and fresh, however it comes with a small portion of pasta.
Waited again awhile for our check while a manager removed the appetizer from our bill. Would have felt better if the manager had acknowledged our bad experience, no one ever checked with us. Food was good but the service was a fail.
1-2-3-4-5! staff greeted us at the front as we exited and told us goodnight. Too late. Where were these people when I needed my appetizer?"}
{"text":"The food is phenomenal- especially at this price point. Quality ingredients! In-house made meatballs are delicious. Two of us shared the antipasti salad & there was plenty! If you like fried calamari, order it because it is excellent. Each pizza easily serves 2-3 people, but we ordered one pizza per person & took home leftovers. The Strawberry Chocolate Tiramisu for Two is huge - easily feeds 4! This is NOT your typical pizza place - so much better!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this place especially since it was a Dante establishment.  The pizza was mediocre at best.  I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pros: Great food, wonderful view, nice patio with bocce next door.

Cons: All of the food is average. Just average. And expect to pay more because you're in the Flats."}
