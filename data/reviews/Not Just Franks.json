{"text":"I want to like this place, I really do, but :  They don't serve Sundrop or Cheerwine  They serve food service factory slaw,that is weak  The chili is OK, nothing special  They don't understand the proper order for dressing a dog: mustard,then slaw,then,onions,then chili . They put the chili under the slaw....which messes up the hot/ cold condiment relationship.  These people seem very nice, and the pretzels are really good, but the hot dogs need work,I've actually had better hotdogs at locally owned gas stations.  The saving grace,their prices are actually too low. I would gladly pay $2.50 for a better hotdog, even $3.00  What a burger ,one block away,has award winning hot dogs,with home made slaw, homemade chili,better tasting blended meat  Frank.   Service is excellent, ambiance is awesome, tables, set up, perfect."}
{"text":"Sometimea, all you want for lunch is a freakin' hit dog.  This place delivers.  The franks come however you want them, it's affordable, the staff are friendly, and the freshly squeezed lemon/orangeade is a treat.  If I had to nitpick, I do wish their chips had more variety - they only have a very few kinds, and I kinda wish they had Sun Chips or sour cream n' onion or something...  It's just a nitpick thoigh."}
{"text":"Hot Dogs & Pretzels.  The Hot Dogs are delicious.  The Pretzels are fantastic and fresh.  You can watch them making the pretzels, which is cool for the kids (I enjoy it too haha).  Orangeade is a must.  Quick service and very friendly staff.  Inexpensive.  Definitely worth the trip here."}
{"text":"best food in town!!!! Love franks hotdogs and pretzels!! Love the garlic Parmesan pretzel!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the service and the food. My only complaint is that it is called, \"Not Just Franks\"- but it only has hotdogs and pretzels. Otherwise the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Best soft made to order pretzels around!! My family and I are not hotdog fans but we absolutely LOVE stopping by for a fresh pretzel (my family's favorite is the cinnamon and sugar).  The workers always greet you with a warm smile and are very friendly.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are in the downtown Concord area for lunch- they are located right in front of the courthouse.  Such a great place filled with great people! *They are only open for lunch (11-3)"}
{"text":"Support locals and try this gem out! Great people serving very good dogs! I love feeling of being welcomed in the second I open the door. Feels like home! O and do not leave unless you try the Orangeaide!!! Great job!"}
{"text":"Customer service is fantastic and the food is great. I loved coming to this place with my kids. I got a chili cheese frank and a cinnamon sugar pretzel. The pretzels are made fresh everyday and the workers are so friendly. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this place and thought we would grab a quick bite. Great pretzels and they have great homemade chili. And it is not expensive at all. We don't live in Concord but we have already decided we will make the trip from Mooresville to eat there again. Thanks for a great lunch."}
{"text":"So good! Quick and easy and super nice. The hotdogs were great and their pretzels, oh my gosh yummy!"}
{"text":"What a great hot dog dining experience!  We happened to be Downtown Concord and saw Hot Dogs in the window so we decided to pop in and give it a try.   My husband and I have been devoted hot dog diners since our first date when we had hot dogs in the park.     The place is simple and clean. They gave us wonderful service. It took me a minute to weigh all the options and then decided on all the way, light on the onion. Which was done to perfection. In my experience most people don't understand light on the onion. The buns were warm and soft.  They were not soggy at all. The dogs were boiled and had a good texture, soft but not mushy.  They make all their own sauces and the slaw and chili in house.   the ATW was good so we decided to try one more. Tried the German and a Franks Favorite.  The German had sauerkraut and mustard and Franks Favorite had NY Onions and mustard. I had never heard of NY onions, it was onion in a spicy and sweet sauce. It made my tongue tingle, in a good way!  But I like spicy foods.   Then the very nice hot dog man, who I suspect is Frank, gave us one more to try.  We were too full at the moment so we took it with us for later. It is the Deputy Dog and I'm looking forward to trying it...BBQ sauce, jalapeños...should be good!  $2/dog. Total including tax.   They also make fresh pretzels.  We did not try them as I said before we were stuffed with dogs!  And I would also like to add that the bathroom was functioning and clean.   The only thing that I don't like is they are too far from home to go on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"We love Not Just Franks.  Great spot to grab a hot dog and pretzel in downtown Concord.  Owners are always friendly and go above and beyond.  Even offered to bring our pretzel to our table after we finished our hot dogs so we could have it hot!  Food is always hot and fresh.  Entire restaurant is very clean and nicely decorated.  Perfect spot to take the kids for lunch. They love the cinnamon pretzels, but ALL the flavors are really good."}
{"text":"I get that a lot of people dig this place and yes it has its upsides, but I was less than impressed by the quality of the dogs. Not 100% sure what type of dog they use but pretty sure its not a beef frank, soft texture it lacks the spice or bite of a great quality beef frank.  Typically when refer to a dog as a \"frank\" you are talking beef, a \"wiener\" on the other hand is comprised of a meat blend.    I had the Chicago dog and 2 all the way Carolina style dogs. The Chicago dog just did not cut it against a traditional Chicago style hot dog, jalapenos instead of sport peppers, no celery salt, it was OK but I would not order again.  The Carolina dog was better but the toppings were sparse, maybe a tablespoon of chili and slaw.  Also heard great things abut the fresh squeezed orange and lemonades, they were pretty good.  Maybe they should be called \"Not Just Wieners\".  Food: 2.5 Sporks Service: 4 Sporks Atmosphere: 3 Sporks Sweet Tea: 3 Sporks Value: 4 Sporks"}
{"text":"Small shop on the lower end of Union Street across from the Old Court House. Very spartan but very functional. They turn out great dogs at a great price.  You can get three dogs with your choice of topping (cheese extra) for $5.00 Make it a combo for a $7.15 which includes a drink and bag of chips.  I had three dogs, with ketchup, mustard, onions and chili and they were perfect and made for a great lunch.  The part that is not Dogs is Pretzels. They have an interesting way of increasing sales and promoting good will. For a dollar, you can buy a pretzel for the next customer that comes in."}
{"text":"Not just Franks is very near and dear to my heart. Located in the heart of downtown Concord, this location not only serves up some of the best hot dogs around, but they have a hot pretzel that melts in your mouth. For those that have a urge for a hot pretzel either amply garnished in salt, or other toppings such as cinnamon sugar, this is the place to come while experiencing the historic Center of Concord living. They also have a feature that is unique to them call paying it forward, which is patrons donating hot pretzels to those who otherwise can't afford it. Hats off to not just Franks, and I'll continue to be a willing contributed to your paying it forward program."}
{"text":"I don't even like hot dogs, and I love Not Just Franks! They really have some magic they put in their food. Everything I have tried there is absolutely delicious.  Not Just Franks is conveniently located on Union Street in Concord, right across the street from the Cabarrus County Courthouse. It is a quick lunch, without being \"fast food.\" It is easy to pop in for a yummy snack while shopping downtown (or if you're me, window shopping).   Not Just Franks offers Not Just hotdogs, but pretzels too! There are different types of pretzels...the most important being cinnamon and sugar. When enjoyed warm with buttercream frosting (50¢ extra) I challenge you to find a more delectable dessert in the Concord area. It's finger-lickin' good!  And don't overlook the beverages! Not Just Franks offers fresh squeezed lemonade and orangeade, made with real sugar. Just the thirst-quencher for a hot summer day.  Not Just Franks is really a community establishment. The owner has a \"Pay It Forward\" program where people can pay a little extra and leave a sticky note for someone. If there is a day you don't have enough, you can pick a sticky note and still get your favorite snack. Make sure you try out Not Just Franks; you will enjoy it!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite on the run. Awesome, awesome awesome pretzels! Hot dogs, sodas. Friendly staff and spotless restaurant. They do have shorter hours but definitely worth checking out!  Also have some nice meal specials. I do miss them being in the mall. But the new location is awesome."}
{"text":"Yes, they have more than franks but that's all I need to let you know this place is amazing! They're fast, efficient, and can get you in and out the door in a hurry. Since this is a spot I mostly frequently during my lunch hour, the efficiency is something that I really need.   My favorite thing to eat is the special of 3 hot dogs for $5. They have your traditional hot dog combinations but they also have some creative, original ideas as well.   They really do their best to get people taken care of quickly as they are right across the street from the county courthouse. Plus there are plenty of competitors in the area that people could go to instead.  If you're looking for a good dog, you've got to check out Not Just Franks!"}
{"text":"If you're feeling a good, juicy, plump, delicious hot dog I don't recommend coming here! The only reason we stopped by was because our initial choice restaurant was closed so we decided to wing it. The place is a quick, grab your lunch and go type of place and the prices are very cheap. The hotdogs are boring and bland, with cold buns. Their pretzels are just as bad. Skip it."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. Quaint, Friendly, Clean and Delicious Food!! Im telling you now the customer service was So Great I thought I was being Pranked!  The hot dogs were Great tasting, The Buns were extra soft and the Homemade chili and slaw was UNDENIABLE Amazing! Now lets talk about the Pretzels. I had the Sugar and cinnamon pretzel and HOMEMADE buttercream icing for dipping. It was Sooooo Good I bit my finger while eating it! Im Soooo Happy and satisfied I plan on getting another parking ticket just to have a reason to come to Concord and stop by for a repeat meal!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Not Just Franks last weekend for the first time. The name is truly very fitting as these hot dogs are much more than your average hot dog. I cannot determine if it was merely my being unbelievably hungry or the flavor, but it was one of the best hot dogs I have ever tasted.  But the hot dogs are not even the best part about this small spot located conveniently in downtown concord. The homemade pretzels here are definitely good enough to write home about. With a variety of flavors and toppings to choose from, you truly cannot go wrong with a pretzel.   The restaurant itself is not very big and was pretty busy for a Saturday afternoon, a good sign for customers. I would highly recommend stopping in for a pretzel or staying for a hot dog! The staff here are excellent and take the time to make you feel welcome."}
{"text":"This place is not great.  They are fast and friendly; but their food is lacking.  The hotdogs are nothing special, the buns are basic, and the chili was weak.  Nice people, nice location, but very weak food."}
{"text":"They only do 2 things, Hot dogs & Pretzels. They do both very well. I had a chili dog and a pretzel and both were delicious.   What caught my eye was a \"pay it forward\" sign on the door giving the customer an option of paying it forward to another customer who might be in need. I tried to walk in but it was a few minutes after closing time and the door was locked. Someone rushed to the door to let me in. They were very friendly and the place was immaculate even at the end of their business day.  Even the follow customers were friendly... This was all in addition to having a really tasty chili dog. If you are in Downtown Concord between 11:00 and 3:00 Monday thru Saturday, definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick easy lunch! The hotdogs are the best in the area. The fokes are eager to take care of your needs Thanks to all at Franks!"}
{"text":"This place is not fancy. It's just a hot dog diner.  The food is good. The dogs and the pretzels are awesome.  They also have hand-squeezed lemonade and orangeade.  The employees are nice and speedy. The cleanliness of the restaurant is apparent as soon as you walk in. The health department issued sanitation grade is posted behind the register- a grade of 100.0!"}
{"text":"When I finished my case in court yesterday, I popped in here for two \"all the way\" dogs with mustard, chili, Slaw and onions.  I have been eating NC diner hot dogs fixed like this for 50 years now, and I feel that I have some expertise on the subject.  I thought these were pretty good.  I will come back for more next chance I get.  And remember- ketchup does not belong on a Carolina hot dog....."}
{"text":"Not Just Franks is a fantastic spot in downtown Concord for a quick lunch or snack. The menu consists of two things that they do very well: hot dogs and pretzels. I enjoy watching them hand-roll the pretzels right behind the counter. The dining area is simple and functional, yet charming. There are no frills at Not Just Franks, and the prices can't be beat! Go at lunch time during the week because they keep pretty short hours."}
{"text":"If you're looking for quick, clean and friendly place to eat a hot dog (or multiple) stop in here at Not Just Franks. It's not fancy, it's not noisy and hot dogs are great. The homemade chili is very good if you're so inclined to have it on your dog.  They have several pre configured options available for you to try or create your own combination from the varied toppings. The owner brought me a pretzel fresh from the oven to try and it was delicious...and I'm not a typical pretzel kinda guy.   Prices are reasonable to even low compared to most places nearby. In summary, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good hot dogs for the price you pay. Great value with the combos they offer. Try both the hot dogs and pretzels."}
{"text":"The pretzels are to die for---seriously!  I love the cheese dip with them too! Yummm!"}
{"text":"This place is nothing too over the top special, but were my dogs delicious? YES. I love the idea for a simple business, especially if you're craving a good hot dog. I got the Chicago style and Sweet Carolina. Now I'm from Illinois and while I'm not an expert, it definitely wasn't a true Chicago style dog. However, it was good nonetheless. The Sweet Carolina dog was an interesting combination, but I loved it and would definitely eat it again! Overall cheap date place and the service was extremely friendly!"}
{"text":"We love bringing the kids down on Saturdays for hot dogs. Everyone is very nice the place is kept very clean.The food is simple and tasty.  My only critique is the name is just a bit misleading. \"Not Just Franks\" is in reality, just franks.  Yes, I realize they do have pretzels, but really that's it. It's my favorite oxymoron dining experience.  It's great place and we'll be back, often."}
{"text":"Not Just Franks is a hidden Gem in Concord NC!  The hot and fresh pretzels come in a variety of flavors (cinnamon-sugar is my favorite) and the original is yummy too, these pretzels are dripping with buttery goodness and just the right amount of salt (watch out Auntie Annies, they give you a run for the money)! And the all beef franks with your choice of toppings are simply mouthwatering!   The lines were out the door with people getting not just Franks but combos so they can have the best of both worlds!   The only issue I had with NJF is they are kind of stingy with the napkins, if you don't ask for napkins you won't get any, so be sure to ask or you'll be wiping your buttery fingers on the bag (like me) or your clothes!   This was my first trip here but it certainly won't be my last!"}
