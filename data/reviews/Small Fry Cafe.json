{"text":"You haven't lived until you've tried Smallfrys fish and chips! In a seaside town full to bursting with fish and chip shops this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. Being down a back street it is a hidden treasure and will sadly be missed by many tourists. Smallfrys has a take away and a small cafe area. In the take away the food is cooked fresh to order so the quality is always high but you are not kept waiting for long. They don't have an extensive range of fancy fish like many places do but they don't need to, the cod and haddock is so delicious you couldn't want any more. They have a nice range of meals for children and do sausages etc, for those who don't like fish, The food is very good value for money, a lot cheaper than all it's local competitors. You will not be disappointed by a visit to Smallfry/"}
{"text":"The only place or should that be plaice... that sells chips cooked in vegetable oil. Do you know how many chippys we tried before we finally found this little box of delight? The answer would be pretty much every other chippy in town. *Go into chippy* 'Do you use dripping? We'd get told yes. And we'd move on. No matter that google & numerous websites say that chippys did veggie chips. They'd be out of date or straight out liars So when they said yes they use vegetable oil & I bit down on the lovingly prepared butty, I may have had a mouth & taste orgasm! They lovingly craft the butty. Making sure you put the salt & vinegar in the right places. That it's slightly squashed so that the chips won't fall out. They care out their buttys... Wunderbar!"}
