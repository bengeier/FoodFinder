{"text":"I really love this place because it's so cheap but so good. The shrimp wontons are so big and fresh. One thing I really love about the wontons is that fact that the shrimps they use are very clean and do not have black \"vein\" in them. (I'm usually not a picky eater but I don't trust anyone or any place that leaves it in.) They're also seasoned simply but are very flavourful. I tried both the egg and the rice noodles and they were both great but I prefer the egg noodles because they're more al dente. The broth is light so you can customize it with the chilly oil and vinegar. I really like their chilly oil because they make it themselves and it's fragrant. A little goes a long way. I got take out the last time and it took less than 5 minutes for them to package everything up for you. Very good food and service."}
{"text":"Extremely fast service - great if you're in a hurry with colleagues.  As other posters have noted - amazing shrimp wontons, homemade hot sauce, etc.  One thing I was surprised with was the fish balls.  I tried half of one that my friend shared, and I liked it.  And I usually despise fish balls, beef balls, and anything like that.  Also, we didn't notice this right away, but there is a tea station so you can quickly grab your own tea.  Given the prices / speed it seems like a very practical arrangement.  Prices = excellent Food = great Service = lightning quick, very friendly and kind staff, and the right level of service for the type of food (people who want a quick bowl of soup)  The food and prices earned the 4 star, the service got my 5th star.  Well done. Bought some of the hot sauce on the way out, seemed to have a great flavor at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Best won ton noodle joint around. Won tons slightly larger than golf balls. Consistently fresh and gotta try them with the great chilly oil."}
{"text":"I was extremely excited to know that they expanded near me. So I went and had a delicious bowl of egg noodle shrimp wonton!  The soup is very tasty and the size of the Shrimp wontons are big and stuffed with Shrimp and not a lot of fillers like other wonton places. The spicy sauce on the table is very good in moderation as it can be very spicy for certain people. A very Hong Kong style place with very affordable bowls of wonton that can satisfy you, especially if you are looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"When I went to this Jim Chai Kee it was pretty quiet, besides my mother and I, there was only one table and someone waiting for take out. Their decor and overall appearance is lovely. It's a small restaurant but it looks really nice.  The menu is small, not too many choices but it would only mean that the food would be great... right? :) Well It wasn't too bad but because we ordered \"extra noodles\" they sorta just clumped it into the bowl. They didn't seem to have a bigger bowl to make it at least appear to have soup... I wasn't impressed with the general texture of the noodles... usually wonton noodles are a little chewy and not just melt in your mouth when you take your first bite. Their broth was amazing which I thought was  a shame since they didn't seem to have added any more broth into my bowl even though I ordered extra noodles. Oh, tea and hot water is self serve  in a station near the back, go get it yourself.  Overall it wasn't too bad, I've honestly have had better and perhaps won't consider this location for Wonton Noodles."}
{"text":"It's 3.5  We had:  Wonton Noodle in soup ($5): Big wontons, lots of shrimp, good soup base, good noodles. Rating: 4/5  Three Combination(Wonton, Beef, Fish Ball) Rice Noodles in soup ($7): Fish ball is huge, beef is of lower quality, Rice noodle was okay Rating 3/5   Service is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Finally!  A tasty wonton noodle restaurant.   The place is clean and the staff are friendly.  But most importantly,  the food is delicious and authentic.   The prices are extremely cheap as well.  For a bowl of wonton noodles it was only $4.50 - that's less than a McDonald combo.    This is truly a tasty and authentic Hong Kong wonton noodle restaurant.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The staff and food quality is so much better than the east beaver creek store. The people here are actually polite !! They also don't stop doing business at 7:30 and turn always customers when they actually close at 8:00  Glad to be able to have good food and polite staff !"}
{"text":"To me, very comparable to Wonton Chai, except location. My husband noted that the fish balls here are bigger and more authentic so that might be be the only diff. So, it's a substitute for Wonton Chai."}
{"text":"Jim Chai Kee is my favorite noodle joint.  I frequent their Richmond Hill branch and enjoy cheap but extremely satisfying wonton noodles.  This branch was closer to a friend's house so we d coded to check it out.  The noodles were the same quality and value as the original branch.  The interior was newer and nicer.  Service was just as speedy and no soup nazi here :)  If you're in the Neighbourhood, try it and see why you should go here for cheap eats."}
{"text":"Service: - self-serve hot water/hot tea like their other location - does not have cold water  Food: - nice big shrimp wontons!! - sometimes little parts of the skin in the shrimp is in the wonton - noodles is a hit or a miss: sometimes not fully cooked and other times is perfect  Overall: - nice, ambient place to eat with not more than 3 people as it can feel crowded and claustrophobic  - usually pay at the front after finishing your meal  - expect them to tell you to give them tips and they will take your change and expect that it will be the tips!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY! CASH ONLY! CASH ONLY! $$$$  Great spot. Clean, fast service, friendly waitresses, and delicious wonton noodle soup. I ordered the house specialty which came with beef, fish cake, and shrimp wontons. It was tasty, however next time I will stick with the shrimp wontons.   5/5. Will return for sure!"}
{"text":"As montrealers, here is the first and only restaurant we would visit every time we travel to Toronto. well known for jumbo sized wonton stuffed with shrimps and minced pork, it usually takes less than a minute to finish reading the menu and then make our decision on our order. Choices on the menu are limited to the specialty -- Wonton, beef, fish cakes,  served only in broth or with egg noodle / rice ho fan noodle.  Highly recommended the fish cakes,  it's made of real fish with very little starch incorporated. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Love this place - really hits the spot when youre craving a hot comforting bowl of won ton noodle soup. The place is clean and has ample parking. The won tons had ample shrimp, the fish balls were excellent and finally the beef was soft and silky. However the soup doesn't really taste like shrimp, more so like chicken broth."}
{"text":"I was craving for some yummy Chinese comfort food this past weekend so we popped by a hidden gem in Agincourt, Scarborough. Jim Chai Kee Wonton may be familiar to some of you who have visited their original location in Richmond Hill. Their main items on the menu is - you guessed it, Wontons! Mind you these are not your grandma's wontons. These wontons are on steroids and are bigger than the size of golf balls! They are made fresh daily and served with the perfect combination of fresh thin noodles and hot flavourful broth. We also ordered a side of green \"Choi Sum\" vegetables with oyster sauce that was only $2.50. What a steal!  Tea and water is self served at the back of the restaurant. The restaurant was very clean and organized. The food arrived very quickly and we were in and out of the restaurant in 30 minutes. The only criticism to this restaurant is that their hours of operation are 10am-8pm, however they close their kitchen and lock their doors by 7:30pm which is a shame considering that it is peak dinner time. There were 8 customers that were turned away at the door during the last half hour before closing. You're in luck if you arrive before 7:30. At a very affordable and reasonable price of just a mere $6, this is the place to go for a delicious, quick, and cheap meal!"}
{"text":"Signature Noodle - Wonton, Beef & Fishball with the choice of soup noodle or rice noodles ($7 + tax). Great taste on the noodles and works really well together. The beef was a tiny bit raw which was fine. The wontons here are really good, loaded with shrimps, full of flavour and quite juicy. Definitely recommend! Great for a quick meal. Very traditional simple soup noodle place, very authentic as well. Comes with 2 pieces of wonton, 2 pieces of fish paste, and 2 pieces of meat. Affordable and filling for lunch/dinner.  Service was really fast, food literally came in 5 minutes. There might be a slight language barrier as they're mostly Cantonese speaking restaurant. Well lit and has plenty of sitting room, quite the family friendly store."}
{"text":"New location, same old menu, traditional Hong Kong style wonton noodle soup. I used to be loyal customer at the Richmond Hill location. Good choice for fast and comfort food. They are not just fadt, they are lightning fast!"}
{"text":"Great fast in-and-out wonton spot in Scarborough.  The shrimp in the wonton is fresh cooked perfectly and has a nice crunch to each bite.  The egg noddles are bouncy not too soft.  The broth is clean and balanced, not oily or too salty.  Food comes in a matter of minutes and the tea is self serve.  If you're looking for a hearty, warm but relatively light meal on the fly, may I recommend Jim Chai Kee."}
{"text":"Awesome place for wontons! I always get the wontons alone without noodles so I can enjoy pure shrimpy goodness lol.  Their wontons are massive and come filled with alot of shrimp (not weird flour-y filler like some wontons I've eaten)."}
{"text":"I have never been to a restaurant that doesn't serve you cold water. If you were really dehydrated you have to buy bottle water or get hot water/hot tea. There were 3 waitresses more or less standing around and they couldn't even get us some tap water.  Food was fine, wonton soup is still good as usual. Hot sauce is good and spicy, which also aggravated me when I had no water.  I would come again if I needed something quick as the food will come within 2 -3 minutes, but I have a hard time supporting businesses who deprive you of basic necessities."}
{"text":"delicious! for only 4.50 before tax I got the wonton noodle soup. there's lots of shrimp in your wontons and you get 4 of those, they are REALLY big too. the amount of noodles is really filling. not soggy at all it is chewy. you can even add 1.50 for extra noodles if you want. fast and friendly service. a grest place to drop by and have a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Food 4.0/5 (50% of final grade) I had the everything noodle, and dare I say.. YUMMY! The wontons are so big! The fish paste was also bouncy and delectable. According to my mom, who requires much of a culinary experience for compliments, the noodles were reminiscent of those she ate back home in Guangzhou, and the fish paste was authentic -- just high quality fish and seasoning. The bowl was perfectly sized, despite it looking a bit on the small side, once finished it was actually the perfect proportion. The noodles tasted fresh (no aftertaste of the fridge here!)  Ambiance 2.5/5 (15% of final grade) There wasn't much to say about the ambience -- it didn't look shabby enough for it to be considered \"authentic\" looking (as in Hong Kong or Guangzhou the yummy places are usually shabby due to age). On the other hand, it wasn't well-kept enough for any additional comments. Hygiene was good, no sticky tables, everything was more or less in order, but not much to compliment about.  Service 2/5 (15% of final grade) Nothing notable about the service-- they take your order and leave you alone. You have to get the tea yourself though -- it's hidden behind a corner. It doesn't make sense to me what they were trying to pull with having people get their own tea. Makes no sense.  Cost 2.5/5 (10% of final grade) Averages about $7.50 per bowl before tax. Not a big bowl of noodles, but was quite yummy, so it was worth it. Not a hats-off-to-you type of price though.  Brownie Points 3/5 (10% of final grade) Brownie points from mom -- my mom rarely compliments these types of shops. A sign of approval from mom is the best sign there could be at a restaurant.   Final Grade = 64.5/100 = 3 Stars from mom!   TLDR:  Swing by when you're in the area! Best for lunch, because the place closes pretty early. Come with two or three pals (because eating alone is so sad), but the facilities are not meant for a big group -- it's a small place."}
{"text":"My experience at the restaurant in chronological order: 1) Walk into the restaurant and was asked to sit at a table 2) Ordered and got up to get tea. 3) Walked back to my table and my order was there. (Literally 30 seconds after I ordered) 4) Finished eating in 5 minutes, paid, and walked out.  Word of Warning: The XO chili sauce is VERY hot so don't add too much or your mouth will literally be on fire.  This place is even faster than a fast food chain. I was impressed with the speed and the noodles were on par with the soup. Never disappoints."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  I come here at least twice a month with the GF.  I always get the \"lo mein\", B5 I believe, shrimp wonton with the beef.  Food always comes out lightening fast and blazing hot.  Portions are great!   I know this is street food but it really hits the spot in terms of flavour, quantity and quality.  Wontons are pretty packed and handmade, beef is super soft (they probably use baking soda or something to tenderize it) and the noodles are always in a heap.    It's always packed here during busy hours but the turnover is under 30 mins per table."}
{"text":"Five stars!    U can't get this quality downtown; nowhere close!  And my goodness... the value...  $4.50 for a bowl of noodles and 4 big wontons.  SO GOOD!!!  I've always known about the HWY 7 location but rarely make it that far north.  When I found out they opened up shop south of Steeles, I knew I had to pass up on Ho Ho BBQ for some shrimpy goodness.    The service is fast.  I think it took about two and a half minutes from ordering to bringing the food to the table.  My husband and I each ordered a bowl of wonton noodle soup and we shared a plate of greens.  Delicious, simple, no frills.  Plenty of firm shrimp in the wontons.  No fillers. I hate that feeling of biting into mush when you're eating wontons.  The noodles...  I love wonton noodles but these ones are extra thin and have that amazing firmness/bite with each chew.  Even after sitting in the hot broth they don't get overcooked?  A miracle!  The greens were blanched so nothing fancy but you want to feel healthy so eat some greens!   Just a little tip:  If you like spicy, their hot chili oil is like burn-your-mouth off spicy (and I love spicy!).  Start small and add if needed.  I went big to start and felt the burn BIG TIME.  You can buy mason jars of the hot sauce too for all you mason jar and/or spicy fans!    Next time I'm in the area, I'm going all out!  Wonton noodles AND BBQ...  Oh yes..."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Wonton (Cantonese Shrimp Dumplings) stop. I usually come here to buy their raw dumpling 12 pc at $14. Price has gone up. Their original store first started in RH. So missing the hungry feeling and satisfying after eating their giant wontons.    Food Quality Great, shrimps always exquisite and fresh  Service....fast and adequate . A new way to experience shrimps flavours. They also make fish paste and marinated beef with your choice of noodle.   I highly recommend to pick up their raw items and cook your own way at home. You can eat in store.  See what you like ;)"}
{"text":"Pretty much like all the other Won Ton Chai restaurants with their self-seating policy and self-serve tea stations.  Had the Wonton noodle soup and vegetables with a dollop of oyster sauce.  Four large Wontons made with fresh shrimp and no fillers.  Typical fast service that they're known for especially when they work in \"anticipation mode\" during the lunch hour.  The soup was delicious and tasty although I still find Wonton Time in Market Village tastier.  I didn't experience the claims of it being MSG laden at all.  A perfect meal for a cold winter's day."}
{"text":"This place has fast service, yummy noodles, and delicious broth. Everything meal on the menu under $10 and food comes quick. Great for a quick, fast bite. Don't expect anything spectacular in terms of service, but it's good for what you pay for :)"}
{"text":"Great bang for your buck + cash only!   As I was slurping my bowl of won ton noodle, I asked my boyfriend what he thinks. What follows was silence, only more slurping sounds. That's when you know you are having a good time in your mouth.   The won ton is out of this world, they do not skimp out on the shrimps. The fish ball is also very good. Beef is unlike usual western style or pho style beef. Would recommend getting the bowl of all three to try.  Tips: egg noodle, vermicelli, and ho fan all interchangeable with the price. The broth does change though depending on your choice of noodle."}
{"text":"I can only comment on the actual wonton and their take out experience.  Whenever my family and I are craving some good wonton we tend to buy a dozen fresh ones from here and cook them ourselves. No joke.. these wonton are huge! Size of a teenagers closed fist haha. Filled with lots and lots of shrimp and you would be satisfied with two or three!  A little salty.. but quite delicious. The price did however go up from a couple years.. it is now 12$per dozen.. and I believe cash only.   Restaurant itself is small and turn over for table is quite fast."}
{"text":"I had to update my review from my original 3 stars down to one (it would have been zero if that was a possibility). The original post is seen below the break in page.  I was never enamored by this location, but I always want to give the chef a couple of chances, as they could of had a bad day at the racetrack the day before. This time was by far the worse experience ever! I shall never return to this location, and will tolerate the extra distance, and go the extra mile to the Hwy. 7 location.  I followed up as usual after my wonton noodles with a plain bowl of noodles. The noodles lack life. It was made in water that just wasn't madly boiling. Rather than complain, I sucked it up. I proceeded to order a second bowl of plain noodles, and this was an absolute disaster. I couldn't withhold my tongue any longer, and complained to the server. I suggested that the water to cook the noodles was not boiling madly, and the noodles had a doughy texture - not the \"crunch\" that it should have.   What happened next threw me off - completely! They recooked the noodles! They recooked the noodles I spat out into the bowl in the same hot water they use for the other guests! OMG - really! I couldn't tolerate this longer, and really made a big stink; they gave me another bowl of noodles, it wasn't much better, but wasn't horrible.  I shall never return to this location for the lack of hygiene and their poor quality.  ***********************************************************   The Hwy 7 location has better food quality. The quality comes down to the technique of the chef as the materials used are identical. The location is newer, and and looks more modern. Unfortunately I'm swayed by food quality, its preparation and final outcome. Decor and other exterior fluff is for others who prefer atmosphere over food.  Final thoughts. No cigar compared to how the noodles have been mastered in Hong Kong."}
{"text":"Second time having their signature wonton noodle. Actually the first time was at their older Hwy 7 location.  This shrimp wonton noodle is still the best ones in town, and best deal, IMO.  4 giant golf ball size wontons filled with nothing but succulent shrimps, served alongside with wonton noodles cooked to the right firmness. At 4.50, the deal is excellent. I hope they don't raise the price :)  Go easy on the hot sauce on the table. Good, but powerful stuff. A few small drops was enough for me.  Place is new, clean and cozy with some booth seats. Service is quick and friendly. Took only a minute for food to get to your table after placing the order. Server tone was nice and said thank you and goodbye when we left.  Self-serve tea at the back corner and you must pay by walking up to the cashier with your order ticket (server told another customer that when they try asked for the bill).  One thing that's different from the older location, maybe these servers are new to working with each other, they weren't crazy loud with non-stop chatter across the room, and they didn't yell their orders into the kitchen. Actually the restaurant was too quiet when the didn't turn the TV on :) But I prefer that over the constant yelling over my head at the older location.  Shop is next to Pizza Hut, across from Rona.  This location is so much more convenient to me anyways so I definitely look forward to coming back again."}
{"text":"Time to update my review of this place. The service is still maintained at high level of speed and accuracy. My family and I came today during a busy Sunday lunch time. We were seated quickly and placed our order not too long after. In about 5 to 7 minutes, the server returned with our orders.   Onto the food, my dad and I ordered the fishball and wonton lo mein. While my mom ordered the fishball soup noodle. Soup was fresh with no added MSG. That's a plus. Noodles were tender. Both the fishballs and wontons werehuge and had just the right amount of taste.   If you want quick service and pretty decent food, this place is highly recommended. And not to mention the cost wasn't excessive."}
{"text":"The service was really good. The food came out fast. I asked for a box and they gave me one but also asked if I wanted a bag, so attentive! The wontons are almost the size of your fist, and their shrimp wontons only have shrimp in case you don't / can't eat meat. They have the option to have to wonton noodles or just get the soup with the wonton if you're trying to cut down on carbs or if you're just not that hungry. The only downside was the price. It was $8 for a bowl of wonton soup and wonton or for a bowl of wonton noodles with soup and wonton. But the size of the wontons make up for it!"}
{"text":"The food is mediocre. We had the signature wonton And noodle bowl. It came with a couple slices of beef and fish balls too. Not the biggest bowl but the wontons were huge which is nice. Only downside is that all the food was bland. The broth wasn't rich or flavorful, the wontons, meat and meatballs needed seasoning too. The side of greens we ordered were mostly stems, no leaves either. The only thing I would say was good was the service. The ladies were nice and friendly and the food arrived at our table within 5 minutes."}
{"text":"It was my first time here and the food was awesome! The signature wonton noodle soup contains 4 big wontons filled with shrimps, great thin noodles and tasty soup and it was only $4.50 which was totally worth it. The service was great and FAST; from the time I ordered to when the food came on the table it was less than 4mins! Great place to go when you're really hungry!! They have 2 machines at the back for you to fill your water or tea and you would have to go to the front and pay after you eat. Over all this place is awesome and I will definitely came back again with my friends and family. :)"}
{"text":"I have a disclaimer to make. I'm not the biggest fan of wonton noodles. As a Chinese person, dishonor on my cow? Something like that. That being said, I don't order wonton noodles all that often. When I do, I like to eat them in the restaurant and I like to drown the whole thing in red vinegar and chili oil. However, we go takeout, so red vinegar wasn't an option. Chili oil, however, abounded. As wonton noodles go, this one was pretty good. The shrimp wontons had a nice springiness to them, and there were a decent number of wontons in my noodles. I was really impressed at how thin the wonton noodles were. I don't recall having wonton noodles this thin before. It was surprising, but not unpleasant. I may have put a little too much chili oil in, but the chili oil was delicious.  Will I be back? Not intentionally, but I won't say no if someone wants to take me."}
{"text":"Limited menu but good enough. For protein they only have sliced beef, fish paste and wonton. Noodles they only have egg noodle, rice noodle and flat rice noodle. Less means easier to choose. You can order veggies on the side. If you like spicy definitely try their hot oil. Beware only take a little at a time because it is extremely spicy. Overall everything was pretty good but I would like a little more selection."}
{"text":"Best value in town.  $5 for a bowl of wonton noodle.  $6 for wonton and beef noodle.  Food comes to your table in 2 min.  Get your own tea.  Place was busy on weekend morning at 11am.  Efficient service. Get the chili oil for $8 to take home.  so spicy all you need is a few drops."}
{"text":"Every time I crave wonton noodles soup, I have to come here because they make the best one! Their wontons are very big, juicy, and filled with many ingredients. Their noodles are very chewy which I enjoy for the type of noodles that are paired with wonton.   You are able to purchase frozen wontons from the store if you like and they also make their own XO sauce (chilli sauce). Their chilli sauce is VERY spicy so if are can only handle a limited amount of spice like myself, do not put any in your dish. I only put a little in mine and it overpowered my noodles so much that I had to rinse it with water because it was that spicy!"}
{"text":"An awesome wonton shop located in the McNicoll and Midland plaza. This location is known for it's delicious. The reviews for this place really speaks to themselves. Came here with my sister and we decided to get the signature bowl which is $8 each and comes with a bit of everything such as the wontons, beef and fishballs. We also got the veggie plate with soy sauce. Always a must in my opinion here. They also have Lo Mein and Soup with toppings. For water and tea, there's a self-serve station. The wonton noodle soup is delicious as always just like how I remember it. I've always had a very good experience here. Definitely the best wonton noodle soups around. It's cool that they make their chili oil sauce in house. They sell them in mason jars too. Make sure you bring cash as they only accept cash. No cards. Staff here are friendly and they are super attentive to your needs. Overall, always love coming here because it tastes great and the prices are very reasonable. Highly recommend if you love wonton noodle soup!"}
{"text":"I have been missing out!!! Can't believe it took me so long to try HK style wonton noodles! Two ladies were making wontons when we arrived. I got all three toppings: fish balls, beef, and wonton. I would have to say I was not a huge fan of their beef nor fish balls. BUT those wontons and noodles were so good. It was like having a bowl of comfort. Not only the food is good, but the price is so cheap! The place is very clean and modern too because this is a newer location.   Overall, excellent food, quick service, and very good price. It won't be too long until I am back here again. Next time I will just stick to wonton as my only topping for the noodles."}
{"text":"This spot could ride solely based on price alone.... how can you go wrong with a amazing broth, wonderful noodles, and wontons stuffed full with shrimp for just $4.50, and it's not like its a tiny taster bowl, could be a legit meal (if you weren't a man of my immense appetite). It was great! Love being shown places like this!"}
{"text":"their famous wontons did not disappoint  each one had plenty of shrimp & a very thin skin   but the taste of MSG was overpowering should have used chicken broth as the base instead"}
{"text":"was deeeelicious. Big shrimp wontons and lovely moist flavourful fish balls, beautiful egg noodles fast as a whip, friendly attentive service. I'm ready to go back for dinner.  I'm full but not over full, perfect portion size and help yourself tea station"}
{"text":"Love the al dante egg noodles. The texture was comparable to the noodles I've had in HK. Simple and affordable meal in Toronto :)"}
{"text":"Goods: Fast service, food comes within 10mins of ordering. Simple menu, only a few toppings to choose from. You serve your own tea thus you don't have to wait to get refills. Food portions are good, very filling for a medium size person. Prices are reasonable, for what you pay and the amount of food. You pay at the cashier with your bill whenever you are ready thus you can get in and out fast.  Bads: There is too much MSG in the soup, you will get super thirsty afterwards."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my mother -- we hadn't been to a Jim Chai Kee in more than a decade.  The shrimp wontons are just as big as I remember!  The vegetable plate could be a bit better (in terms of amount of veggies they give you).  Overall, not too bad, but prices have sure gone up.  It's pretty small inside but I guess most people just eat and leave quickly as with most fast noodle places."}
{"text":"So...found out that my fave noodle bar in Toronto, Jim Chai Kee, has a location on Midland as I was Yelping trying to find some good Noodles in the area.   This place serves the exactly same food as their other location on West Beaver Creek. So what that tells me is that they have their receipts down to a science.   Same, fantastic food and service.   Broth is perfect. Right amounts of salt and other delicious flavour, which as the owner explains is a secret family recipe. I've bugged her many times for it but she won't give it to me.   Wontons are huge, flavourful and perfect.   Price: $5 will get you an very generous portion of 4 wontons, noodles and broth. If you want to go vegetarian, it'll cost you a whopping $3.   This location is less busy than the HWY 7 location and is definitely more modern.   As a side note, their hot sauce is the best I've ever tried. It takes dried chillies in oil to a whole new level.   Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"They have authentic Wonton aka Hong Kong style shrimp dumplings. Probably best I have in Toronto.   I ordered Signature Lo Mein which has wonton, beef and fish ball in egg noodle and tossed in Hoisin sauce ($8).  The wonton is huge, and tastes very shrimpy. Beef was ok, not too much flavour. Fish ball was great too. Next time I would probably order only wonton."}
{"text":"I went to Jim Chai Kee for the first time yesterday and was really impressed.We got takeout and were handed our piping hot containers of soup within literally 30 seconds.    I ordered the shrimp wonton and fish ball soup and it was really tasty. My partner had the noodle soup with shrimp wonton, beef, and fish ball. The shrimp wontons were delicious, packed with tons of shrimp. I wasn't the biggest fan of the fish balls, but that might be a personal preference (I'd never had them before.) The woman at the cash offered me a small container of the house hot sauce to try with my soup and it was really tasty as well. (I love heat!)  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area. It was super affordable on top of being really tasty and hearty food."}
{"text":"I love the soup noodles at JCK Richmond Hill (RH).  I can't help but compare the RH location to this location.    Food: Great consistency on the quality of wontons and fish balls between the two locations.  The wontons and fish balls were delicious and large in size.  There were 2 shrimps in each wonton.  Both wonton and fish paste can be bought raw for home use, and both are worthy of so.  The soup broth here tasted richer than the RH location's during my visit.  Services:  Same outstanding efficiency, effectiveness, and matter-of-fact as the RH location.  It took longer for us to get the tea (self serve) than for the food to arrive at the table.  I found the people at RH location friendlier.  Interior Decoration:  The Scarborough location has better ambiance than the RH location, hands down.  The RH location is a no frill type of place.  The restaurant and the restrooms were clean during my visit.  Good food, low price, sonic speed services.  What not to love?"}
{"text":"Wonton noodle soup is just on par here. Chopped up fish meat had fish bones which sucked.   For a place that specialized in wonton noodles, this place is just average."}
{"text":"I absolutely love coming here if I'm in need of a quick bite. The service is incredibly fast, you can be in and out of here in under half hour (earlier, if you're a fast eater). Important to note that the drinks (hot water/tea) here are self-serve, so don't expect the waiters to bring it to you. They're available at the back counter.   The wontons at this restaurant is what you're after (though, I haven't had any misses with any of the other items on the menu). The wontons are easily twice or three times bigger than the ones you normally get elsewhere, and they're just amazing to eat -- full of shrimp, no weird fillers.   They also have a couple of different noodles and will make your combination without complain (you can have wontons with vermicelli if you'd like or the standard wonton noodles). Be aware, though, of the chili oil. You don't need a lot for the kick you're looking for. I would highly recommend that you start with very little (less than a spoon), and work your way up.   They also have a variety of their items on sale. Wontons can be bought at $12 for the dozen ($6.25 for half dozen). Chili oil is $8 a jar. (Both worth buying, in my opinion)"}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, good food.  Ordered wonton noodle and within 2 minutes our food was ready. The wontons are really big with huge chunks of shrimp inside. Also got a sliced beef noodle soup and it had a pretty decent amount of beef.   Just like David L. said already. The XO chili sauce is a bit on the hot side but taste really good. Made my lips all red it was so hot....lol  Nice and clean for a Chinese fast food restaurant and it even has two large HDTV's streaming Chinese programing."}
{"text":"Jim Chai Kee is my go-to wonton noodle place. While this location was okay, I prefer the one on West Beaver Creek. This location seems to be recently renovated, and thus looks sleeker, but the food from the store on West Beaver Creek is incomparable. The soup is more flavourful and the wontons are larger. Regardless, this Jim Chai Kee is a great option in the area!"}
{"text":"The noodles are a hit and miss but this is the best value of a quick meal there is!  Their obviously known for their wontons and of course they are homemade and delicious! You can buy them frozen as well, $6.25 for half a dozen.  I love this place. If only their noodles were as consistent as their wontons. Sometimes theyre too soft and sometimes not yet fully cooked.   Their hot sauce is so good too!"}
{"text":"Great food. Consistent flavours.  Fast food. Service sucked.  Came here for a late lunch and asked for iced water.  This place is self serve tea so cold water is from the tap.  The wait staff rolls her eyes when we asked for iced water and she told us to get it from the tap.  Been in the service industry for 10 yrs. Never rolled my eyes at a customer.  Sorry to the kitchen for this review but service to me is just as important."}
{"text":"The service here is surprisingly good. Extremely polite and attentive, not something you'd see in a noodle shop - not something you would expect anyways. I was here at 12:30 pm on a Saturday which is peak time and my noodles arrived within 2 minutes. So fast!   The wontons here is really good. Large fresh shrimp wrapped in a thin wonton skin. Not really a fan of their fish balls as its kinda slimy for me. It doesn't taste bad, just a really slimy texture.   Unfortunately the soup is loaded with MSG and my throat was extremely dry after eating just one bowl of noodles. Which is a shame because I remember their soup being really tasty a few years back."}
{"text":"This really is a good place for Chinese comfort food.  Shrimps are very fresh here, and for that alone, they get 5 stars.  Wonton wrappers very silky.  Gai-lan and choi-sum tasted a bit saltier today.  This is a no nonsense, bang for your buck place.  I like."}
{"text":"We come here often for the beef ho fun  yummy with some chilli oil! Nice clean place  and the tables aren't too crowded like some places"}
{"text":"Big won ton and nice noodle place!  Portion is a bit small, might need to add extra noodles!"}
{"text":"Finally a competitive Korean food establishment. With ever growing food choices in that area I think they will survive. It's great that they opened up a new place but it seems to be always busy and servers are always trying not to assist you."}
{"text":"Not too much seating at this place.  It didn't matter for me today as I went after the  peak lunch period.   I ordered the signature noodles with wonton, fishballs and beef for $8 plus tax. It was brought out to me instantly.  Initially the bowl looked a little small.  However, I quickly realized there were two huge shrimp wontons and two large fishballs under all the noodles. There was also a decent amount of beef.  The fishballs were good, as was the soft, tender beef. But what I enjoyed most were the shrimp wontons!  They were so yummy! I could've eaten five of those.  After finishing my signature noodles, I felt full.   Overall, I enjoyed this dining experience and look forward to returning again."}
{"text":"I have not eaten a better shrimp wonton elsewhere. Vegetables, beef, fishballs and the noodle were good. Service is friendly and very quick. Restaurant is clean."}
{"text":"]:  I've only been here once before & I thought I'd be back many times... but, when I returned (a couple months later = today) it was sorely disappointing.  The noodles tasted .. chemically.  The noodles were a little undercooked, the soup bland, and the wontons were a turn-off after the soup and noodles.  I had to douse my noodles in (pink) vinegar before I could eat anything.  I'm still a little nauseous half an hour later.  Sorry, can't be/won't be back."}
{"text":"$6+tax for a bowl of wonton and beef noodles. the bowl is medium sized and you can choose your noodles, i prefer thick rice noodles. i am not a fan of spicy but my friends like this spicy sauce over other shops. wontons are very good quality and soup is very light. $6 is a pretty good bargain and you will probably finish every last drop. would come again for sure."}
{"text":"One of the better wonton noodle soup places around the area. Very fast service and the soup always comes out amazingly hot and savoury every time.  Their wontons are also extremely big and filled with large shrimp pieces, well worth the money (@$6 per bowl)."}
{"text":"Jim Chai Kee just opened up a new location in Scarborough.  I always been going to their Richmond Hill location so I am glad that they open up another location.   There are only 3 items to pick from Wonton, Fresh Sliced Beef or Homemade fish balls. And if you don't want to make a decision, just have them all in one bowl!  My usual Wonton and Sliced Beef in Rice Noodle Soup ($5) and a side order of vegetable ($2.50) was as good as I remember.  Service is fast and efficient.  Self Serve Tea and Cash only."}
{"text":"Had to try it after seeing it listed at one of Toronto's best Wonton Noodle joints.  It did not disappoint.  The wontons were huge and fluffy with great flavour.   The staff was friendly and service was great.  You help yourself to the the tea and water so it has a really casual and comfortable feel.  Would definitely recommend if you are craving a solid bowl of noodles."}
{"text":"im pretty happy with the wonton noodle soup here.  the wontons were huge.. noodles were done right.. and chili oil was actually spicy.  add 2.50 for some vegtable with oyster sauce and you have yourself a meal.  You get the tea yourself which i found to be slightly strange.  But other than that..  food was good.. i got the special one with everything in it for 6 dollars.  i actually think there was more meat than noodles.    i would definately come back here... it has a hong kong vibe."}
{"text":"Found some hair inside the wonton. And also saw the lady handling the food behind the counter pick her nose and her ears then touched the noodles right after then had it served to a customer. I'm just appalled. Will be spreading the word about this experience to my friends. Would never ever go back in here. So f***** disgusting"}
{"text":"I've eaten here numerous times for...of course their noodles! That is what they are famous for! Service is always very fast. I usually go in, sit at any table, order my food when the waitress comes to give me my chopsticks, put my stuff down, go get tea/water...and by the time I'm done all that in a short period of time the food is already here! Talk about fast!!! One time I think my food came as fast as 30 seconds!  Anyways, I usually get the fish ball rice noodle or the wonton rice noodle. What I love the most about this place is the spicy chili oil. So delicious and spicy! I have an entire jar at home and I'm almost done the entire jar (definitely need to go get more). Just a huge warning though, it is very spicy so if you are unable to handle spicy, don't put so much or your mouth will be on fire. I am sure I will be back for more noodles and wontons in the future!"}
