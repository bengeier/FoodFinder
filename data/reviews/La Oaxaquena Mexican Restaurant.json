{"text":"Stopped by here as we were driving past and had checked yelp. Best chicken taco of my life..chicken tender and juicy..shells prepared after you order..Home made salsa.  Yum  next time I am in the neighborhood I will be stopping!"}
{"text":"Great little place to eat carnitas was awesome kids loved the rice and beans all around great place"}
{"text":"Definitely an interesting little place up in North Phoenix, La Oaxaquena hovers between a three and a four, but closer to four.  I stopped in for lunch and was shocked to see that there was not a single soul in there except for me.  What the heck??  

The classic unassuming strip-mall Mexican place, the interior was much bigger than normal and the colors were interesting but I thought they added a nice touch.  The cashier / server girl was really friendly and service was SUPER fast.

On to the food - I went with the lunch special of a taco and tostada for $4.95 (what a steal!).  I was assuming when I requested chicken that both items would have chicken on them - something to keep in mind.  The taco was excellent!  A crunchy shell housed deliciously tender chicken, and fresh lettuce and tomato on top.  The tostada was OK, but I think that has way more to do with the fact that I'm not a huge refried beans fan.  Oh, and the chips and salsa were some of the best complimentary additions I've had.

As Daren C. mentioned, $5.35 total will get you some good food, and you'll leave stuffed and ready to pass out in the afternoon of your job."}
{"text":"Darn it, I had gotten fond of the assertive fuchsia color scheme on their walls, and they changed it! Oh well, yellow and salmon work well too. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pM1XQqVX-oudcm4nnvvQfA?select=6vDWy6fMQnMAClThF4ZmUQ

Had lunch here again and loved it, as usual. Fresh salsa, warm tortilla chips, beans, rice, burro, bit of salad. Fast service, tasty food, very inexpensive ... really gotta love this place!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here now and then for many years.  They use to have really good flautas, but then they changed them to something else, which sucks.  They also got a D on their latest health inspection.  Doubt I'll eat there anymore."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend. I got a mini chimi platter for a party ant they were amazing. Everyone loved them. The waitstaff was really nice and even got the platter done early since I was early. Can't wait to go back and try some of the other items they make. :) recommend trying this hidden gem out!!!"}
{"text":"I have been back several times since my initial review and have not been disappointed. 

Today, Norm and I braved out the south side of 19th ave and Peoria. 

Once again it was an excellent meal, especially for $5.35. 

I had the red chili burrito with rice and beans and shared chips and salsa with Norm. The burro was full of chunks of beef simmered in red sauce and covered with cheese and more red sauce. The rice was perfect and the bean... oh the beans... you cannot have better. 

The staff was on top of it and extra friendly."}
{"text":"When I was here, I got heat stroke. There was a party in the back room, and everyone was crowding the bathrooms and I was sick. It sucked. 

While out in the restaurant, I had ordered a carne asada quesadilla. It sat and waited for me, as did the rest of the group. We came here to watch the last Lakers vs. Suns game. And yes, I did get to see the Suns lose in their home town. That was cool. (Los Suns jerseys or not, they aren't doing much to help end the hate there). 

The quesadilla tasted like a cheeseburger when I finally did get around to eating and stomaching it. I wasn't a fan of that. 

....@#$! AZ and their racist laws."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3 & a half stars if I could but cant bring myself to a 4 star rating for this place just yet.  I came here this morning and had the Chorizo & eggs plate.  Couldn't figure out why this place doesn't have breakfast burritos but it worked out well anyway.  I ordered it for take out and the food was great!  I was a little disappointed that the tortillas were not home-made.  Although you could tell there was a little preservative smell to them but did not taste to bad (just not home-made taste).  The salsa tasted fresh and the beans were great.  The atmosphere is a little scary but it looks pretty new still and it is pretty hard to find since the sign is pretty small.  I knew about it because they came by my office and dropped off a coupon for take out.  I will go back for sure but I am not in love yet."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special of chicken tacos. Deep fried and oily. Salsa was good, as was the rice and beans. Don't think I will be coming back."}
{"text":"been awhile since I did a review for anything.  it has not, however, been that long since I went here for food(half an hour ago, and several times in the last month). 
If only I lived in this area instead of just watching my parents house, Id be here every 2-3 days.....

This is my go to mexican restaurant.  I have tried all the rest in the 5 mile radius of 32nd ave and peoria.  Bueno burger, rolandos, federicos, filibertos, big burrito, and a couple other small ones like mi peublo and mexican food its all good off of cactus.

With all that said, NONE OF THOSE PLACES CAN TOUCH LA OAXAQUENA! Ive had the al pastor, the chicken and the asada(my favorite),  All were excellent.  They will make you a big burrito like chipotle does if you just ask for those things in the burrito.  They have the best rice and beans in this part of town, IF NOT THE WHOLE CITY.  
The steak is outrageously good, practically addictive. 

Im there so much when I come in they KNOW MY ORDER, they just need to know how many(I'll buy one burrito to eat then and another(or 2) for the next day or so(reheats wonderfully).  They remember repeat customers and take care of them.  I never have any problems, they're always nice and professional.   

I just hope someone reads this wall of text and says, no one would give this much effort for a lackluster establishment....  Try em out, you wont be disappointed.  Go during lunch hours for 5 dollar lunch specials with free chips and salsa."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, cause it's so close to work but.... No. 
My red chili burrito was all tortilla, a scrap of shredded beef was inside, it was cold and salty too.  :(  
The Spanish rice was undercooked. The gal that greeted me was super nice and friendly, the place looked clean and also I noticed they had \"A\" rating from"}
