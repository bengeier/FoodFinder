{"text":"Large restaurant with a large variety of food. Service is very quick at taking away plates. Has amazing food at a great price, cheaper than most buffet locations. Something to eat for everyone!"}
{"text":"Imperial Buffet closed down and Buffet Queen took its place. The decor and layout are pretty much the exact same.  I came here for dinner in a weekday with two other friends. The service was good, we constantly had our plates and left overs taken away and our beverages refilled.  The food however just didn't taste good. One of the biggest factors was because the place isn't busy enough. There aren't enough people to eat the food so the food just ends up sitting there for a while. For example, the ribs were super tough and a bit cold.  The restaraunt had a decent selection of food, but most of it sucked. The deserts were absolutely disgusting. I couldn't finish any of the deserts besides a basic maroon. I ended up eating the general tso chicken and the lemon chicken. The chicken pieces were over cooked but the sauce was good.  They had a separate grill where they would cook beef short ribs, roast beef, and some vegetables for you. The issue was that the cook himself didn't know what he was doing. I asked for a medium roast beef and he gave me a well done piece. I then asked for a rare piece and he gave me a blue piece. I didn't like the marinade of the beef short ribs either. The pineapple covered in cinnamon was good, I just wish it was cut up in smaller slices though.  One item that did taste great was the Peking duck.. Not sure if it was an everyday dish or a grand opening special.  I don't necessarily regret my visit, but there are much better options available. Our weekday dinner was $23.99 and I believe weekend is $28.99 (both prices before tax of course)."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars for the buffet style food, but five stars for the lobster, the peking duck that is served and made in front of you, the service and the fact that if you come and it's your birthday, it's free for you!  Okay, so weekend dinner is $28.99, weekday dinner is $23.99, plus tax. I'm not exactly sure how much it is for lunch, but I recall seeing a sign that it was around $15 for all you can eat. It sounds pretty expensive, cause I mean, you COULD go for sushi for this price, which is actually very true, but I don't think you could get freshly made deep fried lobster with great sauce and however much lobster you want for that price.  I usually go to Congee Queen or other restaurants to pay $20+ for a lobster yee mein, and here, the staff were super friendly and even brought it to our table, or if there weren't any outside (as business was a little slow), said that we could just order it and they would bring it to our table. The plates were all promptly changed, and we had drinks almost immediately, whenever we ordered. There was no surcharge for any soft drink. This place is still relatively new, so I totally understand if they were trying to make a good impression on their customers.   The sushi didn't quite appeal to me, nor did any of the cold mussels, crab legs, shrimp and clams. I DID, however appreciate the mussels that were stir fried in black bean sauce. The food wasn't super hot, but the lobster was definitely really good. I also enjoyed how they made the peking duck on a trolley and served it to the tables. I would go out to dim sum restaurants and pay $160 for a peking duck lobster meal and find that the peking duck doesn't have meat on it or isn't cooked properly. The peking duck here, is actually cooked properly - (a little longer than needed though, so it's not as juicy) and it has meat in it. I didn't have to add anything myself and it was all handmade (that's why the skin of the peking duck wrap is a little different).   For a Chinese buffet, I felt like it was edible as a Chinese person. Many of the Chinese buffets like Mandarin taste terrible to me. I would say, that it is buffet standard food, so don't expect it to be like those sit-down restaurants with amazing quality (the only thing amazing was really the lobster, and the black bean clams when it is freshly brought out). I could tell that it's hard to make the food super hot all the time as it's still a relatively new place, but I think the staff are really trying to listen to their customers and make it a good experience. Secondly, for all you can eat lobster and for a free meal to the birthday person, I definitely had a good and non expensive experience here. (No automated tip charge)."}

{"text":"The service was good, however the food was just terrible. The \"hot\" food was cold, the ice cream had freezer burn, the gummies were stale. I was very disappointed. It wasn't cheap either, at 28.99$/person plus tax we weren't impressed. When the manager asked us how the food was we told him not great and that it was cold, and he told us the heaters weren't working properly. Not sure why they were serving food if they couldn't keep it hot. Now we're all feeling quite sick, and additionally no discount was given even though they knew they weren't serving hot food. Wouldn't recommend =("}
{"text":"We should have gone to the Mandarin.  They have been open for 3 weeks so we thought we would try.  Everything was cold.  It had been out for a bit so it was dry.  We will not be back."}
{"text":"The food was okay but it's definitely not as high quality as even fast food Asian food, the Wednesday price of $19.99 (has a bottomless soft drink included) was good but anything more than that it's not worth it I'd rather go to Mandarin for a few dollars more, but the service was pretty good overall, the food selection isn't the best and I didn't appreciate them adding random ingredients to dishes such as adding shrimp to the Shanghai noodles because that takes away an option for possible vegetarian guests. Also the dessert selection was terrible and wasn't that good, also most of the ice cream is the same flavor with a different label. I don't regret going there but I'm not sure I'll go back unless I hear changes are made."}
