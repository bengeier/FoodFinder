{"text":"Yummy! So many to choose from and they are all perfectly delicious. Tip: ask them to make you a fresh Nutella pizza- it's to die for!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Town! Yes it is a very small pizza joint but you go for the experience of eating possibly the best pizza you've ever had. They've researched a multitude of italian pizzerias from Italy and brought back a way of making pizza which I've never had before. There is always a huge selection of different pizza's to try and you can even order a pizza with multiple toppings. I highly recommend this Pizzeria!"}
{"text":"Place is amazing. Light dough with nice crunch on the bottom makes it one of the best pizzas in town by far. I literally got a little slice of every pizza they had, very reasonably price ! Would suggest that if your in the area to give it a try , truly worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. I like the concept of the pay by the pound. The crust us amazing it is heavenly. The only bad thing is when they run out of the pizza you want. So yeah it is 20 different kinds of pizza (or whatever the number) but they often do not have all 20 throughout selling the pizza during the day."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations. Looking at the photos, it seemed like giant slabs of pizza cut with scissors and weighed etc etc...

But man oh man, the pizza was flavourful, light, and delicious. The ingredients were simple, and I could really taste the tomato sauce they used. I did not feel all carb-overloaded or heavy after eating 2 slices of their Za'!

I will return and try a wider assortment of slices next time :)

P.S THEY HAVE BEER! Nothing better than an ice cold Perroni to go with your pizza"}
{"text":"This pizza by weight is unreal! It truly mimics the authentic flavours I remember of Italy. Amazing crust, great flavour, fresh ingredients. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Tried this little pizzeria with my wife after reading the reviews, I gotta say it's some of the best tasting pizza we've had in a while. Very nice tasting dough, the right crisp and the right amount of chew. The toppings appear to be more traditional, not bastardized Canadian or Hawaiian type stuff you find at pizza pizza.

The girl behind the counter was super friendly and pretty too!

Good eatin."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Vaughan hands down.  Was looking for a new place after my go to let me down and when I found Ciao Roma everything seemed right again. It is a little bit more expensive than your run of the mill pizza place but it is worth it.

The pizza is absolutely perfect every time.  If you are just walking in for yourself you can try different pizzas because they cut pieces (with scissors just like Nonna) to order as big or small as you want.

MUST KNOW:
Cash only.  ATM inside but who wants to pay service fees."}
{"text":"It's no wonder than John Catucci and his crew graced this Woodbridge pizza joint 2 years ago because, You (REALLY) Gotta Eat Here!

Ciao Roma has been on my GTA Bookmark list since writing my first ever Pizza Weekly Yelp almost 4 years ago! Why haven't I visited? The 905 is a big place you guys, cut a brother some slack, ok? That said, I was so happy that my busy travels brought me hungry and in need of a quick pizza fix to the plaza directly across the street this weekend.

Having never been here before, I let the girl behind the counter know as much and without skipping a beat she began to walk me through the process that makes them different. The pizza is made in giant uncut rectangular slabs in traditional Roman style - toppings and then cheese. The server will cut a line (with scissors) down the middle line of the slab and then ask you how big a slice you want. Once you've instructed how large a slice you'd like they weight it and finish cooking it off (not just warming it up) in the small over behind the counter. 

As mentioned by others, the pizza is weighed and you are charged by weight. Done deal. Prices were fine as I paid only about $5.50 for a sizable slice. I went with the mushroom and smoked provolone pizza, and contrary to other reviews, I found the amount of toppings to be just fine - sometimes a little less is more. Easily the best part about this pizza is the crispy, thick crust, simply delicious!

{"text":"My boys love pizza; they would eat it every day if we would allow them. The other night, we stopped into Ciao Roma Pizza on the way home from Tai Kwon Do. Ciao Roma Pizza was recommended to us by the mother of one of my son's classmates. Her daughter has dairy allergies and orders pizza without the cheese. The atmosphere is old school, traditional Italian. The pizza was delicious. I would probably rate this place 4-5 stars if Alex wouldn't find a hair in his pizza :("}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favourite pizza places in Canada! I haven't had pizza like this since I was in Rome, and simply stepping onto the premises brought me back. 

At first glance, the giant slabs of pizza may be intimidating and appear to be heavy, however once being warmed up they are light, crunchy, slices of happiness. The toppings are flavourful, the tomato sauce perfectly compliments the dough without overpowering it. 

Although it is about 40 minutes away from my house, I can confidently say that I will be returning the next time I'm craving quality pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious! If you just want to try a few different slices,they cut you whatever size you want with scissors and you pay by weight."}
{"text":"Pretty much the most legit Ai Taglio Pizza spot in Vaughan. They don't do the generic \"pepperoni pizza\" but if you want to find a pie that will tantalize your tastebuds with flavours of ricotta and balsamic or potato and rosemary with sopressata, this is the place to go. They also make killer rice balls. The Nutella Pizza js a personal favourite of mine"}
{"text":"When in Woodbridge and hunkering for a little bite of Italian love, head to Caio Roma! 
This small establishment located in a strip mall delivers (figuratively) the taste of Roman style pizza by the slice. A variety of slices, including full pies are available to be ordered. The slices are sold by weight and you pick the size you want, a few minutes in the oven and BAM, Rome is on your tastebuds. Yes the prices are higher than your cookie cutter pizza box stores, but as they say \"you get what you pay for!\" Flavours are great, and quality provides that little crunch with every bite. A limited number of seats are available which means you get the chance to rub elbows with the 905'ers who have nothing but great advice on where to get the best eats in Woodbridge. 
Enjoy and mangera pasaeno, mangera!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Roman style pizzas with chewy focaccia base and simple, combination toppings. 

All slices are by weight. 
I didn't take a pic of the ones with balsamic drizzle, but really enjoyed those. 
The mushroom, Bocconcini and truffle oil is a tasty combo. 

Also tried the arancini: meat and spinach. Both were tasty with nice ratio of rice to filling and not too oily."}
{"text":"They were right, this certainly is one of (if not the) best Roma style pizzas in the city AND doesn't destroy your wallet!

It's a nice, tiny little shop, and as soon as you walk in, your eyes feast on the \"belissimo\" slices of pizza alreay cooked. They are SO creative with the combination of ingredients, potato and proscuitto, smoked provalone with mixed wild mushrooms.....it really can't get more authentic. With so much to choose from, and with a few sitting areas in the shop, this would be a perfect lunch spot for people in the area.

 I came with a group of 4, and we decided to order a full party size pizza - only a 20 minute wait, can't complain about that! We chose the Amitricano, which had parmesean cheese, tomato sauce, hot salami, pancetta and proscuitto... Definitley was the works haha! The gentleman who took our order (and whom I believe is the owner as he's featured in lovely news articles about the shop posted around the store) was extremely friendly and seemed to truly care about whether or not we enjoyed our meal; true sign of excellent customer service!

Our pizza was served to us on personal trays, accounting for a total of 24 slices. As much as I wanted to finish all 6 of my beautifully savoury, fresh pizza slices, i had to bring some home for later, too stuffed haha!

Another side note I noticed is that the workers speak Italian which i think is VERY admirable! Really is the cherry on top for the authenticity of Ciao Roma!

Very impressed with this place, love the intimacy of the shop, and the quality and variety of pizza offered. Definitley will return next time im in the area :)"}
{"text":"I used to like coming here but after several poor experiences, I've decided to never eat here again.  The one good thing about this place is the crust on the pizza.  Is it worth the high price? Probably not.  And lately it seems they can't warm up a slice without burning the hell out of the crust. Some of the other issues I've experienced with this place is: 
1) extraordinarily long wait times where I would order a pizza for pick up but then I would have to wait a half hour past the time they told me to come in for pick up. 
2) Over charged- This place does not like giving out receipts. They only take cash.  Keep an eye on them when weighing the pizza. The girls at the counter weighed the same slice twice and there's no real way to know if you've been over charged. 
3) I wasn't going to make a review about this place. Mainly because I don't have time to do so.  But after getting the same disgusting meat rice balls on 3 separate occasions when I specifically requested the \"NO MEAT\" rice balls on each of those occasions, I've decided that enough was enough.  When I called the store they basically called me a liar and told me I could go back and exchange the rice balls. Umm..no thank you.  I'm not going out of my way to return food that you messed up on.  The only reason I stopped in the first place is to get something quick.

Pros:
crust (when they don't burn the crap out of it)

Cons: 
Customer Service
Toppings (bland and scarce)
Overcharge
Cash Only/no receipt
Hours
Long wait times
No Sauce (If you like sauce on your pizza then this place isn't for you since they don't use sauce on their pizza)"}
{"text":"Ciao Roma,

It's my pleasure to meet you (Rectangular Pizza) once again.
Memories take me way back to our High school days.
The wild Party (Pizzas) we had, do you remember?    3.5'd

You were just a Plain (Pepperoni Cheese) Square back then.
How you've Flour-ished (Crunchy!!) since your time in Rome.
Your Al Taglio attitude is a breath of Fresh (Ingredients) air.

No longer are you satisfied by mainstream (N.A  ingredients) selections.
Instead you search for authentic (Italian ingredients) brands,
and premium (Price) products to match your overseas lifestyle (Light & Healthy).

No one can label (None. Ask server for Pizza choices) you any longer.
While deep down, I see glimpse of the you (Fast Food/Take-away Joint) I once knew.

I'm sure I'll get to see a much sweeter (Nutella Pizza) side of you soon.
I will make it my personal request the next time we meet.

Arrivederci,
WaYnE"}
{"text":"I live in Woodbridge. Definitely one of the best pizza places around. Found out the cook is from Rome.  And it shows."}
{"text":"They still cut the pizza with scissors and then you pay by weight just like in Rome

Just like at my house except I don't have a scale

And the pizza is still the best in the area"}
{"text":"I really like the concept of buying pizza by weight.  With a selection of about a dozen different pizzas (pizzae?), it is a drag having to decide. Decide no more!  Give me a segment of everything!

Let's start with the crust, the proverbial \"foundation\" of a good grease wheel.  This was one of the nicest crusts I have had, good chew throughout, but crispy as a cracker on the bottom.

I would have liked more toppings.  Of the variety of pizza, there were very few with meat on top, maybe a quarter of them.  When meat was part of the pizza, it was fairly sparse, like you would see under the counter of Pizza Pizza (not to compare).  The toppings were all top notch, but a bit on the barren side.

The favourite for flavour was the mushroom pizza, with a variety of meaty, delicious mushrooms, it was the most enjoyable.

As John Catucci claims \"You Gotta Eat Here\", this is definitely worth a try. I would love to pay more per pound for more abundant toppings."}
{"text":"Been meaning to come for weeks. The pizza was beyond words. Had the Margharita and the Patata. The crust is perfection incarnate - not too thick or thin. The sauce is also perfect - just the right amount of tanginess and not salty. Just perfect. 

Had a couple of arancini as well. I am in my happy place right now."}
{"text":"Food here is as everyone says, amazing. 
Some of the best pizza I've ever had.

On top of that for my daughter's birthday party we ordered a large delivery ordered which was delivered by the owner himself, still decked out in his chef whites. I offered him a hefty tip for coming on such short notice and with so much pizza, but he declined the big tip and said he was happy to help.

Great service, great food, we'll be going here for years to come."}
{"text":"It's pretty good, the concept is different.  Different from
Conventional pizzas. The crust is light and flaky but not oily.  Tried the potato and salami, the spicy and the mushroom red pepper pizzas."}
{"text":"Best crispy crust with variety. Paid by weight. Get awesome potato onion, or chilli pizza. Superb taste"}
{"text":"Thank you Wayne for the heads up on this pizza place. Minimal seating featuring 1 table for two with a cool kitchen view, a couple bars with seats, and a hipster indie coffee shop communal type table. They still aren't labeling their pizzas and you have to kind of guess what's what. Most are obvious, although one that looks like a Hawaiian turned out to be potato and ham (hello echos of Korean pizza http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biIKpegx7h4). A couple are \"white pizzas\" without sauce.

Love they have Brio, which taste wise reminds me of a can of 1970s Cott Cola (http://www.pic2fly.com/viewimage/Q290dCBDb2xh/aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kaWFtb25kY29rZWNhbnMuY29tL090aGVyU29kYUJyYW5kcy9Db3R0L0NvdHQoMTBvekNvbGEpLkpQRw). Cott seemed to owe much of its taste to the taste of the can as the soda ingredients. In other words, Brio isn't a cola for anyone and might be something of an acquired taste.

The pizza comes on a focaccia like buttery dough.  

I found the sauceless slices to be just okay but the sauce-based slices a real delight. Care seems to be placed on using premium ingredients. 

The trick at this place is you ask for a slice of pie any size you want and you're charged based on weight. It will run you more than Pizza Pizza but then you're not here for a quick lunch of cardboard right? A tray of various slices enough for two plus two beverages ran just under $20. Not bad at all. 

This is cash only. No credit cards or even debit. 

A cool, casual, exotic date place, especially on a Sunday (yes, despite being in an industrial mall off Weston this place is open) after a morning of shopping at Vaughan Mills."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza today for a meeting at the office and boy was it a hit. Everyone loved this Roman style pizza."}
{"text":"Decent pizza... it isn't worth dying for but it is good.

Wish they had more seating... don't go as much because you can never get a seat.

Only downside is the custom-order pizza takes FOREVER to get done... so call ahead and order... 

Wish they accepted credit cards - the \"cash only\" trend with these types of restaurants is really annoying.

I like my pizza thinner and more well done with less dough in the pizza, which combined with the above is the reason why I can't give this place a 5-star review like many others have."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good here, but I don't know if it's enough to justify the price. After two slices and two drinks I paid about 18 dollars and they don't accept anything but cash in which I paid more for using their ATM. As for the pizza itself the crust was good. We had a slice with salami and hot peppers and one with a few types of mushrooms and truffle oil. Good but just didn't live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Wow!  One of the best pizzas I've ever had!!  Amazing light crust and the mozzarella is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Everybody has their own preferred style of pizza.  Mine involves a thin crust with lots of tangy tomato sauce.  Ciao Roma's pizza is pretty much the opposite of that, but I still enjoyed it.  My kids like their pizza with more bread and less sauce, so they were happy.  I liked that was able to try several of the 8 or so varieties they had when I came in, because they cut your slice to order and you pay by weight."}
{"text":"We had takeout tonight from this cute little place. It was worth the drive to Woodbridge.

Ordered five different kinds, little pieces of each, which they cut again in half. Perfect. Will be having more for lunch tomorrow. I prefer less ingredients and less cheese because then have room to try different kinds. The Nutella was amazing! The zucchini one and the tomato/bocconcini one were also delicious.

Will definitely return."}
{"text":"My brother introduced to me to Ciao Roma Pizza and I stop by here whenever I am in the area.

Ciao Roma Pizza is delicious, crisp, and light! When you first walk in, you will see a display of different pizzas available and you request a slice any size you want it is is weighed. You can also order the pizzas as a whole.

Only 4 stars as I find this place quite pricey, $10 can get you the equivalent to a personal pizza.

They take cash only."}
{"text":"Great place, and I will be back.  I like the idea of being able to select a number of different pizzas to try, and the paying by weight is a good idea for this reason.  The pizza was excellent , especially the crust which shines.  Staff were patient (explaining how everything works), fast and very friendly.  The only reason I am not giving full marks is because, as mentioned in an earlier review, they are light on the meat in these pizzas, and they are a little pricey - for what is the equivalent of a large 12 inch you are paying over $25 - but every slice is different.   Compared to Pizza Break ($9.99 large 12\" 3 topping) it's steep, but you definitely taste the difference in the ingredients - especially the crust.  Honestly it was refreshing to eat quality pizza for a change.   Overall I would definitely recommend and will be back."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Toronto handsdown.  Not much room to sit but whatever, gotta take points off for not taking debit or credit."}
{"text":"This place is so awesome! Hidden away in an industrial plaza in Vaughan, this pizza place is serving what they claim to be authentic Roman style pizza. I've never been to Rome or Italy so I don't know what's authentic or not but I really enjoyed the pizza here. 

We got a couple of the ready-made slices, I understand that you can order a freshly made pizza as well. We picked a couple slices to try and it was cut to our size preference. For about 3 large slices cut into two slices each (about a medium sized pizza's worth) it cost us about $15 with a water bottle, which is a good price considering two people had more than enough to eat, although the dessert pizzas did sound tempting. 

Like most people have mentioned, the star is the crust. The focaccia bread which is the base of this pizza tastes like fresh baked Italian bread. It's crispy at the bottom and doughy and bready in the middle and the toppings are fresh, albeit light, but it's not a heavy, greasy pizza place. They seem to want to showcase that dough and it's texture and flavour and it really shines through. The toppings are more like a compliment to the dough as opposed to the dough simply being a vessel for toppings. The toppings are really great though, I was impressed that they have things like smoked Gouda, sweet and spicy salami, fresh mozzarella and bocconcini, which seem to be more authentic than your standard pepperoni and shredded mozzarella.

A normal person can probably get full off of a bigger slice because the crust is thicker and more substantial than a traditional pizza so you really can't eat as much as you would at a standard pizza place, which is my argument against people saying It's on the pricier side. It is definitely more expensive than Pizza Hut but if you want to try a unique pizza place, this is it. It's homemade tasting, the pizzas are beautiful and appear to be made with love and pride, it's worth the money for the quality and flavour.

The restaurant isn't anything special, it looks like a standard pizza takeout place, there are a couple of seats for a quick bite but it's not a family restaurant, there's no table service. Parking out front is free and ample. This isn't a place you'll stumble upon though, you'll have to go looking for it, but there's large signage so you won't miss it once you're driving by. 

Service was good, the girl at the counter was friendly and prompt and we didn't feel intimidated by the unique process of ordering. No table service, so ordering and paying is the only interaction we had with any staff. 

Overall I will definitely come back for pizza to try some other flavours, maybe try that Nutella pizza!"}
{"text":"Went here with a friend after he saw it on \"You gotta eat here\" - Oh em gee delicious pizza! The simplicity of their toppings, their perfect crust, the perfect combinations of toppings, plus great friendly service; all in all a fab experience which makes me wish I lived closer! haha"}
{"text":"Strange yet great place. It is a tad small so there is not much room to sit and eat but the food itself is great. Lots of different types of pizza's to choose from and the hilarious thing is that you pay based on the weight. They weigh all your items and charge you the price while it gets heated in the oven. You can order entire pizzas if you want but if you want to try a bunch of slices of different types of authentic style pizza, this is a great place to do that."}
{"text":"First off, let me start by saying Yummmmm.  Ok, now that we got that out of the way. Service was quick.  Pizza  has a beautiful crispy bottom and soft dough centre with nice chew. Quality toppings and a wide variety of pies.  Can't wait to go back. Keep up the great work Rob and team!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Roman-style pizza for the first time and it was a pretty good and tasty experience. As soon as you enter the tiny casual dining place which has a few small tables, you see a display case with about 10 gigantic rectangular pizzas. Each one has a few different toppings and there a couple of types that have no sauce and no or little cheese. Once you've decided what you want, the server will cut the gigantic pizza down the middle length-wise. She'll then cut a strip as wide as you want with no particular \"minimum\" and then charge based on the weight of all the strips. See pic for an example of a strip. Each strip was cut in the middle once again. The ones I got were potato (with some meat), prosciutto, and onion which cost around $9 total. With any of the strips, the crust was the star and was light, airy, and on the soft side. The potato, which I initially thought was pineapple on a Hawaiian style (I know, how dare me), was surprisingly my favorite. I was expecting the potato to be a little on the hard side like I've had at other places, but they're more like mashed potato creating an interesting creaminess and added texture to the pizza. The prosciutto and onion ones were good too, but not great. There's lots of parking in this small strip plaza in the heart of Woodbridge. Overall, I enjoyed the experience, but the pizzas were much too plain for my taste and not worth a special trip out of my way."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Cute little spot when you walk in. Ordered a variety to share and it wasn't blow your mind, different, just very traditional, simple ingredient pizzas. Could have had a decent sit down meal at a little trattoria for the price. Service was bland and no ambience whatsoever. Maybe ok for takeout but pricy."}
{"text":"Ciao Roma is just so perfect for me!

Someone that wants to try everything and could not make up his/her mind.

All those delicious looking pizza are ready to be sold by weight. I just want to try everything. 

There is a menu right on the wall that describe every kind of pizza they serves which are all baked freshly in the kitchen on the side. But guessing which is which can be tricky.

The pizza I ordered are reheated in the oven and they all come out crispy and hot. And the bread like crust is the best part of the pizza!! Of course the premium toppings makes every slices/squares so unique!

Nutella pizza.. I want some of those next time!! Sugar and Carbs always a good ending of every meal!"}
{"text":"BEST BEST BEST PIZZA EVER!!!  Cash only.  The crust... how is it like this?  Unreal!  Delicious and I dreamed about the crust and toppings for days!  It is the best pizza I ever had.  Nothing in Italy and Canada and United States compares.  (There was a couple of other places I liked... one in Niagara Falls and the other is in Woodbridge, like this place is... but is far off the charts from this place)  I love how you can get strips of diffrrent ones in the restaurant or get a 1/2 or whole pizza.  These are huge.  Prices are comparable to big named pizza places... but here, it's all natural, real, authentic!  You want quality not quantity... look no further!  You won't get better than this... there is no better than this"}
{"text":"Had the potato, sausage, rosemary and mozzarella pizza. It was absolutely delicious! I love the decor inside with the cool looking wall. We ordered a half pizza and it only took like 20 mins for a fresh one to be made. While we waited we had a fried rice ball which was really tasty as well. It gets really busy at lunch so you can tell its a hot spot! 
I'd come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Shit service, the customer service person didn't even acknowledge me for a while. Then, when when I asked for recommendations as I was new she was blank face and didn't care. Didn't recommend anything. Just pointed at the toppings and told me the price - again! 
I only went here cuz it was recommended in food network. WILL NOT EVER listen to Food network and will not go back here. They got 1 more star only cuz the pizza was good. But I'm sure u can get same pizza elsewhere without he \"attitude\" without feeling like you are not wanted."}
{"text":"You got try this place.  Great new twist of flavours.  You buy by the weight so try the different varieties.  Don't be shy. Not for those on a diet."}
{"text":"For years I've been searching for a place like Ciao Roma! Hands down the best pizza I've had in Toronto and you get to have as many varieties as you want/can stuff in your face. This isn't your average round pizza - they are large rectangular pies that they slice and warm for you.

We originally ordered small(ish) slices of 4 different varieties, but they brought out a fresh pie while we were scarfing down Round One and HAD to get it (I forget what it was, but balsamic glaze was involved and it was amazing!). And why not?! Less than $20 with sodas and we left completely stuffed.  I can't make any particular recommendations because they were all amaze-balls! 

Cash only, so keep that in mind before you go! AND YOU MUST GO! Do it!"}
