{"text":"Main points: friendly service, knowledgeable staff, good atmosphere and great food. 

We (my fiancee Chuck and I)  were asked where we'd like to sit and were able to sit on the patio. The restaurant area is a family friendly atmosphere with easy listening music played at a reasonable level.  We also walked past a bar area that looked well stocked and lively. We were there on a weekend but the menu had some great happy hour specials monday-friday. We were also pleased with a nice bottled beer selection. 
The food was well timed; we had time to enjoy everything but we weren't waiting between courses. We started with the Killa Shrimp which came out warm and quick. They were crisp and coated in a delicious glaze reminiscent of a sweet and sour sauce. House salads came with our meals and were  sparsely topped, but fresh, and the croutons were like crunchy little garlic bread bites.
Chuck had the 16 piece oyster sampler (4 each of 4 different varieties) and these oysters were huge. His favorite of the platter was the \"grilled,\" and he thought the cheese grits side was a good pairing w/ the platter. Someone at a neighboring table was also raving about how enjoyable to raw oysters were.  
I had the fried catfish dinner. Nice batter; crispy and not at all soggy. The seasonal side is a sweet potato served w/ a sweet glaze, but they were accommodating when I asked for butter only. The star of my dish was the hush puppies, highly recommended! 
Despite being ridiculously full we ordered dessert. I had the chocolate cake which could have been shared w/ a couple others. Moist and rich, but a large portion and very sweet. Chuck had the bread pudding and he loved it. 
The happy surprise of the evening was the cigar bar. Comfortable seating and huge televisions great for watching sports. It wouldn't hurt the bartender to crack a smile, but other than that a great place to end the night with a drink and a smoke."}
{"text":"This was our first time dining here. It's a rather unfortunate location, tucked away off the road. My husband didn't know it was there. I wish we'd gone sooner. This area of the South Hills is in dire need of good restaurants, and this was much better the other always-busy nameless chains up the road. 

Everything we ordered was great. We started with the fried green tomatoes, which were tasty. I had a shrimp po'boy, my husband had the shrimp and grits, and we shared a half dozen char grilled oysters. All three dishes were delicious. I especially liked the shrimp and grits; it was as good as any we've had vacationing in the South.

The restaurant is clean and cute. Our server was on top of things. I see this is the only location of the chain in PA. I hope it makes it!"}
{"text":"The food,  as well as the service, was very, very good! One has to understand that when it comes to reviews, there will always be \"haters\". The best way to review, is to actually go there yourself, and we're glad that we did! The oysters Rockefeller were so good, my wife, who doesn't like oysters, actually ate them!!! She had salmon and I had the broiled platter. I'm a big guy and it was plenty to satisfy my huge appetite! The bread pudding was rich, buttery... Reminded me of my mom's! Please go, you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"I was excited to see a Seafood place in the South Hills as I am not a fan of Red Lobster. What a great idea but poor execution. Located in the New/ Old Damon's location in South Land Wintzell's was disappointing. We came for lunch and ordered the catch of the day Grouper (one grilled & one blackened) came with one side. The server also brought what I thought was garlic toast but it was soft and not crunchy nor could I taste the garlic. The bread  would have been great to use to sop up steamed clam broth however I don't think they serve clams. The grouper was OK nothing that would make you say Yum or Mmmm.  

Our server was busy visiting with a couple that appeared to be friends or regulars and kept us as an after thought. 

Most likely we will not go back..."}
{"text":"Horrible! First visit tonight and it will be our last. Waited at the hostess stand for over 5 minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant.  Had the drink special 4 dollar bloody Mary's they were horrible we didn't even finish half of them. My husband had the catch if the day which was tuna. He ordered it rare it came out extremely well done. It was dry and in edible. The waitress did take it back and they made a new one which was still over cooked about medium.  It was dry and chewy and completely flavorless we brought it home for our cat.  I had the broiled platter the scallops were little bay scallops not jumbo like in the picture but they were okay the shrimp was also just okay my fish was extremely small the oysters were gritty and the whole platter was burnt to the pan and soaked in butter. For the overpriced seafood and extremely over cooked quality your better off going to red lobster!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  I ordered the chili and shrimp salad and my husband had gumbo and the oyster platter.  Shrimp salad was just ok although the chili was delicious.  My husband thought the gumbo was the best part of his meal. That's not saying much since he ordered oysters and this is an oyster restaurant.  Just seems like another chain restaurant that doesn't put a lot of time or effort into their food.  The service was great.  

Would not go back."}
{"text":"I can kick myself for driving past this place so many times. Not any more! 
Excellent selection of real seafood dishes from apps to entrees and in between.  If you like oysters, this is THE place in the Burgh. They are not the little ones u usually get. Shrimp, scallops, fish, and great steaks chicken and burgers all at decent prices. 
Great bar too!"}
{"text":"I've been here three times.  The first trip was early summer. It was hot outside.  We sat on the patio under cover during a thunderstorm.  There were 10 people in our group.  Nobody else was there.   Drinks came slow.  Apps can slow. And the meal was cold.  I was not thrilled.  The second visit was better.  There were 6 of us and we ate in the bar while drinking Sam Adams specials.  $2 Oktoberfest!  The service was much better and the food was hot.  We ordered the sampler oyster app. Large and fresh!  I particularly liked the Spicy jalape√±o and cheese oysters.  I've not yet tried raw bc Pittsburgh is just too far from the ocean for me.  I had catfish.  Delicious.  Third trip was outstanding.  Packed house.  Fast knowledgeable service.  Lots of drink specials.  Went with the oyster sampler again.  Awesome.  And I also had the ribeye.   I love when a ribeye is pan seared.  It locks in the flavor and seasoning.   Ribeyes cooked on grilles lose all their richness.  This medium rare gem was talked about for days.  I will definitely go back.  I think the restaurant found its mojo."}
{"text":"Like it here good service it's the closest your  going to get in Pittsburgh if you like this style of food and it's pretty darn good.  Been here 3-4 times and never a bad experience.  Excellent gumbo!"}
{"text":"Heard about this restaurant from reading the City paper.  So glad I took a chance.  The food is wonderful.  I love fried oysters and they serve the best in Pittsburgh. I've been there 3 times.  My last visit was nothing but superb.  My baked potato was fresh, white and fluffy, oysters were fried to perfection, the fried fish was nicely seasoned, and the hush puppies were nice.  The food is always hot. The service was good. I belonged to the clean plate club that day.  I don't eat raw oysters but other guests told us that they serve some of the best."}
{"text":"I've been there twice since they opened about a month ago. The food is very good and priced accordingly. They have different types of specials such as alligator ribs (which I did not try). They also have very good happy hour specials, a dozen of raw oysters for $5.95.

The staff was friendly and the atmosphere was very good."}
{"text":"Made a trip out here from Ohio just to get crappy service.  I'm 27 years old and they wouldn't serve me a drink because they never saw an Ohio ID. Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"If your looking for a refreshing change in a seafood Resturant then this is a place you must try."}
{"text":"Went to this place on Friday and had a great fun experience. The oyster po boy was openface and had a ton of good skinny fries with it. We also ordered the orange chicken which was delicious and very suitable for those watching their health/weight. The appetizer and my long island iced tea were on happy hour special and well worth the price. My husband ordered a Capt. Morgan rum and Coke which was eight dollars. Surprise!
We'll be back."}
{"text":"Good service, disappointing meal.
Understanding that this is not LA (lower Alabama), expectations were not that high. Unfortunately, those were not even met. Red Beans and Rice with chicken? OK, I can understand it, but the crab Au Graten was a bowl of chowder. For $15! It was listed as a meal. I understand that we are not in the south, but I cannot believe that Wintzells put their name to this."}
{"text":"Excited to try a new seafood place in the South Hills! Wintzell's has been open only about two weeks and is still seemingly experiencing some opening night jitters. We went there on Memorial Day and with only a dozen or so other guests, service was kind of slow. The food was good, though - very good in fact. Definitely a southern influence (Wintzell's is from Alabama).

I had a Grilled Shrimp Po'Boy and my wife has Fried Oysters. We ordered beers, which took a loonnng time to get. And our waitress kept bringing incomplete items (i.e. my son's ice cream without a spoon to eat it with) and having to run back to complete, which could take a while. With all that said, I feel this place has promise ... we'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I had originally given this place a negative review but since the new management and staff are in place they have done a 180.  I have been here about a half dozen times in the past few months and they have really upped their game!  Good job!  Great service and great food. It 's a winner!"}
{"text":"First of all let me say hey if you look at my profile you will see my hometown is Pittsburgh so when I occasionally go back for a visit I want every dining experience to be great especially one for a new comer like Wintzell's.  That said it was disappointing, after two visits over the past several months the best I can say is that it was just OK, which for me is lackluster.

Let's see the first trip with my wife we both ordered a dozen oysters and they were so bad we sent them back - WTF they do call them selves an oyster house right?  My second visit last week with my two sisters we all had a lobster tail special and it was just OK.  And, why would they establish an adjoining cigar bar right next to the restaurant I have no idea, although it looked cool, these things are white elephants in this day and age.

I will say the staff was friendly, efficient and willing to please but that's about it."}
{"text":"Everything tasted good.... BUT.. The lettuce in the salad was wilted and dry as it had obviously been put under a heat lamp. It was also an ugly salad unattractively presented with not nearly enough greens either. The oysters in it were delicious though. The bread was low grade, but tasted OK. The fried green tomatoes were hard and the batter was without flavor, but the sauce they give you for it was good. The mussels appetizer was good for the happy hour price, but it had just barely enough garlic and other stuff to register. I think they have a minimalist ethic there about flavoring food and it's a problem for me. I'll go back when I want good fried oysters but little else."}
{"text":"Really nice surprise in da Burgh!   I have eaten in a ton of good Southern spots and this stacks up well.  We came here for two birthday celebrations. The new crab bites were crispy outside, tender inside, lots of crab and the spicy sauce was delicious!   He got the oyster sampler; I got fried oysters.  Major yum!  (They have lots of non oyster stuff on the menu, but we love oysters)  Our server Beth was friendly and knowledgable.  Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"The Enjoy Book has reported that Wintzell's in Pittsburgh is permanently closed.  Also, the Pittsburgh location is no longer shown on Wintzell's website."}
{"text":"We have eaten gulf coast seafood in New Orleans, Mississippi, 'Bama, and Florida..this place was like taking a trip to the gulf! Oysters fresh(of course not NOLA but excellent) ...ingredients great! Highly recommend the raw oysters and Po boy! The fried Po boy oysters were great bec they didn't over fry them!  I like it better than Acme oyster Houses in NOLA!! Not a huge fan of their French fries but went for seafood not fries! Great beer and drink selection!
Happy Hour is amazing!! Half price oysters!"}
{"text":"This charming place is tucked away in the corner of Pittsburgh, but I am so glad to give it a try. The restaurant is spacious with an \"old town\" feel to it. There is a bar area on one side and booths/tables on the other side. The service was phenomenal with very attentive and friendly staff. For a seafood place, I thought it was quite affordable. If you're on a budget, go for their happy hour $5 appetizers menu to get the bang for your bucks. 

First thing first, I had to try their oysters since this is an \"oyster house\". I only like my oyster prepared one way and that is RAW. Prices for raw oysters change with the season, so call in for specific pricings and specials. The oysters were fresh, plump and well cleaned (yay for no cracked shells). Just squeeze on some lemon juice and squirt a bit of Tabasco sauce with a pinch of salt...perfection! 

After the oysters, I just ordered straight from the happy hour menu featuring the $5 appetizers. There are some hits and misses with these options though. The hits: mussels in garlic sauce and jerk chicken chili nachos. The mussels in garlic sauce must be my favorite dish here. The mussels, soaked in garlic, butter and white wine sauce just melted in my mouth. The jerk chicken chili nachos had a unique combination of flavors and texture--sweet, savory, creamy, and crispy. The miss: fish tacos. I thought their fish tacos were way too salty and really lacking comparing to the other food options. 

Overall, I was satisfied with my eating experience at Wintzell's and would gladly recommend this place to my fellow seafood lovers. Their raw oyster is definitely top-notch and a lot cleaner than Joe's Crab Shack. For my fellow seafood lovers with a tiny wallet, I highly recommend going here during happy hours."}
{"text":"It's taken me a minute to write this review because I'm not sure how I feel about it but here goes...

This was the Father's Day restaurant selected and I was anxious to try a spot touting they specialize in seafood. The menu had a large selection of offerings and we ordered a lot of food and sampled. 

Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted and led to our table.  The floor made me want to gag. It wasnt what you could see but what you could feel. Think of grimy carpet that has a mixture of oil and dirt...sludge, maybe? In any case, the fact that my heels were sticking to it made me a little uneasy but the place \"looked\" clean. Odd but I had to share.  There were a few other folks there but it was still very early (about 20 minutes after opening).

The server was attentive and informed us of the specials. We opted for nachos, fried green tomatoes a seafood platter, onion rings, steamed shrimp, fried shrimp and a loaded baked potato bigger than my head...and that's big folks! The fish filet was the winner. Moist, flavorful and crispy is the best way to describe it...lawwddd...good. The fried green tomatoes were enormous but lacked any real flavor. The sauce they covered them with was good but killed the crispiness that you want. The steamed shrimp didn't go over well at all because my daughter and I got sick. It was the only thing that we consumed in common and messed up a large portion of our day. 

So, while the fish filet was good and service was pretty good, it's not enough to make me want to return after the bad experience with the shellfish. With places like Luke Wholey's Alaskan grille where I know my fish is fresh, it's just not worth the gamble."}
{"text":"Went there right after it opened, food was excellent, service was spotty but it was expected as they were only open a few days. Place showed some promise!  Went back.... Fish was cooked perfectly,  staff was very welcoming .... everything else was a disappointment. Service was off, wait staff couldn't explain the specials, vegetable side for one of the party was undercooked, for the  it was cold.  Table wasn't real clean , hot sauce bottle was slippery, silverware not clean, music too loud for enjoying a meal, (I don't like yelling at my dining companions). A lot of management wandering around, didn't seem to work well with their staff,  need to start working the tables and assist a poorly trained (though really nice) staff. They need to start paying attention and get this place up to speed. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED...

But mainly in the management.  We went to their 'Cigar Smoker / Xmas Party' this past Sunday.  Tickets were $30 each which I thought was a little steep but it included 2 cigars, 2 drafts, a Steelers half-time buffet and some raffle tickets.  Remember, this is a SEAFOOD restaurant.  What do you think they had on the buffet?  BBQ wings and some kind of ham swimming in juice, green beans & mashed potatoes...!  Where was the SEAFOOD?  Did they do this so people that LOVE to come here for their seafood AND the cigar bar are forced to buy it?  Their xmas gifts & raffle ticket prizes were nice but damn... where was the seafood...?  Shrimp, clams, oysters, hush puppies...?  :(

So- the reason for the 3 star review is that the ham was 'swimming' and didn't look appetizing AT ALL and the wings were only offered in ONE flavor without celery, carrots, ranch, blue cheese dressing...  I could have spent $60 at my regular cigar shop (Blooms on Carson) and had one hell of an evening.  

I hate to be a 'hater' in this review- check out my last one for here- 5 Stars- but this 'event' was just not up to par."}
{"text":"I have long been a customer of the original Wintzell's in Mobile Alabama, and look forward to my trips South, when I can belly up to the oyster bar and watch one of the guys who's been working there forever shuck oysters to order. And, while I'm not a fan of taking a concept that makes sense in one part of the country and transplanting to another part of the country where it makes no sense at all, I have to admit I was curious to see how they were doing at Wintzell's Pittsburgh. So we headed over for lunch today to see how it compared with the original.

Our first impression on arrival was a little bit of dread, as there were no customers. I do not like eating at seafood restaurants where the turnover of fresh fish and shell fish is slow. So I skipped the raw oysters, and normally I would eat a dozen (sometimes 2) by myself. I started with the fried green tomatoes with crawfish sauce, which is a regular thing that I order in Mobile. The fried tomatoes were very good...not greasy, and coated with a nice batter. The sauce fell short of the mark, however. Not enough sauce and not enough crawfish in the sauce. Which is what happens when you have to fly food in because it's not locally made, raised or caught...you either skimp on that product to keep food costs down, or you charge a lot for it. They skimped. 

The fried catfish/oyster combo that I ordered was good...the oysters were actually excellent. Not the best catfish that I've ever had, but I eat a lot of it between visits to Georgia, Alabama and Louisiana, so my bar is set very high. I thought they did a fairly good job with the fryer here, but if you've had fried food in the South...well, you'll understand. My partner ordered the red beans and rice (it's Monday, after all), with the intention to share our meals, but he ended up sending it back and ordering what I had. Not good, this red beans and rice. Overly salted and spiced, with not enough of the flavor of the beans coming through. I've never tried the red beans and rice in Mobile, so I can't say how it stacks up against the original. I like mine simpler, so it may just be a question of taste. 

Service was very good, if a bit rushed. Tracy was chatty and helpful, and we both enjoyed her company."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were very excited to see that an oyster themed southern restaraunt had made its way across the Mason Dixon to Pittsburgh! 

I love traveling through the south and eating oysters pretty much every day that I can, so Wintzell's, and Alabama chain was a welcome sight.

I expected it to be a small place about the size of a Long John Silvers, but this was quite an expansive location, a former Damons. The owners also put in an on site cigar bar, which I feel is a really nice touch.

The place was very crowded on a Friday night, so we waited about 20 minutes to be seated. Afterwards, it seemed there were some service mixups, and it took a little while to get our drinks, while we watched a server break a glass. Generally a restaurant of this type has more experienced waitstaff, as these were highschool kids. I am sure they will get over the early growing pains. The owner stopped by and was a nice guy to have a brief chat with.

We ordered half a dozen raw oysters, the oyster sampler, the blackened catfish dinner, and a cup of gumbo.

The raw oysters were high quality, and I believe the owner mentioned he has everything overnighted from suppliers in the bayou. The Witnzells hot sauce was really a treat and added a lot to the raw oysters. 

The sampler platter of oysters had Oysters Rockafeller, Savannah, and a few others. All were exceptional.

The blackened catfish was OK, it could have used a bit more of a crust of blackening season. I would probably get it fried next time. There are some great hush puppies that come with the meal to satisfy anyone's inner fat kid. 

We had a side of green beans, but they were painfully uninspired, my only real gripe. 

All and all, pretty decent. The prices are very reasonable for what you get, and we both left with our tummies satisfied."}
{"text":"Tried out Wintzell's on a Sunday at around 5, so I can't comment on service when they're really busy. Was greeted and seated promptly, and the dining area was half full. Started with a Bloody Mary $4 special that I ordered extra spicy. I had to add some hot sauce (had no spice), and think they forgot the vodka. Started the dininig with a cup of gumbo which I thought was delicious, and split an app of fried green tomatoes. The tomatoes were perfectly crisped, piping hot and drizzled with a delicious crawfish sauce. Not certain, but the sauce could easily have been the same gumbo.

Moved on to 1/2 dozen grilled oysters and another seasonal special, an appetizer-sized order of crawfish boil. Had never had oysters char-grilled before - only raw or fried. They were out of this world - not chewy at all, with an excellent sauce they describe as \"peppery butter, parmesan and tomato cheese.\" Didn't see any remnants of tomato, and distinctly tasted garlic, but whatever it was, they were delish! The crawfish were nicely spiced and an abundantly-sized order. All in all, can not knock anything I had.

My dining companion had a basket of fried shrimp and fish. Came with ample crispy fries and a couple of pepper-studded hush puppies. Looked fine, but I didn't sample.

Oh, and the waitress, Tracy, was very nice and busted her hump to please. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous! The best place to get oysters in Pittsburgh.We had fried oysters, the oyster sampler and the seafood au gratin. Everything was fantastic. Make sure to get some bread pudding for dessert. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Ugh. I really wanted to like this place!! I feel like even though there was issues I really tried to keep a positive attitude. It was the 4th of July and I want to have a good time. This place was trying to throw a monkey wrench in my plan. 

So it started off pretty good. Friendly hosted. Waitress came out right away ordered our drinks and took a look at the menu. When we ordered our food I also ordered a watermelon margarita. It literally took 15 min for the waitress to come back to the table!! When she did Bry asked about my drink the waitress said O let me see. 5 min later she brought me out a frozen margarita!! I ordered it on ice. So along came another waitress who saw our empty plates from our appetizer which I'll get into after this rant. Asked how it was told her my drink was wrong and she took the wrong one and brought out one on the rocks. It was also much stronger then the frozen one. Bry had also ordered a jack and coke and some lemonade drink. I don't know what it was because the place was pretty empty but it took (in my best Squint impersonation) FOREVER.   

Ok now onto the food. We had the jerk chicken chili nachos. They were pretty good but the bottom of the dish had a considerable amount of liquid. I chose the fried flounder dinner and it was really good. Didn't like the grits but the side salad and hush puppies were very good. The little man had a fish basket with french fries. He said it was delicious. His meal also came with a kids ice cream which made him one very happy boy. For dessert I had the better then your mamas chocolate cake and it was soooooo good. Really tho highlight of the meal. Bry had a piece of pineapple upside down cake. He didn't like it. It was dry and he didn't event finish it. 

Now onto my other rant. I had a groupon for this place and when I checked in I saw I got a free app for checking in so I thought way cool. So got an app. When I showed the waitress my free app and gave her my groupon she said I couldn't use both. Ok so nowhere in the grouoon did it say cannot be combined and they only let us use one thing. So whatever paid for the bill and won't be going back. Left wishing we had gone to red lobster which is right across the street. I won't bother with this place again."}
{"text":"Very good fried shrimp.  The shrimp were huge and fried to perfection.  Substituted the onion rings which were delicious!  The cole slaw was very tasty and fresh.  The entire dinner was very good.  Also had the blacken chicken Alfredo on the order, which was outstanding!  Very pleased with the food.  Our server, Tamara N was fantastic!  Very friendly and attentive!"}
{"text":"Shared a dozen oysters on the half shell and then had the blackened shrimp salad for my meal. The oysters were gigantic, but were lacking in taste. Shrimp salad was pretty decent, but on the small side."}
{"text":"Wintzells is a HUGE chain in the South, these restaurants are all through Alabama and Mississippi, and for some reason their only Northern restaurant is in Pittsburgh.

This is a FANTASTIC restaurant in the wrong location.  I'm afraid this place is going to close because its never busy when we dine here and quite frankly it should be packed!

If you love seafood, take a drive down 51 South and try this place!

They even occasionally have groupons.  You've got to try this place.  The broiled seafood platter is my absolute favorite dinner.  Oysters, oh.my.god. OYSTERS

I will only eat Oysters here, or at Luke Wholleys Wild Alaskan Grill.  They are fantastic.  And the hush puppies...dear god. 

All the food here is very fresh, and excellent.  It's NOT cheap, but do you really want discount seafood?

Ge the Groupon and give this place a try!  its so good, and I just had to spread the word."}
{"text":"If you follow my reviews, you will see that I rarely review places that I can't give a great 4 or 5 star rating for.  I really wish the best for small business having been a local business owner that failed due to difficult times.  It is also noteworthy to mention that I love seafood and was excited to see that Wintzells, a big name in the South was coming home to where the owners roots are.  Having the one and only choice for seafood being the overcrowded Red Lobster, the place where the elderly, people of Walmart go for lunch, I welcomed any restaurant that would even come close to providing a real seafood experience to Pleasant Hills and the South Hills of Pittsburgh.  To be fair, I visited Wintzells for lunch twice prior to this experience, was not happy with the service, the lack of internet service, and the fair to be kind quality of the food.  Also to be fair, this location, although close to Rt. 51, is tucked back away from the highway and not easily seen from the road, and has always been a fail for previous business ventures.  This night, my wife who hates seafood was out shopping with my daughter and that left me and my son to fend for ourself.  The go to restaurant would have been Red Lobster as we love the mediocre seafood entr√©es, lobster biscuits, salad, lobster, crab, etc.  But tonight, we said, lets give Wintzells a try.  From the moment we walked in, it was doomed but stay tuned because my food review may surprise you.  The atmosphere is just blank, there are high school kids pretending to clean  and keep busy all over the place, its 5:30 and nobody is there.  The bar is impressive and yes the cigar room is great if you smoke cigars. I ordered the broiled seafood platter, oysters, scallops, fish, and shrimp.  The shrimp and scallops were great, as was the fish.  But if you are going for seafood, beware.  This is an Oyster House and the Oysters are ok at best.  I mean how bad can they be when the slimy creatures are covered in every seasoning available to mankind.  There was so much seasoning on them they were crunchie, not slimy.  I went there for lobster and crab.  They said they don't have lobster except on holidays.  Give me a break, is this a seafood restaurant or not.  They did have an entr√©e called stuffed crab.  I asked what it was and the waitress said \" Oh you don't want that!  It is just a deli type stuffed crab.... people complain about it all the time here.\"  Ok, why is it still on the menu and why do you not have crab legs and lobster?  Everything else on the menu other than what I ordered is fried.  My salad had frozen, yes frozen cucumbers on it, wilted like dead flowers which I immediately cast off to the side with the awful coleslaw.   I have to say though, there was one major improvement that I noticed from my past lunch experiences.... they have complimentary Wi-FI service so you can easily leave bad Yelp reviews right from the table.  You know, this hurts me as I really wanted this place to thrive, but unless they get with it real soon, or begin bringing in bus loads of the the people of Walmart very soon, it like all of the other attempts at this location will fail miserably.  I for one will not be back unless I see many future Yelpers raving about the great new things they have done or if I get a call from J.O. Wintzell himself asking for my input on how to make a go in his home town of Pleasant Hills where I have lived for 55 years and never left.  For now though, I will reluctantly go back to Red Lobster with the rest of the cheap, people who are challenged in so many ways, with my tail between my legs, just to get a lobster tail whether it be cooked properly or not.  It's all ok though because their cucumbers are crisp and fresh, and their lobster muffins are awesome when they are warm!  You just have to pretend that the people around you have other clothing than the multi-stained elastic pull ups that they are usually wearing.  You just have to close your eyes, enjoy the lobster, and imagine that you are sitting at Wintzells."}
{"text":"This is quite an interesting place. A chain of locations all throughout Alabama, and the only one outside the state is in Pittsburgh. I'm left wondering if there's a story behind this, but I sure am happy that it's here.

Service is friendly, and they present you with a slew of menus (appetizers, lunch, drinks, seasonal, and probably more I forgot) at the table. The lunch prices are very reasonable, and we tried the junior J.O. platter, which also came with a side. Each of the fried items (fish, shrimp, oyster) was great--crispy, flavorful, not too greasy. There were also a couple of hush puppies on the platter, which were equally good. The sides of cheese and grits was a nice complement (perhaps a bit bland), and we tacked on an extra gumbo soup, which came with plenty of seafood on its own. Definitely worth making the trek out of the city!"}
{"text":"This is letter I sent to the email address on website. 
I just left your place after dinner with my son and his godfather. The food quality was phenomenal. Zero complaints there. Our waitress, Olivia, was good as well. Checking on us constantly and getting whatever we may have needed. That's where my raves and good reviews end. The wait to be seated was terrible. Not only did we wait for over 30 minutes, we were passed over by several parties of 2, whom once we were seated, observed most sitting at tables for 4, which would have been way more suited for our party of 3 instead of being crammed in a booth. The wait time for food was unreal. Yes, it was busy, I understand this. But when tables that were seated after you are constantly getting there orders before ours, something is wrong. It was at least a half hour or longer from time of appetizer to time out main course came. As a seafood aficionado, I am pleased a place like this is here. But the problems that I encountered tonight surely need addressed and changed for the better of business. Any questions or comments, please feel free to email me."}
{"text":"Made a return trip to Wintzell's & will never go back.

Ordered the Catch of the Day. The day we went, it was walleye. What I received WAS NOT walleye. It also had too many bones & ; sadly enough, scales. The bones I don't like, but are somewhat understandable. But SCALES? If the cook couldn't see the scales, he doesn't deserve to have a job as a cook.

Management was pretty good about it, but not good enough for my liking.

If it comes down to eating at Wintzell's or starving to death, I'l start making funeral arrangements."}
{"text":"The oysters (we had them deep fried and grilled) were pretty good, but what I really liked was the Broiled Seafood Platter I had. It was so big, Darren had to help me finish it. You get a platter of fish, oysters, shrimp and scallops that one can easily share. Dessert was the Better Than Your Mama's Chocolate Cake, and it was dynamite. The decor is quirky and has an old-time southern charm to it (I wished it wasn't so gloomy in there, though. They needed more light). Our server Nikki (Nicole K) was an adorable sweetiepie. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Good food - really nice bar area - friendly staff. Need to change music! 1970's disco in an Alabama raw bar atmosphere??"}
{"text":"First time visit after a recommendation from a family member.  We stopped for lunch and got loads of attention from our server since there was only one other table of patrons.   I had the jerk chicken nachos, which were tasty, but odd.   The nachos were layered on the plate and soaked with all the toppings, so you had to use a knife and fork to eat them.   The ones on the very bottom in the middle were just overly soggy.   My husband had the clam chowder which he really liked, but the jambalaya special of the day was super dry and very disappointing.

The atmosphere is very cute and the place is huge.   The bar is very sports oriented and would be a great place to watch games.   There is a cigar bar, only open at night, which looked like a nice place.

We may have ordered the wrong items, not sure, may be willing to give it another chance."}
{"text":"The first time we went the food, drinks, and service were great! We liked it so much we took our friends for a night out. Although the waiter was attentive, he was also the bartender - our drinks weren't filled and the food was just OK. I'd say it's worth a try, then make up your mind. Like I said the first time was good!"}
{"text":"Visited with friends last night. First time there for me. I really like oysters, so when a friend suggested going, I immediately agreed. I liked everything about the place. There were 5 of us dining, which we did at the bar. The bar tender was caring and knowledgeable.  Everything we ordered was great and tasty. The oysters were fresh, fish, scallops and shrimp were prepared and cooked perfectly. Prices were pretty good too. I've eaten at more expensive restaurants and although their atmosphere was more upscale, service and food couldn't match up to the experience at Wintzell's. Will suggest to others and look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"This is a tough review for me to write.  I'm a huge fan of the Wintzell's in Mobile AL.  I've been there several times. Maybe it's like going to a reggae bar and drinking Red Stripe in Nebraska, it's just not the same as if you were on the beach in Jamaica.  The place itself is cool and has the same decor and vibe.  The menu is mostly the same but there are some notable differences.  There are some cajun specialties left off the Pittsburgh menu.  The service was very good but we were the only table there at noon on Monday.  

I ordered the fried green tomatoes.  They were delicious but the crawfish sauce wasn't the same.  It just wasn't as good.  It didn't look the same and it didn't taste the same.  I don't want to know why.  Next came the red beans and rice with sausage and chicken, house salad starter.  It was absolutely inedible.  It was buried in blackened spices and salt and you couldn't taste anything else.  The chicken was pretty good.  Red beans are simple.  Trinity, beans, tasso and maybe a little bit of cajun seasonings but really the tasso should do it.  You serve this with some sausage or even better a pork chop and I am ready!  I haven't ordered this in Mobile so maybe that's the way they make it there but I seriously doubt it.  I've eaten this dish countless times and this wasn't it by any stretch of the imagination.  I sent it back.

I ordered 1/2 and 1/2 oysters and fish with hush puppies and slaw.  The oysters were excellent and the saving grace of this review.  Crispy, not greasy, delicious with their house sauce and Tobasco.  The fish was ok.  Maybe a little soggy greasy but not bad.  The slaw was good.  It was ok overall.  I might have enjoyed it more if I hadn't been so disappointed with the beans.  

I'm not a big fan of chains.  You can't really replicate them unless you make some compromises along the way.  A restaurant is only as good as it's team as well and great food is in the details.  I would try it again."}
{"text":"As a southerner I was excited to try this restaurant. We were greeted by a very friendly young woman. We went on a Monday night and the restaurant was about a third full. I ordered the fried catfish with fried okra and cheese grits. It was beyond my expectations. It was southern food at it's best. I usually have to wait until I visit my family in the south to get this kind of food. My husband ordered the low country boil. The shrimp were huge and the sausage had a little kick to it. He ate and loved every bite. Our waitress Lori Ann was very attentive and extremely friendly. I have already posted on Facebook how great the restaurant is so my friends will all try it."}
{"text":"Came in Friday with a big party of 18. The service was nice & friendly, food took a little long but was excellent & worth the wait. Management was great with our group. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"As I have mentioned before, I am a fool for oysters, particularly of the deep-fried kind.  Having reiterated that for the umpteenth time, when my ever-watchful mother mentioned to me that an oyster-specialty restaurant had opened minutes from Century III Mall, I knew I had to clear a space in my schedule to have lunch or dinner there, even if it was a chain that had just recently made inroads up North. 

Carefully made to look authentic and non-corporate, odd, olden decor is at the fore. Lifesavers and worn signs with homespun sayings inhabit the walls of the dining room, which was strangely dark and calm just before the Sunday church/Steeler crowd rush. 

Kay and I became wonderfully acquainted with our adorable, sharp, attentive, and effervescent server Nikki (a.k.a. Nicole K) as we in partook in mollusks that were cooked in hot fat and over naked flames. 

6 Char-Grilled Oysters began our late-morning Gulf Coast feast, peppered butter, parmesan, and romano topping each igneous half-shell. Slippery oysters evanesced in my mouth with no elasticity or grit detected, the dairy products imparting their rich flavors upon them along with that of the raw fire, the seawater essence never losing out. 

Next came a helping of their 3/4-of-a-century-old trademark: Fried oysters accompanied by a saucerful of a creamy, crunchy, and thus, model cole slaw and a behemoth of a flawless baked potato \"loaded\" with all the trademark fixings.  

If I had to concoct a couple of complaints, it would be that there was nothing to dip the fried oysters in (an aioli or remoulade would have been apropos) and that I almost felt that the serving was stingy. It seemed unfair that the pile of slimy, juicy, humid bivalves encased in crunchy breading wasn't more substantial. Perhaps selfishness and gluttony and are to blame for my minor disenchantment.

My ravenous stomach would be remedied (enabled?) by Kay, however, as she couldn't complete her J.O. Broiled Seafood Platter. Fish, shrimp, scallops, clams arrived on a silver-coated SHIELD Helicarrier of a tray. Every piece of sea creature was supple, bleeding with flavor, exuberantly spiced with that staple of oceanfront kitchens: Old Bay. 

With a pocket of room left for a sweet finale, we both ordered the BTYM Chocolate Cake. BYTM stands for \"Better Than Your Mama's,\" a challenge if there ever was one. Iced with a buttercream frosting that roofs a fudge-sodden interior, the cake is served warm with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. Eh, I'd wager on my Mama on any given day on any given dish, but this game would have me chewing my nails and perspiring. Think of it as a heated Oakmont Bakery birthday cake with ice cream sans the candle and corny singalong. 

J. Oliver Wintzell, the franchise's founder, was surely an interesting fellow if his proudly displayed words of wisdom tell us anything about him. He's left quite a legacy, one gastronauts of the Pittsburgh area can now experience for themselves. Nothing smacked of flash-frozen or processed trash. Everything tasted fresh and hand-made. No \"flair\" or caffeinated, contrived enthusiasm was encountered. Rather, only down-to-earth folk  work here and work very hard to please you while exuding a quiet confidence that they'll be filling every table and booth very soon. 

Thanks be to J.O.W. and the Alabama town that produced him. Long John Silver is about to walk the plank. His days of piracy and fast-food fraud are through.

P.S. The service was smooth overall. Whatever bugs this Wintzell's had when it first went live were gone by the time we got around to visiting."}
{"text":"Had an occasion to be in Pittsburgh visiting family and my mother in law suggested this place. Having looked at the menu before arriving we thought we knew what we were getting into...reality was much different.  The place has a dive feel to it, not bad but unexpected.  Our waitress was very direct and kind of \"in our faces\" almost immediately.  My mother in law had trouble le reading the menu as the interior is a bit dark. We ordered drinks and had several questions. They were answered but it was like pulling teeth. My wife and I ordered appetizers. Hers was a crab cake and I had the fried green  beans. Both were good however we were half way through them when our salads arrived. We were half way through the salads when our entrees arrived. They weren't that busy so I don't know what the rush was. My wife had salmon, which she said was ggod. My mother in law had the fried stuffed crabs which were suppose to be a portion of 3..only 2 were on the plate. She found the fried green tomatoes inedible. I ordered a rib eye but they didn't have that and switched to the strip steak. It was okay. We ordered a bread pudding and key lime pie for dessert. The pudding was ok but my Poe was the highlight of the meal. Was it my worst dining experience,  no. Would I come back. No. The waitresses are all pretty loud and this place is more suited to a happy hour place not a fine dining experience. Most of the fish dishes are fried but we did discover they will grill some items."}
{"text":"I am one of the few people who love this location because I am nearby.  I have been there 3 or 4 times and keep ordering less and less food because their food is lousy.
I will still go back to order beer and garlic chicken wings to watch sports at the bar. This is a very nice cheap date in great ambiance for that. 
Service is slow but with good conversation and a game to watch who cares?  
They need a serious overhaul of their menu, how they make things, and how long it takes to get it. Forget frozen drinks and stick with Beer.
 Enjoy the place when you are not hungry.  I will be back - keep hoping the place with improve.
ps. Looks like the place is closed. Sure hope they get a better place in there."}
{"text":"i've been here for lunch twice and enjoyed each occasion, both for groupon deals, so keep your eyes out. Their raw oysters are above average to great.. i've never eaten premiere oysters, so I don't really know better. The side dishes/ salads are fair sized and tasty. Draft beer selection is good.. maybe 8 on tap, half domestic/lame/cheap and the other half are widely available crafts - Harpoon, Southern Tier, Penn... that variety. I'll continue to eat here - maybe more frequently.

Niche Demographic Con - its not a health food place, lots of deep fried stuff, starches, meats/fish etc.. so plan on getting all stuffed and slimed up!  In A Good Way"}
