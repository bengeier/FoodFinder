{"text":"Our first time in and we enjoyed the sweet potato scramble with bacon and beautiful tomato soup. A friendly and well run joint. Looking forward to using the outside tables in warmer weather. Particularly appreciative of the hellos and goodbyes. I miss that kindness at most other places."}
{"text":"My fiancee and I came here for lunch one day and got an egg scramble that was to die for! They also had this fabulous little drink that I think was Goji or something, but you can get it hot or cold. We got both and they were both delicious. I haven't stopped thinking about this place and I can't wait to go back. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cute little organic breakfast spot and quasi boutique in Bainbridge. The goods are spanning pottery and soaps and some jewelry, and all are on par with other artisanal goods in the area. The food is good but a bit pricey. Staff is super friendly and atmosphere is calm and peaceful. Nice place ."}
{"text":"everything about this place is amazing. not only is the food fabulous but they are actually making a change in this world giving these people with disabilities a real chance at having a job. the owners are always so friendly and personable it really makes a difference. the food that they make is always so fresh and tasty and comes from great sources like the cattle ranch where they raise the beef for the burgers and meatballs to the organic farms where they get the produce to make all of these delicious items on the menu. it is truly a gem of bainbridge."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! Not only is their food delicious, their staff is very friendly and helpful. Their mission to train and employ people with exceptionalities is very near and dear to my heart and they do a wonderful job with it. I think what they are doing is tremendous!! The staff was attentive and very helpful.

My husband and I both had the egg scramble with sweet potato hash. It was to die for! Perfectly seasoned and delicious. They have vegan, gluten free and vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out since it opened. I ordered the grilled cheese with sundried tomato pesto + the creamy tomato soup and it was delicious. My mom got the tuna melt-- it was fresh, light and different than your average melt. Healthy and organic clean eating that you can really taste. Plus I can't help but admire and support this company's work with the Two Foundation."}

{"text":"This place is incredible! The decor is amazing and the food and service were outstanding. I was just visiting Chagrin for the weekend but will definitely be back. The owners are so friendly and the mission of this restaurant is refreshing. Everything was top notch with fresh, organic ingredients! We will be back next time we are in town."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I wanted my tastebuds to exploded with love. Truthfully though, the food was not that good. Every single item ordered I've had better elsewhere and was pretty unspectacular. The menu choices are very limited. The cost is a bit high. I would go back simply because it is a good cause to support. Maybe not for food though... The coffee was decent!

I feel like I'm missing out on something. Everybody before my review is listing the delicious food they ordered, none of which were on the menu when I went. Perhaps I went at an off-season time."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my wife there this afternoon. We both had the Salad, she had salmon on it and I had chicken. I am happy to report that both salads were amazing. All vegetables were fresh and tasty, the proteins were cooked perfectly.
The staff is extremely attentive and professional. This place is spotless clean and well decorative."}
{"text":"I haven't even finished my sandwich yet. This place is awesome. It reminds me of home and my mother. The grilled cheese with tomato, basil, and arugula is having a party in my mouth rn. The only place around here, that I know of, that actually makes it part of their mission to use nutritious, delicious and LOCAL ingredients."}
{"text":"Two Cafe features organic, healthy menu items. The food is delicious, and the bright, clean interior makes it a nice option for breakfast, lunch or an early dinner."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant. Food, service, atmosphere, and mission are all fantastic. Especially love the sweet potato hash. Highly recommend for breakfast, lunch, or a cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Quaint cafe at the NE corner of Washington St. and 306. Order at the counter, and be served at your table. Large variety of farm to table foods that are vegetarian and gluten free. Apps, salads, sandwiches. I had the honey salmon entree with garlic and berry quinoa. Delicious. The green smoothie tasted very earthy with ginger and yogurt. Everyone enjoyed their meal. Good service. Any tip donations go toward a van service. Free trade coffees, too. Check it out!"}
