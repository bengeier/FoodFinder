{"text":"This place was quite disappointing. Service was bad and the food was overpriced, not to mention the quality was just meh. 
Their brick toasts are nothing but a gimmick and are basically bread soaked in oily sauce."}
{"text":"NOTE: This place has new management now!!
Just had an unhappy experience tonight:
Waiter delivered the wrong fish dish to our table (there was a fish dish in the combo that we ordered) and we had a bite.
Waiter came by, didn't take it back, and then at check out, an extra $20 was added to the bill for the fish that I didn't order... we were not informed that it was $20 at all and didn't agree to it!
Food portion was small for an $82 combo ... would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great clean place for dim sum! $3.20 per dish before 11am on weekdays, and the menu extends after 11, as it gets pricey then! 

There is always a crowd, even on weekdays, and after 11, so be sure to get there early! 
On the menu, they mark their specialty dishes by using purple ink! 

Notable specials include their mango mochi and their BBQ pork bun with a crispy top! 

There is free wifi, and the password is on every table, which is a really nice addition on top of their already good service and cleanliness!"}
{"text":"There's an eye popping amount of dishes in their menu,  most that I've never heard of before, probably of their own creation.  I tried a soup and rice dish.  It was tasty,  but very heavy on the MSG"}
{"text":"Ordered BBQ takeout from the place. They no longer have it outside by the cashier, so it was prepared (cut) inside.

My pound of bbq pork turned out more like half a pound when I opened it at home and my marinated duck had the roasted duck plum sauce included instead :("}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant three times. The first experience was great. The second experience was acceptable, but the last was very poor and left me not wanting to return again.

The restaurant is quite large and the decor is modern. At our first dining experience, ten of us were seated at a table with half-height partition around the table which provided a bit of privacy. Both the food and the service were great. At our second visit, four of us were having lunch. The food was not as good as dinner but the portions were quite large. The service was not good but acceptable. 

Our third visit was a very negative experience because the customer service was lacking. Specifically, the waitress was very rude and her facial expressions seemed to suggest that she didn't feel like serving us. When we asked her questions, she looked away and seemed to be irritated that we were asking questions about the menu. Her responses were not particularly helpful. When we indicated that we wanted to order take out after our meal, she seemed to roll her eyes. We were so frustrated that we decided not to proceed with ordering take out after our meal since it seemed to be such a hassle for the waitress. For lunch, we ordered a bowl of noodles and a dish of fried rice with pumpkin. The noodles were quite good but the fried rice was too sweet for my taste. It almost tasted like a lot of sugar was added to the dish.  It was unfortunate that we experienced such poor customer service because the atmosphere of the restaurant was really nice. I recognized the waitress because she served us on all 3 visits so perhaps she was having an off day. However, given my last experience, I don't think I would go back again."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Could use more servers, but the ones working are very efficient. Food is typical for a Chinese  congee place. I did like that they cut their noodles to make it easier to eat. Prices are on the higher side but not unreasonable."}
{"text":"i was all set to have a new favourite chinese restaurant to take my grandparents to, since it's literally steps away from their condo, but then the food poisoning symptoms set in for my mother.

walking in, we were all super impressed. hugely spacious, neat and modern, helpful staff with glowing nametags (??), and clean washrooms. the food was really great (the beef with gai lan was really tender, the free range chicken almost fell off the lil bones, and the beef brisket was super yummy with generous portions of tendon), and the mango tapioca at the end was perf. HOWEVER

at the beginning of the meal they brought us a hot plate to keep the pork bone soup warm. nobody else in my family really likes soup, except for my mom, so my sister and i had like a third of a bowl each and my mom had at least two bowls on her own. my dad was joking around like, \"i bet they have to keep the soup hot for safety inspections,\" and that was like a big ol' jinx because about 10 minutes after we left, my mom started sweating BUCKETS.

she spent the rest of the car ride home almost curled up in a ball in the car, dry heaving a little, with sweat pouring off every single part of her. she would have made a mad dash for the washroom as soon as we got home, only she was too weak to be able to move very quickly. currently she is lying on the plushiest rug we have, covered in a blanket, with a hot pack over her lower back. that's the same thing i do whenever i accidentally eat something containing nuts, only it's worse for my mom because she's not in the prime of her youth and is already exhausted on a day to day basis.

so. in conclusion. this is hugely disappointing. the fact that they brought hot plates to keep the soup warm (which is the first time i've seen something like this in a chinese restaurant, whether banquet or casual? at first i thought it was a new trend but if this is an indicator that they've run into similar problems before...) -- this should have made us all as suspicious as my father. my mom was the only one who really dug into the soup & the bones, and now she's half napping half whimpering on the floor. it's kind of cute but also super sad."}
{"text":"Nice decoration, and variety of food.
Tried baked rice with pork chop servee in bread loaf,
Made me so full.
Will try the tea time when in the area."}
{"text":"Appears this restaurant has changed owners or under new Mgmt. English name is still My Wonderful Kitchen but Chinese name is different.

The interior has been nicely renovated... modern, more upscale and clean. 

Dinner menu is also totally different.  No longer serving HK cafe style meals, the menu consist of more upscale but traditional Chinese dishes and set menus with prices to match.  We ordered many dishes to sample including lemon chicken, fried beans with shredded pork, Angus beef cubes with asparagus in garlic sauce, tofu with vegetables, Cantonese chow mien and fried rice.  All dishes were nicely presented and portion sizes were good...  all very tasty as well.  I especially liked the Angus beef... meat was super tender and flavourful.

We asked for some glasses of water and were brought bottled Nestle water at no charge which was a surprise.

Complimentary dessert consisting of red bean soup and almond cookies was served.

All staff were friendly and attentive. 

Free wifi offered.

Overall a good experience and meal.  Will be back."}
{"text":"I just notice this place last night so I gave it a try.
I ordered combo for two which included 1) Fried Egg with Shrimp & Noodle Fish [???????] and 2) Chicken with Pumpkin in Coconut sauce [?????] $24.99
The restaurant is very nice, and lot of space between tables (which is uncommon for a Chinese restaurant)
I like the fried egg but not the chicken. The sauce for the chicken is good, but there are hardly any meat there, mostly bone.
This place is ok, but I probably won't go back as I don't get the value for my food for the $ I paid."}
{"text":"Delicious dim sum at reasonable prices. Before 11am most dishes are $3.20 but you have to pay in cash. Recommend the seafood dumpling in soup and the baked bbq pork buns. The mango mochi is very popular judging by tables nearby."}
{"text":"Our second time here for dim sum with the family, lunch on a Saturday. Really nice modern decor and very clean. 
We ordered a few dishes: BBQ pork w/ rice+broccoli, baked BBQ pork bun pastry, steamed spare ribs, pan fried turnip cake among a few others. Both my 6yo and 4yo love the bbq pork here. Service is quick and the food is very good in terms of quality and portions. We've tried a few different steamed rice rolls: the shrimp & veggie, steamed bbq pork and the plain ones. 
Was told the restaurant is quite busy and has been full both times we've been here but doesn't feel overcrowded which is nice. Good place to bring the kids as you don't need to worry about noise level!"}
{"text":"First takeout order, went there after 15 mins (as was told by staff), had to wait 30 mins longer for the food. It was not busy at all. Don't remember what I ordered, but I remember disliking it and throwing it out.

2nd takeout order, went there because I thought they accepted credit/debit. But their machine was not working. Asked how long it has not been working, they said they didn't know (so I am guessing it's been awhile). Had to go to the bank and pay $2 fee to get cash, should have just refused the food.

Usually if the food is good, I disregard bad service. But when a transaction as simple as a takeout order becomes extremely stressful, then it seriously is not worth the trouble. 

They seem to prioritize customers that eat-in, so maybe that is better. But I personally will never go back again.

Cash only."}
{"text":"I don't frequent HK diners often so my standards might not be that high...
That being said, I really liked some dishes and thought some were just okay.
The french toast w/ condensed milk which is normally my fave food at these places was just okay. It came in bite size pieces. And was not served with enough condensed milk. It seemed to be missing something.

The XO fried rice noodle was also somewhat bland.

The steak with mustard sauce was a winner though. And the bolognese baked spaghetti was also good. 

The decor is very nice here, it looks clean and new."}
{"text":"It was strange with the entrance as the side facing Highway 7 appeared to be the main doors but it wasn't.  The main entrance was on the backside of the building close to where the mid-rise buildings are (away from Hwy 7).

There were so many items on the menu that we wanted to try.  Some were good and some were disappointing.  We ordered some menu items based on pictures we saw from Yelp as well.

Red Bean Milk - Our did not look like the pictures on Yelp, the ice was crushed ice and not the red bean ice like pictures.  The straw was regular straws, so you can't get to the red bean unless you use a spoon.  :(  When asked the manager for a bigger straw, they said that they ordered them but they still haven't arrived yet.

Pork Stomach with White Pepper Soup - Wow... it was so much white pepper, I took my first sip and chocked.  Don't get me wrong, I absolutely LOVE pepper, but this was to a point where it's not enjoyable.  It felt like someone was pouring pepper and the entire pepper bottle slipped out of their hands and into the soup.  :(  Disappointment here.

Seafood Chow Mein - This one was pretty good, but had some shrimp shells in it...  Not sure why.. Other than that, it was good.  :)  Interesting combination of the 2 noodles (chow mein and vermicelli).

Garlic Tofu with scallop - Loved this dish cause there was so much garlic.  :)  Nice simple steamed dish.

Yellow Curry in bread bowl - Curry was a bit spicy for our taste.  Maybe my taste buds were a bit shot from the soup earlier.  Will definitely try again next time.

Baked Portuguese Chicken with rice - Nice and creamy, full of coconut flavor if you love coconut.  Chicken was still crispy even after it was baked.  :D

Service - SUPER SLOW.  Sometimes we felt like the wait staff saw us flagging them down and just ignored us.  We asked multiple servers for water and it probably took us 3 tries to get a glass of water.  The drink we ordered afterwards didn't show up and we had to ask them to put in the order again.  They definitely need more attentive staff or just more wait staff.

Decor was nice, felt clean.  But the booths facing Hwy 7 at the end of the restaurant had AC blasting the entire time.  It was quite cold while we were eating.

Overall, food was pretty good, but service killed it.  Will give it an average 3 stars and come back for attempt # 2 to see if there will be a difference.  Love how they did the front waiting area to keep the kids occupy if you ever have to wait for a seat.  :) There were tablets and a gaming console to keep them entertained.

Comes with free dessert.  :)  Mini dessert cup of mango tapioca."}
{"text":"Ate in the main dining area. Had the baked spaghetti and chicken in tomato sauce - 5/5 stars, and the beef tripe vermicelli, 4.5/5 stars. Tasty and inexpensive. Would recommend."}
{"text":"Don't Bother ! Consider the location is Richmond Hill and there are tons of other choices for decent Chinese food. Prices here are relatively cheap, so-so food. Location is quite good( big and spacious, wait but only 1 person working on the floor, rest hiding somewhere )We got a grumpy waitress- told us off for taking more than 1 menu ( there were 3 of us ). Not a good start. Then the food never came... had to follow up... and when I asked if they had forgotten the order, she was very upset with us. Yeah, seriously..."}
{"text":"Entrance to the restaurant was confusing. The service was poor and slow some servers lacking in communication since they only speak Mandarin. The portions were small for stir fried noodles and was also small for the plate of vegetables. After going through a few dishes we ordered and finished eating, we were missing fried rice and seafood congee. The fried rice didn't come out until 15 mins after and the seafood congee never made it out at all so we cancelled. Overall, not a good first time experience and food was mediocre."}
{"text":"Worst place ever, the food in the picture didn't transform into anywhere alike in reality. The taste was off, and the appearance was okay, nothing special. The service was hard to get."}
{"text":"It's ok but a lot of choices. Staff are attentive. Need to eat here more before I can actually give an educated review."}
{"text":"My family and I always come here for lunch and dinner. Their dishes are delicious and with a reasonable price. This place is also really tidy and clean which I think it's really important for a restaurant. I recommend their noodles lunch menu, you get to pick your booth, type of noodles and toppings, they come in large bowl so it's totally worth it! I don't really have anything to recommend for dinner dish because all their dishes are great, baked pork with fried rice in a bread bowl is fantastic!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

We tried the chicken with pepper sauce in brick bread, the pepper sauce was good, very peppery; chicken was was a bit salty & dry.  The brick bread was deep fried so it tasted like Chinese oil stick ??? which made the dish super filling.  It was a great idea with good presentation.  

We also tried chicken congee with egg white... I guess they used the same seasoning to marinated their chicken because it tasted the same as above chicken dish.  I didn't expect a salty chicken in congee to be honest with u.  When I ordered congee, I wanted it light with a hint of salt only... This is just my personal preference.  

We also ordered rice in hot pot; it took over 20 mins to prepare the dish as warned by the waiter so we had no complain about the wait time.  Hm... I don't think they cooked the rice/dish directly in the clay pot because there was no charred burned rice at the bottom?!?  Steamed may be... I don't know...may be some people would like it because it was light, healthier & less oily.  But if u expected to eat charred burned rice at the bottom of the clay pot; u would be disappointed.  

We also tried street eat steamed rice noodle rolls ????.  It was good if they gave a bit more sesame sauce.  You have to eat this fast, once it was cold, the rice noodle rolls would be harder.  It was great to eat it when it was still steamy hot.  Just a little note, the soy sauce was at the bottom so stir them  before u eat.  
 
The restaurant was clean and bright.  Most of their wait staff have a big LED name tags lol first time to see it :). Customer service was good too

For sure, I will go back to try some more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Came for dimsum with a huge group. Made reservations. Great service. Food came out piping hot. Portions were bigger than other dimsum places. Nice and clean inside."}
{"text":"My friends and I are regulars. The restaurant manager is very accommodating and the service is great. One of the best Chinese restaurants in Toronto. The food is diligently made and so fine, unlike in other restaurants that seem too commercialized. My favourite would be the glutinous rice stuffed chicken! This place is definitely worth going back!"}
{"text":"Interesting place. Didn't try their bread dishes but the look really good. Prices seem quite reasonable and the meat with noodle was average."}
{"text":"Their weekday dim sum specials are as follows: From 8:30 am to 11:00 am, S/M/L are $3.20 per dish. Tea is $1.80 per person.  Upon entering, the first thing that strikes you is the thought they spent on decor.  Unlike other high end dim sum wannabees in the area, it is not garishly decorated. The second thing you notice is the service staff are customer friendly and are happy to be of assistance.  Most of the dim sum dishes (i.e. siu mai, fried seaweed rolls, seafood dumpling in soup, shrimp rice roll, etc) are good.  Surprisingly, the disappointment came from their signature baked bbq buns, on both texture and taste. The dough was too soft to hold its shape.  One of the buns was already partially deflated upon reaching our table.  As soon as you hold it, it collapses.  It feels too soft and soggy upon biting into it.  As for taste, it is too sweet, not very savoury, and absent of bbq pork flavor.  Too bad."}
{"text":"I came with my family for dimsum. As it was Easter Monday, there was no special discount on the dimsum prices (which is roughly $3 for most sizes on weekdays). We didn't order too much as the prices range from $3 to $9, which was a daunting price for dimsum. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the portions of the dishes. As a reference, the beef balls here come in four (usually three in most places) and each were almost the size of a fist. 

The dish that stood out from the rest were the Mango Mochi. They come on a dish with dry ice, giving a traditional Chinese mountain kind of vibe. Aesthetic-wise, it was the most impressing thing I've seen at dimsum in a long time. However, the taste of the Mochi was definitely lacking; it was filled mainly with cream that overwhelmed the mango chunks and it would have been much better colder. 

Overall, I would definitely consider coming back on a weekday when the dishes are at the special price."}
{"text":"Did they change owners?  Cause the menu was completely different. 3 stars for normal Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place should really be called My Interesting Kitchen. 

They have interesting menu items for sure, like a curry served in the middle of a piece of thick toast (the core is removed so that only the crust remains to hold the curry inside).  Or honey & black pepper fried oysters, served on little slices of bread.  

The dishes have cute names, too, like the \"Brokenhearted Pork Chops\".  

The issue I had was in the execution: everything was oddly bland.  Oddly, you say?  The salted egg yolk-covered, fried fish balls were mushy on the inside - I suspect they were simply boiled in hot water for a very long time.  The salted egg yolks were weirdly barely salty.  

The only item that really tasted of anything was the beef curry, which tasted of spiciness (I'd say a 5/10 spicy factor) but not much else. 

The HK milk tea and honey lemon iced tea were also very bland and watered down. 

In brutal honesty, it feels like the chef has never actually sampled their own dishes before serving it.  Which is too bad, because I think this place has potential.  Maybe that's why the pork chop has a broken heart..."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times. The waiters service our food really slow every time I go there. The food taste great though... BEWARE of the washroom, the entire washroom floor is really greasy and slippery!!!"}
{"text":"Had dim sum here. The dim sum are not bad but their fried rice is really bad. It's too wet and tasteless and it's quite expensive for the dish. Not sure if it would be better for dinner time. However, the service is not bad as they are quite attentive."}
{"text":"Came on a Wednesday night and it became much busier than expected as the night went on. Prices aren't cheap here but they have a couple of options for set menus -- we opted for the combo for 4, which easily could've fed 5. Portions are generous.

- 2 TYPES OF BBQ PLATTER: not bad but I've had better BBQ pork and duck at grocery stores/chinese BBQ joints
- WHOLE FISH: tender but the veggies it was served with were very bland.
- SOUP: presumably what the above fish and veggies were cooked in. Super milky, delicious.
-  CURRY CRAB WITH NAAN: curry was SWEET. and not in a good way. It's as if they added sugar when they meant to add salt. Instead of having the dish taken back, we asked the manager to take a spoonful to taste and confirm whether it was actually supposed to taste that sweet. He took the spoon to the kitchen and once he emerged, acted as if nothing happened at all, even after walking by and checking on our table multiple times. Umm..??? When pressed, he explained it was indeed to taste that way. There was a lot of potential here if only the flavour was more balanced and came with roti instead of naan (again, comparable to grocery store quality)
- TOFU AND VEGGIES: tofu and emoji mushrooms in a slurry of cornstarchy seaweed sauce. Again, had potential but too sweet.

The service aside from the really bizarre interaction with the manager post-taste was extremely diligent. We spotted a couple of kitschy dishes served at other tables, such as chicken served in a smoke dome and a teapot smoking with dry ice. Hard to say whether I'd give this place another shot...if anything, I'd only get another combo meal if I'm with a larger crowd yet don't have high hopes. Like a non-celebratory group meal."}
{"text":"they only take cash (not sure if debit, but definitely not credit). However the food was pretty good.

The lamb hot stone pot was great, and it's more of a Chinese style shaguo rather than a bibimbab (as it's listed on the menu).

The crispy chicken was reaaally really good,l. They serve it with a salt blend with msg (weijing). Some people are against it, and other people defend msg; I personally am indifferent. If you don't like msg don't dip the chicken in the salt blend.

The xo sauce is pretty good too, I forget what dish we got that had the sauce though, but it says on the menu."}
{"text":"My go to lunch place. It's great for groups and has a variety of different dishes for everyone. They serve traditional Canton style cuisine with a twist. Some may have a Western style twist but this is definitely not fusion. Although I found the lunch specials portions getting smaller the overall experience is great. Friendly service and great food I can't complain"}
{"text":"Came here twice for lunch and I'm really impressed by the pricing and portions of the food as well as the creativity of the menu! Between my two visits some unique (well at least unique to Toronto since I'm sure many items have already been done in TW or HK) were the condensed milk bread cubes, the baked pork chop in tomato sauce fried rice in toast box, and a baked pork riced with yin yang sauce (cream and tomato). All of these items are very affordably priced and come in MASSIVE portions. The pork rice w/ yin yang sauce for example was a lunch item for around $8 but was seriously enough to feed 2-3 ppl on its own. We also ordered fried capelins, which came in generous portions once again and it was particularly notable because the batter was well seasoned and the capelins were fried to a perfect crunch. We also got the steak cubes in mustard sauce. Surprisingly decent quality beef, and a mustard sauce that I personally enjoy but may be criticized by others for leaning towards the sweeter end. 

Drink wise I tried out the milk tea with red bean ice cubes, and quite frankly it really is just a novelty item. not worth the 3/4.99 that they're charging. Might try another one fo the novelty drinks though just out of curiousity. 

Service was also quick and efficient. Typical asian restaurant service.

Overall, I really enjoyed my visit here. Definitely visit if you're looking for something cheap, filling and unique within the GTA. However, I can only speak to the lunch experience so I'm not sure if they are just as good for dinner."}
{"text":"It was actually pretty difficult to figure out where the entrance of My Wonderful Kitchen was. You need to go towards the back edge where there is a door. After 10 minutes of figuring that out, my partner and I were seated in the restaurant. First of all, the decor is very nice. Not fancy, but clean and comfortable. Our servers also wore electric name tags - very neat. For a cafe, it provides a nice modern day feel to the environment. 

When I looked at the menu, I was quite overwhelmed with the selection - there's SO much. Eventually, I turned to yelp and checked photos for my selection. My partner and I ordered the Turnip Cake (curry flavored), Baked rice with pork and portugese sauce in toast and Spicy Beef (Innards) Noodle Soup. Let's start with the soup. The noodle soup was good - but insanely spicy. My tongue legit-ly numbed from the spiciness of the soup. I didn't finish it, but I did take it home and added more ingredients to buffer the spiciness out. Next is the turnip cake. I actually really liked the curry flavored turnip cake. It's not something I usually have but it's quite good. Now the last dish was the baked rice in toast with sauce. I honestly just came here for this dish because it was plastered all over my instagram wall by friends. The plate was easily the size of my head, and the presentation of the dish was very impressive. However, upon consumption, it felt as though I was eating oil. The dish is extremely greasy, so it was...very filling, very fast. I should also mention I felt insanely thirsty afterwards. 

In terms of service - surprisingly slow. It wasn't packed, nor were there little people. But it took us awhile to wave someone down. The servers were quick to help us after we were able to get someone though. Overall, I'd come back here again to try other foods, but I think it'll be awhile because of the greasiness."}
{"text":"Food: 7/10 -- Value: 7/10 -- Service: 7/10 -- Ambiance/Décor: 8/10

Wi-fi password is 9058891088.

For a Chinese diner-ish place, it's pretty nicely decorated. Staff have LED marquee name tags and it's comfortable inside. The red vertical lights on the outside have a pleasant strip club vibe. Counter-intuitively, you have to drive to the back of the restaurant to enter because you can't enter where all the lights and restaurant sign are. 

If you're sitting near the front of the restaurant in that awkward row of tables, it's going to be rough; you might never get service. The last time I went and sat further in though, they had buttons at our table, so maybe they have these at the front too, which would solve that problem. 

My favourite thing here is the box toast, fried rice, meat, and sauce dish. It's best with ketchup/tomato sauce; the white cream sauce is not flavourful enough and doesn't seem to go with everything else. The first time I had this dish, it was so good. The toast was so crispy and tasty.

Most recently, it was too oily and I felt like such a slob after eating maybe half of it. The meat also had a bit of an old taste to it. 

So maybe it's hit or miss. It's probably one of the more refined Chinese diners but the service and food can sometimes be spotty."}
{"text":"Great food and nice clean and modern place. I haven't tried that many dishes here, but my favourite is the claypot rice. Please note that this will take 25-30 mins, so order this first! This rice is authentic and comes out piping hot. Leave the rice in the pot for a bit and you would get the crispy rice along the outer side. The soya sauce was not too salty and really sweet, perfect complement to the rice. The sausage and spare ribs were okay.

I liked the barbecue pork and duck, although it was a bit salty and fatty. And I like the fried taiwanese vermicelli with dried scallop. I can't wait to try the baked rice in block toast and I can't believe they serve waffles here, the kids love it. Overall, the dishes were up to standards, the decor is okay. The service from the staff was meh. And they didn't accept credit cards for us."}
{"text":"Very interesting place! The chairs are huge so don't bother with your fisher price booster seat it won't fit!! Just ask them for a high chairs it's quite clean! This place  has been open for about five months. This place is huge and roomy with good air flow! It's cleaning and there are mini stations with touch screen stations for kids to entertain themselves with games and even movies. The food was above average and the price was not bad at all. 8 people , we spend 12.50 per person. It comes with free dessert mango sago we had it in big shot glasses. Parking is at the back, rarely with any empty spaces. You park at the front with quite a distance to wall, not ideal for colder weather and with a kid! Overall it was a good experience with friendly and prompt staff with a smile on their faces!"}
{"text":"This place has a bright fuchsia pink sign which is nice because it's different from all the other Chinese restaurants out there.  But it's weird because the entrance of the restaurant is at the back.  I walked into the restaurant and it was packed!  It was decorated very modern and sophisticated.  It was also very clean, being a Chinese restaurant and I noticed all the waitresses wear flashing name tags.. pretty cool.  We were seated at the very back of the restaurant and we decided to order a Baked E-Fu Noodle that was a creamy cheese based sauce with shrimp.  The dish was a pretty big portion of noodles but the overall taste was a bit bland and there was a lot more noodles than shrimp.  We also ordered a Seafood Fried Noodle that had broccoli, scallops, squid, and shrimp on crispy egg noodles.  That was pretty good, but it was like your typical fried noodles, nothing special.  We also ordered a Spicy Salt Mushroom dish that was interesting, it was battered mushrooms with a little kick of spice to it.  That was a good side dish that was delicious, but a little salty on its own.  We also ordered their famous Baked Rice with Pork Chop Served in Bread Loaf with Curry Sauce.  You get to have a choice of chicken or pork chop with a curry or tomato sauce.  It was pretty interesting because the curry is covered with bread on the outside, but once you cut into the cube of bread, it's filled with rice on the inside.  I thought it tasted pretty good, except again, there was more bread and rice than meat. Most of the food is not traditional Chinese food, rather more Chinese fusion or cafe style.  Overall the presentation of all the food was very appealing and appetizing. Once we got the bill, they gave us complimentary desserts which was Mango Sago!  Exciting for me, as traditional Chinese restaurants always give Red Bean as their dessert.  Yuck!  As I was walking out of the restaurant to leave, I noticed they had iPads on the walls that allow people to use them while they were waiting to be seated!  I've never seen that before so one added star for that.  Other than that, it's not as wonderful of a kitchen as it makes out to be."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go for dim sum. Food was really good and the service is above-average. Really impressed when asked for cold water they provided us with cold bottled water! Something did not expect at all. Been there for dinner. Portions could be a little bit more but overall food is very good.


I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a dim sum to go there!"}
{"text":"*Insert unoriginal get back to the kitchen joke*

Great place for groups. Wonderful decor. I ordered the Crispy chicken (picture below) Not what I expected. I thought it's breaded, fried boneless chicken. It was pretty tasty so I'm not complaining. My friend ordered spicy beef and said that he loved it.

They had a huge bowl of pork bone soup for $3.99. Sounds like a sweet deal but trust me its not worth it as it tastes like meh. Order a decent soup from their soup menu or don't order soup at all"}
{"text":"This restaurant has changed their Chinese name at least twice but the English name remains the same. Each time when they changed the name, the menu was also changed. The first one was msg heavy. The second one was good but they didn't serve dim sum. The dim sum in the latest one is decent. I went there when the latest one was opened for just a few weeks. All dim sum items were good except the steamed rice roll. It was way too thick. Went again recently and notice their steamed rice roll is improved! Overall the dim sums here are less oily than other places and are flavorful. The kids all were very excited to see the mango mochi being served.

Dinner is on the expensive side but their ingredients are good. Tried the lamb in a hot pot recently. The quality of the lamb was good and it was noticeably fresher and more tasty than some other restaurants. But you pay for what you get: $45 here vs $27 from other places.

The service was good and the restaurant looks clean."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time was okay, I was a little dissapointed by the lack of lunch options they had. To my surprise the menu wasn't even afternoon tea set so I had to force myself to pick something off the lunch menu without spending 20 dollars on one dish from the regular menu. I had the fried sauce noodles with soup base on the side (direct translation) and it was taste for the most part but really heavy and a little too sweet for my liking. 

So I had breakfast this morning here, and I was just blown away by how many mistakes the waitresses made. Breakfast menu was still limited but had a good enough variety. I ordered something very simple, luncheon meat, egg and ramen noodles with milk tea. Not only did my milk tea come luke warm which cooled a little too quickly (by the time I was done putting one pack of sugar the tea was slightly warmer than room temperature) but they also put a plate of toast, egg and luncheon meat with no noodles. When I sent my order back, they came back with the same thing but with vermicelli. After the second time I said I want luncheon meat with RAMEN! I gave in, I was in a rush and didn't want to be too much trouble so didnt send my noodles back. I noticed the same waitress made several other mistakes by mixing up orders with the tables next to us. She must be half awake or something. .... even though I'm eating at 10:30am... 

I also ordered a French toast, and I will admit this was my mistake. I was looking forward to eating hk style french toast with peanut butter in it. It didn't say in the menu whether or not it had peanut butter so maybe next time I need to ask and request it if they can accommodate that. 

Other than my waitress still being in lala land... service was quick and the staff were pretty polite. the food itself is passable. Prices are reasonable and the dining room /bathrooms are clean. It's a big location so I like how we've never had to wait for a table. The dining room is also very spacious, spacious and clean so that was a plus. I probs won't come back unless I def have to."}
{"text":"Came in at 10:15pm, asked if it was too late to grab dessert. They said it was fine.
The ice cream tower is just cheap no name neapolitan ice cream from a big tub and it was also freezer burnt. The wafer crisps in between were very stale and cheap tasting. Around 10:30, two servers were standing around our table after the last table just left and were wearing their WINTER JACKETS just waiting for us to leave. 
I know the service is rough in establishments such as this, but come on, don't tell me it's fine to come in and rush me out 15min after."}
{"text":"Peking duck was delicious , thinly sliced, crispy and not too fatty. The grouper fish we ordered was fresh. The steamed lobster was a bit undercooked at first, they re-steamed for a bit longer which is totally fine. 
Almond paste dessert was yummy. Not sure if they made it in house. My 2nd time here and I am still impressed.
It's on a pricey side but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. Suddenly I'm very disappointed that this restaurant DO NOT accept credit card!!!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service! Long story short, the server got our order mixed up and the manager refused to change the bill.  the difference was only $4 but the manager made it sounded like we are scaming them. Will never go back again!"}
{"text":"A:  Let's go to My Wonderful Kitchen.
B:  But you don't have any food in your fridge.
A:  Exactly!  Let's go.

Vibrant playful décor, half full dining room, 1 to 4 staff-tables ratio.
No CP24, no Fairchild, no TVpad, not my style of HK café/kitchen.
Not much that'll give me the go-ahead to map the place for you.

On my return, I shall choose the following:

N01. Baked Rice with Pork Chop served in Bread Loaf(Tomato Sauce)

- Meaty, carby, saucy, greasy, umami, filling, wonderful.
- Perfect for a growing boy(singular, max 2 ppl not really).
- Makes you wonder why others only fill soup in bread bowls.

Complimentary dessert

- It's free
- It's tiny
- But free"}
{"text":"My 2nd visit to the newly re-opened My Wonderful Kitchen. This time, we opted to pre-book and order from the special price fix menu. We only had 9 guests so we got 8 dishes (plus soup and dessert) for $40 per person (apparently Mon to Thurs is cheaper at $35/pp, and over 10 people get an extra dish). Most of these dishes can't be ordered from the regular menu, so only available through the special pre-book menu. Some dishes like the s&s pork is on the main menu, but was told by the manager that our dish uses better quality pork that is leaner than the regular order (can't confirm without trying the dish from the regular menu to compare, but our pork was definitely very lean and not fatty like the cubes of lard they serve at Richlane court). 

I would rate the quality and taste of the food as very good. Maybe not quite as good as Dragonboat or Ming's Cuisine, but pretty close. The presentation of the food is even better and is really a work of art. The portion of the food is also excellent and between the 9 of us, we were stuffed. 

The service was excellent, especially the manager that helped choose the menu items for us. He came over often to make sure everything was good and even helped serve some of the dishes to everyone. 

The atmosphere is quite nice. It's not a sardine can like at Ming's and the tables are spaced far enough apart that you can have a conversation without yelling. 

The only thing that I didn't like was that they brought out only one dish at a time. I guess they do this on purpose so that we can enjoy each dish while it's hot and fresh. But personally, I like to eat my meat with my veggies, and don't like eating noodles by itself. Also, it's easier to end up over-eating because it's hard to judge how much food is still coming, especially since not all dishes are the same size. Just personal preference, and I suppose next time we can ask for all dishes to be sent out together. 

Overall, had a great dinner. Will definitely come back to try out some new items."}
{"text":"This place has the worst service. I came here for lunch and when we walked in and the manager pointed us to walk inside so u assumed that someone was showing us a table but no one showed us. I was confused so I walked around to see if there was a free table. NOTHING. so I go back to the front asking \"is there someone supposed to show us our table?!\" and the server was oh here's a number wait. So waited a few mins. She calls us to walk over to a table! Again no one is showing us where the table is and we don't get directed to any table and had to walk around the whole resturant confused. This time I just sat down on an empty table. Fed up with this lack of service. 

There is a lot of food selection, rice pots take 30 mins. I also ordered lemon tea less sugar and of course when it came it was not less sugar and when I asked the waiter she totally ignored and walked away. 

I would def not come back base on the service even if the food was amazing but the food was just mediocre."}
{"text":"* The Place: getting to the main door was weird, some how we got in through the washroom entrance :/.. It's nice decorated, at first glance you might thing it's a bit expensive place.

* Staff: nice ppl, trained and fast

* FOOD: very good and tasty. Ordered the steak with mustard sauce, is excellent and I'll recommend it. The other signature dish was their fried rice in a baked loaf of bread and we ordered it with tomato sauce and pork. So, the dish is good, but not amazing, i guess i was expecting too much from the picture and reading the content. All because the dish is not new at all, is fried rice with tomato sauce (the Chinese style pork-fried-rice you would fine anywhere else), the bread looks mainly like a decoration. But don't get me wrong, the dish is good looking... That's it lol. If you are Chinese it won't surprise you.

Definitely going back to try other chef recommendation."}
{"text":"First off, the entrance is quite hidden, around the corner and through a backdoor. I was also seated in a semi-circle lounge type seat so it was kinda odd because it was right in the main hallway where everyone walks by and looks at you and what you're eating. 

They have quite an extensive menu but the food was so so, I'll probably only be back if a group of friends want a variety of different things."}
{"text":"Went for pm tea deal for the first time.  Compared to other hk diners, very spacious and bright.

Beef innard soup noodle with tea for $5 great value.  Noodle came piping hot, large portion and tasty.  Both our noodles tasted above average.  Fried chicken wings took longer but nicely done.

Lunch menu looks tempting.  Prices slightly higher than other hk diners in the area but stirfried nnodles on other tables looked pretty good size as we?l.  Will definitely come back.  Prefer to pay a little more for comfort and free wifi.

Dinner menu has most dishes around $12 range.  Good service and gòod food.  Nice dishware.  No free mini dessert for pm tea."}
{"text":"I'm very unimpressed with this place. First of all, when parked, the door and signs facing highway 7.. THIS IS THE BACK.... WTF? The door only said \"please use other entrance\" without any signs that tell you where to go. My lost ass wandered around until I peeked in like a creeper and saw that people were exiting in the back. Ugh.

When walking in, there's a man just sitting at a desk but he's not a host.. he's literally just there. He looked up at us and had a look like \"why are you just standing here..\" until he eventually pointed us in through this long and dreary hallway, where we were surprised to see tables situated along the side of.. how completely AWKWARD would it be sitting there. Definitely would NOT like to see any random faces staring me down as they pass by while I'm enjoying a meal. Lucky for me, it doesn't look like I'll be enjoying anything here anytime soon.

Upon sitting down (8pm), we were informed that we can't get the thing we came for (those heavenly pics of the baked spaghetti, carbonara.. in the brick toast). Apparently anything 'western' style was off limits because that chef had closed kitchen. Ummmm... but your restaurant closes at 11pm.. There's a first for everything and that was a first I've heard of a kitchen closing 3hrs early. She told me that chef finishes work at 7pm while the other one who can do all the other dishes is still working.. HUH??? The dishes are not in any means 'difficult' to make, so would it be that difficult hiring somebody who can do both? Or training both chefs to make all dishes on the menu? So inconvenient. 

We ended up ordering pineapple and soft-shelled crab fried rice and this chicken/corn soup. I also had this ice cream coffee thing because I was craving naughty foods. They were both meh and definitely something we could've gotten a bigger portion of for a cheaper price at congee queen. The soft-shell crab was saltier than the ocean it came from. We didn't 100% finish any of the dishes before leaving because our appetites were just not having it. 

+1 for service because honestly they were very nice and smiley, something you don't witness a lot in chinese restaurants. They smiled through the pain of a screaming child (who I almost cussed out) so props to them."}
{"text":"Pros:

- Nicely decorated.
- Lots of variety.
- Decently priced.
- 10% discount if you pay by cash.
- Fast service.

Cons:
- It took an hour for us to get seated. They should really work on accommodations...
- The layout of the restaurant was a bit odd. There were booths along the hallway towards the actual restaurant. 
- We were (unfortunately) seated in one of those booths. Since it was so cold when we came in, our food didn't stay hot for long and we were constantly cold. 
- The food itself was just average. Not amazing, not terrible either. Just unremarkable."}
{"text":"This place used to be a hong kong style type restuarant with stir fry dishes and baked rice. They did a complete renovation so it serves dim sum now. The place is beautifully renovated with modern lighting. They have morning special with small, medium, large dim sum costing only $2.99 before 11 am. This appplies monday to friday excluding holidays. The tea pricr is $1.50/person. This place opens at 8:30 am, and I walked in at 8:40. There were only a few occupied tables. All the staff were really polite and considerate. 

However, maybe I was just super unlucky because my dishes were so dirty with very noticable yellow stains, despite asking them to change it for me twice. But other people at my table had clean dishes, so I was just unlucky. I got bbq roasted pork cheung fun (rice noodle) and I didnt like it because there was too much fat on the meat. The shrimp dumpling had a really thick skin but the shrimp was fresh. The steamed chicken and steamed salmon was ok. The matcha glutinous crepe with sweet nuts was good."}
{"text":"It's the same name but the owners have changed and so has the Chinese Name.

1st) When you drive by it at night only the Chinese name is lit up.  So anyone who doesn't read Chinese might not know what or where this place is.

2nd) THE ENTRANCE IS IN THE BACK, facing the underground parking.

Food
=============
I went back to this place yesterday and ordered take-out. We ordered the Peking duck, fried chicken and stir-fry beans (Si Ji Dou).  I ordered take-out this time as it was movie night at the home!

Peking duck was still just as good.

Fried chicken--dry.  It feels like the kind of dry chicken you get when it has been sitting under a heat lamp too long :(.

Beans were okay, but the seasoning was a bit light and just a tad too oily for my tastes.

Service
=============
The service was good for take out too.  Very friendly staff!  We thought they did a price calculation error and we called them back when we were home.

The staff that answered the phone kindly explained how the price was calculated.  


Overall
=============
Coming back a second time I was a little disappointed that the chicken was dry.  The other dishes were still good and the staff was friendly courteous.

Just saw they had a pretty decent lunch menu too, will update the review if I go there for lunch!"}
{"text":"Good cheap food family dinner hangout spot. I think compared to congee queen this place is slightly healthier and not as loud. I went to this restaurant on 2 Fridays in a row and seats were comfortable, food was quick.  We ordered steamed bass with green onions and soy sauce, tofu veggie stone pot, steamed chicken. We wanted to order simple steamed less greasy dishes and the chefs did not disappoint us.  The entrance is hidden in a corner and many customers cannot figure where this place is but overall I think this place is a good choice if you're looking for comfy environment."}
{"text":"Been here once before.  Tonight was our second time here.  Nice decor inside.  Service ain't half bad.  The food ain't half bad either.  Typical Chinese cuisine options from congee to noodles to rice.  All kinds of assortments.  Recommendation for dining here during a Friday evening or any evening during the weekend...Go earlier than 6 PM, otherwise good luck finding parking for your vehicle 'cuz this restaurant is situated on Highway 7 and people who know the area know Highway 7."}
{"text":"loooovvvee coming here... someone introduced me to this place recently and I can't stop raving about it. Their items and dishes are very similar to Hong Kong style food.

This is not your typical Cha Chang Tang as the restaurant offers a lot of dishes suitable for dinners. 

Their menu items are reasonable priced.. nothing is too expensive.. I don't think I have tried anything that I didn't enjoy at all from their extensive menu.
Also, their afternoon tea special is such a bargain.. you will be so filled up..   

The wait time for a table is not long too.. I usually waited max 10 minutes.  

Customer service: always prompt and no forgotten orders at all.   
Bonus at the end: you get a free mango tapioca dessert at the end :D  

Love their hot pot rice. (well worth the wait), their red bean drink, the mustard steak cubes etc.


The negative: 
 
no medium round tables for groups of 5 to 7..  so need to sit at a long tables.. which makes it hard to share food, especially when all the limited booths are taken 

so few big round tables

the entrance can be confusing as a lot of people think the entrance is the one facing on hwy 7 when you see the sign as you drive back but the entrance is tucked inside Chalmers.

closes way too early!! Need to stay open later ahh~~~!!

The tables at the entrance not very desirable since you are facing everyone while people walk by and  look at u eating.. 

no more BBQ roasted pork  :("}
{"text":"A first time visit to this Chinese restaurant and went with my friends for dim sum. 

This is an upscale Chinese dim sum place and the food did not let me down. The steamed Chiu Chow style dumpling was awesome. The dumpling skin was much thinner tham most restaurants and the filling was fresh. This is a simple dumpling but most restaurants had the skin a bit too thick and filling was coarse, but here, it is comparable to the ones in Hong Kong. 

The other dimsum that was nicely done was the shrimp steamed rice noodle. The rice noodle was so smooth and it was very thin, just finely wrapping the steamed shrimp and veggies.  The soy sauce that came with the dish was warm and unlike other restaurants. 

We ordered the fried glutinous rice, though it was a tadbit greasy, the texture of rice was just right, not too soft. Unlike other restaurants where the rice would stick together like balls of rice, MWK was able to deliver a dish where the rice was presented like individual pearls. The texture was rich! 

I was too full but next time i will definitely try their desserts !"}
{"text":"worst restaurant that I've ever had in GTA! 

We order the seafood combo for 4 person including tax end up almost $93, before we came in manager said Lobster around one and a half pounds , for North America we all use personal honest system ,right ? of course we trust restaurateur , didn't measure the actual weight and look up, when the food came,OMG..the Lobster meat & one and half claws were missing, hey... we pay we expect Lobster is having full meat & Claws , Can't believe any reason; any excuses or they may took away part of our Lobster.

Also the deep fried half chicken, they gave us all the white meat part , they seem keep all dark meat on behind .

the unmissing dish of the night was the steamed fish, cuz they can't steal any part of fish lol hahaha, only fish is exactly whole steamed fish 

soup & vegetables were mediocre.

*definitely not go back !! i don't satisfied short food and bad services.

However not suggest people to try out , if try ..be more careful w the food they prep on the future *"}
{"text":"Came for dinner last night (Tuesday night). It was hard to find the entrance for this restaurant! Anyway, I was a little skeptical about this place after reading all the negative reviews on Yelp. However, perhaps because we went on a weekday and they were less busy, service was quick and they were all very nice. They also have free wifi. We ordered the baked tomato sauce spaghetti with fried chicken stuffed in bread loaf and eel fried rice. While the spaghetti was a bit on the sweet side, we enjoyed both our dishes very much! The bread loaf was not as oily as I thought it would be. It was crunchy and quite tasty to eat with the sauce! Their dishes are priced a bit higher than regular chinese diners, but their presentations are much better too.. They also gave us free dessert after our meal (chilled mango sago). Overall this was a great experience. I recommend you all to go, and I will be back too!"}
{"text":"Nothing to write home about. One of the true test of going to this type of restaurants is to have the baked pork chop rice/spaghetti. Came here for afternoon tea and ordered exactly that and was disappointed that it was just like any other. First of all, it was not even baked. Not even for one minute to crisp the top of the sauce. The pork was alright, but no taste if it wasn't for the sauce. Spaghetti was alright, but made the dish watery as previously stated in other reviews. The cup of milk tea tasted well enough, but was small compared to other restaurants like this. I would not come here unless I was already in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Cool typically Chinese restaurant with a Italian looking decor. Cutting boards and wine all over the walls brings me to drunken charcuterie days!

Came with 9 others, my boyfriend and his family celebrating his pop's birthday . 

Food: 9 course (I think) meal! At first things were popping out fast - the soup (delish), abalone and greens (drool), and the humongous lobster platter! The platter came with dry ice; it looked awesome although not sure of the significance of this dry ice thing. Regardless, you will find it insta/snap worthy, or at least I did. 

That's where the service tanked. Apparently we had about 6 more courses to go but it was roughly an hour until the next dish came out. This was very disappointing as the food was well prepared. 

Food: 4/5 for Chinese food. The go above for presentation and even more for taste. The food did leave me with the oily feeling you still get form the food, but really above par! 

Service: This one weighs more for me. 10 of us had yo wait around an hour for our other courses to come out, which dulled the whole experience. The servers were not as responsive as we were hoping when we asked, so quite disappointed. 

Clean washrooms (for a Chinese restaurant I know), so really not a bad place. 

With the variety of restaurants to choose from uptown, I would consider going else where though."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall for this restaurant, including a half star to the restaurant owner who does look for improvement.  

I came here for dinner with my family the first time.  We ordered Thai red curry chicken served with bread.  The idea and presentation was creative but the curry was way too sweet.

Fried beef spaghetti tasted ok but the spaghetti is a wee bit too soft.  The water still stayed from the cooked spaghetti in the boiling water.   Was it not fried thoroughly? 

Fried garlic and beef rice tasted good but I prefer my fried rice is fried a bit dry.  The portion of beef could be a bit more for $9 something?  

The black pepper pork stomach soup was just so-so.

We were served with a complimentary mini dessert, mango sago (??????) at the end.  It was surprisingly good. 

The service was very friendly.  The restaurant asked for customers' comments.  I hope they can do better than so-so soon.  

I might not come back for dinner again yet.  However, I will still be interested to go try their red bean ice tea with red bean ice cube for the hopefully hot summer:)"}
{"text":"Have been here several times now, mostly over lunch hours, and have never been disappointed. The lunch combos are a good deal and good portioned. I have noticed their lunch combos menu changes periodically. They usually have at least one baked pasta/rice dish and it's a huge portion for $8.99! The milk tea is also pretty decent, maybe a bit on smaller side."}
{"text":"I saw a lot of pictures of the baked rice inside a toasted brick and I decided to order it ($8.95). You get to choose what type of meat and sauce you want on top. It looked really good but truth be told, it was very heavy and oily. I couldn't even finish a quarter of it so I took it home and ate it later (minus the toast). The baked rice itself was tasty and so was the pork chop that came with it. The toast was only crispy on the outsides since it was soaked in oil on the inside... They have a special for every table where you can order a hot pot of pork bone and mustard green soup for $3.99 which was really good. There's also a lot of add-ons you can have for a cheaper price. The fries were really good. Their menu has a variety of items and I would go back to try more things."}
{"text":"This restaurant was highly recommended by a friend so we decided to give it a try.  We were there for afternoon tea and was quite pleased with everything they had to offer.  We were there on a weekday so it wasn't overly packed so the service was great.  

We ordered the BBQ pork with rice after seeing that they had BBQ items were made on-site.  The pork was tender and juicy since there's a bit of fat in it which makes it so tasty.  We also ordered chicken pad thai - the portion was generous however I had to deduct a mark here because it was a bit on the tart side.  Don't get me wrong, it still tastes good, but I prefer if it was less tart. 

Drink and dessert was included in the afternoon tea.  I love how you didn't have to pay extra for cold drinks and dessert was a bonus!  I didn't expect that but it's always great to finish a meal with dessert :)

There are many items I would love to try, so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The hallway where the entrance was, had some seating on the sides. The decor was quite nice. As we walked inside to find more seating, we realize it was quite large. Even though the front was grand, the inside had a mixture of decor with wodden cutting boards and salt & pepper shakers. 

We didn't order the unique dishes that I saw on other yelpers' photos. I did order Shrimp Cheese Sauce with E-fu Noodles, a combo of both Western & Asian Style. I had mix reviews from my friends, but I didn't mind it. Shrimps were quite big in size, so that's a bonus. 

Other dishes we ordered was:

Beef & Egg Rice~ This was ok but presentation
was lacking. The white rice was a pile on one side & the Beef & Egg on the other. Looks like something you just dump on a plate at home.

Seafood Congee~ Congee was silky and tasty and came in a nice black ceramic pot.

Two Type Bbq Meat Dish: Roasted Duck & Honey Roasted Pork ~ Duck was ok, Honey Roasted Pork was good but a bit fatty.

Chicken & Veggie Stir-fry~ Chicken was nice and smooth and tasty.

Deep fried Radish Cubes ~ This is a snack dish. The presentation was nicely plated and the cubes were yummy.

Overall, the food was pretty good. I would definitely go back to try other unique dishes I didn't try the first time."}
{"text":"We ordered the baked rice toast box with chicken & black pepper sauce and a sliced fish & preserved egg congee.

Congee was pretty standard as expected but this place seems to be known for its savoury toast boxes so I had high expectations going in. In the end, I wasn't disappointed but wasn't overly impressed either. The rice and sauce were good and consistent with what you would find at any HK cafe. I liked the contrast of flavours between the savouriness of the sauce and the sweetness of the toast. However, my boyfriend didn't like that the sauce made the toast soggy and said that the chicken was quite dry.

In the end, not a bad meal. This place goes pretty heavy on the oil and salt though so you might want to order lighter side dishes!"}
{"text":"Not a big fan of this place at all.. The place is nice and the seating area is cool and fun to be at. But the food is not my type I had a plate of sweet chicken and they were not impressive the thing that I really did not like is the soup. They had special soup for 3 99 which I assumed is a good deal as all the other soups are like 10 buck. Anyways the soup I ordered was pork soup which was horrible they guy brought a whole station to keep the soup warm and stuff but the soup itself was bad. And I mean bad it is water with bones and the water did not taste good at all. My refunded toon when u come to this place is not to order the soup."}
{"text":"2.5 stars. Congee is OK but the tomato sauce baked pork chop rice isn't. 

Fish filet & beef Congee 
- fresh fish but dry
- beef is fine 

Baked pork chop rice, tomato sauce 
- dislike the texture and flavor of the sauce. Different from hk style,  it is sour,sticky rue, not really a sauce 
- pork is hard, dry, tough

Egg and beef fried rice noodle 
- beef and egg sauce served separate from the noodles 
- beef is fine , noodles a bit oily 

Overall just came here cause I was in the area.  Stick with Congee and maybe noodles."}
{"text":"Ok, so we didn't end up having a meal here because the menu changed. We specifically went for the brick toast bowl of food which they no longer do (see Yelp pictures for reference). However the decor and the wait staff were amazingly polite and nice. 
This is the type of restaurant you'd go with a family of 8 and order a bunch of dishes to share communal style. They also have that format in preset course dinners (Chinese banquet style). I guess I'll be returning with my family to check this one out but A++ for the service of the wait staff."}
{"text":"Lunch was a good deal, very good food quality, quiet environment, and good service. I would come back for lunch. 

I peeked at the dinner menu and it looked overpriced to me."}
{"text":"Extremely bad services. Waited 35 min for a my order and the servicer was extremely rude when we ask him to check our order for us. Food was average but bad value consider the price are not cheap. I have a 10% discount card from them and when I paid the bill it shows a two dollars discount while the amount of my bill is over hundred. When I asked the waiter he was not able to explain it and just keeping saying most of the dishes are excluded from the 10% loyalty card. But he failed to explain what is the criteria and it is not stated on the card. Don't mind paying a little more but a dishonest business? Not again !"}
{"text":"I stopped by for some Chinese food in the afternoon. I arrived there and it was conveniently happy hour there. During happy hour (3:00pm to 5:30pm) they offered afternoon specials that ranged from $5-$10 which included a drink the meal itself and a small dessert. 

I had the Singapore noodles with shrimp and shredded pork (Sing Jau Chow Mai). It's a curry flavoured noodle dish. I originally expected a small dish, but surprisingly it was a very decent portion along with the other items on the afternoon specials menu (friends' orders). I intend on visiting this place again and will recommend others to come for a good price for good quality and good portions."}
{"text":"Nope. Not going back.  Not sure why the food costed average $57/person.  Yes, it was a seafood meal, but we had indigestion problems afterwards for several days.  This was the price for food that looked nice, but did not taste any better than the usual $30 meals. Also, we were told that we had no choice but to take a lobster that was over the original weight as outlined in the meal, resulting in an unnecessary increase for the price of our meal.  The lobster was way overcooked, by the way.  Their specialty dessert? Mango sago in shot glasses (ayce style, except we were paying at least double the price) and peach buns that took way too long to steam."}
{"text":"Very unorganized restaurant!

We had come here for Chinese new year dinner and booked a table with a set meal ahead of time - with the reservation you get $30 off. Upon our arrival they seated us and we thought they they had acknowledged our reservation. We waited for our meal for 20 minutes. They then came to tell us that their smallest lobster was 6lbs so we would have to pay extra for the one lb which was $20 extra...we were ok with this, but not happy we were not given the option of getting the appropriate sized lobster on the set meal. 10 minutes later they came back saying we didn't reserve the meal ahead of time and that they didn't have the Peking duck available with the set meal. As well we wouldn't get the $30 discount either since they didn't have us on the reservation list. We decided to leave as they had the power to honour the $30 reservation discount and wouldn't. While we were leaving there were several other tables who had the same issue."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last month for dim sum and was impressed.  So I decided to try its dinner last night with family to celebrate a special event, even though GTA was hit with ice storm.  I wasn't disappointed, the food was good, service was good, washroom was clean.  Only downside is portion is small, therefore I take away one star.  Hint, the entrance is actually located at the back of the building, even though the address is on Hwy 7 East. But you can take a short cut by walking through the building lobby, if your park your car at the front of the Restaurant."}
{"text":"Disappointed with the lemon chicken with rice in hot pot.  A few slices of lemon were put on top of the chicken as garnish, but couldn't taste any lemon.  There were just a few chunks of chicken, and they tasted bland : ("}
{"text":"Overall, 3.5 stars.

Decor: Very pretty and contemporary.  I really like the decorative lamps and the cutting boards wall.  MWK is family friendly, too, as there are a few tablets in the waiting area to keep the children occupied.  The washrooms are located near the front door.

Food: 
The 2 Choice of BBQ Meat ($9.50) was well portioned, but the taste was no better than Chinese grocery stores quality.   Depending on your need/preference, you may or may not want to order this entree.  

Beef Slices with Garlic Shoots  ($9) was tasty.  The beef was tender and well marinated.  The sauce tasted a mix of salt and sugar. It was well portioned for the price.  It was the best dish of the evening.

Fukien Fried Rice ($10) presented uniquely.  The sauce and the rice was plated separately.  The sauce portion, which had seafood, tasted like it was close to going bad but just not yet.  I poured white pepper in it.  

Services: Food came out very fast.  The waitresses did not smile much.  The manager was full of smiles, though."}
{"text":"This is now one my favourite places for dimsum. Good price, food is consistently delicious, and service is okay. If you can go before 11am, they offer early bird special."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant that opened about 2 weeks ago. Their English name remains the same, but Chinese name is different from before.
Whatever reviews that you read about this restaurant before mid-March 2017 do  not apply. 

Three of us went for Monday early bird Dim Sum. $2.99 flat rate for S,M,L Dim Sum. We were greeted by smiling managers at door. Our waitress greet us with big smile.

Quality of Dim Sum is much better than other restaurant near by. Love their Har Gow. Best part is their service, they have the best service for Chinese restaurant in my memory.

I suggest you go as early as possible, when I left around 10:15AM on Monday, there was a line up at door."}
{"text":"Great dim sum! The variety and quality of dim sum here is probably some of the best around. They do it right with the standard items plus they have some unique items such as their fluffy bbq pork bun. This isn't just your standard bbq pork bun. It comes in one that has a very soft and light bun and filled with a large amount of pork. It is probably twice the size of your normal bbq pork bun. 

They egg custard bun is also amazing. Runny sweet egg yolk filling. 

Service is good and the atmosphere is nicer than most. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"A very nifty looking place. Video games at the entrance to keep kids busy if there are line ups. The place was very modern looking and a lot cleaner than most other HK style cafes. Came here on Friday to get their evening special which starts at 3:00pm.
Got some deep fried cubed toast with condensed milk $3.99 - It was a nice snack but I thought it was a bit plain even when drenched in condensed milk. I like the cubed toast at Kiko Cafe better. To keep with the deep fried theme we also got some spicy deep fried chicken wings. Very crispy on the skin and juicy on the inside. Done very well.

Also got some fried instant noodles with beef and a fried rice with beef. Both were good and similar to Congee Queen.

At the end of the meal you get a free dessert, either a tapioca pudding or a quarter of a waffle with a scoop of neapolitan ice cream. Went with the waffle and it was really good. Waffle was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. + 0.5 for free waffles.

Overall a very good HK style cafe with very good service.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Awesome dim sum!

Their weekday morning dimsum special is so worth it! That explains why they tend to get really busy the later you arrive so get here early!

Some notable items we ordered
- Steamed layered custard cake: SO GOOD. It's a classically-made must try. Steamed cake interspersed with custard and salty egg yolk filling - perfect balance of sweet and slightly salty.
- Bean curd roll: Delicious! Especially when you dip it in hot sauce!
- Rice rolls: A dimsum classic and very well made! Served with soy sauce on the side so you can add as much or as little as you like.
- Steamed Seafood Dumpling in soup: One of the better ones I've had! Unlike other places, it's filled with better quality ingredients! Also served with red vinegar on the side, definitely add this to the soup for added flavour! 
- Curry squid: YUMMY. Def order this too. The curry flavour is deep and a bit spicy!

Apparently, they are also known for their Baked BBQ Pork Bun... IMO it's a little bit too oily so opt for the steamed bun if you like things a bit lighter!

Service here is always amazing! Friendly, attentive, and extremely polite."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch on a weekday and ordered: chicken congee ($5.99) and clam fried noodles ($8.99). These were lunch combos so each came with a drink (typical choice of milk tea, lemon water/tea). The price at this place is very wallet friendly and has comfortable seating!

However, I gave this place a two star due to the long wait for the food and the taste/quality. The clam fried noodles had absolutely no taste, and the clams were slightly undercooked with a strong saltwater taste. The congee was extremely thick (almost gloopy). The chicken was cut into large pieces with their bones - this might be a personal preference since I don't like finding small bone pieces in my congee. 

All in all, would I come back? Probably not..."}
{"text":"This was a new place that recently open....decor was nice and simply altho I think the BBQ area didnt really match the flow of the decor 

A lot of variety in ur typical HK cafe with fried rice, noodles and stuff....they have a lunch menu with limited selection ranging from $7-$10 which all come with a drink

We orders the spicy pork lo mein which was pretty good, sweet and spicy, got the deep fried turnip which wasn't too good compared to the other place I've been too...the other dish we ordered was the baked chicken filet in bread loft with Portuguese sauce, presentation looked pretty neat, it's a huge bread loft loaded with rice inside but quality of the food was terrible....sauce was bland, chicken was fatty and too fried and the bread was just overly filling, we didn't even eat the bread at all after tasting it

For the price you pay for I rather goto oceans seafood across the street

This place is all about presentation but the quality of food is not good"}
{"text":"Had a combo with lobster and Peking duck.  Duck was meat,  but there were not enough shells to eat with.  Lobster was fried with Maggi sauce,  a tad on the dry side,  not enough Maggi taste, but presentation was great. Steamed talapia was just right. Sweet and  sour pork was  great,  nice sauce,  not too dry nor too fat.   Not your average red-cough-syrup sweetnsour sauce.  Service was great. Place was spacious and  not  noisy or echoey. No liquor license. The crowd here was considerate too.  I have a pet peeve about  live seafood tanks.  I would rather not have them unless they are clean. Too many  places are hideous looking tanks.  This one was OK. The decor is finished with fixtures with fine lines ever  I usually worry and dust collection or spider habitation.  Haven't seen any so far.  Overall very  clean and pleasant and homey. Not  a place for banquets but good for family dinners and  small group occasions."}
{"text":"It's authentic Hong Kong style food, yet what makes this place unique is its atmosphere.  It's clean and modern looking.  Even though my friend was not up for Hong Kong style food, he was impressed nonetheless.  

The service was good and the dishes served had instant appeal in the way it was presented.  I had the brick toast with chicken and cream sauce, which was recommended to me by a friend who had tried My Wonderful Kitchen.  I highly recommend this Hong Kong dish!  It's a square piece of toast with the middle dug out and filled with fried rice, chicken and topped with your choice of sauce and melted cheese."}
{"text":"We always drive by this place when we're around Highway 7.  Finally decided to give it a try.  Think Congee Wong, not as good food but better atmosphere and appearance.

Pros:
Restaurant has great decor and atmosphere, very professional looking
Portions on their rice and noodle dishes are huge

Cons:
Prices are a little higher
Food is average at best

When you drive in, you notice that the side facing the street is not the entrance.  You need to drive all the way round back to find the main entrance.  As soon as you get in though, you notice this place is huge.  There are plenty of seats.  The decor is very nice as well.  This place's main selling point in my opinion is how it looks and feels.  It's very modern looking like a expensive restaurant should be.  The seat s are some of the more comfortable seats I've sat in recent memory.  Everything about this place tries to shout fine dining.

As soon as I sit down I l glance over at the table next to us.  I see they've ordered a fired noodle.  What I notice more is the plate it's on.  It's huge and they filled it all the way.  I have never seen an order of noodles that big.  We order a noodle ourselves, a plate of veggies, clams (on recommendation by the server) and a soup.  My Wonderful Kitchen offers a soup for $3.99 that's served in a clay pot over a burner.  Most places might offer soup for free, but the soup here and how it's done is worth the 4 dollars.    

The food altogether was a little underwhelming.  It's OK, but it doesn't match the atmosphere level of this place.  I found a lot of the dishes to be over salted.  The clams that were recommended were nothing special at all.  It was my least favourite actually.  Don't get me wrong, none of them were particularly bad, but nothing I would recommend myself.  The soup was my fav, it was a little weird paying for soup, but well worth it.  

My Wonderful Kitchen is one of the best looking Chinese restaurants I've ever been too.  If the food could match that level is would definitely be 5 star review.  You will still enjoy yourself, but I think the atmosphere sets your expectations way too high for the food to impress you."}
{"text":"Went there today when they just started the business. There wasn't a lot of people and the manager was making sexual comments to a female staff, telling her what would be a good looking woman and how all men loves girls with something on the chest, told her to her to check the history book to see how true it is.

The food is average but I would not go there anymore."}
{"text":"Been here twice and it's not all that great. The first time I came it was pretty full so we were seated at the booths. As mentioned by other yelpers it's extremely awkward. The service was indifferent which was fine by me since I expected it from this sort of establishment. The food was mediocre at best. I ordered the \"choose your own noodle soup combination\" for $8. I had the peppercorn pork soup base with wonton, beef brisket with rice noodles. The soup base was watery. Wonton wasn't anything special, brisket was meh. Boyfriend ordered the pork chop with rice in brick toast. I thought the sauce was kinda odd, at first I couldn't put my finger to it. Then I realized it tasted like the sauce you put on chicken balls. Overall the first experience would garner a 2-2.5 stars. 

Second experience was horrible.  I came on a Saturday at 3ish.  That's basically tea time and it wasn't even half full. I ordered the baked bolognese spaghetti. Man it was pretty nasty. Refer to the attached pictures. Obviously the cook didn't even bother straining the pasta water and just dumped the spaghetti in the casserole and dumped the sauce on top then in the oven it goes. Well the end result is half a bowl of pasta water which dilutes the bolognese sauce and overcooked mushy spaghetti. I couldn't even eat half of it because it was so mushy and inedible. It's a shame because the bolognese sauce was decent. I probably wouldn't come back again since there's just too many choices around this area with better food."}
{"text":"This place is a modern HK tea cafe...a menu with a twist!

I wanted to come here mostly for the brick toast with pork chop and ketchup sauce on fried rice..it was delicious!..but very filling..and greasy... definitely could feed 3-4 people.

This place also has afternoon tea specials that come with a beverage, great value... as a nice bonus, you can choose a dessert (1/4 of a waffle with ice cream or mango pudding).

Overall, this place is great for typical fried rice, noodles, snack dishes...I don't know if I would come here for the dinner seafood dishes."}
{"text":"I like this place as it always has suprises for me. The food is very authentic to South East Asia, especially congee /soup. Not a lot of Hong Kong style cafe in Richomd Hill could make the taste as such. Price range is pretty decent."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant a couple of times after they change their Chinese name to 'Michelin'. The first couple of time was good. However, this last time was very disappointing. Our order was cold and it took a long time to come. Worst of all, I found a cockroach under my shrimp dumpling. A total turn off. They apologized but only 10% off was offered. This is supposed to be a high class restaurant. I will not go here ever again."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night for dinner, place was packed, we were seated promptly.I sat there for a good 10 minutes before someone came over to see if I ordered tea.Had to flag down someone to place our order, we ordered the set dinner for 6, the 4 stars is for the food, we especially enjoyed the curry Crab, the place is short staffed, for a higher end restaurant it needs to have better service to match."}
{"text":"Lots of selections. I would definitely like to come back to try a bit more items. 

We ordered K01 Fried Taiwanese vermicelli with dried scallop & chicken. The noodles were a bit dry. Fried shrimp was tasty. Service was extremely fast (food arrived in 5 mins) and the waiter was pleasant and helpful when it came to what to order. I would love to come back for the baked spaghetti bolognaise... my usual favourite at these hk cafe type restaurants."}
{"text":"Everything is well, good food, good service but they took my favorite dim sum off the menu. The only complaint I have is they tend to seat some customers or friends quietly right away behind the front desk while all others get a number outside to be called. This is more obvious during the early dim sum section before 11am when these \"special VIPs\" stand close to the tables to avoid attention while you are eating. I'm not sure if this is an issue with the receptionist or all the staff. This makes waiting outside for a minimum of an hour absolutely meaningless and unfair. I hope the management will rectify it."}
{"text":"Nothing gives me more grief than billing dispute, as it is usually a sign of dishonesty. Unfortunately I experienced it during today's visit to this restaurant. They have dim sum special of $2.99 per dish before 11am. The waitress forgot to enter 1 dish on initial order. After our food arrived, we realized one was missing and asked the staff to re-order it. But because the re-order took place after 11am, they treated it as a full price dish at $5.20. In short, they charge their customer more even though it was their own fault and shortcoming that made it happen in the first place"}
{"text":"Second time here, got three dishes for three people. I had the brick toast baked rice last time and felt it was too oily for my tastes, so I decided to try something healthier this time. 

Steamed HK noodle roll - good value and good quality. Better than most places, and it keeps the tradition of the dish as it came with toothpicks to eat it with.

Liver and kidney congee - the congee's presentation was unique as it came in a stone pot. It seems like they cook the congee again in the pot since it was bubbling, and the pot was quite hot, which is nice. However, the taste was a little starchy, and doesn't really compare to the actual congee places. I was a bit disappointed since the name is ??? but the congee wasn't up to par despite the appearance.

Brisket Noodle Soup - Not bad, average like other HK diners.

I would come back again though, there's other menu items I want to try and the environment is quite nice and modern (the tap4deal is cool!)"}
{"text":"After renovation they serve very decent dim sum and good quality of tea. After eating I didn't get the thirst compare to other dim sum restaurant. Not only dim sum is great. Dinner is definitely worth while to try. Price is reasonable for that quality."}
{"text":"food is okay but they put a lot of effort on their design! they used to have curvy cups for milk tea and coffee before!"}
{"text":"went there a few times. First, we ordered the lobster lunch set for $29.99. It comes with lobster E-noodle, a plate of veggie and a pot of congee. They will put the live lobster in the congee in front of you. I think this is good value. On top of this set, we also ordered one set lunch - hoi nam chicken rice ($8.99). This comes with a drink. I personally think this one is soso and will not order again. Second time I came with friends and we ordered the noodle lunch special where you can pick 3 types of toppings for $8.99. This is not bad. Service is great and I don't mind to go back again."}
{"text":"I think they're no longer under the same management as before. Now you can expect lousy service and so so food. I am done with it. 
AVOID."}
{"text":"My mom took me here with much excitement has this has been her recent frequented restaurants among her friends and herself. She says the steamed rice with pork neck is the most excellent, but by the time we got there at 10pm, we were told it was not going to be served given that they close at 11pm. We instead opted for the pork neck stir-fried with xo sauce, stir-fried peapod leaves with garlic, and a seafood congee with melon. The pork neck was great but most of the dishes were filled with filler veggies, perhaps expected since the meat is quite expensive. My mom said the pork neck rice is better. The peapod leaves was cooked really well, with high heat but the garlic not burnt. The congee was good.

The bill was, however, a bit too expensive. The three dishes ended up being $45 after tax and tips. The veggie alone was $15 and both the other dish was over $10 each. Even the free mango sago dessert at the end didn't justify the price. All in all though, I would want to come back and try a couple of other things, including their various noodles. I really like the ambiance and cuisine.

Cash and debit only

{"text":"Not sure why some ratings are so harsh on this place but it's always packed whenever I go. Their food is what you came here for... Hk style food. I liked their lobster though.  It's a big place so wait time is usually not too long."}
{"text":"Food isn't that good.  Service is terrible and prices are high for the food quality.  The restaurant is huge, so you better pray you get seated somewhere the waitresses can see you or you're never going to get your order in.  The parking lot for this place is also a nightmare on the weekends."}
{"text":"My Wonderful Kitchen under new management with a different Chinese name ??? and a revamped menu. 

We were here for lunch. The food was decent and service was excellent. Menu selection though less than before but still good enough so everyone would find something they like.

Not a bad option if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"One of my favorite \"tsah tsan tangs\" (HK style cafe). Modern trendy restaurant with pink and blue touches that somehow work well together. This place has interactive ipads and kinect at the entrance for kids to play. The food combinations are just as unique as their decor - baked meal in brick toast, lobster yee mein, soft shell crab fried rice, pumpkin congee. Not the best in terms of taste compared to Congee Queen but definitely yummy and makes me want to go back and excited to try another unique dish next time."}
{"text":"Our family visited My Wonderful Kitchen for tea. The dim sum was average. Nothing extraordinary. Decor was nice. Staff refilled tea frequently. 

My parents expressed their disappointment in the shrimp dumplings as they were over steamed.  The shrimp roll was also over cooked. It seems their chef forgot to add salt to the vegetarian dumplings that day. The dish of the day was BBQ Pork. Both my brother and my mom really enjoyed it. With that being said, most of the dishes we ordered were not up to par. Most of the dishes we ordered were not up to par. 

Overall, our experience that day was a little disappointing. Their food left a lot to be desired.  

Pro tip: Flat dim sum rate $3.20 from Monday to Friday."}
{"text":"I used to come here quite often due to the affordable food but lately the service has gotten worse and worse. Wait time for food is incredibly long and I have had a ton of terrible experiences. On chinese new year eve they took our reservation and when we arrived we found out they took many reservations but did not actually reserve any tables. They expected us to arrive and wait with everyone else! And since all other restaurants were full that night, we ended up eating at home because we could not afford to wait the predicted two hours. They also tried to scam us! We ordered chicken wings to go and waited over an hour. After two complaints we finally got it only to realize just before leaving that they only gave us half the order! They told us later that they were going to bring out the other half later but did nothing to stop us when we were about to leave with what we thought was the full order! Not even separate dishes! They gave us 2 chicken wings in a large takeout container!"}
{"text":"the presentation for the dishes here are very good....creative and attractive. 
especially that mountain water chow mein.  but let me tell you.. it looks way better than it taste. 
(tastes pretty bland and oily)

the half loaf bread with curry inside is quite delicious ... you have two options for curry.. red curry which is spicy or regular green curry.   the regular curry option is good.. a little sweet.. but this dish is rich and heavy.

tilapia in broth is a great deal... 13 dollars or so for a whole tilapia and presentation is very nice... i thought it tasted okay.. kind of what you expect.  you can skip the chicken wings .. they are not great.. deep fried chicken wings that are tossed in tasteless chilli oil is what it taste like.

the vegetable dish we ordered was surprisingly quite good.. not too oily.. and portion was large.  

the deep fried mushroom in spicy salt is not bad but a little too much batter.

i would come back only for their tea time special... or if im trying to impress someone with the presentation of their dinner items."}
{"text":"At first glance, My Wonderful Kitchen ??? looks like your standard congee and noodle place but it you look at their menu carefully, there's quite a few Hong Kong café specials that I have never see in Toronto.

Red Bean & Grass Jelly Freeze $3.95
~ Before all the fancy bubble teas, I remember having this.
~  I just happen to be craving for this and this was just perfect dessert in a cup. ~ Perfect proportion, the red bean wasn't made too mushy or sweet and a firmer grass jelly (compare to the softer ones in bubble teas) to give you something to chew on. 
~ Love the ice cream and the big mount of crush ice on top which was perfect when mixed up together and melted a bit so you can actually drink through the straw.


Deep Fried Fish Skin $2.95
~ The best thing you can get for that price really, we weren't expected such a huge plate. 
~ You basically dip it in the soup before eating it and that's the way to go but I know a lot of other places that don't serve it with the soup. 
~ Dipping it right before eating just give it the extra flavor without turning it soggy like for say with a sauce on top.

Baked Rice w/ Tomato Sauce Pork Chop served in Bread Loaf $8.95
~ Basically it's a deep fried brick toast that's been hollow out to fit the rice inside.
~ This is an super indulgence / carb overload dish. 
~ The bread was crispy and added a lot of texture, 
~ That aside the basic was done really well, the fried rice with egg wasn't oily and dry as it should be while the pork chop was fatty and moist and the tomato sauce was perfectly on point.
~ Even without the fancy brick toast, I would happily order their baked pork chop rice which is my all time Childhood favorite.

Instant Noodle w/ Pork Jowl in Cheese Sauce $7.95
~ This sounded good but thought the cheese was just salty with not much flavor but with their chili oil, it's perfect.

 Deep Fried Chicken Wings w/ Chili Pepper (6pcs) $5.95
~  This is so perfectly crispy, moist, spicy oily goodness. 
~ A glass of cold beer and this would make a perfect night.

Verdict :
~ Love everything we had and will definitely be back for more.
~ Portion are rather big, so best for sharing.
~ Great for family since they have a bunch of bigger tables and got something for everyone's taste.
~ Menu have both traditional Chinese Dishes and also some more adventurous ones."}
{"text":"My good friend is the interior designer who redesigned My Wonderful Kitchen recently.  When the restaurant reopened, he invited me for a viewing and we also had dimsum there.  
I have to say without bias that it really is one of the most beautiful and artistic chinese restaurants i have visited in my life.  The setting is dazzlingly elegant and clean.  
More importantly, the food.  I ordered my usual beef tripe and chicken feet.  I judge dimsum based on these two dishes as sometimes beef tripe can be tough to chew, and the sauce can be weird with the chicken feet.  I am happy to say that everything we ordered tasted really wonderful indeed.
The wait stuff were professional and efficient.  The food and tea were served promptly.   Above all, the price was quite good and affordable as well.  
I hope the staff will keep this restaurant fresh and beautiful for a long time to come so that diners can enjoy both the food and the environment thoroughly."}
{"text":"Location:
This place is within walking distance to my house, so there is zero parking anxiety.  I do know there is a lot of parking.  Behind you cn find a wee parking garage and you can park in the lot next door and take a (not so) secret staircase to get to here.

The building in on highway 7, you can tell newbies (I did it too so I'm not judging) because they come around to the highway 7 side and try to get in.  There's no door there, it's around back.  

Decor:
The place is bright and modern. as you are ushered into the main dining room you pass by booths that are always filled with people, tables loaded with delicious looking and amazing smelling dishes.  I found my self wondering what wonderful things these people were eating.  in the main dining room you have the option of round tables, booths, or the booth/table hybrids.

Menus are in english and cantonese.. The decor is nice.  They have a neat wall that's covered in cutting boards. The tables are close together but not jammed in like you find at some other restaurants.  This is a nicer place, someplace you bring people you like.

Food:
The food is great.  There was a special on a chicken in wine soup.  I was just recovering from a cold so we got it.  Kinda neat. They brought out a hot plate, the kind with a fire, and then put a covered pot with a clear liquid and some twigs and berries in it.  Had it boil up for a while. Then the guy tell my friend to watch out. Bam!!! GIANT FIRE BALL!!  He set the liquid on fire.  It was pretty awesome.  

Dinner AND a show!  

Talk about a show, they brought out black chicken,  Never had that before. Raw it looked a bit like eggplant while cooked it looked a little bit like the creature from alien. 

I seriously love the restaurants in my neighbourhood. 

We also had sweet and sour pork. Served in a PINEAPPLE.  Nice.  Also had a vegetable dish with some beige sauce and pumpkin or some other squash.  It was delicious. Would have never ordered it on my own. Yum.

My favourite was the salty spicy tofu. Will be ordering that every time I go.  Finally we also got a hotpot rice, with chicken.  It came last when we were almost done.
I have to say every thing was delicious. 

Staff:
The staff were great.   They wear neon name tags. Lighted up. Lots of staff. 

Verdict:
I give this place two thumbs up. :)"}
