{"text":"Honestly, I went off Urbanspoons recommendations more than Yelp this time as there was only one review.  Staff was very pleasant.  Pizza was tough and chewy.  Ordered medium spicy wings and they came with no spice but it was the highlight because they were not greasy.  Celery was crisp and fresh and ranch sauce was not bad.  We rarely have leftover pizza but tonight I tossed out more than half of it.   Sorry, but won't return."}
{"text":"If you're from Buffalo, NY the name should look familiar and this Jacobi's definitely lives up to the name. It is the best (and as far as I can tell only) place in southeast Vegas to get a true Buffalo style chicken finger sub (even with blue cheese on request!), and their pizza is fantastic - they even have the Buffalo famous beef on weck sandwich! Every time we go, the service is great and the staff is always good to talk to - a real down home feel. Between the great food and the great staff, we have become regulars and I think if you try them you will be too."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Silverado Ranch!  My husband, who is from Buffalo made me try it, said it would change my life and it did.  Great crust, great sauce, cooked properly and fast friendly service.  I also tried the chicken finger sub, delicious, great roll the sub is served on, I would try all their subs!  The prices are reasonable, the service is great and they have free delivery.  Check it out, your mouth will be happy!"}
