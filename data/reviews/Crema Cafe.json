{"text":"Below average food experience for me and good for my GF. I took my breakfast sandwich back after it was more lettuce than substance and was just not good at all and it was replaced with a weak, unflavorful helping of the omlette special. Very underwhelming food. Young wait staff was unorganized and slow. But were very friendly. Check it off the list. Over rated in my opinion. Marigold, Bluefies, Hubbard Ave are WAY better in all areas. Especially, in the overall food quality, consistency catagory."}
{"text":"Discovered Crema Cafe via Yelp this weekend. Went there for lunch on Friday - it was yummy. My wife spotted the baked oatmeal on the bunch menu and we went back the next morning after she dreamed about it. It lived up to her expectations."}
{"text":"Didn't let us have breakfast, because breakfast closed 4 minutes before we ordered, and we were waiting in line for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Crema is a great little place squeezed onto the end of a strip mall. They really make the most of this space - nicely-appointed interior and great food. I had the best waffle of my life here. I don't know how they made a waffle that stood head and shoulders above every other waffle I've had in my life, but they did. It was ... succulent. The texture was perfect. Plenty of plump, juicy blueberries. A cup of great coffee (Alterra's, from Milwaukee) to go with it. Reasonable prices, friendly staff. Not much here that I could criticize ..."}
{"text":"My first time here and I was greeted by a Super friendly staff! I had some iced tea and a rhubarb oat bar that was AMAZING! I will be back for more! Their breakfast and lunch menu looked so delicious!"}
{"text":"Fungus scrambler! Need I say more? It was delicious and fresh. You can actually taste the freshness! It's something that I couldn't get enough of! Even though I stay about 25 minutes away, it was worth the drive. You'll be in for a treat and I mean a real treat! I couldn't complain about the price really, great food at average price. You'll be amazed! Compared with other breakfast joints, there's plenty of seating and parking. Considering the joint is in a plaza. I was unable to try the bluebird since I was there only on breakfast."}
{"text":"I recently stopped in for the first time and was fairly impressed. I recommend the organic roast beef sandwich...very tasty!"}
{"text":"Must stop! If your into a unique breakfast and not your typical eggs and bacon joint, it's for you. Had their special which was a buffalo chicken hash with eggs. Was not disappointed! Their muffins and pastries were awesome too. Got a couple of coffees and a green smoothie to go, and wish I would've got two."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Dropped in on my way through Madison because of other reviews. We both had bluebird sandwiches. The person I was with added Mushroom soup which smelled so good that I stole a taste....it tasted freshly made. 

The downside to Crema is the atmosphere. IMO, it was sort of dumpy looking...it was clean, but the decor is not to the level of the food."}
{"text":"Love this place. The steak and egg breakfast sandwich is my favorite but the breakfast sandwich with bacon is really great, too. The coffee is always excellent and staff are knowledgeable and friendly."}
{"text":"The breakfast sandwich here is amazing, and a couple others are good. I've learned to avoid their specials - they always read incredible, but they never taste as good. The baked goods are generally not worth it."}
{"text":"After hearing how great Crema was from friends and family, I was very excited to try it. However, I was disappointed. I ordered the sweet potato hash for breakfast this morning, which by the way is half sweet potato and half russet. It came with two eggs cooked any way, and for an additional $3 you can get turkey sausage or bacon. I opted for the sausage and I'm glad I did - the potatoes tasted like absolutely nothing (there was no seasoning on them, maybe not even salt or oil, hardly a hash) and my eggs, which I ordered poached, had an off sour taste. Maybe they squeezed lemon on them, but that's not what it tasted like to me. The best part of the meal was the sausage and the wheat toast, both of which were decidedly average. The place is clean and the prices are good, and the baked goods look amazing, so I may be back to try those, but life's too short for such completely bland food as I had this visit."}
{"text":"Can get super busy on the weekends so I like to just get food to go... The Ham and Jam is easily the best egg sandwich ever!!"}
{"text":"The Bluebird sandwich is my all time fav! Highly recommend  any of the homemade soups. Great locally owned place that makes great coffee too!"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious but the seating and service leave a little to be desired.  I think this is a great place to stop on the weekdays and to get something to-go on the weekend. You can generally expect a line and a wait for one of the tables to open up. not ideal for larger parties. If you want a leisurely chat it is probably best to go to a place that is less packed on a weekend."}
{"text":":(  I have to start off with a sad face.

I love the concept of this place.  I love local organic foods and I am glad that they feature local farms here.  Everything about that idea is a 10.

But I was sipping my mocha and I felt something hit my lip.  I looked down and it was a dead fly.  I am still traumatized.  They made me a new one, but they really should have refunded me.

I am still scared.  And scarred.

Husband ordered the Farmer's scramble and they brought him the Fungus scramble.  He had to get to work so he didn't say anything and very much enjoyed it anyway.

I think the food here is wonderful but I am not sure the people at the counter really care.  I can deal with that.  But the wrong order, the fly, the flies buzzing around me, it was just a bit much.  (And my mocha fly was IN there, I would have known if it just flew in- it was IN my coffee :(  )

I think they make great coffee and I really wanted this place to be (and still do) all it can be, but I am afraid it misses the boat.  Plus it is my birthday :( / :)"}
{"text":"Almost all of their ingredients are locally sourced. I've even seen a farmer in his overalls hand deliver his goods to the café. Great food and coffee. A friendly atmosphere.  Oh,and their \"Ham and Jam\" sandwich is hands down the best thing I've ate in Madison over the past year. It's amazing. Great for breakfast or lunch...or dinner or for a snack or twice a day...seriously. You should try one.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Delicious French toast! Wish they served it all day on the weekend. Oh, and the Collectivo is soooooo good!"}
{"text":"This used to be a \"discovery\" in Madison as it's tucked away in a strip mall on the east side, but now it's all my friend's destinations for awesome sandwiches and solid brunch.  The Bluebird is my all time favorite, but the Artimelt hits the spot too.  The breakfast sandwich is one of the best in Madison with it's great combination of cheddar and scallion cream cheese.  If you have kids - go here.  There are always kids and they have little bags with Mr. Potato heads in them to keep the munchkins happy.  Serve Alterra coffee, solid.  This is one of my stops on my \"must-eats\" in Madison."}
{"text":"Sometimes awesome, sometimes ok. I'm in love with the staple breakfast sandwich and the doughnut muffins. The specials for brunch can be hit or miss. I love the staff and the space."}
{"text":"Best Chai I've had in Madison, spicy, flavorful, not watery even without ordering no water. 
You can tell it is a local coffee shop when the guy at the counter tells you what's good. The register was great even though I entered three minutes prior to closing, they still served me. The prices were WAY better than Starbucks. They do have outdoor seating, and there is a bench if you are like me and end up there right before they close up. The indoor ambience was very nice. I'd definitely visit more if I lived in the area. 

They do close at 3:30, so not great for dinner. :)"}
{"text":"Crema Cafe is great for a number of reasons.

1) In the summer, they have outdoor seating.
2) Dogs are welcome in the outside area.
3) Their scrambles are always delicious.
4) They use locally sourced ingredients.
5) Staff is friendly.
6) Tasty pastry."}
{"text":"The east side has no shortage of great restaurants... this is one of my favorites for breakfast. Big fan of the blueberry pancakes. The atmosphere is cheerful and fun, and a great place to spend a Sunday morning."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time late on a Sunday because a lot of other brunch places had already closed and we saw all the positive Yelp reviews.
The space was very open and had fun decorations on the walls.
We got the open faced frittata and the killer scramble. They were both very solid dishes and were appropriate sized for the price. I also loved their huge variety of hot sauces!
I'd definitely come back again to try some of their lunch dishes and baked goods."}
{"text":"Noisy, crowded, dirty. My egg salad sandwich was just ok and definitely not worth &8! Came with horrible seasoned tortilla chips. Kids turkey sandwich probably best thing on the menu. There are so many other better choices!"}
{"text":"Comfy atmosphere and good food. Sustainable. Local. Organic."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the gobbler and the bluebird sandwiches they are amazing... I only been to this place twice and fell in love.. I highly recommend this place to anyone the staff seem friendly and the place is very clean and well kept right in a small shopping mall on the end.. I will be going back very soon, Do to the fact that i will no longer live in Madison we only have a few week left i am going to crave the bluebird best chicken salad sandwich i  have ever had i will be very disappointed when i leave the town wish they had a location were im going..."}
{"text":"Really like the sandwiches here.  Unique recipes.  Get there on the weekends for brunch and some interesting specials.  Haven't had a bad meal here yet."}
{"text":"I have visited Crema Cafe twice and am so hoping they open a restaurant on the west side! This place is amazing! I love that most items come with a small salad and I appreciate that most ingredients are locally sourced. We will keep going back- the whole family loves it!"}
{"text":"Brought my baby, and was very pleased to see tons of other babies both inside and outside the cafe (I'm sure this is related to it's proximity to Happy Bambino).  Find your own table, and go up to the counter to order.  
It took me quite a while to find the high chairs and no employees were free to help me.  They were very busy, yet not all the tables were full.  It was very loud.  Very loud.  Mostly due to all the children inside.  The floor was filthy.  I mean FILTHY.  My baby threw his toy on the floor and I wouldn't give it back to him despite his screaming, filthy.  
I ordered a Chai and the artichoke sandwich.  The chai was standard.  It didn't make go YUMMMMMYYYY!!!!!!!!! like chai sometimes does.  The sandwich was actually super yummy, especially the cheese.  
The breakfast menu looked better, so I would love to return here some time during breakfast hours with my husband (hint hint, honey).  
The employees could use a brief referesher course on friendliness/personability (like looking at customers when they are speaking to you, smiling) and cleaning/ sweeping.  I didn't use the bathroom so I can't comment on that.  
If you're obsessed with cleanliness like I am, you might be slightly disgusted by this place like I was, but the food is so good, I'm going to give it another chance and hope that the kitchen is tidier."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I just had lunch here, and everything was top-notch. We shared The Gobbler and The Balsamic Beef. Both were great. The thing that put the Gobbler over the top was the goat cheese and whatever subtle spice was included.

The sandwiches were complemented by a side of chips that we quickly realized were homemade Doritos, but so much better than the real thing.

We also had the kale and broccoli cheddar soup, which was dynamite. In addition to clearly being homemade and crafted with care, it also had a nice chipotle kick at the end.

In addition to a quality glass of iced tea, we shared a mug of white chocolate cherry latte. It was great and not too over-the-top."}
{"text":"Highly recommended. Came in one day when they were apparently having problems in the kitchen: they compensated for slow service and proactively gave us $10 gift card to come back. Even on the \"off\" day, the food tasted amazing. Came back, enjoyed breakfast on a different day, and food again was superb. Great breakfast stuff ranging from savory to sweet."}
{"text":"Everyone that works there is SUPER nice. Prices are reasonable. 

GET the breakfast sandwich. I love breakfast and their breakfast sandwich is probably the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had. 

The only thing I've had there that I really didn't like was the salmon scramble thing. Its not that great. 

They also just expanded so there's plenty of room for larger groups."}
{"text":"I had a similar experience as some other of the reviewers. The service is bad. With 2 people in front of me, it was a 10 minute wait to place my order. The wait for the food was not beyond expectation, but when you order soup and a salad, silverware is expected, but the server forgot then got annoyed when I asked for utensils and more napkins. 

The Hoppin' John soup was tasty. The Hot Chick was satisfying, too. The fruit that came with the kid's sandwiches was unexpected and very good; pomegranate and kiwi! My kids loved it. 

I will go back because of the location and the food, but I now know what kind of service to expect. I can deal with it."}
{"text":"A nice little happy place. If you're into kindness, visit. Beautiful view of Lake Monona. Bonus is the support for local artists."}
{"text":"One word. Bland. The menu is exciting but it's a mouthful of tasteless food.

Cute atmosphere. Very kid friendly"}
{"text":"Crema Café is a fabulous place.  It is an intimate, sophisticated yet casual little space, the only thing of its kind on the east side of Madison.  The menu is fantastic, quirky items made from fresh, local ingredients.  The flavors are excellent.  The coffee is the best cup you can get anywhere around.  As for the staff, they seem genuinely happy and are friendly but not artificial.  If you are looking for a place that feels urban and intelligent and has great food, coffee and a nice atmosphere, Crema is it."}
{"text":"The food was ok, when the menu says a salad I was expecting a salad not just greens, that should be clarified on the menu. If you are vegan though this is not the place. My main concern is the cleanliness we had to ask for a table to be wiped off there were several to choose from but all were dirty and there appeared to be ample help behind the counter, the bathroom was dirty since it is a shared bathroom someone should be checking on that while their severing customers and why is there so many dead bugs on the windowsill."}
{"text":"Good food in Madison?! Somewhere besides Magnus?! Who woulda thought it was possible. Coffee is excellent, the Gobbler was maybe the best sandwich I've had in a long ass time... only comparable to Jerry's Sandwiches in Chicago (on Madison St., not the one in Wicker Park). Service was quick and cute... what's not to love about this place! For once Richard Richardo and I agree on something!"}
{"text":"A small but excellent menu.  I went for breakfast and had the egg samy which was a fried egg on a toasted ciabbata bun with white cheddar, fresh greens and mayo.  Simple but delicious.  I'm not much if a coffee drinker but everyone else there seemed to be enjoying theirs.  As for myself I had a mango oj (don't recall the name) smoothie that was also excellent and tasted exactly like a smoothie should.  
The establishment itself was very clean and \"cheery\" in a modern way, think yellows, pear greens and light blues.  
Unfortunately this place is not in the most centralized location and might get looked over, I guarantee if this place was downtown or on wily st it would be booming.  Of course its kind of nice to find a cafe that's not so packed where you don't feel rushed.
On a final note the service was also excellent and the owner also works there and seemed like a nice fellow.  No reason not to give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Finally I got to experience the Crema Cafe and I will be going back very soon! 
 
My mocha was excellent and the breakfast sandwich was super delicious.  The cheddar cream cheese thats on this sandwich is so good and the fried egg and greens on a ciabatta bun just make it a perfect breakfast sandwich in my eyes.  The waffles looked amazing as well and my mate told that the vanilla butter is awesome.  

The interior is very bright and cheery. I love the colorful plates.  If you sit by the window you get a small view of Lake Monona.  

Everyone who was working was very friendly and our breakfast came out quick.  
 
The prices are fair... you can buy anything on the menu for under $10!  Best of all, there are many items that are organic and locally grown. 

We left totally satisfied and I'm sure you will too!  =)"}
{"text":"By far, the best place to eat in town - especially on the weekends for brunch. I wish their lunch menu on the weekdays was a little more gluten-free friendly - I can only eat the salad option that doesn't have nuts (I have a darn nut allergy, too). (Any thoughts of offering the delicious grits for later in the day?) But I am not going to complain because the salad is delicious, too."}
{"text":"Get the HASH! 

So maybe it's because of my limited meat and dairy options, but I've never really had a decent hash. It's always corned beef, (fishy) salmon, or some damn sweet potato boring \"veg\" dish. So I was goofing off at the pottery place next door and realized, \"it's Saturday\", it's still technically \"brunch time\", I've heard \"good things\" so in we walked. Hash was on the menu and my inner self jumped with glee when I realized NONE of the ingredients were on my \"no-no\" list! Here it was, my HASH time had arrived! I went for the kill and ordered the daily hash: Buffalo Chicken Hash. Two eggs - poached of course, and whatever else (a salad?) that come with it.

Well, I am in love with hash - I FINALLY GET IT! The chicken was spiced mild but you could taste it, it was still hot, with a \"mash\" feeling to it, but crisp edges (no idea how they perfected this). The eggs were served on the side, for me to eat separately, but of course, I had to split those beauties on the hash for that pretty (and yummy) yolk effect. Then there was this perfect little salad on the side with onion and a vinaigrette. Now, I was raised by a great German woman who believes in \"mixing\" all the food on the same plate \"cuz it goes in the same place anyway.\" So I mixed just about everything and anything into one bite after the next, like a woman on a food challenge. It was a perfect marriage of hot/cold, crisp/mash, salt/sweet, spicy/savory. 

My other got the Gobbler - wow, very good sandwich! Pictures show it's piled high and another great flavor combination.

I don't know about the other breakfast items, but if you need a place with a great HASH, check this out.

(Thanks Crema for thinking outside the box for us food problem people.)"}
{"text":"I've been to Crema a couple of times.  I stopped going because I got sick a couple of times.  Not sure if something just didn't agree with me, or if product was bad.   So I stopped going. 

My co-workers asked me if I wanted to order lunch from Crema , and I thought to myself, \"it's been a bit.  What the heck. Give them a shot.\"  So stayed on the safe side and I ordered the tomato orzo soup, the bowl. I just got my soup.   Boy am I pissed. I have half a mind not to eat the soup and go back to Crema for my money back. But I'm going to let this go.  If I took a picture of this soup, it would not do it justice.  I wouldn't pay $5.00 for a cup of broth and a tablespoon of orzo.  Oh, yea there was a sliver of carrot and a couple of slices of celery.  Really?  Needless to say, I won't be visiting Crema again.  And when the suggestion comes up to order from Crema, just so none of my co-workers order from Crema, I'm going to buy them lunch and order from someplace else. That's how pissed at I am at this sorry excuse for a soup.  I feel like I go robbed.  Never again."}
{"text":"Yummy sandwiches and smoothies, nice people, great view. Kinda pricy, but the fresh ingredients probably make it worthwhile. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful breakfast/lunch place along Monona Drive, which is a wonderful option for those of us in East Madison who don't want to battle parking fees and traffic downtown. I love their Lake Edge Eggs and Hash and their Fungus Scramble. They always have a scramble of the day, which usually includes some sort of seasonal ingredient. If you find yourself on the East side of Lake Monona, stop here!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Madison, hands down for coffee/breakfast.  Alterra coffee and local ingredients for food is a home run in my book.  The people working are great and provide top notch service.  It's usually my first stop in town on my way in."}
{"text":"Fresh, good food. Just wish there were more \"normal\" items on the menu. Also the young cashier was so chatty with her coworkers that I had to stand there awkwardly for a minute after paying to ask her a simple question. I recommend the food though. You can tell they make it with love."}
{"text":"Very good food but I had to take off a star because their latte is so weak it is insane. I ordered tea and it was stronger than my husbands latte. We had to go out and Get coffee at caribou afterwards."}
{"text":"We had boxed lunches from Crema for a meeting lunch.  Stellar!  The seasonal salad was cannelloni beans, red onion, diced carrots and an awesome vinegar dressing.  This was my favorite item in the box which included a great roasted veg sandwich, awesome lime-ish seasoned chips and a cookie.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"There is something about Crema that is very inviting. They space is bright with loads of natural light. The furniture is mismatched and a bit funky. There are a few tables adjacent to a plug so it is possible to be on-line. The folks who work there are friendly and helpful.

Today I wanted one of their wonderful Blueberry Oat Pancakes. They were unwilling to make just one. I was super disappointed. I ordered two poached eggs. They were more done then I would have liked. I wish they had asked how I wanted my eggs prepared. The toast came with butter on it. I would have liked to have made that decision myself. I will have to remember to speak up and not wait to be asked.

That said, there is some really wonderful food available. The daily egg scramble can be quite creative and very tasty. I love their bacon! The baked goods are excellent and very fresh. 

I have had three of their sandwiches, The Hot Chick, The Gobbler and The Bluebird. All of them were chock full of locally sourced ingredients and were absolutely delicious. The sandwiches are quite hearty. I always think I will take a half of the sandwich home but before I know it, I have nibbled on the second half until the whole thing is gone. 

Crema can be quite busy on weekends. I am lucky enough to be able to go during the week. Today, I hit the jackpot. Just as I got my food the Isthmus was delivered. To me, that is the perfect treat and it has zero calories to boot!

{"text":"This is a place I always meant  to try when I lived in Madison, but always seemed out of the way.  Lucky for me, I am staying with some friends just up the road whilst on my vacation.

I stopped in for just a cup of coffee and was seduced by the sweet potato hash.  It was fantastic and came to the table nice and hot and fresh.  A little chipotle tabasco, some sourdough toast and I inhaled it but only just a little.

The decor is light and retro-inspired.  As a former diner waitress I found the lively noises of clanking plates, milk frothing and background conversation oddly comforting."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I have been back probably 10 times and enjoyed it every time.  The breakfast is so delish and the smoothies are great as well.  Staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is bright and vibrant.  A good place to stop after a bike ride around Lake Monona"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite neighborhood spots for breakfast!  They have great local fare in a bright sunny atmosphere. The weekend specials are usually really delicious but I usually end up with the lake edge with over medium eggs. The hash has both regular and sweet potatoes and is delicious!!!  

More into the lunch scene?  Then the bluebird sandwich is probably one of the best chicken salad sandwiches in town. The balsamic beef is also another fan favorite!  All sandwiches are served with tasty spiced tortillas chips. 

Collectivo coffee y'all!!"}
{"text":"Crema Crema Crema Chameleon.... Chameleon
This is an oldie but goodie.  I am excited to see that they have doubled their size in the last couple of years, which means business is good.
Coffee, breakfast and lunch are done right here.  Plenty of healthy options for lunch, homemade soups, sammies and salads.
Lunch time is packed so come early if you want a good spot.
Only downside is they close at 3:30pm"}
{"text":"My first time at Crema Cafe I ordered a breakfast sandwich brunch special. It had sprouts, a thin, crispy-fried gooey egg, smoked ham with parts of fat still hanging, plenty of greens, love, peace, and magic in it. It was the best breakfast sandwich I have ever eaten in my entire life. The next eight Sundays or so back at Crema were in pursuit of this elusive, god-like sandwich. 

Here are some tips. If it's a special, which we order most of the time, it will likely come in an interesting form. The other day, the tuna melt lunch special was deconstructed: a scoop of scandalously lemony tuna salad, tart with capers, with a crispy length of baguette, diagonally cut, a pile of arugula, and slices of tomatoes, arranged on a plate. For the unadventurous or unforgiving, I would be wary of ordering specials that don't sound like they should come from a cafe in Wisconsin (e.g. crab cakes, ramen, anything mexican sounding) unless you're willing to live in the mind of the thoughtful and creative chef behind these projects. The scramblers are usually safe bets, but can be bland or boring. The gouda cheese grits, ordered as a side, are sinful. Their pancakes are always good. 

If you're ordering from their regular menu don't poo-poo on the tortilla chip side. I did, and regretted my prejudice after I accidentally ordered some, because they're light and delicately seasoned, just like all their salads. 

Colectivo coffee, don't need to say more than that. Refills are 50c. Fresh squeezed orange juice and grapefruit juice are available. The servers are cheerful and kind, even though we take a few minutes to decide our order at the counter. Also, there is an incentive program, not that we need extra incentive, so don't forget to give them your name when you order."}
{"text":"Fun decor.  Good coffee... but some of the food is a tad more concepetual than needed.  This is definately true of their roast beef sandwich which simply has too many somewhat clashing components.

Having said that, they have marscapone french toast! And a really great chicken salad sandwich... and a kids menu that shows they get kids including a toddler friendly grabber plate."}
{"text":"I was in town for the weekend visiting family. My sister lives down the street from Crema Cafe and we had it two days in a row for lunch! I had the Gobbler and Bluebird sandwiches and they were out of this world! 

The Gobbler has turkey, arugula, goat cheese and a cherry compote. The flavor pairings of this sandwich are amazing. I wish I could get this in Chicago! The blue bird is a chicken salad mixed with blueberries. This was also a tasty sandwich. It is a little heavy on the mayo so calories can add up.

Both sandwiches are very filling and stick with you for the day. The cafe has ample seating and is very cute. When I go back to Madison to see my sister, I will be making another stop at Crema Cafe!"}
{"text":"Terrible service!! We went here with our 1.5yo daughter because everyone said it was kid-friendly. NOT TRUE.

We waited over 30min for food while people who arrived after us were being served.
The staff were not apologetic and when we couldn't wait any longer and asked for our money back, they wanted us to wait because it was \"almost ready.\" I left with our daughter and my husband waited ANOTHER 10 minutes for the food before they finally admitted it wasn't done and gave us our money back. Never eating here again!!"}
{"text":"The food is tied for best breakfast with another place I like to eat.  I had breakfast, and ate the Killer Scramble and Sweet Ginger Crepes.  It was so good, and the temperature of the food was perfect.  I am so happy I ate there."}
{"text":"Very dirt tables and torn chairs. The food was nothing special. Ordered over medium eggs and they were runny. Coffee was very good and the fact that they use organic products is a plus."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I've been here twice - once with colleagues for lunch and once with a friend, also for lunch.  Both times, my food has been amazing.   Nice atmosphere to eat, although it can get crowded around lunch time.  I recommend their soups and any of their sandwiches.  Both times the ingredients tasted fresh.  Some other reviewers mentioned a long wait - I did not experience that either time.  We probably waited about 10-15 minutes for our sandwiches and soups, which seemed reasonable to me!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, the Farmers Omelet was delicious! eggs were cooked to perfection- only complaint would be the salad that came on the side was waaaay too salty."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Saturday morning and the place was decent.  Comparable to Manna on the north east side but not the same quality level in the food.

Drink order was wrong, not a big deal.  I had some pancakes with granola and bacon.  They were interesting but rather dense and the granola was not a positive addition.  Bacon seemed medium quality, not as good as many Madison places.

Ambiance was a bit more strip-mall than some of the other breakfast places in the area.

I don't eat out in Monona a lot, if I did this would probably be one breakfast place I would hit but it was not worth driving from the willy area with so many other options."}
{"text":"Today was my second time at Crema. Both times I have been there, the meals have been divine. The first time I ate there, I had breakfast, today I had a sandwich with artichoke, spinach, cheese and mayo. Both were excellent.  Everyone in my party today also loved their meals. The apple pancakes, which were the special of the day, were melt-in-your mouth amazing and the cute rainbow of fruit served on the side was clearly very fresh. I love Crema's small, cozy atmosphere, the fun colorful plates, and of course, their delicious food.

Sadly, however, I cannot give Crema a five-star review.  I was extremely disappointed today at the customer service and how a mistake was handled. When our food was brought to our table, an order of children's pancakes was missing.  We asked the server about it.  In my opinion, his response should have immediately been, \"I am so sorry, I will get those right out to you.\"  Instead, he said he would have to look at the ticket. A couple of minutes later he returned to let us know that there had been only one order of pancakes on our menu. This was a error on their part.  We ordered two - one apple, one regular. There were clearly two children standing with my husband when he ordered.  Then, again, instead of immediately getting us our pancakes, the server suggested that my husband should go and place another order.  So my husband waited in line (behind five other patrons - it was lunch on Mother's Day) to order the same pancakes that he had previous ordered.  By the time he finally got back to the table, his meal was cold, and by the time my son's pancakes finally arrived, the rest of us had finished our meals. This was their mistake, yet we were the ones that ended up with late food, cold food, and having to stand in line multiple times.  No one apologized. It was just a bummer - and the table next to us had an issue with their order, as well.  

Food wise - this place is perfect.  I might suggest they spend a tad bit more time working with their servers on listening and how to handle errors."}
{"text":"Fantastic Bluebird Sandwich. Relax and casual dining."}
{"text":"Been back to Crema a bunch of additional times, and now love it. Their Gouda grits are to die for and they have a drink called Coconut Crema that is amazing. Also, the staff is awesome! 

I've heard their Bluebird sandwich is excellent, but my allergy to blueberries prevents me from being able to consume it. The Gobbler sandwich is my favorite sandwich at Crema and has been consistently excellent.

Such a lovely place for weekend brunch!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, nice people, simple good food.  One of my go-tos.  Downside: a little noisy.  It's right by Happy Bambino (which I love), but there are a lot of babies.  Upside: I like babies."}
{"text":"Was hoping for a little more... based on reviews and the crowd when we first attempted to eat here...  the infamous sweet potato hash was a little underwhelming ... with a tad too much sage, and served lukewarm.   The farmers scramble boasted \"aged cheddar \" was nearly non- existent.   Sour dough bread was flavorful,  but dry... learned to late that jam was available,  but you have to ask behind the counter ... 1 \"unisex\" restroom ...  The Silver lining of our experience was a very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I want to crema cafe tired after just getting into Madison after a really early morning flight. Eating there really cheered me up. I got their weekend scramble which that week was a crab scramble. It was very tasty and they had a wide assortment of hot sauces. I will say the portions aren't huge, so if you are really hungry you might want to add a side."}
{"text":"The good thing about this restaurant is the food is all local. But unfortunately nothing to write home about. I got the sausage, spinach, aged cheddar scramble. The spinach wasn't\"fresh\" cut but was long and stringy like a frozen whole leaf spinach would be. Not much cheese noticed. Bread was blah and you had to ask for jam from behind the counter. They took a small container of cold jam out of the refrigerator. Small side of greens was fantastic. It was an expensive breakfast. They should have two $$ under their listing, not one. To top things off they had one unisex bathroom."}
{"text":"I've been going to Crema for years and they continue to be one of my favorite cafes! I know I'll always find healthy, organic options. It's kid friendly, bright, the people are super nice, and the food is great. The killer scramble is my absolute favorite there but it's always so hard to decide. They have a handful of specials on their board to keep things mixed up and it's the type of place where I could eat half the menu. They make healthy food taste sooooo good. I love that there always a handful of toddlers for my daughter to chatter with and that it's the type of place that you feel like anybody and everybody is welcome. I would highly recommend checking them out."}
{"text":"The coffee here is amazing. As a former barista, I know I can comfortably order an espresso drink and not worry that it will be pulled incorrectly, which I can't say about all the coffee shops in Madison. The food is great, especially for a cafe setting. My favorite thing about Crema cafe though is the warm atmosphere. You can really just sit and relax and feel like you're at home, but with coffee and food most people couldn't get in the comfort of their house. The staff is always friendly every time I go in, and they love chatting with customers. I definitely consider Crema to be one of the top coffee shops in Madison, and being on the opposite side of town, I still do my best to make it over there."}
{"text":"My husband and I were on our semi-seasonal trip to Madison recently and enjoyed a great breakfast courtesy of Crema. I opted for buying a Groupon a few weeks prior to our trip, which made the experience even better. 
I have to admit: I am forever in love with the salad over potatoes approach Crema Cafe has enlisted as a side with breakfast. I had the Fungus Scramble with a mini donut muffin. It was another quiet breakfast as my husband and I occasionally made eye contact with smiles of approval. 
With a great view of the lake near the ever-so-bike-friendly town of Madison, you'll find Crema Cafe a treat."}
{"text":"I was in town visiting my Father and Grandmother. This place harbored me during my 2 weeks and offered me welcome respite from the harsh reminders of my guilt-riddled childhood.
I would order a latte and stay for hours while I read comics, checked my email, and drew in my sketchbook.
The espresso is definitely the best in the area, however I believe that the true charm of Crema comes from it's awesome sandwich menu.
Their Tuscan is nothing short of epicly delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment of eating it.
There is tons of seating, and I never felt cramped other than during lunch hour.
If you are staying in the Madison/Monona area, it is definitely a place to stop by and bring your friends.
In my personal opinion, it doesn't stack up to the best coffee I've had, but I liked it more than enough to keep coming back again and again on my trip out to the Midwest."}
{"text":"The French toast is amazing here.  Great food presentation.  Quick service and great coffee.  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Kid friendly with toys and everything.
Best food ever.  They use fresh ingredients.  I recommend the ham and jam sandwich in the morning and the artimelt for lunch.  Get a smoothy made with real fruit and a delicious and huge scone.  Service can be a little slow sometimes, but it doesn't matter.  I love them anyway."}
{"text":"Oatmeal is to die for! Had lunch a few weeks ago, too, and the salad and Sammy was awesome."}
{"text":"Avoid the fast garbage food a the McDonald's and Taco Bell's of the worth and take a trip a few miles off the highway to some excellent healthy tasty food. 

Followed the yelper trail to Crema and found a retro vintage fruity gem of a diner. Daughter has the fresh beary French toast and she ate it all up.  I had the farmers scramblers.  Eggs, fresh snasage cheddar. Great toast and a very interesting sweet potato hash brown sides - excellent.  

The coffee was very tasty too!  Add to that young friendly workers - a definite great start to the day."}
{"text":"I first heard about Crema Cafe when Chef Steve sponsored the Madison Social Media Club meeting.  I consider myself a foodie and when he talked about his passion for fresh and local ingredients I could tell he was the real deal.  My boyfriend's parents were in town the next weekend and I decided to take them to Crema Cafe for brunch.  

On the way over I was thinking \"is this a good idea? Will my foodie reputation be ruined because I'm taking a chance on Crema Cafe?\"  

My instincts were right on! There was not a scrap of food left of the table when it was over. With the insanity of the feeding frenzy I can't remember exactly what everyone had, but I ordered a scrambler special, and my boyfriend got a pumpkin latte which was spectacular.  I'm from Virginia so the highlight of the meal was the cheesy grits, which brought my Wisconsin and Virginia world together in a rich and creamy bite.  


 I don't give out 5 stars to just anyone! Crema Cafe is a must try! I"}
{"text":"Highly recommended. I was floored the first time I came in here and have been consistantly impressed since. The mushroom scramble is *so* my fave!

In addidition the staff is alway friendly and kind and the baked goods are enjoyable.

I've seen other reviewers complain about wait time. My personal thought there: Yes, it can get crowded during busy times (like weekend brunch) and service is a little slower, but that happens at ANY smaller, excellent restaurant (Lazy Janes, Mickeys, Weary, etc.). Yeah, there may be a bit of a wait sometimes, but in my experience it's always been worth it."}
{"text":"The Crema Cafe is easy to find and the inside is very inviting. The staff was very friendly and were helpful in choosing a breakfast dish. I ordered a hot chai tea and the fungus scramble with hash. It was delicious! The hash was a little odd, but I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes. I will come back to try more dishes and their lunch menu."}
{"text":"Finally went today. Good, not great. It has a pretty standard coffee shop atmosphere, with some fun designs in the interior. They also are sporting a view of the lake (past the parking lot and road).

The Bluebird sandwich is pretty good. I love how they serve spicy El Ray tortilla chips from Milwaukee. Brings me back. They hit the tap water out of the park.

Service was good, nice people."}
{"text":"The Artichoke sandwich is amazing.  Its a lovely neighborhood kind of place with great service,   The prices are reasonable.  The food authentic -fresh salads, homemade soups.  This is not upscale. It is one of those places that just feel like home."}
{"text":"Great breakfast with reasonable portion sizes. Quick service. Great food from local sources."}
{"text":"I love the food here... However it is always so slow! The counter staff is super slow, getting your food is super slow.  I give it more stars if they stepped up the timing a little bit more."}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise. I wanted to treat a co-worker for a birthday lunch and she selected Crema Cafe. It's at the end of a very unassuming strip mall which has its own parking lot (the strip mall, not the cafe). There were several tables set up outside but we chose to sit inside due to the chill in the air that day. The inside was much bigger than expected with some serious old school chairs and tables that made me nostalgic for childhood. 

Order at the counter, they give you a number and you grab a table. Coffee, water and flatware is self-serve. 

There is a wide variety of options for lunch. My co-worker thoroughly enjoyed the Hot Chick which was chicken, spicy mayo, cheese and bacon. I went with the Roman II which was an outstanding vegetarian option filled with zucchini, roasted red peppers, spinach, cheese and super yummy olive tapenade. The baguette was awesome. The veggies were fresh. Both sandwiches came with seasoned tortilla chips.  

There was a surprisingly large selection of desserts, many of which were gluten-free. Very friendly folks working there. Great little cafe."}
{"text":"How did I never hear of this place while I lived in Madison!? The location has a gorgeous view of the downtown, for starters. The food was fantastic. And despite it being packed on a Sunday afternoon for brunch, we were served promptly. This could have been a favorite if I still lived in town!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and one of the best lunch places in Madison. Owner is a real chef and it shows. Place gets busy at noon so come early."}
{"text":"Wow! definitely a 5 star cafe, tucked into a little shopping center, near Monona. I didn't expect such an excellent shop in such an unassuming spot (and so convenient for me, near the house I could afford!) and I honestly cannot find one single thing about it  I could improve. The coffee was excellent, both in taste, balance, and presentation, and even better was organic AND fair trade. Wow! And it just gets better: loads of other key menu items are local AND organic. Thank the gods! (or whomever.) 

I had a ham sammitch that was delicious, a little sweet, served with spicy chips which are normally not my favorite thing, but balanced the plate perfectly. I also love a menu featuring seasonal stuff, and fresh fruit. Soup was great, can't wait to go back for the smoothies. For the high level of awesome going on, the place is cutey but not at all pretentious, kid-friendly without being zoo-ish, and has a nice view of lake Monona. Anything else I could wish for (belly-dancers, 24 hour service, an archery range, complimentary rickshaw rides...) would be frankly silly to expect. This place deserves to prosper."}
{"text":"I ordered the special of the morning, egg scramble with gruyere cheese, chunks of ham, halves of potato, and great seasoning. It was served with sourdough toast slathered in butter and of course the typical greens it seems all quality brunch places have incorporated into the meal. I also had a large vanilla latte (I'm a broken record), and everything was superb. Of all things I love, it's a dish with cheese and potatoes in it. When I saw the chunks of seasoned potato I knew I was going to fall in love. The ham was great also, salty and juicy and quality.  You can't really top eggs, ham, potato, fancy cheese, and good caffeine.  It's pretty much my ideal breakfast (how many times can I say potato before pissing you off?).....

My third favorite breakfast joint."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch place in Madison. It is really really delicious food. Everything I order is always hot, and cooked deliciously. I usually get the scramble or a smoothie but seriously, everything here is so good. 

It is a perfect place to soak in a busy brunch place by yourself or invite a group of friends and have a good conversation."}
{"text":"Short but sweet. 

Bring your mac. Ambience is perfect for doing work or facebooking for hours. Yes, it's now a verb.

Blueberry chicken salad. It's the only entree I've ever tried because it is so darn tasty. I swap the chips for a salad and throw it on the sammy to feel better about life and the two chocolate chip cookies proceeding the bcs. 

Why not 5 stars? Where the customer service is terrific (the nice man taking orders must also taste test for coffee quality control for as much enthusiasm and zeal pouring out of this guy) a to go order takes longer than a bike ride around Lake Mendota, regardless of how busy or slow. Call it in, yelpers, and enjoy."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, fun vibe, and somedays a wait. But thats what happens when your know for using local ingredients, being creative with them and hitting the spot every time to return for more. I highly recommend

   -Baked oatmeal topped with brown sugar & milk
   -Daily made from scratch bakery
   -Smoked gouda Grits
   -Weekend brunch special (posted on their facebook & twitter the friday before)"}
{"text":"Crema Cafe is an excellent breakfast/brunch spot. We were staying in downtown Madison and took a nice lake/bike trail to Crema and wanted nothing more than a hearty breakfast - they delivered! 

We both got the Fungus scramble. It was delicious and we really enjoyed the fact that the eggs came with a delicious salad. Another highlight was the truffle oil used! 

The only thing keeping this from a 5 star review is that we ordered chai tea, which was listed on the menu as \"chai tea.\" We were assuming this was a loose leaf tea option and not a latte. Much to our dismay, a chai tea latte arrived with whole milk and lots of sweetener. Not a big deal but a little misleading."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, smart prices. Really like the upbeat colors. Staff smile and don't hate being there. Pleasant interaction at the counter. Full...sign of a great restaurant.  Had ham and ham sandwich and french toast, both wonderful. Good coffee."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! Their salads are incredible and their choices for kids meals are delicious - they don't \"kid down\" their food just because its for children. My favorite thing to get is the Hot Chick sandwich - BEST spicy chicken sandwich around (much better than Panera's chipotle chicken). I only wish that they would offer the Hot Chick on weekends when I am most likely to stop there for lunch. I also wish there was more outdoor seating but I understand the small amount due to the space restrictions. Headed there for lunch today!!"}
{"text":"Alright, so I live relatively close BUT this is my FIRST time here!

I had the Farmer's scramble. Now...how do I say this?  It was good, not great. The food was fresh, hot and it didn't weigh me down. It was not greasy and you felt like you got a great value for what you paid. However, it was not spectacular. The flavors were average. Sausage, cheese, eggs. The best part of my meal?  The vinaigrette on the greens. Well, the fact that they put greens on my plate. Thank you for realizing people like balanced meals.

I was annoyed by the refill price for coffee. Why? Not sure, but it seems a little petty. So I ordered a crafted beverage (does this make sense?  probably not.). I had the Sassy Cow Eggnog Latte. Now, I LOVE eggnog, specifically the Sassy Cow option. However, the flavors just didn't merge. 

Will I go back?  Yeah, it was good, not overly pricey."}
{"text":"This place is great. I just loved my breakfast, the Killer Scramble with egg whites.  My husband had the Farmers Scramble also fantastic. My salmon was just the right amount of smoke, the goat cheese the right amount of creamy and the side salad was a perfect addition. We drove today but plan on making this our walking breakfast destination."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast & coffee.  Fresh ingredients, gluten-allergy friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches. This place has ruined me for breakfast sandwiches anyplace else. I had the bacon, egg, frisee with the spicy mayo on an impossibly light, herbed foccacia bun. I might order a breakfast sandwich someplace else, but not without comparing it to this one. 

I've never had a disappointing meal here. I rarely order anything-salad sandwiches, but the bluebird is outstanding. Soups are always good. 

I appreciate the attention to local food too."}
{"text":"Just got done with a weekend breakfast at Crema Cafe. This place does not disappoint. We had the weekend specials (breakfast burrito and the apple cashew pancakes) delicious. This is quite the hidden gem."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for late morning breakfast and the place is ALWAYS hopping! The specials of the day are always a great go-to because of the generous local ingredients and how wonderfully flavorful they are! The staff is always so nice and the vibe is fun...love the eclectic table/chairs and great people watching! Such a great usage of old strip mall space and the fun sidewalk seating! Crema is never a disappointment, just be prepared for a line, tight seating and a bit of a wait for your meal...but well worth it!!!"}
{"text":"I have been trying some different breakfast places, and Creme came up with some high ratings, so I thought why not.

It is a nice enough place for sure, although the seating is a bit limited and you have to hope for some good turn-over on a Sunday morning after ordering your food.  

It is counter service; you order, hope for a seat and wait for your food to come to your table.

I would not call the menu a traditional breakfast place. I really liked my sweet potato hash, but the portion size was a bit small. 

It is a long drive for me, so my return is not imminent, but I would encourages others to try."}
{"text":"Cute Cafe. Location is hidden in a strip mall type of place but with a gorgeous view of one of the lakes. Customer service was hurried, not super friendly, but not rude.

Indoor and outdoor seating available. Order at the counter and bring the number flag to your table so they know where to bring the freshly made food.  The service is fast and people are polite, they don't tend linger, which frees up tables quickly.

Keep your eyes on the specials board, but there is plenty to keep your saliva glands going on the regular menu. Be warned, \"hearty\" may be misleading.  One of my slender friends was disappointed with the size of his hearty crepes and left him hungry and wanting more.

Crepes were properly made and flavorful!

Eggs Scrambler and Bacon - delicious with homemade bread and a side salad was perfect and filling. The balance of eggs and ingredients was nice, especially if you prefer half eggs and half filling. The eggs were moist and not overdone around the filling. LOVED IT!

Crema Lake Edge Eggs - Good, fresh, but the flavors were really nothing too stand out compared to other places around here.

Almond Pancakes were fluffy and delicious - HEARTY and filling. Good source of fiber :)

While waiting for our food we enjoyed a fresh Cranberry Orange Scone and Blueberry square...we got the last one and it wasn't even mid morning. The pastries and baked goods sell out quickly.

I would return if it was convenient, but I wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Totally loved the food and music.  Enjoyed a \"Killer Scramble:\" smoked salmon, sauteed leeks, local goat cheese, 3 eggs, and a perfectly-sized mix of greens with toast on the side. The cup of tea was nice and large--I hate it when breakfast places are stingy on the caffeine.

Music was some lovely acoustic Appalachian-inspired tunage. Set a relaxed mood without being too loud.  It was crowded (so you know it's good), but not clangy and awful like breakfast joints sometimes can be.  The view of the lake is extra lovely, too.

Ample parking. Looking forward to going back for other meals and try out lunch, too!"}
{"text":"The bacon and eggs were great and the coffee was also.. The sandwiches not my favorite. But breakfast is a YES"}
{"text":"First visit to Crema - had heard so many good things.  Visited on a Sunday am around 9:30am, long wait at the counter, however, plenty of seating available inside.  Had the \"Farmers Scramble\" - @ $8 + $2 cup of coffee...unfortunately didn't see the value.  Supposed to be a three egg omelet...quail eggs maybe...chewy toast, served with a spinach salad.  In fairness, probably not my \"cup of tea\".  Food was average at best, service seemed typical Madison \"ho-hum\" lack luster attitude.  Overall just not impressed with the location, food, or service. I can't recommend that you visit"}
{"text":"I REALLY liked the feel of Crema Cafe and I wish I had read the reviews before going. My scramble was good, but unremarkable apart from the unusually large and delicious mushrooms included. I think that they excel at other dishes, including their baked goods. We got a blueberry streusel bar, which was very well done.

I also appreciated the excellent service! It was very relaxing, unusual for a brunch place on a Saturday morning at 11:30. Overall, a great place to have a long brunch savoring your coffee with friends. Next time I'll try the sandwich!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I enjoy the coffee and food.  Great salads!  Friendly staff.  My only complaint is that they close too early for me.  I wish they would stay open until at least 5 PM.  Several times I've had to leave b/c they are closing shop and I end up having to go to the coffee shop down the road.  That one is good too but I'd rather be at Crema."}
{"text":"I withdraw my prior criticism of their coffee. Since then I've had their coffee a few times, and I'm almost certain it was because my first cup happened to be from an old batch. I do try to aim for when they come out with a fresh carafe of coffee so that there's no chance of bad coffee again. Because of that, I'm going to add a final star. Crema Cafe has become my La Rotonde - when I'm bereft of inspiration or motivation, the ritual of driving over, ordering a sandwich and coffee, and watching the crowd swirling around gives me a breath of fresh air."}
{"text":"Definitely a big fan of the Fungus Scramble!  However, my Aunt had the Salmon Scramble and the taste of lox was overwhelming...  Latte could have been stronger.  My Aunt loved the hash.  Overall a good spot."}
{"text":"Stopped here a few times for their breakfast/brunch on the weekends. You can tell its a popular place because there is always a line for ordering. We've gotten lucky by always being able to snag a table, I am sure others may not be as lucky. 

The menu is smaller but every item is perfected, and well thought out. Most if not all the ingredients are fresh and locally sourced.  I've tried the breakfast sandwich, the sweet berry French toast, oatmeal, and their hash. All are delicious. 

The breakfast sandwich is served with a side of greens. I wasn't sure how I'd like the cream cheese on it, but it really made the sandwich. Overall this is my go-to breakfast item.

The sweet berry French toast is made with bread from a baguette which is the perfect balance with something that would normally be overly sweet . It is perfect in every way. Not to mention the portion size is very generous. 

If you are in the area, you should really give Crema Café a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Best. Breakfast. Sandwich. EVER!!!!! No joking, y'all. It's serious goodness - kind of perfect actually. In fact, it's pretty much all I've ever eaten here. It's served on a crispy yet tender ciabatta roll with a generous pile of tangy dressed greens that add a wonderful brightness, a delicious cheddar cream cheese spread that doesn't over power, just the right amount of bacon and a slender egg. The sandwich is balanced and divine. You should really eat one as soon as possible.

I'm not a big fan of their iced coffee, but their Earl Grey tea is fantastic, served in a huge Fiestaware mug, which only adds to the level of happy. Their donut muffins are soft, yummy goodness especially when warm. The service is lovely and the decor is fun with a mixture of retro and new, of which I'm a big fan. All in all, Crema is a nice way to start your morning."}
{"text":"I appreciate Crema for its dedication to locally-sourced, seasonal ingredients, and innovative weekend specials. I love that they list what farms their ingredients are sourced from, and that every weekend they post enticing photos of their specials on Facebook. They always do one savory dish, one sweet dish, and one scramble, and everything I've ever gotten has been extremely tasty! I especially love the greens they often serve with the savory dishes--who said you can't have salad for breakfast?! Oh, and the pastries they have at the counter are always amazing, and I've noticed they have good gluten-free options, if that's a concern for you. Prices are higher and portions are smaller than average in Madison, especially for a place where you bus your own table, but I think this is because they use such high quality ingredients. All that is what keeps me coming back, despite the rather stressful seating arrangement. 

You order & pay at the counter, take a number, and seat yourself, but sometimes after placing your order you realize there are no tables available! The last couple times I have gone I have either had to share a 4 or 6 person table with other diners, or sit at one of the small 2-person tables sandwiched between the order line and the wall, which is not pleasant as you are trying to eat with people's butts directly at face level next to you. I wish they would work out a better seating system, or have their servers ask people who have finished their meals and are just on their computer/reading the newspaper to open the table up for the next customer. 

Word to the wise: on weekends either show up before 10:00, or wait til after 11:30 to beat the rush and get a comfortable table. And check Facebook to scope out the specials before you go!"}
{"text":"I go out of my way to eat at Crema.  Their weekend brunch specials are always appealing and stray away from the regular pancake/eggs that other breakfast places  serve.  Also appreciate them serving and procuring local produce and meats.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Finally made it here for lunch.  Everything was delicious.  Roasted cauliflower soup, artimelt and a spicy chai.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe.  They use my favorite-Colectivo coffee.  I ordered the ham so Gouda sandwich.  It was delicious and I was happily surprised that the ham was hot not cold.  Comes with some pretty amazing chips too."}
{"text":"Crema Cafe's blueberry hill smoothie is refreshing; not too sweet, and has a strong taste of cinnamon and blueberries.  I thoroughly enjoyed this smoothie along with sweet potato hash and fungus scramble during my Sunday brunch visit ...until I found a small piece of bacon hiding in my food.  I'm vegetarian, so this was not ideal.  The surprise bacon, cramped cafe interior and lack of table service made this an experience I would not be eager to relive."}
{"text":"Delicious little cafe in Monona. I came in here 2 weeks ago when I was in the area after reading good Yelp reviews, and I will definitely be back. 

Food: I got the Summer BLT sandwich - major noms. I'm not normally a BLT person but with the lemon aioli, mixed greens, and chewy sourdough bread, I'm very happy I did. SO GOOD. It came with tortilla chips on the side, which were nothing special but good. I believe it was around $10 with tax - a little pricy for a sandwich, but worth it. 

They had some really delicious sounding drinks (fancy lemonades, smoothies, coffees), too. I aaaalmost ordered a chai, but decided not to - I heard them call out several chai teas, so it seemed like a popular choice.   

Atmosphere: Very friendly. I had some trouble making up my mind and the women behind the counter were really nice and helpful. It seems like a fun crowd works there. It was a welcoming environment, with several families with young children there as well. They have a wall for lots of local events and listings near the bathroom. (Random note: the bathroom was really warm. Not anything that would keep me from coming back of course, but much warmer than the rest of the place.) Easy parking and some outdoor seating. It was busy, but not so busy that I had to wait very long for my order (no wait!) or my food (5-10 minutes, max). 

Overall, very cute and inviting local place. I'm excited to come back!"}
{"text":"I visited this cafe after reading the many glowing reviews and was not disappointed. Ordered the baked oatmeal and it was delicious- real ingredients make the difference: cranberries, hulled oats, baked pecans, fresh milk and crumbly brown sugar.  My partner ordered the blueberry waffle with vanilla butter, real maple syrup and candied pecans. Both meals were around $5, portions were healthy sizes and table service was quick and friendly.

Minus one star: for the fly in the restaurant,  the music (strange choice of loud 1970s freedom rock- sort of hilarious at 7am in a cafe inhabited by mostly retired elderly folks), for the girl at the counter who didn't know how to smile or make eye contact, for the slightly cramped table space, for the nearly empty creamer carafe that dumped 900 ounces of half and half into my coffee cup. Man I hate those things.

Bottom line: a true Madisonion treasure tucked away in an unassuming strip mall with great prices, real food, and a little view of the lake."}
{"text":"Good scratch made breakfast grub. Crema clearly has a neighborhood following. A friend of mine has been raving about Crema Cafe for months - so I finally met him for Sunday brunch. 

You order at the counter and grab a table. The food came out in short order. We ordered all sorts of stuff: Donut Muffin, Oatmeal Blueberry Pancakes, Breakfast Scramblers, Bacon, Potato Hash, and Smoked Gouda Grits. 

The scrambler was one of the specials. It came with dressed greens and toast. Although we got one of our orders with the potato hash. The scrambler was tasty with caramelized onions and mushrooms. The salad greens were properly dressed. 

The donut muffin thing was delicious - it's a good thing there was only one left or I could have eaten a dozen or two. 

The grits were creamy, smokey and very rich. The single serving would be fine for sharing.

The Blueberry Pancakes were so tasty that I didn't even have a chance to photograph them. Trust me they were thick cakey suckers dusted with powdered sugar and sprinkled with whole blueberries.  

Crema Cafe is one of those places I've driven by hundreds of times - unless you were a neighborhood local or somebody had bragged about Crema Cafe, I don't think you would find your way. So now that you've discovered it on Yelp go check it out foodie."}
{"text":"Came here on our first visit to madison and still havent been to a better restaurant.  I had a sandwich that was basically artichoke dip on bread - it was delicious!!!  My husband had an egg salad sandwich, which was also quite nice.  I cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really excellent food, good coffee, plenty of other drinks to choose from, yummy pastries, warm atmosphere. 

But the wait. Oh, the wait! There is a long wait EVERY day at lunch time, and I just don't understand it. Yes, as the owner replied to an earlier review, it does take time to prepare quality food. But couldn't something like chicken salad (or egg salad or sliced meats or....) be made ahead of time? So it would take just a couple of minutes to make a sandwich out of it? When it takes 30 minutes, I figure they must be back there killing the chicken as I wait.

Seriously, though, the staff are super friendly and helpful, but have not the tiniest sense of urgency. I think it must be the culture of the place that speed is just not any kind of priority. I will keep going back, but only when I've got time on my hands."}
{"text":"I keep wanting to like this place but they consistently cross flavor lines in my opinion.  I have tried a half dozen items from their menu now and more often than not my taste buds are offended. I feel as though they are constantly striving to create new unique combinations and flavors which is not a bad thing, where they go wrong however is that they constantly allow one flavor or another to completely take over the dish to the point that you can no longer taste anything else.

They definitely use fresh ingredients and there is a couple of dishes that are okay, but they continually offend my taste buds."}
{"text":"This might be my new favorite brunch place. Conveniently located a short but vigorous bike ride away from my new digs, Crema serves up some fresh realness for your AM munchies. The Killer Scramble is highly Rebeccamended because I am obsessed with smoked salmon, and their eggs are buttery and fluffy. The coffee is on point, as are their savory pastries. If you like reasonably priced and delicious breakfast/lunch, try Crema."}
{"text":"I am SO EXCITED about the new brunch menu!  I can't eat eggs, and my boyfriend always wants breakfast (when I have to order off the lunch menu).  I've always longed for their poached eggs, which are beautiful- like tufts of meringue.  But NO  MORE!  I ordered corn meal pancakes, which came with storemade raspberry compote and they were wonderful.  The storemade chicken sausage I was hopeful about, but it had WAY too much fennel and anise for me; the flavor was so overwhelming that I couldn't taste anything else for a few bites afterwards.  They also just leased the space next door, so now there's a TON of tables!"}
{"text":"I always look forward to our trips to Crema on the weekends.  The \"special\" scrambles are always on point and the coffee (Collectivo) is superb.  Everything that comes out of their kitchen is fresh and delivered with a smile.  You can tell, just by being there, that everyone on the staff loves what they do.  In addition, this place is super kid friendly.  A Mr./Mrs. Potato Head for kids available for almost a dozen kids?  Madness.

My only criticism is pointed at their cleanliness.  It IS NOT awful. I just think that there could be a larger effort on sweeping up during the busy times. Not a fan of stepping on someones leftovers.  However, I am a huge fan of the Bluebird.  I wasn't sure why they were selling t-shirts touting them until I had one.  A shirt is in my future for sure."}
{"text":"Poor service. Higher than normal prices and on the day we visited the place was full of flies. This was the first time yelp disappointed us. Can't understand why this place gets high ranking. Could be we caught them on a bad day"}
{"text":"A few months ago I finally came in for lunch.  Now I *crave* the Bluebird sandwich all the time.  It's a chicken salad sandwich, but not just any chicken salad sandwich--it's a tasty chicken salad with dried blueberries and walnuts, white cheddar, and greens on a baguette.  Seriously, in my top ten of best sandwiches EVER.  However, even though the place has expanded, which is nice to not feel claustrophobic while eating, the service has slowed down quite a bit.  Sure, the people at the counter are super nice, but it shouldn't take 15 minutes to get a coffee drink, smoothie, and sandwich made and brought to your table.

Still, I recommend that you give Crema a try.  The food is excellent and hopefully if it continues to get a lot of business the owners can afford to get some full-time wait staff or more folks in the kitchen to get the food out faster to eager customers."}
{"text":"Finally made it over to Monona for brunch on Saturday. 

Our group of 6 arrived at 12:30 and thankfully there was a table available for us. You go and order up front with their very friendly staff. The ambiance is nothing special at all, but the view of the lake is really nice if you can grab a seat near the window. 

Overall, the food was very good. 
- Fungus Scrambler: AMAZING, I typically don't order scramblers because that's the easiest thing to make at home, but I would break my rule for this. If you like mushrooms but aren't huge on them, you will still adore this dish. Also there's truffle oil in this so...yeah. Do it.
- Killer Scramble: I'm a sucker for smoked salmon and eggs, and this dish is no exception. They're pretty generous with the salmon and it goes so well with the cheese, it's just a party in your mouth.
- Sweet Berry French Toast: meh. The server said this was really good but I disagree. Really boring, the orange mascarpone doesn't taste like orange or mascarpone and there's barely any on it anyway. Didn't love the texture of the toast, either.
- Gloomy Day (or something) Smoothie: delicious!!! I slurped this up in like 30 seconds.


I definitely want to go back, but I'll probably have anxiety over choosing between something I loved from my previous visit or trying something new!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but we waited for half an hour for our food to come. Not good when you're starving."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I drove over here for brunch yesterday morning (I live in downtown Madison) and we will absolutely be back! I ordered one of the specials: chili chicken tacos. It came with two tacos (chicken, pineapple salsa, avocado, cilantro, etc), scrambled eggs, and a small salad. Literally the perfect portion size, and so, so good. My boyfriend ordered one of the scramblers, and was a huge fan. The food was hot and you could just tell that everything was super fresh. We also tried the blueberry hill and apple & banana smoothies. Both were tasty, but the blueberry hill is very sweet. Almost like a blueberry dessert bar in smoothie form. It was fairly busy (around 11 am on a Sunday), but most people were in and out fairly quickly, and we were able to snag a table without much trouble. Overall, the staff was friendly and the food was awesome! We will be back."}
{"text":"Delicious, local food. My husband and I went on a Sunday morning. For brunch, expect a crowd (especially from 11am and on) so be patient or get there early. You order at the counter and then you'll need to wait for a table to open up if it's crowded - but the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The ambience and decor is great but food is average.."}
{"text":"My first visit wasn't the greatest because of the service (but then again, they had just opened at 7AM on a Saturday, and I'm sure I wouldn't be very bright eyed and bushy tailed that early either), but I came back again because the food was EXCELLENT. On my second visit, I had an extremely friendly woman take my order and my sour attitude about their customer service went right out the window.

I dream about the sweet potato hash. And the blue bird sandwhich. Seriously. These are two menu items you MUST try!

This cafe is not something you would expect inside of a tiny strip mall across from the lake. The food is unique and the atmosphere is cozy. It can easily be missed if you're passing through, so look out for it next time you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Seriously, they just must not like serving me here. I gave it another chance and again they forgot to put in our order and blew us off when we asked where our food was after 1/2 an hour. I will it be going back."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend.  Nice location near the lake loop bike trail.  Steel Cut oatmeal was very good."}
{"text":"Typically I wouldn't give a five star review after one experience but this place was beaming with goodness. I cannot wait to go back.

This is the perfect place to catch up with a friend over well thought out food. I skimmed the menu and went with the Ham & Jam. (A ham sandwich with tomato jam, goat cheese & red onion.) It was heaven sent goodness. And here's a secret: I'm not fan of ham. So that says a lot.

They serve Alterra coffee; refills are available and are 50 cents. (You order up front as well and the items are brought to you.) My friend had the Farmer's Scramble and we both decided I hit the jackpot. I cannot wait to head back and try the Fungus Scramble or any of the specials that seemed to get by me this morning. (I'll blame it on the daylight savings time.)

If you're thinking of going here and are with a small group, search no further. If you have a larger group, be careful with your timing as it might be tough to get a big table. I arrived at 9:30 on a Sunday Morning and there were only 2 open tables, both seating 2 or 3."}
{"text":"I recently grabbed a Sunday brunch at the Crema Cafe and was impressed by my first meal there.  I ordered the Killer Scramble (smoked salmon, leeks, goat cheese, three eggs) with a side of the sweet potato hash.

Things I liked:
* Holy mammoth portion size, Batman.  My plate was literally brimming over with food when the server delivered my meal to the table.  (Since I biked in from Waunakee, I appreciated generous serving size).  The cook did not scrimp on the salmon when preparing this this dish, which I appreciated on every forkful.
* Crema Café proudly serves Alterra coffee, always fresh, always delish.  Refills will set you back 50 cents.
* Even though they are nestled in a rather non-descript strip mall, I really enjoyed the indie coffeehouse vibe of the restaurant.  Cozy and welcoming with no hint of pretentiousness.  Bonus points for the great view of Lake Monona.
* The sweet potato hash was extremely fresh and flavorful - it really highlighted the natural sweetness of the sweet potato.  I would have liked to have more caramelization on the sweet potatoes, but I thoroughly enjoyed them as evidenced by my empty plate at the end of the meal.
* As mentioned by other reviewers, bonus points for their use of local ingredients and products from small farmers and producers.

Things I didn't:
* I didn't pick up much flavor of the leeks and chevre in the scramble.  While I appreciated the heavy dose of salmon, the dish would have benefited from better balance between the fillings.
* The floor was really dirty during my visit.  When I picked up my bike helmet, I noticed a fair amount of bread crumbs and other food remnants.  Granted, this was at the end of the morning rush, so it's understandable that things will not be pristine.  And the table and chairs were all thoroughly wiped down.

Based on this visit, I definitely plan on returning to explore more of their menu."}
{"text":"For the past few weeks, I have been told how good this place is. I have been told on a number of occasions that I have to try this place. So, the day after Thanksgiving, I find myself on Monona Drive and I think, why not - time to try it.

I was not impressed. Coffee was from Alterra (?), so what. Just average coffee. I ordered the petit dejeuner. It was just scrambled eggs. I don't eat bacon, and the toast was hard toast. Any easy coast diner can serve this and its 100 times better. It was priced okay at 5.50, but there was nothing that would make me come back. I bought a donut muffin on my way out and it was as equally disappointing.

There was nothing memorable here. I think of La Conversation in Los Angeles, where you order the pumpkin pancakes and you think of nothing else after you leave. The haunting memory drives you to return. Alas, that is not the case here.

Crema Cafe, I have had better."}
{"text":"All of my experiences here have been very pleasant. Pancakes, sandwiches, scrambles...and you can't beat the view."}
{"text":"Wow, simply wow. My lady and I love this place!!

Just had the breakfast sandwich, the ingredients in it were a great combo. 

My lady had the fungus scramble which was amazing and the blueberry hill smoothie. 

I will be back for a quick smoothie if I'm in the area and need a quick drink. The mocha was awesome too so if you need a quick pick me up stop into this place.

I just wish they had more seating :)"}
{"text":"One and done for me.  The owners have forgotten that very good food can be easily ruined by bad service, as was the case here.  I wanted to love this place because I have gotten good coffee here many times, but it failed as a restaurant.  The food was definitely good with some nice flavors, but when it took 33 minutes to get a simple breakfast, it was just unacceptable food service. It makes sense that they don't offer an bottomless cup of coffee, guests would drink the place out of business waiting for their food.  Oh, and toast was one piece of bread, cut in half ... really?"}
{"text":"So happy to find this Jem in Monona, where we are seriously lacking good restaurants! The staff, plates, decor are all adorable making it a very warm and inviting cafe. I chose the mushroom scrambler which was delicious! Definitely can taste that truffle oil. Good price too at $8.00. The only thing I didn't like was that it came with a petit salad, which would be ok but it was so plain, literally just lettuce. It needs a hint of dressing at least! 
Can't wait to return and try something else!"}
{"text":"One of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant in years.  Numerous issues, but the worst of which was that I was delivered the wrong items, and then told that the only was to have what I ordered was to go get back in line and order, and pay for, another meal.  What?!?  The staff there seemed to not care at all if anyone was happy or satisfied with their experience.  It was just a cattle call.  I will never go back."}
{"text":"The awesome atmosphere is trumped only by the yumminess of the sandwiches. I also like that they serve mostly local food. Great place."}
{"text":"Fresh, local, and good! You really have to experience it firsthand. Inexpensive breakfast options for the little ones, and I've never had an item I didn't like. Try the cherry galette. Wait. Don't. They're mine, all mine..."}
{"text":"A bike, some brunch and good times with 10 yelpers served as a reminder that I haven't written a review for Crema. FOR SHAME! 

Here's all you need to know:

-The cakes are solid! This weekend it was blueberry oatmeal and I could have eaten 3 orders. Hearty. Tasty. Good. 

-Their coffee is from Alterra... er, uhm Collectivo. No complaints from me!

-They have savory options and things that lean more lunch-like, but I have to say breakfast is where they excel, especially their scramblers. 

-It can take a little time to score a table on the weekend. Know that going in. Harder if you're in a large group."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with the breakfast offerings at Crema.

I got the Farmers Scramble. It was scrambled egg mixed with spinach, cheddar from a local diary and sausage from a local farm. I was so impressed. It came out with a spring salad tossed in a light vinaigrette dressing and 2 slices of fresh sour dough.

I also got a Mocha. I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I can tell you that it was one of the best tasting mocha's I have ever had. Whatever chocolate they used fit so well together with the coffee...yum.

My girlfriend got the Belgian Waffle. She said it was amazing. It looked great and was served with real Wisconsin maple syrup. My only concern was that if I had ordered it, the one waffle with no sides would not have been enough to fill me up. This was not a problem for her, so it was perfect.

The location is nice. It is in a strip mall, which is not ideal, but you overlook a beautiful view of the lake.

Overall: Delicious, just right portions, amazing Mocha, and a good view. What more could you ask for with breakfast!"}
{"text":"They have a unique selection of foods. It's mostly a salad, soup and sandwich place. 

My hot chocolate was made with fresh cream and was terrific. 

My sandwich was good, though I had goat cheese. I found I'm not really a fan of goat cheese. Who would have thunk it? Lol. 

It was still good considering, and their chips must be home made. I liked them though. My friend devoured her turkey sandwich. 

Great spot for talking and eating with a friend or two. If I ever end up back in Madison I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place in the Madison area! Manona is a bit of drive so I don't get there as often as I would like but the freindly, helpful employees and the consistent quality of both their food and coffee make it worth the trek. I recommend the smoked gouda grits, they're pretty great!"}
{"text":"Cute spot with tasty coffee from a popular Midwestern roaster the name of which I can't remember at the moment. Good pastries. The donut muffin is aptly named. A friend liked the blueberry muffin. A bunch of seating, but it seems to get pretty packed mid to late morning on the weekend. Shares parking with a bunch of other places in a little strip mall, and we had to wait briefly."}
{"text":"I took my mom to Crema Cafe the last time she was in town after a co-worker recommended it to me. Oh man. I am so glad she did!!!

We got there around 8:30 on a Saturday morning and were able to order quickly & get a table. A line did form at the ordering counter soon after we arrived, but it seemed like the tables turned over quickly enough to accommodate just about everyone!

Both of our meals were amazing. I had the power grits (cheesy grits with bacon & an egg on top) and I seriously dream about that meal now. The grits were so cheesy & indulgent. My mom got the fungus scramble and we both really liked that too.

Go Crema Cafe!

My only complaint: a lot of the tables were near the door and it's winter, so we were pretty freezing during most of our meal. It wasn't the biggest deal, but it did impact our comfort while we ate. Then again, it's winter in Wisconsin, so I'm not sure what else I would expect."}
{"text":"We love Crema Cafe! Delicious sandwiches and coffee drinks, pleasant casual atmosphere, and friendly staff.  Our favorites include the Breakfast Sandwich, Bluebird, and Gobbler. And the Ham So Gouda. Oh and the Balsamic Beef. Okay so maybe pretty much everything we've tried is a favorite! 
The only downside for us is that they don't have a baby changing station in the restroom (and the restrooms are filthy), which is strange considering that on weekdays the place is full of moms with babies (but don't get the wrong idea, it's not a loud crazy place overrun with screaming kids, any kids I've ever seen there have been very well-behaved). Today we had to go out and change our daughter in the back of the car because there wasn't anywhere inside to do it. That's fine when the weather is nice, but not really an option when it's raining or cold outside."}
{"text":"The Roman II is to die for! As a vegetarian, it's not very often I get excited about a sandwich. Enter Crema. The Roman II has roasted zucchini, tomatoes, provolone, red onion, a delicious balsamic vinaigrette and some arugula to top it all off. (This is from memory. Allow me a few errors!) Each sandwich comes with homemade tortilla chips. The chips are seasoned with some sort of goodness. Both the sandwich and chips make for a perfect lunch. 

Beside sandwiches, Crema has bakery items, a wide range of coffee drinks, and rotating soups. I hear they have brunch but haven't had a chance to check it out. 

The staff is really friendly and they always have a smile on their face. It's the perfect little eatery. Be warned, around lunch time this place gets quite busy. If you want to grab lunch on your short lunch break, go ahead and preorder."}
{"text":"Their regular menu is great, but their specials are just that - special. I would say that 90% of the time I eat one I say something along the lines of \"this is one of the best things I have ever eaten\", and I truly mean it. 
The only thing holding them back from being 5 stars for me is that I don't enjoy the coffee selection they have out regularly (an important thing for me) and I wish they were open later. 
I keep wanting to eat brunch at different places around Madison, but I am continually drawn back to Crema. Also, it gets really busy, so plan ahead!"}
{"text":"cute place, very nice people.. i too LOVED the bluebird sammich...and, i almost NEVER order  chicken salad( or tuna) out in a restaurant. You MUST try this sammich!"}
{"text":"A solid choice if quality is a main consideration. I've enjoyed everything I've tried. 

My only gripes are sometimes I could have the bread just a tad less toasted- It makes the sandwiches a little harder to eat than they need to be- and sure, if you're REALLY hungry, you might need to supplement your meal with a pastry to really fill up, because the portions aren't large. But I can count on this place to use fresh, thoughtful and high quality ingredients and that's what matters most to me!"}
{"text":"Been to Crema many times and keep wanting to like it there but the word \"underwhelming\" keeps popping up as it did for several other reviewers here. I have finally given up and hardly ever go there any more.
The food should be great since they use a lot of fresh, local ingredients but it always comes out Meh. The physical setup leaves a lot to be desired with the water and condiments against the wall which is also where people stand in line to get served which is also the path to the bathroom! Always a traffic jam there. 

The place gets very loud when it's busy and the service is awful. The help acts like they're doing you a favor by serving you. Based on the pathetic responses posted here by the Manager I now totally understand why the help's attitude is what it is. Note that he never takes responsibility for a customer's bad experience, like it's never his staff that might be the problem. Hmm ..."}
{"text":"I loved this cozy independently-run cafe and the ambience. The food was excellent, and the ingredients were very fresh. The menu options were appealing, and I appreciated the variety of vegetarian selections."}
{"text":"Adorable little joint on a rainy Sunday morning. Loved their coffee and fun options for drinks. The plates weren't very large as far as breakfast goes - I could have eaten more. Overall though it's pretty quick and yummy and well priced"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was great! Right when you walk in, you get that quaint breakfast cafe feel. The decor is perfect and welcoming. 

I got the sausage and peppers breakfast special. The sausage had great flavors and the peppers were roasted perfectly. Mix that together with the eggs, and it was a great breakfast. It also came with focchia bread to help soak up all the juices. It was surprising light and fluffy. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the side of mixed greens. It didn't seem to be dressed at all and was a little dry. Other than that, the meal was great!"}
{"text":"Great location to sit outside with the perfect latte with the lake and the capital view on your horizon , love their sandwiches nothing ordinary always creative"}
{"text":"I don't like the service style-stand in line, order, pay, sit down, get up to get your own coffee, sit down and your food is brought to you. It's just obnoxious. 
But the food and the coffees are very good. Quality ingredients, put together in an interesting combination. Very solid. We're weekend semi regulars and I could love the place if it weren't for the above."}
{"text":"I ordered the Lake Edge eggs and hash,  and I wasn't too impressed. It was supposed to come with 2 eggs, and what I got was not 2 eggs. The potatoes were a mix of regular and sweet potatoes--they were bland and dry. The sausage was the kicker for me. There was so much fennel seed in it, I couldn't taste anything else. I was drowning in a sea of fennel seeds. 

I was super unhappy when I left, and I went home and had second breakfast. I don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love The Gobbler! I get this sandwich every time I'm there. I always upgrade to the greens instead of the chips bc they're lightly dressed and very fresh greens! The portions are perfect for the price. They do not skimp out. The Gobbler is piled high with turkey, cranberry relish, goat cheese, arugula and a touch of mayo. It's on a delicious wheat bread. Yum! I don't live close but it's worth the drive over!"}
{"text":"It's quite a drive from downtown so I struggle to make it over this way often, but finally made it happen because Crema. 

After ordering up at the counter, we settled into our table and feasted on the cinnamon crumb coffee cake we snagged and mmm was that sugary goodness. We had planned on just tasting it then taking the rest home, but yeaa that did not happen. We finished off that piece of cake pretty quickly. 

With such a tasty start to the meal, we waited eagerly for the rest of the food. 
-scrambled eggs with sweet potato hash and whole wheat toast
-an egg white fungus scramble with whole wheat toast and greens
-a scramble of the day with whole wheat toast and greens
-one blueberry almond pancake

The toast was griddled up in butter, the greens were dressed, and the pancake was studded with blueberries. This was quality breakfast food. 

Throughout our meal, I was eyeing a little girl slurping on a very vibrantly purple and delicious looking smoothie, so I will be checking those out in my next trip. I've also seen pictures of the crema oatmeal and know I need that in my life soon. To be continued."}
{"text":"Crema is definitely in my top brunch spots in Madison. Just a little place in a strip mall, but has so much going for it. From great coffee and smoothies to awesome changing brunch specials and amazing pastries, this place is easy to love. I definitely recommend trying out a smoothie and a pastry if you're there - especially their savory pastries. Their scrambled are also very good, my go to is the fungus scramble. I love trying out their new specials. It can be busy on weekends, but usually I can always find a table if I wait just a little bit."}
{"text":"stated out with  Chai tea, which was served at the perfect temperature, ready to drink right away! I ordered the Tuna Sandwich, which was very good, and served with an abundance of mixed greens. The flavor was very interesting. It had a tangy, sourness that was unique and I quite enjoyed. I do wish it was served on a bigger plate, but really of little consequence.

The decorum is awesome, I love the retro feel and style. Being a graphic designer the design in a cafe just adds to the  experience for me. Great color scheme.

The staff was very courteous and knew some regulars by name, and greeted them as they entered the door. The service was fast and I didn't wait too long for my food. They told everyone leaving to have a good day. Although it may give off the young hip vibe, this place isn't just for modern day hipsters. As I was leaving a very elderly group of people came in to eat. Overall a great experience!

I do think the price should be more reflective of this though $$"}
{"text":"Good service. Good ambience. Friendly staff.
Food... Meh... I have been to better breakfast places in Madison that have many more options on the menu.
The price on the items for the quantity of food is high in my opinion. I haven't had the \"yummmm\" feeling you get when you have really good breakfast here yet.
Might give it another try."}
{"text":"Don't think I will ever return on a weekend afternoon. Always way to busy, which I guess is a good thing for business, but I waited 30 minutes for 2 \"to go\" sandwiches (wanted to eat there, but never seems to be a table). Even the man who ordered after us got his food first somehow. It just seems that the service is a little confused (lots of very young workers). Sandwiches were pretty good, & the mango smoothy was good too, but it's tough to deal with the wait & unorganized service."}
{"text":"Fantastic smoothies, I actually crave them! The breakfast menu is always charming and delicious!"}
{"text":"went here for brunch a couple times... haven't tried any of their drinks yet but the food was great!

got what i think was the bluebird sandwich which was really good, but kinda sweet and another sandwich that was warmed up made of chicken...sorry can't remember the name but that was really good too.

the staff is really nice and helpful... definitely a place to go to hang out with friends to talk and have something good to eat!"}
{"text":"Delightful breakfast and lunch place across the street from a beautiful park and Lake Monona.  3 tables in front of this strip-mall restaurant, with quaint old formica kitchen tables and fiesta ware place settings inside.  Food is local and delicious. Delicious sandwiches and an awesomely flavorful range of egg dishes.  A mellow, family friendly place."}
{"text":"Yes. Just yes to everything about this adorable little cafe. 

High quality, locally sourced, ethical ingredients. Fair trade coffee. DELICIOUS everything I have ever tried. Brioche french toast is my favorite. 

Get's a little packed inside during the weekends for brunch, expected! But I have never had to wait for a table. Always seems to work out just fine. 

Food takes a little longer to come out that I would have expected, but it is SO worth the wait, and honestly I would rather wait a little longer knowing it's all being prepared fresh instead of it just being warmed up. 

I am a huge fan. Been here several times and I am certain I will be here several more in the future."}
{"text":"A small, cozy, bustling cafe near Madison's botanical gardens. A great place to hang and take advantage of the free wi-fi if you don't mind the noise of people coming and going. The staff always seems to know exactly what they're doing, though in my experiences haven't gone out of their way to be friendly. Good smoothies--I tried both the Gloomy Day and Peach Punch. I loved the Gloomy Day. It was thick and fruity and not overly sweet. It really brightened up my gloomy day! I also tried the ArtiMelt sandwich and loved it's flavor. Have yet to try anything off of Crema's tempting breakfast menu. I love that they use local eggs in their dishes!"}
{"text":"Crema is great! This is our favorite neighborhood place for breakfast. The ingredients are fresh and high quality. It costs a little bit more than your typical greasy spoon, but the taste and quality make up for it."}
