{"text":"A small sushi restaurant with a very diverse menu. All you can eat dinner for two adults and two kids was delicious. The creme brûlée was perfect and the price was very reasonable. 
I would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Prices are the same as other all you can eat Japanese sushi restaurants. Been here several times in the last year and each time the sushi has been consistent...freshish, totally edible. Lots of cooked food selection and the steamed egg is yummy. One of my very favourite menu items. I try to go when it's not very busy, just before lunch or dinner rush or after to get better service. Wait times for food are reasonable. Service is matter of fact, not too much bantering or suggestions on what's good, but it's ok with our party as we just want to eat at all you can eat places...decent enough food. All you can drink canned pop which is a treat at all you can eat places."}
{"text":"I just don't understand how this restaurant survives with their low quality sushi and barely there service. The sushi is of the lowest quality I've ever seen....I can get better sushi at a food coart than this place. They play Hobg Kong pop music and a waiter leaned against the wall in front of me playing on her iPhone. Honestly I can't recommend this restaurant to anyone who genuinely enjoys Japanese cuisine. First and last time here for me."}
{"text":"I have had this place twice and it really varies on the day you go. I had dinner and they ran out of the steamed egg which is disappointing because thats my favourite thing on the menu at any sushi place. Their fish wasn't fresh this time, the Saba I had received was darkened and slimy, though the Salmon was all good they cut the slices super thick and it was fresh and not shiny like my saba was. The handrolls, maki, or any type of roll for that matter does consist of far to much rice to meat/fish ratio. So if you like alot of rice heres your place but if your a meat lover/ fish lover this place isn't worth the time. 

Like: Beef short ribs, salmon sashimi

Dislike: Service, temperament of waiter, and quanitities of food they serve."}
{"text":"Not a fan. I go to a lot of AYCE Japanese restaurants (not that I'm proud of it) and this is one I would NOT revisit. In general this place looked a little old (their menus were pretty disgusting - obviously worn and sticky), and their food - cold and warm dishes - were not that good. To me, a lot of it lacked flavour. And another thing that actually irked me the most is how much rice they put in their sushi and hand rolls! It's like 60-70% rice! That particular aspect bothers me the most because it's just cheap when AYCE places put LOTS of rice so that it fills you up. 

For the price (18.99 on weekdays, 20.99 weekends), I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Been going there for over 8 years. Service and food very consistant and good.
We've been to some places that have good days and bad days but not here.
Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Don't know what all the hype was for this place, it's simply not that good. I'll list what i had and what i thought about them

Sashimi: the only pretty damn good thing on their menu
Shrimp tempura: same as other places
Unagi handroll: lacked flavour
Beef short ribs: oily, oily, OILY! And overcooked (this was so gross I had difficulty swallowing it and I still feel like throwing up.)
Green salad: ughh lost appetite when i saw it (hell I could do better at home)
Miso soup: i've had better
Seaweed salad: pretty standard
Scallop sushi: this was pretty good
Unagi pizza: meh...
Chicken cutlet udon and seafood udon: chicken was nothing special. Seafood was overcooked to blandness. Broth was below average.
Steamed egg: Yang's kitchen did this better by far!
Fried ice cream: wait....it was fried? All it was was a lump of ice cream covered by some fried bits of stuff. I guess the words \"fried\" and \"ice cream\" are actually separate...
Saba sushi: was okay
Overall service: Very difficult to get the attention of the wait staff at times....

Was probably the most disappointing experience I've ever had at a Japanese AYCE. Those of you considering this place, I would strongly recommend going somewhere else. 

The only reason I even gave this place a 2 is because their Sashimi was good."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Food was sub-par, customer service was terrible. Asked for the bill and it came 15 mins later .. Meanwhile we could see one of the servers was on her phone. Food wasn't worth the price at all."}
{"text":"you know a sushi buffet is bad when the best thing is their jello or udon. the price is raised and on the outside it still gives the old place. the amount of rice on the sushi rolls is massive while the cooked food tastes bad. the tofu was sour. 

I used to come a lot but guess I don't have to anymore. well, they DO have free canned coke so that's good.... I guess and can get wifi from neighboring stores.... that's all that's good."}
{"text":"Not the best all you can eat sushi I've had, and not the worst!
There's quite a selection (vegetarian and non-vegetarian) and the food is good! Definitely not bland like some other all you can eat sushi places I've been to, but I also can't say it compares to some of the better ones. The first time I went I ordered some weird vegetarian \"specialty roll\" which I couldn't finish because there was ginger and some other things inside it which I could not stand (but I will blame this on poor ordering choice), however the second time I went I ordered the right things and was much more satisfied. I seriously have no idea where to eat AYCE sushi in the more south-eastern parts of Markham, but compared to the other place I've been to somewhat near here (Mikado Sushi Robata), Sushi on 7 is amazing. 

I found the service to be alright and I don't have any complaints when it comes to that. My whole group printed off 10% coupons from RedFlagDeals and they were all honoured. The atmosphere is not the best as the place is always busy and quite small, but this isn't very different from most all you can eat sushi restaurants.

I'm really torn between 3 and 4 stars for this restaurant, but I think it may be a bit too mediocre for a 4-star. Overall, I would recommend this place if it's close by and you're craving sushi... but it's not really worth going out of your way for!"}
{"text":"Lots of food & fast service but very pricey, occasion only for all you can eat experience."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places I've been to! Love the quality of the food. Faves: sashimi, seaweed salad, the teriyaki stuff, sake mussels soup and DEEP FRIED BANANAS with Greet Team ice cream! Best dessert ever! 

Not a lot of people know that there's orange juice you can get with the meal, it's quite good with all that sushi :)"}
{"text":"My ex boyfriend and i both got sick after we ate there about two years ago.  Although we did just come back from Wonderland we felt fine before eating so it must have been the food.  He got food poisoning and i felt queezy for a few hours.  Hopefully others had a more positive experience than we did.  Aside from that, the food tasted pretty good otherwise and we went late enough that we did not have to wait to be seated."}
{"text":"It is a small place, a bit hard to find for the first time. Food is very decent for the price, esp the sashimi during dinner time, very fresh. You can find all the standard items you have at other Japanese AYCE. They have the squid skewer, which I think is pretty good; Curry beef on rice (i rarely go for rice when going to AYCE, but this is the only exception) is pretty good; however, I find it not as strong as it used to be. Sometime the grill/BBQ items can take a bit longer to prepare, but we have never missed any orders. 

Service is not bad, I mean just have to make eye contacts and the staff will assist with the order or any request. I find it can be quite busy during the weekend, and it is pretty much full even during lunch time. If you really want a brunch on the weekend, I would suggest arrive a bit early (it opens at 11:30). Great thing about its lunch is $13.99 through out the week. If you wanna use the 10% off coupon offered on CCUE, they only take cash payment. All in all it is a great place :)"}
{"text":"Food is decent for its price, but the service is inconsistent. Sometimes my orders come in quick succession, but other times they come 1 by 1 separated by minutes. The menu is nice and tidy but filled with typos. The place is relatively clean, which is more than I can ask for in a Japanese ayce."}
{"text":"Good selection.  It's a small place so larger groups may have trouble getting in without a reservation, so call ahead of time."}
{"text":"people hate on AYCE sushi, but if I'm going to rate this place in comparison to other AYCE places this is easily one of my favourites.

It's a small space so it can get kind of busy, but it has been around for a long time. The variety of sushi/cooked food, etc is the same as any other AYCE place, but the quality is more consistent and better than other places I have been."}
{"text":"Came here with a close friend of mine, both of us were craving some belly stuffing and stuffed we were.

We came here for the dinner menu in hopes that there would be an offering of red tuna. We were not disappointed in the selection, but the quantity of the red tuna was disappointing. I found that they made huge rolls that promoted less exploring of dishes and rapid filling of the stomach. The rolls themselves were good, a better quality than most of the AYCE joints I've been to, but they were much to large. Imagine trying to eat a maki roll the size of a temaki. Speaking of temaki, the tuna one is definitely not worth it as it was 75% rice and 25% red tuna pretty much a stomach space waster. I have been told by my girlfriend to keep in mind that it could have been because the proprietors were running low for the day...

Although I found their red tuna lacking I must say that I would return for their AYCE though I would be more judicious with my orders are pretty much target their sashimi(very generous cuts too!) and avoid their rolls.

Dinner on a weekend for two including tax and the tip(added on for a two person table, that was a first for me) came out to $50+."}
{"text":"Used to love this place.  Been there for many times especially during the time when my wife and I were dating.

But with so many more AYCE buffets popping up, Sushi on 7 seems to be still doing everything the same, same food, same decor, etc.

Food is not bad.  Cooked food is quite good too.  Although my wife in the past have said getting a stomach ache after going there.

All in all, it's a so-so AYCE buffet for me now."}
{"text":"There are two AYCE sushi places that my sister, brother and I always go for and this is one of them. I think the waitstaff should be required to know our name by now considering the fact that there was a time this year when we practically visited this place like once a week. It is that good. Although sometimes I feel like they jip you by not giving you all the orders you've ordered because they think that you are too much of a pig, I still love this place.

Spider rolls? For an AYCE sushi restaurant, I think this one has the best. It's not comparable to ones that you can get from my favourite a la carte Sushi place like Ichiban Fish House or like Sushi on Bloor - but it's fairly decent!

Oh and my favourite dessert, COCONUT JELLO. lol. I can never get sick of this place! Although I wish they expand their space, wait time could be a long time especially during weekends and if you're stupid enough not to make a reservation."}
{"text":"I know you can't really expect A1 sushi quality in an AYCE Japanese spot but Sushi on 7 is probably one of the best AYCEs I've tried in the GTA (Tanpopo in Vancouver is better IMO) quality wise. As usual I try to get a jump on everyone else by having lunch by 11:30 so bad service is never really an issue. The sushi was well prepared both in taste and construction. I can't seem to recall but something was missing from their AYCE which is either the tempura, soda, or ice cream. Whatever it was this place is still highly recommended for the sushi gluttons out there."}
{"text":"Had lunch at this place, and I think it is truly A-OK. I really enjoyed the variety of the menu, however I never got to try certain things since they are reserved for the dinner menu. Overall the quality of the ingredients used are not as high as Tenichi (in my opinion, but then again sushi on 7 is also cheaper), but the food doesn't taste bad either. The food also comes in very generous portions, and you are guaranteed to leave full! However there's not much special about the service in this restaurant, the waitresses just take your order, bring your food, get you your bill. No more, no less, as expected from a restaurant run by Chinese people (no racism intended, I am chinese).Dessert wise I excited to try the fried ice cream [yes its actually possible to FRY ice cream, I saw it on food network] but I was slightly disappointed since it turned out to have only been ice cream rolled in crushed granola or something like that.

As a summary, the price matches the quality of the food, you get what you paid for in terms of product and service. Nice variety in the maki selection which doesn't happen that much in a lot of sushi joints. Enjoyable to go to, but if I've got extra money I would still prefer Tenichi."}
{"text":"This is where me and my family usually go as Sushi Island is located downtown and parking is minimal. The resto is a typical Japanese AYCE you got your Spider, Cali, Dragon, Rainbow rolls, and different types of Sashimi. 

This place stands out to us because the quality of food is always consistent and service is also on top of everything. However it is a small resto and no questions ask YOU HAVE TO MAKE RESERVATIONS.


Food - 4/5
Recommendations- Spider Rolls, Yakitori, Nachos, Green Dragon Roll, Black Dragon Roll, Grilled Steak"}
{"text":"As my friend Brett said halfway through dinner: This isn't all you care to eat. It's all you CAN eat. Ignore your brain, ignore your stomach, it's all about satisfying your tastebuds.

This is our second time visiting this place and once again, it was a 20 minute wait, but well worth it. The quality of the food here is incredible. On the rating scale you give an AYCE place, this place is a 15/10. The rice is  just right, and not overgenerous, the tempura is always crispy and the sashimi is fresh. The rolls are all incredible. I really can't describe how great this place is. The choices are dizzying, so we ordered in rounds: everyone picks 2 dishes per round, so you're not thinking about what everyone else wants and one person isn't trying to remember a billion choices.

The couple of things that stuck out for me as super delicious: Spicy scallop roll and the crystal roll (instead of rice, it's a rice wrap, like a Vietnamese salad roll). 

Seriously, more things than not are amazing, so ladies, pack your eatin' dress, guys... do whatever it is you do when you are going to eat a shit load of delicious food."}
{"text":"To get the bad things out in the open first, the maki rolls here are terrible - they exemplify exactly what you would expect from cheap japanese ayces. They give you a load of rice to fill you up with and very little of the ingredients you actually ordered. Likewise with the sushi, this restaurant puts way too much rice into it as a tactic to discourage you from eating more.

Now onto why I'm still giving this place 4 stars is because once knowing not to order the maki/sushi if not desperate, everything else was great. The sashimi here is cut into very thick slices, their menu has a nice variety to choose from, and the grilled foods were quite good as well (salmon belly in particular). BEST OF ALL, I was delighted to find out that they offered all you can eat scallop sashimi for dinner!! I've been searching quite vigorously to find a place that offered it and I was stoked when I saw it on their menu. Just know that one scallop is sliced very thinly into several \"pieces\" so don't be afraid to order 20-30 pieces just for yourself! :)"}
{"text":"???????????????????to start things off, i would like to mention that they are no longer called sushi on 7. They rebranded to \"sushi 8\" .. most likely changed owners. 

I went at noon on a weekday.. empty.. and when seated, the tables were sticky and dirty. The lunch ayce is $2 more than the avg at $15.99 which is rediculous for the garbage they give you to eat. 

The food is bad.. spicy salmon was sweet and had a sour-ish flavour. Probably a week or more old and is turning bad cuz literally no one goes there.. 

The cali rolls are bleh and all their rolls are loaded with a thick layer of rice to literally try to stuff u cuz they have little of whatever in the middle.. their salmon sashimi is like so thin its ripped in the middle lmao. Pics to prove. 

I ordered a combo set lunch which should have come with ice cream, but when we finished eating, not only did we not ask for the bill yet, they gave it to us anyways and there was no icecream. Like what the actual fuck. . . 

Basically, dont ever come here ever again.. 
And on a side note to real japanese people, this is a Chinese owned restaurant so the fish is not fresh and you probably wouldnt wanna try cuz it aint authentic."}
{"text":"A no frills, no decor AYCE sushi experience.  Wait staff is meh, but that kind've goes with the look and feel of the place.  Sort've like a shack noodle shop.  When in Rome.

Thick ass slabs of sashimi always win my vote.  Good variety of textures and spice in their crispy roll.  Dragon roll was big, plump and generous with avocado.  Sadly all the other rolls I've eaten there are easily forgettable. 

Quality has declined in the last year or so, has become inconsistent.  If you go enough times, you'll get a great meal or a very disappointing one.  In the end it all averages out to just average."}
{"text":"For any AYCE sushi places, you will not find anything 3+ stars. Sushi on 7 is a very standard AYCE sushi places with your typical rolls (Crunchy spicy salmon, dynamite, red dragon, one colour roll, etc) has a good amount of variety even for lunch. They recently changed owners and is now called Sushi 8. Staff are still the same and the items from Sushi on 7 menu is also very similar if not the same. Always look online for Sushi on 7 coupon before hand, they always have a 10% off coupon floating around online if you pay with cash.

Must gets here: deep fried scallop, and their popcorn chicken is on par with tawinese snack shops such as Cha me Cha (which is just down the street) and papa Chang. Their sushi rolls are also quite good with 80% of portion being the fish and only about 20% of rice. Lots of hot items and a whole section of raman, udon, and fried udon and fried rice (but really who wastes their stomach on that?) Lunch has no sashimi, but dinner has alot more other rolls (like spider roll!) and sashimi (even has scallop sashimi)

Price did go up a bit though with the name change. Lunch from Monday - Sunday is 15.99"}
{"text":"I would give this a 1.5 star if I could, but since I'm feeling generous, 2 stars it is.

Been here twice. Food is below average. Not worth it for the price you pay. The salmon just doesn't taste very fresh. Service is mediocre. The staff are not the most polite that I have met before, they rush you a little bit and just seem very impatient. Food comes pretty quick usually. 
Love their coconut jello for dessert, but the second time I came here they ran out... Which is pretty irritating if you love coconut jello as much as I do.

It's a very small restaurant, with very little seating and can get crowded easily. Washrooms are gross. No special decor at all, design was very simple and it has a very cheap atmosphere if you ask me.

Would not return and would not recommend this considering there are far better AYCE places in the Markham/Richmond Hill area."}
{"text":"Considering there isnt  a whole lot of AYCE jap restaurants...this is one of the better ones...there was a pretty good selection, price is decent and service could be a little better. The only thing i really didnt like is how the place is soooo crowded, but aside from that...so far so good!"}
{"text":"I use to come here with my former partner (sounds less whiny than ex g/f lol) quite a bit.  We'd always order a bunch of rolls (dragon, spider - which is never available, crispy roll, eel roll and a bunch of tuna, salmon and mackerel sashimi), tempura and ice crea.

The rolls are acceptable though they have a bit too much rice, but the sashimi is doesn't taste quite right and are very small pieces.   If you are looking for a top notch sushi restaurant - avoid, if you're looking for an AYCE experience - not a bad choice, but you can certainly do better."}
{"text":"I cannot believe I never reviewed Sushi on 7 when this is my absolute go to AYCE sushi place. Maybe I enjoyed it very time that I just purely go to eat the food and not be distracted with taking photos.....before. That, and I didn't have a smartphone. 

So here goes. Yea, not the fanciest of places but I never cared for superficial shhhhstuff. If you must know those things, well Sushi7 has very cool looking wooden booths. They now have YouFan service intercom where you just press the order/bill/water/service buttons. 

Now food. The pictures will tell you that they are good for a great price. I love to do dinner buffet because I like sashimi more than sushi, so that I can eat more fish than rice. Even so, when you order sushi, they don't give you 2/3 rice and only 1/3 fish. Their sushi has bigger fish to rice ratio; just what I like. 

Their appetizer is amazing too. The chicken, beef, squid skewers, tempura shrimp, teriyaki, and fried mackerel:  to fond over about, really. 

Dessert: things that you can treat yourself to after that meal can include a can of pop, ice cream, fried banana, creme brûlée, and/or mango pudding. 

Oh yeah, the service is always good. Sometimes you have to wait for some of your orders, but I never mind waiting for good eats and good people bringing me food."}
{"text":"Went there a few times for gathering, food was OK, sashimi overall is not as fresh when compared to other AYCE, sometimes food is rushed, taste wise was OK too, fortunately they did change 1 policy I like, which is tempura shrimp no longer comes with all those fried veggies, which was a big turn off many years ago."}
{"text":"All you can eat sushi lunch was simply ok, but a tad expensive.

I am not sure I was so taken by this sushi that I will be back."}
{"text":"Worst ayce sushi place. Service is slow and rude.  Felt unwelcome and an inconvenience to ask for anything. Server leaned against the wall and played on her phone.  Food was not fresh. Salad had ice on it, wasabi and ginger dryed out.  Food i would give a 2 out of 10. Felt sick after eating there  the restaurant was dirty and the bathroom disgusting. Will not be going back there. Thought of it makes us feel sick."}
{"text":"Only been here once before and I remembered it being better than my current time here. Mostly due to the very poor service. I myself have been a server so I try to show some compassion but come on you need more than 2 servers on a Friday at lunch time...I waited 15 minutes for miso soup and the servers didn't communicate with each other so we ended up getting 4 bowls....then I waited for tea...and I felt like I was inconveniencing the servers every time I requested something even though That's their job. 

The food is good, nothing special to report that I would come back here for again...as long as the ingredients are fresh any sushi restaurant can produce good product but what's going to make me want to come back is the service. The atmosphere is quaint.  I understand charging a gratuity but you should at least provide the minimum of good service when doing so."}
{"text":"Writing this review after a visit on Friday lunch time. Food portioning and taste and quality was standard for the price but holy crap was service slow. They didnt communicate with each other and were understaffed for the busiest time ! Give them some help !"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant for years now and I have never had any issues with them. They have always been consistent in their food and their service. Recently coming here with friends due to a very bad waiting experience at another nearby sushi restaurant. We knew we could rely on Sushi on 7 to provide us with good service and good food. They may not have the fanciest of rolls/sushi however if you are looking for a solid place for AYCE that is able to deliver consistent results. Their sashimi is delicious and cut very well, no tiny slices of salmon here! They offer more options on the dinner menu vs. the lunch, which is usually how most menus are. They clear your empty plates away and make sure you have enough tea/water as well any requests are noted quickly. They have never rushed us out the door and have always let us take our time to enjoy our meals/our conversations. Even after all the years it's been, still has been one of my good go-to places."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that receives such good reviews and is so acclaimed by the online community, it's really small... and because of that, it's really hidden. It took us a few tries to find the place (FYI it's North West of Highway7/Kennedy), and when we got there, it was already half full (on a weeknight at 6:30 that's pretty impressive). 

When the waiter sat us down, we took a while to order and wrote down everything we wanted on the back of a receipt one of our friends had. The waiter came and already he seemed like he didn't want to be there. As we  listed out what we wanted, he put his hand out midway, rolled his eyes and softly but sternly said \"I cannot write that fast.\" Had he said it more politely I wouldn't have minded as much. Regardless, the food came after a while (slow compared to other places i.e. Maison du Japon). 
Although the popcorn chicken that we ordered came after a long while, it was steaming hot and very crispy. It was definitely a highlight.

- The vegetable tempura had no broccoli (?) and the tempura dough was insufficient. The shrimp tempura was decent though.

Unfortunately the experience ended on a low note with the dessert. We were terribly excited to try their deep fried ice cream and it was questionable when he asked us what flavour we wanted as it is usually prepackaged. When it came it was simply ice cream generously sprinkled with crispy oats. It wasn't bad but... it was disappointing. (For good AYCE Sushi fried ice cream go to Sushi Fun on Yonge and Clark)

The place is pretty good for 18.99, though watch out for the bill!! They automatically add gratuity, which they calculate by adding 10% AFTER tax (which I'm not sure is legal, since it's supposed to be BEFORE)..."}
{"text":"$13.99 weekday all you can eat (adult price). $12.99 for seniors. 10% when showing them the CCUE online coupon and paying with cash. So far, I'm liking this...a lot.

It's a small restaurant. About 60 seats. Nice and bright and clean. My grandmother is in a wheelchair, so when we let them know ahead of time, they made sure to move some chairs away so she would have space to sit. That was nice of them. What was also really nice of them was that we knew about the CCUE coupon, but had neglected to print it/put it on our phones, and they still gave us the discount (although we did get a reminder to bring it next time).

Their menu is fairly standard. Nothing particularly unique, but what they do is pretty solid. Everything we had was either standard quality and taste for AYCE, or above average.

 We only tried one roll: crispy dragon - think a California roll with tempura bits inside, then topped with eel and avocado). They could gone a little heavier on the eel and avocado, but it was fresh. What I greatly appreciate is that both times I've been in the restaurant, their avocado has been consistently fresh. 

Their salmon flower sushi (salmon rose) was fairly decent, but not consistent. The first order we got had about two pieces of salmon per rose (jaggedly cut sashimi slices of salmon), but the second round only had one piece of salmon per rose.

Highlights: 
chicken internal delicacies - on skewers. Small chicken hearts/kidneys?. Outside had crispy bbq-ed bits, and it had a nice chew.
grilled mackarel - mackarel fillet (small bones. be careful). Juicy flesh, crisp skin. Served with a lemon wedge. I ordered this three times.
Squid skewers - small cuttlefish on skewers served with some kind of bbq sauce. Tender.
Grilled beef roll with enoki mushroom - good stuff. beef wasn't tough. enoki mushrooms weren't super-stringy.

Service was fairly good for the most part, except that toward the end, one of the servers started to frown.

All in all, good stuff for what you pay. I'll be coming more often."}
{"text":"okay if my last review was about the food quality this review would be because i have a beef with the service.

So my problem with this store startedwhen I read on another yelper's review that we can get 10% off on lunch or dinner bill if paid by cash till jan 31, 2013. I went on the website that has the coupon and presented that to the server on my android before we asked for the bill. The waiter just basically told me no, it NEEDS to be printed. asked to speak to the manager, nope, still NEEDS to be printed. Guess saving paper is not an option, feels like i just time travelled back to the stone age, rigid rules much? When I pursued to ask a reason, i was told it NEEDS to be scanned into a computer... well actually I never got how that works since the coupon has no barcodes or... any codes. I mentioned if that's the rule they need to state that on the coupon itself, or if they don't want people using the coupon, just don't even make it available. Anyway, walked away pretty mad in the end. arguing any further on hubby's birthday evening was just not necessary, but it certainly made our night unpleasant. truthfully, when it's the matter of 3-4 bucks, letting the regular customers win so they always come back (and bring friends here) is certainly the way I would run my restaurant! Something is wrong with their business model... and I will not return for a long time. Someone take my Duchess title from here please. 

the menu actually is updated so there's more things to pick from, i like the wasabi baked mussels! food is still good. I give the chef thumbs up, management, not so much. 

Now i'm on the hunt for a better sushi spot."}
{"text":"They were great when i first started going there 8+ yrs ago. The sushi is good, terriyaki is mediocre. The service is horrible. Last time I was there 2 years ago, I saw a cockroach climbing the banquet....we've never been back."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, I like the fact that they offer free drinks but the service here is absolutely terrible. 

I came here with my boyfriend for dinner and 10 minutes in they took away our menu. How are we supposed to know what they offer? A few minutes after, a waitress came and asked me if I was going to finish my salad. I said that I am going to finish it and then she took our bowls of soy sauce and dumped it into my salad and took it away. Maybe it's a language issue but I said I would finish my salad, and even though she took it away, why would she take away our bowls for soy sauce??

I felt very rushed and uninvited. I didnt even get to eat until I was full. There were always eyes on us and only the younger male server was kind to us. I used to like this place and recommended it to all of my friends but I will not be returning.  

The lady servers with the short bob styled hair are VERY rude."}
{"text":"This USED to be my Sushi AYCE go to spot.  Maki Zushi in Stoufville has taken that spot for several years now.  I have been to Sushi on 7 many a times before that.

I'll get straight to the point with this review:

- Decent food - everything is acceptable.

- Small and crowded restaurant.

- Poor service (Where do I start?  \"scratches head\".  Sum it up with rude waitresses)   

You can live with decent food and it being a crowded small spot but the service is something to be desired."}

{"text":"CUTE! Chinese girl would give this place a 5 star, no doubt. Me. Not so much. Unlike other AYCE sushi places, there's no tick sheet. It's a little hard to mentally organize your plan of attack. I found the staff kind of unsmiling. There was one younger Mandarin speaking male who took a liking to CUTE! Chinese girl and he was quite attentive.

The fried ice cream and tempura bananas were outstanding. The dinner menu (we were here for lunch) seems to have some better options. CUTE! Chinese girl loved and packed way the kalbi. Usually she'll finish up an AYCE sushi dinner with 5 or 6 scoops of ice cream but it was \"magic time\" and cold foods/beverages make her cramp up worse. So she had to eschew her normal ice cream pig out.

Oh yeah, the seaweed salad is awesome. The popcorn chicken was nice enough.

I think I'd go back, for sure, probably for dinner.

Just watch the bill. A 10% service charge is added."}
{"text":"Honestly the best AYCE sushi spot in Markham/York Region.  The food was great and fresh tasting, unlike some it's local competitors, as well as a great and timid customer service; our server even said to me \"don't worry, I won't let you starve.\"   pricing is in line with quality, service and atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon for the lunch AYCE. 
Mon to Sun $14.99 for the lunch AYCE 
Mon to Thurs $21.99 / Fri to Sun and holidays $23.99 for the dinner AYCE. If you want to have the dinner menu during lunch, you can and this will get you more options on the menu like sashimi and better desserts. 

It was around 12:30pm when we arrived and there were no customers at all. So service was amazing and blazing fast. Later in the afternoon the place started to get more busy. 

The quality is definitely very average but for $15 you get what you pay for. The chicken and beef skewers were below average. The sushi was okay and half decent. The shrimp tempura were probably the best dishes. They were nice and crispy and tasted pretty good. As for dessert on the lunch menu the only one worth getting is the ice cream.

Parking is a nightmare as there are so many little shops around."}
{"text":"Perhaps the food tasted so delicious as we were all beyond starving when we arrived, however I believe the food itself was just very delicious.
Service was great - got tea right when we sat down, miso soup and seaweed salad was brought out within minutes of ordering. 
The rest of our food also came out in a timely manner, which we wolfed down. Food was brought out a bit more slowly at the end of our visit, as the restaurant was getting busier. Understandable.
Everything was fairly standard of an all you can eat sushi restaurant.
A few good exceptions:
a) salmon sashimi was MASSIVE! They were like 2 pieces in 1 order, it was fantastic
b) try the enoki beef rolls (I believe?) - they are so good. I've never seen that before, but boy oh boy they are a great creation
c) beef skewers were great
d) crème brûlée was pretty darned good too

Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Yea, for all you can easy sushi, this place is not bad. 
I ordered a couple of hand rolls: the fish were ok, the seaweed were ok but the rice was not ok. it still not bad compare to sushi tei, but still not pass to as good sushi.
I guess this place is trying to keep the food fresh vs buffet, where they prepared the food a head of time and this one is you order and they prepare it for you.
deep fried ice-cream is no more than ice-cream rolls on breadcrumb. (they shouldn't call it fried..)
good selection, just like buffet but its on the menu other than on the heating plate.
if you are hungry and just wants to eat tons of sashimi + other stuff and don't care about the taste, this place is not bad. if you are hungry and wants to eat good sushi, this ain't it."}
{"text":"I find this place more promising than other AYCE joints because the service is slightly better.  The food does not take tremendously long to come, and they did not forget items on purpose. 

The sushi is alright. Not amazing and not terrible.  I like the variety of appetizers they had.  I also liked the deep fried banana,  which is a little different item than you would normally get at other sushi places."}
{"text":"Come here quite often with my boyfriend and his family. This is their favorite place for sushi. Why? Cause of the **10% off coupon** that can be found here http://www.ccue.ca/tor/restaurants/sushionseven_coupon/. 

Place is pretty small, I'd say it could fit...45-50 people (but it would be pretty tight). It's a clean place, nothing too fancy.

Food is pretty decent, nothing outstanding, nothing that was terrible. Canned pop is included with the buffet price. The cuts of sashimi are usually a good thickness and size. Not like some other restaurants that are pretty stingy when it comes to sashimi.
Dinner dessert menu has creme brulee and mango pudding. I'm a fan of the creme brulee.

Service, is alright. Once again, nothing outstand, but nothing that was terrible. They get the job done. Clear the table as soon as a dirty plate appears, we always get what we order (nothing missing). Don't expect service with a smile though, they seem so serious."}
{"text":"Food is crap, and for all the people that thinks this is good, I advise you to try other places. Sushi fun is pretty good most of the time for AYCE."}
{"text":"I went to the lunch buffet for $12.99 on a Wednesday afternoon. It wasn't that busy in there because we went around 2:30pm. We thought that the lunch buffet included sashimi but it didn't. They had a huge variety of foods to choose from. Most of them were cooked appetizer typed foods. The squid skewers were chewy. I had to spit it out because my jaw got tired from chewing on it in order to swallow it. The squid balls were fishy. The grilled mackerel was pretty good. It was a nice portion and nicely cooked. Their noodle dishes were a bit bland. I wouldn't recommend it. The pork katsu don was okay. The pork was delicious but the rice wasn't too appealing. Their sushi was pretty good. I enjoyed the 1 colour roll which was salmon sushi with salmon sashimi on top. There wasn't an excessive amount of rice on the sushi, which was good. I really liked the fact that their ice cream flavors included green tea, red bean, and mango. The green tea was a little clumpy but it still tasted like green tea. Their fried ice cream wasn't like the regular fried ice cream I have had before. They just sprinkled bread crumbs on top of it. Their fried banana was yummy. I would have preferred honey drizzled on top instead of maple syrup, but hey, we're in Canada. We stayed there until 4:30. The staff wasn't that friendly, but they didn't rush us to get out. Sushi on 7 is an okay place to go."}
{"text":"Decent small ayce place service is attentive and food is good. Id rather go here than yangs over sized tiny tables. Food is comparable service is better."}
{"text":"I was going to give 2 stars but decided on three because of the extensive menu.  This menu is overwhelming however and they don't have menu slips to write down your selections.  Also the maki rolls are huge, with far too much rice.  If you are trying to fill me up you are not fooling me, lol.  Still on the search for a good AYCE japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I have to update my review on this restaurant.  

I went today in hopes of stuffing myself with cheap sushi.  But now the below mediocre sushi is not so cheap.  Sushi on 7 have added $2 to their dinner price bringing the price up to $21.99 - that is unforgivable. & yes I said unforgivable because of the quality they serve.  

The menu is the least extensive menu I have seen in Markham and they have a very inconvenient 'ordering system' and the waitresses end up handing you the wrong item, as they don't completely understand what you actually ordered when they write it down. 
The rolls look sad.  Even though the restaurant does not try to fill you up on rice with their rolls - the quality of the roll is below average with lukewarm sushi that lines the top of dragon rolls.  The fact there is no black dragon roll also made me sad.
Their food timing is also whack. I ordered rice with egg and beef .. this comes out 10 minutes AFTER all the teriyaki dishes have been destroyed by my boyfriend - why does it take 25 minutes to make a rice?  

Even though I have listed negatives - let's focus on something positive.
The one male English speaker is very efficient and responds promptly when you push the service button (conveniently provided on the side of your table).
They serve sashimi scallops.
Their creme brûlée remains amazing.
These positives have added to 1 star.

I won't be back as their price-competitive edge is not so competitive anymore for sad sushi."}
{"text":"for $20. unlimited sushi, u cant go wrong!!!
regular stop every time we at Canada."}
{"text":"This is my favourite AYCE sushi restaurant in Markham. The prices are decent, especially with their 10% off coupon. The sushi is always fresh and food comes out pretty fast. Their non-sushi options like beef ribs are also delicious. I avoid this place during the lunch crowd as it is popular with people who work in Markham. Show up at 1pm and its pretty easy to get a table.

They recently experimented with some new desert options. The \"creme brule\" was more like a creme caramel. Stick with the green tea and red bean ice cream.
The service has some room for improvement. Often i will sit there with an empty tea cup. I have to work to flag someone down, and they will come pretty quickly."}
{"text":"So hard for me to rate a All You Can Eat places fairly as I am not really into AYCE anything.... but when 2 of my dinner mates tonight are fans of  \"eat as much as they can!\", I caved in.

Make sure print out a coupon from www.ccue.com that entitled 10% off if paying by cash.

Dinner Weekdays -  Adult $18.99 

Surprisingly busy for a rainy weekday evening. Sushi on 7 was packed at it's full capacity. Services were OK, efficient and we got all the food we ordered quickly.

Sashimi was OK, thickly sliced salmon was quite freshly. 

The rolls I found them Meh. 

The cooked dish: fried dumplings, grilled baby ribs (charred), grilled shrimps (definitely not fresh with mushy texture), beef on skewers, grilled salmon head and neck....

The fried ice cream is really a scoop of ice cream rolled in crispy bits, but it was quite interesting and give the ice cream an interesting texture.

10% tips added on automatically, so don't double tip.

I think I am bias with AYCE, quantity over quality, not by cup of tea!"}
{"text":"Great fresh sashami. The rolls are a little heavy on the rice. The fried prawn skewers are excellent -- the crunchy shells are delicious. The fried tempura banana with ice cream is ravishing; I love the combination of these hot and cold treats. The restaurant is clean and often packed. Make a reservation 15 minutes before you arrive and ask for a booth. The booths are awesome.

* Update - service is not so great."}
{"text":"Service here was prompt but the lunch menu sucked. Not much selection. Was not satisfied at all. Btw the name has changed to Sushi 8, don't know why.. Same sushi chef and waiters."}
{"text":"Since I live around the area, I've heard lots about this place so I had high hopes coming in!

The sashimi was quite fresh actually, and they serve delicious grilled fish (basa, mackerel...). I'd give them 4 stars for sashimi and cooked fish!

Sushi was only okay. Flying fish roe (tobiko) is SO extremely salty!! This is 2 stars.

TIP: You can get 10% discount if you PRINT an online coupon (but you must pay by cash). And you must PRINT it... We pleaded with them because our coupon was on our phone (lol the power of smartphones), the waitress kept rolling her eyes, \"We cannot allow this. If we did, everyone would just look up coupons and show it.\"

Well, yeah. What is the difference between the paper coupon and the image on the phone? The coupon doesn't even have a unique code.

Since the restaurant wasn't too busy, the manager passed by our waitress and said, \"It's okay, they can have the discount.\"

The manager was kind but he became annoyed easily. The staff were alright, and they also get annoyed easily. My party of 8, as you'd imagine, just shouted random orders the moment a waiter stops by. Think about it, if they do not offer paper menus (like a buffet checklist!), they should expect that we will shout our orders. How can you shake your head like we're annoying you? How can you be grumpy like that?

I'm going to conclude that.... sashimi and grilled fish are amazing! But come here with a party of 2."}
{"text":"Buffet style Japanese place.  Grilled shrimp skewers and squid were excellent.  Beef skewers were not.  Steamed seafood egg was delicious as I've never had one before.  Sashimi of salmon and butterfish (i think it was butterfish) was freakin amazing.  Their rolls were pretty great too.  I ordered some sushi pizza which was interesting.  The bottom is flattened rice that has been breaded and fried with whatever sushi topping you want.  I probably wouldn't order it again although I'm glad I tried it.   Shrimp tempura tasted standard.  Overall it was a good find."}
