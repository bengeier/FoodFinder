{"text":"We ordered 3 chicken shawarmas, a beef shawarma and a beef samosa. The beef samosa was very big and packed with meat. It was a bit spicy but not so strong that it would burn your mouth.

The shawarma wasn't that big compared to other places but I liked that it was warmed on a panini press first. They were 2 for $8.50 so for the price, it was good."}
{"text":"To be honest the shawarma is nothing to write home about. Yes , Johnny's got a big heart and he's doing everything right on the social media to promote his business - the mans gotta eat, right? Drive along Lawrence from Kennedy to pharmacy - there are tons of shawarma places. If Johnny's shawarma is the only shawarma place in 50 miles radius then hands down - it's the best place in town."}
{"text":"Fast efficient service, with a good selection of toppings for shwarma dinner plates, good humus and hot sauce. Good portions with the offer of a pita for more."}
{"text":"For real fresh food that is unbelievably tasty do yourself a favor and come to johnny's shawarma to satisfy your hunger and taste buds. Fresh ingredients, great quality meats, quick and friendly service with a pleasant atmosphere and great location. In fact I think I'll be going there soon it's been too long, see you there."}
{"text":"Delicious and addicting Shawarma Wraps. The folks behind the counter are friendly and keep the line moving. Clean and inviting atmosphere. I come back at least once a month or more. The Samosas are excellent too."}
{"text":"2 dinner plate for $15! Vert tasty chicken and beef. Excellent customer service. Definitely a place we'll return to."}
{"text":"JOHNNYS the best shawarma in town...and trust me ive had a ton in the GTA. 

The meat is juicy and flavourful...without any unwanted fat or dry taste. 

Its healthy, filling, and priced fairly. If you are in the kennedy/401 area definitely stop by and you will leave with a full and satisfied stomach."}
{"text":"+ Fast and friendly - I think most of Johnny's customers are on a first name basis!
+ Healthier shawarmas
+ Clean and welcoming dining area, recently renovated

I've been a regular customer at Johnny's for several years now and I don't think the cravings will ever stop. The service here is amazing, and they treat you like family the moment you step through the door.

Johnny's Shawarma has, in my opinion, the best shawarmas in Toronto. They are not nearly as greasy as most other shawarma places, and they have the best pickled turnips. The garlic spread they use is made in-house and creates a very unique flavour that no other shawarma places have.

Along with their shawarmas, I recommend their plated dinners (my regular order) - huge portions and so very tasty - lentil rice, potato salad, tabule, hummus, a pita with garlic spread, and of course, your choice of chicken/beef/mix/veggie/falafel. 

I typically get sick of my regular spots after a few months, but Johnny's is the only place I've been frequenting regularly for years. In Toronto (and the GTA) where shawarma places are a dime a dozen, Johnny's stands-out front and center for their quality of food, the warm staff, and the cozy dining area."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here for lunch a few times a month. The shawarma's that we have had were always fresh and delicious. I have recently tried the shawarma meat over salad and was not disappointed. The staff members are always so kind and welcoming the moment you walk through the door. The portions and prices are great! I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I read multiple reviews before trying Johnnys! We have had delicious shawarma time and time again, but we were disappointed when the reviews told us \"best shawarma\" you will ever have. Don't get me wrong, it did taste great! But it didn't have those strong spice and garlic flavours that a shawarma should have. Overall very fresh ingredients and great service- I just wish for a more BOOM! taste when it hits my tongue."}
{"text":"I came in for lunch with my mother and we were amazing with the delicious shawarma's and amazing staff. 


I totally recommend everyone to try this place out.
Definitely my new shawarma place!!

Thanks Johnny!"}
{"text":"Looked really good when I first opened my delivery order, but to my disappointment, it tasted like it was leftovers from a few days ago (the chicken was hard and the pita was like a rock). Would not order again. Staff was very friendly though."}
{"text":"A clean little take out place with a few tables of 4 and a nice corner booth that my girlfriend and I occupied.

The service was really good, people serving with a smile.

The food was really good. I got the mix (chicken and beef) dinner plate, personally thought the beef was better because it was a tad juicier than the chicken, but overall both was good. The pricing was fair for the amount you get. I think it was $21 for 2 dinners. I really like the garlic sauce, hummus, and tabouli that they include."}
{"text":"I've tried a few shwarma places and this was one of the better ones. It was the super friendly customer service that would get me to come back.  Decent food at a decent price. Small place when you walk in but there's enough room to find a seat, while we were here lots of people coming through. The guys at the counter made it a point to say bye to everyone, nice place & will be back"}
{"text":"Best lunch spot, amazing food, & great price.
Johnny is awesome too."}
{"text":"Few places where they put their heart into making your food, this is one of them. Love it when a cook shows pride in making food for you. One of the best shawarma chicken wraps ever."}
{"text":"Horrible. I don't know about these reviews but the chicken Sharma was the worst I ever had
 The chicken was as dry and cardboard and was hard as a rock. Fed it to my dog."}
{"text":"Tried the beef shawarma yesterday. It was good but a bit pricey for the size of the sandwich. You get the best shawarmas at Lawrence and Ghadir's is the best of the best."}
{"text":"I used Urbanspoon to find a good Shawarma place in my area. Johnnys all had excellent reviews. The prices are excellent and they also had excellent customer service. The Chicken Shawarma dinner was ok, I have had better at Shawarma Queen in Brampton. Johnnys is definetly a place to visit if you live near by for a great price and decent food, I've just had much better in the past. I did really appreciate the great customer service as we all know that can be hard to come by!"}
{"text":"One of the best beef shawarma I'm the city. Great price too. Can get two shawarma for 10 bucks !"}
{"text":"The guy argued with me about showing me the receipt for wether if its halal or not. You cannot trust people like this."}
{"text":"Johnny's shawarmas is a family business in the heart of Scarborough! One thing that really made me an on-going customer here is the staff.

Each time I walk through the door a large friendly greeting is made - lots of enthusiasm and smiles passed around.

My boyfriend introduced me to this place and ever since then it's one of our favourite spots.

A classic must try is the Shawarma Poutine! 
Never thought I'd get my two favourite things in one? 

Definitely a"}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service at this local shawarma joint run by some really nice guys. 

The food is consistently fresh, the meat is tender (though it could use a bit more seasoning), and the hot sauce is a bit mild for my liking. 

My go-to place whenever I'm craving a shawarma, and it's conveniently located by my parents place!"}
{"text":"THis is a little shawarma place located on the west side of kennedy road is this shawarma place. It's almost too small to see. Johnny is a nice guy, and he seems to be real earnest in his attempts. He said that his Shawarma was better than Dearborn Michigans, which is quite the boast. While I applaud his gaul, he doesn't quite match up to the best in Dearborn. But then again, outside of the Middle East, who does?

Despite the falls braggadicio the food was decent. The prices were good, and I was happy being there. It was definitely A-ok"}
{"text":"Ordered the 2 for $10.00 shawarma sandwich special, one chicken and one beef. I must say the staff here are extremely welcoming, friendly and courteous. Dining room is clean, inviting. Wraps tasted very good, garlic sauce especially. Very disappointed with the portion size though Wraps just didn't seem \"stuffed\" enough, I expected more veggies inside.

Sorry guys, but there's other places better."}
{"text":"The staff are nice.  The food was all right.  It seemed very pre-prepared and had to be warmed in a microwave as the meal was put together, which gave the feel of having leftovers, and concerns about food storage temperatures.  We had a mixed plate shawarma dinner with salad, beef and chicken.  Vegetables could be fresher.  The tomatoes were mealy and eggplant looked dry and had a tinge to it.  It seems like they're just not set up to serve hot food.  It's more like a small town all-in-one convenience set-up than a proper take-out restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty decent. Flavour was good.  Some sharwmas are so packed and you eat it and the food falls all over the place, and the sauce drops everywhere, and god forbid your on a date and eat like a mess.  I liked the concept of the two shawrmas and good edible sizes at a good price point.  I mean at the end of the day, the food is pretty straight forward, but its tasty and the quality of the food was there.  Lineup was kind of long, i think the crew in front of me ordered for like 10 people, kind of a pet peeve, and the location is rather small.  You get that feeling of being crammed into a sardine can but it was worse for the kitchen staff.  Small space to work with, with all that heat behind them.  (you'll see the setup when you go).  But the service was polite and you could tell these guys work their ass off, so at the end of the day they get my respect, and when there are big lineups during peak hours you have to practice patience.  It would be nice one day to see this place renovate or expand, make use of their space a bit better or find a pro who can create space out of nothing.  Lol, but otherwise, happy to have found this place, and yea, I'll be back."}
{"text":"It's the best food I've eaten. the place is small but super cozy, modern and clean, and the staff is the best of all, they are super friendly, attentive, always serving with a smile. 100% recommended!"}
{"text":"Good food. Well prepared and reasonably priced. Great service. Warm friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Amazing local joint. I would go again just for the service alone. The owner is very friendly and you can tell he cares about his business and the quality of the food. Would definitely visit in the future and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"I've given this place a few chances but I've never liked anything I've had here.   Friends of mine tell me they like it here but in my opinion there are better shawarma places nearby"}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with this place if you want a Shawarma sandwich or plate. Open late. I've been coming here on and off for over 10 years and it's been the same owner since it opened. This is not a full service restaurant. It's more of a quick fast food style but the food is really good. The tabouli salad is always good with fresh parsley,olive oil, chunks of tomatoes, onions and lemon juice and sea salt compared to some of the franchised Middle Eastern fast food places where they skimp on everything to the point that it doesn't look or taste anything like a real tabouli.  Cool when owner speaks Arabic to the many Middle Eastern customers that come here which speaks volume about the place.
Very basic place with great shawarma that everyone appreciates at great prices that does not break the wallet. 
I recommend without hesitation. Eat up!! :)"}
{"text":"I'm not in the east end too often but if I am in the area I always happen to end up at Johnny's. Their really fast, everyone is friendly and and although the prices went up so it's a little overpriced for a sgawarma spot the food is still really good so I can't complain too much. I love their veggie plate pretty much for the eggplant & fried cauliflower.  Their beef sgawarma is actually really good too and I'm usually very picky with the shawarmas."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this place and I got the falafel wrap, with hot sauce. It was seriously delicious - warm, with crispy and really flavourful falafel, a great garlic sauce, pickles, lettuce, tomato, onion and parsley. I loved it - will definitely go back. Also, the service was great - the guys were really busy, but super nice and made everyone welcome."}
{"text":"I work next to the place and its the only thing I like to eat for lunch, it's fresh, filling, and tastes really good, not to mention their outstanding prices. Staff is very friendly and welcoming. Overall it's the best halal food place in the area if you need something that's quick and tastes good."}
{"text":"Worse sharwarma place ever! It's expensive for the quality you're getting and nothing is fresh in there. I ordered a beef sharwarma plate and was so very disappointed. The meat didn't taste very good and was extremely greasy, the sauces were watered down and the rice was microwaved. Literally, I watched the guy put the rice in the bowl, threw it in the microwave and then dumped the rice in the box. I'm not a picky eater and I've eaten in some of the worse buffets and still thought it was OK. Here, no, this place absolutely sucks. It's the kind of food that you have regrets eating for days to come. Every bite is really a mouthful of sadness. 

I shouldn't known the place wasn't very good given there was not a single soul in the restaurant during the dinner rush hour. Not recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Johnny's Shawarma for years.  I usually get the Chicken Shawarma platter about 4 times a year and whenever I go, it is such a treat.  

First, I gotta mention the staff.  There are 2 guys that work there and they are fun, energetic, care about where you come from and what you're eating.  If you're an introvert , you may find them a bit forward but hey, they're really nice.  Second, the food.  The Chicken Shawarma platter is a heaping good time.  Here's what my order contains:

Chicken Shawarma (White Meat)
Lentils & Rice
Greek Salad
Potato Salad
Pita with Garlic Sauce
Hummus

Weekday nights after 5 PM or 6 PM, the Shawarma platter is discounted to $8.25.  They give you a 10 punch card so the 10th Shwarma sandwich is free or $5 off the platter, which keeps you coming back.

The thing about Johnny's is that their Shawarma is DISTINCT.  It has a homely, healthy kinda feel. It is not oily or greasy.  If you are looking for the best shawarma in town, I find that it is all depends on people's taste so you can be searching according to your palatte.  But if you want to have 100% excellent service, generous portions, you have come to the right place.

Love this place and will definitely return again and again."}
{"text":"My cousin loves this place and wanted to take me while I was visiting Toronto. It's a little hole in the wall-- you wouldn't know how nice it was from the outside. This was my first time eating shwarma and it was beyond delicious. The little french fry baskets are so cute! I was so satisfied with my beef shwarma. Staff was also super friendly! I can't wait to come back in the summer."}
{"text":"Been going here for a number of years and they have always been consistent with their shawarma's. They always add the right amount of ingredients and press the wrap to perfection! Most shawarma places that I have been to either serve the wrap cold or the chicken in it is way to dry. I will continue to come here and support this place! Also the service is always good! They know how to treat their customers!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident as it's in the same plaza as my nail/wax lady (shout out to D&K spa nails). As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the owner who is usually there everyday , his dad is usually sitting at a table but doesn't work behind the counter. No matter how long the line is he will acknowledge you. He knows who his regulars are and he is quite the comedian lol . There is always a line up, which to me is a great sign.
So if you're in a rush call ahead and place your order. 
The food is by far one of my top 3 shawarma joints. Seasoning, quality, options ,taste all top notch. I usually get the chicken shawarma with hummus , taziki, lettuce , tomatoes, xtra onions and touch of garlic. Mouth watering , sometimes I can eat two in one sitting (yes I am greedy lol) I mean prices are great too, so why not!
So if your in the area definitely Check the place out! You won't be disappointed ."}
{"text":"Insanely friendly owner is very accommodating. Great food at a cheat price along with that and you just can't go wrong. 

Only thing is you really need to watch it or you will drive right by this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place is not good at all. They use stale chicken and doesn't have the authentic shawarma taste. Portions are very tiny with less meat. Best place for shawarma is Amazing Shawarma!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. amazing Shawarma, friendly staff,
Small dining area, nice décor. 
take out or snack
$5.5+tx for beef or chicken shawarma 
Beef was amazing. very well done."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their sharwarma: chicken was warm & everything was fresh ! My dear friend took me there for late lunch. We took our sharwarma TO GO. 
Bad?? too far from downtown core !"}
{"text":"You know the routine, it's past 1pm and you haven't had your lunch yet. So you hop on Yelp and seek your next meal. You see shawarma and giggle like a little girl. But you haven't been there yet, but then see some good reviews about how scrumptious the shawarmas are and decide to give it a go based on many good reviews.

ABORT! I REPEAT, ABORT MISSION! ITS A CODE RED!

But in all seriousness. The decor is somewhat welcoming, as is the persons. When you walk in they greet you like you're related, which is odd because I'm East Asian and they're not. If you're a talkative guy, prepare to have a nice conversation about your life.

I got a chicken shawarma wrap, quick and easy. When I took it out of the bag, I thought something wasn't right. I then realized it was the shawarma...it was the smallest shawarma wrap I have ever seen. $5.49 plus tax.

The wrap was just fine, nothing exciting. Maybe I was just too hungry, who knows. But the amount of chicken and veggies in there was virtually nonexistent. If you're looking for a nice conversation with some nice people, this is your spot. But if it's for a decent sized shawarma that takes great, I would abort mission."}
{"text":"The place is overrated and the owner is a loser. Dont bother asking for more garlic sauce he will get pissed off at you. Over priced and cold potatoes."}
{"text":"Great tasting chicken shawarma wrap but there was hardly any chicken smh cheap on the meat not a good way to keep ppl coming back. Stay away from the fries too yuck!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular since moving to the neighbourhood. I've just moved away...and missing the food and the boys already...except you, Andy...but seriously...Andy, I miss you, too"}
