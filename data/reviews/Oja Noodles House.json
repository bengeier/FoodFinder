{"text":"Living in downtown, I have been to numerous Sushi places.  I must say that this place, especially in terms of the overall value for the money, is amongst probably that best 5% of the sushi places in downtown."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally for lunch, dinner, and take-out and am glad that a friend introduced me to this place last year (2010). Haven't eaten anything off the Korean side of the menu though so my review is strictly for the Japanese items.

Serivce is good. Food is also good. Nothing to rave about, but it is solidly good. Price point is fantastic (great balance of fresh and cheap sashimi). I usually favour specialty Japanese places found in the suburbs but when I get a craving and need something close by, Oja does the trick.

I order off the lunch menu often, which includes a green salad (which I hate) and miso soup (decent). They are fairly quick with lunch orders, so it's nice to not be stressed about being taking a really long lunch. A roll (or a combination of rolls) and/or sashimi is what I usually go for. My go to is #5, the spicy salmon roll and 8 pieces of salmon sashim, for $10.95.

And I almost always get the agedashi tofu. Not too battered or dense, but not too fancy either. Sometimes, they put too much teriyaki sauce and sometimes, it's just right. 

In sum:

PROS:
-price vs quality
-location
-friendly, speedy service

CONS:
-inconsistent"}
{"text":"Man, what a fantastic bowl of noodle soup. I tried the samsun jampong and I was not disappointed. Spicy, perfectly cooked thick noodles, and a big pile of seafood and veggies.

If you like Korean food do yourself a favor and check this place out, your stomach will thank you."}
{"text":"Oja is pretty much my go to sushi restaurant. I basically have the same thing when I go. Their bento boxes are great. I usually get the bento box, dynamite tempura, and an egg drop soup. I go there as it's consistent almost every time I go there. I've been going there for about 3 years faithfully now. Overall, it's a pretty alright place."}
{"text":"I took my parents here on a whim while they were visiting me this weekend. We arrived very early for lunch and there was no one in the restaurant yet. The service was good. I liked the simple decor in the place. 

The food arrived very quickly. The fried dumplings were lovely and the spring rolls were very nice and super crispy. 

My father and I both ordered the Beef Bulgogi Hot pots and my Mother ordered a chicken Yakisoba. The Bulgogi Hot Pots were VERY hot. I think we both burned our tongues but that was our own fault. The dish was delicious. The beef was plentiful and tender. I loved how crispy the rice got on the bottom of the hot pot. 

Mom had a hard time picking up her noodles with the metal chopsticks provided but her dish was very tasty as well. The three of us could have easily shared two dishes. We had lots of leftovers for dinner.

The price was right on at about $12 per person plus tax and tip."}
{"text":"I've frequented Oja for many years and introduced many friends to this place. The owners are absolutely lovely and always greet me with a big hello and smile. The food is on par with what you pay. The sushi here is really good and the portions are much bigger than traditional sushi places. My favourite: the Hawaiian Volcano. There's plenty of variety at this Japanese + Korean hangout. You've got sushi, bento boxes, kimchee, noodles, vegetarian fare. It's located right in the heart of Yonge and Bloor with both table and booth seating. Great for a first date, meet up with friends, date night with your significant other, or just dropping in on your own for a quick bite! Definitely not high-end by any means (avoid the restrooms) but great value, great food, and a nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Nice small family own restaurant, cozy intimate environment. Usually come here for the big mouth size sushi. Nice variety and the quality tastes pretty good."}
{"text":"I would give a zero star if I could. Service was horrible, and our food all came out at different time so we all had to take turns watch the other person eat, not to mention they forgot one of our order (which came about an hour later after we asked for it). The highlight was when my dish came out (which was supposed to be a hot dish), it was cold, so I asked the waitress, and her answer was \"Oh, it seemed bit too hot, so I rinsed your noodle in cold water\" At that point, I think I just lost it and started laughing."}
{"text":"Lot's of choice about menu! 
It's noodle house so i tried one of the noodle and I liked it. I had Shanghai noodle and the amount was good and it was very tasty! A bit salty for me though.
There are Japanese, Korean, Chinese foods on the menu. And the location is nice. I want to try another menu someday! :)"}
{"text":"They have some of the best legit Korean food in the area. The glass noodle was good.The server was very nice and polite. Would definitely go back there and bring more friends. I would recommend this place if you're around the area and looking for some Korean or Japanese food."}
{"text":"We use to come to Oja frequently many years ago.
It comforting to find out that the food is still very good and reasonably priced.
We had the BBQ short ribs and fried meat dumplings for appetizers.
The short ribs were very tender and flavorful. 
The fried beef dumplings were good. I prefer a more tart and hot dipping sauce but it was fine.
We had the Japanese Teriyaki Chicken and the Korean Spicy Pork dinner.
The chicken was moist without being overly sweet. They serve it with a bowl of miso soup and a refreshing salad at the start of the meal.
The spicy pork came with rice, Kimichi, pickled daikon and beans.
It had a reasonable amount of spice.
I would be happy to order this dish again or try the same dish as chicken or beef.
We ended up taking half our dinner home so I would probably skip the appetizers...
maybe not, the BBQ ribs were so good.
I guesss our last visit there was some 8 years ago. 
Prices haven't risen that much. Back then, Bulgogi beef was $7.95 (I have a good memory for price of items) and today it $9.95 and the portions are still huge.

Thanks Oja, we'll be back more frequently."}
{"text":"Recently moved into the area and was looking for good sushi spot. Finally found OJA after trying many disappointing places in the area! Service is amazing and the food is always fresh and delicious. I am now a regular customer! Must try!"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed last night, I ordered a pork katsu and chirashi don, the pork is super thin?the inside was dry and the 2 pcs of shrimp tempura was like 2 big pcs of dough without tempura sauce. the chirashi? OMG?it was hot steam rice instead ofsushi rice?can you imagine that? it was hot steam rice? then I asked for change?they gived me sushi rice with the old sashimi on the top?salmon was not bad when I tasted tuna?it was so fishy?definitely not fresh?to be honest?this is the worsest sushi that I ever had?will not come back?by the way the service was not bad?so I still gave 15? for the tips?food is sucks is not sever waiter's fault."}
{"text":"Tonight, half way through my kimchi soup I have found a dead cockroach swimming in. Ugh! To make things better, the waitress explained to me that they are treating the kitchen against bugs and this must be why a cockroach fell into my soup... I was of course more than happy to learn that they applied the insecticide without clearing out the kitchen first, and that I have most certainly eaten a fair amount of it. Sure I feel better now. Bottom line, I do NOT recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Food overall are pretty good. Used to be one of my favorite restaurant to go in high school. Revisiting after 4 years . N9 spicy noodles is still one of my favorite!"}
{"text":"Good food. Bulgogi was a bit too shredded for my liking but overall flavour is good. Ordered the bbq for 2, comes with miso soup, rice, spicy chicken, galbi (beef short ribs), bulgogi and three types of sides. Good value and plenty of food!"}
{"text":"I have been to South Korea and this place is very close to the flavors we tried there. The service is fast and the food is delicious. My friend had a bibimbap that she raved about until she left the city and I had a combination of vegetarian sweet noodle and rice. We were served traditional appetizers that come with almost any order of the main dish. It was very good and very affordable for the amount and quality that you get. I absolutely recommend and hope to get back there with my hubby. He is a Korean food enthusiast as well. 

The decor is nice and cozy. I think it is a good place to catch up with a friend and relax. It is family friendly and looked clean."}
{"text":"This is a favorite in our office. It claims to be Korean/Japanese but I personally don't really like their sushi. The Korean Food is really what shines here.

My one coworker loves the Hawaii Roll (Dragon with Spicy Tuna) and the Kimchi Chigae. He goes back and forth between the two. I however, have found the best dish on the menu and cannot possibly ever stray. Kimchi Udon. I love this Kimchi Udon more than any other Udon Soup I have ever had. Maybe Noodle Soup Even. It is slurpingly, sweatingly,  completely and ridiculously fabulous. I also think its about $6.95. Ask for the Korean Apps, those little dark beans are fantastic here and they will bring you some if they aren't too busy.

I have only 3 complaints.

- Washrooms are not really accessible.. Through the kitchen, up the stairs and in the back. 
- Service is good, but they don't really work with the office/lunch crowd. We are rushing, and it would be nice to get and be able to pay our bills swiftly.
- Green Tea is not free. They Charge, and it is bagged tea not a pot. I like Tea with Japanese Food.

Lunch Specials (Roll with Soup or Bento Box offerings) in the $10 - $12 range.  They also are very accommodating to our last minute/large party reservation requests."}
{"text":"Ok place for lunch,bad for dinner.i order fired noose with chicken. Not good:( but location is great. Not a lot ppl in the lunch.if u are hungry,come and drop by."}
{"text":"Last time I was here, it was over 5 years ago. I didn't return for awhile because I found the food mediocre and the service poor. The fact that the restaurant is still around in the Yonge and Bloor area is a good sign.

I gave it another chance and would come back for their cheap lunch deals. There are many lunch specials under $10 before tax. 

My friend and I ordered the bento box with chicken teriyaki and sushi. 

What I didn't like:
-The salad dressing was too acidic.
-The teriyaki sauce was too salty. They probably added more soy sauce to the bottled stuff 

What I did like:
-The salad dressing was made in-house and not your bottled Thousand Island dressing. 
-Great bang for buck. The box was $10.95 before tax and I was full."}
{"text":"Comme la plupart des restaurants type \"asian-confusion\" on ne sait si c'est japonais, coréen ou un mélange des deux. Pas une grande découverte, rien de très remarquable mais pas mauvais non plus."}
{"text":"Due to the location, Oja is my go to sushi place.

I have both ordered take out (my usual) as well as eaten in, both experiences were great.  I usually call about 15 mins ahead and my order is ready for me when I arrive.

The rolls are always fresh and the portions are large enough that one roll will be enough for one person.  

Prices are on par with other sushi restaurants in the area, usually costs my wife and I under $30 total for our dinner.  Great customer service, always happy to accommodate special orders.

There are definitely some better high-end sushi places in the city but for me, the convenience, the high quality food and the great customer service cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner. We ordered the Spicy Rice Cake, Bulgogi Dinner, Spicy Pork and the Shrimp Shanghai Noodle. 

Overall, everything was good, I wasn't a fan of the spicy rice cake, mainly because i didn't like the mushy texture of the rice. The sauce on it was delicious though and i used it on all of the other dishes. Four of us shared these four dishes and it was more than enough. We were stuffed. Three dishes would have been plenty. 

Good food for an even better price."}
{"text":"I met an old grandma who got lost and could not speak any single English word at Toronto Royal Museum today and I took her to this Korean restaurant to ask for help from Korean people.The owner of this restaurant was a great gentle man, he treated the old Korean lady a free meal [ Seafood Tempura Combo ] and promised to drive this the old lady home after the meal in case she got lost again. I personally tried green Dragon sushi and cold noodles ,they were tasty and authentic.All in all, the kindness the owner showed warmed my Toronto trip."}
{"text":"It seems like giving a one star rating is harsh...
but really, this is one of the worst Korean restaurants I've ever eaten in.

Service was horrible.
Unless you are into being completely ignored.

I ordered bip bim bap with beef.
...On the menu, they should rename it Bip-Bim-find-any-meat-if-you-can-we're-too-cheap-to-give-you-a-real-serving-Bap.

I was so hungry after I was ready to kill my own cow and throw it on a Korean grill... with an egg..and rice...

Anyways, OJA, I shake my fist at you."}
{"text":"I ordered spicy chicken take-out. The chicken was very strange. It did not look like chicken. I thought they gave me squid by accident but it was chicken, yet it was very dry looking. It tasted dry; like chicken that was old. Maybe it was marinated then dried??? The spicy sauce was too sweet. The side dishes were lame. And the rice was undercooked. I also ordered salmon and avocado roll; but again the rice was undercooked. I was hungry so ate everything, but in the end I was very unsatisfied. I don't think I'll go back."}
{"text":"I ordered bibimbap and it was good. My boyfriend ordered their tofu soup with beef and mussels. It came with lots of tofu, a few pieces of ground beef and no mussels. And only 3 side dishes. Everything here at this restaurant was just okay but not memorable. Had better korean food in yonge-finch area"}
{"text":"Oja is a river in La Rioja, Spain. So, I don't know what its doing as the name of a Korean noodle house.

I was shopping for a proper pair of hiking shoes, didn't find them. I couldn't wait until I got home to eat, so I decided to step into Spring Rolls for a quick bite. But after being greeted by the waitress upon entering, I realized this wasn't Spring Rolls. The doors was so small, and both the restaurants looked alike! I should have been assertive and turned to leave, but I chickened out and took my seat. 
Oh this place was in a perpetual state of autumn. There are dried leaves glued to the wall which was painted dirty amber. There were patches of strange shaped white things on the ceiling which seemed to be cracking. They looked like giant albino leeches. The little light torches seemed to be a nice touch, until you've taken a closer look, which appeared to have never been cleaned. 

One stoic Man stood behind the bar, one older lady coming in and out from the kitchen, and one young waitress working the floor. I'm guessing family restaurant. It's a humble space with a crowd pattern I never seen before. It was either girls, or boys. Never mixed together. Obviously this must have been an odd day, because there was no parade of naked people on Yonge. 

Ordering the food was easy enough, there were photos of almost all the dishes. I got the chicken katsu bento box, and a platter of three different kinds of sushi. This was actually more food than I would have liked, but the photos tricked my hunger into thinking it is greater than it was. 
The wait was reasonable, and the service came in the form of a young 26ish woman. 
The food was unremarkable. Nothing stood out. The spicy tuna roll was perhaps the only thing that kept my mouth chewing. 
Honestly, not a single table where the genders mixed. 
I paid $40 including tips. 
I couldn't figure out whether if this was overpriced, or if I'm just a pig.

I stepped out to look at the sign and figure out what restaurant I accidentally ate in, it said Oja. I had to write that down."}
{"text":"This place has both Korean and Japanese food. It's a bit quieter than other restaurants in the area but that made it so much more pleasant to catch up with a friend in. The service is really friendly and the family who owns this place seem like lovely people. 

I opted for a chicken teriyaki bento for dinner. It's nothing too exciting, but the tempura was fresh and crunchy, the chicken had good flavour, and the fried tofu was a good addition. The food came out promptly and hot, as it should.

I'd go back for the shrimp tempura, or to try their many special rolls. They also have decently priced drinks, so maybe next time we'll try those."}
{"text":"I frequent this place often as its in the area where I live. The service is inconsistent. I've had horrible waiting staff to really nice ones. 

The food is decent and the price is not on the cheaper scale but may not be on par with the quality of the food. You have to go up to the counter to pay. The glass noodle Jap Chae was too sweet for my liking. They did not have pork bone soup which is rare for a korean restaurant (granted this was a korean cum japanese restaurant). 

Its a surprise this place has survived the yonge street rent with such poor service but I return each time as I'm seated quickly, the food is decent and I want to support the family operated restaurants.

I wish they gave the small side dishes with every order as a gesture. I thought one of our orders came with that and when I asked for it before the main was served the waitress told me (with great difficulty as english was not her first language) that it did not come with any of our orders only to find that what she meant was that the order that it DID come with - it will be served together with that main.

Will give it a few more chances till I change my review."}
{"text":"This is one of many Asian restaurants along Yonge south of Bloor. It's a bit unique in that it's Japanese and Korean, so it's not quite pan-Asian, but there is still a decent variety of dishes.

I had the chicken hot pot, which was decent and the portion sizes were generous. The chicken was very tender and the sauce they used was pretty tasty.

Unlike some of the other restaurants in this area, it has full booth seating and is bigger inside than you'd expect (not that it's huge or anything). The service is also very friendly.

All in all, this is a decent spot for lunch."}
{"text":"Quite disappointed cuz the rice cake was still not fully cooked even after I asked the kitchen to re-cook it. Most of the rice cake was hard and almost inedible:( and the waitress says there was nothing that they could do about it........however, the waitress had a nice attitude and the kimchi here tasted good :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by to grab a quick meal before a movie. I was hoping for more Korean dishes but the menu is split between Korean and Japanese dishes. I was craving Gamjatang (pork bone soup) but sadly they don't serve it here. I settled for the Bibimbap with beef which was decent. 

Service was quick and the prices are fairly reasonable."}
{"text":"Service was prompt and friendly. They brought an extra miso soup since I only ordered rolls.

The sushi itself was a bit dry, not enough rice, and it fell apart easily. The salad had way too much dressing on it. I'll check out other places around here instead of coming back though."}
{"text":"The food was gross and there was a tentacle sticking out of my soup when it didn't say there would be a tentacle on the menu.  Afterwards, I headed over to McDonald's because I was so unhappy I didn't touch my meal."}
{"text":"So, we came into this place for a quick bite before seeing a show at the Panasonic Theatre. I've seen this place many times before but never went in. It was a surprisingly nice experience. The beef bulgogi was good, but my sushi platter was even more amazing. It tasted really fresh. The roll was to die for. Our meal came to $30 for two, which is dirt cheap for a good dinner!

That all being said, maybe I should have read the reviews first. The picture of the bug on the plate that was posted here made my stomach turn. And given that two people have wrote about issues with roaches in their food, I'm thinking I won't be back. Very unfortunate!"}
{"text":"It is plain , no side dishes overpriced ... Can find this stuff for better price ... In general I wouldn't go if not necessary."}
{"text":"For a lunch time meal, this place is pretty good. We were in and out in an hour, and they offer some good bento box specials for $9.95
The place was packed, I even saw then turn away people.  I like that they had both a choice of japanese and korean dishes. 
I got a bimbimbap (or rice in hot pot). It was kind of bland for some reason. Correct me if I'm wrong, But I thought they were supposed to use a special kind of rice. 
The plain rice tasted like butter. the bottom got crunchy which I do like, could be because I avoided stirring it there and also all the butter in the rice. I'd give this dish a 2 star
My friend got a shanghai noodles. Sorry dude, that looked nothing lik shanghai noodles. It looked red/orange like they mixed teryaki and hot sauce on it. I'm sure it was tasty tho. 
The staff were friendly and efficient. 

I came here before actually. I had a japchae here and it was good, I didn't see it on the menu tho."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review of this place with one less star simply because my more recent visit, I tried out their sushi. Unfortunately, I would not go here for the sushi. They pack on too much rice, the roll is too large to fit your mouth comfortably and the taste is lacking. I still believe the Korean cuisine this restaurant serves deserves the 4 stars, but the Japanese cuisine, not so much."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a while because the last time I here, I thought the sushi was mediocre and everything else was meh and the service was kind of slow as well.  

I came here recently and had the silken tofu hot pot that came with pork and seafood.  The tofu was nice and smooth and the taste was pretty good.  My coworkers ordered a bento box special and bimibap.  They said it was pretty good.  

However, I found the tofu hot pot to be a bit on the small side and my coworker had to wait a while for his bento box. Overall, I'd say it's decent lunch, but nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"What kind of korean place does NOT serve pork bone soup? Quick lunch spot, but will not return."}
{"text":"A Friday night craving for some good food led us here. We weren't looking for anything specific, so decided to browse the Yonge/Bloor area until we found something that seemed good enough. I was drawn towards the Korean food, and my friend was drawn towards the Japanese food, so in we went.

We shared a Maki Platter consisting of California rolls, Dynamite rolls, and Spicy Salmon roll. I must say, the rolls were much larger than we anticipated and definitely bigger than the standard sizes served elsewhere. As for the taste, lets just say the Spicy Salmon proved to be far too much for my friend.

For our entrees, my friend opted for the Salmon Teriyaki Bento Box, which came with the standard set of vegetable and shrimp tempura, dumplings, and instead of rice, it came with noodles. As for me, I went with the server's recommendation of the Spicy Pork hot pot (which also came with three sides), after being undecided between that and the Marinated Chicken hot pot. It tasted great, but was a bit mild for my taste. I needed that extra kick and the server was more than welcome to bring out both hot sauce and hot pot sauce.

As for the service, our server started out great, making comments and suggestions with our order, all while presenting herself in a friendly manner. However, towards the end of the dinner, the staff had a meal prepared for themselves at the back tables, and neglected to serve the tables at the front of the house. A few tables next to us had to wave them down, that it soon became a frenetic rush to serve all tables at once.

Another strike has to be their washrooms. It's upstairs, around a long, winding hallway, and there was no running water in the faucet of both the men's and women's washroom (haha yes, I went to the women's washroom to try to wash my hands, since I already had a blob of liquid soap on my hands).

But other than that, I'd give them 3.5 stars out of 5, and I'd definitely come back for the food and reasonable prices and selection (the menu also has pictures accompanying most dishes for those not too familiar with Japanese or Korean cuisine)."}
{"text":"Small family owned restaurants are so charming when they love what they do. You can feel if people is working with passion because they will treat you like part of their family giving you the impression of being at home. This happened to me at Oja.

I was starving and by myself walking around Yonge searching for an AYCE something. While passing by the entrance of this restaurant, I saw a bunch of girls talking with a smile and enjoying; there were a couple of couples, and 2 individuals with themselves, so I thought I could be the 3rd one eating single style. 

I ordered the octopus balls appetizer and a spicy Korean soup with tofu, mussels and pork. The food came  fast and I was really touched when they brought to the table: rice, sweet beans, kimchi, and other 2 fresh tapas. I love Korean hospitality because it feels that they want their guest to be satisfy.

The soup was tasty, with a rich red broth, a couple of mussels, and strips of pork. I enjoyed it till it vanished. The appetizer was big (5pics) and it came with this crunchy white strips I've always wondered what they are.

The waiter was excellent, he would be constantly moving and checking every table. When my chopsticks fall down, I didn't say anything, but 3 seconds later, he just appeared with a new set.

I payed $20 and I was more than happy with the meal and time I spent there."}
{"text":"With our stomachs rumbling after a great elite event some of us yelpers went in search of a late night meal, we stumbled upon Oja and decided to dine here. We walked in about 30 minutes prior to closing, despite this fact we were greeted nicely and were never rushed throughout our meal. 

I ordered a beef bibimbap which was pretty good. The rice was sufficiently crunchy, the veggies were cooked nicely (I especially liked the mushrooms), the beef was standard and I liked the fact that they served the hot sauce on the side allowing me to make it as spicy as I felt necessary. My only complaint with this dish was that the egg on top was overcooked, I like the yolk to be runny and it was pretty much solid. Overall this dish was serviceable but nothing outstanding. I also managed to try some of my fellow yelper's dishes, the kalbi was pretty standard, the Korean chicken had a great kick I enjoyed that dish and the kalbi Jim (kind of like a braised short rib) was incredibly tender, if I come back here I would probably order the kalbi jim. 

The service was very friendly despite us being there so close to closing time, we were allowed to take our time and never rushed out. The restaurant was quite clean and the décor fit the theme. The menu is a mixture of Korean and Japanese, our group stuck with the Korean dishes. Overall this is a decent restaurant, I would not go out of my way to visit but if you are in the area it is a viable option."}
{"text":"Good location,  good food, cozy atmosphere and nice service.  Serves Korean and Japanese food. 

Will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is absolutely delicious. This is my go-to place for quick and tasty Korean food...the best in the city in my opinion. Everything I've eaten here so far is great. However, service can be slow during peek times but not too much of an issue."}
{"text":"Ate there on a recent business trip to Toronto and we loved it. 

My noodle soup with beef ribs was excellent, as was the kim chee that came with it.

Service was also spot on."}
{"text":"Cute little place on Yonge that serves a mix of Japanese and Korean favorites. I ordered the beef jap chae bap: a GIANT serving of jap chae (a sweet-ish dish made with cellophane noodles, soy sauce, veggies and bulgogi) and white rice. The noodles were nice and chewy, and there was plenty of shiitake mushrooms and beef to make it especially hearty. And a decent deal at $11.95, considering I had plenty leftover to take home for a midnight snack. :) 

On the other hand, the Red Dragon Roll was just okay - it was strangely warm, which made me a little nervous. The warmth was probably from the tempura in the center of the roll, but there wasn't any coolness coming from the raw salmon on top. Eee. 

I think next time I come here, I'm going to stick with the Korean stuff; it seems their strong suit."}
{"text":"Don't like the food here. I expected a lot more for such a nice looking restaurant, but it's really not that great... The sushi is poorly made and huge (one bite? Nope). Some of the food my friend and I ordered were basically noodles tossed in some sauce. My friend's tofu spicy soup was a bunch of oil and sauce mixed with water and tofu...  Didn't meet our expectations. I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"At first glance, this place looks clean and nice without the steep prices that you may expect from a fancy restaurant. 

It was pretty quiet around 10pm on a monday, but there was still ppl there but you can expect to get seated right away.

I ordered a spicy pork hot pot, it was delicious but its not what you'd expect when you hear hotpot.  This was more like a sizzling hot pot but be careful as the pot and food is hot.

I always love how the korean does the spicy pork. Always tender, full of flavour and easy to eat. Cant go wrong with spicy pork."}
{"text":"I'm normally a bit wary of restaurants that have more than one style of cuisine, but I was in the area looking for a bento box, and they had photos with 24 different lunch specials posted by the door, including a nigiri chicken teriyaki bento box, so I decided to pop in and was seated right away. 

It is a nice clean restaurant, not too loud, and it wasn't overly packed for the weekday lunchtime rush. There were several solo diners like myself so that was kind of nice. The lunch specials are only available on weekdays (I believe it was 11-3) and there is a bit of something for everyone - some Korean dishes, some Japanese, some Chinese-style, and some mixed dishes. I believe the owners were Korean (I did not recognize the language as either Chinese or Japanese).

I was able to order my bento box right away, and my complimentary miso soup arrived a minute later. I would say that my bento box came out about 5 minutes later - it was very, very quick. There was japchae in the corner (I rarely eat this so I enjoyed it a lot), a tangy soy-ginger dressing salad, tempura yam maki, the chicken teriyaki on a bed of stir-fried shredded cabbage and carrots (likely a boneless thigh, a tiny bit dry at the edges and on the salty side but still tasty - the veggies were a good accompaniment), and five pieces of nigiri (rice was a bit mushy but I liked the assortment). I liked that there was a healthy dollop of wasabi with the box.

Service was fast and excellent - my water was filled regularly and they were attentive to my needs (for example, as soon as I'd looked up for my waitress to order, another one saw me and came to take my order). They seem to have the lunch routine down pat. The food wasn't mind-blowing but it was definitely better than average, and a good deal. I did randomly have heartburn right after eating (I rarely get heartburn; usually only when eating hotpot) but that wouldn't discourage me from coming back again. Oh, they accept Visa :)"}
{"text":"This place is great for Korean food but mediocre at best for Japanese food. Their spicy Korean soup was so good but when I had their sushi and sashimi combo it wasn't that great I wished I went somewhere else. Stick to the Korean stuff!"}
{"text":"My first experience here was good, nothing amazing but just regular sushi- not too bad.
My second time we ordered couple of dishes from which some were very, very dry. And the Crunch California roll was almost rock hard and too oily. I had this roll before in another place and it was delicious. Not sure what happened."}
{"text":"Great little place! Perfect location (steps from Panasonic Theatre on Yonge Street near Yorkville, surrounded by a great variety of shops), ambience is cozy and relaxing, and the service is welcoming and upbeat.  I discovered this the night I went to see Arrabal.  Hassle-free, fun, and most importantly, the food was excellent and ready promptly.  

I tried Oja's Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box ($12), which included shrimp & yam tempura, glass noodles, California rolls, steamed rice, miso soup, salad - and a slew of Korean appetizers!  Radish, beans, kimchi.  The tempura especially was to die for. Melt in your mouth light, fluffy batter, bursts of fab flavour, generous size.  Such a varied and excellent quality meal.  

My friend and I sat by the window, watching life on Yonge Street float by in our happy bubble. I highly recommend popping into this pretty spot - perfect downtown Toronto experience. :)"}
{"text":"Never disappointed when I am here, the food is so authentic and the taste is amazing! This is a spot to go when you're craving for sushi and Korean food. I always order the rolls and am always satisfied with their presentation and the effort they put into making the food!"}
{"text":"I don't think it's called a Noodle House anymore as the outside says Korean & Japanese cuisine.

I went on a cold Thursday night with my friend hoping to have some nice hot Korean stew and decided to try this place out instead of Miss Korea next door because there were more people inside. I don't know if it was the best decision though.

There was a good variety of food on the menu with decent prices so I decided to get the Kimchi Chigae (stew), my friend got the Silken Tofu Seafood? Soup with two sets of three side dishes of pickled radishes, I think fermented soy nuts and kimichi and additionally we shared a Dynamite Roll. It came around to $28 without tip or tax so it was alright. 

So first of all the waitress did not get my order. She only wrote down my friend's order and our Dynamite Roll. Probably some miscommunication there with English, I understand. But I ended up getting the same dish as my friend so.. yeah. Enough said. But anyways I enjoyed the Dynamite Roll as the tempura was very crunchy and warm and the cucumber was crisp and cold so I liked that combination.

Anyways, their Silken Tofu Maybe Seafood Soup was quite spicy. And I usually do like spice but I felt like it didn't have much flavour other than salty. Felt very thirsty afterwards. I think it was supposed to be seafood as well but I got one dinky mussel so that was about as much seafood as I got.

I also had to pay for tea. It was only $1 but I'm used to not having to pay for my tea so that wasn't really cool for me. 

I don't know if I would go back but I guess I would try more sushi options if I do."}
{"text":"Not sure why this is called a noodle house but they didn't serve much noodles. Typical Korean food with some sushi and maki on their menu. We came as a group of six. Since they didn't have a table, they had asked for a couple to move to make one for us. I'm sure the couple wasn't happy about it. Place was plain. Ordered the karaagi and jap chae. Both dish made me question if they really are Korean. The chicken didn't seem to be seasoned other than the flour they used. For the price, the portion was minimal. The jap chae had a lot of soy sauce. Good thing I had a big lunch. I don't think I will ever come back here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately for me, I had take out kimchi chigae today from here. Everything was fine until I found a long black hair in my food.
To be fair I never gave them a chance to rectify the situation since it was take out.
It's too bad because the taste was fine until I got to that, but I would not order from here again."}
{"text":"My wife, kids and I used to really love eating here and have been for quite some time. However, lately we noticed that the service had really dropped off. Our last visit the waitress did not come to bring us water or take our order until we eventually called for her. They also got the food prep timing wrong as when we got our food much of it was cold. When we were done with our dishes she just left everything there until it was time to pay. I'm getting the feeling they changed management. We have decided to never go back again."}
{"text":"We had the \"green dragon\" and \"caterpillar\" 
Sushi roll plates. Both came with miso soup to start. The rolls were served quite quickly and came with wasabi and ginger slices. Presentation was quite lovely. The rolls were very tasty and the serving quite plentiful. On a down note, the beer wasn't very cold and the washrooms are up two flights of stairs and weren't the best. Neither men's nor ladies(as per my daughter) were particularly clean and neither had running water. Perhaps the cold temps had something to do with that. Nonetheless, you go for the food and the food was great."}
{"text":"Always come here for my hae dup bop cravings with reasonable pricing. They offer both Japanese and Korean items so you always have too many options! Been coming to this restaurant for years and I never leave unsatisfied. Friendly staff and clean environment."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, once on a weekday night, once on a Sunday night. I am not sure why this is called a noodle house, because I believe their Korean dishes are more famous. 

The first time I came here, I was with a group of 3. We ordered a large sushi combo to share and a small hot sake. The food came fairly fast, though there was only 1 other table. The sushi was quite fresh. The sake was very good as well. 

The 2nd time I came here was with a group of 6. We ordered separate meals, ranging from teriyaki chicken, to bulgogi, to kimchi soup. The food came pretty quick from what I remember. The Japanese meals come with rice, miso soup and salad, while the Korean meals come with rice and side dishes - beans, radishes, and kimchi. The bulgogi and teriyaki chicken came in a fairly large portion, but only a small rice bowl was given. I believe they do let refills for side dishes and rice, but I am not sure if you have to pay. I had the kimchi soup, and it was very good. It was not too spicy (I personally can't handle spicy), and had good flavour. 

In terms of aesthetics, the lighting is a little dim towards the back of the restaurant, but there are window seats near the door. The place is nicely decorated and they have matching furniture. 

The food is fairly priced here, most meals are 8-12 dollars. If you share a sushi combo, it can come down to even cheaper. 

The service was great both times I went there.

If you're near Bloor/Yonge and enjoy eating Korean and Japanese food, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here a few times now. The food is fairly good, but this time I found 2 hairs in my soup-I had to pull one out of my mouth-so that's lowered my opinion of the place a bit. Pretty grossed out."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this restaurant on couple of occasions but last time was very disappointing.
We ordered Eel Unagi roll and Chicken Teriyaki roll and they were both extremely dry. I mean so dry that I could barely eat them. I think it was one of the driest sushi ever, maybe they should add some sauce or something.
Our Miso soups were good but I wish they added a piece of tofu or seaweed in it.
And then we had Crunch Roll that is just regular California roll but fried. I think it was very hard, way too crunchy and oily (maybe over fried?) and the taste was gone. Actually the crab in it was very soft and mushy, did not enjoy it at all.
I guess I will still come back for their lunch specials but won't try new dishes."}
{"text":"Lets start with: i'm a little bit of a germaphobe....Service was okay when we first arrived. Then I found a bug in the noodles... I brought this up to the waiter who brought it back and then proceeded to take it out. She then came out with something on a piece of paper saying it was just seaweed. Until I brought out a picture that I took before hand of it she did not offer an apology. The manager/boss came out to see the picture and left after a very short examining/trying to take my phone from my hand. I was offered an apology And didn't have to pay for the meal after I told then I felt they were accusing me of accusing them. I was very unhappy the decor was very nice, I wanted to enjoy it but I didn't. I didn't even get to finish a quarter of my meal before I found that THING! Picture is up for proof"}
{"text":"Good for both Korean and Chinese food. Me and my friend came here. I had Sushi box and spicy chicken hot pot. An assortment of sushi was delivered but I liked the Salmon. Spicy chicken was a bit to spicy for my friends liking"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in for lunch before going to see a show at the Panasonic Theatre.  I was still satiated from Mother's Day breakfast, so I only ordered chicken karage and a miso soup.  Neither one was outstanding, but I split a plate of Hawaiian maki with my friend and those were so good.  My friend had bulgogi and she enjoyed it very much.  The service was good and so were the prices.  I would return, for sure!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came here after a tennis game at rosedale feeling really hungry. The fried dumplings and Korean soup I got was tasty. Service was a bit slow. Again, it is really really cheap. I paid for two and it was 35 dollars."}
{"text":"I got some of the most sincere service I've had in a while at Oja during lunch the other day. The dainty server with the massive smile must have asked me how my food was no less than five times over the course of my meal. 

The many options of lunch specials (featured at the store front that initially lured me inside) looked great, but were not offered on weekends. My default chirashi ($11.95) although nicely arranged, was actually quite sparse when the decorative parsley and lemon wedges were removed. Regardless, the fish was fresh and the rice nicely seasoned. However, nothing else really mattered once I was presented with a \"nanosilver sterilization spoon\". Wrapped in what I am assuming is nanosilver sterilizing paper, the metal spoon seemed so sterile I didn't even want to disturb it's packaging. I have to admit I was definitely amused.

The entirely red interior features a single wall of cute dishes in various sizes mounted onto it. The decorative pieces on the ceiling are reminiscent of the lids of miniature coffins. You really have to see this to understand what I mean. I'm guessing that heading over on a weekday to try one of the many delicious looking lunch specials is probably your best bet."}
{"text":"I got sushi at place called Noodle House and I survived to talk about it.

Ordered the California and Spicy Salmon Roll combo ($8.95) which came with a miso soup.  Impressive selection of lunch specials at decent prices so I would be tempted to come back again and try something else.

Sushi was fine, nothing out of the ordinary.  Service was also okay. 

Another lunch option in my work 'hood added to my list!"}
{"text":"One of my friends started working by Bloor station and I met up with her for lunch. We decided to try out Oja nearby, a Korean and Japanese restaurant with plenty of options. I was surprised with how cheap everything was! I got the Tempura Bento box and it was incredibly filling. Mainly because I had to finish everything less than an hour. It may not look much but if you have limited time to eat, you will get bloated fast!

I will definitely come back here again for a cheap lunch. There are a lot of options and it's at a good location."}
{"text":"Service is polite.
I have strong digestion, and the food was so so for me.
However, my friend was sick overnight after."}
{"text":"Agreed with Jennifer M, this place doesn't do sushi particularly well (sloppy rolls!) but overall it's a good spot for lunch. They have a large lunch menu with an impressive selection of bento boxes and specialty rolls, most items ranging from $8-$12. Their regular menu has both Korean dishes and sushi.

Their Korean food is quite good, I had the kimchichiggae (kimchi stew with pork and tofu) which was tasty. At $9, it's a couple bucks more pricey than Korea town places, but still reasonable.

The staff here was very, very friendly. 

Not a lot of seating in here and we saw people turned away who showed up for a late lunch."}
{"text":"Bibimbap isn't as good as Miss Korea (next store) but at least you can have a a seat with a back to enjoy your meal =p ok, to be fair the real reason is the split Korean / Japanese options on the menu.  Unmm bibimbap or bento box ?! You can always count for an open table without a reso (not sure if hey even take or need one). Pricing is certainly reasonable for Yonge/Bloor. If you are not looking to drink yourself silly with louder ambiance and Korean Moxie alike waitress then Oja is your place! It's definitely a mom and pop shop!

Highlight of the visit:
Ordered two big Korean dishes but the sushi roll came 10 mins after the Korean ones :)

{"text":"Located on Yonge just south of Bloor, Oja is a hotspot for good quality Korean and Japanese dishes. Although somewhat small, seating was adequate and the atmosphere was cozy. We ordered cold noodles w/ spicy sauce (their summer special) along with korean style spicy chicken. The chicken was tender, the hot sauce was hot, and the noodles were one of the best I've had in a while. While the price was on the higher side and service was slower than expected, I would not hesitate to visit again if I'm in the area. Would I travel to the core of Toronto to grab a bite there? Probably not."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here, love the hwae dup bap although it's gotten VERY expensive (17?!), the yuk gae Jang and the samsun jampong.  The owner and his wife are lovely and the food is consistently good :) I do wish they didn't charge for green tea though..."}
{"text":"Oja Noodles House  might not be the best choice for Japanese and Korean food or even for noodle but on a weekday late night there are not too many choices around the area.

The waitress that greet us was friendly and cheerful even it was almost closing time. Our group of 7 took a little while to decide on what to order and our request of separate bills was satisfied without hesitation! +0.5 star

I tried the Kalbitang ($12.99) and Jjampong ($9.99) which was not the best but I was kind of hungry so having food in my stomach was really comforting. 

The lighting is great: dim and just enough to see my food... I feel good to come here after a few drinks at the Elite event... dark and soothing..................."}
{"text":"Felt like Sushi on Sunday so ventured over to Nijo but it was closed. Decided to walk to Yonge street and thought to try a new place. Should have went to Wow Sushi. 

We ordered a sashimi set and a sushi/sashimi set. The fish had an old smell to it and it didn't taste very good. The spicy salmon rolls had a days old taste to them. The rice that was served with the Sashimi was old, hard and even a bit yellow. 

Will absolutely never go back again and wouldn't recommend. Oh and the portions relative to others in the area like Nijo are about half the size. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Pretty standard. Had the Kimchi Chigae and a drink and it totalled under $12. 

The food was pretty average. The washrooms were a little bizarre, and might be completely inaccessible for some people, with a low sloping ceiling and a trek to be made up some very narrow, creaky stairs. The service, however, was top-notch. Friendly, helpful, and smiling. And I never felt rushed."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi place. My go to restaurant when I'm craving sushi! Nice atmosphere and friendly servers! Love their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Enjoyable Pan-Asian joint near Bloor and Yonge. Showed up at noon and we were seated promptly and courteously. Their lunch menu offers lots of specials: sashimi, bento boxes, rolls, and noodles. My shanghai noodles were excellent, but my date regretted the lemon chicken she ordered. Service was top-notch and prices seemed reasonable.

Obligatory Title Pun: OJA Horses! (Terrible, I know.)

Menu Readability: The lunch menu featured pictures of everything, which I like.

Need to mention: A good pick for lunch if you work in the area. Not rammed like the overrated Spring Rolls next door.

What this place teaches me about myself: Not every restaurant title is o-pun to humourous modification."}
{"text":"Huge portion of galbi at $12.  Pretty slow service for lunch.  Huge huge portion... enough for lunch and dinner tomorrow.

Really nice waitress.  

Bento boxes for under $10 (bulgogi and jap chae).  Close to work so I'll be back."}
{"text":"Worst Korean restaurant ever. I ordered chicken terriyaki and I found a long hair. Not only that, there was a problem with the employers' attitude as well. The place seemed quite busy because there was only one server, and she got yelled by the employers in front of the customers because of her subtle mistake. I felt uncomfortable and bad for her. I would never go to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service, reasonable prices and delicious food.  Simply what a restaurant should be. Great job I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Ordered a beef udon soup and got a chicken broth with like 4 pieces of beef in it. Mostly fat. No flavour and no substance to it at all. At least put some shimeji mushrooms in it. Shiitake at least. Like, come on. Won't be back."}
{"text":"The waitresses were nice!!! I'm so glad :)! happy to eat there!

We thought this was a Korean restaurant at first... so my friend and I decided to go there. But we were actually standing behind the light post and it covered the world \"Japanese.\" We didn't realize our mistake til we saw their name on the menu.

So it's a Korean AND JAPANESE restaurant, which is super weird for me.... kind of like saying, Canadian AND American food. 

I ordered the OJA Udon and my friend got the Kalbi. According to the menu that I saw, LAST WEEK.... both our dishes cost the same, $9.95. On their website, OJA Udon says $8.85. It went up by $1! 

It was really good :) busyish place in the afternoon, it was a Sunday for us. I like the place! Nice place. Nice people. Also, I loved seeing my friend thus that day was awesome, which automatically made my impression of OJA good."}
{"text":"On a quest for some Asian Fare for an after work early dinner I stumbled upon Oja, took a look inside and seemed promising with a few customers already seated.

A friendly waitress greets us upon entering and tells us to choose our seats, we pick a spacious wooden booth near the entrance. She later returns with menus and takes our drink orders.

Green Tea - Arrives in cute mugs with a generic tea bag inside, mild flavour.

The menu has lots of options and includes plenty of pictures which is helpful when ordering.

For appetizer we order the Dumplings - 5 deep fried golden brown dumplings come out piping hot. Average tasting but good.
 (FYI don't order these if your getting a bento box b/c it comes with 2)

Next comes out the Salad and Miso soup - Loved the salad, very flavourful dressing the miso was also pretty good.

Then arrives the Bento Boxes - wowieee I was not expecting this much food in my bento box, the boxes come standard with a hefty portion of tempura vegetables and shrimp both perfectly crispy and delicious, cold noodle salad, 2 dumplings, choice of rice or california rolls plus your choice of meat....a lot of food!

Spicy Chicken with California rolls Bento Box - The spicy chicken was indeed super spicy, chicken cooked perfectly with lots of meat.

Bulgogi Bento Box w/rice - Beef tender not dry and flavourful

Finally to round out the meal we decided to get dessert
Green Tea ice cream - two small scoops which I'm glad are small because its the perfect size to satisfy your sweet tooth

Overall food came out fast, hot, and plentiful! Service was great and portions are huge and prices are affordable, just stick with the bento boxes and get the leftovers to go!"}
