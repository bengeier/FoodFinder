{"text":"No reviews are needed for Panama West Island (if you have been to the one on Jean Talon you'll know why) and that is why I forgot to write one. Best Greek food in the West Island. We have been frequenting this place for several years. The food is exceptionally good.........(this is not Casa Grec, Porte Grec or Marathon type food), the portions are big, this is great for families. You must try the full chicken, a salad with Greek feta, oven baked potatoes, grilled octopus, lamb roast (only Thur & Fri), lamb chops, grilled mushrooms, fish.......I could go on.  Go and be the judge. Great service every time."}
{"text":"Was there with a party of 8, 4adults 4kids nice atmosphere and clean from the entrance to the washrooms. Food was average for the price although the salad they include with the meal was awful soggy oil drenched lettuce, the worst part was the souvlaki plate (at a Greek restaurant). The meat was dry and burnt the pita was overfilled with tzatziki, the tomatoes in the pita were cut in huge quarters like in a Greek salad, lazy lazy . The lamb chops were tasty but again overcooked, the rib steak was worth the price but again overcooked not to or request. Certainly a rotisserie can get one meat cooked to request. As for the rest of the appetizers the spinach pie was great, the fried zucchini and eggplant was tasteless, not impressed for a place I heard so much about. I would be weary of giving this place another chance, but because I've heard many recommendations I probably will, maybe on a slower night."}
{"text":"Great food, simple, fresh, flavoured and very well prepared. Great staff!! Very pleased to have discovered this place."}
{"text":"Always wanted to go and eat here and finally had the opportunity last week.  We went for lunch and the service was very quick.  We were able to finish up before our lunch hour was over.  Had the pork brochette which was grilled to perfection. Their potatoes were also very good.  My salad was fresh but a bit bland and too vinagry.   Lunch was 12.95 which was good."}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place on a weeknight and it was almost empty. Menu is fairly simple with your standard Greek fare, prices are a little high. Not much choice on the wine list and this where they gouge you (over 2.5x SAQ). Greek salad was good with plenty of feta, spanakopita was tasty although a little oily. Calamari was awful, rubber-band like with some pieces clearly freezer burnt and inedible. Ordered two chicken brochettes (no rice or anything else) and was charged $18r. Tzatziki was above average. On the whole not a bad place, service was friendly and we were not kept waiting for anything."}
{"text":"My gf and I went here for a friend's birthday. The restaurant decor is nothing special. The food was good and the service was decent. We had a waitress that was a little too friendly and involved which made things uncomfortable. We also felt pressure to order an entree which we didn't order. My gf and I had the salmon which was cooked well. It came with a side of potatoes and rice which were also good. I would've preferred veggies and rice or potatoes rather than 2 different starches. It's pricey for this location since it's located in a strip mall. It wasn't bad but it's not a restaurant that I'd return any time soon."}
{"text":"Nice family Greek restarant. We ordered the 1/2 lb Grilled Lamb plate (Fri/ Sat only), grilled whole chicken, grilled whole sea bass,  greek salad, fried calamari, rice, potatoes, half fried eggplant half fried zuchinni.  Everything was for sharing. The food was good. The grilled meat was good, but did not have alot of flavour.  The lamb was a bit on the salty side."}
{"text":"Panama was on our 'must' list for this year so when we had a birthday party to celebrate we zeroed in on the D.D.O. location. Our charming server suggested since we were a party that we order multiple dishes sharing amongst is what we did. When it was mentioned the calamari does not come with a dipping sauce, just lemon wedges, a dinner mate actually saw my face wince however I was pleased with the fresh, crispy texture of the batter, not once did I detect 'freezer burn' as mentioned in other reviews. Next up were the fried zucchini and eggplant...absolutely delicious with just enough bite remained (note to readers, I am not a fan of the latter veggies, but Panama will be the ONLY time I will eat them).

Since it was a Saturday night we ordered the roast lamb. This dish obviously had a lot of TLC, a rich home style taste of the melt-in-your-mouth texture. That dish went the fastest, a small portion for what you pay.

My face winced again when we were told the chicken is roasted with the skin removed. Once again I was proved wrong with every piece was tender, juicy and wonderful charred flavour. Plenty of greek style potatoes filled our dishes, very tasty indeed.

Since it was a party, we were provided with complimentary loukoumades which worked out to be about 2 balls per person. The light & fluffy deep fried dough was covered in a light, sugary glaze. What was missing was our opportunity to have ordered coffee or tea to not only accompany the surprise treat but more importantly this would have been the perfect ending to our meal. More on why I suspect the reason why we did not towards the end of my review.

The only caveat I have for reservations, be wary on an early booking on Saturday. Even though the operating hours on Saturday indicate 4-11pm, considering there were young children among the guests I asked for a 5pm sitting. I was told \" No, the earliest sitting we have is 6PM, but that you must agree to be finished by 8PM as we have another sitting thereafter\". Oh? I understand restaurants want to maximise their nights, but 2 hours was strikingly pressing time. Not wanting to face the logistics of finding another place to go, I \"agreed\" to the \"conditional\" mealtime. 

Guests arrived between 5:45 and 6:15, the latter as a result of conditions beyond their control. Thankfully since every one had been briefed on ordering the food arrived with minutes. During the complimentary desert we wondered why no coffee or tea was flowing, looking at the time was now 7:50....oops I guess their message, time to go!! Better sort out and pay our bills. By the time that was done, ready to leave the time was now 8:10. Since we were seated in the part of the restaurant where the entrance was out of view, as we rose from our seats we felt a collective pang of being gypped for time as there were plenty of seats and tables vacant with plenty of other tables still had lots of people. Add more disbelief was not one person waiting to be seated. So much for the other sitting!! We left feeling like we had been spit out like a turn style."}
{"text":"Overpriced and underfed. My fianc√©e and I ate there last night and we were not impressed. We started with the calamari that was just so-so. A 1/2 liter of the house red was so young that it was foaming as it poured. Or was that soap in the carafe?
He ordered a chicken fillet platter, came with two oversized wedges of boiled potato that had rotten parts in the middle, rice, and salad. The salad (which I also tasted) was overly saturated in a very salty vinaigrette. I ordered the sea bass that was supposed to be 1 lb. at \"market price\". I expected a decent piece of fish with something else on the plate but all I got was a filleted whole fish with the head, tail and skin still intact and on my plate. Maybe this weighed 1 lb. uncooked but it was so overly grilled that all I could do was pick at some thin bits of white fish between all the bones. It was covered in capers and that might have been the only thing to give it some flavour. About half way through the waiter came by to ask how our meal was and I expressed that I was not enjoying this $29 piece of overcooked fish. To his credit he did apologize and say that he would speak to the owner. At the end of the meal when he came to take away our plates he said the owner was very sorry I didn't like it but this was the way they served it. I really think \"the owner\" could have made an effort to come to our table in person considering there were only two other occupied tables in the restaurant. I can think of a lot better places to spend a hundred dollars and I will not ever go back. Two thumbs down for us."}
{"text":"The portions are crazy huge, the service is on point and the loukumades are sweet."}
{"text":"So food is good but not worth your buck.This is a fancier restaurant with great decor but the dish I ordered was plain and expensive for what I was getting comparing to other authentic greek restaurants that im use to. My plate came with souvlaki chicken with rice greens and few potatoes.. Greens is literally just lettuce nothing else.. I had to sprinkle lemon to eat it. Rice tasted like it was warmed up in the microwave and I had to ask for tzatziki( with an extra charge) imagine! That doesnt come with the plate!! Lmao.. Ill order a pita next time.Service always very good. But it wasnt enjoyable greek that im use to."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine. Used to hit the west island location until the Laval one opened.

Service is quick and friendly.

I don't recommend ordering pitas or whatnot, did it once wasn't impressed and it's not what they are all about.

We love to go on an appetizer rampage. The tzatziki is good, greek sausages excellent. Greek salad is good. Greek potatoes are awesome. Spanakopita is tasty.... etc.

I'm getting hungry again just typing about it.

Specialty is the chicken and the lamb. I recommend sharing it with folks.

Desert favorite is the loukumades."}
{"text":"My co-workers and I always make it a point to visit this restaurant at least twice when we happen to be working in Montreal.  You can not go wrong with the grilled chicken, lamb platter and grilled octopus.  The service was pretty good considering how busy it is whenever we go there.   I could eat two lamb platters if I ever had my way, but it's great to have a group and eat family style."}
{"text":"Microscopic pieces of dry and over cooked crispy grilled chicken on brochette served with boiled savoury potatoes without any tzatziki, well seasoned salad which are all part of the platter were the highlights of our group dinner last night. Prices are overly high for the portions and quality. Chewy fried calamari served without any sauce. Average service with waitress who seemed to be upset to be working with a non exixtant smile yet expect full tip. A case can be made that there is a difference between a waiter and a plate bringer. Maybe I'm crazy but Marathon's is better any day of the week. Will not return."}
{"text":"As it was my mother's birthday I asked her what type of food she wanted to eat  \"Greek\" she said. Panama was not the first place that sprang into my mind - A) I hadn't been there yet and B) with a name like Panama greek food is not the first thing that springs to mind. So looking at the pitiful choice for greek we have here on the west island i did a yelp search and lo and behold...

We had reservations for around 6:30. Being a group of 7 we were seated along the back wall - a good spot as we were well out of the fray, because as the night went on the place became filled to the rafters literally (they have a loft area as well).

The service was friendly and our waiter was as attentive as he could be considering the number of clients he was taking care of . It did appear that they were a little short staffed but it really didn't affect the service all that much, so that speaks volumes.

To start, I ordered a Pikiia platter and it was plenty for the table. Everything on the platter was delicious 

We ordered 2 orders of sea bass which we split between 3 people with an couple orders of rice and potatoes and and house salads for all , my brother ordered the lamb platter which was delicious but not enough for a man with a big appetite, my husband had the souvlaki platter, my sister the red snapper and my daughter a greek salad. The food was delicious. My mother even sucked the life out of the fish heads! 

The cocktails (margaritas, mojitos and a dirty martini) were also really good.

The total at the end of the night was near $600 but considering we were 7 people, ordered alcohol and a bottle of wine - I'd say it was pretty reasonable. 

I'll go back for sure."}
{"text":"This is a casual good place to go for Greek food.  The breaded eggplant and zucchini was really good.  The roasted chicken is great.  Even the honey balls were hard to resist.  I would suggest reservations for a Saturday night as it was pretty busy."}
{"text":"We had the calamari and the chicken pita platter. Both were really good. Chicken was tender and the tzatziki was not too garlicky. The roasted potatoes where very nice as well. I didn't like the salad, but my friend did, I thought the dressing had a bit too much lemon. 

Great, friendly service, nice music and atmosphere, would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Delicious Greek food with an odd name. Not sure if there is a Panama in Greece or if the owner of this place is a friend or admirer of the former leader Manuel Noriega but regardless this restaurant is a nice change to Marathon the other West Island main Greek Resto. When entering the establishment you get a sense that it's a more upscale and quaint. 

Looking around to other neighbouring tables were bowls of grilled lamb and chicken plus people enjoying the Montreal special fried zuchinni (my Greek friend says they don't even do this dish in Greece). Greek restaurants are usually the types of places in which you will not go hungry. More the contrary that you will probably leave walking a bit slower and declaring that you ate too much! If you want lots of good stick to your ribs quality food this is your place! 

I had for the evening a plate of a chicken in a pita + pork skewer, Greek salad and  rice with lemon potatoes.  The chicken was good but the pork was exceptional. Greek salad was perfectly dressed with oil and vinegar plus feta. Rice was light and fluffy and the lemon potatoes were downright delicious. 

Service was quite exceptional. At Marathon the experience is like eating at a Greek Perkins (service okay not great) here they really were trained in providing a high quality dining experience. 

TV was on with the NHL playoff game which was a bit distracting but oh well! 

Price wise it's a bit more than M but quite a nice different change! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite type of food is Greek food. I have tried out a few places, marathons, souvlaki bar, muses and they are all pretty decent. I wanted to try a new one and based and on another yelpers review i came to Panama. Went in a Friday night, called in for reservations at last minute and he said he had some spots left. Went in around 6:15 only one table was occupied. The guy in the phone made it seem like they were packed, so when I saw the place almost empty it didn't sit well with me. 

To start off they brought us bread, which was good. Then we ordered a traditional greek salad and fried calmars. Greek salad was really tasty, it was fresh and the olive oil was delicious. The calmars however were not that great, rubbery and not crisp enough for me. 

As for the meal we ordered half a roasted chicken and some broiled lamb. Honestly, I am not fan of lamb, but I have to keep it real, they really did a spectacular job. It was tasty and juicy. It made me change my whole opinion about lamb. The chicken was very good too. I really like the half chicken and the souvlaki bar so If I had to compare, I would say souvlaki bar's chicken is more juicy and tasty but only because the marinated is more oily and not very healthy. Panama's chicken is grilled, very good and healthy. So basically if you want to let loose for a day and don't care about cholesterol then the chicken (only the chicken) is better at souvlaki bar. But if you want to eat out but still eat healthy, the chicken at Panama is better. Oh! I must mot forget the oven baked potatoes, soooooo gooood.

Last but not least dessert. The waiter, who was fantastic by the way, suggested bakhlava but I really wanted to loukoomades so we ordered both. Bakhlava was decent but the lookamades was amazing.

By the way mid way through our dinner the restaurant was packed, I guess the guy on the phone wasn't exaggerating."}
{"text":"Not bad. I didn't really enjoy the chicken because there were so many bones in it but everything else was delicious. The Tzatziki was tasty, the calamaries were to die for, the greek salad.... mmmmmmm... i can go on and on. I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I visit the Montreal area every few years and I love this restaurant. I've been to all three locations and have never been disappointed. The food is always excellent and the service outstanding."}
{"text":"I used to hit the west island location until the Laval one opened and in general the Laval location is notably better.

I don't recommend ordering pitas or whatnot like other yelpers have. I did it once wasn't impressed and it's not what they are all about. If you visit this resto I recommend their specialty which is the chicken or the lamb. I recommend sharing it with folks as it feeds 2 to 4 mouths.

We love to go on an appetizer rampage however.

During this visit my review was : 

- The tzatziki was really good,
- The Greek sausages were decent but felt off.
- The Greek potatoes were good
- The saganaki was extremely good and quite tasty.

My favorite desert favorite is the loukumades. (honey doughnut balls)

The service is generally quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Rotisserie Panama came highly recommended to me from some friends who live nearby and come hear often.  It's a casual restaurant serving up Greek fare in the West Island.  I can't comment on the weekend crowds but if you come on a week night it won't be too crazy so a reservation probably isn't necessary.  We were three and we got seated right away.

We were told that the chicken was what we needed to try so that was what we went for.  If you go for the full chicken it's huge so it can easily be split among three or four people.  The recommendation was spot on as it was juicy and well seasoned.  We combined that with a platter of appetizers that included foods like spanakopita, tzatziki, garlic mashed potato and so on.  We also got an order of saganaki which was very crispy and overall very good.  It was good but it was heavy on the garlic. If you're here for a date it might not be your best option.  I had a slice of Ferrero Rocher cheesecake for dessert and that was the lowpoint of the meal.  It was dry and just not very good. The chocolate wafer crust had also been way overcooked.  Next time I would give the traditional Greek desserts a shot.

Pricewise it was fairly reasonable.  I was plenty full by the end of the meal and I enjoyed it too.  The service was quick and reasonably friendly.  It's definitely being added to the list of restaurants in the West Island to hit up when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Its been a while I have been to Panama to eat and actually my first time in laval.  We started with the entrees, Octopus was very good and tender but small for $17....Greek salad was good. I esp. liked the feta. Greek oil could have beena little better but still a good salad. Fried Calamari was not to my liking. I have had better and stuck to only one piece. From here it only got better. We had the lamp chops, Red snapper and Chicken. All were excellent as in Montreal. 
Service was good, maybe to over done. He seemed to love his job. 
Only think is the price seemed very expensive.  When you pay $250 for 4 kids and 2 adults with no wine....thats steep. 
I had something similar in Astoria, NY for half the price. Tripoli is just as good and much cheaper."}
{"text":"We originally would have gone to Marathon's but since they're still closed for renovations, we decided to try this place out (that and we reallllly wanted Greek food). The reviews online were decent, so we decided to give it a whirl. When we arrived, staff greeted us nicely and we were promptly seated; decor is very tasteful and classy, compared to other Greek restaurants I've been to. I ordered the chicken souvlaki pita, and it came with rice, house salad and potatoes (I opted to switch them to fries). I wouldn't call the service fast or slow, considering we were a large group, it was decent. I must say, I was happy/relieved I switch my potato for fries, because their house specialty potatoes were doused in what tasted like lemon juice and a pound of salt. The fries were alright, nothing too exciting. The rice and salad were pretty oily and a bit bland, but still edible. The chicken souvlaki pita seemed to be lacking in the chicken department; I must've gotten the scrawniest souvlaki stick because there wasn't much meat in that thing. Normally after a Greek meal, I'm pretty stuffed, but I went home still a bit hungry. It was a little disappointing, considering their prices are higher than the average Greek joint (i.e. Arahova's or Marathon's), I don't think we'll be going back."}
