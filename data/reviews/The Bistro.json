{"text":"This has been my favorite place in Boulder for years, but the quality and service has been slipping lately.  I picked up a call in order Friday and while I was waiting watched a lady sitting down from me at the bar send her food back, and watched the cook identify the cause as bad cream. The salmon was not quite right, and our dinner overall was a bit off.  I have had really great meals here, but the last few times didn't really measure up to what I would do at home.  Please implement better quality management so that we can have at least one fine dining place in Boulder."}
{"text":"Visiting from Az. 1st. time there. Quality of food was excellent. Had a chicken dish, tender and flavorful. Great service. Will return next time in town."}
{"text":"Used to love the Bistro.  Then I had lunch there.  The Philly Cheese Steak was repugnant.  I've eaten Philly-style steak sandwiches for 50 years.  I grew up summers in the the Philadelphia area.  The tough, overcooked, thick sliced meat on garlic bread was truly offensive.  I'm a long term customer who will not be back.  I'm glad there are lots of Capriottis around."}
{"text":"Okay...locally, this is a 5-star restaurant.  (It might have to work a little harder for that fifth star in the big city vs. major, upscale establishments...so that's why only four stars here.)  THEN, it is under new ownership.  Bryce, the server rated so highly in other reviews, is the new owner.  We have not seen any of the staff being obnoxious and we have it on pretty good authority that they all use the indoor restroom facilities when such facilities are needed.  As previously mentioned the food is to die for...the steaks, chicken and fish dishes and linguini with clam sauce are wonderful.  The service is great.  It is NOT a fast food place and it IS popular.  Reservations are a good idea and take the time to enjoy the whole thing."}
{"text":"Just had dinner with my family and it was a very fine dining experience. I had the special pork chop wit spinach and feta, delicious.  The staff was incredibly nice. I will definitely be coming back again. Absolutely love the vibe and atmosphere."}
{"text":"This was a small and romantic restaurant. Service was nice and food was pretty good. Most likely one of the best restaurants in Boulder City."}
{"text":"It was alittle loud  because of its small size.  The service is always great. The bread is hot fresh & so good. My veal was good but marinara was not so good needs more flavor desserts are super we will come back"}
{"text":"So glad we came back to Bistro, it was just as good as ever.  Had a delicious dinner at a very reasonable price. Thank Bryce!!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for years. They have the best twice baked potato. The steak is amazing and the fresh bread with there seasonings on them all warm is to die for. This place has great food and good prices. The reason it is not a 5 star is because the service is always painfully slow. If I am in a hurry I will not eat here. The staff is friendly and nice and I know its because they are busy but i feel like if you are consistently busy certain nights perhaps you should staff more."}
{"text":"I asked to come to this restaurant as we had dined here previously with our neighbors so what better place for a romantic Birthday with my honey. He had made the reservation and advised it was my birthday which he did as a surprise to me.  The surprise was they forgot, some 50th birthday celebration that was. As we got up to leave they pulled my partner back in to apologize.  Too late then when I had already left. The food was really tasteful and arrived promptly, but the experience is not just the food, it is the whole evening. I am crossing this off my list of favorite places."}
{"text":"Holy cow!  Don't miss this culinary experience. It's small, set back in the street and you may overlook Bistro but don't. Park and get your ass in there!  Laurel greets you with grace and knows her menu and gives great suggestions (and even makes great salads).  Patrick is the \"artist in the kitchen\" and his skills way beyond our expectations!  The flavors burst with artichoke, mushroom, garlic, tomato and compels you to keep eating even when your full!  Great reasonable prices and suburb service.  Don't miss this gem!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Restraunt in Boulder City. Small but charming so make sure to make a reservation. Don't  pass up the twice baked potato - by far the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous! We loved the small setting and open kitchen. Don't go here if you like chain restaurants or are most focused on speed. Terrific food done with care. They even made us an special appetizer that wasn't on the menu because we asked. We loved The Bistro!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had great meals, both linguini and clams, different sauces. Nice service. Small with open kitchen. Pleasant surprise on main highway near Hoover Dam."}
{"text":"Great menu. Great service. The food was really really good. I've had the almond-crusted salmon and the pasta with spicy sauce. Excellent preparation on both. Really good Caesar salad. Even the bread is awesome and is served with oil and vinegar and herbs! A hidden gem in Boulder City."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise! Being a vegetarian visiting from out of town, it's been hard to find anything to eat around here. I got the vegetarian wrap and the quinoa salad side, which was so good that I ordered a second helping to-go. Our server Kaitlyn was also very attentive and pleasant. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Had reservations for 6:30 on a Friday night.  Not real busy but the restaurant is small and understaffed.  Waited 10 minutes at the door while they cleaned an empty table.  Got water and menus and it was 15 minutes before we were acknowledged again. The people seated after us were done and paying by the time we got our entrees.  Wait staff was not to be found. On the positive side, the food was awesome and the price was right.  2 hours for dinner and horrible service is the reason for a 3... otherwise, it would have been a 5!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Owner Bryce Hansen, Chef Patrick and the entire Bistro crew knock it out of the park every single time! Simply the most amazing pastas, artistically prepared in every style imaginable: Arrabiata, Bolognese, Pomodoro, Marinara and more...all made-from-scratch secret sauces, deliciously moist and packed with flavor.  Cajun salmon, Shrimp Pomodoro, Steamed Clams and the absolute best steak filets on the planet. Everything consistently prepared and delivered from the decks of a unique, open-style kitchen with friendly, attentive service and warm, bistro ambiance. The twice-baked potato and rice pilaf are heavenly. Phenomenal house salad and toasty, fresh-baked baguettes worth a visit on their own.  And the new lunch menu rocks! If you haven't tried The Bistro you're in for a real treat...if you have, you already know;))"}
{"text":"Stopped in because it was the only non fast food restaurant in the vicinity.   Boy were we glad we did wonderful bread salad and salmon.  Great service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Favorite place in Boulder City.  Love the martini's.  Food Fantastic!  Always have a great variety of specials to choose from.  I had Chicken Piccata and others in our party had Filet, Fish, Salad and not a complaint from anyone.  Fantastic meal. Small place so Reservations are definitely recommended."}
{"text":"This should be zero stars. Well the food was good until... We left Le Bistro and caught the owner urinating out in the side parking lot. He was shocked, embarrassed, he laughed and then ran inside to get away from us. Now my wife and I are disgusted with the whole place. I know Kevin was shocked also due to the fact he just spoke to us so he knows we were just inside eating his food. Yuck. What a bad day."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for several years when we travel north from Arizona.  It is a great little restaurant. They have not dropped the ball even with an ownership change. Food is excellent.  Service is a little slow when they are busy, otherwise fine.  We wish them well and will return on our next trip."}
{"text":"I would have to say this is not only one of my favorite places to go have a great, fresh, and authentic made meal but also have a drink after a long day! They offer both great meals that always so fresh & right from the kitchen to your table but they make some delicious drinks as well! The restaurant has such a unique layout with the open kitchen which makes it a very nice place to sit & eat. The customer service is always great, Bryce the owner doesn't just own the restaurant but he is also the one who will take your order, make you one amazing drink, & wait your table!! It makes your experience there very nice to see how much pride everyone puts into their work!"}
{"text":"Tried to make reservations but their automated system wasn't working right and when we showed up they didn't have our reservations. We were able to get at a  table but the flies would not leave us alone! Bread was good and wine was nice. It wasn't crowded, but they brought out the wrong meal to my husband. He thoroughly enjoyed his meal. I ordered pasta with basil, garlic and tomatoes yet it was so spicy I had to send it back. By the time they even came to check on us,  my husband was more than halfway done with his meal. She said she  didn't know why it's spicy and wasn't too eager to offer me something else. At that point my husband would have been done with his meal anyway. Romantic dinner date ruined by their poor service, flies, and spicy food (not mentioned on menu.)"}
{"text":"This place is so lucky it redeemed itself with fantastic food, because the notes I was taking weren't so hot. This really is a prime example for Kitchen Nightmares.   First, the hostess made the mistake of making us stand by the door for 15 minutes after scoffing that we didn't have reservations. She literally acted like she hoped we would just leave. Finally she said, \"well I can sit you at the bar if you want\". Then another 10 minutes to get us menus.  Let's just say, sitting at the bar gave us the extreme look into the kitchen and all it's awfulness. Without seeing \"behind the scenes\" I might have felt more favorable about the restaurant in general.  First of all, they had three waitstaff, except there was a guy doing drinks and the blonde lady who was taking orders. Then you have this 15 year old girl (approx.) running around serving all the tables, making all of the salads from scratch, cooking the bread, delivering the bread, fetching refills on drinks, gathering the dirty dishes and bringing them out back and even doing prep work for the cooks. The poor girl was running around like a chicken with her head cut off and didn't even have a frown about it. Nobody else on the staff even cracked a smile, never mind even talked to each other.  I also have to give props to the chef who was very attentive and made sure everyone liked their food. When he made a steak, he made sure it was cooked exactly how they wanted it and refired when necessary. And the food was amazing, so he's got it going on.  Unfortunately, there were a few things.   First, the salad bowls are inches from the ground, on the bottom shelf of the prep table. When the girl made a salad, she was pulling it up from the bottom shelf to use the bowl to mix the salad in. Too close to the floor for my taste. Also, all the salads besides Caesar have MOUNDS of Olives in them, so make sure to ask for no olives if you don't like them.  Also, the lettuce bin is in the drink station, located an inch from the handwashing station. It would be a miracle if spilled drinks and soap didn't get into the lettuce.  They also use frozen fish. I don't eat fish, but I'm sure people care about this.  HOWEVER, in terms of our food... it was fantastic. I got the Rigatoni Arriabata and it was probably the best I've ever tasted. It's very spicy, but that's just how I like it. My boyfriend got a steak and it was seasoned well and cooked perfectly.  Honestly, the chef and the young girl pretty much ran the restaurant themselves. The blonde just walked around aimlessly and I have no idea what I guy was doing besides giving more dishes to the young girl to bring out back. Maybe he was waiting tables, but I only ever saw him making drinks.  Like I said.. GREAT food but a prime candidate for Kitchen Nightmares. Also, I recommend the Caesar Salad. I didn't get it, but the garden salad was full of chopped olives and terrible."}
{"text":"I was visiting mom again this time with my brother who enjoys a good steak, my mom of course had to take 'the boys' out for that steak.   The suggestions were Tony Romas or Le Bistro for me it was Bistro all the way until my brother suggested \"Outback\" ????? I convinced him a Bistro New York strip would best anything Outback could ever dream of serving.  So Bistro it was and five star satisfaction it was again"}
{"text":"5 Star restaurant for these reasons, the food is always exceptional, the atmosphere/ ambiance is romantic- I dig a place I can come dressed or not and be comfortable, the service is personable and second to none. Its environment is romantic for special date or even just a quick night out for some great food."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall, actually almost too small to feel comfortable.... Service is ok, food is good. A little pricey for such a small place with an open kitchen. Been here during the summer and was seated close to the cooks and was pouring sweat. Not cool. Been here a few times by invite of friends."}
{"text":"To the locals or frequent customers this place is like \"Cheers\" everybody knows your name and the atmosphere is super cozy.  Overall though, this place is exceptional!  From the service (have Bryce wait on you) to the food, I couldn't ask for anything more.  It is very quaint, only 10 tables inside and 4 outside which makes the service very friendly and personable.  I have never had a bad experience there and would recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Don't just take my word for it, go try it out yourself!"}
{"text":"I'd give it less stars but I can't. Apparently a reservation for 7:30 means you can't get in until 9. When we asked when we'd be seated we were told we can eat somewhere else if we weren't content sitting outside in the cold for another hour or more."}
{"text":"I have been going here for 6 years. The food is wonderful and the service is always great. On our last visit the service was a little slow, but that worked out fine because we had more time to visit with our friends."}
{"text":"cute little spot  easy to find off the freeway.  Always clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, young server was cheerful and efficient. A bit pricey and either the proprietor changed his specs or his vendor is lying to him. Supposed \"prime grade\" ribeye was quite poor/disappointing.  I have been in the meat industry forever and this was not a prime cut. Ribeye is fatty anyway and there was no marbling at all.  Probably will not recommend or go back."}
{"text":"This was out first visit. We went on a Monday night. We are wine people. They had a \"baby Amarone\" on the specials board. I asked the waitress, what this was. She had no idea. She brought a bottle over. The bottle was hot to the touch. She said the wine sits in the sun all day. I settled for water.   I am gluten free. I can't help it. Gluten makes me ill. The Bistro does not have a gluten fee menu. I chose the almond salmon. My wife had a chicken dish. Mine came with twice baked potatoes. The waitress said she would ensure they were gluten free. After a while, when we had not seen our waitress, we asked another waitress. She said he potatoes were not gluten free.  I settled on a plain baked potato.   After more than an hour, our food arrived. Not sure why the delay. There were only five tables occupied. My baked potato turned out to be potato medallions. My wife said her chicken had a refrigerator taste. My salmon was too dry to eat.  Our waitress said she was sorry as she gave us he check."}
{"text":"Mama Mia, this place is a hidden gem outside of Las Vegas...all meals cooked to order, with great care...if you are in a rush, this isn't the place to stop. Relax, grab a drink, and enjoy an authentic Italian experience, in the most surprising of places."}
{"text":"Not my favorite meal. While the staff was very nice and they tried hard, the food wasn't particularly good and their red wines were really warm (kept by the window; not temp controlled). I had the chicken parmesan and it had that 'refrigerator' taste. My twice-baked potato was burnt on the bottom. My husband's almond salmon was really dry. He liked their chicken soup, though. If you are gluten-free, this is not your best choice. I'm not convinced that they really understand the ramifications to someone who is allergic to gluten. The decor is quaint and the restaurant seems to be enjoyed by some of the locals."}
{"text":"Why make a reservation when it means nothing. 730 means whenever there's a table open. No sympathy for your troubles. Mexican it is and they are so much nicer. Don't bother making a reservation 2 days in advance it means nothing.   Too bad you lost out on a good tip"}
{"text":"This place had high expectations when I walked through the door. Unfortunately they were not met. My expectations were driven through the floor actually. My dinner was so bad I contemplate why I ate any of it. The prices are very high but I justified that in my mind. I thought that \"well this place is probably too notch so that's why my steak is 40 bucks.\"   Well I was so wrong.   I ordered my ribeye medium and it came back burnt. I was practically cutting through a charcoal. The sides were sub par and the bread was just frozen and warmed up.   Huge wait. So besides the fact that I got to actually see what prison food was like there was something else. The wait. The agonizing wait. Seriously I waited a good hour and a half just to get some bread. That whole time I was actually thinking this was worth it. Kind of like the anticipation of waiting for a ride at Disney land. Except this ride was the teacups and it spun me round and round in a hellish torture.   All in all it was nothing special at all. If your looking for a nice evening for you and your girl don't take her here.( she didn't even finish hers) The service is bad and the food is worse."}
{"text":"When I ate here several times and had drinks it was always great. That was the best pork chop I've ever eaten.."}
{"text":"The Bistro is one of my favorite places to eat in Boulder! Passing through last week we stopped in for lunch. The menu had a great variety of sandwiches and the ones we tried were superb!!! But the rating of the 2 stars was giving because the service was poor and deeply disappointing :(  Putting it nicely, the waitresses mood was unpleasant. She was tired and slow, we've never had lunch take so long. The Bistro should really seek someone who knows their job and how to provide \"good service\" to their customers like we've had in the past dining with them. It is such a shame for us to say that our experience with lunch at The Bistro was such a flop!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. The previous reviews were promising. The small-ness of the place didn't bother me. The server was friendly enough. The cocktails were decent. My halibut was COLD in the middle. I'm not expecting super fresh fish in the middle of Boulder City but at least thaw it first. It turned me off so badly my appetite was ruined. This was my 1st time at the Bistro and it will be my last."}
{"text":"We were spending the night in Boulder City, NV on 12/28/13 and arrived about dinner time so we asked the woman at the front desk of our hotel for a restaurant recommendation.  She suggested The Bistro if we liked Italian, so we looked up the menu online in our room and decided to give it a try.  We didn't have reservations and it was busy the Saturday night after Christmas, but there were two tables available so they sat us at one of them.  The menu was impressive and the entrees we ordered were really delicious.  Their hot bread was very tasty and the salads cold and crisp and my Caesar was really good. While my husband enjoyed the Fettuccine Alfredo with chicken and broccoli (he likes it when the broccoli is still crunchy) I loved my Linguine and Clams (a dozen of them!) in white wine sauce.  Prices were reasonable and the service was good and friendly.  Definitely a place we'll try again when we pass through next Christmas."}
{"text":"needed a quiet lunch today so decided to stop here although I never stopped before because I thought it was pricey.  I had the most delicious spaghetti with marinara sauce and Chicago sausage!  All dishes are prepared as they are ordered so it can be a little bit of a wait but well worth it.  My lunch was $7.03 plus tip.  Will definitely go again but next time plan to get an alcoholic beverage from their interesting menu."}
{"text":"I have loved everytime I had the Bistro for dinner - Service has always been meh, unless you'd had Bryce.  So I was super excited to hear they were now open for lunch!  We went ahead and made a reservation for 10 a week in advance and made sure they would be able to accomodate a party of that size - no problems!  Well, we show up, right on time, with our table for 10 already set up.  The waitress brought us all waters (no lemons even though we asked).  She gave us a bit to look over the menu and took our orders.  Then we sat there.  For 45 minutes.  With nothing.  Finally, all of our food shows up - some cold, some burnt, some not cooked.  The pub style fish n chips were barely cooked - the breading was soggy - No vinegar, though she said she would bring it right out.  Had to double ask for ranch.  Cilantro rice was less than appealing.  Special tuscan fries for $2 extra were hardly special - plus, you only got like 4 of them - and they were barely cooked as well.  Weren't asked if we wanted dessert - though none of us were up for it, if we were basing it what we just ate.  Then leaving, I went to throw my mint wrapper away, but noticed I only had the option of an overflowing cigarette ashtray with beer bottles and banana peels (?? random) pouring out the side.  We all left extremely disappointed, especially myself since I was the one who suggested.  If I had never eaten dinner there before, I would have to say this lunch experience would make me never want to go back.  And I think out of the 10 of us, all but 3 had never been, so there are at least 7 non-returning customers.  I will definitely have to give it some thought...  Awful."}
{"text":"Went here with my gf and grandparents. Had reservations at 8. Sat at the bar until 845, then got seated. Ordered food at 850, and got served at 920. 1 of 4 meals was cold, 1 was wrong. Got out of there by 955. My grandpa had to get firm with the wait staff. No apologies, no seeming to realize there was anything wrong with the service. So much for reservations. So much for getting out \"quick\" to go into vegas for the evening."}
{"text":"Fresh made for each meal Cute little spot Good atmosphere  Crab cakes and lasagna were amazing!#"}
{"text":"***Horrible Lunch Service*** I must start out by saying that I enjoy the Bistro and always have had great service up until lately.  It has always had a personable and inviting feel which is what keeps me coming back.  Along with the fact that I love the chicken marsala and almond crusted salmon which is always outstanding.  When I heard about lunches I was excited cause dinner is always great.  I  have been to lunch there twice now and I will have to say that the food is still excellent (love the philly steak) but I'm very disappointed and the reason why I wont be coming back for lunch is because the service was HORRIBLE both times.  It wasn't the welcoming feeling that I'm used to cause the server, Nikki is not inviting.  She does not smile and lacks in customer service.  I understand that sometimes people have bad days but after going again I think that its just her demeanor?  She seemed sluggish and disoriented and I believe she was drunk or hungover both times; which obviously inhibits good service and work ethics.  She barely  checked on us for drinks and had forgotten our order cause she had to ask us again.  It wasn't busy either time so I feel the service should have been better.  The standards of what the Bistro upholds at night has definitely fallen short on lunches and wont be recommending it to anyone.  So sadly my future outtings to the Bistro will be for dinner as long as she doesn't work nights."}
{"text":"I wanted to start off my review by saying \"A hole in the wall - what a great find!\", but every restaurant in Boulder City seems like a hole in the wall... And not all of them are great finds...   Le Bistro Cafe, which the sign actually says \"The Bistro Cafe\", is indeed a great find. It is so quaint and homey inside with an open kitchen. Once you are inside, you feel like you're at your favorite Italian Auntie's home. You just know you will have great food in your tummy tonight!  The server brought us our bread and drinks right away. The bread was nice and hot. It was baked with Italian seasoning and cheese on top. Yummy. We had a bottle of table wine - it was a blend of everything - recommended by the server. It was a good wine that everyone can enjoy with our food.   We started off with the clams appetizer. It was broiled in a tomatoes red sauce. The clams were so big and fat - they were delicious! Must try it if you like seafood.   I had the shrimps pomodoro. The shrimps were tiger shrimps - they were huge! And fresh!! The sauce was very light and was made with fresh tomatoes. It was all you can ask for in a shrimps pomodoro. There weren't really anything that I can complain about with my dish.   One of my dining companion had the shrimps and scallops penne. I tried the scallops, and it was delicious!!! I love scallops, and I have eaten my share of scallops, but one thing I find is that most restaurants either overcook the scallops or undercook the scallops. Either way is a waste of a fresh scallop. Not at Le Bistro! The scallops were cooked just right, and the seasoning was perfect. Not too strong or too light - it complemented the penne and shrimps perfectly!  The boyfriend had the chicken parmesan. He liked it enough, but I thought it was delicious - yet again!!! The sauce was different from the typical parmesan. This sauce was light, which I prefer. The chicken was not too tough, and you can still taste the breading. Awesome dish, I thought.   This has became one of my favorite restaurants. I really want to try everything on the menu now. My drive to this restaurant is about 30 minutes, and it is definitely worth the drive.   Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"I am SO disappointed.  After having a craving for linguini and clams one day, my husband ordered this delicious dish from The Bistro to go. Needless to say, I was overly satisfied. The food was absolutely impeccable.  So, when my husband told me he had made reservations for Friday night, I was so excited. I reviewed the menu during work and could not WAIT for 7:30.  We arrived at about 7:20pm and the place was packed. I expected this as it was of course a Friday evening. My husband went inside to check in and when he came back outside (there was no room inside anywhere to wait which was fine) he told me that we were put on a list. I was confused because we had reservations. I just chalked it up to checking us in.  Thank goodness the night was brisk and not windy because we were outside for 30 minutes. Myself, husband, son, mother and best friend were all just waiting. No one was moving from their seats. Patrons were thoroughly enjoying their wine accompanied dishes.  We finally decided we needed to leave because we were starving. My husband went inside and let the hostess know. She was less than sympathetic and simply said, OK.  Ok? What is the point in having a reservation, my husband asked. She responded that they set up reservations at hour and a half increments and there was nothing she could do.  With our stomachs eating themselves, we decided to go to Toto's instead, which was absolutely phenomenal.  I'm beyond disappointed because I truly would have loved to experience The Bistro at its fullest. Unfortunately, their fullest didn't include us."}
{"text":"This restaurant is closed.  Reopening date is uncertain."}
{"text":"Drew and his crew are just amazing!! They accommodated my in-laws diet restrictions. Drew specifically made her dish which called for dairy free, gluten free! Maggie loved her pasta with chicken and asparagus! At the end TJ presented her with her very own dessert, which is a small bowl of fresh fruits and berries! That made their 60th wedding anniversary the more unforgettable!   Drew also made me shrimp fettuccine alfredo (which was not available that night!). All i can say is it's better than Olive Garden!! Thank you Drew!   Since we were so happy, delighted and satisfied with his personal touch, we have reserved a party of 27 for September! Our family from Texas, Washington, Oregon, Oklahoma cannot wait!!  Thanks Drew and Crew!!"}
{"text":"Where to begin...  We went to le Bistro one evening and the hostess was RUDE! She asked if we had reservations and while the place was rather empty (it didn't fill up) she tried to make us sit at the bar.  We waited quite awhile for a crumpled up piece of paper known as their \"Wine List\"...I opted for water at this point.  We ordered and our food arrived..when I asked for more bread with our dinner she ignored me!!  Chicken Parm...not bad not great...it was really tender but also very soggy. I am more a fan of crispy Chicken Parm..but this is just my choice. The spicy sausage and pasta was very yummy and had a bite not TOO spicy..it was great  Where it gets uncomfortable and the reason I will not return is the fact that the OWNER was DRUNK and flirting with girls very very VERY LOUDLY. He kept demanding his staff \"make him money\" and \"get shots over now\". It was so loud and obnoxious I just wanted my bill and to get out of there. He eventually talked his female friends to go to another bar I took note of where they went and did not follow.   Food wasn't bad but the OWNER of all people should stay away from this place if he's wasted..he should have been mortified of his actions..."}
{"text":"Everything appears fine, hostess was nice to us w/out resv.  O.K!  We sat by the front window, small not bad seat except when the front door opens.... in with the wind comes the dusty debris off the parking lot.   Fail  Ordered Steak & Shrimp special.  The cook must have a huge penchant for parm cheese.  It was ALL over the steak and gave it an off taste (burnt on) and extremely salty.  Same with the shrimp.  Why SO much parm cheese I have no idea.  Fail  To add insult to his OWN COOKING, everything on the plate was HEAVILY salted.   All over the asparagus, dumped on the steak as well as my wife's chicken picada.    Fail  Well, I understand why in Boulder City on a dusty highway WITHOUT any competition.    Hey chef, I hope you are readying this.... THROW AWAY THE SALT SHAKER.   If you are not reading this.... SOMEBODY SHOW HIM.  The dishes are all good conceptually, just not executed properly.  You can't earn anymore than one star with food like that.  Expensive ingredients hacked."}
{"text":"nice cozy spot for a great dinner at a reasonable price (for the quality) good service, be sure and get reservations, when you do its worth the drive,"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise and a great find! Anthony's Trattoria is a local gem here in Boulder City. Even folks from nearby Las Vegas make the trip here to enjoy the fabulous authentic Italian cuisine and quaint Bistro atmosphere.  I was greeted like family when I walked in the door. A beautiful young lady named Tracy was a very attentive server with a diamond personality. This friendly New York transplant knows her Italian cuisine and the great selection of wines they offer. My new favorite restaurant for sure!! I will definitely return soon!"}
