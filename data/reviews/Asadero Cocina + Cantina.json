{"text":"Let's start off with the bar offerings which can only be described as abysmal. They have a drink menu with already limited cocktails available, and half of them were crossed off. Apparently this is because their bar (or whole restaurant?) is being revamped and a lot of items are being phased out. I settled for their blackberry jalapeño margarita. Big mistake. It is by far the worst cocktail I've ever had and I'm not even picky when it comes to cocktails... like, store mix margaritas are legit in my book. There was zero fruit flavor. The drink wasn't spicy but that half jalapeño garnish on the top of the glass kept rubbing against my straws and set my lip on fire. The marg wasn't sweet and tangy like it's supposed to be. It tasted like tequila with sour, salty water. $14.  We had dinner with my fiancé's coauthor and my MIL, both of whom ordered their special of \"blackened\" seared tuna with ponzu and creamed spinach. The server (didn't catch her name) was super friendly and attentive, though she seemed a little nervous and confused. When asked what ponzu was, she said it was a creamy soy sauce which, while true to the dish, isn't really what ponzu is. The tuna was supposed to be rare on the inside. Looking at their food, it looked like the tuna was almost cooked through in some parts despite being an evenly cut piece of fish.   My fiancé ordered their NY strip with taters and asparagus. It was dressed in a demi-glace and very tender and flavorful. I think it's the best dish of the night. I had the braised short ribs with green chili mac and cheese and broccolini. The short ribs were coated in the same sauce as the steak. The mac was creamy and pleasant to eat with the ribs, which were fall-apart tender. The broccolini was cooked perfectly.   Their dinner menu boasts a \"market fish special of the day\". My MIL had dinner here the night before with someone else and when she asked about the fish special, she was told it was a \"beef filet with asparagus and wine sauce\" LOL. Don't bank on it being fish.  I had a Maker's on ice during dinner which meant an entire glass full of ice and very watered down bourbon by the time it made it to the table. The bar needs serious work."}
{"text":"I didn't really have a problem here but they didn't wow me either.  There was a woman who said yes to everything I asked but didn't deliver or follow up on them.    A new employee was most helpful but he was new so he didn't have all the answers.  I ordered a salad for dinner and asked if they maybe had French bread or a roll to accompany my salad.  Yes to both.  I received none.  I was sitting at the bar and the woman was right in front of me the entire time but I couldn't get her attention.  I was in a good mood so I didn't let it get me down.  The next day I just had a glass of wine and yay for me they had a nice Rose.  Typically priced for a resort hotel.  There were not a lot of walkable places so I was fine just chilling in the bar with my Rose."}
{"text":"Came here with a group touring the Scottsdale Doubletree hotel conference area. We decided to eat lunch on property to check out facilities so found ourselves at The Asadero. The menu isnt acceptional so we all ordered various salads and sandwiches.  I got a vegetable quinoa bowl with brussel sprouts, cauliflower and  butternut squash. Oddly enough I didn't really see any of the cauliflower and the other vegetables seemed to be cooked but not seasoned so the entire meal was very bland.  What could have been an exciting meal fell flat. All that,  service was pleasant.   If you are staying at the resort and need a bite you'll be fine.  For anything else I would  venture out and check all the wonderful restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. My husband and I are currently staying at the Doubletree. We picked up some tacos late Friday night because our flight got in late. We both felt sick to our stomach after eating the tacos. I think it was from the mayo in the cole slaw. The next morning we did not feel well either. I called and left a message with the food and beverage manager but never heard back and emailed the restaurant (also never heard back). I also called the following day and no one ever answered the phone. I can only assume they don't care. I would not eat here."}
{"text":"Another mediocre hotel restaurant that is overpriced.  The food here is awful.  The sandwich was so bad and dry and lacked flavor.  The steak was over cooked and after one bite I didn't even want to continue eating it so I sent it backZ. The bread pudding was some of the worst I have had in my life. Dry and bad texture.  The wings were okay and looked better than the sauces were.  The only thing I liked was the green chile Mac but for $6 getting a portion that is a 1/4 of an entree size was disappointing.  I would not eat here again.  I gave it 2 shots/. The staff was very friendly and accommodating and for that they get 3 stars."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Doubletree and visited the hotel restaurant twice. Our server Jennifer was awesome... We had her both evenings. Very personable, friendly and efficient. She was our favorite part of the meal. If only all restaurants had service like this! The atmosphere was very nice. A lot of little lights and it overlooked the palm trees and pool. And, the food was GREAT! I recommend it for a nice, relaxing, pleasant dinner!"}
