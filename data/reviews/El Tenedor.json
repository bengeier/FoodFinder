{"text":"Amazing food. Very earnest service. I felt like I was in a small restaurant in Barcelona. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings. Delicious food and generous pours. Very good value. $220 for two for food and lots of wine. Very intimate atmosphere. Recommend and would certainly go back."}
{"text":"Wonderful, innovative food, superb service, friendly and sophisticated ambiance. Tapas nights are a good bargain as you can order just as much or as little as you want while enjoying a nice glass of wine.  We have had dinner there several times and it is a delightful place.  We have never been disappointed at El Tenedor."}
{"text":"We stumbled across this gem when we were looking for a spanish restaurant and all of the other popular spots were full. Well, we were blown away by this find. It turns out the chef is an electrical engineer by training with a passion for food. He studied for a short time under the brother of Ferran Adria of El Bulli fame, which was rated as the best restaurant in the world. Ferran's influence shows strongly in El Tenedor's cuisine and everyone in Toronto who is a 'foodie' must try this restaurant. Given the small venue, the attention to detail both in cuisine and service is unmatched! I think I'm a fairly harsh critic of restaurants and I must say I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled in to this local jewel! I will be going back repeatedly and I'm almost hesitant to share this find with others, but I want the humble owners to achieve every level of success they deserve."}
