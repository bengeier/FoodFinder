{"text":"The Buffalo chicken pizza was pretty good for the price range, but the Mac and cheese bites were incredibly disappointing. They were $4.40 for six tiny fried cheese puffs."}
{"text":"Great wings and wedgies pizza is above average.  Bread sticks are the best"}
{"text":"Ollie's was the second pizza place we tried after moving here, and we haven't tried any since. We love their pizza! They have fast delivery and have never gotten our order wrong. Always pleasant."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick late lunch since I was in the plaza.    Ollie has pizza by the slice but it is Sicilian or you can order a small pizza.  Ordered the sicilian since not hungry enough for the small and it was a tad less expensive.  Well the pizza crust was toasted very crisp on the bottom but was like toasted bread with many airy holes like bread with pizza sauce and cheese on top.  The sauce and cheese were good but the crust just didn't make it for my tastes.    Guess I should have tried the small pizza and had leftovers.  The service was friendly."}
{"text":"THEIR HOURS DONT MATTER. I arrive and walk in about 3 minutes ago (10:43) and they tell me they're closed and everything is \"turned off\"  and his excuse is that \"they only serve stuff fresh... But then he tells me they don't close until 11 and his excuse to me is that they haven't received an order since about 1020 so they turned everything off... If it was 1055 I would be MUCH more understanding. I'm new to the area and moved here for business and was also looking for a good pizza place for corporate events (in addition to just finding a simple good place to grab a slice) and will DEFINITELY NEVER COME BACK and NEVER REFER ANYONE HERE."}
