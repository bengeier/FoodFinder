{"text":"Small and Very very expensive store compared to other stores in town. Dates and other stuff are not so fresh as expected. Meat not available always. Nothing interesting to buy from frozen area, way too small. For Olives, don't have much choice."}
{"text":"This store has good quality halal meat and is very conveniently located. Their prices are competitive and if they don't have something in stock you can see if they'll order it for you. Their roti selection is pretty good too. Bonus that they have great customer service. :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing for all your meat and veggies! Very hygienic and the couple who runs the place are the nicest people you will ever meet. This is my go to shop for any Indian groceries. I am glad they moved into my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Haben dort unser Fleisch geholt als wir in Las Vegas Urlaub gemacht hatten. Die Qualit√§t des Fleisches war sehr gut. Die Besitzer sind auch wahnsinnig nett zu uns gewesen."}
{"text":"This place is a ripoff and their customer service is horrible. The meat does not look fresh at least from our experience purchasing it from them. The butcher is trying to sell old ground chicken leg meat that's been in freezer for week rather than to ground chicken leg meat that's displayed in front. If you want to get fresh Halal meat at reasonably price please go to Afandi Halal Market. Trust me you will not be disappointed. Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Our favorite local/import store. A huge variety of spices and canned goods and seasonings, fresh produce, every type of rice and oil, frozen goods, and our favorite is the meat department. The chicken is fresh, halal, no antibiotics or preservatives. And they carry the lamb riblettes that they know I love so much. Their lamb comes from California! Their prepared kebabs are delicious- the work is done, all you do is put it on your grill! Delicious every time. Store is clean, well organized and staff is friendly. Have a look around- there is a lot for the eye to enjoy."}
{"text":"Affordable option to buy halal organic meat in the vegas valley. The owners are extremely nice people who are always willing to help!"}
{"text":"Great place for halal meat and Middle Eastern/Indian products. The butcher section is very clean and organized and they are accommodating to special requests. You can order a specific type or cut if they don't carry it. It's a family run business and everyone is friendly and helpful. We just moved to the area and this will be our go-to place for halal meat!"}
{"text":"Great place to buy halal goat meat. Just like the meat you get in Bay area! Will be buying goat meat and chicken only from here.   The store is clean and most important of all great service."}
