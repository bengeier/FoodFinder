{"text":"By far some of the worst BBQ I've had in my entire life. You have a choice between sweet and spicy, and I chose spicy. What came to me was a half slab covered in some wort of tomato based sauce that was over-seasoned with paprika and/or cayenne. The taste was harsh, not spicy. I ate a bones worth and couldn't do any more. Told the waitress it was inedible and she informed me that they serve them that way all the time. I guess they don't serve many of them, then."}
{"text":"Great food and people. And Tim the owner is one of the nicest guys you will ever meet. Keep up the great work Tim. Thx for so many years of great food, drinks, and fun."}
{"text":"Best hot wings I've ever had are right here. Actually everything I've had here is good, but the hot wings are just above and beyond everything else. They are the full wing too. My friend and I have a ritual that we do before we tear into a dozen of these suckers on Monday and Thursday night wing specials."}
