{"text":"Best Thai tea around. They have tons of other treats in store such as smoothies, protein shakes, ice cream, boba drinks, donuts and sandwiches. Prices are low and the owners are so nice. Definitely worth a stop if you're nearby"}

{"text":"I came to this donut shop the first week it was open. My mom and I came in to get my kiddos some treats and got more. The man who owns the shop was real am to please. Gave us a free chocolate muffin and gave us something he was thinking of trying out in the store. They have huge cookies and made an ice cream sandwich with it. It was amazing, oh and the donuts were still fresh given that we came at 3pm. They have a great lunch deal on their sandwiches that I have to come back for."}

{"text":"NO STARS!!!  DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE AND FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS HOLY, DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM THRU UBER!!!  We found this place tonight on Uber Eats and since it was down the street and their menu was so interesting we thought we would give it a try. HUGE MISTAKE! Not only did they wait until the food should have been delivered to contact Uber and have Uber contact us to let us know they couldn't fill our order because they were out of what they needed, but then they delivered the order with missing items and the food that was delivered was completely and totally garbage! Literally, we threw it in the garbage and ordered pizza! We took photos and contacted Uber right away, but despite us being customers for years and never having any other issues, they want to refer us to the restaurant instead of refund our money.  This was the worst experience we have ever had, just about anywhere. We took plenty of photos and even took photos of all their food in our trash bin and will post them all. For the record, we ordered a turkey sandwich, 2 tuna sandwiches, a pretzel with cheese, a bagel with cheese and 3 donuts. The sandwiches, especially the tuna were just fowl! They toast them, but don't tell you that in advance, so the top of the sandwich is hard as a rock, but the bottom is soggy and wet and gross! The tuna is \"dark\" meat and very fishy and it has no ingredients other than mayo mixed in. They also put a ton of tomatoes on one of the sandwiches that was not ordered with tomatoes. The lettuce was gross and the tomatoes are so not ripe they are hard and yellow/green/orange! The turkey sandwich ended up being ham because they did not have turkey....and they gave us a whole 3 pieces of it, seriously...3 entire pieces of what tasted like elementary school processed lunch meat! They forgot to send the bagel and cream cheese and one of the three donuts had to be substituted...not that it mattered because they tossed all of them in a bag together with no paper and they got melty and stuck together.  The bag was also open when they arrived, so eeewww!  There is not a single redeeming quality to be found at this place. EATERS BEWARE!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible customer service! After a late dinner, we wanted somewhere close & affordable for some good ice cream (Thrifty brand is our favorite) so we called to see how late this new place was open (we looked it up & it said 6). It was 9pm when we called & the owner said he was closed at 8, but would let us in anyway. When we arrived 2 minutes later, he was turning the lights back on & took his coat off to serve us, even though he was clearly done for the day & headed out. He was so kind & friendly & even served another customer who came in because the lights were on. We will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"Delicious donuts and great service!  Big selection of an assortment of donuts made fresh daily."}
