{"text":"Great variety of food on a daily basis. My co-workers and I stopped in for lunch and it was like finding a gold mine! The Prices were great ranging from $14-$17 and included a salad, main course, dessert and coffee. All the food is made fresh daily with each day having a different menu. How good is that?! I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting the area. Great Service too!"}
{"text":"I LOVED this place!  Unfortunately, it is now closed and being replaced by a Poutineville.  You know, since this town needs yet another poutine place, instead of what was simply the best Portuguese food I have ever had in my life!"}
{"text":"Super awesome place! Just as Sir Steven says - food is crazy good and cheap here. 

a $17 (canadian omg) daily prix fixe menu that changes depending on what's fresh. Some days you might have swordfish.. rabbit.. who knows? 

Service is excellent and it's a really nice little restaurant. I ended up eating here a lot for lunch when I worked at the hospital around the corner."}
