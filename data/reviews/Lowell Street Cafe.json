{"text":"This has always been our Sunday breakfast destination   It's always been good size helpings at a reasonable price. The decor is nothing to write home about.  It's definitely a dive Diner but sometimes that's where you find your best food. Sadly since there's been a change in ownership the food quality has gone down the serving sizes arent as generous, and  lot of my favorite waitresses have left still a good 
bargain to go for breakfast although I've tried some samples of their lunch and dinner menu and was not impressed. Last time i checked out the owner rang up $146 dollars instead of 14.60 he took care of it immediately but that could of caused big issues for me."}
{"text":"Bang for your buck is what you're getting here. The place doesn't look impressive but the service was excellent and the food was above average. Again best of all eating here won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that we will not be returning here again.  My family and I followed this establishment when it moved from Abbe Rd and changed names and owners.  It was always a great place to get an inexpensive breakfast that was tasty and filling.  Lunches were always decent too.  We moved a few years ago, and despite not being as regular as we once were, we would pop in every month or so for a bite.  

Two days ago, my boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch, and we won't be back.  The place wasn't packed, though the tables were definitely staying pretty steadily full.  We ordered from the specials menu, he got Paprikash, I got Chicken Cordon Bleu.  Our waitress was very prompt and nice.    

Our food came out in a reasonable time span.  But then that is when the problems started.  On my plate was a huge piece of fried chicken.  Leg and thigh, bone-in, breaded and fried.  The waitress came over when she saw me looking confused, and told me she would ask the cook to come speak with me.  She came back, apologetically said the cook was really busy right now and that she was told that this was the correct meal, that the ham \"is cut up really small and the cheese is melted inside\".  I peeled back the soggy breading, revealed the still pink meat with no sign of ham or melted cheese and she asked if I would like something else.  As we were running out of time, I opted for a chicken salad sandwich which came with fries.  Again, the waitress was very nice and very kind.

As the replacement plate was being prepared, my boyfriend offered me a taste of his Chicken Paprikash - which was as bland as it could possibly be.  Absolutely no flavor, salt wasn't even helping.  My chicken salad sandwich came out pretty fast and I ate it and the fries.  The bread was toasted and the chicken salad was cold.  The fries were hot and crispy.  

Then, we checked out, and that was the nail in the coffin of our experience.  There were two ladies in front of us waiting to place an order, and a man came from the front of the kitchen to help them. They ordered, handed him cash and he took the ticket to the kitchen.  And then he put toast in the toaster. . . .He didn't wash his hands, he didn't put on gloves.  He just handled a pen, an order pad, the register, money the woman pulled from her pocket and then food.  Toast, like the toast I had just eaten on my chicken salad sandwich.

Now it is our turn.  The same man comes back from putting the toast in the toaster, takes our ticket and makes small talk.  And that's when I (and my boyfriend too per our conversation after exiting) noticed the holey polo shirt he was wearing that's collar was caked, and I mean caked, not lightly dusted, or a few flakes, but packed with dandruff and hair.  

Believe me, I am not a snob, and I really enjoy mom and pop shops.  I like good down home food and am more than happy to try a different interpretation of a dish.  But the kitchen and staff need to be clean and the food needs to be properly prepared.  Unfortunately, Lowell Street Caf√© fell short on both counts, and the cleanliness is not something I can forgive."}
{"text":"This place is great. The staff treats us like part of the family. The food is always perfect. The whipped cream is crazy delicious. There is only one negative- no eggs Benedict.  I guess that's my issue, not theirs."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for years. I have never had a bad meal. The service is great, the prices are better. I mostly go for breakfast but we sometimes go for dinner."}
