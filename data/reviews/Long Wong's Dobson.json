{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! The wings are amazing, the staff is awesome and the price for any food item is reasonable. Definitely one of my top places for wings. I always try the 6 wings and pizza slice combo with a drink for only $6 and some change. How awesome is that!!?? Me and my boyfriend love this place and always come down when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Ordered for pickup and was told the food would be ready in 30 minutes. Got there and waited 30 extra minutes without explanation."}
{"text":"My favorite place to get wings. They are pretty quick. Menu has gotten bigger since opening. Service is good and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"They have good wings here, and many different flavors you can choose. The wings seem bigger than any other places that I went before. I like that they have free Wi Fi here, and the restaurant is clean. Will definitely come back for more wings :)"}
{"text":"CLOSED ON TUESDAYS My husband told me he loves this place anytime he suggests it I always grumble at him. I told him we should start to go once a week now, but only on Tuesdays. The wings are pretty good, but Everything just tastes so processed, the burgers are gross. I like the garlic parm wings very different fried and curly fries are good Pizza is subpar Service is OK at best So yesterday we went in and My son took one bite of his hamburger strongly disliked it. He asked if he could return it for a hotdog and the girl at he counter acted like it was a big deal and started asking him what it tasted like.... (umm bad, it tastes bad isn't that good enough he didn't like it now please can he have something else???) asked for it plain with ketchup only but got Mayno, lettuce and tomato, I wiped it off but it had soaked in. TO TOP IT OFF They had the TV's on MTv and they were watching Ridiculousness and there was  a video of huge male animal I cant even remember what kind because I was very distracted by the huge dong it had while it kept trying to mount the other animal video was zoomed in on this animals penis trying to connect with the female. My son looked at me horrified and it ruined my appetite for the already gross food."}
{"text":"I usually do not do reviews, but in this case I found it extremely IMPORTANT. First I would like to start off by saying this WAS my favorite place. I went in to purchase 200 wings at $55.49 per 100 per the WEBSITE. I was charged $146 plus change. When I took notice to the overcharge and addressed it with the OWNER. I was then told the prices changed 2weeks ago and some man was supposed to update the site which did not happen. Neither here no there the owner continued to go back and forth with me in regards to the price increase. The owner then asked that I show her the price on THEIR site which I angrily obliged. LOW and behold she still argued with me and decided to not give me the complete difference that was owed but to TRY and MAKE A DEAL. For what????? Might I ask??? Your site provided inaccurate information and you failed to honor it. I will NEVER step foot in your establishment again. Lastly it hurt more than anything to know I've personally been a regular at this location for at least 3yrs coming at least once a week and I can NEVER comeback. Remember CUSTOMER SERVICE is HUGE and you failed completely. Your GREED is what got you this review. I really hope you take a look at this and make some REAL changes. Sincerely your LOYAL customer NO more."}
{"text":"The only reason they got two stars was for the food (I love wings). Usually the customer service is HORRIBLE. It's definetly -100%  in that area. If it was one closer than this one I would go to that one. Great wings and great deal for 30 wings @ $17.99.  Increase your customer service Long Wongs PLEASE!"}
{"text":"Great place for fairly inexpensive casual food (wings, pizza, hamburgers, hotdogs, etc.) family/ kid friendly but equally appealing for for college students and the like the food is good and fast the place is clean - exactly what I expect from an establishment of this type."}
{"text":"I consider myself very positive and honestly don't mind bad tasting food here or there I think it's funny but the wings were honestly gross. Best part was the free refills onestly"}
{"text":"I love the wings here and I'm picky about my wings. These are hot, crispy and delicious. I might be back with 5 stars bcs I liked this little spot. It was nicer inside than I expected. I've only been a couple times so I'm reserving the extra star for when I've tried other menu items. But u will be back for the wings guaranteed! Love the Honey siracha sauce."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place doesn't  have more stars. Everything I have eaten here is great! Except for the pizza, which is why I gave them 4 stars and not 5. I have very high standards for wings and these are some of the best I've had next to ATL and wing street. The burgers aren't too bad and the french fries and curly fries are a 5 star for me as well. Not to mention the prices...cheese burger, 6 wings, and a drink for $8.49. Will definitely be eating here more often!"}
{"text":"You would think that by driving this place that the place isn't great. But WORNG! I've been coming here for the past 2 years and the wings and prices never disappoint me. They have a variety of flavors to choose from and also have pretty good burgers and pizza. Next time you are craving wings come here and ask for extra crispy."}
{"text":"Wings are always good. They taste better when they're not a rip off at $9.25 a dozen... Guess I'm gonna have to go back to making my own. Thanks for the memories, Long Wong's!"}
{"text":"Spicy  BBQ wings were bomb!  Mushrooms were pretty good too....nothing fancy but its pretty decent."}
{"text":"Wings were great! Lemon-pepper and honey-gold!"}
{"text":"Are used to go to Long Wong's when I was in college and it's been a few years in between since I've visited one. Tonight I was super hungry for some chicken wings and I had passed by Long Wong's earlier in the week so naturally it stuck in my head and I remembered how delicious their wings used to be. I got six mild wings, six barbecue wings, cheesesteak sandwich, fries, and a drink for all under $20. The wings were as delicious as I remembered them to be; crispy, yet moist inside and perfectly flavored with sauce. The cheesesteak sandwich reminded me a bit of a gyro and was delicious. The staff was friendly, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! My wings are always good and the prices are inexpensive. Only downside is that it is closed on Tuesdays! But other than that, this location is very clean and friendly!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE EVER!!!! The only reason people aren't DEAD after eating here is that grease kills salmonella. Health department should stop by and inspect the kitchen. Wings are not fresh, place is NOT CLEAN, in areas that should be ! Go to wingstop, anywhere else  in the world but here, I repeat the ONLY reason no one has DIED is that frying the food kills the SALMONELLA . Send the health department A.S.A.P. I had to leave a star but they deserve a half of one."}
{"text":"Soooooooo good!  Mind you this is not a fancy place with delicate flavors .  BUT... it's affordable and satisfying for sure.  ------MUST HAVES------ Wings (extra crispy) Cheese curly fries Fried zucchini Tall ranch cup  Only issue is the pizza. I've only had it once and it was by slice. It was stale in a way but still hit, I didn't quite get it lol I just know I would not order again."}
{"text":"Best wings around for sure. The prices on everything is hard to beat too. Fast service and friendly people make this place awesome."}
{"text":"My boyfriend says his wings were great so they aren't getting the 1 star I would give them for the overcooked leathery fried zucchini that I ordered.  I managed to eat 2, but now I feel sick.  I wonder how old the oil is they are using?  We took it home or I would have returned it."}
{"text":"I love how they always raises the price. However, Long Wong is still cheaper than the Wingstop that is 2 minutes away from my house. Despite, you will be charged $0.50 if you pay with card. A dozen wings cost $10.13 tax included now."}
{"text":"I swear they have the best steak sandwich in all the East Valley hell let's include West Valley to it's just the best in the whole valley"}
{"text":"Very disappointed , found hair in my burger .. There boneless wings was nasty , the sauce was so thick and caked on like frosting ....  I would never return back . I wouldn't give any stars but I had no choice too ."}
{"text":"Wings were solid, blue cheese on the side was very good. Ordered a Roast Beef Sandwich and it was the grossest thing Ive ever seen. Meat was hard and dry like a jerky. Beware of the roast beef sandwich but the wings are worth it. Wish they'd ditch the styrofoam to avoid the sweat from the wings on to go orders. Cardboard absorbs it and makes the food less soggy."}
{"text":"Do not! I repeat, do not buy the mesquite chicken sandwich . Worst sandwich ever!!! Thin dry very crispy pieces of chicken on a large amount of lettuce. No mesquite flavor to be found. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Honey hot wings are my absolute favorite.  It's a scam they charge .50 extra to pay with plastic.  Young female staff is more interested in the vulgar music on the TV than doing their jobs. I wish staff didn't use the Men's restroom (get your own!).  Great value."}
{"text":"I love long wongs !!! Today I finally tried the boneless wings and I fell in love. The girl in the front that took my order is so nice and helpful. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Wings are really yummy And at a fair price.. Best ive had here in this area.. Customer service is ok they do need a lil work on that"}
{"text":"Great wings, best price in town 30 for $18. Love the hot spicy honey wings. They also have very good burgers. Great place to order Togo food for football game"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go when we are at that end of Mesa.  Fantastic food, great prices and specials.  Wings are very good, so are the sandwiches and Asian dishes.  HUGE selection of menu items.  Always difficult for me to decide which great dish to choose."}
{"text":"This place was alright, I didn't get a really welcome feel by any of the staff and the service wasn't that great. The food was good but not the best but they had good prices. Although the price did show with the quality of the food. Overall it was a decent place to eat at a good price."}
{"text":"Only got wings, but was not disappointed.  Decent size wings and really good hot sauce.  Friendly and fast service and pretty busy for a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"The garlic parmesen were good.but a little heavy on the sauce.. The hot wings were great.. crisp and saucy and delicious.. the burger was ho hum ok.. great bun fresh lettuce and tomato.. not enough hot meat.. but sort of hit the spot.. the fries were not super hot but could have been stellar if they were.. The bummer was the drink situation.. not a pepsi fan and no unsweet tea.. my worthless pancreas cant have sweetened drinks.. and pepsi isnt my preference.. so that was the biggest bummer.."}
{"text":"Lil girl answering the phone needs some serious training. Super incompetent and disrespectful. Don't see the point in arguing with a customer who's just trying to put in a quick order. When i proceeded to ask for managers information she refused."}
{"text":"First time to this location. Great service, reasonably priced and the chicken wings were freshly prepared, hot, tasty and filling. The only thing is we did order a box of fries to go with our meal and the fries were NOT fresh. They were old, cold and hard as though they had been sitting out for a period of time. Staff was friendly, and welcoming. The location is small and there were several customers dining in. It was clean, and busy. It's located in a small plaza that consists of other businesses. I will return to this location but will double check the fries next time should I order fries again before leaving. All in all, no big complaints."}
{"text":"Not a good first impression .... Tuesday no wing special .50 for credit card use .... then no refunds.... then we can split a flavor for any wings !!! Rude cashier"}
{"text":"The best wing place I have ever eaten. It's cheap, it looks great inside(very unique experience), and fast service. I tried the honey siracha with the French fries, which by the way were great with the Cajun seasoning, I personally will eat here again. Great service. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place has the best chicken wings I've had in the valley since we moved here from New York State. My husband agrees, and he lived in Buffalo for 19 yrs."}
{"text":"Their food is pretty good if you are looking for yummy junk food. Love their fried zucchini and wings. Burgers are ok. What I really like about this place is the variety of different items they have and the prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Customer service has greatly improved. Lunch was good! Love the zucchini."}
