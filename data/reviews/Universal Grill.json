{"text":"Great local place for food! They have amazing brunch here! Great staff & atmosphere! It will be worth your while to come out here & not just for the locals. The ambience for brunch is a light cafe fare & not to loud. Great portions of food."}
{"text":"Located in Christie Pits, a little bit off the beaten path, this chic retro bistro won my heart on the first visit.   An eclectic mix of enticing international food items, an extensive wine list, and remnants of sleek 30s decor.   Portions are not for the faint of heart. Could barely finish the giant heaping of crispy polenta paired with sweet tomatoes, capers, olives and goat cheese, let alone the tender provini calves liver, panseared to perfection. A small taste of the baby back pork ribs was divine.   This is high end comfort food at no small price. Something to satisfy everyone's palate.  I'll have to try brunch."}
{"text":"Since eaten brunch here twice. I used to think the huevos rancheros they used to sell at Grapefruit Moon was great, but this is on a whole other level (and how it's supposed to be made as far as I can tell online). Chipotle seasoning might not be for everyone, but I'm into it, even though the bean content is pretty high. Next visit I had a brunch special, salmon gravlax on an egg bun with eggs and potatoes on the side. Overall, I'm just happy this place doesn't serve eggs benedict, a.k.a. where brunch goes to die from boredom."}
{"text":"This is a great little upscale diner. I feel that the prices are a little high, and that the service can be slow when it's busy. But the food is generally very good.  I've eaten the:  Steak and onion rings -- steak was a good size, and cooked just how I asked. Onion rings almost seemed like they were tempura battered, very crispy, light and sweet.  Calf's liver and onions -- I'm not a huge fan of liver normally, but I was feeling in an odd mood that night, so I went ahead and ordered it. The onions were caramelised with a touch of grain mustard for a nice zing. The liver was tender, just a little crispy from the pan, and I actually thought it was ok (which is saying a lot for me and liver). Red potatoes to go with were good.  Chicken curry -- I've never actually ordered it, but my neighbour and his wife swear by it. Apparently the chef is from Sri Lanka, which explains how a place like this can have good curry."}
{"text":"Was there this past Saturday, and unfortunately the food took so long it kind of ruined our experience. It was busy, but looked like lots of people without food. My boyfriend and I were late getting to our next destination, so we had to eat in haste when our food was finally there. The omelette was good, but again I couldn't really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Great food and cozy eclectic space. We've gone several times for brunch and gotten take out for dinner. One of our regular go - to."}
{"text":"Great menu. Always packed.  No bad choice on the menu. Get there just before opening time on weekends to get a seat for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for our very first date. I had never tried a Mexican Brunch place before and was completely blown away. The Huevos Rancheros is awesome. I love it so much that I never try anything else. Its always our go-to place for brunch! My husband especially likes their sauces on the side!"}
{"text":"Food here is always pretty good. To ensure getting our group of 6 seated, we arrived 20 minutes early and stood in the cold and rain. Got seated first, but waited for coffee. Then 6 other tables had their orders taken before us. Still sitting here 59 minutes after being seated and no sign of food. Other tables are paying and leaving. Very very disorganized and frustrating."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot.  If you want to get a spot for brunch, come early or you will be waiting awhile! The grilled cheese is amazing."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. Although I don't think you will actually commute to this part of town, you might be a local and having seen this restaurant on the corner sparked your interest.  Well, don't bother. I'm giving it 2 stars only because of the brunch that was kind of satisfactory, but also largely spoiled by the fact that the advertised \"Fresh squeezed orange juice\" for the price tag of 5$ is nothing else than a glass of tropicana or similar. The server was insulted when given the remarks and said that \"it is just made somewhere else\".   Dinner. The atmosphere is actually nice and cozy, but you don't come to a place just for that. Soup of the day (5$) was extremely hot in both senses - burning your tongue and also spicy. I'm not an opponent of spicy food but here they seem to sprinkle everything with spice massively and indiscriminately. Rigatoni (16$) was one very average meal, the basic pasta thrown into roasted red pepper mass, with some eggplant and cheese on the top and baked a lil' bit. Spicy seafood stew (26$) was nothing in particular, a fish stew that so many other places prepare way better. Fish of the day (26$) was looking tiny and without anything coming along. Haven't bothered to try the 25$ ribs. Creme Brulee was good but didn't catch the price tag since they use the fishy old registers that don't print the description on the invoice but rather a mass of unconnected numbers. The bill for 4 with no drinks was 150$ pre tips. The price range for this place is $$$. (31-60 per person).  Oh, almost forgot, they only have Amsterdam on tap....."}
{"text":"The food is simply Amazing. There is not much more to say. The ribs were really meaty unlike other restaurants that like to cheap out on their dishes. As a starter I got the protabello mushroom salad which tasted divine. Even though the location is far from me, this place beats all the local girlls in my area."}
{"text":"I was excited about this place when I moved in down the street.  Now I know.  AMAZING!  The patio was decadent on a nice summer night.  The flower boxes were pretty, and the seating layout gave an intimate ambiance not often found in the Toronto patios I usually haunt.  I had the pasta special - linguine with a nice light wine sauce, basil, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, leeks and goat cheese.  It's a dish I was a little scared to order (it can go very wrong) and it was absolutely delicious.  The prices are what you would expect for the quality you get - less than $20 for most entrees (steak costs more, surprise!) and appetizers were about $10 each.  Noteworthy: the martini menu looked great.  Next time!  I will definitely return for more patio awesomeness soon, and see what else is cookin' at the Universal Grill.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Universal Grill is one of those restaurants that every neighbourhood should be lucky enough to have.  It easily transitions between no-fuss bistro dining in the evenings to bustling brunch on the weekends.  The staff are all charming, capable and thankfully make a killer Caesar (tip-o-the-day: try a little of the house hot sauce in there to remind you it's Saturday).    I've rarely been disappointed with a meal at the Grill.  Rajah's Dry Ribs are my usual staple.  I don't know how many spices get caked on the outside of those lucky pieces of pork but they give me a smile every time.  They come paired with a large portion of yam fries and coleslaw.    The specials change quite frequently and are usually fantastic making the most of local farms.  Reservations are probably a good idea in the evenings but if you want brunch, get there early."}
{"text":"My one regret will likely be not coming here for dinner in the almost four years I lived in the area. That said, this review will focus strictly on brunch and more particularly on their Huevos Rancheros which is the tastiest, most original version of this dish that I have ever had.   Nothing in the dish is overpowering, and nice touches such as the toasted tortilla strips sprinkled on top and the delicious, homemade hot sauce round this off quite nicely. If you're there early enough (signalled by the fact that there isn't yet a line up practically going out the door), you just might be lucky enough to order the potato latkes and salmon gravlax (this sells out often). Their omelette of the day offerings seem tempting on the times I have contemplated them but let's be honest, I am there for the Huevos Rancheros.   One of these days, I will make the hike back up there again."}
{"text":"The space is nice. The dry-rub ribs were good, but they're too happy with the deep-fryer. What looked on the menu to be mini crab cakes were more akin to blasted Mcnuggets."}
{"text":"I came to Universal Grill for brunch about a year back- it tasted great, was crowded and bustling, and we were in and out fairly quickly. An OK experience but nothing that made me want to crawl back for dinner. Too bad that I've wasted so many months thinking about where to eat next when what I was really looking for...was staring me right in the face the whole time (sort of like Fox and Scully).  Came for a dinner in what I'd describe as an \"upscale-diner\" environment. The menu had a comfort-food vibe, but designed by someone who's adept at preparing more classically higher-tier fare. Does that make sense? I hope so.   The ambience was great, the servers were kind and beautiful, and my main dish of cornmeal crusted cod was perfect. Very much in the face of my \"there's no good seafood in Toronto\" attitude.   I went with Evelyn W, so It was actually a 4-star experience...but I won't take that away from them. Great meal, great friends, see you tonight."}
{"text":"This fantastic place has felt like a neighbourhood secret for many years!  Mixed emotions that it's catching on because there is often a wait for a table for Sat/Sun brunch. I have never been disappointed with the service or the food.  I have had Valentines Day, New Years Eve and countless dinners at The Universal.  It'd just fantastic.  One word though - as a parent I can say...this isn't a place for the rowdy small child."}
{"text":"This adorable retro-looking resto was recommended by a friend a few months ago and after ending up in that hood on a lovely Sunday, and actually recalling said recommendation, Universal Grill was to be the next breakfast joint to undergo the Omelette Test. (Don't worry if you're not familiar with this particular experiment assessment, since i just made it up. But you know, it's pretty self-evident.)  The omelette of the day - which as a concept always makes me nervous since it means there's a chance that I may have to forgo my fave way to have eggs if meat is involved - was the enticing combination of arugula, Gruyere cheese, onions and tomatoes with home fries and rye toast on the side. My brunch-mate had the French toast and an espresso whereas I went for a coffee to accompany my omelette.  Verdict? Yummy! I'm personally not that big of an onion fan - I prefer green onions and even then chopped finely and used sparingly for flavour - and found myself pulling out the strings of purple onion since I didn't want a mouthful of all-day bad breath. But that's just me...  The omelette was fluffy, the cheese perfectly melted and kudos to whomever thought of including arugula. I love it as the main leaf in salad, with crumbled blue cheese of course, but have to say although I routinely worship at the temple of Spinach, the idea of including arugula in an omelette never occurred to me. No more! It is DEFINITELY getting thrown into rotation now.   Ah yes, the sides. The home fries were evenly seasoned and crispy enough to steer clear of soggy while not at all overcooked. And who doesn't love a nicely toasted piece of rye bread?  As for my partner-in-brunch's French toast, the presentation alone had my mouth watering and I'm not one for the sweet-in-the-morning thing. Piled high in a deep plate with a heap of airy whipped cream and warmed raspberry compote, this was a French toast that could make me rethink my Salt Over Sweet stance...maybe. I want to say they used challah bread but since I didn't ask, it remains a hunch at this point.   So no complaints about the food then. But opting to sit outside, which initially seemed like a perfectly harmless idea, ended with a swarm of wasps nearly constantly buzzing around our food, to the point where one met a sugary death in my friend's side of whipped cream.   Naturally, this has nothing to do with Universal Grill's super-quick service - we got there 10 minutes before the kitchen was closing - friendly staff or delectable brunch eats, but intended more as a word of warning to fellow patrons who opt to hang out on their fairly-small front patio during the summer months."}
{"text":"One if my favourite places to eat. On par with The Drake, they take their time to cook the food properly and when the dishes arrive I'm never disappointed. I've had pretty much everything they serve except for seafood; I am allergic to shellfish.  I like the spicy hummus they serve at the beginning of the meal.   Universal is the best place to visit if you're a fan of roasted chicken. The skin is seared to perfection and topped with a tasty duxelle of mushrooms and onions in red wine and served with scalloped potatoes and green veggies, usually rapini.   I always order a side of home-made onion rings with my food; it's a delightfully crispy dish I enjoy sharing with a dinner companion.  Universal Grill is good at bringing in seasonal foods too and keeping the frequent attendees informed of specials by email. Hint: get on their email list. A friend ordered a side of fried fiddleheads and they were sublime.  I've enjoyed nearly every dessert they make (not all at once). They're not store bought nor brought in from a franchise bakery (Dufflet Pastries). Everything is made on premises.  The staff act like they care for their patrons. Universal Grill has a decent selection of wine on hand and the servers are good at pairing them with the food the kitchen sends out.  One of my top ten restaurants in the city. It's not my neighbourhood so I drive to it, but parking is easy to find."}
{"text":"I came here once for brunch with my aunt and uncle on a Saturday morning.  I'm a late on this review, when I went there it was still warm out and we sat outside which was really nice.  I had the eggs benedict with salmon and it was phenomenal.  We also all shared the potato latke and it wasn't bad.  The coffee was good but nothing spectacular.  I enjoyed my experience there and would probably return, maybe try their dinner."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. All around solid brunch spot. Pancakes are my girlfriend's favourite."}
{"text":"Adorable space to go for brunch. It's a bit difficult to get to if you don't live in the area. (And by difficult to get to I mean it's not right on the subway line. Yes, I am spoiled.) We walked up from Ossington station, and it took about 10 minutes. We met for 10:30am, which was perfect timing because this spot is SMALL, and it being (an unseasonably warm) February, we didn't feel like waiting outside.  I ordered the huevos rancheros. They were really good, and I was pleased at the large portion of guac that was served with it. I hate it when people skimp on the guacamole. The meal was filling, although I wish that I had ordered a side of meat. Because meat is delicious.  I was less impressed with the lox and latke. The latke was soggy. Tsk tsk for a soggy latke.  The service was relaxed, but attentive. There was a mix up on the bill though, with a $3.50 side being coming up as $35. I'm sure it was a one time mix up (I've worked serving, it can totally happen), but it might be worth it to keep an eye on the bill.  My meal and tea came to $20 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Had brunch there today for the first time. Waited a bit for a table, but it was sunny outside, so it didn't matter much. Ordered the huevos rancheros without any dairy and it was the best I've had --EVER. Service was great and the place was clean."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and have walked or driven past this place probably a million times. Does not look from the outside like anything inviting but it is worth a trek. We went for Sunday breakfast/brunch around 11 and put our names on the list since they don't take reservations. They told us it would be about a 45 minute wait so we went to do some grocery shopping at Sobeys which is right across the street. Once we got seated at the counter, we enjoy the delicious mimosas. The only thing I would complain about is the speed of the service. It should not take long to prepare a breakfast meat. It was delicious but slow coming out.  I definitely would recommend checking out this hang out but like someone else mentioned, definitely no kids, there just isn't enough space for the strollers."}
{"text":"If the Universal Grill were a little closer to my home, it would be my go-to for brunch with houseguests.   This little place is equal parts attitude & food.  I found the hipster vibe an eensy bit obtrusive, but the cheesy omelette is extraordinarily tasty.  The Saturday-morning wait almost starved us to death, but a seat at the bar eventually opened up, followed by a booth.  I'd like to go back for dinner some time, preferably when they're not playing an entire Bob Dylan disc."}
{"text":"Delicious food, fast service and their yummy HOT SAUCE!"}
{"text":"If you're patient enough to wait for a table, this place is well worth the wait for brunch. The interior may not be aesthetically pleasing but the food is scrumptious. I stick with the pancakes or the huevos rancheros and they're so incredibly satisfying that I haven't tried anything else.   Try it. You'll looovvvee."}
{"text":"\"Get the ribs\"  Is the only thing my friend said when we sat down in this intimate little bistro - a converted, former general store from the 30's/40's as evidenced by the pictures above the bar.  So I followed her advice.  Our other dining companions stuck with Rajah's Dry Ribs - which were just fine - but I prefer my ribs wet.  Sauce was delicious and served with a smattering of coleslaw and a heaping full portion of yam fries that I dipped in the BBQ sauce.  Huge portion.  The rest of the meal was ho-hum.  A special lamb meatball appetizer fell totally flat as did their calamari, which were limp and bland.  Dining room was almost empty when we dined on a Thursday at 8:30 pm, so service was present and friendly.  Unfortunately, our waitress was a little inexperienced in wine service.  She spilled a few times which was totally forgivable, but upon opening a second bottle of wine, she began to top off our glasses that had some wine left from the first bottle - which is a huge no-no.   Otherwise, this is a cute, decent option for locals and as my friend, who is a local said, get the ribs."}
{"text":"One of my favourite brunch spots in the city.   The potatoes/hash browns are unbelievable. Huevos rancheros are a favourite too.   The pancakes are shockingly good but quite heavy. Recommend sharing them with a friend/s, but I do highly recommend them.   Have yet to go for dinner but the menu sounds great"}
{"text":"The place does a good job at making comfort food meals.  Age group that comes to eat here widely varies.  The restaurant has a lot of charm.  The place gets busy.  In terms of criticism:  When you charge above average prices for restaurant eating, patrons will be more picky in regards to service, drinks, food and dessert.  So... here is my review.  You can tell a lot about the front staff when they're tested with the unfamiliar. Asked for an amaretto sour.  She was honest enough to say she didn't know how to make it but they had a recipe book behind the bar that she could consult and would try her best to make it.  (She did come back and it was well done) I later wanted to be adventurous and ordered one of their more complicated lime cocktails that they advertised on their menu.  It was too salty, too sour... she followed Universal Grill's recipe and i would say its just a bad drink.  I just want to make a point, small things can affect an evaluation of the overall experience.  Staff need to be more confident and learn to fake that they are good bartenders... either wise you start doubting what you're drinking.  (But really stay away from the lime drink)    Food.  Had the Rib Eye... it had some cooked vegetables, onion rings, crispy fries.  The dish was well executed.  Portions was a good size.  Dessert.  Got the feeling the creme brulee was prepared outside the restaurant.  Wasn't bad.  I would come back on a special occasion because its close to where I live.  The fact the place is busy in an area where there aren't many restaurants says they make people happy."}
{"text":"Food was good!  It took a pretty long time to come out but I think only 1 cook was on duty so I'm sure that was the reason."}
{"text":"A favourite stop every time I visit Toronto and has become a gathering place full of great memories with family and friends. Cocktails are sensational, the menu always reminds me of Sophie's Choice, I will have to leave at least one loved one behind. The Rajah's Dry Ribs usually win the day (as well as a place on most best of Toronto lists) order a bit of sauce on the side. The tile is ample and delicious and treat yourself to a side of onion rings, they are darn near perfect. When the mussels are available, they are spectacular. Portions are over the top substantial but try to save room for dessert. Never a disappointment. Fresh quality ingredients all, combined with uncommon skill and attention to detail. And a delightful low key atmosphere, a bit out of the way and better for it I think. I've never felt rushed. Fine service. My number one go to in Toronto,or did I mention that already?"}
{"text":"We came by for Saturday brunch after a BlogTO review.   Ambience -- Cute. It's a tiny neighbourhood diner, seating 25ish, plus a tiny patio out front. If you're three or more, you'll probably have a substantial wait. We showed up around 11 and got seated at the counter immediately, while a group of four was already waiting at the door. Comfy -- plenty of elbow room, and the chairs had backs for our coats. Lots of friends and families with very young children around.   When the Amelie soundtrack came on, I almost, *almost* rolled my eyes, but I do actually really enjoy that movie, so I pardoned the tweeness.   Service is good to fair. Since the space is small, it's not hard to find a server (of three, when we were there) to flag down, but they are constantly bustling. You do have to be a little aggressive; they won't be catching your eye a lot. Otherwise, they're pretty friendly. Don't be mean because they're a little hipster.  They have a good selection of options, and a daily special menu. My boyfriend ordered French toast with a side of bacon, and I ordered chocolate chip pancakes.  My boyfriend and I both had pleasantly strong mimosas ($7) and I eventually had a nice, bold cup of coffee. They have a coldbox behind the counter for milk and chilled wines, which we found charming.   The pancakes took FOREVER. We didn't notice as much because we were happy chatting, but eventually we slipped into the \"where's the food?\" mode. It took a while before the server updated us that the pancakes were taking a while because they're baked (cast-iron pan). Fair ... but they're still pancakes. Not sure how staffed the kitchen is; I thought other food seemed to be coming out at on a casual timeline too.  The pancakes were enormously tall. I really prefer my pancakes light and fluffy, and these were just a little dense for me. They had great baked crispy edges, if you're into that. Crazy filling -- I only ate one. There was also maple syrup, raspberry compote (tangy and tasty), and a side of melon and pineapple.   My boyfriend finished off his French toast (also enormous) and declared it delicious. The bacon was also excellent -- not too crispy, but not too limp.   Happily, they take debit and cash, though they took a while to pick up my card.  If I lived nearby and could drop by, this would be a decent, if not super cheap, option, but I'm probably not going to make a point of going back."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever....and we didn't even taste the food! My pregnant wife and I arrived to meet 2 friends - no one greeted us; no one acknowledged us when we said hello; my wife asked if we could take a 4 top at the back, we were told 'not til it's clean' in the rudest way possible; then told we couldn't be seated til our friends arrived, at which time the table was taken by a new group of diners.  We decided to wait at the bar and order a starter - where we were told if we ate anything at the bar we couldn't move to a table later....I pointed out my wife was 7 months pregnant and needed to sit and nibble on something. The blonde female server said nope, with that COULDN'T CARE LESS look in her face. Needless to say we left, right after I let them know how I felt about the whole experience.  I'll NEVER GO BACK. I work all week in the service industry making sure all my guests have a fantastic time. It's just the worst being mistreated on your day off. What a terribly run dump."}
{"text":"Great cocktails! Delicious food!   They removed the charcuterie tile off of their menu. It's a shame because it was so good.   Booths rock when you sit in them - which is slightly jarring but otherwise a comfy, wonderful indie find!"}
{"text":"I like this place for its solid good food and diner like atmosphere, been here multiple times and only for branches so I can't vouch for other things in the menu but I love the huevos rancheros with the home made spicy deep on the side. Kids like the pancakes too. It is in my opinion a little bit on the pricey side to charge $15 or so for couple of eggs..."}
{"text":"I've been to the Universal Grill twice for brunch and you can't deny how great the food is. The patio is lovely in the summer but I find the inside to be a bit depressing. My big complaint: the INSANELY slow service. We asked after our food about an hour after we ordered and probably still waited another 15 minutes after she told us that everyone else was waiting too. I don't recall if service was this slow the first time we went, but I'll only ever go back and check when I know I have all the time in the world and when no children are accompanying us. (Keeping a hungry 2-year-old entertained during a 75-minute wait for food can be rather challenging.)"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch and the food was ok. I got the Huevos rancheros and the eggs were overcooked but all in all it was pretttyy ok. The flour tortilla + vegetarian chilli + sour cream and guac were all great. The only thing was that it was so spicy and I only had a small glass of water. I repeatedly had to ask for it to be refilled and sadly it never was.   Our service was awful, ok they were nice but so slow, we had to repeatedly ask for refills of water and coffee (water never came, coffee came one, no hot water refill on tea) and we also asked for hot sauce which came soooo slowly. Having to wait to eat your food is really annoying! Oh ya and when our server gave us our food we still had to wait for cutlery.  bah."}
{"text":"Just a few feet down the street from my house, Universal Grill is a unique little spot that has yet to disappoint me with their dinner menu. it may take a little while to get my food sometimes, but their stuff is tasty and always a little inspired. A cozy spot to eat inside or out, I can't, however, laud the same praise on my brunch experiences there (I've been let down 2 out of 2 times), but maybe my expectations are too high after having dined there in the evening."}
{"text":"This place basically has a lock on the area... There are no other decent restaurants along this section of Dupont and you would have to be a fool to pass up their patio in the summertime.  The food is incredible. I have ate pretty much everything on the menu more than once. Top choices are the Rosemary Roast Chicken (the scalloped potatoes are off the hook) and the Black Angus Sirloin. They are apparently most famous for their ribs, though I am not a fan of ribs in general this place converted me. I have had the dry ribs numerous times and they are incredible.  The staff are incredibly nice. The place isn't very big so it might be hard to get a table (especially during brunch hours) but if you do then it's a nice cozy atmosphere. Prices can be a little high, but well worth it given the quality of the food. They have daily specials including Linguini, Salmon and an incredible Lamb Burger!"}
{"text":"Came in on Yelp recommendations to get a quick bite. Turned into a gourmet experience!  Margarita- Only had better at an authentic Mexican place in Bradford (MexiCanada). Wonderful traditional flavor and properly made and presented.  Dry Rib- Excellent. Wonderful taste, not overwhelming the meat, meat done to perfection. Was told it was more spicy than the wet rib, loved the heat. Had it with a nice Malbec  Coleslaw - best I have ever had. The sauce was creamy but light and didn't overwhelm the veg. Very fresh and crunchy.   Sweet Potato Fry- done nice and dark (double fried) and still full full of flavor but no grease AT ALL.  excellent job.  Atmosphere- low key, dim lights and excellent music mix. Easy to slip into an indulgent mode. Very comfortable in the diner decor and the simple bell used to signal the next order being ready.  OVERALL - WOW! Will be back. Can't wait for patio season!"}
{"text":"Took myself on a date here last night. It was epic.   I had: 2008 Malbec from Argentina $11 French bread with chipotle hummus (complimentary) Portobello mushroom salad $9 Slow braised veal ossobuco with garlic rapini, butternut squash polenta, and pinenut horseradish gremolata $26 White and dark Belgian chocolate flourless cake with raspberry whipped cream  The portobello salad was perfect. The mushrooms were cooked in a delicious balsamic which cut nicely with the fresh slices of parmigiana. The two items were on a bed of spinach which had a light drizzle of olive oil.  The main was a healthy portion size. I was a little hesitant to order the dish because of the horseradish part of the gremolata but it was really well done. The pinenuts came through with the flavour and the horseradish backed it up. The polenta came as a cake on the side. I would have preferred the ossobuco to be on top of the polenta but it was still delicious.  The flourless cake was great also. If you're a chocolate lover then this is the dessert for you. It wasn't really my cup of tea, but I have no complaints.  Overall I like this place. It has an old diner charm but romantic ambiance. This changes for weekend brunch, but as far as dinner goes it can be an intimate occasion should you choose. The restaurant only sits about 30 people which adds to the intimacy.   When I arrived at 6:15 there was one couple and one guy at the bar. I was banking on it being slow considering it was two days after Valentine's Day. The waitress said that it usually gets busy later, which I noticed as the 7:30 reservations started showing up as I was close to leaving."}
{"text":"Went to have brunch this morning with the family, we were seated fast and given our menus, but then left alone. the couple next to us were served, ate their meal, and given their cheque, while we still sat waiting for our orders to be taken. after 15 minutes of the servers going in and out, serving those on the patio, and not looking in our direction once, we left. It's too bad too, because they have pretty decent food and we wanted to share it with our family.   Although, all the servers thanked us on the way out... for leaving?"}
{"text":"Most of these reviews are for the breakfast or brunch, but a group of us came for dinner and thoroughly enjoyed our experience here.  DECOR: Casual and kitsch, like an old school diner. No need to get dressed up here.  SERVICE: Our waiter was attentive and polite, and made good recommendations. It was a good thing we made reservations too, as the place became packed by 7pm.   FOOD: I began with the warm portobello mushroom salad with balsamic dressing and shaved parmesan, and it was really fresh. Not too heavy, and large enough to share between two people. I had the duck for my main course, which was the dinner special and not on the regular menu. I'm a big fan of duck but don't eat it often, so I couldn't resist. I had it medium-rare, and it was cooked perfectly. The side veggies were cooked nicely too. Tried the steak and ribs too, and both were incredible. Next time, I'm absolutely getting those ribs. Meat fell off the bone, it was tender, and the sauce was out of this world. We all shared the crumble a la mode for dessert, and it was to die for. I'm glad we ignored our full bellies and indulged for that dish!   DRINKS: There is a great wine list, but we brought our own bottle and were very pleased that they did not charge a corking fee.   Overall, this was a really fun place to come for dinner. The menu is simple and not lengthy, but I personally prefer a shorter menu anyways. I can't wait to try the ribs and hot chicken curry for dinner, as well as the brunch menu. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"This is probably my go to place for their ribs. They have two types of ribs you can choose from (dry or regular) and you can get both if you want. The food comes out quickly, super well priced and the quality of food is high. I would recommend going here if you want a solid spot for a date or just a bite to eat. When you walk in there are booths for people to sit just like a diner. The owner is also really nice and friendly to everyone!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance and interior of this restaurant. The place is very quaint and romantic. The food is very good value and very tasty."}
{"text":"Did not eat there, but I did sit in and there music choice is superb! I fully enjoyed the experience!"}
{"text":"Just had a fantastic brunch at Universal Grill.   Ordered the steak and eggs, latke and a buttermilk pancake on the side. We ordered the eggs over easy and they were cooked flawlessly. The steak came a perfect medium rare and the latke was fabulous. It came with a crispy outside, soft and flavourful inside, and a healthy dose of sour cream on the side. The salmon was great. The pancake was really thick (not what I was expecting) but so yummy. The raspberry could combined with the maple syrup and fruit with whipped cream provided a delicious sweetness to our meal.   Staff was attentive (always refilling our coffee) and the atmosphere was cozy for the drizzly day outside. Everything was a great, we will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Came here for Sunday brunch and lo-behold, there was a line up. This place is relatively small and seems to be popular. We waited about 20 minutes for a table which was ok. But we did also wait another 20 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered. I did notice however that another table got their food before us and we had ordered the same things. So that was a bit annoying.    Now on to the food. My huevos rancheros was a generous portion and it was very good. The eggs were fried just right. For someone who doesn't like beans, this dish actually surprised me. I would go back just for this dish alone. My sister's buttermilk pancakes were very soft and thick. The syrup was good and not too sweet. The raspberry compote was like icing on cake.  We also ordered juices and their juices seemed to be freshly squeezed.  Overall, food was good and definitely worth it as their portions are very generous."}
{"text":"Honestly, I was really underwhelmed.   I met up with some friends for brunch and we were looking for a patio and some brunch.   I ordered an omelette, a friend of mine had the grilled cheese and another friend of mine had the huevos rancheros.   To say I was underwhelmed would be an understatement. I was once told by a chef that you should gauge a kitchen by how well they make an omelette. Well this place did not do great. It was dry, bland and just really unsatisfying.   I believe my friends enjoyed their food, it wasn't the focus of our conversation, but neither of them complained openly about it.   The service was really slow. Slow enough that we really noticed how slow it was. The patio was busy, but the whole place was and it wasn't that we were being ignored because we were on the patio, the place was just slow.   The worst part was my caesar. I was CRAVING a breakfast caesar, you know a little pick me up on a lazy Saturday. Well this just was the worst. It was watery and underwhelming.   One of my friends had a mimosa and said it stunk too.  Given all those issues with the drinks and food, it seemed really over priced.   Anyway, I don't know I'd go back. I'd really have to be convinced."}
{"text":"Universal Grill, you deserve a full on update. You're still a five star dame, and you need some extra love. Here's why:  Nightly specials have never failed me. Locally sourced and spectacular soups, fish and veg specials.   Their rigatoni on the fall menu is the best pasta dish I've had in eons, plump with cheese and eggplant. The new fall cocktail list is something to croon about. Lavendar mojito? Yes please.   PEPPER POINTS OUT: This is a pricy place for dinner. Best saved for a special evening with someone you love, or at least someone who is buying."}
