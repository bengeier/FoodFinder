{"text":"I can't say anything bad about the food and didn't notice anything bad about the washrooms. It's not the expensive prices that make this place bad, IMO. Afterall, there's lots over priced places with delicious food in Toronto. IMO, what makes this place bad is the owner. He's just not nice. If one brings in unwanted food or if some old lady puts her bag  on his table, he just goes APE! Most restaurants don't allow foreign food. Fair enough. However, there's always a more tactful way to deal with the situation that doesn't involve yelling and screaming at some low income senior citizen. If you want to wait for your date to arrive before ordering, even she's just 5 minutes from arrival, he kicks you out or forces you to order. Other places allow you to wait. Heck, I've been to Jack Astors and they've let me wait 30 mins for my date to arrive. The thing is, he doesn't go out of his way to make people WANT to come to his establishment. Those people who bring outside food and that old lady who puts her bag for a second on his empty table  or even that young gal waiting 5 minutes for her godmom to come and don't want to drink coffee before her arrival are all potential customers. Smart managers know that."}
{"text":"I like this place...good brunch...awesome also for your sweet tooth....I also really like their espresso. Ricardo and his wife are really friendly and they serve quality food."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of time and I will never come back. The place inside is very cold, no wifi and not very kind people working there. Cafe Cranberriesoffers slightly over priced food."}
{"text":"Chourico on the bun is great though quite expensive for the bun used. Just had the steak salad and it was pretty bad. Half of it was full of onions! Is that normal? Took picture of it because I can\"t believe it. If these guys want to charge these type of prices then you have to do better. Deserts are also meh."}
{"text":"Easily a 5 star for what it is... no nonsense comfort food with an amazing twist on fresh ingredients. The passion Ricardo shows was evident and came through in both the service and the food.  With the picky palette my daughter carries, it was encouraging to see her finish her plate. Found a new favourite local restaurant."}
{"text":"This place was dead on a hot Thursday afternoon even with their patio open, there were no guests. They have lots of breakfast stuff on the menu, but I was there to have lunch. I ordered a veggie burrito and the presentation was very appealing when it arrived. It was extremely hot to eat and I'm someone who enjoys eating food at a warm temperature so I had to wait a long time for it to cool. The burrito was very bland, I know I ordered a veggie burrito but it really needs some spices to bring out the vegetables flavours. My sister ordered a cheesecake and cappuccino and it looked great. After my burrito, I had some \"gelato\" - it tasted like ice cream. However, they serve you lots of it when you order it in a cup. I will come back though, its just not my go-to cafe."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but lack of tasty food really hampers this restaurant. Their cappuccino (which they claim is best in the neighbourhood) is pretty lack lustre. Tastes a bit watered down. I would only come here for dessert."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here twice now and have had two wonderful experiences. 
I'd recommend trying the breakfast tacos. The service is very friendly. I love the latin music played. Also, there's an amazing variety of hot sauces to try!

{"text":"Horrible. Just horrible. 

My group shows up on a Saturday afternoon to find one employee in the whole business. There are several tables and the same lone employee is responsible for taking orders, cooking the food, serving the food and collecting payment. Needless to say, service was slow. 

The food itself was medicore and severely overpriced - you can pay up to $10 for a tiny sandwhich. They clearly do not use premium ingredients - it's basic cheap food at a premium price. The cake was store bought and the cheesecake was served at room temperature (eww).  

The worst part of the trip was the extreme dishonesty or unhygenicness. The server/cook/cashier/owner refused to serve us tap water. When I asked why, she said that it was because the building had \"bad\" water. The water wasn't bad enough to stop them from using it to cook, clean (their hands and the dishes) and to use in the washroom. So either this is a filthy restaurant knowingly using (but not serving) dirty water, or they are crooks who try and trick their customers into buying pop, bottled water and coffee. Lies like this insult everyone's intelligence, and they ruined our lunch."}
{"text":"Service was great, Marisa greeted us right away.  Tasty waffles, perfect crunch and generous toppings.  Delicious Brazilian coffee."}
{"text":"First time for brunch today. Delicious croissant egg sandwich, and breakfast tacos. Food is simple, fresh and tasty. Good service and reasonably priced. Enjoyed the strawberry and banana fruit plate. Will come back to try other menu items. Would like to give it 5 stars but Yelp removes my 5 or 1 stars since I am relatively new reviewer."}
{"text":"One star because I've got to pick something.
Place is starting to physically fall apart and is in desperate need of a cleaning. If the walls and floors where customers are, are looking grimy I hate to see the hidden kitchen areas. 

Staff are continually rude or dismissive. Will not allow customers to use the washroom before a purchase.
There are MANY other cafes within a block east or west, no need to take rude service and mediocre food when I can walk a block.

WILL NOT RETURN

Update June 2016.
I happened across the Facebook page for this restaurant and wrote a review, I was actually kinder than my previous review here. 
Nonetheless I was told \"sorry you had a bad experience, I guess 3 employees at a small business isn't enough for you, why don't you go eat microwaved McDonald's food and only wait ten minutes.\" Or something like that. 
I think if they could delete my review, they would have by now, go check them on Facebook."}
{"text":"Cranberries is a perfect place for a quick breakfast.  This is a \"go-to\" place for me and my wife on weekends as we live in the neighbourhood.  While not the classiest breakfast place in the neighbourhood, this place has great service, great coffee and a great breakfast at a lower price than expected.  The added bonus is the small patio in the summer.

I love their breakfast sandwich, the toppings and bread are fresh.  The size of the sandwich is quite large too.

I also love their breakfast waffle, it just hits the mark with its fresh strawberries and bananas.

Thanks, Cranberries!"}
{"text":"They are a little bit on the slow side but the wait worth the food. we went there for brunch and it was really really good. Just be patient."}
{"text":"Had a good coffee there. The service was good and friendly. They're open late-ish which I like, many places around here close early. During our stay someone ordered a dessert waffle; it smelled really good.
It's a little overpriced but I think it's worth another try!"}
{"text":"This place appears to be getting a super bad rap here, and I can't say I understand why? I've had the PLEASURE, of having breakfast/brunch or just a coffee numerous times and the food has never been anything less than exceptional, the coffee stupendous and the service.. well It's been awhile since I've been made to feel so at home in a place.

Here's what I've had, and what I recommend you give a try the next time you're in:

1) Caramel Latte - Not overly sweet, not too strong, but a great value and delicious

2) Breakfast Croissant - Egg, Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo, Cheese. Stick it all in a pannini press and take it out once grilled and buttery all over - divine

3) Brazilian Omelet - Was a little different than what I'm used to for breakfast, but worth a try if you enjoy Portuguese sausage

4) The Steak Sandwich - I seriously don't know where someone else got \"shoe leather\", my sandwich was melt in my mouth amazing. And since when does a\"to go\" sandwich come with sides? People... this is easily a secret steak sandwich YOU NEED to try and YOU NEED to know about! (Remember who told you this)

Here's a couple of fun facts:

1) Owned and operated by a husband and wife and their family. Nicest people ever! If you visit more than once and you chat with them, they make you feel totally at home and like one of the family - even remembering your names and your order. You don't get service like this anymore

2) Their coffee beans are specially roasted (specifically their decaf) for them. The decaf beans they use go through a special Swiss water process to eliminate all traces of caffeine so that you know you're getting 0 g of caffeine in your coffee. The Sbux and 2nd Cups of the world cannot make the same claim as their decaf still retain some caffeine.

Ignore the negative comments, and take it from me, this place is a small hidden gem in the Junction worth giving a shot to!

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast and dessert stop. Had to have the Nutella gelato brownie, delish! ! Owner is by far the nicest and most accommodating man. Can't wait to be back to try more"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast. Eggs, sausage, banana, orange and strawberry. Toasts. Filled with enegry and good mood for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"This is possibly one of the best independent cafes in the uptown Toronto area.  The ambiance is similar to that of Starbucks.  Portuguese pop music play softly throughout the store.  The washrooms are clean and rarely run low on toiletries.  The seating area is seldom crowded and have plenty of comfortable leather couches to rest on.    

Their menu offers a wide array of European style desserts, pastries and breads.  I'll admit that I'm not much of a dessert fan or anything sweet so I can't comment on how they taste.  I mostly order coffee or tea based beverages when I walk into any given coffee shop.

The staff however may need a little bit more training in the art of communication.  One late evening, I ordered a decaf red-eye and the barista looked back with a confused face and replied with \"I'm sorry sir I can't make that because we don't have that on the menu.\"  Instead of that reply, she could have asked her fellow co-workers on how to make it or ask me \"What is it?\" or \"How can I make it?\"

Overall, Cranberries Cafe is the ideal place to have a casual chat with your mates or have a mug of fresh brewed coffee while reading your favourite book."}
{"text":"I work around the area on Saturdays and I love getting breakfast.  Food is great and coffee is really good. Love owners too.  I have been going there for 3 years.  The owners recently came to our Christmas party and donated 100 bucks worth of gift cards.  
Great people and awesome food"}
{"text":"The worst breakfast I've ever had. Everything was gross from the bacon to the sausage to the salad. Not to mention they served me half a hotdog bun instead of toast. I do not recommend eating here when there are much better options in the neighbourhood. The service was good but that's it."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast burrito! And the No 7 hot sauce they offer and sell is fantastic. A great place to hang out with friendly service and a nice vibe. The soups are also very good and perfect on a chilly day."}
{"text":"Ahhhh and wahhhhh The Junction!!! One day you will have a really nice restaurant and maybe a really great Candian food cafe that will bring out the foodies.

For now, we can only keep hoping and eating really good sushi and Vietnamese.

Cafe Cranberries is a clean place that offers slightly over priced food. I had the recommended 8.50 steak sandwich. It came with no sides and tasted a bit more like shoe leather. 

The place has no wi-fi. It does offer breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The place gives a large ad space in the restaurant for desserts. Most of these are 6.99, which seems a bit steep for the place."}
{"text":"Editing to add that Cafe Cranberries have significantly improved their service, i don't want to include my previous review. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the croissant breakfast sandwich and pancakes. Everything was good. Service was very fast and the server was very friendly. The place was full and he still managed to not keep us waiting at any point! Also very good prices and everything was fresh. No complaints!"}
{"text":"Everyone was very friendly and the service was fast. I ordered the tacos and my partner had the huevos rancheros. The food was not very good. I ate it, but all the tacos filling was just cooked all together like a stir fry and the tortilla fell apart. It tasted like something I would have made in university, not restaurant quality like I expected. Too bad because I had heard good things. Maybe my taco bar is just too high. My partner didn't like hers either.

Redeeming qualities are convenient location, coffee came in big cups, service was fast and friendly, and they have number 7 hot sauce which is local. If they can improve the food I would be happy to return and give 5 stars! I would love that and hopefully it will happen."}
{"text":"Truly tasty food! I have to Cafe Cranberries several times and have never been dissatisfied. The thing that stands out with them is the excellent service. Every time we go, we are greeted with a warm and sincere \"Hello! How have you been?\". Their food is top notch as well, my favorite dish the tostada (with beef). The filling is flavorful and the beef is always tender. The crepes are great as well."}
{"text":"Love to go here on Sunday mornings. Pancakes are delicious and their lattes are amazing! Staff are really nice and upbeat. I purchased an almond croissant once and I walked out of the store forgetting it on the counter and the girl ran out just to bring it to me and I was on the other side of the street. 

If you're looking for a healthy breakfast spot, this is the place. I swear everything is served with salad so you can't go wrong . The menu has many options and you'll definitely find something you'd  be craving."}
{"text":"Came with a friend expecting it to be the same as the one that used to be next to Yorkdale and was disappointed. Had a croissant sandwich and a coffee which were mediocre."}
{"text":"Fake chicken! 
I know it's tricky reviewing a place after one visit, fake chicken, however this is the internet and no one can stop me. fake chicken.
I finally tried this place after it being around awhile, fake chicken, and popped in for a coffee and grilled chicken sandwich. fake chicken. The coffee was fine and staff seemed pleasant, fake chicken, but the \"grilled\" chicken was FAKE!
You know that \"chicken\" you get at Subway? Spongy and weird, and made up of chicken beaks and butts and god knows what else. Put that between two pieces of bread and charge $8 for it.
I don't know what else to say other than \"fake chicken\"."}
