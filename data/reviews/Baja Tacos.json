{"text":"Place is good. As described is a traditional paisa Mexican joint. Challenge is right across the street from filibertos. Worth a try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"In town for Az Bike week, and happened to stumble upon this little restaurant, which is amazing! 

The food was excellent, service was perfect and the SALSA is extraordinary!

Thank you for the astounding dinner! See you next year!  :-)"}
{"text":"Wow!!! This gringa will be coming back frequently! Chips were crisp and delicious, salsa was homemade and unlike any I've had before (it was sweet! And amazing!), and our main food. Oh wow. The rolled tacos were hand made. So much better than Filis. The chimi was so big it filled the plate. We had lunch for two with lots left over for $20. Can't say enough great things about this place!!"}
{"text":"They are NO longer open. I loved this its sad to see they closed down. There food was good and not badly priced."}
{"text":"Wonderful new restaurant in mesa . Baja tacos captures what I have enjoyed for years, a taste of baja!

The shrimp tacos are amazing, the owner is warm and accommodating.

The place is new but her kitchen soul is old and wise when it comes to taste buds.

Thier family are baja natives, they also have been involved in baja racing so bring some stickers or swag you like and put it up on the board !

True Mexican cane sugar coke is here too, this place is authentic baja. Lots of Mexican influence and a walk out of your ordinary.

Try this place out!"}
{"text":"I love mexican food, I have gone to so many places in search for the best mexican food. I honestly think I found it! It was my First time here. Let's start with the chips and salsa. The salsa was AMAZING, and chips were really good. I ordered large carne asada fries, it was huge! Definitely too much for one person. My boyfriend got a carne asada chimichanga which was delicious, which was pretty big as well. Total was $21. For two meals we normally pay about $30 at other mexican restaurants, so it's much cheaper. This place is my new go to mexican spot"}
{"text":"The food was middle of road.  Good value for the money for the lunch special.  

Note to the owner...the music was so inconsistent with regard to volume. At one point, turned up so loud that it drove every patron out of the restaurant. Not sure if you were trying to push everyone out, but it worked."}
