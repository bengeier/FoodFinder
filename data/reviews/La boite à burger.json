{"text":"This restaurant has potential, but unfortunately, they fail on implementation. 

In the past, we waited 2 hours for a delivery. As compensation, we were offered a free meal the next time we ordered. Good enough for me, after all, s*it happens, right?

So the next time we ordered, we called and explained what happened and verified that the meal would be free. They checked, then agreed. Great. Except that the delivery guy showed up expecting to be paid (and since they outsourced the delivery, he had himself already paid for the order!).

If that wasn't enough, after a couple of months of not eating there, we thought that we would give them one more try. After all, none of the other burger places in Verdun offer veggie burgers. 

Big mistake. They put things on the burgers that were not in the description. Mayo on my friend's hotdog (mayo on a hotdog?!), cheese on someone else's chicken burger, a burger that was breaded and fried -- also not in the description where it was described as a \"chicken breast\". 

They also put mayo /all/ over my tofu burger, and since I don't eat eggs, that rendered it pretty much inedible. 

It was a complete waste of a meal for everyone involved. A waste of food, and money and time. 

The olds joke of ordering out when your home cooked meal doesn't work out? Yea, we cooked supper instead after this \"food\" arrived. 

On the plus side, it looks like they have resolved their delivery issues. The guy showed up around 30 minutes after we placed the order."}
{"text":"After receiving a take-out menu at home, we decided to give them a try. 

Although they have a nice selection of burgers, I went for the \"The Giant\" (which could be considered the basic burger), my girlfriend chose \"The Tofu\" veggie burger.

My burger was great, the patty was nicely cooked, although I needed to add a bit of pepper to enhance the flavor and make it perfect to may taste.

As for the veggie burger, my girlfriend was very satisfied, she said it's one of the best veggie burgers she's ever eaten.

I will surely go through the menu to try all the different kinds they offer."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I ordered twice from La Boite à Burger. The first time was great; we received our hot burgers and drinks within acceptable time and they were very tasty. 

The second time however didn't go so great... I do not like to badmouth restaurants but it was a bit of a fiasco; it took over 75 minutes to get our food delivered, they forgot the drinks and we had to call and then wait another 45 minutes to get them (burgers were long eaten by then as you can imagine), and I had asked no pickles in my burger and I got them anyway. 

With La Boite à Burger, you either get everything or nothing it seems... At least the food is good. Service is at your own risks!

Worth mentioning they have 4 options for vegetarians, and among the two I've tried (Le BB and Le Tofu), Le Tofu was most delicious."}
