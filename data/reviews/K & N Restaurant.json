{"text":"Great little restaurant in ambridge they are always busy the food is fantastic especially the chicken Philly sandwich made using Mancini's bread is awesome you can't beat the price either"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunches! Their crepes and buckwheat pancakes are awesome. Hot Sausage and fries is one of the best lunches in town. The French fries alone are worth the trip."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast, 50's pictures line the walls and old style milk shake maker behind the counter.  Prices are great and the food is just the right amount.  Left felling satisfied, not stuffed ... A revisit is definitely going to happen.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around. Good prices very frendly place to eat. If you want a home made meal this is the place you should go."}
{"text":"I love this little, \"if you get there too late it's standing room only \"place. The kitchen manager Josh makes sure they rarely run out of anything, while the waitresses seem to never forget your name or face. Excellent portion size. Even better prices. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Just went here for the first time and the food was delicious! Although they served the country fried steak as a dinner, they let me have it as a breakfast with 2 eggs, homefries, and toast on the side. The toast was buttery and crispy, and the eggs were cooked perfectly. I'm usually really picky about breakfast potatoes, but their homefries were delicious as well. Really great prices for the amount of food you're given. Some of the best breakfast food I've ever had from a family restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great little diner with doo-wop charm. Excellent breakfasts and the crepes are heavenly! Decent portions for the money and the prices are very affordable. Lunches and dinners are all under $10. Breakfasts are anywhere from about $4 to $7. Friendly waitresses who are very attentive and remember what their regulars want without them having to even ask for it. Casual and comfortable. Definitely a try if you haven't been there yet!"}
{"text":"Friendly waitstaff, cute retro vibe, great food and prices! 4 stars only because we waited over an hour for two breakfast entrees."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Best diner around. They keep your coffee filled and I love the waitress that works there. She's always super nice to my kids as th breakfast is great!"}
{"text":"A cute little dinner, perfect for a quick breakfast. The decorations take you back in time, it looks like you jumped back into the 50's. The staff is helpful and friendly! Ask for Heidi to be your server, you won't be disappointed. There isn't a microwave in sight which is rare for diners. 

I ordered the scrambler and one pancake. My girlfriend got the eggs Benedict. My dish was a really large portion and it was cheap. I got bacon in my scrambler, which was a great choice. All of the ingredients were throughout the dish, nothing was missing and it was cooked perfectly. I wish I would have gotten two pancakes because it was so delicious! Very buttery and fluffy texture. 

The Eggs Benedict was okay. The sauce was a bit lack luster, it didn't have much flavor. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the yolks were still nice and runny. Hard to find perfectly cooked eggs even at high class restaurants. The portion was just right, very filling. 

I was very pleased with the experience overall, I would definitely return in the future. It's a little too far from Pittsburgh to come often but it's a great place to get away from the hustle and bustle in the morning. A great local find!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Come here for breakfast every single time we're in town!  GREAT food, FAB prices & SUPER friendly and helpful staff who are on it -- you take two sips of your coffee & they're right there to fill up your cup!  Old school diner filled with regulars -- that you can tell are probably almost like family!  Coming here makes me feel happy & nostalgic for the older simpler times!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to K & N Restaurant. I had been told to check it out by more than a few people, and I am glad that I did. The Veggie Omelette was delicious and our waitress was incredibly sweet and attentive. I recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys small town hospitality and cooking."}
{"text":"Came here to try somewhere new for breakfast and it was definitely worth the trip! I loved the old diner feel that you get as soon as you walk in, there's so much to look at and even though it's not huge you don't feel like you're on top of everyone else which is always a nice thing. The omelettes were huge, I got the bacon and cheese and my boyfriend got the meat lovers and they were both packed full of ingredients and took up over half of the plate, along with the home fries and toast it was definitely more food than what I could handle. It was hard to believe we only spent around $7 a person with drinks for as much as we got, awesome!! The waitress was super friendly and the food came out pretty quickly too. I'll definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"Most of the food is pretty good but stay away from a few things, most notably the reuben sandwich. The meat they use is very grisly. I almost choked on the thing."}
