{"text":"Rainbow rolls and the agedashi tofu were delicious. Spicy tuna roll is my typical favourite- but the version offered here is 'different' and I'm not sure what sort of sauce they use on top but it looks and tastes unappealing. While we dined in, the take out orders were flying out the door. Certainly popular sushi take out. The food is fresh and fast - and while it's no Sushi bar Zipang - it's not bad."}
{"text":"I went to Momo-Yama for dinner last week for the first time. We ordered the beef tataki, agedashi tofu and the sushi & sashimi combo. The portions were a lot larger than I expected. The ponzu sauce for the beef tataki was flavourful and delicious. My only complaint is that the beef was still a little on the frozen-side.  The agedashi tofu was however a complete miss. Instead of using the soft silky tofu they used a stiffer tofu which totally took away from the dish and the batter was a little on the stiff side. The large portion size (8 pieces) certainly didn't make up for it. The agedashi tofu in no way compares to the one at Wa's.  And the sauce for the tofu was a little sweetened (i.e. it is non-traditional). 

The sushi and sashimi were ok. The fish were fresh and the pieces of fish were very large (i.e. good value).  However, there was no sense of authenticity in the preparation.  The miso soup also did not taste very authentic.

I would recommend this place to a person who is looking for good value (i.e. large pieces of sushi and sashimi for a good price) but definitely not to a person who truly appreciates the presentation and art of japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for good sushi - and it isn't easy in landlocked Calgary.

In this case, I've been pleasantly surprised. I've been once for lunch and once for dinner (same menu, I believe) and the quality of the fish has been consistently good. It comes at a refreshingly low price, too.

The beef tataki makes for a tasty, tangy appetizer and I have no complaints about their maki or nigiri sushi, aside from a slightly over-done piece of unagi (eel.) For those who dare, they have a pretty wide variety of maki listed on the menu, although I'll stick to my negitoro and rainbow roll, thank you very much.

Momoyama loses marks for its service, though. The most recent time I was there for dinner, everything started out nicely and attentively. However, as soon as we had finished eating, our teapot was whisked away and we were asked if we had paid for our meal (?) to which I replied, \"We haven't even gotten the bill yet.\" I understand that there was another party waiting to be seated, but we weren't even an hour into our reservation time yet. Another server quickly came by and apologized, but I was not impressed.

I believe this was an isolated incident by a new server, which only slightly marred an otherwise delightful meal.

$30 for two people (two rolls and about ten pieces of nigiri.)"}
{"text":"We went there for lunch and had a BBQ pork ramen ($10) and then a magicarpet roll ($15.50).  The waitress had a very hard time with English and I found it frustrating to get the order accurately placed.  The ramen was a decent portion, but the flavour was something you'd expect from some package.  The sushi roll is a salmon based one.  The size and flavour was somewhat uninspiring for the cost.  Parking sucks at this old strip mall.  There's no reason for me to return."}
{"text":"We arrived at 1 pm and ordered the lunch special bento box.  A very generous portion.
Good variety of sauces on assorted items.
Well worth the money. We will recommend to our friends and neighbours."}
{"text":"Extremely rude, arrived too close to closing time so they would not serve my gf and I. 25 mins to serve sushi is not asking a lot.  Just moved to the area, they didn't earn a dime and never will. Three thumbs down. Signed up to Yelp just to let the world know."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced with large portions, especially for the sashimi.

We had the adedashi tofu, a few rolls and sashimi, all which was very tasty and well done.  The only thing that wasn't excellent was the chicken karage, which was a little too breaded tasting heavily fried.  

Overall a good experience.  Make reservations tho, since it is a small restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been doing to Momo-Yama for years.  Unfortunately the great quality and presentation are gone.  It appears the restaurant is under new management (ownership?).  There's no comparison- Momo-yama used to be close to authentic sushi, and now this place has become one of the Korean/Japanese hybrid sushi restaurants with mayonaise in all of the rolls, lower quality fish, and less precise presentation.  

Now having said that, they've painted and made the place look a bit better. I'd trade all of that in an instant for the better sushi to be back again.  Sigh."}
{"text":"We had an enjoyable dinner here after a full day at Stampede. Since our little guy (5) isn't a fan of sushi yet, we ordered the salmon teriyaki and sushi for the adults. The salmon teriyaki was delicious! We all shared it as it was a very large portion. The sushi was fresh and delicious so an all around great meal."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place in the city. The portions are generous. Tako sunomono is delicious. Fish is good. One negative is no wild salmon. 


But be warned they are a little different than run of the mill Japanese restaurants.  Their salad has a neat apple dressing, not the sesame one most know. They do not have tempura to order."}
{"text":"I dined at Momo-Yama for the first time recently. It's very small and crowded, so making a reservation is practically mandatory. We came in at 6:30 (we had a reso) and our table was one of only two empty. The staff were all friendly and rather efficient, though they also do a lot of take-out orders, so the staff's attention is split between take-out and dine-in customers. There is no privacy and tables are close together, so if you're looking for a cozy, romantic sit down meal with nice decor, go elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a casual and cheap bite to eat, there's nothing wrong with this place. 

We ordered assorted nigiri sushi and two rolls. We had salmon, tuna, smoked salmon, mackerel, red snapper, eel, and yellow tail. All the fish seemed fresh; taste and texture were good. Portion sizes were appropriate for the price. We both thought there was too much wasabi on the nigiri sushi, and were quite disappointed that they put wasabi on the mackerel and smoked salmon. I've never had wasabi on smoked fish and it ruined it. The unagi (eel) was good but a little small. Also, I watched the chef take it out of the oven and it sat on the counter for a few minutes before the waitress brought it over (she was busy with take-out orders, go figure) so it was only slightly warm by the time we got it. 

As for the rolls, the dragon roll (tempura shrimp, unagi, avocado & tobiko) was excellent! The California roll is a standard order for us, and we've had better. There was far too much avocado, (which overpowered the crab) and was a bit overripe. The lack of fresh avocado makes me wonder how fresh the fish is, but that's just speculation. Also, I would have liked more tobiko on top. Again, portion size was good, however it was unevenly cut and unevenly garnished. There was a general lack of attention to detail and I felt kind of rushed.

At the end of our meal, the waitress cleared away our plates without asking if we wanted to order anything else and the next time she came past our table she gave us our bill. We typically end our meal with a green tea ice cream, but we didn't really have an opportunity to ask if they have it (I didn't see any desserts on the menu). Speaking of our bill, I feel it was reasonable for the amount of food we received. We had a hot saki ($12.50) a beer ($6.50) about 12 pieces of nigiri, cali roll($6ish) and dragon roll ($13ish) for a total of $68.

Overall, a pleasant experience with good food. I won't go out of my way to return, but I wasn't disappointed either. If I'm in the neighborhood, I'd stop in for lunch but I won't return for dinner, as I look for a more cozy atmosphere. I think the phrase \"you get what what you pay for\" is applicable here."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch with hubby on good Friday. Service was good, we both got lunch combos and food came out fast. The miso soup was piping hot which is nice. I got the sushi and teriyaki combo, it came with 2 gyoza, salad 2 shrimp tempura, 3 California rolls, 4 nigiris and teriyaki chicken on rice along with the miso soup. It was very filling for $15.50. A good place in the neighborhood to get sushi."}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in Calgary.  We usually get it to go. It isn't a fancy place, and you won't get 100 different types of rolls or crazy dishes, but what they make is always fresh, and delicious.  The dragon roll is a must, and so too is the spicy tuna and avocado appetizer. Very friendly staff, and the price is reasonable.... I really wish sushi was cheaper, I'd eat it every day."}
{"text":"I like this place for take-out. I prefer not to eat in as management is not the most amicable to her staff and it makes for an uncomfortable eating environment. I can vouch for the sushi but not the cooked food, as I've eaten the latter.

I ordered the deluxe sushi combo for about $18.00. The rice is nicely seasoned but heavy on the wasabi. The fish is about double the size of the rice, as the rice itself is about bite size. The scallop was a bit fishy, but the salmon was buttery and smooth. 

I always order the dynamite combo for my husband ($12). The dynamite roll has two pieces of crispy battered shrimp, tobiko and avocado. Momo-Yama makes a way better dynamite roll than Gohan, and at almost half the cost."}
{"text":"Some of the freshest sushi that you can get in Calgary and probably the best spicy tuna rolls that I've ever had. Great friendly service too."}
{"text":"*4TH TIMES THE CHARM*

The first time I went to Momo-Yama Sushi I was turned away, because they were only taking reservations. The place was empty but yet they choose to send potential customers away? Never did seem to understand that...

So I toke there advice and called to make a reservation... the lady on the other end asked for \"how many\" when I said 2 she insisted you only need to make a reservation if it's 4 or more. So needless to say I can't come in for service off the street or make a reservation.... how silly!

The third time I walked by Momo-Yama's I was in the neighbourhood grocery shopping and thought... hey I'm hungry and craving Sushi... Japanese Restaurant across the parking lot (makes sense)- right?  - wrong!

Apparently their closed on Mondays.... SERIOUSLY! I'm beginning think it's personal.

Finally a fourth attempt to get into Momo-Yama was successful, I began to feel special like I finally made it into an elite club...  I was seated by the Sushi Bar.  Where all the cooking Magic happens. Except with the music, the chattering amongst employees and the Kitchen machinery I could barely relax or collect my thoughts. My friend and I began to dread the places noisy atmosphere. 

I ordered Miso Soup, Maki and Vegetable tempura.... the long wait was over! The presentation was average, the Maki Seaweed  was pealing apart and the Miso was so bland that drinking soap water would have been more appetizing!

I was completely disgruntled at the service, the food and the dingy crack in the wall restaurant that I assumed would behold some of Calgary's best Japanese food. Boy was I wrong!

It made Subway 2 stores over look like Fine dining- This place is a pass for me!"}
{"text":"I'm always a little hesitant about strip-mall sushi but this place is an exception. We popped in for a quick dinner on our way to an appointment and were very pleased. The service was great and the sushi was delicious. We'll be going back here the next time we want sushi."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't written a review for Momo-Yama yet!

I live just down the street so this is my go-to place when I'm craving some sort of Asian food. I'll sometimes call when I'm on my way home from somewhere (oh, ok - I call before I start the car!) and then pick it up. I've only actually eaten in once or twice. This place gets EXTREMELY busy and I highly suggest making reservations during peak times. 

The food is always delicious - I have yet to be disappointed. I usually get the chicken teryaki - it is probably bad but also so, so good. If you're eating in, you get it on a hot, sizzling plate... yum! There's only one guy making sushi (which can slow the process and occasionally they have to stop the sushi orders before they close for the night so that they can fill existing orders) but he does an excellent job. I wouldn't say it's the BEST sushi I've had in Calgary, but I've had worse for sure.

The staff can be a little abrupt, which throws people off but they are very nice & friendly. 

In  the area? Make a stop by. It's worth it."}
{"text":"I came in right at 5pm and was the only one in the place, I had written down my order from an on-line menu and the cost was going to be about $25 but when they added it up, every single thing had gone up a fair amount.

While I was waiting for my take-away order, some older woman came in and ordered and they served her before continuing with my order... I guess that is technically OK as she was an older grandmother type, but that may annoy some people who don't understand why this would be done.


The staff were friendly enough but they also messed up my order (either the waitress or the chef, I don't know) on an item and gave me some funky bean curd thing instead of the Tobiko roe I ordered... it was about 50 cent difference as bean curd was cheaper but I was charged the full $2.40 for the single piece. The snapper was also a bit old and dry, not bad, but not as fresh as it could be.

So the price was about $10 more than I expected and the quality was nothing special so I think their prices are a little higher than they should be... I'll probably not go back again soon as there are many sushi places in Calgary and have better prices or better quality"}
{"text":"Searching online for a sushi place for dinner we decided to try out Momo-Yama. Located in a strip mall the place is basically a square box and while not really that inviting looking they offered a good selection of Japanese appetizers, sushi, bento, teriyaki and don buris. We had a selection of sushi and a don buri and the food was delicious and the service attentive. While there were only a few people in the restaurant the place did a brisk takeout service."}
