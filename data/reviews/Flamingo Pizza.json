{"text":"Enjoyed the steak calzone!! Prices are very reasonable plus It's so near the strip, it's worth the try!"}
{"text":"They are in way over their head for taking groupon orders.  There are 8 people in the kitchen and still my order still not ready in 45 minutes! They even forgot 2 of my orders. And VERY rude cashier name Michelle, whom sounded like a man. Never again."}
{"text":"If nothing is open then decide to go here. Only tried there white pizza and it was alright. Anyways guy shoved all the extra condiments inside the pizza box which just ruined it for me bc it's like yo put in a small bag or hand it to me lol duh then it obviously gets messed up from being inside the box. Yea u suck u remember who U are lol"}
{"text":"I ordered food over 2 hours ago, with a 45-60 minute delivery window. My kids are starving. I've cancelled this order and am going out to eat. Normally I would feel bad, but then I saw all the Yelp reviews of people posting photos of bugs crawling around this place and all over the food. I think fate just kept my whole family from getting sick. Do not waste your time or money."}
{"text":"First off I went to this place because I thought the Groupon deal was really good. I wish I had never spent my money here.. I order my food and then proceed to pay,  then the girl working there takes my phone from me and redeems my Groupon,  then goes off and tells me that she has to push the redeem button herself because her boss looks at the camera and if I do it the Groupon won't be honored.  Anyways I order my food mozzarella sticks,  order of shrimp, 2 sodas, and 2 orders of chicken fettuccine alfredo and the Cashier proceeds to tell the cook my order laughing telling her they ordered your favorite food and then hear the cook complain about it. Mind you this place is so small me and my mom can hear everything they say. Then while we wait for our food the pizza delivery guy comes in and the Cashier,  cook, and him have a full blown conversation both cursing and taking really loud about beating their kids ass if the misbehave, i don't know if it's just me but this is just horrible customer service.  When I finally get my food 30 minutes later I'm waiting for my garlic bread and sodas.  I ask where my bread is and I see that the cook realizes she burned my bread(it was bound to happen with them talking)  and then say it will be right out (10 minutes later I get them) Then I ask about my sodas and the Cashier says she never charged me for them,  which was a lie because I saw her write it down when taking my order and charging me,  but since I had no receipt because they didn't give me any and it was her word against mine, I had to buy 2 more sodas which was $3.50!! So I start eating my chicken fettuccine alfredo and the food couldn't have tasted any planner,  it honestly had no flavor whatsoever.  My mom who eats almost anything didn't even like it!!... I'm writing this review to warn people not to go here. Save your money and go somewhere else.  Horrible customer service and horrible food was all I got when I came here.. And now reading some reviews now I know why my total was so high,  because they charge a Groupon tax!!! People avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and they called back and said it would be delivered 1.5 hours later.  It did arrive and it was cold.  I ordered a 2 Liter Coke and sausage and pepperoni.  They delivered 4 twelve ounce cans of coke and a cheese pizza.  2 liters of coke is equivalent to 5.6 cans of coke.  How convenient for them.  I called them and reported it and they said they would call me back and then never did.  The pizza was so bad I couldn't eat it.  I put the pizza and soda back into a bag and then  I delivered it back to their store which had a sign on the door which said it was under remodel.  Anyway I was able to get someone to the door.  I gave them back their pizza and soda and told them that they needed to credit back my money.  They just yessed me and no intention of making good on it.  I will help them by calling the credit card company.  Afterall I didn't sign anything so they have no proof of delivery.  Stay away from these scammers.  It is obvious that they are just taking advantage of tourists so they can provide lousy service since they are not counting on a repeat business.  Stay away from these delinquents."}
{"text":"The homie g gangster Alex brought me here, the pizza is dank and the service is good. Cured my munchies and I'll be coming back here for SURE. Also Alex is a butt pirate..."}
{"text":"Great pizza, and menu. Can't go wrong
Open late night and fast service !
It's  easy to find and friendly employees."}
{"text":"After driving all over, finally found this place. Upon walking in, I was hesitant because it smelled like there was a plumbing issue and the lady taking orders was 'weird' (I'll keep it at that). Suprisingly, the pizza and wings were great and the price wad decent. Came hot and was everything I asked for. I'd recommend! (4 stars for appearance issues)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Mexican taco pizza and it was probably the worst Mexican pizza I have ever had.  The cheese was in chunks and the flavor was not even close to any Mexican dish I have ever had. Should serve taco sauce with it."}
{"text":"Friendly service. You can smell the cooking dough as we wait for food. Ample amount of food service. Pizza here is hugeeee! Yummy yummy."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this place.  We had bacon pizza (delicious!), burgers (HUGE!), calzone (topped with garlic-so yummy!), and the flamingo deluxe pizza (mmm mmm).  We also had the jalapeño poppers and mozzarella sticks.  Everything was delicious and the service was very attentive."}
{"text":"Friendly and delicious food. Music is on point as well. They have a list of plenty of daily specials to choose from. Pizza was good and they also deliver."}
{"text":"I ordered a to-go meal from this restaurant on a Tuesday evening. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs, and was given plain spaghetti. Not the end of the world. But, on the salad that comes with the spaghetti, I discovered a fruit fly on a piece of lettuce near the bottom. Not worth the money for wrong/unclean."}
{"text":"Food was very greasy. Fries had so much oil that I threw them away. The wings were over fried and greasy too. Delivery was late.  I ended throwing away everything I ordered!"}
{"text":"The girl who answers the phone. Can't understand English. Refuse to put a manager on the phone and laughs the whole time. Great job on hiring her. Never again I will order or refer  this place to anyone. Your menu will be removed from our business."}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I decided to give this place a try for lunch because we work nearby. They deliver to nearby casino's which is a huge plus. We made a delivery order. We ordered a large supreme pizza and a side salad. 

Our food came within a reasonable about time just as we ordered. Everything was hot and fresh. I know this place has been given some bad reviews in the past but they are definitely worth a try. My coworkers and I will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"I traveled in Vegas and came in Flamingo pizza by accident. The lady was super nice and helped me order. And then I had THE best burger in the U.S. How could a pizza place make so delicious hamburger! And today I come a second time for the hamburger! I will leave tomorrow. I hope I can try out their pizza some day."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Great prices! Got 2 16\" pepperoni and they provide a good customer service! We be back!"}
{"text":"Deluxe pizza 18 inches and wings were amazing deal Fantastic customers Service, great food, and new owners that understand how to service their customers."}
{"text":"Nice little break from The Strip. Groupon brought us here and we weren't disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Cashier was extremely friendly and food was prepared and served to us quickly. Food was served hot and accurate however gyros needed more meat and the pizza fell apart. Cheese and veggies were cooked amazing but pizza bread is thin so everything slides right off. I also think the lobby needs a good deep cleaning."}
{"text":"Great service, friendly staff and good food at affordable prices! Came in with restaurant.com coupon card and was able to get my food at a discounted rate! Be sure to check out the deal on restaurant.com before stopping by!"}
{"text":"The pizza itself was okay, but it took 2 hours to arrive, was cold and when I called they lied twice saying it was out for delivery already. When it finally arrives the driver asked for his tip!!! Never again $65 for a late,cold pizza & wings"}
{"text":"Don't waste your money. The pizza was not good. They  also messed up on the ingredients. Ordered half sausage and get jalapeño peppers instead. The order taker even confirmed sausage. Pizza Hut would of been a better choice."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place doesn't even deserve one star.
Customer service was horrible & when we hung up not to deal with their attitude (especially when I'm about to drop $50 on one crappy pizza) he called me back FOUR times just to argue with me over how I wasn't going to pay $50 for his attitude sucked.
I don't mind spending money on food that isn't the problem, but the fact that he went out of his way to call me to argue over it is ridiculous.

I don't recommend this place because of their horrible attitudes."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled with the flyer under the door , it's not cheep and I would not feed this to my dog, nasty"}
{"text":"Flamingo pizza in under new management! The menu is still the same, the food is even better, and the owner is very involved in customer service. They are opened the crazy hours that normal restaurants would not be opened (great for those midnight cravings). I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
{"text":"They  advertise as the best pizza in Vegas and they really are... I had veggie pizza &  Greek salad and loved them. Everything was so fresh and tasty... You should also try Cannoli which was so good..."}
{"text":"This place is HORRIBLE! if I knew it would be this horrible I honestly would have gone to sleep hungry. I ordered a chicken Alfredo Pasta which had no taste at all, it had no sauce (ill attach the pictures) we also ordered the chicken scallopini  that claimed it had mushrooms (I didn't see one) and a chicken noodle soup that says in the menu it is \"homemade\" this was a Campbells chicken noodle soup can! In the picture you'll see, I poured it in a disposable bowl. The food was cold and tasteless. Do not buy from from this restaurant the food honestly is disgusting."}
{"text":"if i could give 1/2 a star or less i would.

i'm kind of regretting that i didn't read the reviews here first before ordering, something that i normally do. i was feeling under the weather today, and was not up for cooking or driving to get something to eat, so decided to place an order. the day before there was a flier attached to my door, after perusing through their menu, i decided to order a burger and a triple decker for the next day. after i place my order i was informed that the delivery charge was to be $5.00...5 bucks for delivery? are you kidding? when i asked them about this, they had the nerve to tell me that i was not in their delivery area, hence the inflated charge. i was astonished and told them, why bother putting up fliers in an area that is out of jurisdiction (obviously to gauge customers on delivery). as upset as i was, i ordered anyways as i was still not well. nearly 2 hours later, as i sit hungry, and calling several times to be told that the driver is en route, i finally called to tell them not to bother, because if it is taking him nearly an hour to get to me, i really don't want a cold burger and fries. of course, as i sit here writing this review, still hungry, and still unwell, the driver calls to tell me that he is at the gate...i laughed and told him to take it back, since i cancelled the order...my suggestion, find some place else to order, unless you know in advance that you'll be hungry for a cold pizza or burger 3 hours after ordering."}
{"text":"I stayed in Vegas for a few nights last weekend.  One day, I found a flier for Flamingo Pizza slipped under my hotel room door.  I kept it with me just in case and I'm glad I did.  After a day club on Friday, we took a long nap and were too tired to go to a sushi restaurant as we originally planned. So I decided to give this place a try (I didn't check Yelp reviews).

I was told that the delivery time was anywhere between an hour and an hour and 30 minutes.

The food arrived right on time. We ordered chicken wings, one Hawaiian pizza, and one Flamingo Deluxe with two additional toppings (pineapples and jalapenos). The food was good. The Flamingo Deluxe with pineapples and jalapenos was so good that I wish I ordered two of them instead of one and Hawaiian. The order also came with two small containers of Ranch dressing.

Although the food was good and it arrived right on time, I'm giving this place 3 stars because I had to go down to the lobby to grab my order. The delivery guy called me upon arrival and asked me to come meet him at the lobby to pick up the order. Ummmm...this wasn't my first time ordering pizzas for delivery and I've never ever had to get out of my house (or hotel room in this case) to pick up my order. I gave the delivery guy less tip than I planned. I don't know if it was the delivery guy or Flamingo Pizza's manager that made the \"customer comes to the lobby to pick up their food\" policy but I'll never order from this place again."}
{"text":"The service was amazing! Very nice couple. We had an 18 inch pizza, zucchini sticks, and wings. Portions are large and everything was delicious. We will be returning next time I'm Vegas! Check for a Groupon and definitely go for the larger option. You will want it!"}
{"text":"This place was a huge disappointment. We were excited to find a place that delivered super late. We ordered hot wings, but were delivered plain ones instead. The pizza was burned on the bottom but the veggies weren't cooked on top. Ugh...Never again. A wasted  $50. The delivery driver was very nice though. One star for him."}
{"text":"Terrible service and rude management. I waited an hour before i called asking about my pizza, the hostess said it will be ready in 10 minutes. (When did it start to take a hour+ to cook a 12in pizza?) Waited an half hour to call back the lady had a attitude now, said its on its away. Call back 20 minutes later, i said hello and she ended the call. Never got my order and wasted 2 hour+ of my time."}
{"text":"Can't vouch for dining-in or carry-out, but the delivery... What a joke.

7:12 PM: Placed an order for a small Hawaiian pie and 2 cans of Coke.

8:12 PM: Exactly an hour after I ordered a small pizza, I got a call from the delivery guy, who told me his car broke down. I asked him \"what happens now?\" and he said to call the shop back and sort it out with them. And so I did. I explained to them that their driver had broke down on his way and they said they'd call him to figure out what to do. I then explained that the driver just told me to call THEM. Ok, so the guy at the shop said they'd get another driver to deliver my pizza. No apology, no discount offer, no time estimate.

8:30 PM: Hanger escalates

8:45 PM: A half hour later the shop called me again just to tell me that another driver was on his way. They never told me if this was the original pizza or a freshly baked one.

9:00 PM: Hanger reaches Defcon 1 status

9:12 PM: Two hours after my original phone call, another delivery guy arrived with a cold pizza. After expressing my dissatisfaction with their service (and assuring him it was nothing personal), he suggested that I call the shop for a discount. They offered 4 dollars off of a $22 bill. I told him to take $10 or they can have the order back. The guy on the phone originally declined (are you kidding me??) but the classy delivery convinced them to agree. He didn't even want a tip. Nice delivery guy, but 90-minute old, room temperature pizza, douchebag staff. And it gave me the runs in the morning. Won't be ordering again. Won't be changing this review. Don't even ask me. I'm not flying back in from NYC just to PICK UP a free pizza.

Get your act together and do right by the customer next time."}
{"text":"Working in Las Vegas. Super tired, went back to hotel to have quiet night and ordered pizza. They told me one hour, took over two, and pizza was ice cold. Maybe just a busy night but it was Wednesday so I can't imagine how long they would take on a weekend. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Came to this place the other night and I will definitely be back. The pizza didn't take long to make, about 20 minutes, and it was very tasty. The cheese was nice and gooey and the staff were very helpful in choosing the right size pizza for our party."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to find that place! The pizza really delicious and perfect smell !! Delivery is fast. I got my pizza at late night and delivery guy is so nice! I love that service!!!"}
{"text":"So I ordered at 1152 and was told the wait time was 1 hour, ok. Called back at 1258 to check the status and was told that it had not been prepared yet so I told the lady on the phone I would like to cancel the order seeing that it had already been over a hour and my pizza wasn't even in the oven. I was put on hold, hung up on and had to call back. When I called back I was transferred to the cook who told me I couldn't cancel because my order was just put in the oven. I explained I didn't want the order anymore and received a lot of attitude.  I was told that I was unable to cancel the order because he had already made it and I should just except the fact that it takes time to make the pizza even though I tried to cancel prior to it being cooked. After he cussed me out and hung up on me I called back several times was placed on hold several times then was told  the pizza was on the way and that I should receive a call from the driver in four mins or less that was over 30 mins ago, still sitting here on yep taking my time to write this review and no call.  I work at a pizza place and would never in a million years recommended this place to anyone.  Typical Vegas attitude towards their customers, they act like they are doing me a favor to pay them for service.  Can't rate the product because I haven't received it going on two hours now. I am sure if it's anything like their customer service that it will be horrible.  Don't waste your time with this place it's an absolute joke. Still waiting for this magical pizza to arrive ?"}
{"text":"Back at it again! Can't get enough of their pizza. Angel helped us this time and was fast and polite. Got 2 \"16 cheese pizza and a Chicken Cesar salad this time. Still open late hours for all those late swing shifts peeps."}
{"text":"Ordering from this establishment was the most horrible experience!!! The order was completed over the phone at 8:40 pm, we were told it would be delivered from 1 hour- 1 hour 15 minutes.  We had not received our order over 2 hours later so we gave them a call and the woman on the phone advised us to give her 10 minutes to find the driver and our order and if he had not made it to us in 10 minutes to call her back and we did call back after we had not received our order 15 minutes later.  When we called back she was very rude and irate and asked us what we wanted to do because she did not know what happened to our order bc she had seen it leave the building and we were \"saying\" we did not receive it and now she was responsible for the order and they could not find the food or the driver and she would have to pay for our order out of her paycheck.  We told her that we were hungry and just wanted our order and she very rudely offered to make us a new order send it out and only waive the delivery fee but it would take 20 minutes to make and 10 or more to deliver.  The delivery guy finally showed up at about 11:30 pm with no apology.  We come here every year for WSOP and I will surely advise all of our associates not to ever do business with this place."}
{"text":"Flamingo Pizza was a great stop for late night cravings. The pizzas are phenomenal with their gooey cheese and crispy crust. I also ordered a calzone which was MASSIVE and a great portion for its pri ce. The staff was attentive and provided everything we needed.
I will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Further more, after Groupon/Yelp Eats contacted the owner about my experience. I finally received a phone call advising that he wanted to offer me a replacement pizza for the bad experience if I was willing to remove my post from Yelp. Further more, he sent a message to me on Yelp stating nothing I said was right. This owner clearly does not accept ownership nor responsibility regarding his employees poor and horrible customer service skills."}
{"text":"Hooked up to this place one of my local friends advise. Pizza was always good but to be honest it was looking dirty last couple times I've visited. But not this time. Last weekend I was gonna get their pick-up special. But when i get in the place things look different

And it looks like a new management in place. 
Fresh Paint, shiny floor, stylish counter and smiling faces, this place looks different...
It was an originally pick up but I had to wait a couple minutes for my pizza to get ready then we decided to stay and eat on-site with my wife...

Pizza was good as always.

Keep up the good work new management..."}
{"text":"I ordered 1 Meat Lovers Express pizza and 1 Mexican Taco pizza for delivery. Once delivered my friend and I took them to the kitchen and opened the boxes. We found that that both pizzas where lacking in toppings as if they where running out of topping and rather then saying that they could not make those 2 pizzas. They took what little toppings they had left and put them on the pizza and sent it out anyway."}
{"text":"So we rolled into town and needed dinner so we ordered their food with a flyer we received during check in... 

I called and ordered 2 pizza's and a large dinner salad and my time was 1 hour and 10 mins.  Plus I used their Yelp deal and checked in to get a free can of soda.  When I asked about it I was told that I couldn't use the checkin but I would need to order then review then call back so they could verify I reviewed and I would get a free two liter.  I said well never mind that's  a lot of work and he said don't worry I'll bring your \"can\".

Later, an hour and a half to be exact I hadn't received our order so I call back and was told it is in route.. 10 mins later the delivery man texts me says he's in lobby so apparently its delivery to the lobby not your room and I get my food.  No soda, no  Parmesan  cheese or red pepper flakes!  Then we get to the room and we get a tiny bit of dressing for a large dinner salad... Like minimal!! Plus the pizza wasn't great super basic and kinda cold... I wouldn't order again just saying..."}
{"text":"My husband enjoyed their pizza more than I did. I liked how soft their crust was... But I just found it sweet. This sweet flavor I could taste throughout the entire pizza and it just wasn't my favorite. Probably would not order from them
Again... But they were quick to deliver which was a nice surprise"}
{"text":"Don't even waste your time worst place!!!!!! very bad customer service food is disgusting I  waited an hour for two pizzas and hot wings when it got delivered they said it was fresh... Bullshit  it looks like it's been sitting for 3 hours!!!!! Would not even fix there mistake save ur money don't even come ......!!!!! I WOULD GIVE A ZERO STAR IF I COULD AND THEY HAVE ROACHES"}
{"text":"The food was pretty good! I really liked the cheeseburger!!!just wanna do it again! 
And delivery was fast and friendly. Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"This is horrible pizza. It was delivered cold, there was hardly any meat on a meat lovers pizza. The pizza had no sauce on it at all and I really wish I would have read the reviews before I ordered. They charge about $15 bucks for delivery on a $23 pizza. So, $38 for a really bad pizza. When you call to explain the problem, the place you on a perpetual hold."}
{"text":"Pretty good drunchies. Would recommend anyone that's drunk and loves pizza.open late night"}
{"text":"Messed up my oder and didnt wanna fixed it also over charge me. I order two pizzas and only got one but charged for both"}
{"text":"Unfortunately my roasted chicken I got was BBQ chicken I don't enjoy BBQ SAUCE so the drive gave me a discount. ..upon getting to my room I realized that the chicken was super burnt which made me believe that was why the BBQ SAUCE was applied. The calzone was good! Suck I couldn't enjoy the chicken  :("}
{"text":"Convenient location with a wide variety of menu items to satisfy everyone. They also have chicken picatta  available, even at 2 am in the morning. Definitely  coming  back to eat here."}
{"text":"I ordered a sausage pizza and Philly cheese steak sandwich.  The I saw the reviews and called and canceled the order.  The owner called back and asked why I decided to cancel.  I told him about the bad reviews.  The owner said they had just bought the business and to give him a chance to prove himself.  He said the food I ordered is almost ready and will arrive in less than 20 minutes.  We'll it arrived 10 minutes later.  The pizza was hot and delicious, so was the Philly cheese steak sandwich.  The fries that came with the sandwich was crispy outside and perfect.  I called the owner back to let him know the food was delicious.  He said they were trying hard to please and have hired new drivers.  My delivery guy was Miguel who was an older guy, not a high school kid.  I am in town for the CES 2018 show.  I'm from Illinois."}
{"text":"This place closes pretty late, pizza is good, I would recommend getting the 16in pepperoni but everything else is great also. Not that hard to find, should definitely stop by for pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese pizza and it was delicious! ! Quick and friendly service!! Loved every slice I had! Definitely a place I'd go back to!"}
{"text":"Food took over 2 hrs to get delivered. I had to call to see where my order was and was placed on hold multiple time. I will not reorder."}
{"text":"1hour later and the pizza still wasn't here after they said it would be 1 hour. I called about 10mins after that initial 1 hour and they said he was barely leaving. Ordered at 9:46pm and got it at 11:40pm almost 2 hours for a regular pepperoni and cheese pizza. So cold pizza for us. Just don't waste your time waiting. Go pick up yourself"}
{"text":"This place is shady, please don't get scammed and think twice before giving this place your business. My review isn't the first with this story, I actually just read one below with the exact same circumstance, and now I'm thinking this happens a lot. 

Short version: driver went to the wrong hotel, half my order was missing, called and said they'd deliver it, never came, called for a refund....twice, haven't been refunded and, after reading other reviews, I'm not expecting to be. 

Ordering was easy and I anticipated a heavy wait time considering it was dinner time, but I was pleasantly surprised when my driver quickly called to say he was down the street and would arrive any minute. I went downstairs and waited, no one there yet, but I figured there must be some traffic. I got a call from the driver and he was actually at a totally different hotel on the opposite end of the strip from where I was staying. Not sure what happened there, but the driver said he'd be at my hotel in about 20 minutes. He got there probably closer to 30-45 minutes later and apologized profusely. If that were the end of the problems I'd be ok with it. 

But, after receiving my order, I walked over to a bench nearby to make sure everything was there and realized half was missing just as the driver sped away. I called the restaurant immediately to let them know and they said that they'd get the other half right out to me. After waiting a couple of hours, it never arrived so I called and asked for a refund and they said they could do that and put me on hold. When they came back they said that they'd give the manager my phone number and they'd call me to issue the refund. 

That was on a Thursday. 

After not hearing back for three days, I called the following Monday morning and asked to speak to the manager. I was told he wasn't in. I asked when he might be back and they said he comes in at random times and no one really knows when he'll be back (as mentioned in another review)--MAJOR RED FLAG. He asked if he could help so I explained the situation and he seemed genuinely upset that this wasn't taken care of, saying he knew the person who was on when I placed my order, they'd get right on it, it's good I paid with a card and not cash because that's so simple, bla bla bla. I was feeling slightly optimistic until the guy was ready to hang up and I had to ask him if he needed my phone number, because how else was the manager supposed to find my order and call me back to issue the refund? Red flag #2. 

I'm still waiting for that phone call and a refund. Not going to hold my breath. This place is shady as hell. They're scamming customers. Please don't give them your money, they'll probably scam you like they did to myself and others."}
{"text":"Great pizza and staff very friendly. The price is great as well. It appears to be all hand made and fresh."}
{"text":"Close place to the strip! It has a lot of variety of pizza even ribs and roasted chicken. Also hot and cold sandwiches and even burgers! The staff is very friendly and they have great deals for a good price. I'd recommend eating here since they're open every single day!"}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER!!! Do not order from here or through grubhub or anywhere!!!! They will steal your money not give you the right pizzas or Order and never give you a refund. They will shut the doors soon because of all this fraud and shadiness!!!!! Mock my words. 
Lack honesty and integrity. Lie lie lie lie no manger no refund no proper products. Beware!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times but both the food and service on my most recent visit ensured I won't be back. I vaguely recall getting pizza at least once but it didn't make enough of an impression to leave a review. Ordered takeout wings for a VGK game night and they were dry - both in terms of being overcooked and barely sauced. 

I recently purchased a Groupon to use on a future visit but luckily saw some posted signage that basically invalidated the deal- Groupon is for takeout but they require that you be there in person to place your order (rather than by phone) with at least two people present, regardless of how many people you are ordering for or how much you spend. Who even does that? I figured a business with zero customers on a weekend with low ratings couldn't possibly be in a position to turn away business, but a staff member clarified that they would rather I get a refund from Groupon (and not come back at all) than come back and try to use it without following their arbitrary rules that contradict both the fine print AND common sense. Good luck with that."}
{"text":"This place had some good pizza, nothing to write home about but it got the job done after a night on the strip. They delivered to us at 4am and they had sizes big enough to feed a large party."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Great location friensly staff. Def recommd to anyone by the strip. Different sizes depends on how hungry you are and the mozzarella sticks were fantastic."}
{"text":"It was my first time here with my boyfriend and he and I loved it. He ordered the f-9 and I got the build your own. There was a bit of a wait but it was because there is a high demand for their food. People calling in for deliveries the whole time we were there :) very genuine and kind, humble people. Definitely recommend. :)"}
{"text":"Good looking pizza new fries nice owners nice groupon deal very fast service will for sure come back again"}
{"text":"Our order arrived at a reasonable time and I'm happy about that. But the pizza could've been cooked a lot longer, seasoned the wings better, and the cheese sticks could've had more flavor. Overall the service was great, it's just the food was dry and bland."}
{"text":"Please understand that this rating is not based on the food we were served. The food in and of itself was wonderful, and we would have gladly returned again and again despite it's small, inconvenient location. This rating is based solely on the temperature inside the pizzeria, and the conversation we were privy to during their very ill-timed staff meeting in the dining area. During this staff meeting we overheard conversations about a dirty microwave, dirty restroom that isn't  cleaned regularly, dirty fryer oil that smokes from lack of cleaning, up to and including a conversation about their roach problem and fumigation practices. There were disgruntled employees verbalizing their grievances, and an owner so frustrated that he cursed more than once. In addition to this conversation that we would have gladly gone without, we were subjected to very hot temperatures inside the dining room, where the only shaded area hosted the staff meeting that was taking place. This was also where the only small fan on the premises was located. Our food was so plentiful, and our table so small that we had to sit at a different table away from where our pizza was.  And while we sat there fanning ourselves with menus.... at no point did anyone ever offer us the more convenient, cooler seats in the corner where the staff meeting was taking place, that could have accommodated our entire purchase. Phenomenal food.... but sadly, a terrible experience. We will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Waited almost 2 hours. Called 3 times to get an ETA on my food. They kept saying that the food was on its way out each time. Cancelled my order but they were persistent on trying to deliver it. They said if I cancelled my order the driver would have to pay for it. Save yourself the time and don't order from here."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were looking for an off the strip more local experience in Vegas.  We found this gem and were so pleased with our service as well as the food.  Best fries I've ever had, and the pizza was outstanding!  It's a great ma and pa place with very little seating but this made the experience ever better!  I will be back on my next Vegas stay!"}
{"text":"They get 3 stars for delivering the correct pizza buy it took 2 hours and the pizza was cold. By the time I got it I was 5:48am I tolerated it because I'm in Las Vegas and I'm order in pizza at 3:30 am... Obviously I needed it."}
{"text":"What the hell?? It took 2 hours to get my order. The pizza was ok, but the clam stips were fried to a burnt chewy leather texture. And to top it off they gave me 12 ketchup packets for it, no cocktail sause, no tarter sause, just ketchup. Who wants ketchup on their clams?!?!?"}
{"text":"Best pizza place in Vegas drove all the way from Los Angeles. It's cheap and hot and crispy. The owner is very friendly and very helpful."}
{"text":"First time here i like it so clean place we ordered pepperoni pizza so delicious and salads so fresh service was so amazing ..... they so busy delivering can take time but worth it"}
{"text":"If I could give 0(zero) stars I would. As I was ordering my food I was placed on hold without notice. Was told 45 mins or less. An hour later I called to check on my order. Was told that I must of misheard and would be hour and 10 mins. They told me with lots of attitude \"u still have 10 mins left\". The food arrived at lobby 30 minutes later. Granted it takes 5 minutes from their place to our hotel(with traffic)They forget a part of the meal. When I call the driver he says he does not know about it. When I call the restaurant all I was told is that he would talk to the driver and never even bother to say I can send u another or refund partially for the mistake. The food was ok nothing great. (Pretty bad when u are starving) it is not at all convenient due to the horrible wait time and not to mention the rudeness of service. The restaurant never bothered to call back to see about my order that was not delivered. Please avoid this place. Find another pizzeria or eat something else. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!!!!! YOU WILL REGRET IT!"}
{"text":"Flamingo Pizza, just hit the spot.  EVERY SPOT.  Pizza crust was really good, and that's saying a lot coming from the guy who gives his crust to his fiancé!  The fries were crispy and well seasoned. Cool atmosphere.  A true pizzeria! What a hidden gem.  Try it and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Let's start with the good of this place, the pizza was good. Now with the bad, delivery means to the lobby, delivery said 60 minutes ended taking 1 hour and 40 minutes. The pizza was like coldish. I got an update at 12:17 that pizza was on its way and it was not here until 12:53. Almost 30 minutes later ! So my pizza was in the car just waiting for that long... I requested no olives on the deluxe pizza, and the pizza had olives... for two pizzas I was given two plates.. go figure... 

Would I order from this place again? Probably not. The pizza is not worth the time it takes to get here..."}
{"text":"Could they do a no star rating when it comes to the food here on Yelp? This place was disgusting! Put it mildly.
Cockroach scurried across the floor. The salt shaker coated in grime. No air condition. Hotter than hell.
Pizza was worse than a cheap ghetto one from the frozen section at Walmart. No oregano or basil or anything. Not even Parmesan cheese on the table to make it more palatable. Hot wings weren't \"hot\".
Cheeseburger was well, a cheeseburger. 
Had a Groupon and let me tell ya, the food they picture didn't come from here.
Never coming back to this place."}
{"text":"we never received our food. they confirmed multiple times on the phone that our order was on the way. we waited 2 hours. and when we called to cancel our order, we were then informed that our order was didn't gone through 2 hours ago. they LIED to bus on multiple phone calls, telling us that our food was on the way. then said that it wasn't their problem. TERRIBLE customer service."}
{"text":"If you are really hungry and looking for food to be delivered do NOT order from here. I ordered the Lasange, salad, garlic bread, cheesecake and a sprite, cost me $27 and certainty not worth the price or the wait. . It took 90+ mins to arrive and they forgot to send my salad. The delivery guy seemed really tired and irritated but I went ahead and tipped him anyway. I gave 2stars due to how late they deliver but I wont be ordering again."}
{"text":"wow the food is so good here wowowowow and the service is awesome i love the pizzaaaa"}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars but it wouldn't let me.i just ordered 2 PEPPERONI  pizzas for delivery...I got the wrong pizzas when they arrived. I called them back to tell them, lady said they would send over the right order and I have nothing to worry about....1 hour goes by and nothing. we called 4 times with nothing but apologies. When the guy finally  arrived he only gave us 1 pepperoni and told us to give  back 1 of the cheese and we can keep the cold one we had for over an hour...forgot to mention we ordered wings that where so salty we had to clean them off with a napkin before we can eat them....I always go here and because of this I will never ever go here again...BEWARE!!"}
{"text":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER!!!!
My boyfriend and I were staying at a hotel and saw a flyer near our door for this place so decided to order. The driver was the rudest person ever... personally called me and told me I did not tip him enough and demanded me to come down and give him more money. The only other cash I had was $100 bill and he told me to give him my card number so he can get more money and cussed me out as well. I was in tears...Half of the order was incorrect as well. I spent almost $75 for my order. I can't believe I was being harassed by a delivery driver... never am I going to order here again and I recommend you don't either."}
{"text":"After my first review, I was contacted by the new owners via a Yelp message. They read my \"unsatisfied\" review and asked me to stop by and pick up a free 16\" pizza, on them.

I called in to confirm this deal and was assisted by Jade. She is the wife of the owner, Fatih; she helps him with the online reviews. She told me to come by and was very friendly. We headed over to Chinatown; the shop is located at the edge of one of the big plazas off of Wynn. 

The shop is quaint; the paint was fresh and everything was clean for the most part. The owner came out to meet me and shook my hand. Jade also greeted me with a handshake and a smile. He immediately began to express his apology and he seemed truly genuine. He explained that he took over the shop about 5 months ago and they are still getting some of the logistics in order. I mentioned the confusion with their websites, and he explained that they are working with Google to get everything fixed. The previous owner must have dropped everything in their lap, with them to sort through the confusion. 

They offered me my pizza, it was hot and fresh. (I made sure to try it in the car while it was still fresh so I could get a better idea about the quality and flavors.) The crust was soft and fluffy. There were even some seasonings added - like basil and oregano - for increased taste. Overall, the ingredients were fresh. I am a pizza fanatic, so I will not say it was the BEST pizza in the whole WORLD. But I will say that for less than $10 in Chinatown, it is actually a very good deal. 

I recommend that you carry-out if you live far or if you think it will be a busy night - the pizza is best hot. I haven't tried the wings again; they were big, so that is a plus. 

Look, the truth is, this is a mom and pop place with new owners. It isn't perfect, and I think they are still working out the kinks. But if they are willing to reach out and make things better, they deserve the opportunity of your business. Very few places respond to Google or Yelp reviews, let alone offering to replace your meal or a free pie."}
{"text":"Flamingo's pizza is a great way to have a late night snack because they stay open until 6 am. I would like to recommend anyone of them because of the convenience."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would . WORST experience of my life . Driver not only gave my food away to someone else but he then proceeded to cuss at me saying how he's sorry he \"fucked up okay ?\" And when I called the place to tell them what horrible service I got they said \"you got your food back what's the problem ?\" DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE ! HORRIBLE !"}
{"text":"Not the worst pizza I've ever had but close! No sauce, sparse ingredients like hardly any at all. If I can count the pieces of sausage I think that's pretty disappointing. And the sausage was not good at all. Uneven pizza crust. It's not good pizza. About the worst I've ever had. Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Terrible. Food took an hour and a half to be delivered to my hotel.  The food was cold when it came. The spaghetti was dry, barely any sauce. Worst Italian food I have ever had."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting!!!! There was a flier left under our hotel door. My boyfriend placed his order but they came TWO hours later! The pizza guy had the nerve to ask my boyfriend if he could keep the change. The chicken fettuccine had a funny smell and tasted awful. And the pizza was terrible. It was damn near $40 for the nastiest food I ever had in my life."}
{"text":"Ugh. I was covering CES and had a ton of work to do in my hotel room, so instead of taking time to find a restaurant and wait for a table, I decided to order in. Flamingo had slipped a flier under my hotel room door, so I called. Mistake. While the woman who took my order and the guy who delivered my food were both very friendly, the food was pretty disappointing. The fried apps were all soggy and mushy when they arrived, and the Chicken Picatta was bland and flavorless. They were out of rice so I said fettuccine noodles were okay, but they brought sad, overcooked spaghetti noodles instead. The tiramisu was still frozen when I finished my meal and tasted it. The meal was supposed to come with a salad, but that was missing. And the \"2 liter bottle\" of soda I got was actually 355ml. Oh, and the garlic bread was flavorless and soggy. Basically, the only thing that didn't suck was the service (and the bottled water)."}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with not just the food but the service!! I have the lunch special Stromboli who's was perfect!  Lightly buttered the top with Parmesan cheese, came with a free sofa for $7.99. I was created multiple times during my stay making sure everything was ok. This is a hidden gem and I would highly recommend everyone to give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Wish I visited the reviews first before buying Groupon. Don't come here if you are about to watch a movie within an hour! Insane wait times! Didn't get to use all $40 since we didn't get the pasta dish because we had to leave to get to the theaters on time. AND the lady tried to pretend that she didn't forget the pasta order."}
{"text":"omg. fucking god. seriously, i am so damn fucking mad at this place. people, do not ever go or order. first, their service sucks. like legit. one of the workers is so impatient and rude. and i told them i was staying at paris hotel but, they delivered the pizza to different hotel. so i was fucking waiting for like an hr to get it. and guess what? it was so fucking cold and i still paid for it. then they later called me saying that they will give me 30% discount for the waiting and cold food. but, guess what again?, instead of taking 30% off, they raised the money. the total before was $34 and now my bank says $38. seriously? you wanna do this to me? i am so mad. this place doesnt even deserve a star. it deserves nothing. the price should have been $23.80 after the discount."}
{"text":"Looks like most of the newest reviews match my review right now.

Don't order from this place.

I ordered a double cheeseburger with a side of fries.

I ended up ordering the same, with two extra sides of fries (I like fries, what can I say?), and when they told me their minimum delivery order was $15, I added a can of soda.

Two hours later (and an hour after being told my order was being cooked), I got what I ordered.

The fries were pretty good, and the burger was actually good.

But, looking at their website in hindsight, their posted minimum delivery order is $10.  So, my burger and a soda would have met that requirement.

So, I spent $25 for something that I'd have spent $20 at my hotel for.

Not to mention, just like previous reviews... somehow, they find ways to slip their fliers underneath room doors they shouldn't even have access to (I've already sent an email to the hotel I stayed at this weekend with suggestions on how to prevent this in the future, since their front desk confirmed that they didn't put them under my door).

Needless to say... since I was literally about to order UberEats when this order arrived, and I didn't want to be a jerk about the whole thing, I accepted it, tipped, and moved on with my life... until reading these reviews and noticing how close they were to my own experience.

Looks like the Luxor doesn't like you guys, either.

Good luck."}
{"text":"Worst service ever 
9:10 order placed 10:30 called to see where are order is. Stated that it is on its way would be another 10 min. 11:00 called back proceeded to tell me that my order isn't even ready. They will say anything to keep you waiting so don't believe them."}
{"text":"Not sure how this place operates as an actual food operation. has to be a cover for something else. 
went in on a Friday night. understandably busy. All the things mentioned in previous reviews are true. They have several names the go by. place does not appear to be very clean. The owners dog dressed in full pizza attire. walks around in the kitchen and dinning room freely. When I inquired about my missing order. I was told \" no order\". I confirmed I put in an order pointed out the employee. She confirmed I orded. I found this odd. who comes up claiming to have an order they did not make? The place doesn't give out receipts so why would you question me? The large gentlemen then grabbed my appetizer from the freezer with his bare hand no gloves and dropped them in the fryer. I  was one of maybe 4 dinning room orders. it was hard to even get my order taken. woman at counter was to busy and tried to summon someone for my order. finally an employee on break comes and takes my order. we had a larger party order a personal pizza and some fried appetizers. larger table taken by employee. friends waited 45 mins for a 12 in pizza and 2 apps. I had to inquire about my food. The gentlemen in front of us, 45 mins for a burger. food looked generic. service crappy. place isn't clean. GO ANYWHERE ELSE THEY SHOULD NOT BE IN BUSINESS"}
{"text":"This is our first time here. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. Service is fast as well. Would recommend it for pizza-cravers."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum !!!! Must have great deals and delicious pizza. Oh my God and two dollar french fries this is amazing. plus we got a free soda for writing this review thanks flamingo pizza"}
{"text":"Horrible service we waited for 2 hours for a delivery before we ended up cancelling our order first attempt and last attempt at trying them."}
{"text":"These idiots have their flyer people out shoving menus through hotel room doors loud as hell at ridiculously late hours, like 10 PM - midnight. 

Not something I would do given the amount of gun happy people around here doing shady shit in motels late at night but hey, you do you Flamingo menu people"}
{"text":"Staying at the Hampton Flamingo Pizza's menu was on the desk and naturally I wasn't interested, Italian is best direct from the oven not being delivered; I was wrong.  On my last night in Vegas I decided 'why not' and ordered the cheese ravioli that came with a salad and garlic bread, my daughter ordered a Greek salad.  We were given a delivery time of one hour and exactly on the hour there was a knock at the door.

Well, man oh man am I sorry that I waited until the last night to try this place.  I was there on business for 11 days; what a miss.

The salad was really fresh, not bag-o-salad or wilted stuff, the salad was amazing.  Such crunch and so much for a side salad!  My daughters Greek salad was great and she couldn't finish it.

The Marinara sauce on the cheese ravioli actually had flavor and the ravioli were large, filled and flavorful.  I will be in town again in January, this time there will be zero hesitation when ordering in!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else, my review is going to cover how this place is run by garbage management and was disappointing from start to finish.  

I'm a patient woman, so when I placed an order on a Saturday night, I knew it was going to take a while.  1.5 hours is nbd.  But two minutes past the \"latest they'll get there\", when I hadn't heard anything, I called to check on my order and it was \"on the way\"  It did indeed arrive a few minutes later.  

Half of my order was missing - and because it was already so late and the poor delivery driver was clearly very busy (and polite!) I declined his offer to go back and get my missing items.  I decided to call for a refund.  

When I called the person promised she would put a note on the manager's desk to refund my items that I didn't receive.  I also let her know that one of my pizza that did arrive had ONE CUT into the pizza that only went halfway through.  i.e. it wasn't sliced.  Literally, there was 1 cut halfway through the pizza and that's it.  Absurd!

After 10 business days, when I didn't see a refund, I called the business, and the real shenanigans started.  I have called 6 times since then, each time, they tell me to call at a different time because the manager isn't in.  I've called at 11 am, at 8 pm, at 5 pm, all times that the person on the phone recommended because the \"manager is only in when we open\" or \"the manager only comes in at 8 to pick up the money bag.\"  RIDICULOUS.  It is a month and a half later, I Don't have my refund, and the only way I can get it...per the suggestion of an employee, is to dispute the charge with my bank.  Same employee also suggested I \"swoop in\" between 11 and 2 when the managers are there so they can't dodge me anymore.  That is CRAZY that I would have to do that.  

To top it all off...the pizza isn't very good.  Pizza Hut was 100% better in all ways than this business run by jerkwads.  I will never recommend them, I will post this review everywhere, and I will tell all my coworkers on business travel to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"We cam by here on our Vegas vacation and thought it was a cool spot. Nice pizza joint that's neat the strip but doesn't have crazy prices. We'll surely be back again."}
{"text":"1 hour and 15 min.  Soggy fries and cold pizza.  Delivery guy  leaves the food on top of a damn trashcan and doesnt even hand it to me. Ubering people when delivering. F'd up! 36 bucks down the drain"}
{"text":"We were not sure what to expect. It is a small little spot with just a tiny dining area, mainly because they do a lot of delivery. However, we were so glad we stopped by! The food was very good! The pizza was huge, we ordered the 24\"! Wings were crisp, the only way I like them, flavorful and plenty. They had a lot of meat on them too! Service was great as well. Despite being very busy we did not feel rushed in any way. They ensured we were taken care of and had everything we needed. The dining area was quiet and perfect for our group of 5 and there were a couple tables outside if you wished to sit there. I am so glad that they were open late. It was very convenient and perfect for feeding five, three being teenage boys!!
Definitely, recommend and would revisit next time we are in Vegas.

Also, note that we did use a Groupon which worked out well but you cannot use it on the specials or meal deals/packages. You do have to order everything separately. Which is not too bad I would use it again."}
{"text":"This place wanted a my girlfriend to send a personal text with her iD and credit card. Don't order food . It's fraud"}
{"text":"Called 40 minutes after my order to find out my card declined. They lied and said called my phone and rom number.  Waited an hour just for them to lie about calling and say nothing was on the way."}
{"text":"I picked this palce as a late night snack for the kids specifically because it was .6 miles away from my house. Nevertheless we all waited close to two hrs for our food. And the taste by the time it arrived was not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great customer service and really enjoyed decor if visiting or live in Las Vegas definite recommend"}
{"text":"Last night I decided to buy The Flamingo Pizza but now I regret doing it. First of all they messed up the whole order, like we asked for a Xtra Large cheese pizza and they gave us a hot sauce, pineapple pizza & we didn't realize until we took a bite. We ended up calling the pizza man back, letting him know that we got the wrong pizza. We gave him back the pizza that was the wrong one but he ended up taking 4 slices, using his hands, from our pizza to the pizza we gave back to make it a whole one and deliver it to the other people. So in other words our pizza got the 4 slices off of it because we took pieces from the other one. Meanwhile he used his bare hands to touch the pizza. This is just all sorts of wrong and definitely violating the health codes. They wouldn't give us a refund till we walked there and waited an hour and a half and didn't refund the whole order. Meanwhile we didn't even eat everything we took minimal bites and got sick. We even have a brief video of the pizza getting transferred. I RECOMMEND NO ONE EATING HERE EVER!! AND IF THERE WAS AN OPTION OF 0 STARS THATS WHAT THIS PLACE WOULD BE!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible customer service. Received a flyer on my door Today... And thought I'd give them a try, always interested in trying new places. The first call I was hung up on... Giving the benefit of the doubt I called back. They never identified the business... And went straight to asking\"where is this going\" preceded to provide the address and this woman asked \"ok where is this going\". I was done hung up and went straight back to tried and true Angelinas.   Given the prior reviews, which I hadn't checked prior, I understand."}
{"text":"I'm still waiting on my refund. Its been 2 months lol I don't expect it to ever come back to me ever!!!! This is so dissapointing because they used to be so great at everything and now I feel like everyone must be high and unhappy."}
{"text":"Don't order from here!

Gluten free pizza could break a tooth! And the regular pizza taste like a frozen pizza. AND it took 2 hours before it was delivered!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst food I've ever tasted in my entire life! Do not eat here! McDonald's dollar menu has better food and service than these people. Waited two hours for my order to arrive and when we opened the food and started eating the chicken Alfredo was rotten. After one bite I had to spit out the food and thought that vomit would have actually tasted better than this alferdo. When we called the restaraunt they refused to settle the problem efficiently. You live and you learn but I will definitely NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN!"}
{"text":"We tried Flamingo pizza because I had a groupon, but wish I hadn't wasted the time or money. The place was dirty, the table next to ours had a bug scurry across the windowsill. 

We had the white pizza and it was under seasoned and the crust was flavorless. The service was poor considering the number of people that appeared to be working. I had to point out in the menu where the clam strips were located. It wasn't a good experience and we won't be making a return visit."}
{"text":"The food is really good. I've tried pasta, pizza, blt sandwich, & brownies. 
Would be 4 or 5 stars but they take forever to deliver and the guy who delivers food sucks (don't know his name). 

Took an hour & half each time I've ordered. 

I had the same delivery driver and he just parks outside my condo and stands by his car I have to call him to come to the door. When he comes he doesn't say anything or smile, he's just very rude for no reason. He has an accent and looks like he's in his 30's... so ask him why his customer service sucks because it makes me not want to eat here."}
{"text":"Very slow service. Told an hour took 2 hours and pizza cold.  Pizza just ok.  I would not order again."}
{"text":"I give them 2 stars because the lady was really nice however the Chicken Alfredo was very very nasty. I do not recommend, however I have had their cheesesteak and that was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and it took two hours. When we did get our food it was missing three items. I called to tell them and had to talk to three different people to get it straight. It's been an hour and we still haven't received our missing food."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. DO NOT COME HERE! Made an order late at night and I finally get it 2.5hrs later (wasn't even a big order, literally just spaghetti and meatballs). At this point we had already fallen asleep but the food arrived and we tipped the driver. The food itself was inedible, it was cold and soggy as hell. This happened about 2 days ago and I've been trying to reach a manager since then but all the employees I call keep telling me to call at different times, either in the morning, later in the afternoon, or at like 5-6pm when the manager comes in. Each time I call, the manager is never in and after reading these other reviews it seems that they are just dodging my calls. What's even more ridiculous is that there's no customer service number or anything online to contact anybody about this atrocious business and its' despicable management that never seems to be around. Do yourselves a favor and stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Huge portions. Best pizza and calzone I had. Amazing prices. Open super late so its perfect for a late night craving. They deliver mostly but you can also do dine in. Go here!! Its our new favorite. We won't choose anywhere else"}
{"text":"This was very bad. The garlic bread was not baked. They just put on the spread and stuck it in foil. The baked beans looked terrible.The wife tasted them then threw them out. The ribs had no taste at all. We ordered two liter coke and they delivered two cans of coke. They forgot to bring our salad. When they returned with the salad they had a two liter Pepsi instead of coke. The pizza was okay."}
{"text":"YOU SUCK!!! Ordered just two pizzas last night... Instead received one pizza, cold zucchini fries, some weird pasta s**t and a BLT?!? All two hours after ordering!!

Called three times after the first hour and every time it sounded like it was an inconvenience for them to answer my call. Without even giving my name I was told \"it's coming!\" ... Hmm you don't even know what I ordered?

Bad service, Really bad food.... Don't order from here!!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Ordered a pizza through yelp24 and not only did it take almost 2 hours to recieve when the estimate was only 45-60 mins but it was also the wrong pizza and cold. Don't order from this place unless you like wasting money. I've never had any problems ordering from other places so take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"So we purchased a Groupon because we like to try new places & we like to support small, local businesses, but this is not one to support.  First of all, parking at this place is horrible especially on a Friday night.  The Groupon was dine-in only, we walk in to see a total of 6 tables, 4 that seated 2 people and 2 that seated 4 people, obviously this place doesn't get a lot of dine-in customers! We were there on a fairly cool night in Vegas, in one corner of the \"dining area\" the front door was propped open & in the other corner, a large utility fan was running at full blast....how inviting! We were quickly told that anything that said special on the menu could not be purchased with the Groupon, no problem. We ordered a pizza with extra cheese, mozzarella sticks, a Diet Coke and a water. While we were waiting, the conversation between the staff was completely unsavory, every other word was the 4 letter f-bomb, I'm fairly open minded, but wow! Once the Lord's name was taken in vain, I about jumped out of my skin! Okay to the food, we got a can of Diet Coke, it had dirt & what appeared to be cigarette ashes on the top, a bottle of water & our mozzarella sticks with some cheap paper plates. The sticks were good. Then comes the pizza..... they seriously set the pizza box on your little 2 seater table & walk away! The crust was the equivalent of copy paper.  Obviously, the ovens are not balanced because one side was done & the other was still gooey & raw, pretty difficult with that thin of crust! It was okay, but by the time we got it my blood was boiling due to the horrible atmosphere, constant swearing & freezing from the air blowing in. I definitely would not recommend this place, nor will I ever eat here again!"}
{"text":"Flamingo pizza ... I have to say I've had past experiences with them that weren't impressive . Giving them a second chance I am more then happy about the decision I made  to go back . Under new management , the customer service was outstanding Rebecca & angel were fantastic . I told them about why I hadn't been in awhile and they reinsured me I wouldn't be disappointed with my present & future visits ( I like the confidence in the future visits they predicted ) . Ordering the \"anytime\" special @ $27.99 +tax which included a 16\" inch pizza , ( pepperoni ) 18 chicken wings & a 2 littler of soda for 3 of us made for the perfect dinner , not only was our pizza fresh & hot it was made to perfection the wings were outstanding !! The atmosphere appeared to be updated & cleaner . I was giving the opportunity to meet the new owner \"Fatih\" who was kind enough to send us out dessert on the house . We went with the cheesecake after giving the choice between that or chocolate brownies . Thank you for going above and beyond flamingo pizza for bringing are business back , great customer service and a fresh , hot Quality pizza !!! I'm excited to say \" Rebecca\" & \"angel\"  , my friends & I will be back for a future visit again & again Good job & 5 stars deserved"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good I was super suprized. We only waited 10 minutes for a 7 dollar 16 inch pizza. :) plus the ranch was good and that's a super big thing with me!"}
{"text":"Pizza was ok. Big combo was horrible; it was extremely greasy and overcooked. The mozzarella sticks didn't even have cheese in them."}
{"text":"Our order took over two hours to arrive.  Not only was our order late, most of the food was horrible. The only thing that was good was the side salad.

The pasta was bland. The chicken wings were too. It might have been ok if we had some hot sauce, or even salt and pepper??

So, if you decide to order from this place, I have two words for you \"side salad\"."}
{"text":"I gave it 1 star because 0 wasn't an option. Disgusting! We were looking at the menu and watched several roaches walking on the wall. Dead flies in the window.. Absolutely disgusting. I obviously didn't stay and eat so I can't comment on the food, I can only speculate that it's disgusting as well. The good news is that I'm nauseous from the experience,  and I'm no longer hungry so I'm saving a ton of calories. A little consolation prize."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time and I can say that the food was pretty decent. I ordered the honey dipped chicken with French fries. The honey dipped chicken, came with 4 pieces of chicken: 1 breast, 1 thigh, 1 wing, and 1 leg. The pieces were kind of small, especially the wing and leg. This also comes with French fries, a small container of baked beans and 2 pieces of garlic bread. I was a little upset that the item doesn't mention everything that it came with, so I ended up having 2 orders of French fries.

For the food itself, the chicken had a nice taste to it, but it was a little overcooked. The baked beans were good, you get about 2 tablespoons of baked beans, and the 2 pieces of garlic bread were really just 2 pieces of sub bread with some garlic butter spread. The bread would've been better, if it was toasted after the spread was put on, instead of being soft and almost soggy. I give this a 4 star review, due to the combo, the taste and the availabity. If the portions were a little bigger and cooked a little better, it would be worth the 5 stars. They were open late, and that was a plus."}
{"text":"This spot is a hole in the wall kind of place .More suitable for just deliveries and not for a sit down meal.Staff is not friendly at all . they want to get you in and out as quick a possible .Because it is not welcoming the  chairs and table feel very uncomfortable.It felt as if I was a unwelcome  guest in a unknown place.Pizza was ok though .This sure convinced me. Customer service is truly very important."}
{"text":"After reading some of the terrible reviews I was a little concerned about grabbing food from here. Glad to say almost all of them are wrong. The food was on point. My fiance and I loved everything we ordered. I didn't realize how far away we were from the location when we ordered delivery (about 20 mins) however the staff was super accommodating and delivered to us anyway, even got a phone call from a gentlemen who was very pleasant to confirm my order. Price point is a touch high from what I was used to however this is Vegas and is comparable to everything else. Definitely would order again!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular customer at flamingo pizza for 3 years and they've never disappointed me. I regularly go there for chicken wings and fries during lunch (they're my favorite). They always remember my order and have been good to me from the start. 

They've changed over the years and is now under new management. Which I have no complain about since the place got a new look and feels more fresh. They seem more organized now and I think the new boss knows what he is doing. 

For a small pizzeria it's not too shabby. They open until very late so it's perfect for late night munchies  they don't as enough credit as they should. there should be more people checking this place out."}
{"text":"After being up all night we went to grab their combo deal for $30. What a deal! We got a little of everything; pizza, garlic bread, beans, soda and a whole slab of ribs!It happily fed four of us :)"}
{"text":"What a joke. Place a delivery order, 2.5 hours and two phone calls later, a delivery driver shows up with pizza to tell me that they do not accept cards. Way to waste my time, Flamingo Pizza.

No idea if the food is even decent, took over 2.5 hours to get to me on a weeknight."}
{"text":"The worst pizza I've ever had. Took 2 hours to get to the hotel and it was cold. This place is a joke"}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon for my boys and I to have a lunch out. It was wonderful. The garlic chicken wings are amazing and the pizza is delicious. We'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"I thought the service and food here was pretty good. Im gettinf the veggie calzones and cant wait to just grub down. Highly recommended as its fairly close to where the strip is so good access to everything."}
{"text":"I purchased a Groupon for this place, beware Groupon  states good for dine in or carryout. The person at the counter said it's for dine in ONLY. Flamingo Pizza should read the fine print, like I did and the deal also does not say for how many people it is for."}
{"text":"I love quick service!
Ordered cheese burger w/ onion rings to go.
The food came out in less than 5 min! I was happy because I was in a rush.
The burger was juicy and delicious ;-)
Great place to grab a bite if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointed. Ordered delivery and all the food was cold after it took over an hour to arrive. No marinara sauce came with the mozzarella sticks and pizza was overpriced for the quality. The worst part was I ordered the Chicken Fettuccini Alfredo and the Alfredo sauce was straight soup and had zero flavor. I was left completely unsatisfied with everything we ordered and felt like I got ripped off on this entire order. I'm giving them an extra star only because they're open really late."}
{"text":"Decent pizza for late night munchies . Can't really complain everything will taste better with some booze . Came here around like 1 am surprisingly still open and got 2 pepperoni  pizzas. A bit to much bread for me but appreciate they opened late . Price was about 7-8$ a slice ."}
{"text":"Pizza was cold and dry, made with poor quality ingredients. Wings were broken; it is like they got a bunch of reject wings from supplier. Tiramisu was frozen and tasted nothing like it should. Stay away."}
{"text":"First time ordering with EAT24 app. Unfortunately it was the worst. 2AM Vegas after party meals are very important. If you promise delivery time between 45-60 min window, it's very important you do your best to honor that. If you are running late, it's also very important to notify your customer you're running behind schedule. We waited for 2 hours and EAT24 via restaurant could not locate the driver. I give props to EAT24 customer service for trying her best, but restaurants like this are not ready for additional orders coming in using this system. Going to bed hungry."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. I came here because I wanted pizza and this was the closes one to us that was opened. I ordered pizza and pasta. After getting cashed out, the cashier gave me an estimated time of 20-30 minutes. I did not receive my food until after an hour. I don't understand why the food was talking so long. I've been to a pizza place and seen how busy it gets but never have I ever wait this long for a take out at a pizza place that clearly was not busy at all. People are rude. Customer service is horrible. No one cares about getting your order on time. There are roaches running as round on the floor. No one is wearing a hair net and apparently good hygeine is optional here. Never come to this place ever. I've never given any place a bad review but this had to be done. If I could give this place a 0 I would. They also don't give refunds because unfortunately the manager doesn't have the \"code\" to give out refunds. He didn't even have the common courtesy to let me know that my order was going to take longer than he quoted. Will never come back here ever again."}
{"text":"After a long ride to Vegas we were hungry and wanted something that would be easy and convenient. The flyer for this pizza place was on the door of our hotel room. We called them and ordered one of their speciality deals. It was a pepperoni pizza and wings. The quote time was about 60-75 mins, which was ok because we wanted to get ready anyways. We received the pizza after TWO hours of waiting! By that time we were starving...then we get ready to eat it and it's super COLD! After 2 hours of waiting we were furious. We called and spoke to someone about it and was told that she would call the driver and call us back. After 20 minutes we called back and she gave us an attitude saying \"yes I know you just called I haven't called my driver yet it has only been 5 minutes\" so I hung up and never received a call. All in all customer service was terrible, pizza was cold, and after warming it up the microwave food was still not very good. Our advice STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE AND DON'T ORDER FROM FLYER YOU FIND IN HOTEL ROOMS!"}
{"text":"Bought. A groupon for this place cashier literally was like bam bam bam coming from Cali left me with an impressive memory to tell at home  a must come"}
{"text":"One word \"disgusting\"should of known when I walked in...the place was a dirty dump! And the pizza even worst. ..went home thinking oh my God in a place like that I could be biting into a fried rat instead of chicken wings. ..beware people after that pizza I wouldn't dare go back and eat this garbage if you played me...disgusting !"}
{"text":"So I loved this place before... ordered numerous times, but the last two times I've ordered the pizza is just not the same, last time I was just thinking oh it's just an off visit, but no this time was the same cheaply made pizza. I don't know if they have changed the dough,sauce, and/or cheese but it just doesn't take the same. Gave 3 stars just because the lady at the front was nice. The pizza was worth the price before, but over priced for the quality now."}
{"text":"I feel like an idiot. I would have saved money and had much tastier food if I had went out, anywhere! But I thought that since I waited till 9:55pm to decide what to eat, I should just get delivery. Plus I wanted to be in bed by 11 but that's for sure not happening. Ugh when I called to place a order she said a hour or less. What a lie! 
This place sucks. 
Save your time,money and taste buds and do not get delivery!"}
{"text":"Called for delivery because we got a flyer underneath the door of our hotel (on the Strip) when we checked in around 1 a.m. I ordered pasta with meat sauce and honey chicken wings. 

The lady taking my phone order was nice but didn't tell me my wait time so I had to call back. Wait time was 1 hour and 30 minutes for delivery!! Our food took that long to come. Also, they don't come up to the rooms, you have to meet them downstairs. 

The guy delivering our food wasn't wearing a uniform, it was just a regular guy. The food was spilling in our bag, my noodles were clumped together, and the chicken had no sauce or anything (when it was supposed to be honey flavored). 

Never order from this place for delivery! Horrible."}
{"text":"Stayed at a suite at the Hilton Grand Vacation by stratosphere. They were slipping their menu's under all the doors, and there was no room service menu so we decided to order some pizza around 8:00-8:30. Ordered the #10 which was two pizzas, 36 wings, and a 2-liter. After an hour and a half I called to check on our order. The girl that answered asked me to hold when I told her I ordered an hour and a half ago. Then she picked up the phone again and forgot I was on hold, told me the delivery would be out shortly. I figured that maybe it was a busy night so not too upset about the wait until the food finally arrived about 15 minutes after the phone call. Both pizzas were cold. Crust was like cardboard, cheese like plastic. Barely any toppings on pizza. Ordered BBQ wings, and they basically cooked some plain wings and put a few squirts of BBQ sauce on them. Not tossed or anything. This combo was $61.99, I recommend just about any other pizza place over this. Pizza Hut, dominos, papa john's, little Caesar's, Costco, digorno, hot pockets... not worth the $, save yourself."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good. I ordered the Special. 18inch pizza with 2 toppings. I asked for pepperoni and sausage. I could barely find any toppings. For the money they're better places to eat pizza. I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Great service and food is delicious!!!!! The calzone was amazing and the salad was very fresh.... :)"}
{"text":"After reading the first review I noticed they didn't mention how the pizza was so, like an idiot, I ordered from there tonight. What a mistake. You would pretty much HAVE to be drunk to like this garbage. First, it arrived cold. And I only live around the corner. It tasted as if it had been sitting around for awhile. Even after warming it up (that's how cold it was) it tasted like crap. So, here I am, having spent my dinner money and I'm hungry. Threw the whole thing where it belongs. . .in the garbage. Why didn't I just call Napoli like I usually do? Like I said, I'm an idiot."}
{"text":"Pros: Delivery was fast, Ranch was good, open late. 

Cons: Pizza was not good....cardboard crust. And expensive. 

Do yourself a favor and just order from a chain pizza place."}
{"text":"Super bad experience with the quality of food. After reading some of these reviews posted on Yelp I am convinced that they were left by friends or family of existing employees. It is a pizza place in the middle of a  Chinatown, that should have been my first clue. Nevertheless I am curious and exploring new options I went there ordered 16 inch pizza with 20 wings. 

The price was bad at $29.99, keep in mind when I looked at my pizza it seemed like they were short on pepperoni and used an excessive amount of dough. I ordered mild and hot wings they look like they were almost plain they were stingy on the sauce I guess. I also ordered two sides of ranch that were the smallest cups I have ever seen I was very disappointed they charged me $0.50 for each one. Even knowing that I was unsure of my purchase before I paid I still continued what's the worst that could happen. 

After being dissatisfied when eating the pizza I said I will never go there again. Hour and a half later feeling a terrible stomach pain beginning to think this place was a bad choice once again. Just warning you guys who are curious and exploring new places this place is not a New York style pizza like other fake reviews claim. This is one of the lowest quality pizzas I have ever tasted. 

People you have been warned.....

Ps. To the staff that will hopefully read this review. Please step up the quality of your dough remember that less cheese and less pepperoni doesn't  mean savings, it means crappy Pizza."}
{"text":"First time ordering and loved it! The lady over the phone was nice and she said my order would take an hour but came in waaay earlier than expected. The food is great! Planning on ordering again soon. :)"}
{"text":"Ordered 12\" veggie pizza 
French fries
Flamingo F-9 
~$40

Very easy place to access on the corner in chinatown, although parking is limited on a Friday night. You might want to park in the other side by 99 ranch. 
When we first entered there was no greeting with the four workers behind the counter. The menu by the counter just showed pictures with no sizing or prices listed. Only once we tried to seat ourselves did some guy with glasses yelled \"hey you ready to order?!\" I had to grab a menu off the tables to see what exactly they offered. Between ordering I wanted to check in on yelp and I was offered a free soda, but the guy didn't believe me and wanted me to leave a review before getting my free soda. Then the lady yells my name is Irene like I'm suppose to give her a nice review when she didn't even acknowledge or bother to help in the first place.
You could tell this place was struggling by the calzone tasting like a plain hot sandwich with no sauce according to my dinner date, he had to ask for marinara sauce and suggested he minus well just go to subway.
Literally watched a whole episode of vampire diaries on the TV while waiting for our order lol. 
If youre okay with the place being cold and not much heat this is the place to be."}
{"text":"SHADY! Dont go to this dishonest business! I bought a Groupon and when I tried to use it they charged me from a different menu that isn't posted anywhere (higher prices than online and their carry out menus) so it came out to no discount at all it was $29 total for a 12 inch pizza and 5 mozzarella sticks.  The food wasn't even that great! Pizza was decent but mozzarella sticks were not good! Rip off!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here earlier and was told by the rude operator that my food would come in an hour which I was fine with. When she read me back my number back I noticed that she got it wrong and tried to correct it but was hung up on. So then I called back to confirm my number to which she then rushed me off the phone while assuring me that she had my number. Keep that in mind.
So not only did my food come an hour and twenty minutes late when I tried to cancel prior to getting my food when it was just  an hour late the rude operator hung up on me twice without giving me my refund. She said I'd be charged anyway for their terrible service effectively stealing my money. The icing on the cake is that the delivery women finally called me after being an hour and twenty minutes late and told me that she didn't have the right number. Then when I got downstairs the food was ice cold. The delivery woman knew she was an hour late and still expected a tip. Them was mad when I rightfully refused to do so. I should have expected that beforehand because by then I already knew I was dealing with an unprofessional establishment. 
Do not, I repeat DO NOT, order from the horrific establishment. They are frauds and thieves who operate without knowing the meaning of the word costumer service and do not deserve anyone's patronage. And apparently most of the other yelpers who have encountered these charlatans agree with me.
I wish ruin upon this criminal establishment."}
{"text":"Sucks! This place is horrible, flavorless pizza, people are so slow. To many bums. The lady wrote our order down wrong but repeated it correctly to us. Doesn't make sense, they had attitude which got annoying real fast. Took 30 min to get a cup of water"}
{"text":"Waited for 2 1/2 for delivery. Tried to cancel, but driver finally showed up just as I was walking to the food court in the hotel. Driver said she had just jumped on all night & needed to get another f*@%ing job....I agreed!! Food was mediocre, but certainly not worth the wait!! Would give 1/2 star if I could!"}
{"text":"Place is horrible , simply said.
Waited over an 2 hours for food that came lukewarm and tasted less than mediocre.
Never again save yourself the time.
wish I could give 0 stars.
Avoid at all cost 
Slow and taste not worth half of the wait time lmao"}
{"text":"Very meh pizza and horrible customer service. Ordered a Meat Lovers Pizza and a Crispy Chicken Salad. Delivery took an hour and 30 min. Would have been nice to know that their order times were running long. When the food finally came, we noticed that the dressing for the salad was no where to be seen. I called back to complain and the lady answering the phones really could have cared less. She said they'd send it out \"if\" they delivered in the area again. It's been several hours now and no call. What's the point of eating a salad without dressing?  How can anyone think it would be acceptable and not offer even a partial refund? The pizza itself was also very meh... the meat lovers was a little sparse in the meat department. I went so far as to complain to the hotel lobby where I was staying at since I found the menu in my room and they told me that they have been calling the police on this place since they have people trespassing on their property to shove menus under the door. STAY AWAY!"}

{"text":"Not only was the service completely awful but the pizza was disgusting. We tried them because they slipped a menu under our room door at Tahiti Village (timeshare) and thought it would be easy plus they offer gluten free. We placed the order at 6:00 and were told an hour for delivery. 45 minutes later, my brother realized he forgot to order salad so he called back. The lady said it hadn't gone out yet but we were next in queue and she could add our salads. She confirmed our address and name and gave us a revised total. Over an hour goes by and still nothing. We call back and a different woman answers the phone. She begins to argue with us claiming they are too busy to make promises about delivery time. We explain it's been 2 hours and the delivery guy finally arrives as we're on the phone. The pizza is cold and there are no salads. In addition, the cost is more than the total we were given on the phone including salads. She finally puts the manager on the phone, and his only solution was to take $15 off the bill. So we paid more than $40 for cold, cardboard pizza with skimpy toppings. This was absolutely the worst experience any of us have had for pizza delivery!"}

I tried to call 5 minutes later and the phone was off the hook. After an hour and a half, I called a girl answered. I explained my situation. She proceeded to tell me that the delivery driver went home and the other driver wouldn't be to work for 15 minutes and it would take another 15 minutes to get the food. I told her to cancel the order, but she told me I had already been charged. She did offer me a free dessert or soda. Do yourself a favor, go or order from anywhere else other than this establishment. Extremely poor customer service and unacceptable damage control. DO NOT EAT HERE OR FROM HERE!"}

My six year old didn't even like it. They were cold and soggy. The dough tasted like a cheap frozen pizza. One was pepperoni and the other was veggie, add spinach. Guess what no spinach, yet I was charged for it! One large order of onion rings- guess what!! The container probably had 8 pieces inside. Had I known It was going to be this bad, I would have gone to bed hungry. STAY AWAY!!!!"}

I ordered a 30\" half mexican taco and half pepperoni pizza and the chicken marsala pasta. The size of the 30\" pizza was pretty big and impressive. But to my disappointment I found a burnt bee on the lettuce. At first I thought it was an olive but then I saw there were legs and immediately stopped eating. I mean there are people that eat spiders, scorpions, crickets, lizards and a bunch if other stuff but for tonight i wanted to have a pizza with the family. Thank you flamingo for my extra special topping but I don't think I can come back."}
{"text":"This is usually a go to spot for us when we want good, fast, inexpensive eats. Our refrigerator is on the Fritz so we have had to kind of depend on take out for the past couple days. 
Last night we ordered around 1am I got a Club sandwich for the first time and it was delicious! Nicely toasted bread, nice amount of turkey and crispy bacon. Nice slices of cheese. So good. 
My husband got a meatball sub that he said was also REALLY good. The sauce was perfect, the meatballs were tender and fresh covered in gooey cheese on a crispy, soft roll. Both sandwiches came with a nice portion of fries. Bonus, our bill came out to under 20 bucks!!! 
So tonight it was a no brainer, we were ordering from Flamingo again. My hubby decided to get the Philly cheesesteak. He was again happy with his selection. Fresh, crispy on the outside, soft, chewy on the inside roll. Nicely seasoned tender beef, onions, peppers, and mushrooms covered in cheese goodness. Little short in the French fry department tonight. 
I was so impressed with the Club last night I figured I was going to have the same tonight. Boy was I dissapointed. First the \"toast\" was so pale I had to double check to see that it was in fact toasted. I mean some heat had been applied to the bread of only for a moment. Ok so the bread isn't toasted,ok....no biggie but then I noticed.....no cheese, no bacon and no onion ( I special requested the onion to be added) So basically after waiting an hour and a half ( oh did I not mention it took over 90 minutes to get my delivery) I ended up with a pitiful turkey, tomato and lettuce sandwich on three pieces of bread. So disappointed. I'm REALLY hoping this was juat a fluke."}

I logged on to yelp to check out some pictures and reviews and the pictures looked amazing of all of the pizzas. We decided to try one small pepperoni and one small Hawaiian. The crust has a really great garlic flavor to it! I usually prefer my crust thinner New York style, but the flavor made up for the thickness. I didn't have time to snap a pic as my boyfriend and I gobbled up right away. It's a good solid late night pizza place when you don't wanna leave the house."}

{"text":"Their pizza is good. Its better than most independent pizza places.

Thier attidue blows. They have terrible customer service and thier employees are not friendly.

They have (had) a 7.00 large pickup 1 toping special. Most of the time they let you do cheese on 1/2 and 2 toppings on the other half (still ends up being 1 topping)

But they change things around too often.

Today I called for the same pickup special and it was 7.99 + an extra topping 10.91 to pickup.

What? They just can't seem to be consistant. I'll eat pizza elsewhere.

Thanks."}

We just slammed the door in his face and ate the pizza, which was mediocre tasting. Never again. DON'T GET FLAMINGO PIZZA!!"}
{"text":"Ordered an hour and a half ago......... Food still isn't here......... I called and they just said the food was on it's way and that it's raining. Ummmmmmmm ok? Thanks I guess?
Finally, after another 15 minutes, the food arrived. (So we waited and hour and 45 minutes) On the plus side, the food was warm. But honestly, I've had frozen pizza that was better, and the chicken wings were nothing special. Plus, we were missing one of our toppings. And the driver had the nerve to ask for a tip. Sorry sweetie, but no. Learn how to do your job."}
{"text":"Love the Turkeye sandwich but the rolls are a little small.  
French fries just fair
Next time I'll try the pizza

{"text":"Horrible service waited over an hour for pizza. Very rude and uninviting. Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"This place is awful!!! They messed up our order and only brought 1 pie and wouldn't find a solution to come back with our 2nd pie!! Horrible customer service and horrible pizza full of basic tomato sauce. They wouldn't answer our calls and when they did they hung up!! NEVER order from this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Under new management and this pizza is horrible! My first time ordering from here since Grubhub offered it around 12am, worst mistake of my life!!! Never ordering from here I would have rather made the drive to anywhere else. The pizza was chewy like a cardboard box and dry. the pasta had dried pieces of chicken with pasta that was very bland. It was the worst experience I didn't think pizza could taste so bad and cold I couldn't believe pizza actually eat from here."}
{"text":"This place is shit with a rude delivery girl - Pizza Hut. Dominos and even Little Cesar's is better. 

Ordered 2 pizzas, wings and 6 pack of Dr. Pepper ($55.00 - Ouch!) Took 1-1/2 hours to deliver to the Courtyard by Marriott off Dean Martin ... Called twice to check on delivery both times I was told 'she should be there'. Somehow I get charged $60.00 after the ash tray smelling delivery girl leaves ... must have added a tip ??? I would challenge and dispute this theft BUT the poor lady needs to buy some lotion or perfume with it!! 

Again, this place is SHIT I will never order from here again and I would advise the same for you"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese pizza, 8 wings, and fries. Took an hour to get here which they were upfront about. Told me I would receive a call to pick up my pizza at the bell desk. After I received my call, I went right down. No pizza guy at the bell desk, he was playing slots. Once I found him, he was a nice enough fellow, but when I asked for change (delivery was included in $32 order) he laughed and pointed to the slots and said \"in there.\" Geez! Really?! I was tired 3:50 am, so returned to enjoy our pizza. Sadly, the pizza was cold & burnt on the bottom, yet the cheese/oregano flavor was good at least. The fries were good too, but lukewarm. The wings were the same. 

Would not order again due to the poor delivery, no change made, burnt pizza, and cold to lukewarm food. Two stars for flavor."}
{"text":"The food is so so, but the service is AWESOME! They made sure I had everything I needed and delivered it earlier they thought they would. They even stayed open late to make my food and called to make sure they knew exactly where to go. The pizza is so good and extra cheesey. Not a fan of their pork sausage but that's ok. Wings were meaty and good. Caesar salad wasn't very good. I wish I didn't order the salad"}
{"text":"No wonder why this place didn't have a name on the flyers. This place are thieves they would not refund my money back. They keep putting me on hold and hanging up on me since I was complaining about my food taking for over to arrived. I complained to the Trump Hotel front desk about this place and how they got pass the security and slides the flyers under the door. The manager apologies for them and gave me $50 hotel credit to order food from there kitchen. This place needs to learn customer service skills from the Trump Hotel guests services. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE THEY ARE THIEVES AND RUDE..."}
{"text":"Ordered food from them....it never showed up even after an hour they called to confirm items on order and told me 16 minutes , and waited and nothing showed up .....with all the great reviews they get I wish I could of tasted it"}
{"text":"Ordered food from here about an hour ago. I recently got a puppy so leaving my apartment for any reason has become quite a hassle. You can only eat pizzahut so many days in a row before you become depressed and start to question your life. Luckily flamingo pizza has a variety of choices on their menu so I thought I'd give it a go.

I am here, writing my first yelp review ever, to thank Flamingo Pizza for their service and quality of food. Not only was the price hella reasonable, it was honestly delicious, annnnd it got here in under 30 minutes.

~also our delivery driver was thee most colorful an delightful character. I really got the vibe he would put his life on the line to get me this double cheeseburger and FREE fries.

Order this shit."}
{"text":"It wasn't too bad when I ordered from them. I got a burger, Fries and one of those \"Test me\" platter thingies, and my bill was under 15 bucks. WITH tip. I got my food. turned on HBO and had a wonderful time watching Harry Potter and eating my wonderful meal!
 

I enjoyed it. 
Maybe I'm just not an uppity bitch.... I dunno."}
{"text":"I ordered through yelp last night for delivery of this pizza establishment because of their menu. I was craving a good white pizza which is hard to find. I looked no further than than Flamingo Pizza. I also ordered a side appetizer of breaded mushrooms. After ordering I was panicking since all of the reviews from here were so awful. I unfortunately did not base my ordering off the reviews.

The white pizza was fantastic and the even seemed like they used extra feta cheese. I was so impressed there was not even any leftovers for breakfast pizza. The breaded mushrooms were not the best, but I popped them in the microwave and they were just right. Problem alleviated. I did notice that prior patrons had issues with the times of their delivery and it being delayed. I did notice that it was 45 minutes late, but I fell asleep watching the tele so it was not an issue for me. I would order from this establishment again. And I would advise individuals ordering use the yelp app. It seems all other complaints dealt with human error. Save yourself some pain and use technology plus it leaves tracking for your order."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place a million times headed to Noodle House, but finally stopped in to pick up lunch. It was a Saturday so they sadly didn't have any lunch specials but opted for their fingers and fries, hot of course! The cashier was the owner and she was very pleasant. She even gave me a free canned soda with my purchase. Food was actually made to order and came out hot and fast. The bag had the ranch and napkins ready for me which was nice.

Food was good, but nothing special. I know the fingers were frozen because I saw the cook take them out of the walk in freezer, but really there's nothing wrong with that. 

They get a 4 because the service was nice, the food was made to order, and the free soda."}
{"text":"Delivery of the pizza took 1 hour 15 minutes to get delivered 2.3 miles.  Once it was delivered it was cold and my canned drink was warm.  Exactly the opposite I was looking for.....if you are hungry, order from someplace else.  I will not be ordering from them again, and nor should you!!"}
{"text":"The worse service ever when I placed my order I was told within the hour. When I called she said it wouldn't be more then ten more minutes it's been 45 more minutes and still no pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza is yummy & service is outstanding, & the prices are even better will be back soon."}
{"text":"The drive from Oklahoma to Las Vegas was well worth it. If you are in need of great pizza and even better customer service, Flamingo Pizza should be you first stop.."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star I would. Horrible customer service, and they do not honor their yelp coupons or their Groupons either. They charge a \"yelp tax\" and a \"groupon tax\" and they do not take phone orders for either one. They tell you to come in and the wait is 2 hours for Groupon orders, no matter what. The large Hispanic woman at the register claimed these biased rules were clearly on the register for all to see, however, they aren't. She offered to find them for me, though. Yeah, I cancelled both yelp and Groupon coupons and will advise everyone that this place is a rip off and is actively falsifying offers."}
{"text":"Waited over 90 minutes. Pizza was cold and they gave me very little toppings. I gave it away after the first piece. I LOVED this place when I lived here for 3 months in the Summer. I was looking forward to it and was really let down. Not worth the $30 I paid."}
{"text":"1 star for the delivery service. waited for over 2 hours for a delivery within a 2 mile radius like really????!!! i wouldn't even start on the food. i would give a 0 star rating if possible."}
{"text":"Blah blah blah, pizza was crap and man, pizza is like sex, even if it's bad, still should be ok. Not this one. \"Mild\" wings didn't have anything on them. At all. Chicken fettuccini looked like dog regurgitation and tastes worse. The only reason they got 2 was my wife's philly cheese was decent. But.. They didn't send me the extra order of fries I paid for.  threw out the menu, definitely won't be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"i ordered a half a bucket of chicken wings and the chicken finger and french fries meal. the food arrived with everything in the bag soaking wet. i picked up a french fry and it was completely soggy. the fry wouldnt even stand up straight. it just drooped over and almost broke in half. the chicken wings were soggy and a few were even bloody. the food was not even seasoned at all. the food was absolutely disgusting. i complained and atleast the lady that answered was very polite. she offered me a 20% discount on my next order, but i wont need it because ill probably never order food from them ever again."}
{"text":"Agh!! Where can I start? The biggest pizza I have ever seen! They haven't here. Really good! We got the chicken pesto pizza. I've never loved pesto so much after this pizza! The employees are awesome! They are always checking up on you to see if you need anything. I recommend this! 5 stars!t"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza from this restaurant and they said it would take an hour. I called after an hour and fifteen minutes and they said there was an issue with their oven and it would be another thirty minutes. After another thirty minutes they still didn't show up or call. I was VERY displeased with their customer service. They should have called and said that they were having issues with their oven and given us the option to just get our money back at that point. They also snuck into the hotel resort we were staying in and shoved their menus under the doors of the rooms knowing the hotel forbids that.  The driver also texted me after I asked for a refund and left a voice mail on my phone and was extremely rude."}
{"text":"What an absolute disappointment. We waited almost two and a half hours for a delivery we were told would arrive in an hour. After calling back 10 times to try to get an update and cancel, the food finally showed up and the driver forgot a third of our food then just made excuses for it. If I could give this place negative stars, I would. On top of that, they charged $3 for a child's sized Gatorade with our meal. I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in a meal. Definitely avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"I ordered Hawaiian pizza with jalapenos and combo app plater for delivery. I was staying at the palms so i was in lobby when driver came i told him my name he said hear you go. Was my fault for not checking my order. I go upstairs wasn't anything i ordered called bacl told them the they remade my food and sent out by then i was too tired i fell asleep. Pizza was not good, but im from Chicago so i know good pizza tasted more like little Caesars pizza."}
{"text":"Unprofessional workers. Conversations that were carried on in the front had a lot of offensive language used in them. This is not a true eat in restaurant. They had 5 or 6 two seat tables. The pizza was served in a to go box. No drink fountain, bottles and cans only. Pizza was decent, but we've had better. They also kept the front door propped open and a box fan running while it was barely 50 degrees outside. Lucky for them they deliver to the strip where they won't have a lot of returning customers."}
{"text":"I ordered the lasagna and chicken salad. The lasagna was pretty salty, luckily it comes with 2 slices of garlic bread. The chicken salad, I ate all of the chicken in the salad but overall, it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I had to drop this down from 5 stars to 3 stars because the first time was amazing. Pizza was crispy and so delicious and the wings were also crispy, juicy, and well seasoned but the service was a 3 star. Now having been there the 2nd time the service was 4 star but the pizza, wing, and calzone were a 3 star. The pizza was soggy, the calzone was burnt. The wings were just ok."}
{"text":"This place shouldn't be in business...2 hour delivery times and my order never arrived after repeated inquiries about the arrival time.  I should have read the other reviews...it seems as if they've had similar problems with others."}
{"text":"Fast and great service!
Great prices and good food!
Clean and foot deals! They open late night"}
{"text":"Someone slipped a menu from here under the door at the hotel I'm staying at so I thought it was ok food. Worst decision ever. After more than an hour of waiting for delivery my son got so hungry I had to feed him whatever instant baby food I had in the diaper bag... I will complain at the front desk to not let them spread menus here anymore."}
{"text":"Fatih,Christian, and Ruth are all the best. Best food after midnight after!!! I love pizza and now I think I can only come here for pizza it's so delicious."}
{"text":"Worst Expirrience of my life!!! I order a large taco pizza a large white pizza add pepperoni and 38 wings with 4 extra ranches. They charged me 6$ and some change because of the delivery fee thought ok cool understandable they charged for the extra pepperoni and ranch which I'm totally ok with my total came up to 86$. They tell me it's going to be an hour. Well it took them 1hr and 40 mins to get here I thought ok you know what it's okay things happen then my white pizza had NO pepperoni I thought ok well this sucks but whatever than they forgot to bring my order of wings! The driver had thee ordasity to say \"it's a far drive and no one wanted to come so I just grabbed whatever and left\" .  I am a server and I am very lenient when it comes to stuff like this but now I'm very upset ! I call the store and beside them being rude saying their bringing me wings they deny me from speaking to the manager. I told them I didn't want the food that could have everything back I just want a refund ! They said that no they can't do that blah blah blah the best they could do is 10% ! 10%are you kidding me you guys completely messed up my order gave me crappie ass service and only going to give 10% NO! I told them I'll pay for 1 pizza that got here right but that I should not pay for the pizza that is not completed or the wings that weren't even here yet. They said to call the next day and speak with the manager at 3:30 I've called and called and all they do is click on me nd tell me the manager isn't around! I well never in my life buy food from here again! I will definitely be telling everyone on FACEBOOK TWITTER INSTAGRAM SNAPCHAT even the news if I have to about how horrible this place is!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The owners make sure you are completely SATISFIED. The food is outstanding. THANK YOU FLAMINGO PIZZA."}
{"text":"pizza and wings were decent but there is a delivery charge and a credit card fee that tacked on an extra $10 to our total bill."}
{"text":"Great place to get your favorite foods especially late night because they close at 4am. You can get burgers, pizza, pasta, chicken, or even French fries. The customer service is awesome and would definitely recommend this place to anyone plus they deliver. I will be back here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered over the phone, right off the bat told them I had an allergy to cheese/milk/butter, went through a few items on the menu I ended up not being able to have. Ordered a pizza, just BBQ sauce, chicken & onions.  Paid to have it delivered to our hotel, when my boyfriend brought it up to our room, I noticed it was a regular cheese pizza with chicken and BBQ sauce on top. Called and let them know, the pizza was incorrect, I was told that was the standard for that pizza, a manager would call me about 3 hours later when their shift started to resolve the problem. About an hour after they were supposed to call, I gave them another ring. That's when Ruth answered the phone, I explained the situation and she told me that no manager was scheduled until the next day! She went out of her way to contact the manager on their time off, and got us a (correct) free 12\" BBQ chicken pizza. I am BEYOND SATISFIED with Flamingo Pizza and Ruth for going out of her way to fix the problem. Recommending this place to everyone, pizza was great so I will be coming back :)"}
{"text":"My body is seething with hate right now and I didn't even try their food. Flamingo Pizza has shady businness ethics. On Saturday, I decided to cancel my order after the lady said it would take between a hour and forty minutes. That was too late for me. A few days later my debit card has a pending charge even after I canceled. Ugh, I hate this. Don't fuck with my money. I know I might sound like an asshole right now because the transaction is still pending but I just don't like it when I'm being charged $50+ over something I didn't even buy. That could go towards a nice Christmas gift, ya know? Don't buy pizza in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza with anchovies and spinach. No spinach on the pizza, instead it was romaine lettuce.

I'm giving a 2 star rating because I like their wings. Unfortunately I won't be eating from here again."}
{"text":"If I could give negative stars I would. Waited nearly two hours for a pizza that I ordered. When it got here I asked the delivery guy why it took so long. He said in broken English that was barely understandable \" cuz we is the only place open\". I know this to be 100% false because I ordered delivery almost every weekend at the same time. To make things worse I opened the pizza box once inside after paying the confused man and had received the wrong pizza. I had ordered and paid for extra pepperoni and I received a cold, paper thin, cheese pizza. After contacting yelp services I am stuck in a battle between yelp 24, this shit pizza place, and customer service waiting hours for a \"manager\".  Whatever you do if you read this do NOT order from here. So many better options in the area. Also never and I mean NEVER trust a company that has yelp 24 as their delivery. YELP I would like my 35 dollars back. Will be blasting this on every social media sites until money is returned."}
{"text":"Literally the worst. Menu was slipped under our door at the Hilton GV & it's very appealing. WRONG. Order chicken Alfredo and was told it had to be a $15 minimum, so they offered me a dessert & I chose cheesecake. An hour & a half later, food gets delivered. I open the bag, and there's a salad, coke & pasta... no cheesecake. So I call back and ask, they told me they have me down for \" can of coke\", not cheesecake. How the hell I would know to order \"can of coke\" I have no idea but whatever. I just hang up and proceed to eat and the pasta doesn't even have sauce. Literally just noodles and chicken (see attached picture). Do NOT order here. Horrible customer service and food."}
{"text":"Pizza time! Always come here after a long night for the pepperoni special. If you're around the golden tiki and hungry, it's just a walk away and great pizza!"}
{"text":"\"No zucchini sticks.\" (This restaurant was NOT a good decision.) Took our order, processed our bill, and we waited. More than an hour later, the driver arrived. We were quite hungry. Once we opened our three bags of food we realized we got three salads, no dressings at all. Also noticeable were the mounds of olives on everything after we specially ordered \"no olives.\" Butter-soaked bread everywhere, after we ordered \"no butter.\" Lastly, the 20 sticks of zucchini was not to be found! We called immediately and were told \"the manager would need to call us back\"... Now after 1pm... Never did we get a call back. So we began attempts to get the zucchini and at least dressing for the salads. As I write this it is 2:16 am and the promised food has never arrived. The food we already received was fine, although the homemade chicken noodle soup was too salty and strangely similar to Campbell's......."}
{"text":"We ordered one of their big 28 inch meat lover's pizzas. What we received was a really big pizza box filled with pizza that looked like road kill. Looked like it had been tossed from the delivery man's moving vehicle, scooped up and put back in the box. $42 on pizza and $10 tip for the delivery guy, who had some serious balls handing us this crap. They brought us a new pizza after we called complaining. Same delivery driver....made sure we checked the pizza before he left this time. The driver was very rude. He accused us of dropping the pizza and when that didn't work he blamed his co-workers. The new pizza was tasteless, dry and had hardly any toppings. It was awful! Frozen pizza is better. Won't be calling this place again."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery, it made it here in about 45 minutes, which isn't bad. My burger was good but the garlic knots were burnt, which basically ruined them. They looked so obviously burnt, I can't believe they felt okay sending them out that way. I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I got a special through groupon and I have to say I wouldn't even pay $5 for their pizza! The lady that takes your order is rude and you can get a much better pizza at \"Little Caesars\" by far! This was my first time trying them since it was a special and I will never, ever go back there. You would think to earn more business they would try to make a customer happy?! And they regularly charge $18 for the pizza I ordered? No way! Like I mentioned it wasn't even worth $5. Save yourself the headache and go elsewhere because any other pizza joint would be much better than here. Not to mention the place looked dirty too but I forgot to check their Health demerits."}
{"text":"I ordered their Mushroom Swiss Burger with fries. Took about 15 minutes for my order to be ready.

I was very pleased with the result of my meal. It came in a foam container. The angus beef was surprisingly thick and juicy. The buns were delightful. Loved the mushrooms inside the burger and all the vegetables that were present.

Fries were exceptionally crunchy and came in a good amount of portion.

I was overall satisfied with my meal and would go back to try out more."}
{"text":"The service is so great !!!! And you can't beat the prices and the taste.  Mmmm. This place is a hidden gem that we found while on vacation.  We are pizza conozurrers so we expect quality and boy did we get it. I highly recommend Flamingos pizza."}
{"text":"Oh best pizza joint in Vegas. Been coming for years and never had any problems. Delivery is awesome, service in house is amazing. And the food is even better."}
{"text":"The food here looked amazing and tastes as good as it looks. The service was excellent and my whole family was very satisfied with our food. I would definitely come back, and would also recommend my family and friends."}
{"text":"WOULD GIVE 0 STARS IF I COULD!!! seriously STAY AWAY from this place. 40$ for cold pizza and wrong choice of drink. First the \"delivery\" took two hours (lady over the phone said it would be an hour, maybe less), and by \"delivery\" i mean lobby of the hotel. They asked me for my room number when i placed the order but then called me to go downstairs TWO HOURS LATER. IT WAS 3 AM AND OBVIOUSLY I WAS NOT HAPPY. Then when i was asked to go to the lobby, the girl forgets the card receipt so i can sign (i paid card over the phone). She calls the place back and I WAIT HALF AN HOUR while she's on hold/arguing with the employee on the phone (manager i presume). She then informs me SHE HAS TO GO BACK TO THE RESTAURANT, GET THE SLIP, COME BACK SO I COULD SIGN IT. At this point i was furious and told her i didn't want it anymore, so to cancel it. She tells me i have to call the place and cancel, also the money wouldn't be back on the card immediately, but the food was already there and i was starving so i decided to keep it. At the end i didn't know what the lady did but I did not go back downstairs to sign the slip. OH AND SHE STILL HAD THE AUDACITY OF ASKING IF I WANTED TO LEAVE A TIP. Also, this place doesn't even use their real name! The flyer in our hotel room just said \"Pizza and Grub\" so there is no way of checking reviews before hand!!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza showed up on time. They put a *lot* of cheese on it and it arrived really fresh and hot, so it was a little bit goopy and floppy when it arrived, but tasted great."}
{"text":"I have one comment to say about this place and its \"HORRIBLE SERVCIE\"!
I bought a Groupon online for this restaurant, and when I called to make an order the restaurant said that in order for me to use the groupon I would have to come in with the 4 people I was ordering for (even though that is not what the groupon requirements were). When we got to the restaurant my first opinion was how it didn't look too appealing, but hey some hole-in-the-walls are secretly the best, right? Well not this one!! Anyway, we waited almost 10 minutes while the workers occasionally stared at us but did not say anything. There were 2 people in the back making food, and 2 who were answering phones. Finally one of the workers, a lady with two tear drops tattooed on her face, asked me what I wanted to order. After I ordered my pizza and I began to get the payment together the lady answered the ringing phone again and walked away leaving me standing for at least 20 minutes before I decided that the food wasn't worth the disrespect and the time wasted. To say the least, we didn't even get the chance to try the food, but we can agree that this was the worst customer service experience that we have received from any company. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"}
{"text":"Best quality food for good deal and order served really fast!! I will definitely recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"FLAMINGO PIZZA AKA PIZZA & GRUB:

Horrific experience. Disgusting food, see pics of the cold, RAW and BLOODY chicken wings that were delivered to us at our hotel room- 2 hours after ordering, along with pizza that had no topping and was NOTHING MORE THAN UNBAKED DOUGH and red sauce. How does this even happen? - Also, you have to go and meet the sketchy delivery driver outside the hotel doors because they are not ALLOWED to solicit hotels to begin with. It's called TRESPASSING!!! 
BEWARE! It may seem convenient to order from your hotel room- but they are a scam.
Read the other reviews. Pretty consistent in regard to how awful they are."}
{"text":"The picture of the Pepperoni and Bacon pizza should be labeled as false advertising. The pizza we received had strips of bacon on it after waiting an hour.....wtf. We are giving one star because they brought it. Y'all need to close down! If this is what you all are sending out on a regular? I'm surprised you are still open! Pizza is crap!"}

{"text":"I was staying at a hotel and decided to give this place a try. I ordered some pizza and appetizers for delivery. I waited for 2 hours. I understand that some places get slammed with orders but giving my order to another customer is another thing. I gave them another chance after they offered me discount and a shorter ETA (25 min). 45 mins later, the food shows up but they forgot my soda; pizza and appetizers were cold. At this point, I'm not angry, just in disbelief. I've never had such bad service in my life. It's almost comical. I'm not a yelper but I signed up so I can write a review on this place. If you should choose to eat from here, do not, I repeat, do not pick the delivery option."}
{"text":"Do not call them if you want a pizza delivered. This review is purely service, or the lack there of. Ordered A pizza and it was told it would be to me in one hour and 20 minutes. I called for a status check at the one hour and 30 minute mark, my items have not even made it to the oven.  

I understand if you're behind, but you better call your customers with a follow up.  

I can't say that I will ever give this place another chance. I was hungry, now I'm just pissed."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!  I'm from out of state and bought a Groupon for this place.  Waste of money.  Placed order at 11:39 pm incomplete oder brought to me at 12:45 am. They didn't give me my brownie I ordered and paid an extra $5.50 to have it.  They brought one item  out at a time.  By the time my incomplete oder Came out my pizza was cold.  If this is how you treat your out of state customers I can only imagine how you treat the locals. Terrible service.  Never again.  Didn't offer to comp die their mistakes."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch from here today...completely disgusting. Yea, you would have to be drunk to order from Flamingo Pizza. I ordered, did not eat the meat ravioli, my son ordered their pizza (sausage & pepperoni)! 6 ravioli with one spoonful of sauce. They were so dried out, tried one ravioli only to throw the rest away ALONG with their menu!!!"}
{"text":"I tried their pizza. I loved it. Very fresh and tasty. I am glad I found my pizza place. Most places have soft bread that falls apart. Not this place. Added benefit is that  they are open late."}
{"text":"This place is literally garbage! People be aware and and stay away! I ordered 2 pizza's around 8pm. After talking to horrible order taker on the phone I asked her how long till it's delivered. She replied no more than an hour, I said ok no problem. Only reason why I even ordered is because we were in s hotel room just came back from swimming family was tired and hungry. I then noticed 2 hrs have gone by and still no pizza' I called this place back aka Pizza Grub according to their flyer pushed under my hotel room door. They stated to me that my pizza was already delivered' I then got upset and explained that my pizza was never delivered and it's been passed 2 hrs. I then asked to speak with a manager who first and foremost didn't even apologize but rather yell at me. He said he would give me 15% off my total' are you kidding me?? I told him no thank you! And demanded a full refund. Then the owner gets on the phone, some Indian dude and curses me out saying F$&@ M@&&$) F\"@&&$ NO Refunds!!! Please stay away this place will rob you and won't deliver your food. Or if they do deliver it it's going to be nasty. I wish I would have read the reviews first!!! Moral of the story I was robbed $45 and was not refunded, had to call my credit card company to hold my card..."}

The cashier was very polite and nice. The pizza was delicious but was so cheap on their meat basically  we were eating a cheese BBQ pizza with like only 30%meat lol yes what a joke.  Maybe cos I bought it with Groupon deal. So Groupon deal is a joke here."}
{"text":"Purchased a deal via Groupon, called in my order and before getting off the phone they asked how I was paying, I said Groupon. They said I would need 4 peeps w/ me to redeem it. This was fine as I had my husband and kids with me, however, it does not state that on the Groupon (as shown). I arrived maybe 5-10 mins after calling and simply said the fine print doesn't state anything about 4 people and they said it was OK, but at the same time, another employee was telling a Groupon customer on the phone this was a requirement and they also had to order in person. I waited 20 mins and upon getting my food they were friendly and good enough to ask if I needed ranch, plates, etc.. Food was on point. Got a Flamingo deluxe and cheese pizzas, some wings and fries. I would recommend this place to others, but warn about friendliness.


The initial interaction wasn't the greatest but they were good at the end."}
{"text":"Order delivery from them if you want (1) highschool boy deliver (2) a cold pizza (3) 2hrs after your order. Don't get fooled by \"45-60min delivery time\" since they delivery it to you almost 2hrs later. 
I ordered 12\" meat lover pizza through Yelp at around 1:00-1:10ish am on late Saturday night (or earlg Sunday to be precise). 
There was absolutely no sign of delivery until 2:20 so I called the restaurant but the lady said driver will call me in 5-10min. I waited until 2:50 but no one called or came so I called again but the lady said \"So what is your question\" when I told her my name and address. She said she'll call the driver and after few minutes, someone knocked on my door. When my husband opened the door, a highschool boy just handed us a box and left. Didn't ask what I/we ordered or no confirmation at all. Just left. 
Try to avoid this place as much as you can. To me, it felt like they don't want to run their business since owner or whoever answers the phone is rude, makes highschool kid who doesn't even care deliver your order and delivers cold, hard pizza to you."}
{"text":"DO NOT order online whatever you do! It is 4:26 right now, I ordered the pizza at 2:25.  They blame the hour delay on the 24/7 app that you can order pizza through. I called at 3:45 to ask about the pizza and the lady I spoke to explained the situation and said they didn't get the order until 3:20, which she believed to justify the hour delivery time.  At 4:08 I got a call from the delivery driver saying he was at the palms, which I am at the luxor...he kept tryinging to tell me I gave the adress for the palms. I TRIPLE CHECKED! Nope. I gave the right address. Called the restaurant back. Same nonsense about my order not coming in until an hour after the intial order. Maybe they should use a different program for online ordering. 4:36 Delivery guy just called me to explain that he had no idea where the room was ...I tried as clear as I could to explain it and he hung up on me. I am beyond upset at this point....I have no idea if he is coming or if I am screwed out of $30! It is now 2 hours and 30 minutes and I get called to the front desk to pick up my pizza...get the pizza back to the room....pizza is cold and order is wrong...we were also told we would get a complimentary 2 liter for the inconvenience....we did not."}
{"text":"Very average pizza. Nothing special. We bought the groupon so we had to use it, but not a convenient location or anything. Didn't appear to be a good area. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to visit!!
Good prize for Hungry people.
Working next door and just found this cool place!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst experience. Took them 2 hours to deliver my pizza which was cold & not edible. I would never recommend this place. Their pizza is garbage. We called to complain and they would not give us the address, they also said the manager was not around. Do not order pizza from here"}
{"text":"Ordered from Eat24 last night. Of course being Christmas, there was not a big choice. I read all the reviews and thought this would be good. WRONG! I am shocked at the four and five stars. The pizza was 2 hours late, that didn't bother me as much because of the holiday but it was ice cold and soggy crust. We ordered a 16 inch pepperoni and mushroom pizza and there was not much of it! Also ordered a Caesar salad.  The lettuce was wilted and very small portion for the price. The spaghetti was overcooked and marina tasted like it was from a can that need water added.  This was not cheap. I could understand you get what you pay for but for over 40 dollars, I truly would have been more satisfied with little Caesars-which. Is not high on my list! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"We got a $20 value Groupon and spent it on a 16 inch pizza (half pesto half Hawaiian) a soda, one cheesecake and got free fries (probably the best fries I've ever had). Totally worth it."}
{"text":"Seriously  the best pizza and chicken wings I've had!! It's slightly hidden so you have to know its near zizzy's and some other bars. Great staff too! Fatih and the other staff are super awesome and accommodating. They are open for 20 hours so if you want late night pizza then come here!!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here for late night delivery and never got a conformation email, our food took an hour and 30 min to get  here our pizza was cold!!  Not even a little warm my salad had fake cheese and meat rolled up and the lettuce was brown. DONT ORDER!!!! It was awful  and the delivery guy made us go meet him outside he said we didn't give a room #,  which we did then I asked if he could bring it if I gave it to him and he told me no the hotel won't allow it.  I asked and they said other places deliver all the time... Wow such a bad experience with this place."}
{"text":"While staying in Las Vegas my husband and I ordered delivery of wings, pizza and Chicken Marsala from Flamingo Pizza & Restaurant. One and a half hours after eating the wings my husband got sick. His stomach gave him problems most of the following day. My chicken marsala looked like something they picked up at a fast food restaurant. What little chicken there was, was breaded and looked like they had taken chicken nuggets or 1 chicken tender and cut it up. I counted maybe six very very small pieces of chicken in the dish. The flavor was awful! The white pizza did not have any ricotta on it as advertised in their flyer. The delivery was supposed to take 1 hour to 1 hour and 20 minutes. It took 2 hours! All of the food was luke warm when it arrived. Either the driver had too many deliveries or he went somewhere before coming to our hotel. I called the restaurant to complain and asked to speak to the manager and was told that the manager only works days. I tried calling them three times yesterday and was told each time that he was unavailable. I tried again today and was told he only works evenings. He is obviously trying to avoid speaking to me. My suggestion to anyone who is thinking about ordering from Flamingo Pizza is to think twice. The food is extremely bad!"}
{"text":"I'm throwing in an extra star for the great service. That's about it. I ordered some chicken fingers and fries here. The fries are ok... crispy style. The chicken fingers? In a nutshell: I'm not sure that's chicken. They're like deep fried patties of congealed animal fat. Something like imitation chicken but far squishier. Who knows? This might be what's passing for chicken fingers nowadays in Vegas. If that's the case, I take it all back and replace my review with an overall sense of pity for a whole town doomed to be served with the worst examples of chicken fingers possible. Sorry, Vegas."}
{"text":"We just orders pizza to Sand Dollar! $20 for 18' and it came raw!! Horrible!!! Never again!"}
{"text":"So i ordered food from here tonight worst experience ever i ordered an 18 piece buffalo wings and i got 13 plain wings i also ordered a pizza that was missing toppings and was cold like they had it just sitting there the garlic bread wasnt even toasted like they just took a piece of french bread and slapped some garlic butter on it fries were cold and the zucchini sticks were all mushy will never order food from here again"}
{"text":"It's 5AM and 3 girls are back at their Vegas hotel room-- drunk and wanting nothing but pizza! Unfortunately, even in Sin City-- Dominoes, Pizza Hut and all the other big chain pizza places close at 4am! Thank GOD for Flamingo's (the close at 5). The pizza arrived hot and fresh in about 40 minutes! YUM! Three girls killed a 10-slice pizza in less than 30mins-- only in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I used to love the philly cheese steaks from this place, i can not help but be really disappointed this time. When i opened my box just big gobs of COLD unmelted cheese, (thought i ordered a HOT sandwich) The meat was dry, the bread was so hard & stale. Definitely a terrible experience considering i knew what they WERE capable of."}
{"text":"This place doesnt deserve more than 2 stars.
Where do I start? 
Firstly, when I  called they asked me to hold for 10 minutes which I was fine with since it is the weekend. We order and they tell us it will be delivered in less than an hour.

Then, an hour and 10 minutes pass so we decide to call and see whats going on. Someone answers and right away tells us to hold. This time 15 minutes pass so we hang up. We decide to call once more, this time they answer and ask what we want (the lady had a very bad attitude). We tell them we've been waiting for an hour and a half for our food. She says it will be deliver in 10 minutes. Now we're getting a little frustrated. We could've gone to the mcdonalds down the street and ate by now.

Lastly, we wait 20 minutes and the delivery guy finally calls and tells us to meet him at the regristration desk in the front of the hotel.
You're kidding right? They asked for our room number and we gave it to them. Why couldnt they deliver to the room? What is the point of delivery if I still have to get off my comfy bed and walk half a mile to get my food? We paid $5 for delivery. The food was fair at best, rather cold and stale. 

Pathetic."}
{"text":"Excellent service & very friendly. Great deals on the pizza & really good! Really close to the strip & they deliver as well. I'll definitely be coming back and hopefully trying more things on the menu because they have a lot of options"}
{"text":"Very convenient pizza place especially late at night staying on the strip! Friendly service and quick!"}
{"text":"Mediocre....lets just say.. Not a hygienic pizza joint...no more comments...last time I come here sorry..."}
{"text":"The reason I'm only giving a 3 star review is their service. I understand it's a late Friday night and it's constant call orders for them. Would highly appreciate it if they weren't rude over the phone. We ordered the large pizza and it came out to be about $18+. We were recommended by a friend about this place saying they had very cheap pizza. We gave them a call saying we want a large pepperoni pizza for takeout. The lady didn't tell us our total, and sounded like she was being rushed then hung up. Well of course it's our mistake as well not asking what's our total but a common courtesy for them to tell us a total over the phone without asking would be nice. Came in got our pizza, was shock on the total but we didn't want to make a fuss about it then left.

The pizza we ordered was good, had the thin crust style. Was served ready and hot when we picked it up. No complains about the pizza just the service could use some good phone etiquette."}
{"text":"The gyro and the pizza go together real good.   Real good!  The gyro meat is lean yet hearty and the pizza is made with dough and cheese and sauce (nice!).  The sandwiches are good and the mingling of flavors bursts in your mouth like cluster bombs falling on groups of orcs in some vast battle.  I am often reminded of orcish warfare when eating hoagies a.k.a. Grinders a.k.a. Subs and the pasta is good too.

If you could watch a yeti trained in the art of snakefist Kung Fu battling about four or five tonfa wielding centaurs then you sort of get the idea of what to expect when eating their appetizers and stuff. I like Flamingo Pizza.  I like alot of things."}
{"text":"This was absolutely disappointing!  We ordered through amazon app, Amazon, you need to take them off your restaurant list, everything was burnt, the pizza still smelled like dough and the topping came right off when tried to pick up a piece. We are starving and forced to eat it so, i mean who doesn't love the taste of burnt bread! You are lucky there is a 1 star minimum.."}
{"text":"I don't know why people are bitching about Flamingo Pizza when in their reviews they say they ordered anything but pizza, but I am SO happy that I found their menu on my hotel room floor because they deliver well into the wee hours of the night. Pizza delivered to my hotel lobby at 3AM is a necessity. I can get two 18\" one topping pizzas (always mushrooms and pepperoni) in under an hour and for roughly $30 (including tip). They deliver to the entire Strip but can only go as far as the hotel lobby, but do you really want a stranger knocking on your hotel room door at 3AM? Their pizza is super tasty by the way. I must've killed half of one pizza laying in my bed watching The Walking Dead reruns after a longass night of clubbing. Never tried anything but their pizza, but if you're going to call a pizza store and order a burger or a Philly cheesesteak and then complain about it, you really need to take a good close look at yourself in the mirror. Oh, and that other half, if your hotel has a microwave, you've got breakfast! Thanks for taking care of my 3AM pizza cravings Flamingo Pizza, I'll definitely be calling you the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered the lasagna and a coke, was told my order was $13 but the minimum was $15, the man on the phone said he would waive this rule for me and when the delivery driver arrived at my hotel I was told that 1. He could not deliver up to the room and I would have to meet him outside the hotel and 2. My order total was $20
The lasagna was mediocre and mostly sauce, would not eat here again."}
{"text":"A very mom and pop type of restaurant. Yay for small businesses!! Lived the vibe and the customer service is so kind. Such a wide variety to their menu!"}
{"text":"I'm in town by myself this week for a conference and even though my company is hosting a free dinner tonight, and party, I decided to stay in my hotel room and order out because my feet hurt and I have blisters. I ordered a margarita pizza, raviolis with a salad and garlic bread and a two liter of soda. The Margarita Pizza had sauce on it. Margarita pizzas aren't supposed to have sauce. The raviolis were drowned in sauce and there were only 5 raviolis in the dish. I included a picture. The Margarita Pizza wasn't cooked and the salad dressing they delivered was the wrong salad dressing. The menu stated Diet Coke so I ordered a Diet Coke and they sent a Diet Pepsi. When the driver arrived he called me and said I needed to come down and pick it up. I explained to him that I was in my pajamas and I couldn't walk cuz I had blisters on my feet. If I could walk I would have eaten at one of the other 1 million restaurants that were in the lobby of my hotel. Money wasn't an issue I just had a hard time walking and wanted to stay off my feet. It feels like a mile from my hotel room to the lobby. He argued with me extensively and I cut him off and said, \"Why was I even asked what my hotel room number was if I was going to have to go to the lobby and pick up my food? They should have explained that on the phone.\" He said he couldn't leave his car. Last night, when I came back from my conference, I saw a driver putting menus under the doors of all the hotel rooms on my floor. If in fact it's true that the drivers aren't allowed to leave their cars and deliver food to the hotel rooms then why did I see a guy delivering food and putting menus underneath the doors? Hands down, of all the places I've ever eaten at, this is the worst restaurant I have ever witnessed in my life!!! I just hope there were no bugs in any of the food that I did eat."}
{"text":"This Pizza was the absolute worst pizza I've ever eaten in my life. 
We honestly couldn't Bear to eat that much because it was so nasty. 
Save your self don't eat here."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good and they have good portions. The calzone was good for two people and reasonably priced considering the portion size. The service was fast which is good if you're ordering at 3 in the morning. Definitely recommend and it's close to the strip!"}
{"text":"Wish i could give this place negative stars!  We placed an order online and called 20 mins later to made sure it went through.  The lady on the phone confirmed our order.  We waited and called again an hour later.  The lady said that the delivery person just left and was on their way.  After waiting a total of 2 hours we called back.  The lady said we had NEVER placed the order.  This review is solely based on the lack of customer service.  Because we never got to try the food."}
{"text":"Love this pizza shop!!! Great location, amazing hours (open till super late), tons of choices on the menu. 

The pizza shop has a new owner as of a month ago and a new menu too! So it's under new management and improved! 

Street parking infront. Great customer service. Indoor and outdoor seating. Very clean. 

I tried their pesto chicken pizza, white pizza with basil, bacon cheeseburger and fries and chicken Caesar salad. They have sooo much variety on the menu. 

They deliver and open till 4am during the weekdays and 530am during the weekend. Which is great for late night eats and an alternative to other asian options in Chinatown . Very close to the strip if you're looking for cheap and yummy eats after partying and they can even deliver to you! 

I'm a fan! Will be back for more!

Flamingo pizza has a pizza my heart! Aloha 9th island."}
{"text":"I have never left a review before, but I feel I need to share how horrible my first experience was. First of all the delivery was late, which I can see from other reviews that this is a common occurrence. Second, I had gotten a deal that includes a 2 topping pizza, 18 wings, & a 2 liter soda. What I received was a pizza, & a can of soda. When I asked for a refund all I got was 20% off my order. That was $5.60, that doesn't even cover the price of 18 wings. Plus they completely denied giving me a can of soda even when I sent in a picture. Horrible first experience, I won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Delivery took almost an hour and a half and pizza was fairly greasy. Ordering online was easy and pizza was average."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings were good! It took them an hour and half to get here and the pizza was cold!!! We also had to call back and ask about a special! 

We ordered white pizza, 8 wings and a 2 liter and it was $40. After looking at the menu, we realized for $2 more we could get 20 wings. This wasn't pointed out by the staff at flamingo's we had to call back! Also, they charged me for a white pizza with chicken and mushrooms and they didn't include mushrooms! 

They did send free birthday cheesecake... Which I appreciate! Just got hangry waiting for my food because instead of 45 minutes it took 90 minutes to get our food! They are really friendly just not speedy!"}
{"text":"I really like this pizza joint. At first it seems like any restaurant where you could get just a slice of pizza from but one look at the menu and you will see that this place has everything from calzones to tiramisu. I was thoroughly impressed. The food is top notch and I don't plan on going anywhere else for pizza ever again. Being a Las Vegas native, I love supporting local businesses. I even met the owner the last time I went there with a coworker and he was a genuine guy who cared about his craft and the people who came to his business."}
{"text":"Made an order online. 

They take the money from my account and send a confirmation email right away. Including an estimated delivery time. 

20 minutes later they send an email saying that they can't deliver because they're lacking a delivery person. 

I'm 2 blocks away and I'm paying $5 for delivery and a 20% tip. they should send their employee on a brisk walk. I don't know how this place is in business. 

I am so unsatisfied they should be smart enough not to accept the order if they are unwilling to deliver.

So disappointing. Now everything is closed. And I'm starved. Bummer for real."}
{"text":"The person who answered the phone has no idea how to take care of customer, food was not good. I ordered Philly Cheesesteak, grilled cheese sandwich, fries and a coke. They offered me pepsi since they did not had coke, fries were ice cold, cheesesteak had no test in it and I didn't even tried the sandwich.........
i would never go their again."}
{"text":"Great service. Pizza is huge and with plenty of toppings for a reasonable prize! I will be back on my next visit."}
{"text":"The best comfort food for super late hours. Taste like neopoletana pizza. Their pizza is humongous and tasty. The location is hard to find but a lot of locals eat here."}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Great prices! Got 2 16\" pepperoni and they provide a good customer service! We be back!"}
{"text":"Few night ago was in vegas. Ordered couple pizzas, wings and plain salad. Paid 88 total. The pizza wasn't good at all. It was greasy, soggy, and just gross. I ordered the second to the largest pizza I think 24\". I also ordered a cheese pizza- don't remember the size, maybe 18\". Salad was good. Wings were meh. Delivery took about 2 hours but I was made aware of that when I ordered. Would NEVER order from here again...not worth the money or wait."}
{"text":"Driver took a hour in half when it should of been 30-45 minutes order was wrong and pasta noodles overcooked and no ranch for salad . Food was nasty"}
{"text":"I would give a higher rating than most of the other postings I notice here. The service on a take out order was very polite and the food quality and quantity was quite good. The ambiance is not impressive if you were wanting to dine there, but okay for a quick repast while on the move. They are in an awkward location with limited parking options. Hope they make it."}
{"text":"I was planning to go home and fix some lunch on my day off, but the doctor's appointment took about an hour longer than usual (98% wasting away in the many exam rooms where the nurse takes you blood pressure). Since I skipped dinner and breakfast, I opted to find a new place to try without going over $20.

So I searched which Groupon I still have to use before they expired and also browsed what good deals they might have. Ultimately decided on getting a new Group promo on Flamingo Pizza, since it is only a slight detour and a new place To try (even in spite of the low ratings).

The place was emptied when I first arrived, but after the lady greeted me the phone calls started coming in for delivery orders, which was fine since I was still looking over their menu.  I decided to order the 18\" Flamingo Deluxe pizza since it will use up the full value of the Groupon plus another $4.  

The pizza is the thinner crusted variety. The dough is made fresh, not the best I have ever had, but also not oily like Pizza Hut's pizzas. The toppings used are also fresh, just seemed a bit light compared to other photos uploaded on their Yelp page.  

If you plan to have pizzas made at Flamingo Pizza, I recommend having it on premise. Nothing beats freshly baked pizzas just a minute or two after coming out of the oven.  It is still good after you personally take it home, leaving the takeout box not completely closed, since I can see it gets soggy if the trip home takes more than 20-30 minutes (one of the main complaints of delivery orders that takes over an hour).

So if you work or live in the vicinity of Las Vegas's Chinatown Plaza and bored of the many good Chinese, some Japanese and Korean and even Thai restaurants menu offerings, maybe pizza or calzones within walking distance will the perfect cure.  

They open really late, 4am most nights and 5am on weekends. Viable option for those late night pizza cravings when your freezer is out of stock of Red Barron's frozen pizza pie."}
{"text":"This was a terrible experience.  Ordered delivery to hotel room where they had placed flyer under my door. They over charged 10.00 above price on flyer. Didn't show up until an hour and a half later. Driver called and made me meet him at front of hotel.( they were able to bring the flyer to my room but not my order) the food was cold and soggy. Do yourself a favor. Don't order from this place. They even go by a fake name \" pizza and grub \" on hotel flyer. I found out it was this restaurant by searching the phone number. I would give 0 stars if possible."}
{"text":"The pizza at this place was delicious! Our daughters loved it too. We were in a big rush and they accommodated us with super fast service and the people were so nice and thoughtful! Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service I got my pizza and hour and 15 minutes later it was very cold this is what the ranch look like when I ordered and paid for ranch nothing in it ridiculous then I called to ask them  make me a new pizza  didn't even ask for a refund just wanted a new pizza they can pick up this cold one and they tell me they'll give me a call back in 30 minutes because they can't make me a new one I thought I could even bring a whole pizza down wasn't even eaten and she said no even if you bring it down here we are not gonna make you a new one because the manager is not here what kind of services that I did call my friend that works at the news and I will be calling the health inspector this is  ridiculous...."}
{"text":"Took 2 and a half hours to get my food. Kept calling and different people told me it was just put in the oven after an hour"}
{"text":"Got the Groupon because it was a good deal. Ordered pizza and wings and went to pick it up. Got there and the cashier said the driver took my pizza and was around the corner. Waited 20 minutes til he got back. I was in a hurry to get back to work. Once I got to work I opened the pizza box and half the pizza was burnt also the mild wings had no sauce at all on them. After having spent over an hour just trying to get the pizza I called the business only to be hung up on, called back and was put on hold for 15 minutes then for the girl to say my manager isn't here and that I need to leave a message. Never ordering here AGAIN. They ruined the lunch for my work teammates and wasted a lot of valuable time."}
{"text":"If you like... 

-Getting your food literally the next day (ordered at 10:30, delivered at midnight)
-Dry, mediocre food for way more than it's worth
-A delivery guy with an poor attitude who will make you meet him downstairs to pick up your food

... then this place is for you! Bon crapetit."}
