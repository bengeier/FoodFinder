{"text":"I have NEVER thrown away a pizza. The amount of cheese and grease. And trust me I never complain about pizza. I eat frozen pizza and don't even complain about that. Damn!!!  They need a new crust and less cheese. And it would be perfect. However, they have other things on the menu I'm going to try. 

Don't listen to me, you might like it. But me and 2 others did not like it one bit."}
{"text":"Have eaten hear many times, always a good meal at a reasonable price. They recently changed ownership but continue to serve a great meal. Pizza is some of the best in Calgary, Steak, Lasagna, Chicken Parmesan, are all excellent."}
{"text":"We came here for dine in. They had 20 different kinds of pizzas. The largest size was 12 inches (wtf?). Pricing was on par for Calgary which means it is a rip off by common sense standards. Out came a great Greek pie; good ingredients, cheese, crust, sauce. Nothing life altering, but would be decent if I were in the neighborhood (which I normally am not). Check it out if in the hood."}
{"text":"Been a customer for 15+ years, still one of my favorite pizza joints. We always go for delivery when we visit dad's house. They have the best chicken wings ever here, pizza is great. Everything else we've ordered from here is great. I've never had bad food or bad customer service from here. I hope they stay open for a very long time to come."}
{"text":"This the best place in Vegas, hands down, if u want to eat some good food for a good price this is it. And i don't know what kind of cheese they use but it's amazing, my girl also says the chicken fingers are worth every penny. I always get a small pepperoni pizza and it's almost to much, a meal and a snack if u eat the crust, and you should, it's also delish"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for over 10+yrs. highly recommend great prices great food great great great !! Their ranch is fantastic they make it from scratch!"}
{"text":"OOOOMMMMGGGGG!!!!
this place is amaaaaazing!!!
Pizza, wings, fries, chicken fingers! 
And the ranch... don't get me started!!!
I LOVE real, homemade ranch and that's just what it is!!!"}
{"text":"Can't speak to the quality of the food because I couldn't even order it with the nasty asshole who answered the phone. I asked if he had an online menu for me to look at and he answers \"nope.\" And hangs up. Ummmm ok dude...who needs business right?"}
{"text":"This place is the best there chicken wing an French fries plus more is worth eating there I have to say this is my favoriteplace to go."}
{"text":"I will totally drive across town just for a slice of pizza or lasagna from Odyssey Pizza. Their pizza is the thick kind, loaded to the max, covered in cheese. The sauce is fresh and tangy with just the right amount of spices. I usually order the Odyssey special which is a loaded pizza. I'm not a huge crust fan but theirs is so good, I will eat every last crumb. I'm sure they're using the good old fashioned full fat kind of cheese. It's all crispy on top but nice and melty gooey when you pull the pieces apart. Oh I can taste it now. In my opinion, this is the one of the best places for pizza in the city. Their lasagna is pretty darn good too. I would recommend either to anyone."}
{"text":"Looking at the reviews for pizza in Calgary, we had been anxiously awaiting a time where we could go in and order at Odyssey. Tonight was the night! But, it was Lasagna Tuesday! $4.50 for a meal! How could we resist!? We choked back the 1970's decor and had a seat in the lounge where the lasagna was cheapy-cheap. (You could not get it for the low price on the other side in the restaurant. I am sure it is because they want you to drink alcohol $$$$, paybacks!!) Of course we ordered drinks and there was not a soul in the restaurant portion so the lounge suited us just fine. The usual suspects I assume were up at the bar and I was told that this establishment has a clientele that has been coming back to them for 35 years. That said, the business has changed hands to new owners recently (Greek to Korean). We spoke to the new owner and she said that they did not want to change a thing - their menus, staff... this has to be why the lasagna was so bland - to cater to all taste buds, Amazing what a bottle of Tobasco can do! In fairness, this is completely understandable to have it so plain and average, I just like my lasagna to have a Zip and a Zing to it as well as things in it (veggies). The portion size was very good and the Texas toast was a nice accompaniment. Totally worth $4.50 and we did not have to wait too long to get served. There were only 3 people at the bar so the owner and waitress were very chatty and friendly, spoke to us almost the whole time we were there! We are still anxious to have pizza from here and we will order for carry out as you get 20% off this way. I do have to note that we loved the cheese on the lasagna and it was good and hot temperature-wise. 
We will not likely dine inside of here again but if the pizza is really good we will not have an issue giving Odyssey our business and driving over here for pick-up. Of note, their delivery area is very limited.
I would have been 4 years old when this place opened - you can tell, but I will not hold that against them! It is what it is!"}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite place to get good wings.

When we go I usually order their wing combo with 12 wings, fries, and drink. I love this place cuz their wings are ALWAYS cooked the perfectly.

Their pizza is also good but their wings is the reason I keep coming back.

Odyssey is the definition of a whole in the wall with great food lol"}
{"text":"Wow, i ordered hot wings and got only one stick of celery haha. Pizza is freezer aisle lvl. Hot wings are soso. Nothing wow. But when yer at a lock down grimeie hotel like el cortez and drunk. These guys are the go too. Cheap fast and patience with drunks."}
{"text":"Wings of an angel. That's the only explanation for these great wings. A taste of heaven on earth. I've been looking for a place with great wings and now I have found it. If you want great tasting wings come to this place. You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good a little greasy but nothing a paper towel can't handle..my babe said the chicken wings are good..a hole in the wall pizzeria on Fremont not bad!!!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident, while getting lost once again ! The area left a lot to be desired , but the food was amazing. The slices were big, and the crust was just right. I also ordered a side of wings  that came with Blue Cheese and Caesar sauce with celery. The wings were wet which I prefer not over fried or crunchy. The quantity and quality for the price was great.

Staff were very personable, and helpful.
I left with easy directions to my destination and the best pizza and wings I've had in a long time.

It's not near my home, but I will definitely be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"This place is the best I been coming here for like 12yrs really good the wings are the best frays are good the only thing that sucks no ac in the sumner is no joke in here.."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for over a year now and I love their chicken fingers and fries. The location isn't great, but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"This little family joint does not disappoint in the pizza category.

These guys over at Odyssey are doing pizza right. I ordered some local special pizza (I forget the name) but it was so loaded with toppings that even after a few slices I was very full. The pizza was loaded with good meat and vegetables making for a great meal. The service was good as well.

Check out this place for a family style restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Best wings, pizza, ranch and fries spot!!! I've been coming here for quite a while, I would have to say about 10 years. I have tried other spots but no other place comes close to Odyssey. The owner and the cook have been working together since the first time I've been there!! I live 15-20 minutes away and the drive is totally worth it. Yeah the appearance is not the best but who cares the food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I guess i liked the pizza more then my brother but yeah, this is the place your gonna want to order if you want pizza to come to you. We dont eat just a slice thus not eating on on Fremont. I thought it was funny that i only got one celery stick."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I don't like their pizza or their chicken wings.  But I am crazy about everything else they serve, including their burger lunch special, their chicken fingers, and of course, their lasagna with garlic toast.  Perfect for lunch, perfect for a take out dinner when Mom is too tired to cook,  Nice salads for the ladies on a diet.  Not an upscale place, but none of those upscale prices either."}
{"text":"I stopped in here from a recommendation from the staff at Best Muffler Shop while I was getting some work done on my car. 

Don't let the outside fool you, from the outside, it almost looks like the building might be abandoned because there's not a lot of signage from the front, you enter from a small black door on the side. 

Once inside, the menu is pretty well laid out, not too big, not too small, they have enough options to satisfy most without the menu options being overwhelming.

I ordered a Philly cheesesteak with fried mushrooms, and it was one of the best ones I've ever had.

I met the owner Louie who was from Greece, so he certainly knows how to make good food.

Coming from myself as a local, the quality and taste of the restaurant was just awesome, looking forward to returning. 

Note, I was NOT offered anything in exchange for this review, this is my honest opinion and experience."}
{"text":"Today I tried their 7oz. New York steak lunch special, served with saut√©ed bell peppers, garlic toast, fries, and included chicken soup (ask for a side salad if that's more to your liking). Good value for $11. Service was prompt and friendly. I've also had Hawaiian and Greek pizzas here. Both were delicious."}
{"text":"Cheap prices, the place to go for your wing fix or party supple of wings for any get together. 

15wings & fries : $8.25

Half bucket of wings:$13.95
     25wings

Bucket of wings: $24.95
     50wings"}
{"text":"Yummy fresh pizza and wings. Everything tasted very authentic from the pizza to the Parmesan cheese and ranch. I loved it made me very happy. :)"}
{"text":"This was my second visit and everything was still great. Hands down an amazing pizza pie resteraunt. The tables are clean and the se quiet. tting is  Smooth jazz and classical music is playing in the background. We ordered the pizza of the gods. It was a 12\" deep dish with a delicious crust and a hardy layer of cheese. It was very filling with a layer of pepperoni, a layer or ham, a layer of salami, and a mound of peppers.  We also ordered the 8 oz steak, but it was not was plain and missing steak butter and seasoning.  I would truly recommend this place for pizza pie."}
{"text":"No mushrooms? I can deal with. WAITing for a cold pizza! I cannot! much less a bad cold pizza!  wierd, cuz the Calzone was great!  I wasn't gonna eat it after the Pie, but at midnight I remembered it was still in my trunk, and I was hungry, it was paid for!  How can the pizza suck, but the Calzone be great? go figure!"}
{"text":"I pretty much come here for the wings. they have 25+ wings for just 15$. yes i said plus.  the guy doesnt really count them when he grabs them so ive ended up with like 30 sometimes. the drumsticks are usually a little crunchy for my liking but i just eat the wings which are more tender and give the rest to my boyfriend. as for the pizza, is pretty basic but definitely better than any of your standard franchise pizza spots."}
{"text":"To my surprise this place was pretty good.  Got the meat livers which was loaded with toppings and extra cheese but light crystals not greasy."}
{"text":"Always very good place for take out any evening. Thanks for six and half years of great pizza or shall I say antipasto."}
{"text":"Grew up right by here and never been disappointed with the food or service. The odyssey special pizza is amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and chicken fingers. I definitely would recommend to come in and pick up your food instead of ordering delivery though, delivery takes a while but it could also have been the time I ordered. I ordered pretty late. The Stromboli is amazing and they have homemade ranch that I cannot go without when I order from here. One of my favorite pizza shops!"}
{"text":"Finding good pizza is a journey on its own. Thankfully you don't have to wait for the fall of Troy or defeat a cyclops to complete this odyssey. In fact all you have to do is go downtown and drive a few miles down on Fremont, and come to a nondescript blue and white building. You might question if you're in the right place, but trust your instincts because yes you are. Inside the pizza shop is very quaint. It has a very retro feel, in fact if I was told that nothing had been changed since 1994 I wouldn't be shocked. They even have a legit pac man/ donkey kong machine from the 80s. 
Now, most importantly is the food. The pizza is top notch. The crust is crispy, tasted hand tossed and well made. The sauce was ok, not bad but the cheese was oh so gooey and melty all inside my mouth. My test for a pizza is if it can hold its own without toppings and this passes with flying colors. I had the specialty pizza which had several meats and vegetables. I was too stuffed to truly appreciate the Stromboli but it gets a thumbs up. Your only excuse for not making it down here is if calypso imprisons you or Poseidon has a vendetta against you"}
