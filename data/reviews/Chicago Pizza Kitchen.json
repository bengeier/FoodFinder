{"text":"One of the true gems when it comes to great cuisine in this city.  It could have easily been featured on DDD (Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives).  And now I have to regretfully tell you that it has closed its doors.  All of it's going to be missed.  The food, the staff, Spiros and the incredible attention he pays to the quality of his product. It's a damn shame.  My only hope is that he reopens this place closer to the city where more people can learn to appreciate what this place has to offer."}
{"text":"So sad to hear this place is gone.. hope it's temporary..  guess we were lucky to have tried it in December just before the holidays  It was by far the best Chicago pizza I have had. I have been to Chicago and tried Giordano's and Gino's East and there is no comparison to Spiro's Chicago Pizza Kitchen creations.   All the ingredients are super fresh, they make the sausauge in house. The crust is magnificent (sour dough) same with the marinara sauce on top perfect.   Truly a pizza place that has attained grail status."}
{"text":"I'd never really had deep dish. Still can't guarantee this is authentic Chicago deep dish. But I can guarantee it's abso-effing-lutely delicious. Like, \"Don't eat all day so you can finish a full slice cos it will be worth it,\" delicious. We had the meat lovers pizza and one of my sons ordered the meatball sub. His sandwich came first (it's true, it does take time to get your pizza. We were warned - 30 minutes. So we conversed while we waited), and it was monstrous huge. It was also delicious. The meatballs are really good. The large meat lovers could easily feed 4 people, and we took a couple slices home. It's dense with meaty flavors and smothered with a really nice sauce, and the server told us that the cook said it was \"his best pizza of the day.\"  Made me wonder - do they tell everyone that?    Another plus - as a California girl I was very much looking forward to this \"American iced tea.\" I enjoy the sweet iced teas in places like the Rebel House, but sometimes I want plain old unsweetened Lipton. This was the real deal. Only thing that would have made it better would have been a lemon. Alas. No lemon slices at Chicago Pizza Kitchen. The lemonade is amazing, though. Super tart and sweet all at once. I ended up pouring a little into my tea. Not quite the same, but close.   The server was a bit too eager, but we overheard him telling someone at another table it was his third day on the job. The atmosphere was decent, though it was a little crowded in the dining area. The group at the table next to us complained about the lack of beer - they're not licensed. There is a sign proclaiming the pizza dough is made from a 30 year old sourdough starter from San Francisco, and apparently the owner is Californian."}
{"text":"I feel guilty giving just 3 stars to this place but I have to.  As much as I appreciate all the TLC given to the deep dish pizza and the disclaimer that it might take time to prepare, I find 35 mins. for a pizza when you're the only customer kinda disappointing. Add to that that I wasn't particularly that amazed with the pizza itself. It was good no doubt, but after all the suspense and expectations I put in my head, I was mentally prepared for a kickass dining experience.  I ordered the meatlovers coz I love meat. The toasted bacon bits toppings added a very pleasant element to the dish. It was a good pizza however, it has actually lowered my expectations if I ever have an authentic deep dish pizza in Chicago. Found to be a tad more expensive than it should be.  The restaurant itself has a very family feel to it. It's the kind of place you really want to succeed."}
{"text":"My husband had despaired of finding good pizza in Toronto. we both spent the last 8 years living in Illinois, so we have very specific ideas when it comes to pizza.  I came across this place on the chowhounds forums and I'm glad I did! The pizza is great Chicago style stuffed pizza. Not 100% what I was looking for, but that can be put down to personal preference rather than it not being authentic.  the place is clean and the workers/owners are friendly. when they heard we were from Illinois, they came out to say hi and ask where we were from.  My husband was thrilled at the American style ice tea. Toronto ice tea is good, but the stuff from home is even better.  We'll definitely be going back whenever the hubby gets a craving for pizza. Knowing my husband, it'll be soon!"}
{"text":"Just came across this place while looking for lunch.  A little hard to find as it's not inside the plaza but on the street side.  Now on to the food, I had the Chicago beef sandwich and I must say, this is one very serious sandwich!  It was very tasty, great bread, nicely spicy, just overall a great sandwich.  The potatoes with it were in a league all their own.  Absolutely recommend as a lunch place!"}
{"text":"Called into Spiro for the \"Classic\" Chicago Pizza ahead of time, as you know how us working types have to report back to our boss on time.  I FINALLY get to see how DEEP dish a deep dish Pizza really is and can finally compare to the only other I've ever had which is at Pizza Hut.  The Pie looks exactly like the photo posted on the website or menu and it is definitely a KNIFE & FORK affair.  The outside crust is nicely crispy while the inside is soften with the fillings of CAREFULLY layered ingredients.  \"Classic\" Pie means Home-Made Sausage that are layered at the bottom and comes in thick pieces, not like the CRUMBS that you see from Pizza Pizza.  On top of that Mushrooms, Green Peppers, and Onions while the Cheese layer on top of those topping selections was perfectly GOOEY sitting below a good Tomato sauce.  To a Chicago Pizza rookie like me, I'm glad this place exist to INTRODUCE me to something I've only heard of but never had the pleasure to experience.    The 3 of us should of went for a Medium as Spiro suggested.  It should also be NOTED that all sizes are cut into 8-pieces if you think you might have to FIGHT each other for the last slice."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled across an ad for this place randomly on the internet one afternoon, and I'm SO glad we did.  Since then we have been there 3 times, and introduced Chicago Pizza Kitchen to many of our friends who have also been blown away by the awesomeness of this place.  The deep dish pizza is absolutely INCREDIBLE. It is well worth the trek to Maple. The first few times we selected our own toppings, and the last time we were there we had the Meat Lovers Pizza, which was by far the best.  I've never actually had deep dish pizza in Chicago, so I can't really compare, but I can't imagine it being any better than the pizza here. 5 stars for the food, and 5 stars for the staff always being super friendly :)  Only thing is, each pizza takes about 25 minutes to make, so this isn't the type of place you go to for a quick pizza lunch. (However, they do have plenty of other menu options, including sandwiches which are great!)  For those patient enough to enjoy one of the best pizzas you'll ever have, load up on appetizers and trust me, it will be well worth the wait."}
{"text":"Spiro has indeed shut down but has relocated somewhere downtown and I would expect his website to get updated. I have not tried the pizza with the new owners but doubt they will do a chicago pizza. Being a pizzaiolo, its a lot of work to make and most wont spend extra money. Sprio is a true pizzaiolo with taking the time to source the best ingredients and be true to the art of making a real pizza. The 24 inch philly cheese steaks were a big hit with my kids.  where is he now?"}
{"text":"Just awesome!  The owner Spiro is from Chicago so the food is authentic, US style deep dish pizza AND philly cheese steaks!  Atmosphere is friendly, food is fantastic.  Be sure to try the garlic sticks as well.  They are actually deep friend pizza dough balls, covered in garlic oil and served with tomato dipping sauce.  Can't wait to go back...  Unfortunately Chicago Pizza Kitchen closed.  I heard that Spiro may open again in downtown Toronto... hope so!"}
{"text":"After leaving Canada's Wonderland I had a taste for pizza and I am a huge fan of Chicago Deep Dish.  This place was great and the owner and his wife were super nice!!!"}
{"text":"Several years ago I had Chicago style deep dish pizza in Chicago.  I honestly forget what it tasted like, though I do remember liking it, and that it was like a pizza pie (!) packed with... uh toppings or fillings... as it were.    Now, several years later, I have stumbled across Chicago Pizza Kitchen, and I don't care if it is authentic or not, I LOVE THIS PLACE.  Sure the dining room is small, but it's in a strip mall with limited space, what do you expect? Any way, don't let the space fool you, everything about this place is delicious and fresh.   The massive pizza pies are fantastic.  If you can't decide, go with the classic, it won't disappoint.  A medium will easily serve four people with regular appetites or two to three with bigger appetites.  There will be a lengthy wait time for the pizza (it is a pie at this point), but it is well worth the wait of about 30 minutes.  While you're waiting, you might as well treat yourself to the homemade unsweetened ice tea (not brewed everyday, but a delight for iced tea lovers at $2/bottomless glass), or some of the appetizers (the onion ring loaf and spicy ketchup are a nice choice, greasy but nice.)  Ultimately, I could easily take the safe route and recommend this place by saying \"if you want to try something different...\" but screw that.    If you want some great pizza, go here!    end of review."}
