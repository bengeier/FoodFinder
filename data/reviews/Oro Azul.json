{"text":"5/5 the man that owns this restaurant God bless his hard working soul, he cooks it from scratch and he serves you and even if he's busy he tries talking to you. The price is a little expensive for a tacon, but keep in mind this man is cooking it himself. It's great to come in the middle of the early afternoon when it's dead. Food is really on point, would never eat at Taco Bell ever again, or any fast food Mexican place. Although I believe he's trying to shut down the restaurant, he is still running a taco maker. Eat at the place while you still can!

Edit: Store is now closed and owned by Tacos Mexico all their food is microwaved and not as good as it was before"}
{"text":"First visit to Oro Azul last night and unfortunately it will be the last.  The food was mediocre with small portions for the price.  However it was the lack of professional service that will keep me from returning. The kitchen was not busy but our meals seemed to be cooked one at a time and brought to the table without any consideration taken to having everyone's meal arrive reasonably close in time. My wife and daughter received their meals and were completely finished before my son even received his food.  Likely a 20 minute difference between serving the first plate to the last. Waters that were requested for my kids took two reminders to arrive at our table and the knife and fork that my son requested never did arrive. I don't like to give small independent restaurants a bad review but Oro Azul really needs to try harder."}
{"text":"First off....I love the flavor of the tacos here & I love Las Tortillas BUT I think this new location is lacking in a few aspects. It's still basically a taco joint but the prices have gone through the roof. My husband got 2 tacos and a tamale & it was $14. No sides, no nothing. If it came with rice & beans, I would be fine to pay that. Without....no. I realize that they have great tacos and they are justifying a new space but I don't think the food will carry the pricing. 

For the price, I much prefer the taco place in the Crossroads Farmer's market. Now if they would just open 7 days a week."}
{"text":"Delicious chiken enchilada.  Friendly and knowledgeable staff."}
{"text":"Delicious Las Tortillas tacos in a nice room with service, beer and tequila. Count me in!

We stumbled across Oro Azul after finding a closed \"Las Tortillas\", only to find out that it is Las Tortillas! The owner told me that the Las Tortillas location no longer sells prepared Tacos, but is a retail store so people can buy their tortillas, and they supply the Oro Azul restaurant.  And what a fantastic experience we had!

I ordered three tacos and was very impressed by the huge difference in flavours. The Shrimp had some type of creamy melted cheese, the steak was topped with a spicy green salsa, and the Al Pastor, a sweet blend of pork and pineapple, with a medium heat red salsa to top it off. All of them were adorned with fresh onions, cilantro, and limes to squeeze on top. Fantastic!

Fresh, flavourful, and authentic tortillas, folded around delicious fillings and salsas. This was the taco experience I had been looking for.

Tacos go for $3.50 - $4.50 a piece, and three filled me up. Had I been feeling gluttonous, I could have handles a fourth one. A mexican beer goes for about $5. Total tab for a beer and beyond tasty tacos  - less than $20.

I can't wait to take more people here!"}
{"text":"After trying Oro Azul, (previously known as Las Tortillas, and located north of the Marlborough Mall), I discovered something:

The same awesome tacos as before!  They are explosions of flavour, and the prices are quite decent.  

Upon talking to the manager, I learned that they will soon be licensed to serve beer and tequila, and perhaps some other delicious drinks.

NE may suck in Calgary, but the variety of great food makes up for it."}
{"text":"expensive tacos and the fondito is just cheese and meat.  60$ for some street food is not what I'd call worth it.  go to mcdonalds and order 50 cheeseburgers.  The food is average mexican."}
{"text":"A little \"upscale\" compared to the LasTortillas store, which is still owned and operated by this great family, but it still offers some of the best tacos and tortas in the city."}
{"text":"Considering the lack of good Mexican food in Calgary, Oro Azul provides a pretty decent taste. The Tacon de Asada was very good, but the $13 price tag seemed a little high. I also tried the chips and salsa ($3), but nothing really notable to report. 

Overall, Oro Azul is worth the trip if you've got a serious craving for Mexican food. The prices are a bit high, but with the lack of serious competition in Calgary, I imagine they can justify them."}
{"text":"I liked the tacos. Owner is from Mexico so pretty authentic. Though the corn tortillas would fall apart if you didn't eat ti fast enough... but prob due to the fact that it's hard to get fresh corn tortillas here?... oh and dry weather ;-) haha.

Got the lengua, and the barbacoa taco.
Barbacoa was flavourful and loved the sauce, even had a kick to it.
Lengua was good too...it was lengua : ) haha.

But...I thought it was pricey. $3.95 per taco.  I expected like $2 or even $3...

We dined in, our tacos came with a plate of chips and salsa which was nice.

Love that they have Mexican sodas. Also I didn't see (so will have to get next time).. they have apple soda!!! :)

This first started at the Las Tortillas on Marlborough Dr (which is now just a grocery type corner store and they don't serve tacos anymore).  This is their brick and mortar restaurant where you get the tacos now... prob  that's why the price increase!
Parking available in strip mall lot.  (and may I just say that it is the most mutlcultural strip mall I have seen!  Mexican, Carribean, Japanese, halal butcher, Indian restaurant.... on and on!) haha.

4* for the tacos
3* for the price."}
{"text":"So I came back,  giving it another chance,  and just plain terrible,  food is okay, but what ruined it was that, my kid brought a happy meal from Mcdonalds and the owner said that needed to be thrown in the garage.. Never coming back."}
{"text":"Slooooooooooooooooooow service!
I had quite slow service on my first visit but the food was good enough to temp me to return. 
Now, after my second time here, I can't recommend it. It took my wife and I over 1 hour and 15 minutes to get our food. Our meals consisted of 2 simple tacos each. While the restaurant was fairly busy, it wasn't jammed packed. They only had one server and one person in the kitchen which clearly wasn't enough. Do not waste your lunch break on this place."}
{"text":"This place is by my work and I've been meaning to check it out. Menu is small but everything is made fresh and in house including their tortillas. I ordered the pork marinated with chipotle peppers taco and the chorizo taco. The pork was ok, not bad, not great. The chorizo was excellent. Will go back to try some of the larger items in the menu."}
