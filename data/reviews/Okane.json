{"text":"I ordered a pick up last weekend from Okane. They were really fast, my order was ready in 20 minutes! I was not expecting nothing great because sushi in Montreal is never great, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the sushi. Everything tasted really nice and fresh. It was probably one of the best sushis I have had in Montreal, and definitely the best out of all the delivery/pick up places. Price is not cheap, I believe it was around $25 before tax for a 24 pieces combo. I will be ordering from this place again in the future."}
{"text":"I've been ordering sushis for almost 2 years at Okane and I really appreciate the friendly service. The sushis themselves are pretty standard and do a good job for your weekday cravings. Don't expect anything out of this world in terms of creativity or flavours. Not overly expensive, I will keep ordering since its conveniently located and there is no other sushi place nearby."}
{"text":"Excellents petits sushis à prix raisonnables. Un cran au-dessus de la moyenne en termes de qualité."}
{"text":"Sushis are amazing, service is average. Too bad the owner does not appreciate loyal clients and this is why we do not go often anymore there. A very cheap attitude specially when some mistakes are made with food and he is used to seeing us at least twice a week spending almost 60$ each time."}
{"text":"Good for an average sushi place, very fast service for takeout. Don't expect any creative sushis. The menu is very basic and standard. I would say to stay with the safe choices such as salmon and tuna. I don't know if they sell enough of the other stuff to guarantee freshness. From the display from the sushi bar, I don't believe they do. By no means go out of your way for this place. I recommend it only for people who live or study nearby to satisfy a craving."}
{"text":"The reason I go to this place is because I live 2 min from there. The quality of sushi is not bad, but I can't say its great either! So yeah, if you're in the area, and are craving sushi, try this place! Btw they are very nice and friendly!! The only thing I don't like about this place is that their fried rolls are sometimes greasy."}
{"text":"Les sushis sont toujours bons! Très bon service également! Service rapide que ce soit en restaurant ou pour apporter."}
{"text":"Their sushi are on the bigger side and their price is reasonable. Unfortunately they're not very original for vegetarians. They only have one vege roll, the same roll fried and the usual : avocado roll and cucumber roll.  Carrots that were by the side of the plate were not fresh. Also, the wait took forever even if we were the only people in the restaurant (but I saw some people ordering at the counter so perhaps there was already a wait). Overall it was disappointing, mainly because I wished the sushi to show more variety and be tastier."}
{"text":"Came in for a quick sushi. The maki rolls are quite big. The sushi was not the freshest I've had but they were all right for a quick dinner. The service was good and the place is nice and colourful :-) . It's a bit pricy for what it is."}
{"text":"Small restaurant on Notre Dame, very basic decor. The variety of Sushi is limited, but you will find all the classics, kamikaze, California, etc.. beside Sushi for lunch they offer one choice of  meal ( today was General Tao)...I ordered a few Makis and some hand rolls... the fish is fresh and overall taste is good. Perfect for lunch our take out."}
{"text":"I don't think we could ever do all-you-can-eat sushi in Montreal again because when we order the a la carte from Okane (they only have a la carte) and we end up getting everything we would order and it ends up being cheaper than what we pay at all-you-can-eat places, and the quality is night and day. I'm sure there are many other great a la carte sushi places in Montreal, but I haven't had a chance to try them yet - but the all-you-can-eat places are terrible"}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I am not impressed.The waitress is not efficient. I ordered take out and asked her how much was the total and she said \"I don't know let me check, it will cost around 40$\". When I get there the bill was 60$ something.   The soft shell crab in my spider roll was burnt and tasted so bad. Will never come back!"}
{"text":"So far Ive experienced a slew of disappointments in sushi joints in town. One after the other being condemned as health hazardous locations.  This place is clean, sushi is big and prepared fast, service is kind and quality has always been fresh and top notch. A bit pricey for what Im used to but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Location: next to ÉTS and since I study there, pretty convenient for lunches.  Menu: basic sushi restaurant items.   Price: fair enough for lunch combos as well as dinner combos + à la carte add on. They give students discount which is a plus!   Portions: Sizes of sushi pieces are huge. Soups need to be more generous for the price.   Flavor: basic.. Nothing exceptional. Fresh and tasty.   Service: nice and friendly. Not a single complaint there.  Ambience: Lovely.   Overall, I like this place for the convenience of the location and decently flavored fresh food. I wouldn't travel far just for this place if I crave for sushi. There are better restaurants worthy of that."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant sushis, petite salle calme et très avenante au design contemporain, service impeccable et nourriture de haute qualité pour les papilles! À essayer absolument!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here as it was the close to us and had vegan options. The sushi here is amazing! I was shocked at how good it was. I'm not sure why the other reviewers gave it so low of a rating but this is a great sushi restaurant in Montreal."}
{"text":"Voici un petit Resto asiatique convenable situé sur la rue Notre-Dame ouest. Le menu offre une place prédominante aux sushis. En général, ils sont bien préparés et les prix sont très acceptables.   Comme c'est souvent le cas à Montréal, les propriétaires ne sont pas japonais mais vietnamiens. Ils ont donc ajouté des éléments de leur cuisine national au menu, ce qui donne parfois des mélanges un peu baroque (exemple : des rouleaux impériaux en entrée pour une assiette de sushi). La cuisine offre un grand grand choix de menu midi dont les prix varient entre 6.95$ et 14.95$. Le service est rapide et courtois.   En bref, on ne fait pas un détour pour venir manger des sushis ici, mais si on se trouve dans le coin, c'est une solution acceptable."}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had. Tasted like sugar with old fish. Do yourself a favour and DON'T go here!"}
{"text":"Sashimi was so fresh and delicious! Our waitress Ping was the absolute best. Truly made the experience the best! Gave us great recommendations for us Americans!"}
{"text":"Mediocre for the price.The rice was well done and nicely marinated.The rolls were big,and good amount of ingredients vs rice portion. BUT The taste though wasn't anything special. The fish didn't stand out! Also I found their so called lunch special expensive.For a lunch special about 20 bux u get like 6 small makis avocado and 6 bigger rolls.  I would not recommend it and don't think i 'll go back"}
{"text":"Ordered from Foodora and was reasonably satisfied. The sushi pieces, especially the unagi, were decently sized and fresh. Good level of vinegar in sushi rice. The shrimp in the shrimp tempura was good - though the batter was slightly thicker than to my taste. Price is fair. Quality is strong for delivery."}
