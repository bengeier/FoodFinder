{"text":"As per other users advice, I did try this place again. Their donuts were 100x better than last time. The only complaint I have is that the chocolate filling was not that tasteful in the chocolate filled donuts.   I will go back again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Donuts and pepperoni rolls are delicious. Staff is very friendly. My kids always ask to go here."}
{"text":"By far, the BEST donuts in town. They make fun flavors, and they're huge. Better quality than those chain donut shops - better flavor and prices, too. Love this little place!"}
{"text":"Always delicious donuts. The coffee, too, is spectacular! Good selection of various roasts, as well as lattes. For how scrumpdiddlyumptious everything is, as well as how much you get, you absolutely cannot beat the prices. When I get a specialty donut and 16oz coffee, it's rarely even $3 total. If you're in Elizabeth, go here EARLY; you won't regret it.  Also, the owner is extremely down to earth and personable. Businesses like this are exactly the ones I want to support, and I hope you will too!"}
{"text":"I stopped there this weekend for a dozen donuts for my family.  The service was very friendly.  I ONLY purchased donuts, I didn't try any of the other pastry items, of which there were several.  Most of the donuts were yeast donuts, some rings and some filled, with various glazes and toppings.  There was a small selection (six varieties) of cake donuts.  The TEXTURE of the donuts was outstanding, with just the right amount of firmness, outer crispiness, and inner airiness/moistness.  The flavor was good, but there was just a hint of an oily flavor, which suggests to me that although they are using a good batter and cooking it perfectly, their oil could use a change.  Most people would probably not notice the oil flavor.  Being partial to cake donuts, I would have liked to see a greater variety, and in something other than the standard yellow cake.  Chocolate, strawberry, pumpkin, blueberry...so many options.    Overall, this donut shop is off to a great start, and could easily gain more positive buzz with a little more variety and imagination!!"}
{"text":"One of the perks of my job is I get to travel throughout the county and stumble across bakeries and other small businesses I wouldn't normally visit. Yesterday's trek took me to Elizabeth and I was in for a treat.  Top O' the Mornin' Donuts & Coffee is located on a metered one way street along with other businesses.   It is a fairly small storefront, but welcoming.  There is a dining area.  The staff was friendly.    All donuts are $1 and there was a nice selection. I purchased a glazed cinnamon roll and it was tasty.  It was more moist the closer I got to the center of the roll. Had the entire roll tasted like the center piece, I would have given 5 stars.    I'll definitely return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"The donuts are fresh and basically perfect. We came in from NYC and we are very fanatical about egg and cheese on a roll and donuts.  Really we do not mess around. Neither do they. They donuts were soft and sweet and balanced. The sandwich was savory with the egg yolk just right. We will come back."}
{"text":"They've improved!  If you tried their donuts 6 or 8 months ago and didn't like them, give them another shot.  They've improved greatly and are now very good.  Not the best I've had, but very good and priced very nicely.    Basically this place is a very good value.  The food is decent, but dirt cheap and worth it.  The donuts however, are very good."}
{"text":"5 stars for quality and service! Not a fancy 5 star place. But just good and reliable. Excellent breakfast sandwiches made to order.  Fresh coffee, usually 4-6 different blends. And awesome donuts, with an eclectic variety of flavors.  They also do breakfast all day. Great prices and good food, what more can you ask for?  They don't often have cake donuts. But if you request them they can be ordered I think.  Why go to the convenience stores, when this little gem is right down the street. Only downside for me, they aren't open on Mondays."}
{"text":"The donuts and coffee are always exceptional. The breakfast is great too. I have been here multiple times, the service and food are consistently awesome. Definitely worth a try!!"}
{"text":"Best boston cream around. Has to weigh a half a pound. Fresh everyday. Open sundays close monday just sayin."}
