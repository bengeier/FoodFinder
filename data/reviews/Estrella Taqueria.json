{"text":"I don't know what happened to this place. It used to have a nice cocktail menu, great food, and great service. They are slowly reducing everything on their menu and are always \"out of X ingredient\" because they are \"busy\", which is just untrue.  I left my number for the pation, sat down for a Manhattan, and the waitress didn't even warn me they were missing an ingredient and served it to me, which is incredibly dishonest to a customer that knows what he's looking for. At least if they told me they were missing something, I would have ordered a different drink. Sending me a half completed drink is just pathetic.  After 2 hours, I wanted to check out the renovated patio, since we didn't get a table. When I went up, it was half empty. It boggles my mind why I didn't get a table up there.  I've been to Estella at least 6 times before and have given it decent reviews to my friends and family before this, but this place has become sad and pathetic. I will never come back."}
{"text":"So I have been curious to check out this place since it replaced Smokey Joe's. I have already been to El Catrin so I knew this place was not going to be as great as there, but the restaurant did not even fit my lowered expectations.  The decor was nice. They have managed to make this place look decent because Smokey Joe's was quite a mess. However, I'm not sure loud music goes well with the Mexican theme of this restaurant. If anything, it makes it feel less authentic. Would be nicer if it was a quieter environment with some traditional Mexican music.  The service was not that great. When we entered, the hostess was not there to greet and seat us. A waitress saw us but walked by without smiling or helping us. We sat ourselves. Our food came very late, so the service is not quite fast. Also, they mixed up one of our orders.   The food was average, definitely nothing special. The tacos are the size of a donut. I had the fish taco which I quite liked, but the fish looked too fried. I also had the pork belly taco, however I did not find it as great. I would definitely recommend the fish taco over the pork belly as it fills you up more and tastes better. I also got an order of churros and I was very disappointed. After having the churros, I was convinced the chefs must not be familiar with Mexican food because what I ordered looked a bit different than churros and it was hard and over cooked. It tasted fine, but I felt like I was eating a toasted cinnamon bread rather than churros. If you are looking to try authentic churros, stay away from the ones here!  Overall, this place is nothing special. I think there are better places to eat at in that area. I would rather eat at Jack Astor's than here to be honest."}
{"text":"I LOVE Mexican food and I really wanted to like this place. We were a table of four, seated at the patio and ordered the guacamole while looking over the menu. The waitress then told us that about half the menu was not available because they had run out of ingredients and hadn't received the next delivery (What? On a sunny/warm weekend afternoon!?! Sounds like poor management). We settled for a selection of tacos and the ribs. The guacamole was good, made at the table, so it's fresh and tasty. The rest of the food took so long we thought the order had been lost. It's not like the place was packed. Nobody on the main floor and 3-4 tables on the patio. Overall, food was tasty, but it should not take that long. Wonder how they handle a busy weekend night and the place is huge! I may try again, but don't think I'll become a regular."}
{"text":"The common denominator is everyone seems to want to like this place and nobody does. What that tells you is the idea of a Mexican taqueria in this place is great, but the execution is poor.   I had the same experience as well. The Yonge and Sheppard area is growing fast and is finally starting to see the dining diversity and nightlife that more downtown areas have. A taqueria seems like a natural progression.   However, the food is simply subpar, the tacos are under quality and extremely overpriced. The service is poor, waitstaff seems to not understand the food or even how to explain it. The music when it's playing is blaring, it's uncomfortable and you can not hear anything.   The only good part is their tequila, mescal and bourbon selection. I had a good discussion with a bartender here once and he educated me on several difference mescals. It was a promising sign that was ruined with subsequent visits.   There are also other positives such as an interesting ping pong section and lots of space (for dancing, roof top patios etc) and great decor.   However, these positives are significantly outweighed by the negatives of this place. Better food, better servers and a better price and the potential for this place is high.   At this stage though, I will not return."}
{"text":"Been here twice. The first time near the grand opening and everything was great. Returned recently and the place was empty during weekday lunch. I suspect their prices are not competitive for a business lunch. The guacamole is still delicious and their corn fritter tacos are yummy but it ends there. Tried their ceviche it was bland and just tasted of citrus. Tried their pork belly and it was dry and not tender. Tried their short rib and though the flavours were there, it was tough and not braised long enough or perhaps from the day before. I likely won't come back again because for the price, it's not worth the mediocre experience. A shame too! Seemed like a great addition to north York."}
{"text":"I went here tonight for dinner and drinks with my wife and another couple.  This is my review - and I wasn't paid to say this.  Service was excellent.  Atmosphere was very relaxed. The drink list was impressive and we weren't charged for tap water like other reviewers have lied about.  We ordered guacamole, chorizo quesadilla, fish tacos, short rib tacos, some steak, and bean dip.  Everything was delicious and complimented our drinks nicely.  We had some bourbon, sangria, and followed it up with beer.   Once we we're full, we played some ping pong and had a lot of fun.  Basically, read those other reviews with caution.  Especially the ones that are by people who only have one negative review under their belt - they are likely jealous competition or someone paid by jealous competition.    I have a receipt to prove everything I described above...."}
{"text":"The pork belly taco is not very good. Too much fat. The fish taco is ok though very fried. I hope the owners read these reviews and revamp the menu. The tacos are small for the cost but it's 2 for 1 with a drink on Tuesdays."}
{"text":"Poor quality food. Tacos are literally pitas from the supermarket topped with ground beef and unauthentic garnishes.  Fish, short rib, regardless poorly seasoned and mediocre at best.  For an authentic experience try playa cabana on Dupont street or el sol on Danforth.     Positives: Friendly staff Good hot sauce selection but charge extra Good Guac Ping Pong table and Patio"}
{"text":"So just a heads-up, this is a negative review based on a nightmare-ish experience.   I neglected posting this for about 6 weeks, just to see if I'd change my mind. And honestly, I instead shared my dislike for the service to every other foodie friend. I hate to be that guy but here we go:  It was a group of 9 for a friends birthday. We all ordered, starting with apps: an order of guac and nachos. Honestly, I've had the whole table side guac before and the only unfortunate thing was that the guac was barely palm sized (There were still a few chunky pieces at the end!). I think we made it through 1/4 of the nachos before it was done.  We also each ordered between 2-3 items each (specials or tacos) and after 30 mins we had received 5 items. And then after another 10, a server came with more of our orders indicating \"here's all your tacos...\"    A total of 7 tacos. We were missing 11 tacos. 11.   We followed up and two of my friends decided to cancel their two and the remainder didn't arrive until 20 mins later.   I have a general rule of not visiting a new restaurant when they open because they are still working through logistics and how their recipes are received by general public (eg momofuku toronto). But honestly, my friend said it's been open for 2 months and aside from the pork belly and the duck confit (both with good flavor), everything else was just meh.  No attempts were made to apologize for the mishap (there have been restaurants that have won me back with attentive customer service)   I didn't have any but my friends also said don't bother with the sangria - it's too sugary and it looked like they skimped out on the fruits.   Sorry for the harsh review. It is what it is."}
{"text":"My gf and I came here as she had heard about the place - decided to try it out.  Decor is really nice - well lit, nicely done. You can go play table tennis while waiting for your food (really nice touch) - so didn't mind waiting slightly extra for the food. The place was slowly getting full - means they get business.  The server was super nice but didn't know the drinks menu well - they say ask about the daily special but he had no clue. Anyways, had some tequila and beer. At least he redeemed himself when he refilled our dip for free.  Food - this is where I got lost. Tiny little tacos - pretty much bite-size. Flavor was absolutely missing. Really disappointing. Had the dessert ice-cream which had a nice big fat piece of frozen ice in it. Small portion as well.  I am not a fussy eater - but if the food is nothing special, I expect a small price. But not the case here. One of those little tiny bite-size tacos is around $6. To get a decent meal you need minimum 4 - good luck paying $24 for some tasteless tacos.   Giving this place 2 stars only because of the nice decor and the concept with the table tennis. Otherwise hard to give points on anything.  And to end it - credit card reader was not working. Good thing I had some cash on me."}
{"text":"Came to the recently opened Taqueria on a dreary rainy weather to seek some refuge and munch on some lunch...albeit late!   The very spacious restaurant is definitely a step up from former resident Shoeless Joes!     Ordered their guacamole and Baja fish tacos, which were both quite good. The Guacamole was very impressively made/minced infront of me by the hostess! The tastes of a few chunks was overwhelmed by lemon, which is a small price to pay for freshly made Guac.   The taco is priced quite appropriately for its size! For $4.95 you can't and shouldn't expect a ginormous tortilla now can you!!! I do however wish that their batter wasn't as deeply fried. The condiments with it were great. It was just that the fish was a little too hard for my liking.    Service was great! Fast and courteous and they even provided me with the Wifi Password!   Will def be back to try their pork belly taco and short rib tacos and to take advantage of their sprawling space with groups!  Great place especially in the neighborhood but has room to improve!"}
{"text":"I was super excited when this place opened up walking distance to my home. I love Mexican food and we typically have to trek quite a distance when I have a craving.   The concept is great! A cool place to have casual Mexican fare, and solid drinks. The decor is well done and hits the mark in achieving quite the atmosphere. This place has a ton of potential.  With that said, there is work to be done. I'm basing this on two Friday night visits.   The service: there are to many servers, who all seem to be confused. I think our table was approached by 4 different people and we were asked the same questions a few times. As a result no one could track where we were with our meal, and on a couple of occasions thought we were done while we were waiting for a food order someone else took. Also, we weren't asked if we wanted more drinks, or dessert after the meal. I think this organization issue can be fixed pretty easy with some training and better defined zoning. This is not a huge deal to me personally, as all the servers were really nice.  The food: we had a small nachos, which were very good  and priced well at $6. On the 2nd visit we tried some tacos (short rib and fish). The short rib were quite good, but the fish taco was quite bland and a bit fishy, which was particularly disappointing to me. Drinks every time were a bit small but delicious - done right. I would love to see a larger version of their yummy margarita!  Overall, we had fun here. I hope they keep working on it, because they are definitely on to something. A few tweaks could make this one of the great bars in Toronto."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I happened to come upon an article about this restaurant in Toronto Life and was super excited that my home area would be getting a \"cool\" Mexican/Taco joint. After all the Grand-Electric/El Catrin-like Taco joints popping up in the downtown area, it's time the \"North\" got some much loved attention.  Unfortunately, my experience at Estrella was such a let-down. As Kat V. put it so appropo, this place really is a \"Mexican version of Smokey Joe's.\"  Friday night my friends I were in the Yonge and Shep area, and I really wanted to try this place. It was about 8:30pm and when my bf and I drove by, it didn't seem like there was anyone was at the restaurant! I saw the \"Opening Soon\" sign and I thought to myself, shoot, it's not open yet! But we saw someone walk in and we soon followed.  FYI! Have your ID ready, because there is a bouncer right at the door. Is this a club? This place is split into two/three levels? The main floor is a busy, loud and lively place and the friendly hostess asked if we wouldn't mind sitting upstairs. Of course not! I actually found it to be quieter. Now, I realize why she asked me so pleadingly if I wouldn't mind sitting upstairs, because for 15 minutes, no one came to us. I had to ask my boyfriend to go down to get someone. Our waiter had forgotten about us. Not a good start, especially when you have 4 hungry people.  The menu is a one pager and features a variety of tacos: Fish, Duck Confit, Chicken Tinga, Pork Shoulder and Belly, etc... My friends decided to order all the taco's on the menu to try. In the end, all our fave's was the Fish Taco. I really liked the Chicken Tinga as well as it had a real kick to it. My least favorite was the Duck Tack: dry, shredded pieces of meat.  There was some mix-up with the tacos as we had initially ordered 8, but only 7 came. It took a while for the last one to come, but it eventually came, when we had finished our second round of tacos. Better late than never I guess.  We also ordered the Guacamole which is prepared table-side. Forget about ordering this. It was basically mashed avocado with no flavor. For 4 people, this dish is incredibly small; So much so that we decided to order the Nachos which was smothered in meat and cheese. Gooey and filling, but nothing special.   What I do like is their drinks menu as variety is the name of the game: Tequila's, Bourbons, Beers, Cocktails, mixed drinks...you name it. Our table decided to order a pitcher of Sangria, and I would also pass on this. All our friends commented that it was really watered down: half the pitcher was ice. We didn't taste the booze at all.  Would I come back here again? Maybe just for drinks, but service was just really bad. Forgotten, mixed up orders on already mediocre food, and watered down Sangria. I noticed that our waiter also served the downstairs area, which meant a lot of tables for him, so not necessarily his fault. He seemed really rushed when it came to our table.   So again, I really wanted to like this place. I think it's a great new addition to this area, amidst all the Moxie, Milestones and Japanese/Korean restaurants. But, on that note, this place could be so much better. It's not authentic by any means, so don't expect a family-run casita serving home-style food. I don't think restaurant is marketed as that, but rather, some place big and loud: the main floor turns into a club-like atmosphere late at night, so I would definitely would come here for drinks and a bite.  If you want service, I would recommend sitting down on the main level. Our waiter commented that service was a bit off because this place was new. My advice? If you're not prepared, don't open."}
{"text":"Whoever thought of this idiotic idea to buy off Smokies and put a \"high end\" Mexican restaurant is completely out of his mind! I will give you a year to survive maybe 2 if you got enough cash in your pocket.  Twick this place, and do it fast! If you need help let me know.  First of all if you are planning to check this place out with a party, STAY AWAY.  I came in with a guest of 8, they take orders left and right, drinks and food, whatever is ready comes out so if your friend is eating you may expect your food in 5-10 minutes, and while your friend is eating he probably also got his drink 5 minutes later, service is very UNORGANIZED, no order, nothing.  Get your stuff together.  When I said \"high end\" Mexican I meant that for the price of the dishes, over$5 for a taco that i can finish in 1 bite is ridiculous, also burnt quesadilla that are tasteless with some sort of tomatoes paste.  They are trying to make money by saving food cost in a horrible kind of way.  The only thing good might be your tortilla chips and nachos, but even that is bland and your sour cream is some cheap imitation.   For any sort of fancy drinks, stay away, the quality isn't there.  Like I said, you won't survive if you don't start making some changes, also for the kind of space you have, you have done a pretty bad job.  For that space a club is the only way to go."}
{"text":"The setting was relaxed and busy, however the service and food was lacking. The server brought all the food out together, despite our request for entrees then mains, and charged us for tap water yet didn't charge the table next to us (?!). The meals were small, and overpriced."}
{"text":"Expensive tacos for what you get in both quality and size.  Duck Confit taco was super dry unless you enjoy the consistency of jerky.  On the flip side the Duck leg entrée was very good and probably the only item I would order again. Nachos, Gaucamole, Quesadilla were....meh."}
{"text":"Came here tonight to enjoy the beautiful weather. The patio was pretty awesome. However we came to eat and they told us they ran out of food because they didn't realize how busy they would be. I thought she was joking. It probably would have been nice if someone told us this when we got there instead of waiting around. Epic fail"}
{"text":"They have a nice selection of tequilas at a reasonable price. However the server who was serving us last night (girl with pink hair) who said she's normally the bartender had no clue on what tequilas they had available. Maybe she just needs a bit more training, but I would definitely not want my drink made by her. The guacamole was bland. It was basically an unseasoned crushed avocado with tomato on top, no salt no lemon no nothing. I could've made this at home for less than half the price. Plus the guacamole girl could hardly crushed the avocado she kept moving the table and even spilled the drinks from the table beside us, which she didn't even bother to clean up. The tacos are 5 dollars per taco and you only get one, and they taste once again bland. I was also surprised no salt was given for our tequila shots. I'm not sure what this restaurant or bar is trying to be, I will definitely not go back or would recommend this to anyone. Don't have much more to say about the food because it was nothing memorable, way too expensive for mediocre bar food.  If you love Mexican food don't waste you time trying this place out, you'll leave disappointed! I wish I would've gone to Playa Cabana or Milagros instead."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were really excited to try this place out because there is nothing else like it in the area but maybe we hyped it up too much in our heads. We arrived around  6:30 PM on Nov.  2nd for dinner and were seated immediately. The decor and vibe of this place almost got it 3 stars but the main attraction, the food and drink, was quite mediocre.   Sangria is one of my favourite drinks and it was definitely sub-par at Estrella ($7). The fruit wasn't macerated so there was just a ton of chopped, raw apple and ice. The drink itself was too sweet, watered-down and lacked red wine flavour.  For dinner we ordered two tacos each (~$5 per taco) and the hot sauce sampler ($6). The sampler came with a basket of chips and four different hot sauces. The chips and sauces arrived probably 10-15 min after the tacos, and only after we inquired about them a few times. I was a little annoyed because how long could it take to fry chips and plate sauces? The tables around us received their orders long before our chips came and I just wish they prioritized our missed, easy, order before firing other dishes. We really wanted to put hot sauce on our tacos (which needed it) so after we tried each taco we sat there and waited. Not worth the wait. The chips were very greasy and almost translucent. The sauces were decent and fun enough but again, not really worth it. Retrospectively we should have just cancelled the order since it took so long and we didn't even finish it because the chips were too heavy to enjoy.  The tacos were the best part of the dinner. We ordered two pork belly (de panza), one fish and one pork shoulder (al pastor). The al pastor was my favourite and I  really liked the cilantro in it. The fish one had quite a lot of fish and it was tasty enough, although much improved with the addition of hot sauce. The pork belly was probably the weakest and a little one-note in terms of flavour. The belly itself is advertised as braised and I expected it to be soft but it was hard and oily. The tacos were all larger than we expected so we were pretty full by the end of it.  The environment was nice with the DJ and decor but you can tell it gets club-like at night, which is something I'd personally avoid. If you're into that scene though it'd definitely be worth checking out. Overall, I totally see the appeal but at $5 a taco with everything being pretty okay I don't know if I would be back often. If the food was a little cheaper I would've given this place 3 stars instead of two. Since I live in the area I might drop by for a cocktail and a taco but it'll be at least a few months before I have a full meal at Estrella again."}
{"text":"*** CLOSED ***  There is justice in the world. I'm sure someone lost a shit ton of money on this venture. But I lost time and money visiting this shit hole. It's one of the few dead restaurants I want to dance on the grave of. It was such an awful experience, from start to end. Hopefully, the owner takes a powerful lesson out of this business failure and goes back to school for Dentistry or something.  *** CLOSED ***  My GF and I noticed a taqueria had opened in this location and had made mental notes to try it. It seemed new enough that I didn't think it had many Yelp reviews. I wish I checked yelp reviews before dropping money here. Ugh. My impression is this place is on auto pilot. Success is just about showing up, right? Tables, beer, deck, smear crap on soft tacos. Haul the ol' money to the bank!   The tacos. First, zero flavor. Second, the ground pork was clearly reheated. It was all clumped together. Third, no hot sauce. The wait staff seemed to be clueless you might even want some hot sauce for your tacos. They promised (yeah \"they\" more about that later) to see what was in the kitchen. You can get salsas but they charge some crazy amount extra. For salsa. That's like charging extra for a bottle of ketchup. The soft tacos come out soggy and break apart when you pick them up.  Fourth, dry limes. How do you manage that? Hoping to add some zest to our supposed chipotle tacos we tried to squirt on some lime juice. We each maybe got a drop out of each of our limes.   The \"gringo\" tacos seemed kind of a negative upsell. Kind of like categorizing your more expensive food items under \"stupid white people food\".   We had about 4 people working our table and even that group effort couldn't get anything done right. No cutlery for our nachos app. We had to ask a couple times. They have Mexican sodas although the waitress had no clue what flavors were available and they didn't seem to see fit to write in on the menu. And it took several tries to get hot sauce, which ended up being plain old tabasco sauce and a thumb print of chipotle mayo. Seriously if you visit this place PACK YOUR OWN HOT SAUCE AND LIMES.   Please, if you're the owner and reading this, please do North York a favor and get out of the restaurant business. As I said, success isn't about just showing up. It's about understanding every aspect of your business. I really got the impression you've not bothered to take that time."}
{"text":"Alright. I, too, wanted to really like this place. The customer service was not a complaint for me. In fact, she was so friendly and helpful especially for the size of our group .   The street artist work for the interior is beautiful . Really worth seeing.  Now, the food was just so flat. Sure it was cooked , fried and meat was tender but and this is a huge thing for me - everything was dry and lack the  flavour I'm used to with Mexican food. Took me completely by surprise.  The lime definitely saved the flavour for the shrimp.   Even the Mexican rice - dry and lacked flavour.  The taco should be the star that makes or breaks a taqueria - oh, boy. I chose to eat my meal taco less . Hate to say this but it tasted like cardboard. I also had it as a nacho - even deep fried it couldn't mask the cardboard flavour. Don't get me wrong - it helped. Was probably my favourite thing and the salsa it came with I was happy with.  I wanted to like it but Grand Electric beats this place by a mile."}
{"text":"I felt a bit hesitant to write this review at first, but felt it necessary given my experience at Estrella Tacqueria.  We went on a Tuesday evening for our dinner drawn in by the special 2-for-1 taco promotion.  However, we were disappointed to find out when we got to the restaurant that the deal only applied to the taco featured that evening (which for us happened to be the Short Rib taco)  The short rib taco itself was fairly good.  The spice on it was a bit overwhelming, but quality was average to other short rib tacos I've had.  The food went significantly downhill from there.  We ordered guacamole prepared tableside.  The novelty was nice but unnecessary.  The guac lacked significant flavor, and the chips it came with were spiced very poorly (heavily drenched in Paprika), and were exceptionally oily.  I got a mouthful of oil when I bit into a bubble in one of the chips.  My girlfriend asked not to have her tacos with any cheese in them--yet, when we received our order two of the tacos had cheese.  The duck confit taco had overdone chewy duck with a very sour and unappealing slaw, the Ceviche taco had a bitter flavor that actually had me spit out my food, the Coconut Shrimp taco was overdone and heavily battered, and although the Mexican beef taco did have a good flavor, it was reminiscent of what you'd find in an Old El Paso seasoning mix.  The service itself was quite good--the waitstaff were courteous, attentive and warm.  When we gave feedback about the food, they gladly took the items we mentioned off the bill. I would not have written this review had I not gotten sick right after eating in the restaurant.  I would not recommend this restaurant until the quality of their food significantly improves."}
{"text":"This is an updated review after going back here a few more times, including with a larger group of coworkers.  The larger group experience was a complete disaster!!!  The admin booked the reservations and Estrella advised that they would need to bring in an additional chef to accommodate the group (the group was 15 people).  Here is why this place is completely empty at lunch.  It takes forever, I mean 30-45 minutes from sitting down to getting the food.  The \"deals\" that they have make no sense.  It's $14 for 3 tacos, and normally $5 for one, so you save $1 for getting 3 tacos.  They also have this other deal where you get 3 tacos for $10, but it has to be the same kinds of tacos.  Our group lunch was disastrous because the food took forever to come out and half of the group was fed first.  The specials were not explained correctly and the server wanted to re-take all of the orders.  The server also assumed that we wanted 3 tacos when we ordered 1 taco.  She said we had to specify 1 taco, if we wanted just 1.  Um... even McDonald's gets that one right.  When I go to McDonald's to order the Big Mac, I get 1 sandwich, not the combo, or 3 Big Macs.  Great venue, and I think the patio will be awesome, but I sure hope they get it together before the summer!"}
{"text":"Another place that is difficult to give a star rating to. It has the potential to be great, but as it stands now I think it risks going out of business.  As many people have mentioned in previous reviews, this place seems to be a bit confused about what it wants to be. On the one hand it has a sort of wooden rustic feel with ping pong tables in behind, but on the other hand it has very expensive dishes and a palate consisting of duck and specialty seafood.  I'm not sure it's trying to be authentic, because after living and travelling within Mexico for a total of 4 months, I don't think I've seen or tasted anything quite like what Estrella has to offer. It's more of an interpretation of traditional tacos. Their food is certainly delicious, but at $4.95+ for one tiny taco I didn't feel as though I was getting my money's worth when I was sitting in uncomfortable wooden bench/chairs and talking over loud music.   What I don't think they realize is that your average person who is paying for an expensive meal, wants to have a nice atmosphere to be paired along with it. Whether it comes in the form of a comfortable chairs or an intimate environment. This restaurant's image is more appropriate for Happy Hours or college hang out. And no one going out to a place with a ping pong table is going to want to pay $37 (but advertised as $27 on the website! [Uncool]) for a pitcher of sangria!!  Unless I heard they adjusted their prices (which could probably only happen after they lowered the quality of ingredients in their tacos), I would probably save my money and go somewhere else for the price."}
{"text":"I was so happy to find a Mexican restaurant coming to North York, I was simply ecstatic. So as soon as I spotted lights inside Estrella I rushed in to check it out. My verdict: it's simply a Mexican version of Smokey Joe's that occupied the walls previously, that means the booze and vibe are worthy of pub crowd's attention, but dinner is better be sourced else where.  Decor: Great job on revamping the old place, there's a variety of seating options, from booths to hight tables and even a small hang out corner, not a single square inch of space was wasted. Art works on the walls are funky and definitely bring Día de Muertos closer to home.   Food: Very weak, almost everything needs improvement. All three tacos we tried were on a dry side and boring on flavour. Guacamole is spiced with some sort of spicy oil? not fresh peppers. Grilled jalapenos were unremarkable if not oily. Bean dip is the only dish we enjoyed. And that would have been ok, had I not spent all night with a stomach ache after eating at Estrella, sadly the other party reported similar symptoms.  Alcohol: Surprisingly a great selection of booze, great beer list that goes from best Mexican varieties to Belgian ales and some Canadian crafts. Cocktails sounded delicious and emphasis on bourbon and tequila is greatly appreciated. I'll come back to try their Sangria and Mojito. So if you're thirsty, that's the place to be.  Atmosphere: The vibe was amazing. The space is big enough to diffuse crowd buzz to a comfortable level and DJ did a fantastic job spinning tunes from around the globe keeping the spirits up and moving to the grooves. I hope he'll become a regular thing at Estrella. There are also pinpong tables for your amusement as well as nice tv screens to watch a game.  Overall: Would have been a solid 3 had I not gotten so sick after eating here. I'll be back for more drinks and maybe test food options on my other friends."}
{"text":"I was full of hope for this place especially wen looking through their menu online. Sadly this is another one of those Mexican restaurants that try to cash in on the trend of fresh Mexican food but fails miserably in execution.   First of all we were here as a small group of four with some kids on a quiet Sunday evening. It was not busy at all and the server to table ratio was pretty high. This made our slow and poor service pretty inexcusable. Wait staff were far from attentive. Water was not refilled, drinks took forever, we constantly had to flag them down.  First horror, when you pay money for chips and guacamole, the chips should be fresh and tasty. Wow, our first basket of chips was an oily soggy mess. Chips were matted together and generally disgusting. Attentive staff would have noticed before serving. On request they cheerily replaced with a fresh basket. The guacamole was fine. For some reason though they kept coming to ask if we were done with the guacamole bowl. If you have limited fancy mortars either get more or serve in a bowl you are less eager to retrieve.   Perhaps coming back from a recent visit to Texas and Mexico has skewed things, but their tacos were an over priced over salted mess. We tried all the specialty ones. The pork belly was the most acceptable of the lot. But c'mon it is hard to mess up pork belly.   Did I mention the super poor value margarita? I get it you want to push people to buy a pitcher. My tiny water cup of drink was really not worth the $7.   If you are in the are I guess this is an ok place but I would not go out of my way to come here."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for some Mexican cuisine with a friend. We were sold from the drive by that they had a roof top patio and the weather was so nice. We were super disappointed we did not have a few of the busy yonge street. We felt like we were inside a jail cell.   I ordered a grapefruit margarita and was shocked to see in come in a water glass.. so upsetting they didn't take pride in their presentation. It was tiny and nothing special. My friend also ordered a pina colada and it was tasty just not in the right glass.  We decided to go with the 3 taco's for 14 dollars. We ordered two coconut shrimp and one duck. I was upset at how over cooked and deep fried the shrimp was. So dark and just didn't look right. The shrimp taco and the duck was soo plain in flavour. No taste and I was actually turned off.  If I ever go back it would only be for a pint or two and that's it.. there was nothing special about this place!!"}
{"text":"This is better than your typical Mexican restaurant. They have a nice selection of Reposado Tequilas.   The Guacomole is freshly made at the table, a bit mushy but still with some big lumps. We liked the texture. We ordered the spicy one and in my opinion was improved by a couple of dashes of their green hit sauce.   The Mexican fried chicken was hot and crunchy and nice and juicy inside. The plate was nicely garnished with a hot sauce. This definitely adds to the fried chicken.   We will definitely be back."}
