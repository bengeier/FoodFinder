{"text":"Gumi is a sweet, authentic little Korean/Japanese restaurant at Lawrence and Pharmacy.  Tucked into an unassuming strip mall with a shawarma place and a Lebanese bakery, Gumi delivers good, fresh sushi and Korean BBQ.  The inside is well laid out with lots of little private booths, and has a quaint pseudo-Japanese feel about it.  I got Gyoza for starters and the sashimi lunch withTempura, and it was fantastic, the tempura was perfectly crisp without being oily as was the gyoza.  The tuna was delicious and fresh, but the salmon and red snapper were a little old. There was also some cold/rubbery unagi as the 4th fish, which I could have done without.  The service was friendly but a little slow, considering the place wasn't very busy.  I love the little appetizer dishes that Korean restaurants put out as soon as you order, these ones were fresh and the kimchi was spicy and delicious.  All in all, this place was excellent for a workplace lunch, and with Dolsot Bi Bim Bap (one of the planet's most perfect meals) for less than $10, I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"I've had the displeasure of eating at this restaurant since it was close to my high school and I was naive.   I recently ate at this restaurant again a few weeks ago and I think it's safe to say that I'll never be returning.   I've tried a lot of the things on the overextensive (around 200-300 items on the menu) and so far the food has been mediocre at best.   What really ticked me off last time though was how the waittress apparently had the audacity to demand for a tip from me and my dinner companion while I was in the bathroom.   Avoid this restaurant at all costs."}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER SUSHI/SASHIMI AT THIS PLACE!!!  This was my first visit to this resto, and I was very disappointed.  I'm a sushi/sashimi enthusiast, and I feel that this restaurant should just stick to making Korean Food.   1. The menu had only 2 pages of Japanese food and 5 pages of Korean. (I should have taken this as a sign NOT to order any Sushi/Sashimi... but i thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt).  2. I ordered the Sushi & Sashimi Dinner ($18+). It came with Miso soup and a side salad.  Sashimi: The White Tuna (or Butter Fish) was still rock solid frozen, my Octopus also frozen, Salmon was ok, Tuna had with parasites/worms VISIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE.  Sushi: Fish tasted old and rubbery, and it was the same fish as the Sashimi. I guess they went with a safe, standardized selection of what the area's demographic is used to, but a variety would have been nice.  3. My friend ordered the specialty Makis (Rainbow rolls, etc). They were ok, except they use korean hot pepper sauce (gochoo jang) instead of Japanese spicy mayo for their spicy rolls.  If you're ok with fusion foods, it's not bad.  4. They do not have a desserts.  They give a piece of chocolate instead of mints to each person with the bill.    I did not feel that the meal was worth what I paid at ALL. Perhaps if I had just ordered the Korean food, I would have had a better experience."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for 4 years now. The service was much better before i have to say. Recently I went there and ordered two spicy tuna roll 5.99$ each. They tasted awesome but the size got smaller. Also the price for the regular bento combo keep on going up and the portion size seems to get smaller every time  go there. The most annoying thing I noticed at the counter when I went to pay bills. I paid 2$ tips for my 12$ food which should be enough for 10% tips and every time they seems to ask more. I don't understand how can they ask and get rude about the tips when it should be to the customers if they want to pay for their good service or not. I don't mind paying tips if the service was good but they don't seems to care about the service anymore. I would definitely not go there anymore. I have seen much better sushi buffet in Toronto where you can get unlimited sushi and sashimi for the same price."}
{"text":"this is my favorite restaurant, but unfortunately they closed and new indian restaurant opened the place."}
{"text":"I've recently discovered Gumi because of my work colleagues who often frequent this Korean/Japanese restaurant. When the place is not super busy and the staff isn't overwhelmed, the service is friendly and if you're in a booth, ring the bell and service is almost instant. My favorite dish is the Dolsot Bibimbap and all the condiments that come before the dish. Will be back."}
{"text":"Decent place, have a party room at the back for larger events.  Food is consistent.  I generally order the hwae dup bap and it's always fresh and the gochuchang perfectly vinegared.  Not the greatest variety fish-wise, but what they have is fresh.  Very pleasant Sushi Man and wait staff.  Have had the hot dishes there as well and they are ok.  Panchan - nothing special.  Consistent.  Not overwhelmingly memorable but consistent and not terrible either."}
{"text":"Returned again to Gu-mi today and something very weird has happened.  Every portion of everything has shrunk to half it's normal size.  Even the miso soup was a measly tiny portion.  Not sure if this place has fallen on tougher times and is trying to trim the fat, but for the price, this place is no longer such a good deal."}
{"text":"Gu-mi Restaurant is a Japanese/Korean restaurant in Scarborough run by Koreans.  During a snowy Saturday evening, I dropped by for an early dinner. I greeted warmly by one of the waitress and surprising allowed to sit in one of those private room/booth.  The menu offers a good selections of Korean and Japanese dishes at a very reasonable even at dinner time. I could not decide what to eat because everything sounded delicious in the menu.  I asked the nice waitress should I have sushi or Soon Tofu Seafood Soup ($7.99). without any hesitation she said \"SOUP\", yes on a cold winter night that does sounded perfect!!  Nice Standard banchans... and the soup arrived bubbling hot. The soup itself tasted pretty good, but the seafood were small..small little pieces of squid, shrimps... and not plentiful...not bad.. but not as good as other Soon Tofu's Speciality restaurants.  By the time I was leaving, Gu-mi has a full restaurant of Korean patrons enjoying their dinner!!"}
