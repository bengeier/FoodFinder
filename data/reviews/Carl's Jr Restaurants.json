{"text":"Beware prices on menu are less than those in computer. They are charging more than advertised. Mangers are aware an if you complain they will tell you to come back tomorrow?  Easy thing would be to fix issue then but no the manager tells me to bring my receipt back tomorrow to get the over charges refunded.  Why even have a manager?  So price for all American on menu is $5.79 for the 1/3 pound the computer rings up $6.39. Be sure to check your receipt then be prepared for an argument if you want it corrected.  They are aware of it because its now happen to me twice.  Tonight I just asked for my money back and left discussed with the ignorance of the manager.  06/26/15. 9:30 pm.  Should be zero stars cause its simple to treat people kindly.  They failed again............sad cause it seems they fail a lot at this location.........just go someplace else......not worth having to teach the manager how to do math......"}
{"text":"I've been sitting here for almost 15 minutes now in the drive thru, there was only two cars in front of me when I got here. This new night crew needs to be fired and they need to hire the old night crew back because these people are slow as hell!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Carl's ever!!!! Drive thru takes at least 30 min if your the only car. I've never received the correct order. About 6 visits."}
{"text":"Bad service .. Short staffed on a Saturday , 15 minutes waiting for someone to ask me if I needed help .. Summer time ac is off !! Just bad overall !!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Hardee's whenever I travel to the Southeast, so I was excited to try their West Coast sibling: Carl's Jr. This particular location was in a bit of a rougher neighborhood so there was a homeless person/hobo who was inside, but they didn't bother anyone. The burger was super beefy and excellent, as I've come to expect from this chain, and the fries were fresh, crispy, and delicious."}
{"text":"This service was fast and the employees were polite, but the presentation of food was pretty awful. My burger was just a lose pile of sloppy meat, sauce, and buns. It didn't even look remotely like it does in the picture. I know it's never the same as in the TV commercials but it just looked like whoever made it absolutely did not give a damn. Not the first or last time either, I've had this experience more than once here, and even at other Carl's jr. locations in Vegas. I used to eat at a Hardee's in the Midwest and that was my favorite fast food restaurant, but after moving out here and trying the west coast version of the same fast food chain, I'm kinda disappointed."}
{"text":"Hi welcom to Carl's Jr. and green burrito. WE DONT HAVE ANY FOOD LEFT. Wtf stock your trucks so you don't tell me your out of fries or everything on the green burrito menu!!"}
{"text":"Eat at this place daily so I finally decided to post food is always fresh and never wrong prices are a littel high but face it when your hungry it's the way it goes price you don't even  look at the manager who has took my order several times is a nice person just putting that out there"}
{"text":"Came to this location twice and both times the service was so slow. The first time we ordered twenty minutes past and we still hadn't gotten our order and when we asked, the lady said they hadn't even started on our order the place wasn't even busy. The second time the guy in the drive thru got our order wrong this was the worst Carls jr ive been to"}
{"text":"If I could give a 0 I would. I went there today and messed up my order. Okay, no big deal right? The problem was that I was the only customer at the store. After fixing my order, I finally got to enjoy my meal. Well, the bread was hard as a rock and I could not physically bite through the bacon. Horrible place!"}
{"text":"i don't know where to start.  Hands down the weirdest food visit ever in my life.  I swear the whole time I was there I was in the twilight zone. The date was Friday June 19, 2015.  My buddy and i walk in to nice a/c as it was well over 115 degrees that day.  It looks as if by different color uniforms and demeanor of the workers , the managers were up front with staff and what looked like higher ups in different colors. One lady said \"how can i help you\" nicely, and when i tried to order she said to wait ,  walked back and forth, looked at the register for what felt like a minute than said ill get someone to help you.... ok...  so than an older male kinda looking like a variation of Walter White greets me with a handshake.   Not a regular hand shake.   he shakes sternly than pulls my hand towards him over the counter and keeps holding my hand for about 20 seconds giving me the creepiest smile.  I'm a bit taken by this aggressive handshake, pull my hand away and try to place my order.  The man that tells me he will get another employee to take my order.....  ok?????   Now there are about 6-7 people in the front side, staff, managers, higher ups it seems. Now a new lady takes my order,  I correcting her on my order multiple times, when all ordered was spicy chicken no mayo, big hamburger, large drink.   hehe...   As this is going on Mr. handshake paces back and forth many times during my order, talks to the drive thru but no service, randomly doing all kinds of weird things, even opening the menu windows to look at the lightbulbs all while I'm ordering. The rest of the staff also doing these weird things that make no sense to me at all.  Thankfully,  over with ordering 15 minutes later!! , i go sit down away from the counter.   While waiting for the food, staff keeps going back and forth to what seems like nothing in the dining room.  Mr. handshake later brings me my food and this time puts his hand on my shoulder for an extended time rubbing for some reason.  I was taken aback for sure.  Thankfully he leaves and i can eat my meal with my buddy in peace.  While eating i over hear what seems like higher ups and managers talking about what they can fix.   One being not washing their hands along with quite a few other needed improvements.  I leave feeling like.....wtf....  as does my buddy.   It felt as if all employees were very under the influence of something crazy.  Not one , but all of the ones up front. I just don't know what to say.....    (shakes head)"}
{"text":"Love this carls jr location the food is always fresh and they always get my orders right cant really say anything wrong about this carls jr location."}
{"text":"This place is a disaster I stop here on my lunch break and today was the end of the line for me my drive thru order was not even complete missing food and the customer service is not professional the workers seem mad add the time with attitudes and drinking and eating all the time the presentation of the food is so poor Carl's is losing there standards honestly the food looks like a Picasso painting I'm so disapointed"}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch the other day and ordered a western bacon cheeseburger, jalapeno thick burger and some crisscut fries. It took almost 20 minutes to get my food and then when I got it home there was only 1 jalapeno on my burger! WTF? It was like a dry basic burger. I had to add my own condiments at home just to eat it.  Then I get to the western bacon cheeseburger and it has a pile of minced, fatty bacon in it. It seriously looked like someone already chewed it up and spi tit back out on the burger and I could't even eat it or feel comfortable feeding it to my dog. You know it's bad when it's not good enough for your dog. The crisscut fries I mean what happened to them? They had a wannabe curly fry taste and a majority of the fries were not even crisscut shaped. Not worth the money and not like the Carl's I ate growing up in Cali."}
{"text":"This place is garbage the black dude with the nappy nasty ass hair and a dew rag half assed on has the worst customer service. He won't greet you or say your welcome and seemed so annoyed when you would ask for extra condiments. He was working the drive thru speaker 6/10/16 1:00 am idk his name he wasn't wearing a name tag but hopefully management will know who I am talking about according the time mentioned."}
{"text":"\"Fast food\" I say NOT. Slowest service I have ever seen. And no coffee at 10am. Had to wait so they could make it."}
{"text":"OK. This area used to be shady. But they've renovated it since then. Clean and service is okay. Not that \"fast\" to be considered fast food.   Ehhh. Go someplace else. There's another Carl's Jr on Rainbow and Trop."}
{"text":"Went through the drive-thru here on Sunday, 7/24, at about 10:30pm, and the kid at the window was miserable from his introduction on the speaker. We thought we'd give him the benefit of the doubt in thinking that perhaps he had a bad day, but then we watched from the payment window, as he rolled his eyes, made faces, and jabbed at the computer screen in total disgust at the following car's ordering or conversation over his headphones. I have never seen such immaturity in a person while at work. We just watched in disbelief, but didn't say anything to him because he was handling our food. Speaking of our food, fries were cold and the burger had much too much sauce on it. We were awed by the entire experience. We won't be going back to this location again - and that kid needs to get fired. He's unstable."}
{"text":"I don't review every fast food restaurant I visit, I swear. But this particular Carl's Junior is just *sigh* worth writing about. I've been here probably 10 times over the past year and if they were to ever mess up my order in the future, I wouldn't even be mad at them because they've been so awesome thus far.  First of all, the older gentleman who works (or used to work) the drive thru window late at night-- I love him. He's not super friendly or talkative or anything, but he can make a damn good sandwich/burger. I have a bit of OCD when it comes to things like tomato slices and cheese and lettuce on burgers (don't judge me); I insist on having them perfectly centered (is this something I should discuss with a therapist?) and this man always pulls through. He must be the best burger-builder in Las Vegas. Plus he's fast and never creepy. You order your food, you pay him, he hands you your food and your business is done. No weird small-talk at 11 o'clock on a Tuesday night. YES!! And the food always looks like he took his time, but he's so fast. HOW DOES HE DO IT?! I don't know but I love him!!   Secondly, I had my first ever Carl's Junior breakfast sandwich from this location and it was amazing. I even tweeted that morning that Carl's Junior makes a damn good breakfast sandwich, if that proves how much I loved that sandwich. Then like a week later, I was out and about at like 8 in the morning and I was passing a DIFFERENT Carl's Junior location and I was like, \"They make a good breakfast sandwich. I have to get one.\" And was it the same as that sandwich I got at 3185 W. Ann Road? Hell no. It was awful. I didn't even finish the damn thing. Turns out Carl's Junior does NOT make a good breakfast sandwich. Apparently quality is location-specific.  And finally, the food at this particular Carl's Junior is always piping hot. That's another one of those fast-food things that catches my attention. I don't like my food room temperature (unless it's like, potato chips or something). I like my hot food to be hot, and my cold food to be cold. I don't order anything from here that should come cold so I can say that 100% of the time, the food I've gotten from this place has been piping hot. *sigh*  So anyway, that's really all I have to say about this Carl's Junior. This location serves food the way Carl probably intended when he sold this franchise."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant. Great pleasant customer service, which makes all the difference. Thanks Jasmine & Brandon!!!"}
{"text":"I never write bad reviews but this location is horrible. I placed my order and waited 10 minutes and watched 2 people that ordered after me get their food before me. I thought this was fast food. I just got a refund and left. It wasn't even that busy."}
{"text":"Second best Carl's Jr. in Las Vegas! Food is always fresh and hot and service is very good."}
{"text":"From 4/7/15 I finally got a chance to try Carl's Jr since we don't have them where I lived in NY. I got the Guacamole Bacon Burger, which is made from 100% Black Angus beef. Let me just say,  that burger was jumbo sized and delicious- I could barely finish mine. I didn't even trust my fries. I am a fan, next time I will have to try their zucchini fries."}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr location can be found near the southeast corner of Decatur and Spring Mountain Rd., just in front of the SF Supermarket. I shop at SF typically every week and while the parents are shopping, sometimes we will pop in here and grab a quick bite to eat.  (+) The service is always very good when we come in here. We are always in here around 11am-12 noon-ish on Mondays and the same lady always seems to help us and bring us our food and she is always very friendly and kind. I appreciate her good customer service.  (+) I always look for whatever promos or specials are going on at the time.  You can get some decent deals that way. The regular menu items seem a bit pricey for what it is to me. (+) Not just a cookie cutter Carl's Jr, this place has a Vegas theme to it. It is kitschy and fun...for  fast food spot. (+) I actually enjoy their burgers and their chicken club sandwich.  (-) Never totally messy, but always looks like it could use a bit of a cleaning. Maybe this is due to the fact that it is an older building.  I don't know. It is what it is. It's a typical fast food joint. Honestly, I was going to give it 2 stars, but I bumped it up to 3 just because of the great service from that sweet lady who works there on Mondays.  3 stars.  It's A-Ok."}
{"text":"WOW, I'm impressed!  I may just choose to come here instead of In and Out because it was just as good as their protein style with the added benefit of NO antibiotics, steroids and hormones! The only thing stopping me from giving fifth star is that the burger could have been hotter in temperature.  The cashier happily brought the tray to my table because the place was empty.  It is very clean, even the restroom!  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went through drivethru and was given the wrong food. Went back to exchange and the staff thought it was funny, then refilled my drink with the wrong thing.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"Just a quick note to say how nice they are here at the drive threw my coworker who will remain nameless...gave me a gift card for Carl's jr says he's buying me the ladies of the office lunch and low and behold there was 1.00 on the gift card @$#& #&$ @$#&!! Since I didn't bring my wallet I was sooo embarrassed the drive thru guy was soooo nice and made my order fresh when I came back with actual  money.  Great service!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of my least favorite locations on the southwest side of town. The customer service is generally okay but can be a hit or miss! The turn over rate here is incredibly high and I'm not sure if that's due to management issues or not but the fact is whether it's fast good or not this is Carls Jr.. For the prices that they charge for a full meal on one of their premium burgers you better be delivering smash burger or five guys type of service.. I have been missing in action from Carls Jr for a while and yesterday decided to give this new Texas BBQ sandwich a try since I had one of those local coupons to by a meal and get another sand which free.. :-/ Whoomp whoomp $10 plus later I get home to this DRY burger! Nothing like the burger on the commercial but let's be real when do these burgers ever come out like the commercials lol.. Yeah I was livid to say the least! Should've went to SMASH BURGER like I was going to.."}
{"text":"This Carl's Jr. Location you can find located right on the cross streets of Spring Mountain & Decatur. So listen.. Meal deal coupons are the only way you can usually get me to any fast food restaurant and specifically only for breakfast! Carl's Jr. has always been one of the more expensive ones in the fast food league because apparently the burgers are better...   Recently they had a deal on one of the breakfast biscuits and my co-worker suggested we go one day. When we arrived through the drive thru we were greeted by somebody who barely spoke English who ended up getting our order incorrect.. Patience is suppose to be a virtue and lord knows on this morning I had plenty of patience.   Finally I asked for the manager who came over and explained that this person was new and didn't know how to process coupons and apparently they didn't know how to take drive thru orders either but I shall digress... We all have to start somewhere right? The good news is that the Monster Biscuits were good!"}
{"text":"Thank you ;) fast fun clean.  I have never had a problem and if I do I know they would have no problem fixing it. When you have down time they are always cleaning so that makes me feel good about the sanitary condition of the restaurant. Brings my food straight to my table does not yell out a number and expects you to run over before they throw it back. Good place."}
{"text":"The best customer service from a fast food chain,  EVER! The location is clean,  staff is respectful,  helpful,  and quick!  And did I mention the food quality?  I've been to this chain in four different states,  this single location does it perfect. Fries are crispy, burgers have a perfect char, condiments and drink station is clean and full. We live closer to other locations,  but the quality and service will keep us coming back to this location again and again.  It's well worth the extra mileage!"}
{"text":"My food came out cold and dry, cheese wasn't even melted nothing. Frys not fully cook. I'm not mad how much everything came out, but. How badly the food was serve. So sad"}
{"text":"The chicken tenders are so good it makes want to slap yo mama and the Mike shake is good too ."}
{"text":"Angel should be commended! Never seen him in a bad mood or ever flustered.  Carl's Jr. should be proud to have such a great employee."}
{"text":"I have never had such terrible customer service before. Sit tight people, this is gonna be a long one...  So basically at around 1am my boyfriend & I ordered food before we were headed to someone's house. I asked for a grilled Club sandwich, fresh, and my boyfriend got a bacon western something or other, fresh as well. We ordered some fries & other things but what we wanted fresh were the sandwiches and the fries. It's 1am, I don't want what could be sitting in your trays for the last hour, you know? They said they would give it fresh, but I waited LESS than 3 minutes and they brought the food out to our window. Maybe they were already cooking to make fresh ones prior to me asking,  idk, but the wait was short, and I didn't think anything of it.   When we arrived at my cousin's house we pulled out our food. Fries were fresh, check. I unwrapped my sandwich and 1) it was SO sloppily made 2) it lacked vibrant colors, like the it looked as if everything were OLD and STALE, 3) there looked like BBQ sauce on my club sandwich, and 4) MY GRILLED CHICKEN WAS BURNED!!!!! I decided to take two bites and taste it. Yep, burned. I complained to my boyfriend and he said his smelled burned but he didn't see where. He isn't the type of person to complain about any food, he doesn't like to be an inconvenience, so he continued to eat.   He got to the bottom of his sandwich and was disgusted. He showed me what was wrong, the bottom of his sandwich, the meat was CHARRED. Like it was BURNED TO A CRISP. There were black bits/crumbs of the charred meat on the wrapper. He stopped eating his sandwich and finally decided I could call to make a complaint because this was too much.  I called to complain, someone picked up the phone and I relayed to them what happened. They said ok and handed the phone over to another person, based on the voice, it was the same person who took our order, and I had to repeat what was wrong and WHAT THEY TOLD ME WAS, \"I made the food fresh, right when you asked for it. I would never give out burned food.\" Which made me so mad because you automatically shut me, the customer, down, AND I'M THE ONE HOLDING THE FOOD RIGHT NOW!   They offered us to come back. That was it. They said, \"Well you could come back...\" So my boyfriend and I drove back, out sandwiches were wrapped up to return and when he handed our burgers to the manager, they looked oddly familiar to me, and they said my name, and then, said, \"You bitch!\" I don't care if I know you or not or how long it's been since I saw you (I haven't seen this person for YEARS), right now, my food is messed up, I felt like I was being accused of lying, and I was pissed.  That person then said, \"So you ate half your guys' sandwich and you want a replacement?\" In such in accusatory tone it pissed me off because THEY NEVER EVEN OPENED THE SANDWICHES TO LOOK AT THEM ! Then they wouldn't give part of the money back for one of the sandwiches because they went to remake it and we didn't want it remade. They remade it anyway. And the same person LITERALLY told me, \"Next time check your food before you leave and don't call just to say shit\" EXCUSE ME. That was totally out of line and disrespectful and I feel like just because, once upon a time, you knew me, doesn't give you the right to get comfortable enough to talk to me like that. I knew this person for a few months because we worked together when I was 16. I am now 22 and I haven't seen them or heard from them since. So no. We aren't friends. I am a customer. And you disrespected me, my boyfriend, you messed up my food AND had the nerve to accuse us of lying/trying to get more food. Forget this place. Never again."}
{"text":"Place is a joke... slow drive thru... I'm the only one here and it took 20 min for a chicken sandwich.  Poor service"}
{"text":"I don't understand how the same product can vary in taste from location to location... and yet it does.  Unfortunately for this Carl's Jr... it was not for the better.   I ordered the #4  $5 Meal Deal as usual at this chain and was expecting the same great food that I get from the Centennial and Losee location.  The food was hot and the fries were hot and fresh... that was the good.  The bad was the chicken sandwich was really REALLY dry and hard to eat and the burger was extremely bland.  The use of mayo must be a foreign concept to them for the chicken sandwich as was ketchup and mustard for the burger.    The cookie that came with the meal (usually hot with a little crisp on the edge and soft in the middle) was way harder than it should have been which leads me to believe it was a leftover from yesterday.  This is my favorite 4th time at this location and this locations 3rd strike.    The only reason it gets one star is because I haven't gotten sick.  Looks like I will have to get my Carl's fix elsewhere.    The Karcher's are rolling in their graves at what most of the franchises have become.  It's a damn shame."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this location tonight. I mentioned it was my birthday, when I got home I discovered a cheese cake...  I will definitely remember this lovely surprise! It's not my first time here, the employees are really nice and friendly. Great customer service. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I had bad service here at the drive thru late last night. The one who takes the order was rude. She sounded like she didnt like what she was doing. When we got our order, one of the burgers didnt have a beef patty! We returned and told them about it. The offered to replace the burger and refund the cost of it. I looked inside the store and I can see the one making the burger was on her cellphone, maybe thats why she missed putting the patty in my burger the first time.  Oh well, never again will I come back here."}
{"text":"The manger was complaining to the clerk while she was counting bills at order counter. They did not care of us who wanted them to take our order. Such a nice service."}
{"text":"Their breakfast biscuits are absolutely delicious and love them we love when we can go and get them! My order is always right and we receive polite service. The chicken can often be dry unfortunately. We are normally in and out of there very quickly."}
{"text":"Today I tried the Baby Back Rib Thickburger.  I was disappointed.  The burger was not freshly cooked.  It was really dry.  Also the images in the ads are no where near accurate.  In the ads the ribs look like it is an inch thick and cover the burger.  Instead you get two small pieces of meat about 1/4\" thick.  Look at this picture.  For $6.99 I expected more.  I'm also not impressed by the drink choices.  I'd like to see more variety."}
{"text":"Justin took our order, he was awesome,, suoer friendly!!! Way to go Justin,  you deserve EE of the month!!!!"}
{"text":"His place is all ways open it is all so kinda good ! The workers are helpful they know there menu and turkey burger is really good ! It a must in fast food"}
{"text":"For a fast food joint the customer service here rocks.  Got a to-go order and Maria was nice enough to give me a plastic bag so it was easier to carry.  Did she have to? No.  Could she have looked the other way when I had my hands full?  Probably.  Maria, and other Carl's Jr. workers here are making this my to go place for burgers for the service alone."}
{"text":"i didnt eat just got a happy meal for my son....of course he loved it....food was hot and fresh"}
{"text":"I seldom go to carl's jr or any fast food places in particular. But when I do, I go to this location. I like their fast service. Convenient location. The drive through window staff were efficient and courteous. They have the green burrito in this location, which is a plus."}
{"text":"Slowest service ever. Took forever to take my order and forever to get my order. It's not even rush hour. It was 2pm sunday. Thanks but not here again."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty and prices are reasonable.  The grilled cheese sandwich with sausage is really good."}
{"text":"Always dirty. Customer service is terrible. Cam in after work ordered 2 big cheeseburgers w lettuce onion and tomato added, i get home and they had NO meat so i called and told the manager who apologized and insisted she replace the mistake at my earliest convenience.  2 days later i show up with the receipt and am told by 2 teenage kids that im on the list but they looked over the video footage and determined they didnt make a mistake insinuating i lied.   Never giving this chain another dollar."}
{"text":"My LOADED BREAKFAST BURRITO was not good this morning who ever made it was in a rush and it didn't have everything that came inside. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"This place is awful Nothing is stocked. No lids. No ice. Unprofessional workers. Slow workers.  Ordered a chicken sandwich. Ended up opening my bag to a burger Then brought it back and the girl blamed the cook. Even though she grabbed the wrong item Then I got my chicken sandwich and bit into it and it was like a piece of rubber. Probably not fully cooked I go to get it swapped and they say the can't do anything I just said make a burger instead Then they agreed but I'd have to reach in the trash and get my sandwich I thru away At the end of it I grabbed it and they finally made me a burger Never again"}
{"text":"20 minutes and counting to get my food. Awesome service. And then they asked me what I ordered, even when theres only two other people besides me. This place sucks."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Workers are very rude and lack serious customer service skills. My drink just didnt taste right like the syrup was low on the machine. The woman at the window told me it was perfectly fine. Ok so I get home and something told me to look at my burger and low and behold my bread is moldy. And no it was not just burned bread! I threw it away and will never, ever, go back to this place. Thats what i get for wanting some fast food. BEWARE! These people are going to get someone sick and they are lucky I did not ingest any of this B*llsh*t! Fyi... Dont waste your money, time, or health here!!!! DO NOT EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"My review is going to be for the iced tea. I loved iced tea, and there are very few places (especially fast food places that make it right.)  Carl's Jr does the brewed iced tea well.    Simple; large iced tea with lemon.  Easy right?  Wrong!  The lemon must have been rotten, because when I got home, I had to throw the almost $2.00 drink in the garbage, because it was so sour and bitter.   Thanks!  Forget the health issues and leave lemon for days, because it is to mundane to cut and serve."}
{"text":"100% natural mushroom swiss burger. I didn't give 1 star cuz bun was good and cheese and burger were pretty good, mushrooms disgusting, fries disgusting, drink not so good, price really bad like 10.00$ not worth at all.  Update I changed to 1 star cuz overall pretty bad"}
{"text":"Great experience! I called to make a large order,40 double sliders and they knocked it out right away.  When I arrived everyone was kind and helpful!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"The chicken tenders had a weird rubbery texture and this was the second time so no more for me."}
{"text":"Love this Carl's Jr. I've been going to this one for 4 years now and have never had an issue with the staff. There was one time my order got a little messed up. 1 time in 4 years. That's pretty good. The staff is always professional and very nice. The food is always fresh and quick and of course very good."}
{"text":"Total trash. They over charged for several dollars. The manager comes out with attitude for me because his cashier short changed me like 3 dollars plus. The manager took my receipt and then throws 2 dollars at me. I never go back here. Trash"}
{"text":"This store has Coke Zero in their fountain offerings!"}
{"text":"I go to Carl's regularly back in San Diego and so when I travel I try to go places I usually dont, but this morning I NEEDED food ASAP and reluctantly went this Carl's... and I am THANKFUL I Did! I went with the Jalapeno 1/3 Thickburger... Burger was cooked Perfectly, just enough sauce, the lettuce... OMG the lettuce was AMAZING! So Crisp, each bite was crisp and cool, the Tomatoes were so ripe and juicy, the Red onion was so fresh and crisp as well, the bun was perfectly toasted... Seriously the BEST Fast Food Burger I have ever had in terms on quality and the taste was Amazing as well. The staff was super nice and respectful as well... next time I am in Vegas and in need of a quick bite, I will be back at this location for sure! Well done Carl... Well done."}
{"text":"First time hearing about this place. The food was decent & affordable the service was prompt & thorough. And I must say the biscuits were the fluffiest ones I've ever tasted. Definitely one of the best fast food places I've been too."}
{"text":"I just trying to get something to eat for my tea time. I like the services that one guy at the front counter and he also take care of drive thru customers also. Whew he finish the line, he would also check with the customer who are eating, make sure they are happy for all request. Very nice job!"}
{"text":"This place is the slowest. Went to the drive thru and sat there for 12 mins.  A lot of times they even get your order wrong at the drive thru.  I swear the people that works there are not efficient nor too bright.  Never go to the drive thru"}
{"text":"So I came here for breakfast in the drive through and literally got stuck in there for 25 mins and got late for work. Don't go to this one if you care about time."}
{"text":"Everything was super delicious and the quality of food was really good for a fast food joint! The oreo milkshakes are to die for."}
{"text":"There are a lot of problems at this location.  Very unprofessional and the manager needs to be fired for his actions.  I did benifit out of this situation but this was by far the most ridiculous visit ever.  I will not be returning and I would recommend you visit another chain of restaurant."}
{"text":"Meant to leave this review a few weeks ago when I came through here in the drive thru.  The food was alright, but was really pleased with the guy in the drivethru - I hadn't been to a Carl's Jr. before only Hardee's, and needed to kinda gander at the menu for what I felt was a longer time than usual.  Homie was very patient and friendly and I really appreciated his customer service, sorry I didn't get his name.  Thanks for dinner!"}
{"text":"The food looks great in the photos and then you get something that might possibly resemble it in wrapping paper.  Really gotta stop coming to this chain. It gets no better with different help or management. Today we tried the teriyaki burger. Slice of pineapple was half the size of the burger. Fries were half done and half a order had to send them back."}
{"text":"Went thru the drive thru today. My bad I can't remember her name but the lady was pleasant and I could understand her. She even talked to my granson. She made sure we had forks @ knives for our salad. The area here @ Spring Mountain & Decatur is a mess. Be careful making your way into the shopping center."}
{"text":"Bryan was the one taking our order, very soft spoken, very polite, handled the noon time rush very patiently. Food was freshly made & hot. Small shift of members for a saturday. Rose was runnin around crazy but did it with a smile & offered any help to the customers. Very nice staff."}
{"text":"I've previously avoided this location because I don't love the shopping center they ate in. but I changed my tune after my first visit. Jamine was so genuinely helpful and had pride in her work. the food was delicious   I love the zucchini. I will definitely go back again and will tell my friends how good the service is there."}
{"text":"Their teriyaki burger is the best! They are even better than any hawaiian bbq place I've been to in the valley and that's kind of sad because their's is the closest to an actual teriyaki burger from the islands. I always order it minus the fancy smancy pineapple and onion. Blah. Fruit should not be on an type of food except dessert dishes. Drive thru workers are very friendly and cheerful which is nice to see especially during the lunch rush."}
