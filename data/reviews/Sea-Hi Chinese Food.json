{"text":"We must have driven past this restaurant a thousand times, but never once considered it, despite the constant presence of customers in it.  The outside of the place is not entirely their fault... its an old building, and the parking spots (which are actually quite convenient) block the view.  But the inside is clean, and set up like a traditional Chinese family restaurant.  And its always a good sign to see the staff/family eating at their own place!

Our waitress was extremely nice and coherent, knew every item like the back of her hand, and made some good suggestions.  The Cantonese noodles were cooked perfectly to our rather specific instructions, and were exactly what was asked for.  My General Tso chicken was, I have to admit, as good as or better than most higher-priced Chinese restaurants in North York.  I was extremely impressed by the food, and for the price range ($9 per entre), it far exceeded value in my opinion. 

Simple setup, simple drinks, simple menu.  But great quality.  Nice and clean facilities, too.

So.... next time you see the sporadically glowing red neon of the \"Famous\" Sea-Hi Restaurant, why not give it a shot for lunch?"}
{"text":"They receive many customers. However, as a Chinese person myself, Sea-Hi's food isn't very good. It tastes less authentic and more western-styled. Service is bad (for takeout), and the people aren't very nice. I'm sure dine-in is probably nicer, but their food is of lower quality (probably why it is so cheap). I would not recommend going, unless you are absolutely craving Chinese food and have no other option."}
{"text":"I gave it 1 star as a joke, but honestly, this is hands down one of the worst Chinese or ethnic food places that I have ever experienced.  If that wasn't bad enough, I decided to give it another chance.  It was just as horrible.  Rotting vegetables.  Tasteless everything.  I wish I could say something positive except, please save your money.  I'm being absolutely honest.  By the way, I live nearly next door to it.  It's sad, really.  For me."}
{"text":"I am not at all a fan of delivering one star reviews. I'm sure Sea-Hi's proprietors are very nice people and have clientele that would whole-heartedly disagree with me.

But I feel a certain dedication to other Yelpers to steer clear of restaurants where I've experienced dining that left me feeling quite literally ill.

My friend and I both ordered from their lunch special menu. I opted for the Fryer Special.

It truly was just that, as 4 of 5 items on the plate were deep fried. Now I would never complain about that ratio... but here's the kicker(s):

The breaded strips of chicken had a very odd, smoky flavour which after a hesitant second bite, revealed itself to be a strip of bacon wrapped around the chicken (um, Jewish neighbourhood and no mention of it on the menu), the two chicken wings had a distinctive metallic flavour, the pork ribs were terribly chewy and dry, the shrimp had a mealy, thick dough around them that wasn't even fully cooked through and had a terrible, raw-fish smell and taste that lingered in my mouth for an hour afterward and the chicken balls were ok.

I guess it serves me right for ordering the Fryer Special.

Sea-hi... Seeya-bye!"}
{"text":"Disappointing at best... try Cynthia's or General Tso's Kitchen instead.

Bests: Vancouver Ribs were pretty good

Worst: Truly terrible \"bbq pork ends\" were not as one would imagine (ie - chewy sweet sticky end cuts of bbq pork) but rather just diced cubes of pale, tasteless white pork, and most other dishes were also flavorless and disappointing, including the chicken-bacon sticks people rave about! 

Tried them twice now, to give the benefit of the doubt, but there will not be a 3rd time."}
{"text":"I came here the other night and had an okay experience. The waitress continued to bring us pitchers of water every time ours was getting low. 

With my two food allergies, I was limited to fried rice dishes. I ordered the fried rice with beef and I asked for extra vegetables but they forgot to put them in my dish. I was kind of disappointed because I don't really enjoy eating strictly carbs.

My friends enjoyed all of their glutenous dishes. They raved about the deep fried chicken and bacon wrap dish. It looked good but it definitely wasn't gluten free. 

Allover, I would give this restaurant 3 stars. The waitress didn't want to ask the chef what else I could eat but when I called I was told they had gluten free soya-sauce. The waitress was too scared to ask the chef and I was stuck with one dinner choice. 

I honestly would not return to this restaurant unless my friends book it for another Christmas Eve dinner next year. I was disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. A totally awesome option if you are craving the chinese delivery of your childhood.

Since China House closed at Bathurst and Eglinton, we've been on the market for that time-warp american-chinese food restaurant that would be both easy to get to, easy to get into, affordable, and totally dependable. We popped in for a lazy Saturday lunch this past weekend and this is it. Free parking out front. Tons of space. What more do you want?

We had the entire place to ourselves but at 2:30 PM this was not super surprising (this changed as we were leaving, some families came in with kids for early supper.) The service was no-nonsense and low-maintenance but completely efficient and the older woman who served us clearly knew the menu backwards and forwards and inside out.

Your table is immediately set with a bottomless dish of crispy noodles and plum sauce for dipping, which is good for mindless nibbling. I had the wonton soup which had a few nice hunks of pork in it - and then followed up with a beef lo-mein. My man had the General Tso's chicken which was the way better choice, absolutely GIANT hunks of chicken with totally predictable and totally tasty sauce and heaps of broccoli. Very satisfying. Total bill was about 20$."}
{"text":"Another blast from my childhood.  I grew up just down the street from this place and I have been there quite a few times.  One of the few restaurants at Bathurst and Wilson that has remained at its original location.
Can be busy, but usually is not.
Ribs are awesome, as is the lemon chicken.  
Service is always exceptional and the family who owns this restaurant eat there, which is always a good sign.
It is very clean inside and is set up like a traditional Chinese family restaurant.
We love it there and would recommend to anyone who enjoys Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food here is thoroughly mediocre... meaning it won't get you sick, and it tastes good, but there's absolutely nothing special about it.

The food served here is thoroughly Jewish/American-Chinese. The clientele is mostly white and Jewish and the restaurant serves the type of fried/sauced Americanized cuisine that caters to this demographic. If that's your thing, you'll love the food (as it's quite good, as far as this style of cuisine is concerned). If you're looking for more traditional Chinese cuisine, you're probably best served looking elsewhere.

If you go in with the right set of expectations, you should enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"This restaurant looks like its been around forever. In fact its byline is: \"Chop Suey Tavern
Famous for Chinese Food since 1955\"

That is a long time. It is well frequented at lunch when we were there. The decor is very dated, and the place a bit dirty and in desperate need of a makeover.

The food is 'old school' Chinese food, that is what passed for Chinese food in the old days. They have slightly updated the menu but the restaurant is still in a time-warp.

I had what they called a \"Yaka Mein with Chicken\" Soup. I had never seen that spelling, but its not about the grammar but about the taste. I was hot, large and OK.

Not much else need be said for the place but if you are in the mood for the old favorites this could be the place for you...Not fine dining, but food....."}
{"text":"Ambiance....no
Cleanliness....questionable
Mediocre Americanized Chinese food......check

This place is a large run down looking resto with a friendly Chinese staff. They are cheap but it shows in the quality of the food. Most things are served either fried or with some kind of sweet sticky sauce. If your looking for an unhealthy and American style Chinese food experience, this place is probably ok for that."}
{"text":"I don't think that this is the best Chinese restaurant in the world but there is something about their egg rolls and their wonton soup that I can't seem to find at any other reason. I will keep coming back, if only for those two items."}
{"text":"Their fried rice no longer has the Hakka-smokey taste.  Rice gets very hard the day after.

S&S ribs were hard and had the look of an old-marinated/preserved meat, if you remove the red sauce.

Un-healthy food just got un-healthier!
Yet, it does not taste OMG good anymore like how a Canadianized-Chinese Food used to be.
MSG-laden.
And God knows what else."}
{"text":"Bad disgusting food. We ordered a rice noodle, ended up getting vermicelli (that is all stick together like a giant ball) with 2/3 plate brocolli. The flavour was ok, bc there isnt any. The bbq pork in the dish is the worst bbq pork I've ever had in my whole life. They use the part of the pork that make soups. The bbq pork is tasteless and super dry.
I asked for a Chinese menu, they dont have one.
I ordered the most typical dish stir fry beef noodle (river noodle), they dont hv it.
They charged $2 for each can of drink.
We were the only 2 ppl in the rrstaurant. I wondered why!"}
{"text":"Ok this rating is based on one item and it was takeout. I bought their fried rice special. I was surprised because it tasted like hakka Chinese (did not expect that) BUT the sad part is that it was so bland. Like eve  the duck was really bland. Was really disappointed especially considering it was their specialty. I don't know, feeling hesitant to spend 10$ to try something else just to change the rating. For now I'll stick to the Chinese restaurants in China town"}
{"text":"I had my 1st birthday here and have been coming here ever sice!
Don't judge from the outside of the building.. 
Don't judge when you see the GIANT gold Buddah that is chipped and destroyed or the retro seating!

The food is EXCELLENT and the best in Toronto!
The owners have been working their since it opened and are always there to serve their customers!
The complementary crunchies and brown plum sauce is to die for! 

#1 things to try here:
- Brown sticky sauce ribs 
- Chicken Bacon Sticks
- Sea-Hi fried rice
- Crunchies & Brown Plum Sauce
..did i say Brown sticky sauce ribs? :) THEY ARE THE BEST THING ON EARTH!!!"}
