{"text":"Franchise location. Basically a pub with food. I have never been impressed by the food nor the service at this location. I would not recommend it to my friends, and after the last time I was there, I decided not to go back, not a great experience."}
{"text":"i've been here twice before. once should have been enough.

the first time- i was on lunch from work i get 30 mins. i asked if i could get a quick meal (the chicken caesar wrap) the server was polite and said no problem. how long could a wrap take right? 25 minutes later i'm freaking out cause i have 5 mins to get back to work and i still haven't eaten yet. i ask the server whats taking so long? she explains to me the the chicken is fresh and they cook everything from scratch. so i asked her why she didn't say anything when i initially asked for a quick meal. she shrugged her shoulders. i payed for my meal to speed up the process. and they brought me out my meal on a plate which had to be transferred to a takeout bag. i was 15 minutes late from my lunch break and heard it from my boss. i finally got to eat my lunch, hours later when i was on break...soggy caesar salad wrap

the second time- my husband and i went in and were seated quickly beside the bar. there were a few people scattered abouts enjoying themselves. the menu stated that the nachos were layered with cheesy goodness. i'm obsessed with nachos, i eat them at every restaurant just to see who has the best. the way the menu described the the nachos i was sold! my husband got his fav too- a burger. the wait wasn't that long and we were sharing a pitcher of beer when my food came out.  i received a pile of nacho chips with a pile of melted cheese in the middle. its $10 nachos its not rocket science. you just need to apply yourself. i sent it right back- your menu advertised layers of cheesy goodness!  the server offered to get the kitchen to remake my nachos but i didn't want them anymore and refused. i didn't realize that the owner was at the table next to ours. she had her smokes on the table along with her red wine. she got up and followed the server to the kitchen 7 feet away. she was so pissed that i sent it back. my husband and i were listening to her flip out about the waste of food and how much it costs her. it was kinda funny until we heard her say she was gonna talk to me and change my mind. she comes out all polite and smiles at us.  asking me why i don't want my order. i replied saying that if you cant get something as simple as nachos right the first time that kinda says something about your ethics. i asked her how she would advertise layered nachos and then literally just throw it all on a plate and heat it and serve? her tone changed with me and then tried telling me of other things on the menu (by this time my husbands burger had arrived) once the owner finally heard me she left for a smoke on the patio with a customer.  the burger was NO better!!!!    tiny burnt patty on a stale HARD bun!!  and from then out our server wouldn't even look at us and didn't come to remove empty pitcher or glasses or the half eaten burger plate. didn't come to offer us more drinks. nothing. we ended up putting our empty glasses and pitcher on the table next to ours, the one with the smokes and red wine.  after getting up and finding our server we paid and left never to return"}
{"text":"If Yoko Ono knew about this small chain of pubs, she would sue their pants off! The name is one thing, but the logo with the Pepper-era Lennon glasses and moustache is too much! Not to mention all the Beatles posters...

At any rate, we weren't expecting much from a chain pub next to a Wal-Mart up in Stouffville, but it was decent. My wife didn't like her fish all that much, but the wings were quite good. I had the sweet chilli, and the wings were big and the sauce was tasty. There is the usual mostly-domestic beer list for this type of chain. I had Mooosehead.

If you just want wings and pints, this is a decent option."}
{"text":"This review is mostly based on the service. 

My boyfriend and I walked in on a Saturday afternoon, around 1:30pm. There were maybe 2 tables that had 2-3 people, and the rest were all filthy, with empty glasses and dishes still on them. Almost every table was dirty. We waited close to 5 minutes at the door before we were greeted and seated, but we couldn't even sit right away because we had to wait for or server to clean the table. 
The owner/manager is rude. She came over to us to take our order. We requested an appetizer, and she jumped in with \"Oh no, don't get that. It's horrible.\" Not exactly a good way to run business, deterring people from your menu. So we changed our appetizer, ordered our mains, and off she went. 
When our food came, my wrap seemed a little greasy on the outside. My boyfriend's side order was wrong, and we waited 12 minutes for our bill, from the time we asked for it. 
Filthy place, and unless you live in a barn, I doubt anyone would like that."}
{"text":"Wings Good.  Nachos BAD I am mean REALLY bad.  Salad amazingly disappointing.  Atmosphere is terrible. The booths are dirty and jacked up so its like you are sitting on display.  Wait til you visit yourself....  If there aren't any other options I would suggest but that's about it"}
{"text":"Where do you go to catch the game in Stouffville? There don't appear to be many ready options in this WASP farming community that's slowly being transformed into a bedroom community for the Markham high tech edge city. 

Sgt Peppers provides a reasonably compelling option. All your favorites are here: fish 'n' chips, nachos, and wings. I'm not a fan of wings but my neighbor and her injured friend  were anxious to try some wings. We got the nachos and greek salad as well. The nachos were actually pretty dull and I could have made better nachos. The greek salad was okay. As non wing eater (meat to effort ratios just aren't there) I did enjoy these wings.

Beer was cheap. $3.50 for a tall boy. I stuck to the root beer as I drove. 

Service was really friendly.

Anyway, the Toronto hordes aren't going to flock out here but if you find yourself in Stouffville visiting an injured friend and you're looking for a pub 'n' grub place, Sgt Pepper's is quite serviceable and won't break your bank. 

Oh and I never made the connection between the pub's name and all the photos they had of The Beatles inside the restaurant. I'm just not a Beatles fan, really. Now if they had called this place Mos Eisley's and there were photos of Greedo and Ponda Baba, I might have got the connection."}
{"text":"We hesitated about coming here at first, but I am glad we did. When you enter  this place you feel like you are in a 70's style sports pub that has been retro fitted with a Beetles theme. 
The tables and booths have a warm rustic look though, but I would give the decor of this place 3 stars. But Yelp is about the food and this is where they get their 4 star rating from me.
My friend and I decided to share a couple of items and we ordered popcorn shrimp and a steak and rib combo. The steak was lean and flavorful and the ribs were amazing, they were lean and came off the bone effortlessly,  and were complimented by some perfectly mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables that were on a skewer. Our server was great,  and overall I found the place fairly clean. O.k the decor did not have the wow factor but the food definitely did.
If you are ever in this area, and have a craving for comfort foods, give this place a chance, we were pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times. The decor is like any other franchise type of restaurant. The difference in this location is the chef. He was very friendly and accommodating to our wishes.

 They don't just serve fries and wings. I have enjoyed many homemade soups, wild mushroom soup, potato leak soup and a bean soup. I had a steak melt sandwich and could only manage to eat half and take the other half home. They have a curry dish which is quite nice and you can choose the spice level you can handle.

During the night hours, I understand that they offer live entertainment from local bands and of course offer many large screen TV channels for sports fans. It is very clean and service is pretty good depending on how busy it is. 

I like the food here so I am giving it a four. 

If you are in the area, this is a great place to go to with another couple or a few buddies...."}
{"text":"2.5 Star

This review is based on drinks only as we didn't order food at Sgt Peppers.

Sgt Peppers feels like family owned as this place is really short of wait staff. Quite a few tables were not cleared when I dropped by around 10:30 pm in the evening to catch the last period of NHL game.

Beer on draft is decent and priced well. We ended up ordering Mill Street Organic Ale and Keith's Galaxy Hop. 

Staff starting to clean the tables around us using cleaner which I am really allergic to the smell.....

TVs though plenty were small and not high definition.. but at least I can watch the game no matter where I sit."}
