{"text":"I'm giving this place a 2 stars because of the fresh omelettes they serve. Other than that...service sucks! You will be waiting for a looooong time before they take your drink order....then another loooong time before they take your food order. If you order coffe...it will also be a loooong wait for a refill. Don't know if they are short staff or what it they need to fix it."}
{"text":"I came into Ollies this morning and ordered a custom made chorizo omelet. While eating the omelet, i noticed that there were several raw pieces on my plate. I brought this to the servers attention who immediately took my plate to go show her boss. When she came back she said it was pieces of \"tendon\". It was very obvious that it was raw meat. Not only did the manager not come to our table to explain and apologize, but she refused to take it off the bill. I will be filing a formal complaint with the health department and will not be going back to Ollies ever again.  Do Not Eat Here!"}
{"text":"Ate here 2 times for breakfast.   Not sure why they have omelette in the name?   The omelette I had was overcooked and rubbery.   It was as though they pre-made them and tried to microwave them before serving (you know, when it's SO HOT in the middle of the omelette? You can't help but suspect microwaving).     No.  Stop now.  Turn around, go hit McDonalds if you have to - just don't go here!  EDIT 7/15/16:  This place is no longer in business (gee wonder why?)."}
{"text":"The California omelette was huge, very filling. The hashbrowns were krispy and not smothered with butter.  Food took a little long to come out, but was definitely worth the wait. This is so close to us that we will be revisiting often."}
