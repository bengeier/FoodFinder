{"text":"I wish that I could take all the stars ever given to this restaurant away. We just spent 2 hours waiting for our food only to have our server say that they lost our order. 2 HOURS! Drew came out and wished that he could make it better, but had no solution. I will try it again if they decide to actually bring me my food this time."}
{"text":"Highly recommend checking out this quaint little spot. Great selection of Scratch Made BBQ.  If your also a bourbon Fan, this place should be on your list too. Beer selection is great for the size of establishment. I'll be a returning customer!"}
{"text":"Holy *insert your favorite expletive here*!  I like good food and I love an establishment that cares about what they serve. The Rib Cage more than delivered both. We were served enthusiastically by the General Manager. That man makes one mean Old Fashioned, let me tell you. They have a nice selection of good micro brews and small batch bourbon, but let's get to the really good stuff - the food.

The meat. Good God, the meat.  Slow smoked - man, does that smoke make sweet, sweet love to all that delectable meat. They offer ribs, pulled pork, brisket, turkey and chicken so there's a meat for all occasions.  They have a few sauces but I don't think I'll make it past their Carolina sauce. Their baked beans were flavorful and the beans were the right consistency.  The cole slaw was creamy without being gloopy. Thats a technical term for \"swimming in mayo\".  Dessert - since I was already mere moments away from being the gluttony victim from Seven, what thr heck - let usmeat cake! They have a local baker who makes 3 signature desserts. We opted for the red velvet cake with white chocolate icing. Loved the icing, liked the cake though it could have been a bit more moist.

Go, go, a thousand times go to The Rib Cage.  Im so happy about having another good eatery in the Heights!"}
{"text":"I had the wings stupid fries with brisket. The food and hospitality was on point. The wings were especially delicious, and I consider them among the best wings I've ever had. The brisket fries had good flavor. The chef also showed me the impressive smoking system they have in the back. I appreciated that he was excited to share and talk about how they smoke every morning. I'd give it a five, but I've just had smoked meats from other BBQ joints around the us, and it didn't quite get to that level of some places in Austin and Kansas City, but I am sure they could. Every one that worked there were real friendly and made it a place you want it stay and hang out at."}
{"text":"Awesome little bar with great bbq. The brisket is served differently from how you might expect but it's still very good. And the sides were absolutely delicious. It's great having different sauces to choose from too."}
{"text":"Extremely nice owner and wait staff. Wednesday wing nights are an excellent deal. The herb buffalo sauce is the best buffalo sauce I have ever had. I would go back every week. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"The five stars is for the food because all we got was takeout. We got the turkey ribs with carolina mustard sauces, fried green tomatoes, baked beans, wings...all of it was delicious. Some of the best BBQ I've ever had. 

I don't think I'd ever eat inside though. This place is really just a dive bar that  happens to serve really great food. When I picked up the food the bartender was the only worker I saw, and he was swearing a lot while telling some story to two drunks at the bar. Not the type of place I would bring a date or anything. But really good food."}
{"text":"Love this place! Actually ate their food two days in a row because I couldn't get enough! The chili is amazing, loaded with sour cream, cheese and onions. The corn bread is probably the best corn bread I've ever had. I had the fried green tomatoes and they had great flavor and seasoning. My boyfriend had the greens and herb buffalo wings and he also really enjoyed the food. This is my new go to place for quick delicious food. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem for sure, despite its unassuming facade. I've been here more than a handful of times and their barbecue never fails to disappoint. The brisket is always tender, the portions are gigantic, their sauces are delicious (and plentiful), and the fries are terrific. And I love the cornbread! The servers are also very friendly and knowledgeable about barbecue, and will answer any questions you have far better than a yelp review can. I think this place is a must-visit if you are in the area and not a vegetarian."}
{"text":"Really happy we found this place!  We've driven by countless times and honestly never knew it was there.  \"Bartender\" Steve welcomed us right away.  It's in quotes because based on his personality and attitude we felt he had to be a Manager if not the Owner (and if he's not, he definitely needs a raise!).  He took obvious pride in his job and made sure everyone in the place  was having a great time.  We heard him joke on the phone with people putting in takeout orders, and busting balls of guests who were regulars.

And now the food.  We're not BBQ snobs, but we know what tastes good. And everything we ordered did. We split an order of wings (with a great jerk seasoning) and a Combination platter.  We chose BBQ pork and ribs.  A nice serving of pork but would have liked another rib with the order.  The sides made it enough food for us both though.  The ribs were meaty and the mustard vinegar sauce (a Steve recommendation) was a great change from your standard BBQ sauce (and probably ruined me for any other BBQ place now.)

Great beer selection as well!

We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great service, great food, cold drinks. Nothing fancy, just good atmosphere you can actually have a conversation in."}
{"text":"Great service. Ask for Steve.
We had the beef brisket, Turkey ribs, and spare ribs. The collard greens and baked beans and cornbread were perfect. Only reason it isn't 5/5 was the Mac and cheese. I was here last year and they were good, but this time they weren't much better than what you'd find at the grocery store. Last time I also had the wings and Not So Philly Cheese Steak. Both great.

Other than the Mac and cheese, the food was phenomenal. I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I like the food here and I like that this place is just around the corner from my apartment. The only entree I've tried is the pulled pork sandwich, but it's very tasty. Last time we also had the \"stupid fries\" with pork and brisket. They were delicious though they completely ruined our appetite for our entrees. It also was kind of odd for us (even though we knew we'd ordered \"stupid fries\") to have the waiter deliver them and say, \"here are your stupid fries.\" (hey now, is that how you treat your customers?... oh wait.) It probably didn't help that he seemed to be the only waiter there on a fairly busy Friday night. He definitely seemed harried. We ordered salads with our entrees and he forgot them. It took a very long time to get our salads, which, after the \"stupid fries,\" were really all we wanted to eat. It became an annoying experience. The previous time I was here, we had no problems with the service, so I'm hoping that this was an off night. 
I'd recommend this as an option on Lee Rd, and I'm sure I'll be happy to return."}
{"text":"This was THE worst rib dinner we've ever had... Portions were a total ripoff, ribs were tough and swimming in something that looked more like gravy than bbq sauce.. Beef brisket portion was a strip of gristle and a portion of beef that looked liked a folded steakum.... For 40 dollars we got 10 bucks worth of crappy food.. This is NOT a restaurant btw...it's a bar that sells ribs..next time I'll hit one of the 3 established rib,joints I passed on the way to this place...just awful..only redeeming quality was the baked beans...rest was terrible."}
{"text":"Omg. Amazing wigs and BBQ. This was much needed in the area. The hospitality is like that of a backyard grill. They're family. The food is as if u were at home. I implore all to go and try them out."}
{"text":"How this place has remained open for Three-ish years is beyond me. Craving BBQ, which does not exist in CLE, we decided to give this place a chance (our first since our disappointing trial run when it opened its doors). I placed the order \"to go\". 

I won't make this a novel. 
-Sauce, the house mustard vinegar, was tasty. 
-My St. Louis ribs and pulled pork meats  had to have been in a steamer for hours. Brown and tasteless. 
-The Cheese Mac, barely fair. Someone tell the chef we eat with our eyes first. Globs of Goo are not appetizing. 
-Slaw, smelled terrible, not fresh. Did not try. 
-Cornbread, fine.  Hard to screw corn bread up. 
-Fries, fine. Nice seasoning. 
-Bun for pulled pork looked like it would have been good,but sat in a quarter inch of sauce and only half of the top bun was recognizable. 

Why two-stars. Bartender gets one, beans deserve one. 

Never again."}
{"text":"I've only gone a few times for the Tuesday $2 taco night (which I'm not sure if they still do). I thought the food was pretty good. Haven't had anything but the tacos, but my other friends say the rest of the menu is decent.  the atmosphere was right on for the concept and the wait staff was funny... the bar tender kept ripping on my drunk friend... even gave her last beer of the night in a brown paper bag."}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas (home of the best beef BBQ on the planet) and went to school in Virginia where I was introduced to genuine Carolina pork BBQ, and I've found nothing that rivals authentic southern BBQ - until now. I cannot rave enough about the quality of their BBQ. Slow cooked so it simply falls apart, and with a sampling of assorted BBQ sauces that enhance but don't overwhelm the meat. I always take my girlfriend so we can order both beef and pork and I can leave totally sated. The service has also been uniformly excellent and it's become a regular in our rotation."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Service was great and the BBQ was the best around. Sauce was on point too!"}
{"text":"For some people going out to eat means selecting the right tie or jewelry to match their attire but for me it means grabbing a favorite skully and a comfortable pair of jeans.The Rib Cage is my kind of place.It doesn't make any effort to be anything it isn't but makes every effort to be exactly what it is ,a rib joint.This isn't just any rib joint though and I knew that from the moment my food arrived.The bartender Steve did an excellent job and was very attentive to all of those killing their thirst with a cold one sitting at the bar.I ordered the pulled pork and enjoyed a cold Left Hand Milk Stout while I waited for my order to be prepared.My hunger was rewarded rather quickly after a badass plate of BBQ goodness arrived in about five minutes or so.The pulled pork sandwich was great with a Carolina BBQ sauce that had the right amount of zip to it ,coleslaw and fries.I also ordered a small portion of the 3 cheese Mac which I really enjoyed as well but the sandwich was definitely the item that stood out as would be expected.Quite honestly the sauce is one of the best I've ever had in a restaurant or someone's home or backyard BBQ.The only reason this spot doesn't get a full five stars is because they were out Red Stripe which was what I really wanted to accompany this meal.To sum this up I'd say that perhaps instead of rubbing elbows with Royalty at the trendiest spot next time you might just want to enjoy the chance to grab that comfortable sweatshirt you never wear out of the house with a comfortable pair of jeans and enjoy a beer and some awesome BBQ at a bar where you might just be sitting by the guy who put a new alternator in somebody's Honda Accord earlier that day.You might be surprised at how pleasantly rewarded you are for doing so."}
{"text":"The meat is top quality and typically delicious. The bar is well stocked and paired. Just about everything else is inconsistant. I ate there four times and, in total, felt that I overpaid just a few bucks for every meal. Some side dishes are spot on (the baked beans and mac 'n' cheese are well sized and executed), some have real quality control issues (an overwhelming amount of too-sweet fries, the greens should be drained, one burnt and flat piece of cornbread). The bourbon sweet potato pie was heavenly, the peach/berry cobbler was awful - sour and falling apart.

Atmosphere is nicely warm and dark at the bar or the tables. The staff is typically responsive and knowledgeable, but I had one time where the server didn't know much about the sauces and another where the manager covering the bar ignored me for five minutes while talking with a couple immediately to my right.

All in all, if they were a little more consistant, or if the prices were a couple of dollars cheaper across the board, I'd gladly recommend this place to everyone. As it stands, expect a pretty good experience, and hope you pick right on the sides, sauces, and desserts."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I've had in Cleveland by far.  Fried green tomatoes and beans were excellent."}
{"text":"Wow. My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place on Yelp while searching for some decent barbeque. 
The place itself is small, but you are immediately hit with wonderful smells of something amazing happening in the kitchen. We were super hungry, so we ordered wings to start- carolina mustard vinegar sauce- DELICIOUS. The sauce was soooo flavorful with just the right amount of kick.
For dinner, I got the \"Philly not-so-cheese steak\", made with beef brisket and it was incredible. Covered in melted cheese sauce and peppers. I also opted to try the greens rather than the fries it came with and I'm really glad I did. They were amazing as well. A little spicy but super flavorful. My boyfriend got the brisket with spicy barbeque sauce (which he said was also very good), and I tried his mac&cheese and it was delicious as well. Definitive gouda flavor....yummmm. We both ate so much we were uncomfortably full and still wanted to keep eating. Will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Just got back to our room from experiencing the best chicken wings I can remember having in a long time. We were lucky enough to happen upon the cage on wing night, so we got a 10 pc of the Carolina mustard vinegar & 10 pc of the teriyaki.  Both had a perfect combination of deliciously crispy and saucy. I had a \"Not So Philly\" sandwich that is on par with the better Philly's over had. My wife and friend each enjoyed their dishes as well, a pulled pork sandwich w/ Carolina mustard and baby backs w/spicy bbq sauce. The one flaw we experienced was willingly made right, which was that there seemed to be some variability in the spiciness of the sauce.  That caused my wife's initial choice spicier than she can do.  Overall, a great dining experience in a place where you can carry on conversation."}
{"text":"Really solid BBQ.  The place is small, nothing special about the interior.  Kind of an \"L\" shape with a long, narrow bar and then a small back room.  The backroom had zero character but the bar had cool music and a cool vibe.  

The food was wonderful.  We started with the onion rings, and then moved on to ribs and pulled pork.  All were great with the Carolina sauce.  The fries were nicely seasoned, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  And the slaw, simply the best I've had.  Ever.  Anywhere.  

We'll be back."}
{"text":"The Rib Cage has become our go-to for just about everything. Hungry? Rib Cage. Thirsty? Rib Cage. Miss fun bartender haggling? Rib Cage. Parents in town? Rib Cage. Dinner with friends? Rib Cage. 

It doesn't hurt that we're within a very short walking distance here, but the food and Steve, the bartender, are what really draw us in. I'm not the hugest meat eater. And by meat, I really just mean pig...I'll devour a steak or chicken, and I prefer my burgers bloody, but pig makes me nearly gag. I've been told I may suffer from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boar_taint.

Anyways, back on track, I can say that the food here is delicious, despite my aversion to pig. There are plenty of other just as delicious options. The shrimp appetizer is amazing--I got it with a side of mac and cheese once and it was a perfect amount of food and delicious. The Not-So-Philly Cheesesteak is my favorite for when I'm feeling a little indulgent (like artery clogging and food coma indulgent), though. I also got a salad once and found that the salads aren't pre-packaged iceburg and carrot shavings. They're loaded and satisfying, which was a pleasant surprise coming from a place that obviously specializes in meat.  

I can't really say much more other than advise you to be prepared for a saucy mess and some sass (in jest) from Steve!"}
{"text":"With the exception of 2 people sitting at the bar, we were the only ones there that were dining. Service was really slow as the server/bartender mostly hung around the bar. Most of the food was just burnt. Baby backs and spare ribs came to the table black. Even the beans had a bitter burnt taste to them and also were black but not to be confused with standard black beans. You can only eat so much food that is charred before you cant take it anymore. I dont understand the purpose of charring the ribs? The spares could have been tasty but no such luck for the baby backs. They were burnt on the outside and nearly room temperature on the inside. Server brought several different sauces and didnt bother to tell us which was which. Also the cornbread was cold, as in refrigerated cold. Couldnt be bothered to at least warm it in the microwave? Disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"Flavorful and delicious food?  Yes.  

Killer house-made sauces and a commitment to sourcing humanely raised meat products and locally grown veggies?  Yup.

A gracious host Andrew?  Oh yeah.

Authentic BBQ?  Eh, not quite.
************
This girl has earned her BBQ stripes over the years.  I have been to many well-known and lesser-known BBQ places in Texas, North Carolina, St. Louis...you know, the BBQ belts.  So you could say I know authentic BBQ.  The BBQ at Rib Cage is not like these places.  True blue BBQ to me is the pronounced smoke-ring meat that has been cooked low and slow and melts in your mouth.  The meats were disappointing.  The pulled pork was swimming in sauce and looked like a runny chili on the plate.  Where was the pile of meat that just came off the smoker?  I have never been a fan of brisket so I can say I did not care for it but that is nothing new.  The house made sauces are all delicious!  The Mac and cheese was very bland...No character and underseasoned.  The BBQ beans are SUBLIME.. Smoky, flavorful and bold.  And the cornbread?  YO!!!!!  Wow so, so good.  but perhaps the pinnacle of the evening was the peanut butter pie.  From now on, that slice of evil will be my go-to PMS binge.  Stupidly good.  And rich.  PB lovers you must try this.

While Rib Cage meats are a far cry from traditional BBQ you will find in the BBQ belt, there is no denying the food is very tasty.  And its dive bar experience adds to its character.  Great music."}
{"text":"This is by far the best bbq I have had in Cleveland. I debated giving this place a 5 instead of a 4, but there is one thing holding me back: the smell when you walk in. I understand this is a dive bar, but it does have a faint smell of urine. Maybe I was there on a bad day? The bartender is friendly and fun. The kitchen staff even came out to make sure we liked everything. After dining in once and not loving the ambiance or smell, we have opted to take out from now on. Food is amazing though!!!"}
{"text":"I use to love this place.  It was the perfect hole in the wall for adult beverages, food and socializing.  

Lately, they've been annoying me with the poor quality of food and particularly the poor quality of their takeout orders.  For example, tonight we ordered two polish boys, greens, Stupid Fry Brisket chili and grilled shrimp.

Well, the polish boys were 11 bucks EACH ice cold and left a lot to be desired.  They were over cooked as were the fries which were not seasoned at all.

The Stupid Fry Brisket was disgusting.  This dish consists of a slice or two of really distasteful beef brisket entwined in a heap of cold, over cooked fries soaking in a gross mess of sauce It was stupid and not worth 13 bucks AT ALL

They totally forgot to include my greens but charged me 4 bucks for them. 

The chili was tasty and at least hot.  Hot chili / cold over cooked fries.  I'm bummed.

This wasn't the first time they messed up my fries.  I was sitting at the bar once and they placed a plate of burnt fries in front of me.  The server was kind of funky about taking them back and would only 
replace half the order because I'd eaten almost half.  I only ate some of them because I was starving... He was petty!

Tonight's bill was 54 bucks.  I may not return after this.  I feel like if you charge as much as the Rib Cage does for food, at least perform quality control checks -especially on takeout orders.  Never close and staple shut a bag unless you are sure the contents are true to acceptable quality standards."}
{"text":"Decided to try The Rib Cage Smokehouse tonight for dinner.  Found the restaurant on Yelp while searching for barbecue restaurants.  I called in the order around 6pm and spoke to Anneliese.  She was very polite when she answered the phone and took my order.  Anneliese informed me that the order would be ready in 20 minutes and gave me the total. The order was promptly ready in 20 minutes.  

We ordered a combination platter with brisket and rib tips with fries and corn as a side.  The brisket was a little dry but the mustard vinegar sauce was good.  The rib tips were delicious.  The corn was not as appetizing.  It seemed to have a vinegar taste to it.   For a first time it wasn't a bad experience.  I would try the restaurant again."}
{"text":"Stopped in looking for a late night dinner. Only place with an open kitchen after 11a. 

Sat at bar. Think the bartender was a nephew of the owners. Orders wings and some onions rings. Didn't want to get a ton of ribs so late. The lady next to me at the bar got the cheesesteak and actually gave me a taste. It was huge. And delicious. Our wings were good too. 

Good service, good experience, good food, and good patrons. Definitely revisit this place."}
{"text":"I hate to be giving such a low rating because I love this place! The wings on Wednesdays are stellar! But tonight was the complete opposite! The waitress took our drink order and then forgot to give them to us, so they were taken off the bill. I ordered a Philly steak sandwich that was like warm and super hard to eat! It was drenched in a Luke warm, bland cream sauce that I had to add salt to. My friend got a cheeseburger and the cook forgot the cheese! We never saw the waitress after she dropped off the food, the bartender had to refill our drinks twice! She reappeared to give us the check that was it. Such a blah and disappointing experience!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food.  My friends and I tried the brisket, the philly steak, pulled pork and brisket sandwich.  Sides we tried are the BBQ beans, collard greens, Mac'N cheese, and corn on the cob.  Too bad they ran out of ribs.  Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place, so I was pretty surprised when I left disappointed. The drinks and bartender were good, but the food was definitely lacking. Maybe it was just an off day, but the brisket was so tough it was practically inedible and the pulled pork was tasteless. The sides were better though, with the cornbread and mac & cheese saving the experience for me."}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal! I ate till I was stuffed. Started with the meaty saucy wings, 7 were perfect for 2 of us. I had the St Louis ribs that were tender with a crisp sear on the outside 6 big bones with greens, real baked beans & corn bread. He had the 2 meat combo with a quarter dark chicken & 3 ribs which didn't seem like a good trade for 3 ribs & a few extra bucks. Good was excellent. Plenty of televisions, good music & clean but rustic. Holly was attentive. We'll be back.

My subsequent visits here have been disappointing. Sorry for my premature enthusiasm."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place. LOVE their food. Pulled pork sandwich has been my favorite. Tuesday is Taco night - $2 pulled pork tacos with coleslaw. YUM."}
{"text":"This place is so underrated for how delicious their food is! If you're on Lee Road and see Rib Cage, you have to stop in. It will be worth it. There is a small parking lot next to it, but if that is full, you can find street parking easily. They have wing Wednesdays where you can get discounted wings (they're good sized wings) - I usually get 10 and then split 5 into two different sauces. My favorite sauce so far is their Thai sweet chili. I highly recommend you try the herb buffalo though - very interesting and very tasty. If you opt to get a side to share, go for the large fries!! Their dry rub on it is absolutely addicting. If you opt for a side for yourself, get the mac n cheese. IF you want ranch or ketchup or other sauces on the side, you'll have to ask but they don't charge you for it. They give you an extra bowl for the bones and even some wet wipes to clean your hands after the damage has been done. 

Their service is quick and friendly. If you sit at the tables in the back, just make sure someone saw you sit down or else you might get looked over. I wouldn't come here if you have more than 7-8 people since it is a small place, but that shouldn't stop you from coming with a smaller group (or getting take out)! 

Giving Rib Cage 4 stars for now until I can try more of their wing sauces and more of their menu. I'm hopeful."}
{"text":"Been here once before and the food was good. This time we sat there for 15 minutes without being acknowledged, even for drinks. The bar and dining were not busy and the waitress entered the dining area several times. Not even a \"I'll be right there\". Very poor service."}
{"text":"Wandered around for an hour and a half hoping to find a place to eat and have a few drinks after a 6 hour drive past midnight. A few places were open, but looked really sketchy. We found The Rib Cage and yummmm! The bartender was very cheery and attentive and the bar was well stocked. We had fried green tomatoes, BBQ wings and their pulled pork sandwich, all of which were outstanding! An oasis of good food, good drinks, friendly service and great blues playing to round out the night."}
{"text":"One of my few five-star places. The service is friendly and the atmosphere laid back. No frills here, or contrived attempts to convey 'authenticity'. The food speaks for itself. 

I had the St Louis Style spare ribs with the Carolina Mustard Vinegar, as one should. The meat was perfectly cooked, and the sauce was out of this world. The seasoning is reason enough to come here, and is the best rib sauce I've had. 

As a nice bonus, the sides are excellent. The fries are nice and spicy and the bourbon beans are on a whole other level. Wow. 

My go-to BBQ place from now on."}
{"text":"We love this place. Here are some reasons why.

They smoke their meat out back if it's -10 or 100 degrees outside. 

Their St Louis style ribs are so excellent. We like the spicy BBQ or Carolina sauce to go with it.

I'm drooling right now thinking about the Mac and cheese. And greens. Their seasoned fries are addicting too.

Have you ever tried turkey ribs? They are battered, fried and so tender.

You will get a LOT of food.

A few things that weren't expected... The place is a dive but charming at the same time. Service is kind of slow at times too, so make sure you're in a mood to just hang around and chill. Also, I've had mixed experiences with the cornbread - sometimes it's a little dry. And finally, expect to pay quite a bit for a meal if you're going with the meat plates! About $20 per plate.

So happy this little place exists near our neighborhood - go check them out."}
{"text":"Wow very impressed with the concept of \"turkey ribs\", didn't even know it was possible, & even more impressed with how crispy & juicy they were off the bone! Especially good with the spicy BBQ sauce.   So now that I know \"turkey ribs\" is an actual food entity, & a delicious one at that, I'm even more confused why no one else does em?!  Seems perfect for next Thanksgiving :)  ....this place is a nice bar too! Brisket was good n juicy n tasty, but nuthin compares to Texas with it's brisket \"bark\" & \"smoke ring\", but this was nonetheless good.... But again still in awe of this turkey rib thing! Lol  (what next? A plate of fish ribs haha;)"}
{"text":"First off I am not really into southern style foods but after trying The Rib Cage I order carryout probably twice per week. Has all the foodie checkmarks; local, grass fed, home made, \"sourced humanely.\" They even know the first name and favorite color of the produce they use (jk). Read the other posts I agree with what has been said. One thing I would add that makes them truly unique in CLEVELAND is the hours - they serve food till 2:00 and the only other competitor for that quality is Night Town which is only 12:00."}
{"text":"Great bourbons at good prices. The food that comes with the bourbon is also really good. Delicious meaty goodness."}
{"text":"Really great barbecue and laid back feel. Good beers too and a very helpful bartender. It's easy to mix an match to try different sauces and meats."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! The best ribs and pulled pork sandwich I've ever had.  Also you must order the stupid fries! My favorite waitor/bartender Steve is quite a delight (such sarcastic humor!) and I'm sad he'll be leaving soon."}
{"text":"Comfortable, laid back environment...fascinating General Manager/Bartender...exceptional food.   Welcome to the neighborhood!  Hope you stay for years and years."}
{"text":"Best BBQ hands down in Cleveland. Service is great and atmosphere is chill. I go at least twice a month and never been disappointed. Highly recommend.."}
{"text":"I dated someone who lived near here, and this was one of the few restaurants we could both agree on pretty much all the time! The staff was so fun and friendly, and the food was just wonderful. Recommend as either a restaurant or a bar."}
{"text":"It's been quite some time since we've dined here. Reason being that we were experiencing a downslide in Cuisine and service. Well after tonight, unfortunately, this will be our last time. 
The service was slow even though there were only 2 table set and then a third everyone, was waiting. The drinks came quickly but the food took quite a while. We found the menu a little confusing mixing the entrees with the ala carte which obviously does not come with sides, but the dinner entrees do. We ordered the St Louis ribs ala carte with a couple of sides.  The coleslaw and baked beans we're great but we found the sauce a little too pungent and the ribs mediocre. We ordered a single out cornbread which was served cold! So sad to say this will be our last time at this restaurant we will be going up and down Lee Road experiencing the new spots that are opening."}
{"text":"I had a BBQ experience over summer that was hauntingly beautiful, and since then I've been both excited and afraid to get ribs again for fear that they wouldn't live up to my summer fling.

The Rib Cage and Hot Sauce Williams seemed like my best bets, and I headed here on a quiet weekday evening. When my friend and I walked through the door, we were greeted by... no one. There was one guy behind the bar who just kinda stared at us and looked away, and a few other patrons scattered around the bar and tables watching sports on TV. Venturing in further, we saw a window counter and asked someone behind there if we were just supposed to seat ourselves (affirmative), so we sat down and eventually the guy behind the bar came and brought over utensils and menus. 

We were pretty excited since it smelled fantastic and they had the goods (ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken), but I had my reservations about the various sauces. Normally I'm not a purist - I come from SF, the land of fusion - but for my return to BBQ I wanted good old-fashioned, no frills, smoky meat. Eventually we ended up getting the St. Louis Style Pork Ribs and a combo plate of Beef Brisket w/ Spicy BBQ Sauce, and Pork Spare Ribs w/ Carolina Mustard Vinegar Sauce with the sauces chosen at the waiter's suggestion. For sides, we got French Fries, Mac n' Cheese, and the ever-faithful cornbread. Plus side salads. 

It didn't take too long for the meat to come after the salads (and I'm willing to wait for good BBQ), but I immediately saw my mistake with the sauces.
- The Beef Brisket, while extremely tender, was practically bathing in a dish of vinegary hot sauce. It was more kimchi than BBQ.
- The Pork Spare Ribs were also lathered in a gooey sauce - I'm not a huge fan of mustard so it may have worked for other people, but I still prefer regular BBQ.
- The St. Louis Style Pork Ribs were definitely the most satisfying of the three in terms of flavor. The meat though was pretty tough and chewy, so I couldn't see myself eating more than two at a time. 
The French Fries and Mac n' Cheese were your standard fare, but the cornbread was pretty good. I'd take seconds of that. 

I can see how this place might have a pub-y charm on a busier night, but the whole place just felt lacking. The staff was much less than enthused despite it being a calm night, and the decorations haven't seen an update in years. I've yet to try out Hot Sauce Williams, but I'll go there first before coming back here."}
{"text":"What's a word that means 'fantastic'? Oh, I got it...THE RIB CAGE!!! The whole menu is great. My favorite is the brisket with the world renown spicy bbq sauce. Make sure you get an extra side of it with whatever you get...just because. Go there now!!!"}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place has so many 5 or even 4 stars!! Maybe the cooks they used to have that knew how to cook no longer work here. I went to this place strictly because I love ribs and when I saw it had 4 stars with over 70 reviews I assumed I was going to be pleased. This was NOT the case at all. 

The pork ribs had no flavor, had hardly any meat on them and the BBQ sauce that was not supposed to be spicy was spicy. Ugh! The fries were decent and the cornbread was good, but the Mac n cheese was absolutely awful. I'm still trying to figure out if it was really Mac n cheese or did they mistakenly give me something else. It looked like yellow baby food. 

I gave 2 stars because the staff was very friendly but I was very disappointed with my meal!"}
{"text":"Stupid fries are stupid good! Wings are delightful, all the dressing and bbq sauces are homemade. Bleu cheese dressing was excellent as was the carolina vinegar and herb buffalo sauces. The greens are awesome! We will one back here! Oh, the cheese and mac is mostly cheese which is a ggod thing! The place is pretty small and cozy!"}
{"text":"Criminal Meat Preparation. 
Delighted by past reviews and proximity brought me to this hole of a bar who's parking lot features paid meters monitored \"24 Hours.\" Not much to look at and disappearing staff makes the experience lengthy.  45 minutes after ordering the half brisket, half st louis rib meal, with collards and cole slaw due to staff recco, what finally came could best be described as Char, and Beef Jerky. Three drastically different size portions of both examples, like some sort of Goldilocks Portion policy, one Rib was completely bare, while its neighbor, was loaded with charred dried grainy meat.  A real shame for $28 I left hungry for bbq and an apology. I should have used the mislabeled diagram of a pig in the restroom as foreshadowing, instead all I will recall is the toilet of an experience.  Don't go here.  I promise you'll thank me."}
{"text":"I really want to rate this place higher, but the service was pretty rough. I came in with a group later on a Sunday evening and with only one guy working, it took a while to get food/refills/check/etc. After we were finished with food, it was about an hour before we even got our checks. On the upside, our waiter was incredibly kind and was really trying hard, he just had so much on his plate he wasn't able to do much for us.

Changing gears, the food was great! I went with the combo plate and paired the pork rib tips with the brisket. For sides, I got the Mac n Cheese and the Baked beans. Rib tips were pretty good, the brisket was excellent, the beans were reeeeeallly good and the mac n cheese was probably the highlight of the meal for me. I really enjoyed the sauce selection, the spicy bbq and carolina mustard vinegar were both great. They had very unique flavors and left my taste buds excited, unlike so many other BBQ places do with their boring, standard BBQ sauces. 

I would absolutely come back here for the food, it is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Visited Cleveland for the first time and as any other major city they always have a type of food or sandwich that they take pride in so the Polish Boy it was. So we  did a little research and found this place. Started off with some beers and an order of the stupid fries with brisket plus an SHOCKING order of Alligator bites! Now let me explain why this was shocking? In my experience you can not find alligator anywhere unless you get closer to Florida but to find these in Cleveland? Amazing. If you never had alligator give it a try it is just like chicken very lean but tasty.

So Polish Boy vs Polish Girl time it is. This place has a variation of it called the Polish Girl just to get us on point. Both were outstanding, they are loaded up, sloppy, get the napkins out and go to town take no prisoners and enjoy a Cleveland's famous Polish Boy.

Service was great, the place is cozy has a Western feel to it and everyone was friendly. I would def return here if I'm in Cleveland."}
{"text":"What's drunk, white, and red all over?  Me after drinking some bourbon and eating some BBQ ribs at this joint.  It well worth the money too.  Do you want some inexpensive, yet quality drinks, and some really delicious BBQ?  If you don't, then you probably hate America (or you just don't like BBQ).  But if you do like BBQ, then your money to The Rib Cage and get your BBQ fill.  This place is a solid choice for beer, brown liquor, and BBQ anything.

The place isn't big and it looks kind of divy.  It's a BBQ joint and it looks exactly like it should.  It's clean, smells good, and the tables are covered with brown paper sheets.  The bar looks like a bar.  There's nothing special here, but it does have some nice modern touches of here and there.  I'm happy with it.  5/5 for appearance.

The bartender was also the server for the night.  It wasn't busy, but he still had a number of patrons at the bar.  He handled our table of four and all the bar patrons together without issue.  He was a really great guy and fun to talk with after the place slowed down.  Service gets a 5/5.

The food was amazing.  My wife and I had rib tips, fried green tomatoes, and wings.  Our friends had ribs, fries, corn bread, brisket sandwich, and the turkey cheddar & beer soup.  The ribs and rib tips were in the standard BBQ sauce and we also go the Carolina mustard sauce on the side.  Both sauces were awesome on their own, but the two mixed together was heaven.  Next time, I'll have them just slather both sauces on my ribs.  Between the two, the Carolina was the best--it has a good tang.  

Everything was smoked to perfection.  I was told they smoke things from 15 to 20 hours.  I would normally think that's too long, but they didn't taste over-smoked at all.  The meat was perfectly tender and they had just the right amount of smoke flavor.   This goes for the brisket and the ribs.  The wings didn't taste smoked, but they were equally tasty.  We tried a few sauces for the wings and all were great.

The sides and the fried green tomatoes were good.  There's not a whole lot to say about fries--these worked and I was happy.  The cornbread was solid--moist and a little sweet.  It wasn't too gritty at all.  The tomatoes were the star side dish for me.  The tomatoes tasted incredibly fresh and the panko fry was perfect.  I could eat them all the time.  

The food isn't special in terms of menu creativity... it's just BBQ.  But in terms of BBQ, this place is top notch.  There are better BBQ joints in some in the south that exist well off the main drags of various cities.  This place is not quite that good, but it's close.  Food gets a 5/5

For desert we had the blackberry & peach cobbler and the bourbon sweet potato pie.  All deserts are served with a couple scoops of vanilla ice cream.  They do not make these in house--I can't recall who they said made the deserts.  What I do recall is that this was one of the best sweet potato pies I've had in a long time.  It was spiced just right and the texture was good.  I usually like to have a bit more of a thicker pie filling, but this thing stood all on its own.  The cobbler was more of a deconstructed cobbler. But it still tasted fresh and delicious.  The fruit wasn't over-sweetened and it let the fresh fruit flavor shine through.  All the deserts felt very home-made, but with a good level of technical skill still present.  Deserts get a 5/5.

Booze gets the final 5/5 score.  They had a massive selection of beers and they have a good collection of about 8 high-quality single-barrel bourbons.  They also have some special bourbon cocktails too.  There prices of the bourbons and beers were quite good and allowed us to avoid bottom shelf swill.  this is a bar where your dollar goes a little farther.

Actually, the entire cost of the food was lower than most other restaurants.  The massive full rack rib dinner was only $14, for example.  Go here, eat cheap, and fill up on good drinks and food.  It's highly worth it."}
{"text":"Great food. You wouldn't expect it by looking at the interior. The bartender was really good too. 
I had the pick two meats with brisket and turkey ribs. The brisket was good but turkey ribs were incredible. Sides were mac and cheese and coleslaw with cornbread. All three were good. Their BBQ sauce was great as well. 
Overall I will definitely be back, mostly for the turkey ribs."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall delicious BBQ. The carolina mustard vinegar sauce is the best. The guy behind the bar was awesome, friendly and definitely encouraged us to come back again. My husband has done carryout a few times here and everything he has ordered holds up. Great wing deal on Wednesdays. 4 stars instead of 5 just because it's a small place and our service was a little slow but that didn't detract from the food at all."}
{"text":"I have no idea where the hell everyone else is getting their four and five star reviews. Did I somehow manage to go to a different Rib Cage? Was I sucked into a wormhole and transported to an alternate universe where everything is the opposite? Whatever the case, I didn't get it at all. 

First of all, let's talk about the location. This tiny little hole-in-the-wall of a bar has changed hands so many times over the last 15 years I've lost count. I lived in Cleveland Heights for nearly 10 years and got to witness most of them first hand. Needless to say, none of the incarnations have been anything much more than dive bars. This latest rendition keeps the tradition alive.

I'm not saying dive bars are a bad thing, just not my thing. The Rib Cage is small, dark (most of the lighting coming from a string of Christmas lights over the bar) and unchanged since the last time I sat at the 10-seat bar sometime back in 2007. It's definitely a shot and a beer joint. One of those two stars is because they had Black Box Brewing Company oatmeal coffee stout on tap. There were three other taps, one being PBR. 

Sure, as others have mentioned, the bartender is pretty friendly. He greeted us when we walked in and took out drink order. After that, it went downhill. Between our appetizer and when our entrees arrived it was over 40 minutes. Yeah, 4-0. Something else worth mentioning, there were four other people in the entire place and two of them weren't even eating. Unacceptable. It's BBQ. Doesn't that pretty much mean that everything is already prepared? What the hell were they doing back there the whole time?

Now for the food. I wasn't impressed. I've had a lot of BBQ and soul food over the years and this stuff was pretty average - at best. Here's what we ordered:

Fried Green Tomatoes: These were probably the best thing we ate. Crispy, not greasy, well-seasoned and the Sriracha mayo drizzle was delicious.

Cornbread: It came with both combos and it was pretty good. I thought it was a little dry but overall not bad. Should have asked for some butter.

Combo Platter #1: Turkey ribs, pulled pork, mac an cheese, slaw. The turkey was tender and juicy and the pulled pork was just OK but the slaw was bland and the mac and cheese reminded me of Stouffer's without the salt.

Combo Patter #2: Rib tips, brisket, greens and baked beans. Not good at all. The rib tips were extremely chewy and filled with bits of cartilage, all but one piece of the brisket was edible, the rest was gelatinous fat. The greens were OK, on the salty side, but the bakes beans were tasty - smoky, sweet and spicy.

Some other missteps:
Everything was pretty spicy - the mac and cheese, the baked beans, and even the greens all had a significant level of heat. We ordered the regular BBQ sauce and even I was surprised by how much heat it had. I like heat just not to the point where it numbs my taste buds for the entire meal.

We ordered two different sauces on one of the samplers and it was delivered with only one.

The service was inattentive. By the time we had gotten half-way through our meal the place was empty. We weren't given waters, they don't have iced tea (A BBQ joint that doesn't have iced tea?) and our server spent most of the time leaning on the bar chatting with the bartender. We also watched as a party of two actually had to come up to the bar to ask for their bill.

There's no reason that I'd ever come back to the Rib Cage. It's essentially a tiny dive bar that serves ho-hum BBQ/soul food."}
{"text":"Delicious soul food. Best BBQ place I have found in the Cleveland area. Try the pulled pork and Mac and cheese. Great beer selection. Huge portions. Reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Was looking for a late night eatery open past midnight and i found this gem.  This place has some great food! So good, i ordered take out 17 hours later!  Because I was unfamiliar with the food, for my midnight fix I ordered a few side dishes and an appetizer. I really recommend the Grilled Gulf Shrimp paired with the Sweet Thai Chili sauce, Cheese Mac and Baked Beans. The Cheese Mac is made with cheddar, gouda and american cheese topped with toasted panko bread.  Best damn mac and cheese....hands down. Like others have mentioned, the wait time can be long but I think it's worth it. Perfection takes time and if your short for time, order take out!"}
{"text":"\"If it ain't broke don't fix it\"  

The bartender is no longer there and the new guy said \"he went to Mexico\" I'm not sure if he ment that literally  or not lol

The 'stupid fries' are now terrible and soggy. 

Also, there is a weird smell of gas in the place and the new bartender assured me it was only the sewer which occasionally creates a odor in the bar(thanks for that comforting detail before I eat here).

On the bright side if your not hungry and your congested you can still order a drink."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place ages ago, just got around to checking it out yesterday and I'm very glad we did. I got the No Condiments burger, as was recommended by my friend. You can get cheese or bacon on it, and it comes with lettuce and onion, but I ate it just bun and beef and it's easily one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life. Putting anything else on it would be a mistake! My girlfriend got the beef brisket sandwich and it was very good. The fries were very good seasoned fries and came in quite a large portion. I also got a side of the cheese mac - one minor complaint, parts of the cheese Mac were a little cold which was unfortunate because it was otherwise delicious, creamy mac & cheese.

Also, I need to mention that our server was excellent. She was very polite & helpful - exactly what you want from a server! No complaints there!

All in all, it was a great experience. We will be returning for sure.

EDIT: forgot to mention, solid beer list/well stocked bar. Had a good IPA on draft I hadn't tried before."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Tasted like my very southern Nana's home cooking. We had the ribs and chicken- both with the traditional BBQ Sauce which was creamy and completely delicious! Sides included corn and macaroni and cheese. The Mac and cheese totally blew us away. Creamy and flavorful, but not too heavy. Service was friendly and timely, ambiance was relaxed and pleasant. Price is very reasonable for the amount of food you get! A++"}
{"text":"Even though I had an awesome first experience, I couldn't help but be bothered about tonight's go at $2 taco Tuesday. The food was still amazing, but the service was so slow that we only got checked on twice in an hour. There was one server who spent most of his time socializing instead of checking on his tables."}
{"text":"Have only had their green fried tomatoes but they are probably the best I've had EVER. Definitely a place with a lot of character with its bourbon and interesting relics."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the waiter. But even he was really slow with service due to be overworked. We waited ten minutes before even getting menus. But the waiter was very helpful and kind.

The wings had potential. I called before arriving to see how the wings were prepared I was told they were baked and fried until crisp. The wings had potential. However, they were baked and only baked. As a result they were soft, soggy, and pretty fatty. I'm sure frying them would have prevented all of that. But they must have skipped frying them. I'm guessing due to being so busy. The Mac and Cheese was pretty bad as well.my kids wouldn't even eat it. The fries were good and seasoned well but not much fry in the middle... all crisp!

I'm just happy I went on wing night. 10 wings for $5 bucks isn't really a loss. Just wish they lived up to the reviews. I would have definitely returned to this place back in my John Carroll days with friends but not in the current day unfortunately."}
{"text":"Walked into the bar and got an extensive lesson on Cleveland nightlife history, all about whiskey/scotch, and comparisons to New York City. Love the place, the manager is pretty awesome. I ate very light; had the turkey and cheddar soup. I will be there again with a more hearty appetite, as the location is close to home."}
{"text":"Great dinner, pulled pork, bbq beans, fresh cut fries. So good! Good beer selection. Only regret - they were out of peanut butter pie with pretzel and oreo crust. Will be back."}
{"text":"Being a neighborhood guy, decided to stop in with another couple without knowing much about the place.  Got there at about 7:30 on a Friday and sat at the bar (plenty of open tables at that time).  Bartender was a really nice guy, took time to explain the menu and their philosophy.  Ordered a few beers and some bourbon and started with the fried green tomatoes (awesome).  

So far so good.

Ordered pulled pork and pork ribs with different sauces.  Entrees were excellent and the sides were very very good.  Corn bread hit the spot.  

Overall, great food, good value, and a great addition to the neighborhood.  Will definitely return and will be sure to tell friends about the place."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ. 

My boyfriend and I moved to Cleveland from Missouri, and he's a major BBQ critic. I'm so happy that we finally found a place in our neighborhood where he can get his fix! The main dishes were well done, but let's not forget the sides. Every side that I sampled was fantastic. Of those I tried, the greens with smoked turkey was by far my favorite."}
{"text":"Horrible...the mac n cheese was bad...came out cold, noodles over cooked, literally made me sick twenty minutes after eating it. Brisket was tough, fries were cold and greasy, best wings of 2013? They tasted that old. The ribs were tough as well. Coleslaw tasted old and had a sour taste. Rib tips, more like a leather belt...the gnats were everywhere..
The beer was cold but wouldn't recommend this place to anyone..."}
{"text":"I have no idea where the bad reviews coming from!  They must be just too picky!  Cleveland isn't known barbecue if you're from the South or West.  The sauces can defiantly hold there own anywhere.  Mustard sauce is incredible.  If they would sell and ship by the jar or gallon I'd be having it shipped to me.  Spicy BBQ is perfect.  Fries awesome.  This Cue is awesome.  The service is quick and right on in a Cleveland kinda way.  When the waiter came up first thing he said...hey how ya doing? What I a get ya?  Right on.  Get some!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! I recommend anything smoked! I wasn't a fan of the cornbread tho, it was more corn CAKE. But then, my mama is from Texas, so I'm biased"}
{"text":"Fantastic! The onion rings are delicious. I had the 'not so Philly cheesesteak' and it was so good. My husband had the St. Louis style ribs as did my daughter and they both loved them. Everything was delicious. So nice to have a spot like this in the Heights!"}
{"text":"What an amazing find in the Cedar Lee area.  The hubby and I both got the 2 meat platter and wish we could have tried all the meats on the list.  The St. Louis ribs were tender, smokey and oh so flavorful!  The pork and beef were delicious and the chicken wings were enormous! We wish we could have had more!  The amount of fries they gave you was mound-ful, the maple bourbon beans were melt in your mouth delicious and I wish I could have had another piece of cornbread.  Yum Yum Yum and we will have to go back!"}
{"text":"I hate to give this place a so-so review because the staff was so nice but I wasn't crazy about my experience. I paid $13 for \"brisket stupid fries\" which are basically fries covered in brisket and beans and sauce. There was almost no meat on it. I would have ordered the brisket sandwich (which is cheaper) if I knew that was going to be the case. The flavors were decent but I can't get past paying $13 for what was essentially barbecue flavored fries."}
{"text":"I'd love to review the food at The Rib Cage, but unfortunately, they never served my friend and me. I can only surmise that it was because of our race.

We visited on Saturday, November 4 after a week of planning. We had been recommended the Rib Cafe by an acquaintance at a fun bar in Coventry and were excited about the visit.

Sadly, after ordering a beer and getting a recommendation from the bartender, we never received any food. We watched other parties come in after us, eat and receive excellent service. Of course, they were a different color than us. Even the other patrons noticed, saying that they were surprised to receive their food so quickly as we had been waiting for ours and had been there much earlier.

We asked about our order only to find out that the kitchen did not even start our order. When we said they could just cancel and we paid our bar tab (and still tipped) the bartender seemed relieved to see us leave.

Wish they would have just told us to our face that they don't serve our kind.

Sad that race still seems to play a role in dining in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Extremely delicious BBQ, great atmosphere and great prices. The turkey ribs are my favorite. Their BBQ sauce is heavenly and their staff is incredibly helpful. I like hole in the wall places like this. They always have the best staff and the best food. We've been there a few times now and have also gotten take out. We've never been disappointed. Great selection of beer as well. Thanks guys! We look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I just had an emotional experience with my bbq chicken, collard greens with turkey sausage and burbon beans. Amazzzing. They had an awesome drummer/guitarist playing and the music was great."}
{"text":"My first time here we wanted to try a variety of things. The waitress/bartender was great at coming back and forth to check on us.  She also gave us some great recommendations for food.  We ended up getting 2 combos so we can try all different kinds of meats and sauces.  Unfortunately by the time we got our food it was already getting cold so some of it was kind of disappointing.  I wasn't a fan of the beans and I think the mac and cheese may have been better if it was hot... Of the meats we got, the TURKEY RIBS (recommended by the waitress) were definitely my favorite.  If I come back it'd probably be for those alone. The Carolina Mustard Vinegar were a good sauce to go with those (we asked for the sauces on the side so they weren't slathered in sauce). The corn bread here is pretty phenomenal too. The other ribs we got were decent and the pulled pork/brisket were just ok.  

The restaurant itself has a bar and then a small dining area in back, not a huge place. 
But it's a nice laid back atmosphere. While most of the food was just okay, the turkey ribs were the saving grace. I hear they also have whiskey cocktails so I'll have to order one of those next time."}
{"text":"Ok so I've been here about 8 times the drinks are good and the prices also, they have to compete with all day happy hour next door. Anyway people are very nice but other than the wing dings, mac n cheese (which def be improved) and perch the food needs help or a better cook. I've ordered whole wings and crab bites that were not cooked completely. I got fish with hair, undercooked soft fries and warm cole slaw, rib tips smothered in sauce (a sign of meat that is less than quality). Come on the menu is great test your own food and make sure your timing how long you need to cook food and write it down, only serve food that is excellent!!! I am a cook, this is not difficult food to prepare other than the smoking/BBQing  and side dish prep please do better."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Worst service I have had in ages clearly seemed like our table of four was a bother to our server simply by ordering food. Ribs were cold and tough and not sauced as requested. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I had the ribs and brisket. I also had collard greens and French fries. The entire meal was really tasty. Tried several different sauces and all were good. The service was great. I'm from out of town and this is what I would call a local dive. Nothing fancy. Great place to have a drink and a meal, and watch some sports. I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to try this out after we read the reviews and he needed a good BBQ fix.  We were not disappointed! The pulled pork and brisket were wonderful and very juicy.  Their sides were clearly made from scratch, some of the best baked beans, mac & cheese and corn bread we've had.  Can't wait to go back and sample the apps and dessert!"}
{"text":"Below average barbeque, wings were average, and the salad was great. All of the meat was over cooked. The server/bartender was great maybe the best server I've had this year. I would only go back for drinks or the salad"}
{"text":"I was told about this place by my sister who enjoyed the ribs. I don't eat red meat so I was excited to try the smoked wings. I ordered a 7 piece with South Carolina Mustard vinegar sauce and although they didn't taste as Smokey as I'd hoped they were pretty good. HOWEVER, I ordered greens, Mac n cheese and cornbread to go with it and it was EXTREMELY disappointing. The mac n cheese was literally the worst I've ever had. It was soupy with a chalky texture and completely inedible. The greens were good but the container literally housed about 5 bites, the cornbread was delicious  but I was surprised that it was ice cold! The meal.WAS NOT worth the almost $18 that I paid for it. And because I could not eat the macaroni I am still starving. I will  NEVER eat there again."}
{"text":"Went here after some cocktails and it was super delicious! The food was divine, and they source almost everything locally. With the ribs, you can expect to gnaw around cartilage, but the smokey flavor was awesome.  Will definitely be heading back again. The mac and cheese and beans are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Nice little southern restaurant. Brought my boyfriend from the south and he thought it reminded him of home. Nice selection of beer. The space was pretty small so probably need to call ahead for a big party. 
I had the wings and they were good. Except I was looking for a spicier sauce then they have. Waitress was nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Roller coaster ride.  Sometimes bad, sometimes food.  Lots of attitude when you call them out on it.  If they figure it out, could be a cool spot."}
{"text":"Read all the reviews and was eager to try. Decided on take out and while the bartender was pleasant enough, I really, really hate being called honey, dearest and sweetheart which he called me over and over. Got the beef ribs with Carolina sauce, chicken, sweet potato pie, greens, Mac/cheese. Ribs were tough and could not be eaten off the bone because the tough fascia stuck to the meat. The Carolina sauce tastes like Heinz 57 steak sauce and is strong. The chicken, which apparently was the last one, was dry. The greens were meh but no one makes greens like my mom. Sweet potato pie was good but needed more crust. Mac /cheese a bit bland.  I threw away my half of the ribs and picked over half the chicken leaving the other half of the meat and corn for my son. The next morning it was all still on the table, picked over. I threw it out. He said it was awful. I felt validated."}
{"text":"Stumbling your way home drunk on Lee Road? Get the stupid fries. You will not regret it.

Stupid drunk? Stupid fries!

We've also had the chicken wings and the rib tips, Everything has been awesome. The owner is knowledgeable and loves to talk about food. Eat here! Note, you could also get drunk here if you were so inclined."}
{"text":"Went for dinner at The Rib Cage based on reviews I read.  It's a good thing,  I would have never chosen to enter this joint based on looks alone. With our vehicle in the convenient parking next door,  I thought of leaving the windows open in the hope that the wonderful Bbq smell emanating from the place would linger in the car for some time... 

All three of us ordered the baby back ribs with Carolina mustard vinegar BBQ sauce.  The ribs were moist,  meaty,  and the surprisingly wonderful sauce made this a memorable experience. 

The sides were OK. The mac and cheese rich cheese sauce was a mismatch with the bland taste.  Coleslaw was ordinary and a bit too sweet.  But we give full marks to the Bourbon beans; those were worth noting. 

I regret not trying the turkey ribs. Next time for sure.  Our waiter's description alone made us wonder how big can turkeys be in Ohio??!! 

A recommended stop. I was surprised the place was not packed,  given that it was on the eve of the Browns opening game."}
{"text":"Always friendly service, but most of all, I love their good quality/consistent food. Price is very reasonable and coming from California to find a good bar food and ribs, this place was a bulls eye. Coming here once a week."}
{"text":"Came here for late(r) night wings with some friends and ended up getting a tri-tip sandwich as well.

The BBQ sauce is on point; the sandwich was just as expected. Nothing super special, but it was GOOD FOOD, and great atmosphere.

Wings were great! They mix things up a little: the Buffalo came with blue cheese mixed into the coat already, which made it super unique. Very nice. Overall though, the spicy BBQ flavor had to be my favorite. Jerk was a little salty, but not too bad either. They were cooked (baked, I think?) perfectly: not bone dry like some of Buffalo Wild Wings'.

The service was top notch, waiter was on point."}
{"text":"Finally got my husband to try this with me last night and he and our friend were delighted - as was I! I've spent more time than I care to admit in this building when it was Dough Boys so I wondered if it would feel strange in this new iteration, but it did not.  The food was wonderful - my husband and I had the pulled pork and my friend had the beef brisket.  My favorite part had to be the greens which were even better than Mama Joyce's - my former favorite greens in the Heights.  My friends praised the mac and cheese (and inhaled it within seconds of its arrival) and the fresh cut fries sprinkled with seasoning were great.  The Carolina Mustard Sauce and Herb Buffalo wings were also great.  A word of warning - I was initially taken aback but the texture of the pulled pork.  Then I realized my barbecue life is so bare - I've never had pulled pork from anything but a crock pot.  If you're like me, don't expect it to be disintegrating on your plate like you're used to.  But the meat was tender and delicious and I'd eat it again in a heart beat.  They had fancy sodas too and while it seemed a bit silly to have indie Diet Coke, it tasted as good as diet coke so no complaints here.  The restaurant filled up quite a bit while we were there and the one server who was also the bartender did seem to get \"too\" busy, but honestly he was so nice and we didn't wait more than 10 minutes more than we wanted to, and he was pretty hilarious and charming so this is less a complaint and more a warning for the impatient.  Be patient, the service is great!"}
{"text":"Went here because of good reviews on yelp. The food was tasty, bartender was nice, great selection of bourbon. Beer selection could be better. I would definitely go back again. Thumbs up from both me and my girlfriend."}
{"text":"I've been to the Rib Cage at least four times now, as it's the closest thing to real goddamn BBQ outside of Kansas City I've had in FOUR years.  It's not Oklahoma Joe's, but it serves tender slow cooked meat with abundance of flavors.  Further, it has plenty of options for those who believe it's about the sauce (I'm from KC, what can I say) as well as more vinegar based sauces that let the meat shine.  There's something for everyone.  

I have now sampled the Pulled Pork sandwich with the Carolina style sauce, the Brisket sandwich with the Spicy BBQ sauce, the Turkey-beer-cheese soup, the Blackened Catfish, the Parmesan Garlic Tilapia, the hushpuppies, the Bourbon-maple-bacon beans, the seasoned fries, collard greens, and some eggnog-vodka-schnapps Christmas cocktail that was like a boozy Christmas morning with sprinkles and whipped cream. (I regret nothing.)   

First, the Pulled Pork has been the most consistent with its juicy, oh so tender goodness that only comes from pork.  It's very, very, very good and never disappoints.  The Brisket was to die for tender and moist the first time, but the second time it was too dry and mediocre.  The Blackened Cafish was moist, cooked perfectly, fresh and was spicy enough that I may have had 4 glasses of water while dining.  

The surprising standouts are the non-obvious choices.  The beans have real flavor and serious depth. They have truly elevated baked beans to a must-have side dish, which I didn't know was possible.  Don't get me wrong, I love the crispy well seasoned fries, but the beans!  The Turkey-Beer soup is a knock out, too.  As a KC raised girl, I never thought I'd ever tell someone \"Hey you should go to this BBQ place and have the soup.\" WTF, but it's true. Have the satisfying, filling, cheesy goodness of that soup. 

This will continue to be my standby for BBQ cravings in the CLE. You should check it out, and some of you will appreciate the proprietor's use of locally sourced meats and ingredients."}
{"text":"I tried Rib Cage when it first opened, pretty hearty solid food and atmosphere is relaxed"}
{"text":"This food is different from other places as it's highly, highly seasoned...think a ton of Lowry's on the fries, and plenty of spices in general.  
We ordered takeout; there was only one cook and he was slammed, but he did his best.  He sauced some wings that were supposed to be plain, but that's ok.  The rib tips were ok (I've never had them before and I don't care for them, but my dude and kid liked them), the poor girl sandwich was actually a poor boy sandwich as they forgot the pulled pork on top.  Again, I know what it's like to be on my own on the line, so I don't fault the cook.  The mac and cheese is slightly spicy, but some of the best I've tasted!  The wings, even unsauced ones, are delicious; they have very little fat and plenty of flavor.  You can eat these without any sauce and you'll be satisfied.  These are definitely not your chain restaurant bland and rubbery wings!
If you want a hot-sauce Williams type of food that's very stick to your ribs, this is the place for you.  If you have high blood pressure, or are watching your salt intake, know that this is probably not the best place, lol.
I'm glad I found this place, as I've been looking for a winking lizard replacement. 
Owner: help the cook out! :)"}
{"text":"Be sure to get a dessert cuz they're the real deal southern dishes"}
{"text":"Food is very good. I personally recommend the Turkey Ribs. Very delicious and not something you'll find very many places. The french fries were also a very pleasant surprise. I was not personally in love with the sauce, but it was by no means bad and I view that as more of a personal taste thing. 

Had a bit of a dive bar feel to it, which I personally liked as it feels \"homey\" to me. Not for everyone, but I thought it was quaint. 

The servers were very nice and laid back. The one big knock on this place was I got the impression that it was a bar first and a restaurant/grill second. I've waited for 45 min+ for food both times I went there. However, I would say the food and friendly atmosphere made up for it."}
{"text":"Came here to drink and was super pleased.  The bartender (and owner?) was extremely pleasant, knowledgeable (without being smug), and makes some mighty fine drinks.  It felt like how a great neighborhood bar should be with a nice cosy intimate atmosphere (not posh, not dive). They also have a wonderful selection of beers and whiskey.  What a great addition to the neighborhood!

After reading the reviews here, I obviously have to try the food."}
{"text":"This place has wonderful food and great drinks. I've been here a few times. Great music today! But y'all need to have more than one bartender serving the bar and all of the other tables at 8PM on a Friday. I asked for some ranch dressing for my wings - which were great - and it sat in the window for about 8 minutes. 

To be clear, the bartender was doing as best of a job she could - but she was spread way to thin. Spot check - 6 people at the bar, six tables with 15 people - 21 in total. All tended by one person. Im not sure how anyone could handle that reasonably."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect of this place before going, but was surprised by the cleanliness of the place. I am a fan of the cardboard paper that covers all the tables - inviting patrons to get messy. The service we received was great. However, the food was only mediocre. We tried the St Louis style ribs as recommended by others online, and I was not impressed. The flavor was just okay, the meat didn't fall off the bone, and there was a lot of fat. I do recommend trying the fried green tomatoes. Also I thought the menu items were priced too high (I.e. $6 draft beer). Overall, not a terrible place, but one could easily find a better place to dine."}
{"text":"Food is still great and the staff are still friendly, but the service speed has severely tanked.

We went recently and waited almost an hour for our dinner on an otherwise slow night.

Just stopped in for lunch and waited 30 minutes for chili and a corned beef sandwich.

Going to have to make sure I'm ready for a wait in the future."}
{"text":"So my husband and I gave this place a try in September 2012, shortly after they launched because my sister and brother-in-law gave it rave reviews.  I was less impressed.  While the bartender/GM was on his game and recommended fantastic beer, the food was sub par.  The ribs were extremely dry and flavorless.

We vowed never to go back, but after some encouragement from my sister, we decided to give it one more try.  Much better!  The bartender/GM was full of stories and quite entertaining and the food was much more flavorful and not dry.  

I am glad I gave it one more shot....I'll be back."}
{"text":"such a bummer.  food is good, but super unreliable for catering & wait times to get served are laughable.  

after we inquired about the possibility of catering our wedding, the bartender/catering guy seemed super geeked for the job.  he gave us a biz card & told us to call back to set up an appt.  i called, left a message...crickets. 

called again, talked to the GM - who promised we'd get a call back \"asap\" - nothing.  

thanks for nothing, rib cage!"}
{"text":"Great ribs and beans. The chicken wings were large and very tasty. The brisket was on the dry side without the sauce but still tasty.  Try the ribs without the sauce because they are very good."}
{"text":"Walked in at 7pm on a Saturday night and the place was empty. They legitimately had to turn on the lights for us. We watched the chefs and a waitress all walk into the kitchen and all say \"oh my god\" and \"ew\" for 5 minutes and decided to stick around after reading more reviews on here. Ordered our food and drinks - meat came out cold still. My friend stopped eating his because it was rubbery. Service was less than good. I was excited for this and I got let down. Please don't go here."}
{"text":"Just moved to Cleveland a few months ago. Was looking for good BBQ and this place was highly rated on Yelp. Seemed like the place to go. Unfortunately, it was not good...at all. Possibly the worst BBQ I've ever had. Not sure if I caught them on a bad night or what but it was bad. Service was great and the ambiance was cool (dive bar-esque) but food was nowhere even close to being good. Wish I had better news to report...seems like this place may have once reigned as top dog for BBQ but have since lost its crown."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and decided to give it a try.
Small place but the staff is very friendly. We ordered drinks that were made decent. The Friend Green Tomatoes were very good!!
The rib tips were seasoned very well and were good enough to eat without the sauce. Wanted to try the Pulled Pork, but the portion sizes didnt allow for that.
Overall a good experience and will go back soon."}
{"text":"Good bar service. Food overcooked, underseasoned. Long wait time. Definitely not the place for your BBQ fix. Live music nice touch"}
{"text":"Finally checked out this bbq joint. On entrance, I wasn't impressed. Everyone was at the bar, and the bartender had some dirty pan with oil and was waving it around, joking about it with the customers. Moving on... we sat ourselves in the back of the restaurant (completely empty btw). Atmosphere is unimpressive, but I didn't come here for fine dining. 

Ordered drinks. Bf got some hoppy beer, which had this really funky (in a good way) smell, and was actually quite delicious (has a kick to it). I usually don't like beer, so this was some really good stuff. I ordered hard cider. The waitress brought out a 4/5 filled glass, and said it was on the house since it was at the bottom of the keg. Sweeeet. Love free stuff. + 1 star for the hospitality. 

The food... so much yummy sounding stuff on the menu. Ultimately, decided on stupid fries. Fries with beans and slaw topped with a heavy layer of cheese. SO yummy. I don't even like beans or slaw, but the slaw really really complimented the fries. It was not too cabbagey, and had a nice vinegary taste. However, I did not like the beef brisket in the fries; the brisket pieces were fatty, and not what I expected.

The main entrees. My friend got 1/2 turkey ribs and 1/2 of something else - forgot what sauce she got. Bf got spicy bbq St. Louis ribs. He really liked it. Friend and bf did not like the collard greens that they picked as their sides, but more for me! I got pulled pork with carolina bbq sauce. Dish came with a piece of corn bread (which was meh - fell apart before I could put on the butter), two sides. I loved the mac and cheese. The mac had lots of cream in it, and was also topped with another heavy layer of cheese. Very flavorful. Collard greens was slightly too salty for my taste, but still really really flavorful. Has some nice turkey pieces inside. Pulled pork had a nice tang, was juicy and succulent. 

WAY TOO MUCH FOOD. 

The only thing I didn't like were the prices. Wish they would offer 1/2 the dish for 1/2 the cost. Maybe next time, I'll get the pulled pork sandwich, and try the fried green tomatoes."}
{"text":"This place is weird. It makes me feel like i'm in Texas or Arizona or something. I ordered a platter of combo. The food was only ok. EXCEPT the turkey option, which was pretty impressive. Other stuff was very meh. The waitress was kinda lazy. she didnt seem to be very interested in us, although she did come over to check on us when she saw me starring at her."}
{"text":"Great staff. Funny bartender that made the night awesome. Food was very good as well. Smoked brisket sandwich just fell apart, as it should. Fries were homemade, and they also had a tremendous beer selection. I would go back."}
{"text":"My poor review of The Rib Cage is due primarily to the fact that I've been left with a nasty case of the bubble guts each time I've eaten there. Pre-bubble guts I've found the food to be fairly mediocre as far as BBQ goes. I feel like there are better options in the area."}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Especially the smoke chicken wings. Food didn't take long to get and was great."}
{"text":"Best wings in Cleveland!!!, the wings are smoked and it makes all the difference, there is a nice crust on each wing and they are cooked thoroughly and the sauce selection is great, personal favs being the buffalo and spicy BBQ. Service was speedy and friendly also to go along with the great food!"}
{"text":"I would give it 1 star, but the corn bread saved it and bumped it to a 2star... so I guess it's really a 1.5 that's been bumped to a 2.

I'm not sure how much all the other reviewers had to drink before rating the food here, but it's definitely NOT top notch BBQ.  I was hoping based on other reviews that I would be able to rave about finding another hole in the wall with amazing food, but alas...

The BBQ ribs were dry, the jerk rubs was too salty to eat, and the water tasted like drinking the swimming pool water.  I ordered the turkey ribs (recommended by the waitress as the best thing on the menu) and the pork ribs- they were both dry as heck. The jerk seasoning could have been good, but it was so salty that I couldn't eat the ribs without scraping it off. The corn bread was amazingly good, and the side of fries were very well seasoned and delicious. But it's a sad day when the star of the meal is a side of fries and corn bread. I also ordered a soda when I realized that I couldn't drink the waster, but the soda also tasted unusually foul. I ended up deciding that it must be something about the water, and the soda was maybe ruined with the ice. So I got a bottle of Heineken and enjoyed it.

You won't find me coming back here, not unless it's just for a bottled beer.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist.  I guess I'll come along if someone wants to go. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going. If they insist, I may come and not eat, or may just see them some other time."}
{"text":"We made reservations for four for Friday night 4/6/18 at 7:30, two hours before our movie at the Cedar Lee. Promptly seated and orders taken. Dining area was beginning to fill up. A party of six arrived shortly before us and we watched as their entrees began to come out in 10 minute intervals. Never a good sign. Our appetizer came as we placed an order for a second round of drinks. At about 8:30 the waitress came and asked if we had received our food. She inquired with the kitchen who told her they had LOST OUR TICKET!  They had too many orders in the works and would not be able to prepare ours in the time we had remaining. She immediately offered apologies and comped our drinks and appetizer. I soooo wanted to try their BBQ. What a let down. Definitely felt like they were understaffed. I know mistakes happen, but this has never happened to me before. Went two doors down to Lopez. In and out in 40 minutes."}
{"text":"Ordered the crazy fries and the  turkey rib dinner. First time there, it is expensive however. The food is really good so I can't complain, turkey ribs were not too dry they were actually very moist and really good & it is not easy to cook turkey and everybody can't do that. Also the mac & cheese was really good I saw a review on here that said the mac & cheese was really bland, I didn't think it was bland at all and and I come from a family that loves mac & cheese. The baked beans were good I'm not a fan of big kidney beans and they do have big kidney beans in their baked beans but it's not too bad because the beans aren't hard like most kidney beans are. They are soft and really easy to chew  you kind of get past it after the first two spoonfuls. Also crazy fries are good and they're actually a meal by themselves as they come the large box. I'm not sure what the sauce is that they put on everything but it's interesting it's not too spicy really hard to describe. I ordered takeout and with take out if the bar is full it's really hard to get someone's attention. I was at the very end of the bar standing it took a bout five minutes for someone to get to me but no worries. The two guys behind the bar were very nice and very kind to me."}
{"text":"Eaten here several times. Polish boys, chicken and fried green tomatoes were all winners. I love BBQ and there are few if any good places to get it in Cleveland so I am very happy this place opened up just down the street. As I bourbon lover, this place is great too as they have a wide selection and a knowledgeable bartender to point you in the right direction. Only knock for me was a slim selection of draft beers (I believe there was only 2 last time I was there and 1 was a hard cider). Either way I'll be back and have told all of my friends and family to check this out if they want good BBQ in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ, knowledgeable bar tenders, extremely well made drinks, and a unique atmosphere. What's not to love?

Their Carolina BBQ sauce is incredible, not only does it compliment the tender and succulent meat, but also allows the experience to linger. Been here numerous times and they've never disappointed. Also some of the best Mac and Cheese in Cleveland. 

Pass up Melt and hit up this place; sorry Michael, you've been one-upped."}
{"text":"My all time favorite place to eat or drink in Cleveland. Best barbecue in town, awesome service, great beer. Those wings...my god."}
