{"text":"I had the aloo matar in a wrap and it was fantastic! Only $6 and a perfect size for a lunch. It was so flavorful and the perfect amount of spice. I don't like hot spicy things which makes it hard to find Indian food that I love but this had spices that were not hot! Very flavorful!"}
{"text":"I love the environment and the service is top tier! It's deff not authentic Indian food. But it's still good. I've had 2 different things from there and each one had a salty taste to it. Not really something I enjoyed. But other than that pretty good. 
The seating inside and outside is wonderful and has a very modern feel. Will return. I only wish the food was more authentic."}
{"text":"Prime location on Murray Hill Rd. in Little Italy, with outside seating. Great grab-and-go Indian food. The rice bowls are a full meal at a great price point (roughly $6). I've been several times and have always had a positive experience. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Excellent little gem in Little Italy! Funn environment, and delicious, AUTHENTIC Indian food! Smoothies are great, and the weekly rotation specials keeps thing different. Worthwhile to go. Ask for Gabriella cause she's got it going on and knows what's up!"}
{"text":"Every wrap is filled with delicious, savory flavor, and the bread itself is thin and flaky, which makes the whole thing just melt in your mouth. I haven't tried the rice bowls because I can't get past how good the wraps are."}
{"text":"Wonderful, fast, and sooo comfortable.  Helpful wait/counter staff. Not too spicy, but certainly flavorful. Whimsically decorated for Halloween. Inexpensive to boot."}
{"text":"Speaking as an Indian American: Hooray.

Most of the Indian people I know do not like Indian restaurants.  There is a considerable difference between typical restaurant fare and how we eat at home.  Restaurant fare is goopy and goes overboard with mystery gravy, and as a result, everything tastes just about the same.

Chutney Rolls is different.  The Sabzi's/curry's are 'homestyle', meaning more vegetables, less creamy goop.  This is hard to find at mainstream Indian restaurants.  Heat levels were ok, but the owner explained to me that the place's process makes it difficult to prepare the heat levels to order.  Instead, if you ask for something hot, they give you extra chutney (which I assume is cilantro chutney).

I'm not that much in love with the concept -- chipotle-style wrap, rice, or salad -- but I think the restaurant makes a lot of interesting choices within that concept.  The 'wraps' are actually made with parathas, but I didn't have a chance to try them.  One of my dining mates had the aloo mattar on rice, and wasn't in love with the rice.  I got the salad on the side of my aloo methi.  The salad is cabbage-based, which is smart, because a lettuce salad would wilt under a hot sabzi ... and I think the salad is dressed with chaat masala, maybe?  Another dining mate had the palak paneer on top of the salad, and liked that as well.

And the aloo methi -- this was FANTASTIC.  And a hard item to find on any other indian restaurant's menu.  The lassis, apparently, are made to order on the spot with a vitamix, and after one alteration, my dining partners really loved them (sweet and salt alike).

I do have complaints.  I think the containers, foil, plastic silverware, etc. provided to dining-in customers are excessive, and produce too much waste.  I suppose if this were a conventional restaurant serving homestyle food, rather than a fast casual restaurant serving homestyle food, I would be inclined to want to give it (an impossible) six stars.  I'm told that the salt lassi and palak paneer both had a little too much salt.  I think it would be nice if they had a different way to pump up the heat level than by merely providing a medium-hot chutney on the side ... but I understand why this isn't quite possible yet.  Sriracha would adulterate the cuisine, for example.

Keep it up, chutney rolls! I will be coming back!

Oh, one other minor thing -- your samosas aren't 'artesian', they're 'artisanal' ... I'm guessing."}
{"text":"Yum, Chutney Rolls. Cute storefront w. seating in Little Italy, near Case Western. You get your choice of wrap, bowl (with rice) or salad. I recommend the wrap. They use paratha, which is like a flaky, super tasty tortilla with your choice of filling (chicken, lamp or veg) and topped with fresh cabbage slaw. Pros: Delicious food that fills you up without that gross \"I ate too much processed crap\" feeling. Friendly, quick service. Good options for vegetarians and carnivores. Cons: None."}
{"text":"I have tried this restaurant on a few occasions and the last time but better than the first.  Each time I have had the chutney wrap,  the last time was appropriate for walking around the farmers market and enjoyable. It was spicy and good.
I think however I am not a fan of Indian fusion. 
I sometimes think that things should remain the same. It is hard enough trying to find an authentic Indian restaurant (I miss my friend who would invite me to her home for home cooked Indian cuisine), but putting the 'fusion' spin..
Okay I guess. ..for those who are unfamiliar."}
{"text":"The staff & Owner are friendly and helpful.  If you aren't familiar with Indian food, here is a great place to start!  The menu is uncomplicated & un-intimidating, while still giving you a great taste for the flavor of Indian food."}
{"text":"Matt was an awesome server. Great at explaining the menu to first timers. Food was great - really flavorful and the price was right. Went with family group and we shared a chicken wrap, lamb chicken rice bowl and lamp sweet potatoe salad. All were delicious. That being said, the plastic bowls were difficult to eat out of and took away from the dining experience hence the reason for 4 stars. ."}
{"text":"I called Chutney Rolls searching for a place to hold dinner on my graduation weekend.  I was looking for a place with great food and a warm atmosphere.  I had used this restaurant previously to cater a law school group function (this restaurant is a Case Western Reserve University School of Law favorite, FYI), and I knew that the food would be a big hit with my family.
  
The pressure was on to find the perfect place, and a neutral enough zone so that both my family and my in-laws could mingle in one big group.  I was put in touch with the founder/owner, Hrishue, who worked with us to make the big dinner a smashing success.

Chutney Rolls accommodated my entire family and my in-laws (18 people total), and accommodated special dietary needs (i.e. they are one of the few restaurants in Cleveland that carry halal options).  They reserved the entire restaurant for our party, and even provided their patio seating in case the weather cooperated (which it did not; it was freezing).  Their parking behind the restaurant was also a huge, huge bonus.

The day of the big dinner, both families ate, drank, and laughed the night away.  We had children in our party, and the games the restaurant provided were a huge hit. Everyone left happy and satisfied, and the employees were kind and cooperated by taking numerous giant family photos of us.  Another big plus was that the entire event didn't break the bank!

We've since moved to Chicago, and we're still searching for a modern Indian restaurant with an intimate, cozy feel to it.  Clevelanders are lucky to have Chutney Rolls in such a great spot in Little Italy, and we would welcome this restaurant's expansion to include cities like Chicago!"}
{"text":"I would give it a zero if I could. Food was stale at best. Seems like they use frozen stuff and just warm up and put in a frozen bread for you. Had to take a full day of pepto to get my stomach back in shape after eating here. Don't take a chance. There are better places that would serve you fresher food."}
{"text":"Every single time I have come in, the person at the counter has had a smile on their face. They always take my order thoughtfully and make sure it is right. I tell literally everyone I know to check out this place because the food is so tasty and fresh. It is nice to have such an affordable option in the neighborhood. The service is so friendly that it doesn't bother me that it takes a tad longer than I think it will. The owner is always near managing the quality. I cannot recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch and was really happy to see a fast, casual, Indian restaurant in the heart of Little Italy. I parked in the back of the restaurant where there was free parking. The indoor seating area was clean and there were a lot of board games for customers to use. The weather was great so I sat outside where they had 3 tables. 

I ordered (and loved) the mini samosas and murgi tikka (chicken wrap). For those that don't know, samosas are fried savory pastries filled with different foods. The traditional one is filled with potatoes and that was what I ordered. They were fried just right.  Samosas normally come with separate sweet and savory sauces. Their small variation on this is mixing the 2 sauces into one. Brilliant!! What a great idea! On the wrap, the paratha (bread) was flaky and delicious while the meat was perfectly cooked. The chutney (sauce) in the wrap was really flavorful with the right amount of spice. I was later told by the staff that the meat is marinated for 48 hours prior to cooking. It totally shows in the tenderness and flavor of the meat. 

Alec and Dorian were really helpful. Alec took the time to take the big order from my large group and he was really helpful with my friend who had food allergies. He took his time to go over the ingredient list with us which was greatly appreciated. He also helped find something for my kids, who tend to be picky eaters. 

This was my first time going to Chutney Roll but it will not be the last!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple weeks ago on a Friday evening with a friend. We both got the palak paneer, he in a rice bowl and I in the paratha roll. Positives and negatves of the place below:

Positive
- Cheap ($6-7)
- Masala chai was excellent
- Taste was not bad for price (a little too \"fusion-y\" for me, but works for some)

Negative
- For a \"fast food\" place, took a hell of a long time (20 mins +)
- Servers that evening seemed incompetent. They messed up customers' orders, made excuses for their mess-ups, about which customers caused a scene
- Paratha roll was extremely drippy and messy, yet there was no plate served! I had piles of napkins to soak up the stuff
- If you're going to work in an Indian-y restaurant, try to pronounce the items a little bit more correctly. Authenticity goes a long way
- Not much seating, and the chairs/furniture seem rather cheap and uncomfortable.

In summary, it was new and cheap so it was worth a try. As excited as I was about this place, I'd rather pay the extra $4 to get some decent Indian food and I don't anticipate coming back here again."}
{"text":"The food is definitely not your mom's anything.    Both of our meals tasted horrible!!! Idk how on earth this place got gd ratings. The only reason i even gave it one star is coz the inside is cute. All I can say is please please avoid this place at all cost!!!"}
{"text":"The food has gotten significantly better since I was here when it first opened. The staff is helpful and nice. The lunch special - an entree, samosa, and a drink - was really inexpensive and very filling. I had a wrap, and it was large and filling and delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch earlier this week.  I've been wanting to come check them out since trying them at a Yelp event over a year ago, but I just never get to this area of town anymore.  I was so glad I did!  I had their lunch special ($7.99 for an entree, samosa, and drink), which was a good value.  I had a roll with chicken and sweet potatoes, and it was delicious!  Even better than I was expecting.  I would definitely recommend, and would love to eat here again.  

Soooo thankful for their parking lot!  I was not looking forward to trying to figure out where to park in this neighborhood."}
{"text":"New Indian fusion bistro in Little Italy.  Very nice blend of seasonings in the dishes we tried (wraps,rice bowls and salad bowls). I had a blend of sweet potato and chickpeas over rice. Usually Indian food doesn't sit we'll with me but this dish was excellent, and no bad after-effects.  Also had the mango smoothie which was made with real mango and tasted amazing. Well done!"}
{"text":"We got takeout here one night and it was good, but not amazing. I'm definitely looking forward to trying it again and getting a better feel for the place, though, and it's certainly a refreshing change from pizza and bar food in the area.

The girl at the counter was really helpful since I had no idea how to go about ordering anything and directed us really well with a smile on her face (impressive because I'm sure she has to have that same conversation with a lot of customers and it can get old). The mini samosas are delicious little treats, and I could probably make an entire meal out of them. I got a palak paneer roll, which was super tasty and I'd get it again if I knew that the roll wouldn't be quite as soggy as it was that first time. (Yes, it was takeout, but it was a max of 10 minutes before I dug in...maybe that's all it took to get the sog settled in.) I normally don't have texture issues and this wasn't enough to stop me from eating the entire thing since the flavors were great, but I'd prefer less mush on the outside--the spinach mush was expected and delicious. 

Like I said, definitely somewhere I'd like to visit again, as the food is good and I know there's a lot of potential, but I just wasn't entirely wowed."}
{"text":"First time trying Indian fusion and it was great! Had a sweet potato salad and lamb wrap and both were delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great lunch spot! Very friendly staff, great prices, awesome flavors. Overall, one of the best lunch spots on the east side. Best Indian food in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"Tried the chicken tikka wrap at the Botanical Garden Ripe Fest. All I can say is delicious! I'll definitely be visiting the restaurant!"}
{"text":"OMG!! This place is the bombdiggety!
So good! Starting from the baked samosas- whether veg or with lamb.. So good. 
The rolls wrapped in paranthas are so good. 
If you can't decide between the palak or the potato and pea get Half and half. 
Although my favorite is hands down the lamb roll.
Their masala chai is THE best in CLE. 
It's a nice, clean place. Don't miss the photograph on the end wall. Children and kites.:) quintessential India in the spring and summer. 
Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Came here again with my BF for takeout on a weekday. I got the chicken wrap and my BF got the beef wrap (a special on Wednesday). I really liked the wraps, they were better than the rice bowls in my opinion. There was a lot of meat in them too. I loved the flavor of the chicken, and the veggies were really fresh-tasting. The portions were big enough for me, but if you have a big appetite I would recommend getting the maharaji (king) size. We also got a bunch of the mini samosas. We tried each flavor, and I liked them all, but the chicken was probably the best one. I will probably come back again, just because the food is interesting and different and the price is reasonable."}
{"text":"A much-needed Indian gem in the University Circle area! 

I went to Chutney Rolls this past Saturday for a quick dinner and was thoroughly impressed with what they had to offer. So much so that I craved it and came back with a friend for lunch today! I tried the Murgi Tikka wrap and a bite of my friend's Palak Paneer wrap. We both got the mango-ginger lassi as well.

The murgi tikka (chicken) wrap was absolutely delightful. The chicken was tender, juicy, and had the perfect blend of spices. The parantha wrap was warm, flaky, and paired wonderfully with the chicken. It was topped with a mix of cabbage, carrots, and bell peppers, which gave the whole wrap a satisfying \"crunchy\" element.

The mango-ginger lassi was SO GOOD. Actually, it's the best I've had that's not made by my mother! Both the mango and ginger flavors were pleasantly distinct but not overpowering whatsoever. And for those people who don't like overly sweet drinks (like me)...this is perfect for you!

The dining area is bright and modern, complete with an impressive array of card and board games. Great place for lunch, dinner, or a long chat with friends over lassi/chai.

Overall, I recommend this place to everyone wanting some Indian flavor in their lives! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So, A few weeks back my wife and I attended an event here, and we were impressed by this little place near University Circle. The food is a fusion of Indian cuisine with a sort of \"portability\" vibe, as most things are indeed in rolls, wraps, and take out bowls.

But this is not fast food, it's GOOD food. Fresh, tasty, vibrant with a hint of hot and spicey, Chutney Rolls serves up some healthy eats that will keep you coming back:) 

I wish they had a bit more parking, and were bigger cause' I'd love to bring a BUNCH of friends over, but other than that, the place is really good, the management thoughtful, and overall, I'm going to roll back to Chutney Rolls the first chance I get:)"}
{"text":"Horrible service to begin with, they were out of lamb and chicken. Oh wait, they were just lazy and didn't want to make it to order. Waiter asked 'Are you sure you want chicken, it's going to take me like ten minutes'. Really? What kind of service is this? On top of that, you get free food if your order takes longer than seven minutes, and you fill out a time log card (or something of that sort). Telling me it takes 10 minutes to make my food and having a sign that says '7 minutes or you get free food', is quite contradictory. Then there is the mango lassy, which was supposed to be sweet. Unfortunately it left the taste of garlic in my mouth for a few hours. As to why they are putting entire cloves of garlic in their sweet mango lassy is beyond me. The waiter's response was I'm sorry, that's the way it is (with no offer to remake it or offer a refund). And it wasn't only us, we had the entire table try it, and the immediate reaction was seen on each and everyone's face. Finally after about 35 minutes we received our food, and it seemed the few people in their had also been waiting a while (must be the reason why they have board games and a rubik's cube at the tables). Unfortunately I had to wait way to long for a wrap, the size of my palm, that didn't have the filling I wanted because they were either out of the product or were to lazy to make it. While the chicken wrap was mediocre at best, it was the service and experience as a whole that will keep my friends and I far from this place."}
{"text":"OMGosh. On first taste, this place is not bad. It's cheap, its Indian-esque. However, after me and my friends went there on a lunch date, two of the three of us got severe food poisoning. We were sick for an entire week. We think its from their lassi's (maybe the milk had gone bad). 

The food wasn't bad, it was just the aftermath that will keep me from coming back."}
{"text":"Great food tucked away in a little storefront in Little Italy. I had a salad bowl which consisted of cabbage, carrots, red peppers and a black bean/sweet potato mixture. Delicious. Good service and they are open late on weekends and there's delivery service. You can also check them out at the Shaker Square farmer's market. Definitely recommend it for good Indian fusion-like food."}
{"text":"Take 2 on Chutney Rolls! 4.5 this time around. 

I went again because the owner reached out to me. Total 5 on customer service and satisfaction. I think that is one of the most important things - he and his team cares about doing a good job with their business and representing their food well... And of course, making sure the customer is happy! Great small business. I am satisfied. 

Onto the food. I retried the mini samosas. This time, they were prepared better-definitely try the palak paneer. 

For the mains, like everyone said, you pick your \"base\" of a wrap, salad, or rice, and then choose your entree. I had the wrap with the paneer tikka (love paneer... Cheese cubes with onion and pepper) and the rice bowl with phool gobhi (roasted cauliflower). Sadly, they were out of palak paneer. Seems like they sell till they run out so it's better to get in earlier.

The wrap was flaky and delicious, not an American style tortilla wrap for sure. The flavor and spices were good! Just a heads up if you are sensitive to spice. But, happy to know that there are places not willing to compromise on flavor to more accurately represent your cuisine (even tho it's fusion)

The rice bowl was pretty interesting. The rice also had peas in it, topped with the phool gobhi (good) and chopped fresh cabbage. The cabbage was a bit of a surprise but still good because it was fresh. Overall everything was fresh and well prepared. 

We sat outside - they have a few outdoor seats. The inside is small but trendy - good for smaller groups to hang out in. 

Finally, I was pretty full after the wrap and took the rice bowl home. It's a good meal for the price ($5.85-6.15)

Thanks for reaching out, chutney rolls!"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for a while since it's right around the corner from Case. My first impression of this place was that it's similar to Chipotle. You first choose a wrap, rice bowl, or salad bowl. And then, you choose what dish you want in it. Options range from lipta lamb, murgi tikka (chicken), palak paneer (cheese+spinach), and aloo matar (potatoes and peas).

I ordered the lipta lamb rice bowl and was absolutely blown away by the amount of flavor it had! The meat was topped by a savory green sauce (YUM!). The rice had such a variety of spices that it could be a dish all by itself! I tried my friends' murgi tikka and palak paneer rice bowls as well. Both were very flavorful and savory :) I definitely agree with some of the other reviews that the dishes could be spicier. Maybe they can put out some hot sauce by the utensils corner for customers who prefer a spicier flavor?

I also ordered their mango lassi. Can't go wrong with this drink! 

Lastly, I love how they have a \"Hindi lesson of the day\" section on their menu. \"Mujhe Cleveland pasand hai\"=I LOVE CLEVELAND :)

Definitely recommend this restaurant! Great service, food, and atmosphere."}
{"text":"So, the first time I experienced Chutney Rolls was actually at the Shaker Heights farmer's market. I was intrigued. I am a total fiend for Indian food, and I thought it sounded like a pretty neat concept. I then visited the restaurant itself. I enjoy the food, and think it is creative and tasty, but I think the serving sizes are a bit underwhelming for the price. That is probably to be expected, given that it is a new restaurant trying to survive, but you'll need a chunk of change to feel full. I was also a little disappointed in the fact that the paratha was frozen, and I suspect the samosa bites were as well. Listen, I get it, its a new place, trying to make it and trying to get food out quickly. But, I think they could really benefit from making things like that in house. 
In terms of the service, it was pretty quick and helpful, though I haven't seen them in the midst of a dinner rush, so I can't speak to that. The ambiance was neat; board games, outdoor seating, cozy atmosphere. Free parking is definitely a plus. The owner happened to be there while I visited, and mentioned that they will deliver just about anywhere, no matter how far (obviously a delivery charge applies), but I really got the feeling that he will do whatever it takes to make his costumers happy. I think that will really serve them well in the future. I expect good things from this place to come, but hope that they will tweak a few things.

Summary:

PROS: 
-Taste
-Creativity
-Parking
-Very positive attitude from ownership and staff

CONS:
-Frozen components, that could be better (possibly even cheaper) fresh
-Small portion size for price

I would recommend a visit, and I will likely be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome Lipta Lamb rice bowl, masala chai and yogurt chutney . Loved the ambience and the music.

The only complain I have would be the use of Kawan Paratha for the roll."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great weekend lunch here. Tried a rice bowl and lamb wrap. The savory Lassi was VERY good. We'll be back! Note: parking in the rear for non-campus visitors! Give it a try!"}
{"text":"I found the menu to be very limited.  The portions are small as well. I got the chicken roll which was good. However the mini samosas were burnt. Not sure what happened there. This place would definitely be worth more stars if they added to the menu and sauces."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery on 7/26 and it was pretty much a success.

I found that the value for my money was pretty good.

I had the lamb salad, which had a reasonable number of lamb chunks and a healthy dose of cabbage based salad that actually tasted pretty good.

I had two of the mini samosas. The paneer and spinach ones. They were also pretty good, but definitely small.

I also had the Masala Chai, which was actually pretty spicy for a drink. Almost two spicey.

I ordered just enough to avoid a delivery charge. Ordering on the phone wasn't super easy, the young kid who took my order had to ask if they could deliver a drink or if I was in there range or if they had the advertised dessert from the hand out flyer I got at the Shaker Square farmers market. Delivery time from the moment I hung up was about 30 minutes, and I live pretty close.

It comes down to Chutney Rolls being a good value for the cost, and I would recommmend you try them!"}
{"text":"Quick, affordable and delicious! Indian food had always been a \"sometimes food\" for me since it is usually kind of expensive and far away. With this place opening up in my backyard, I'm able to try all sorts of new things. And, they add new specials to the menu all the time, making every visit fresh and exciting!
The staff are incredibly friendly all the time, every time. And the owner is often working the register getting to know the customers.
The wraps are amazing! I'm so sick of people putting food in a tortilla and calling it a wrap. Boring!! The wraps at Chutney Rolls are cooked to order and crisp on the outside and nice and doughy on the inside. They're filled with one of several Indian dishes (veggie, vegan and meat options available) and topped with a delicious cabbage salad and cilantro and tamarind chutneys! Mmmmmm! And if wraps aren't your thing, you can get the food over rice or just with the cabbage.
Finally, they fill out the menu with mini-samosas, lassis and smoothies (and not just mango!) and a bunch of cute, fun soft drinks.
Definitely check this place out if you are in the area and need a quick place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim last week for a lassi drink. Winnie was very helpful since I was having a hard time deciding on which flavor to get. I ended up with Mango. Wow!  the mango lassi was so much better this time. A lot less tarty and the mango flavor was evident. The mango to yogurt ratio was just right!"}
{"text":"Happy Birthday, Chutney Rolls! Indian food -fast, flavorful, and delicious! The Lipta Lamb is my favorite, but I love everything I have tried. Many vegetarian options as well!"}
{"text":"I really am a fan of Chutney Rolls. Not only is a huge portion of their menu vegan friendly, it's run by some genuinely good people. I feel like it's getting harder and harder to find places that truly make you feel welcome when you go in. Nowadays everything is about \"get-in get-out\" service, so it's nice to walk into Chutney Rolls and feel like you're just hanging out at a friends. A friend who cooks really good food. 

The menu can be a little intimidating at first. The Indian verbiage is not for newbies. The first time I went I just straight up asked about pronunciation and they were more than happy to walk me through the menu. Now I look like a pro when I go in.

Ask for samples if you aren't sure about what you want. But be warned: everything is so delicious it's hard to choose.

Typically when I go I almost always end up getting the Shakkar Kand & Chana bowl. I'm a sucker for sweet potatoes. The Shakkar Kand & Chana is tender sweet potatoes and black chick peas, topped with fresh cabbage, lemon dressing, tamarind chutney and fresh cilantro chutney. I'm not kidding when I say this stuff is legen-wait-for-it-dary. Since I usually go for the bowl all of this is laid on top of a bed of rice. You can get it in a couple of different forms though, the most noteworthy being the roll (hence the restaurant's name).

My only complaint is that every once and a while when you go in you end up getting the very end of a batch of rice. I recommend waiting for the next batch to be made since the old rice tends to be a little crunchy and dry. Other than that this place is definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Definitely fast. Definitely delicious. Decently spicy, good flavor, friendly staff. I loved the atmosphere with the modem seating, art, and game collection. We played Connect 4. :) We had the Palak paneer rice bowl and the Murgi Tikka rice bowl. Yum! Great prices too!"}
{"text":"This place was like a hole in the wall. Nice food and quick service. I ordered the potatoes samosa, Palak paneer wrap and aloo matar queso along with masala tea and mango lassi. All the items very really good. Parking can be a bit of problem but other than that, a delightful place!!"}
{"text":"My friend talked up Chutney Rolls for days since we had a trip planned out that way later in the week, needless to say I was so excited when the day came to go there for lunch.  As we walked up we noticed the windows looked dark, and there was a closed sign in the window.  We were sooooo bummed!!  The sign said they were closed for staff training and because they were making some changes.  We pressed our noses the window, suddenly Drew appeared and as we told him about our journey there and our disappointment he invited us in and told us he would whip something up for us.  He was soooo accommodating, set us up our own little table, made us some DELICIOUS wraps, made us more bread since we became obsessed with how delicious it was, and put on some jams.  We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves, the experience, and the food.  So glad Drew was nice enough to go out of his way to make our day!"}
{"text":"Think Indian food served Chipotle style and you understand Chutney Rolls.  You have your choice of having your entree served in a bowl or wrap.  There are a wide variety of vegetarian and non vegetarian items.  They also serve samosas as sides.  I have only had takeout, so I cannot comment on the dining room.  Overall, the food has been well seasoned and fairly prices.  The samosas do seem a bit overpriced but are good.  Overall, would recommend if you crave fast food Indian style."}
{"text":"Good flavor! My husband, who is usually turned off by Indian food, told me I could bring him back :). It could have been a little spicier, but still yummy. For the price there could have been more food. Pass on the mini samosas. The one with sweet potato and black chickpeas was WONDERFUL!!"}
{"text":"This review is really only applicable to chaat night.  The pani puri was great.  My dinner consisted just of two orders of pani puri.  Its hard to find pani puri at restaurants so I couldn't resist two helpings.  It was a little less than 4$ per bowl.  It was a fun event.  The friends that I went with also enjoyed their rolls, bhel, and samosa chat."}
{"text":"What an interesting place to add to Little Italy,  talk about a little diversity.  If you want to spice up your life, I would try Chutney Rolls.  It's a really unique and cozy spot with 4-5 tables inside.  There are games like battle ship and four in a row, what restaurant do you know that you can relax and play some games before your meal.  The worker did a great job explaining all of the dishes I asked about.  Since it was my first time, he was more than happy to let me try out some dishes I was curious about.

The lamb rice bowl was awesome, a little too spicy for me, but full of good flavor and spices.  I ordered an extra piece of bread and was waiting until I realized that they had forgotten about it.  He immediately apologized and offered a refund.  I just wanted the bread so I declined and he made us a new piece.  He was so sorry that he gave us free samosas.  Little bites that are breaded, basically a fried dumpling, which was pretty good as well.  This is definitely a place you can go for a quick bite or even a fun night out for board games.  The price is moderate, like a chipotle and the idea is pretty similar as well.  I would go back to this place and try some of their other dishes and mango lassi!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and wonderful service by Matt! Love the food and the atmosphere. I had a lamb bowl with that yummy flat bread and I tried all the samosas- the potato & pea and the chicken samosas were my favorite. I'm definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place! It's always empty when I walk or drive by.. But that's because it's mostly carry out.
Do I like Indian food? I had no idea until I tried it that I do! I had the rice chicken bowl.. It has an Indian name but I forget it.. It was really good! 
The decor of the place made me laugh.. It's very random. But the service was fast and friendly and I was home with my Indian rice bowl in no time!"}
{"text":"Why I took so long to try Chutney Rolls, I will never know...but I was blown away by the yumminess! 
It wasn't just the juicy lamb and cute little bite size samosas that deserved a fabulous review, but the customer service was top notch! I had never been in before, so I was doing the whole \"stare at the menu and drool\" thing...when who I assumed was the owner? manager? anyhow...he came out and gave me the walk through, suggestions, and chatted up about the adventure I was bringing my Roll on :) (I was headed to a weekend of snowy backpacking, and this was the en-route to the trailhead food!). Fun guy! And passionate about his flavors!
I will definitely be back! There are so many I need to now try. lol

Food = AWESOME.
Do try it. You won't be sad."}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of Indian food but I was pleasantly surprised how many solid options there were! They cater to meat eaters and vegetarians alike at very reasonable prices. Also.. Any time lamb is a meat option, I'm sold."}
{"text":"This is NOT authentic Indian food. I ordered a side of paratha which I am pretty sure was frozen paratha from Indian grocery store. Even the mini samosas tasted like the frozen ones you can easily get in a grocery store. I am upset not only because the food tasted bad but also because I was served frozen food."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Chutney Rolls after always walking by on my walks to Little Italy. I was excited by the idea of an Indian restaurant being so closeby but was sadly disappointed by what I experienced. I ordered the shakkar kand (sweet potato and black eyed peas) over rice. The taste of such a normally delicious Indian dish were masked by a level of spice that made eating it almost impossible. In an effort to assuage my taste buds I looked at the water dispenser but there were no cups. Honestly, I'm almost sad that this can be qualified as Indian food to the public - the taste and flavors so well-loved in Indian food are completely missing. The prices are good but the food is definitely missable."}
{"text":"I went to Chutney Rolls for the first time today, wanting something different and I'm so glad that I did!  I explained to one of the employees their that I had never been their before, and I was their because of someone else's suggestion.  The staff was so friendly their and told me what they liked on the menu and what was popular.  I decided on the spinach samosas, a lamb rice bowl and mint lassai.  I was thrilled to know that the food was cooked to order, and everything was so fresh. I could taste a lot of flavors in everything that I had.  The portion size is very decent for the price that you pay.  If you are looking for something different, and you want to give Indian food a try, I say this is a very good place to try.  I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  Try the Sweet Lassi and Masala Chai and the Samosas and everything else!!  The atmosphere is open and inviting.  Street parking and a small parking lot in the back."}
{"text":"Went back last weekend- and now they were out of lamb! Why oh why?

This time I tried the chicken and the sweet mango lassi. Both were excellent. I also really love the mini samosas there too.

I upped the stars to 4 this time, as now I have tried all the basic ingredients. haha. :)"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a better rating but after coming here again and having its take out for a few times, I still have to give it a three star and here's why.

The food was always flavorful and yummy. Huge portion and all that. I loved it. The second time I visited there, there was no water problem, it was great. However, they still didn't have the lamb bites in the appetizer section. I wonder if they actually have that at all. My impression of this restaurant got worse recently because I had a take out from this place and as I was unwrapping the aluminum foil to expose more of the spicy chicken wraps that i was eating, I saw a giant bug - some sort of ant or fly or something squished in between the wrap and the aluminum foil. Thank god this bug was not mixed in the wrap stuffing, otherwise I would have eaten it and not have noticed it. Sigh this is one of my biggest pet peeves - seeing foreign objects in my food (like hair, rubber band, bugs, etc.). I was a little grossed out. It's hard to keep up the hygiene in summer time but I think they need to be more careful about it."}
{"text":"Chutney Rolls is a nice quick place to grab Indian food for a decent price point. It is hard to find Indian food for $6 in Cleveland and Chutney Rolls makes that happen. I stopped in before a visit to the CMA and enjoyed the food from the comfort of my car. The portions were great for the price and I even had leftovers for a round 2."}
{"text":"Well... I was really excited to see there was a Kati Roll place here in CLE as I've had some great experiences w/Indian street food elsewhere. Unfortunately, it did not live up to expectations. 

The Food: My husband and I are vegetarians and like our Indian food very spicy. Too bad the only additional \"heat\" is the cilantro chutney. The aloo mater wrap was pretty good, but the palak paneer wrap was too salty and COLD! The samosas were also on the cold side. Cold food=never good 

Service: Very slow, which is strange since it seemed to be a re-heat situation, not made to order. Plus it was pretty dead when we arrived. 

Cleanliness: It's definitely got that college dorm room vibe, and by that I mean the place is pretty dirty with overflowing trash cans and sticky un-bussed tables. 

Highlight: Mango Lassi was really good and made a 2 star meal a 3. 

Bottom line: maybe for the kids within walking distance it's worth it, but I will not be venturing there again from Tremont anytime soon."}
{"text":"Quantity is too less. No value for money spent. Compare chipotles rice bowl for 6.50 bucks to this crap. Samosas seems like frozen stuff heated in a microwave. Please up your game chutney rolls. Chicken had a tough texture ( like overcooked). It wasn't juicy."}
{"text":"With a craving for Indian, and a yelp deal, I decided to give Chutney Rolls a try.
I can say I'm glad I had the deal.
The samosas were dry and slightly overcooked, and the curries way too salty.  I did enjoy my bowl with the cabbage salad. It was a nice cooling crunch to offset the saltiness.  I had both the lamb and the beef, and I honestly could not tell the difference between the two. Everything was swimming in that curry!

I hope they take this review as constructive criticism. They are a small, family owned restaurant.  I would like to see them flourish in a very upcoming area."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I found out Chutney Rolls had opened around Little Italy. Kati Roll- ish foods with samosas and lassis ... yes please!! 

This review is a bit late, I went about a month ago- late lunch on a weekday. There were a few students eating and studying in there. It's a cute little place, they have games, a handful of tables, and it's fastfood, so you order up at the counter. I had the savory lassi, tried 1 potato and pees samosa, one spinach and cheese samosa, and the palak roll.

The lassi was pretty delicious! Thick and creamy and kind of had a strong taste of cumin, but was still really good. The samosas were decent, kind of tasted and looked like the medium sized ones you get in a package at the indian store and heat up though. And, the wrap was good, although I thought the palak paneer had way too much salt. I wish they had their \"special wraps\" on the menu all the time. I would much rather have a paneer tikka wrap to a palak paneer one on a daily basis.

I would def go back to try other wraps.. I was also super excited to see Frooti (mangi juice box) in their drink fridge!!! LOVE me some frooti!!!"}
{"text":"Mango lassies are amazing. The waitress Winnie suggested I try a sample and I was instantly hooked. The ambiance of this place is casual with cool board games and I had the beef keema in a rice bowl.  The taste of it was bomb in my mouth. I would defiantly suggest this place for a quick meal."}
