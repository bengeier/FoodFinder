{"text":"Based on the reviews I thought this place was going to be great. I would have gave 1 star but the folks running this place were super friendly and they gave me a free samosa on my way out, and the garlic naan was the best I ever had.  I ordered lamb vindaloo with naan and rice. The rice for 6.99 was MUSH and it tasted like old food in the fridge. The spice in the Vindaloo was delicious, but for 13.99 I got 4 small bites of lamb and a few hard undercooked potatoes."}
{"text":"Have ordered from her regularly, love it. I always get something super spicy and delish, Samosas are always great, and ready when I come to pick it up. 

Ate in one time, probably would not do that again as it is kind of dirty on the inside of the restaurant. 

Family run, always happy service, will continue to eat here until we move out of the area :)"}
{"text":"I'm not the best person to judge an Indian restaurant; I've only just started to appreciate this kind of food.....but I will say that I really liked the veggie pakoras and the butter chicken.  They hit the spot, so I'll definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Our first order from Masala Express was a little disappointing. Just a little. The food was good, but we were hoping it would be better. We ordered three vegetarian dishes, and one of them was really nice, the Mixed Vegetable Curry. We haven't had okra in a while so we ordered the Pan Fried Okra Masala, which had a lot of long green pods fried in a ton of onions, which I kind of liked. Onions dominate this dish, so you need to like them. The lentil dish (Dal Fry) was a bit salty and a bit soupy and kind of boring for all that, but mixed with the abundant rice it was a bit better. The garlic naan bread was really good. (4 stars is rounding up a little bit.)

The dishes are served in clear plastic containers, and the portions are huge. Which is a good deal for $8 or $9. Or maybe 3 of them was too much to split between two people. The plastic tubs are great for leftovers.

The restaurant itself is in a tiny strip mall buried in the suburbs and I imagine they rarely have anyone dine in at their two tables. Aside from some paintings and sculptures of Ganesh, the restaurant itself reminds me of a lunch room in a factory. So, order the delivery. From reading the other posts, apparently the butter chicken is quite nice."}
{"text":"Had a veg thali for lunch and it was quick and delicious. The location was very close to our room at the Aria. Service was also nice with the two gentlemen at the counter who were friendly. I'll have to come back and try more"}
{"text":"Not the best Indian food but ok for Vegas Strip. They don't serve Naan instead give 2 Kulcha. Entrees are too buttery and less tasteful because of min use of Spice."}
{"text":"Note that I am vegetarian and didn't have any of the chicken dishes. I got the veggie Thali. 
Pros: fast, lost of seating and of course the central location. Not many healthy quick options on the strip.
Cons: pretty over priced and the food is just ok. A bit tasteless. Also not many vegan options.
Conclusion: meh."}
{"text":"The is located right at the strip and very accessible. It provides a nice shade, a much needed respite from the Vegas heat. There is a pizza shop too inside the same cover.
I tired the Samosa chat and mango lassi for a quick snack. The lassi tasted good but felt a little watery, nonetheless, was happy to find it in Vegas strip. The samosa chaat was good and spicy but felt like couple of spoonfuls less for the price.
They have thalis and other quick bites too. If you are in the area, give it a try if you are looking for some Indian bites."}
{"text":"Food took more than half an hour to be ready. Plus the naan doesn't look like it. I'm not Indian but I know little about indian food. If you are so hungry dont come here expecting that food will be ready."}
{"text":"Nice 24/7 joint on the strip. Food it's fresh and tasty. I had the pav bhaji, veg Thali. Both were very good. This place is worth a try"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I'm so glad to have stumbled upon it! It's right across from Monte Carlo and open 24 hours!! What could be better! 
I never i expected to find such phenomenal, flavorful Indian food on the strip. Honestly, the pictures don't do this place justice. You need to try their food as soon as possible! It'll more than satisfy your Indian food craving! I'll definitely be back when I'm back in Vegas! I miss the chicken tikka Masala!"}
{"text":"Terrible attitude and customer service . Unresponsive to questions. Will not recommend"}
{"text":"I accidentally came across this place and I'm glad I did. The food here is delicious, and the price makes it even better. Even though the restaurant is new the staff's service was stellar. They were quick and on point and the food was piping hot, as it should be. Every time I visit Vegas, I'll definitely hit this gem up."}
{"text":"Most amazing Indian takeout EVER!
I've tasted dozens of Indian take out joints, and this place wins first place, no competition!
BEST butter chicken on the planet! Spicy vindaloo! Fantastic naan and samosas. Best of all - the veggie pekoras are SO far superior to any others I've ever tried, and the mango chutney/sauce that accompanies is just right.

Masala Express is PERFECT. 

And their prices are reasonable too! Cheaper than most! The staff are always very friendly and easy to work with as well.

I DARE you to find better."}
{"text":"I am so impressed! I didn't actually get to see the interior, but my friend who ordered takeout described it as a fast food type restaurant. The quality of the food was amazing! I had been craving Indian food our entire trip in Vegas because we kept noticing the Masala Express sign near the entrance to Fatburger as we walked back to our hotel. (The restaurant is conveniently located ON THE STRIP! Near M&M and Coca Cola gift stores.)

We ordered 1) butter chicken entree and 1) chana masala entree and both were super delicious! My friend had to have ordered around 10PM (they are open 24 hours) and the food surprisingly still tasted so fresh and was the perfect temperature. The butter chicken had just the right amount of kick to it, and the chana masala paired so perfectly with the warm naan bread. The servings were HUGE! We had plenty of yummy leftovers, so so happy we tried this place out. 

I'm removing one star because I bit into a clove/nut/seed/spice of some sort from the basmati rice. Whatever it was- was hard and I literally heard it crack between my teeth. It was edible but was definitely unpleasant. 

All in all, who would have thought this little Indian Express restaurant would serve the most delicious food & satisfy my Indian craving! Hope this place is still around on our next visit."}
{"text":"I had a take out of biriyani and chicken tikka Masala . It's the worst biriyani have had in my life and make things worse they use Indian lemon pickle with lemon seeds in biriyani which made me puke . The butter nan was puny and it's definitely not nan . Chicken tikka Masala was average . Avoid this place and save your money."}
{"text":"Noticed this place on my way from the Linq to MGM Grand. I was craving Indian while in Vegas so seeing their sign, I knew I had to try it!

It is located on the Strip, there's also a Mexican place, a pizza joint and a don't shop in the same building. 

Ordered the Paneer Butter Masala, and the samosa.  Both were good, although the samosas were a bit dry. What I didn't like are their flimsy, thin plates, I had to ask them 3 times to give me an extra one or a tray so my food doesn't just spill.

If you need a fix of Indian food while you're staying somewhere in the strip, definitely try it out! A few other great things about it are outdoor sitting with mist sprays, and that it's open 24/7."}
{"text":"Great food! Butter chicken is a bit sweet but still super delicious and authentic!"}
{"text":"Do not order food early in the morning. We made that mistake and got stale food. The chutney had turned bitter. Sambar was just reheated. The idly was hard. I have eaten bad Indian food at other places but never thought someone could go wrong with idly-chutney so badly"}
{"text":"Great great food! A great buy when you want something good, fairly priced, and in a great location right in the strip. The verity of different types of food in this plaza makes it great for other people to find exactly what they want or mix it up! Little Vegas gem for sure!"}
{"text":"This evening, we ordered in addition to our usual fare (see below) meat samosas and pakora.  The meat samosas were giant!!  The sauce that goes with it - delicious with a hint of spicy sweetness!  The pakora - so good!  

I have to say the Butter Chicken has to be one of the best I've ever had - the chicken is so soft, you can cut it with your fork.  Delicious sauce - you just want to eat more of it!"}
