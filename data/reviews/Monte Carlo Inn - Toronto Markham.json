{"text":"The hotel overbooked the rooms with 2 queen beds and bumped us to a room with 1 king bed, and didn't apologize or give any remediation. We had specifically reserved with 2 queens beds - it was on the printed reservation and we had called and talked to a representative. We had 3 people. On top of that, the manager charged an extra $10 for the third person per night, saying this was in the hotel contract. He was really unpleasant to deal with. The rooms were clean, the staff level of friendliness is hit or miss, but unfortunately for us, this was not the best experience. If you are to spend this amount, might as well go to a larger chain hotel, that has more consistent levels of service. Total disappointment."}
{"text":"The Monte Carlo Inn is a GREAT VALUE. Clean rooms, friendly staff, free continental breakfast, discount for lunch/dinner at their restaurant, which has AMAZING food!  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"If I could give this hotel 0 stars I would. Don't stay if you are still nursing your infant and utilizing the refrigerator to store your breastmilk. I recently stayed here and used the refrigerator to store my 13 week old son's milk. When we went out during the day, the housekeeper came in to clean the room and for some reason she felt the need to open the refrigerator and not close it. All the milk in the refrigerator was spoiled by the time I returned. When I went to complain at the front desk, a staff member stated \"you could just go into the restaurant and get buy milk.\""}
{"text":"I use to come here regularly, everything was good, price and the services. After a long while, we go back again even thought the price has go up. It was a noisy night there were some type karaoke occasion at 1am. and the room beside us were so loud sound like it were having a party....again 1am!We have to call the front desk few times to deal with it. The only thing that upset me the most, when we come here regularly they always let me check late at 1pm; however, I asked them if I can check out at 1pm this time, he said YES and nothing else. Next morning when I wake up at 12pm, housekeeping knock and I tell her that we check out at 1pm. The front desk calls me right the way said I have to leave now or else they will charge me extra for check out after 12pm. I explain to him the front desk last night said I can check out late, but he just said he don't see any note and tell because I purchase reservation via third party website which I pay less so he cannot guarantee my request.
oh great because I actually pay f*kin higher than your actual price and thank you for ruining my day and tell me all type of sh*t cuz you people have a hopeless management.... Thank you for letting me feel unwelcome and we will never come back to this place."}
{"text":"Called before arriving to get a price on a room for the night with a cot got a price of $119 plus $15 for the cot.  Arrived at hotel and no staff members were present to help us for nearly 10 minutes, when assisted confirmed the price I was given on the phone and booked the room.   Found a toy car and a set of ear buds in the room from a previous customer, never said anything as the room was clean.   When checking out we were told by front desk our room was now $175 and they charged me $20 for the cot.  After explaining that was not the price I agreed to on the phone or when arriving nothing was done to help me out,  Room was paid and we left,   unimpressed will not stay at this location again."}
{"text":"Total randomness that I booked this Inn.

Looks ripe on the outside but rotten on the inside.

I asked the front desk for toothbrush/paste, she told me it can be bought at the vending machine. Really!? Guess what, the vending machine was less than 50% full and WTF! No toothbrush! No Toothpaste! No sanitary pads! Hell no, not all women uses tampons! Just to be clear, none of this was for me but it annoyed me anyhow!

All the light switches were on the lamps itself so you have to go into a dark room to find out how to turn on the dang lights! As I checked out the room, I realized that there wasn't enough towel sets. So I called to ask for more since we booked it for 3 and not 2. I figured that the next couple days they would automatically refresh with 3 sets... NOPE! They really did't want to work for any tips is all I can say. 

Mind you, this is the first time I stayed in a hotel that the front desk/reception did not acknowledge their guests leaving or returning. No hello. No good evening. Nothing! I swear that they were mute!

Don't come here if you want customer service with a smile!!!!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the Monte Carlo Inn - Toronto Markham recently with my parents.  Full disclosure: I booked on Hotwire for $90 a night.  As soon as I found out what hotel it was, I searched for it on Yelp, and seeing all the negative reviews, I prepared myself for an unpleasant experience, but to my surprise, it wasn't so bad.

Front desk staff, while competent and efficient, were not the friendliest, in my opinion.  No smiles whatsoever from any front desk staff the whole time we were there.  Housekeeping staff on the other hand, were much nicer and friendlier.

Our room was pretty standard.  It was clean and a decent size.  The fridge though was tiny, like maybe 1.8 cubic feet max.  The freezer compartment was minuscule.  I'd say it wouldn't even fit one standard ice cube tray.  Something to keep in mind if you plan on buying lots of groceries.  There was a microwave and a coffee maker in the room.  Water pressure was good.  The hallways and elevators were clean.

The free breakfast included with your stay is a continental breakfast buffet and is served in the attached restaurant, La Piazzetta.  The choices were not too exciting to me, but acceptable.  They had white and brown bread, English muffins, bagels, muffins, croissants, lemon danishes, apple danishes, oatmeal, 3 types of cereal, fruit salad (which was comprised of pineapple, oranges, honeydew and cantaloupe only), yogurt, and hard boiled eggs.  You have the choice of upgrading to a hot breakfast for $4.50.  The upgrade gives you 2 eggs any style, your choice of bacon, ham or sausage, and some home fries.  You only get 1 serving of this for $4.50, it's not a buffet.  We stuck with the free buffet.  The food was fresh, (no stale pastries) but I felt it was nothing to write home about.  They have signs up that you must eat your food in the restaurant, you are not allowed to take anything to go during breakfast.  It specifically said that if you take yogurt up to your room you will be charged $2 per yogurt (I guess they had problems with people taking all their yogurt (?)).  

Parking is free and plentiful.  WiFi is also free and fast and reliable.  

Now I realize that all hotels are businesses and at the end of the day they just want to make money, so I don't expect hotel employees to make me feel warm and fuzzy, but I have to say that at this hotel I particularly felt like my stay was strictly a business transaction.  I can't honestly say that I felt welcomed there.  No one was specifically rude or mean to me in any way, I just felt that staff (with the exception of cleaning staff who were nice) were very indifferent towards customers and had a deadpan look on their faces at all times. (Based on other reviews here on Yelp though, I think I lucked out if \"indifferent attitude\" and \"deadpan expression\" are my only complaints about staff, lol).   

So if you want an inexpensive place to stay that's clean, with free breakfast, parking and WiFi, and is conveniently located in Markham and you're not too fussy about customer service, then this hotel is a good fit."}
{"text":"A family wedding brought us to the Monte Carlo Inn for a weekend -- we couldn't wait to leave.

The hotel itself is very outdated, and the rooms were very run down. There were about 50 of us staying at this hotel for the weekend, so I got to see the insides of a bunch of rooms.

My room had an iron that didn't work. The carpet was so gross and the sofa had a funky smell. When we phoned down to get more towels, the people who were working there that weekend were acting as if it was such a bother to drop off towels. When the guy came to the door with 2 towels for us, he was mute and flat. He didn't respond to me, just put out his arms then walked off very annoyed. The customer service here was very spotty, some people were normal but some looked like they were hating life.

If this place is the only accommodation available to book, then do it -- but if you have the option, book elsewhere.

The best part of this place was that their air flow system worked in the room, but it was right next to the bed."}
{"text":"This is the first time I stayed at the Monte Carlo Inn and I am not impressed. Customer service at the front desk was largely lacking. Not friendly at all. 

I made the booking online for 3 people, but when we got there we were told that the third person cost an extra $15/night. I explained to them that when I booked it the price was listed for 3 people but they told me that it was the hotel policy that the listed price is for 2 guests and any extra is at an extra cost, although it was not written on the confirmation. I double checked it to make sure but they insisted. The person at the front desk who we dealt with was not remotely even interested in what I was saying, he wasn't even looking at me when talking. I just find that a little disrespectful. 

I figured since we don't have anything else booked and we were tired from a 6 hour drive, we'll just pay the extra $15 and get it over with. So we ended up paying $134 + $17tax/night which is quite a bit for a place like this... 

The rooms themselves were pretty standard for an inn. It was nice to have microwave in the room, but the fridge was not cold. The bathrooms were pretty standard too, except the faucet was leaking and there was water all over the floor every time we had to use he sink. There were also two silverfish that we had to dispose of in the bathroom. 

Honestly, the only thing that I could appreciate from this Inn are the cleaning staff who were very nice and friendly, and the continental breakfast that is included in the room fee. The waitress/waiter were also very nice and friendly/welcoming. If only the front desk was also like so.... 

Would I stay here again? Probably not... if there are other options."}
{"text":"This was my absolute favorite place to be as a kid.

 I was going to book this place because it is closest to my aunt whom we are visiting. I've had many fond memories here in the jacuzzi, running between my sofa couch and the huge fluffy beds. This has been my favorite hotel in Canada growing up. It's the only one we ever go to. Perfect for a family of three. I never even looked up the rating until today. This place looks nice and all, but customer service really makes or breaks a place.  I'm was surprised it had such low ratings, but the more I read, the more it matched up with the call I got today. 

We called and had to go grab a credit card  from the car. To my surprise, as I checked the house voicemail, there was a two minute long message with customer service saying, \"I don't want to deal with this motherfucker.\" Really though? I'm sure she didn't realize that the phone was still recording because it ran so long, but that was really upsetting to hear. Later on in the call, she calls another potential customer an idiot. I REALLY wanted to like this place and go back again. 

This call was super unprofessional and I hope no one else ever has to experience something like this. The lady who made this call needs to be reprimanded. In no circumstance does any customer deserve to be called that."}
{"text":"The inn is a bit small, but clean common areas.  Front desk staff friendiness, of course, depends on who's at the front desk.  I've experience decent service to borderline rude during my 3 nights stay.  The bathroom is a bit cramp and the toilet paper is install at a place that's really hard to get to when sitting down, so not well thought out.  There were stains on my bedsheet also, even though it's dry stain, it's still gross."}
{"text":"Monte Carlo Inns is a small size inn with free continental breakfast.

Friendly staff and decent size room, with no frills!

The continental breakfast actually was disappointing... some basic pastry, cereal, bread, and fruit."}
{"text":"I love going here.  I have gone here every time in the last 10 years.  They have excellent service at the front desk.  They even delivered the bed and towels that we needed extra.

The room service is not the most bright, if we have 5 ppl and 4 ppl in two rooms and of course that many towels each night, you would think they would replace them with that many but only left us 3 and 2 in each room each night...  We kept having to ask the front desk for them.

Buying stamps here is convenient but expensive, they marked it up 35 cents each plus HST on top of that.

The bathrooms are small and oddly designed but they work for what they are intended for, the annoying thing was our toilet seat kept falling down so as a guy I had to hold it up and go at the same time.. Awkward...

The queen beds we had were very good, lots of pillows and some super fluffy and I think they renovated since last year.  They have brand new LCD tv's and the furniture is all nice and refurbished.

We paid about 120 each night for 5 ppl and 110 each night for 4 people."}
{"text":"omg!!!! the worst of worst hotel! dont ever stay!!! stay away!!! from the very first call i've made in the hotel when i arrived from the airport, and how the front desk monotonically answered the phone, i kinda know its not the friendliest hotel. ive been travelling a lot and the i've stayed in tons of hotel but this is by far the worst of the worst...they said free continental buffet breakfast but theres just boiled egg, yogurt, cheap coffee, and bread...you can't take your breakfast in your room ( because thats their policy) but you can order one in your room for a fee. and the front desk and the buffet attendant (the most arrogant one) is the most unwelcoming person on earth. do yourself a favor, save your money and stay away from here. the very reason why they are offering 10% in your hotel stay here is because their service sucks! if given a chance, ill get my money back and pay more for a better hotel stay! the people here is not hotel people, if they understand that. they should have work somewhere else, maybe in a field where you dont do customer care, some kinda isolated profession where you dont deal with people."}
{"text":"Don't stay at this hotel unless your other option is the street. Terrible service at front desk to start the check in, their mannerisms as though you are bothering them. Go to our room and call for one extra sheet and blanket, they said you already have sheet and blanket on your bed, we are fully booked and said \"you want extra!?\" We persisted, got our extra set and proceed to add that to our bed, and saw a bug crawling(see pic.)
We want to leave this place asap, but was told that they won't honor a refund if we check out now. Gave us their only available room on their second level right above the coffee lounge. Karaoke on that weekend lasted till 1:00am. Needless to say, we didn't have 
a good rest! NEVER coming back!!!"}
{"text":"They gave us the extra bed we asked for after 2.5 hours after check in 

We had to call and ask 3 times. 

The continental breakfast was gross
We ordered omelet and french toast 
They both tasted stale and old"}
{"text":"I don't expect much from a three star hotel. I just never expected to get such terrible customer service. The only reason I booked this hotel was because the deluxe suites have the jacuzzi in the room instead of in the bathroom. I checked in with my girlfriend and as we walked toward the lobby I got the most disgusted and dirty looks by the employees. The only reason why this place isn't getting a one star rating is because the room was still pleasant. I just can't stand when employees offer the worst service. Whether you have a bad day or not a job is a job. Not even a smile."}
{"text":"The outside looks clean but when you enter your standard room, ughhhh!!!!  Terrible bed, bedding/linen, towels, funky smell, just an overall Motel 6 or Extended Stay quality, 2 Star at best.  There are better 3 Stars hotels in this part of town like the Courtyard, Residence Inn or even the Delta Markham.  My advice, skip this place altogether, I hate dirty motels, you never know what you might catch to save a few bucks.  Last point WI Fi is free but it's like dialed up, very spotty and slow as snail.  Only decent thing I can find, their upgraded suites are ok, much newer but they charge extra, making it on par w/ the better 3 Stars mentioned above, so why bothered?"}
