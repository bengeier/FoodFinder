{"text":"Great service! Audrey (or Aubrey, couldn't catch it clearly) was a great help to me and my loud Asian family. She was very accommodating and didn't bat an eye at the numerous requests we had to make due to some diet restrictions. The rest of the staff was very friendly and I was very thankful that they were willing to help out some excited tourists!"}
{"text":"Slow service, food was good.  Kinda expensive but good food."}
{"text":"The escargots were AMAZING, we ordered 3 plates amd wanted more, melted cheese on top OMG gave my mouth a mini orgasm. They don't have alcohol but go the grocery store across the street and grab a bottle of rouge for $20 and devoure the steak tartare. Great experience, 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food is good. I went with a group of 5 people. We each had something different and we all cleaned our plates. I especially would recommend the salmon which was delicious and cooked to perfection, however, I'd ask for a different side sauce, the white sauce I received looked and tasted quite odd. I would not recommend that.  The onion soup was sweet, salty and cheesy. Very good.   My only complaint is that the service was definitely lacking. We were one of 3 tables at the restaurant and had to ask for bread after 20 minutes. No one came to check on us when we arrived, mid way or at the end. We had to flag down our waitress 3 times, once to ask for bread, none was ever offered to us, to ask for coffee and finally the bill and the restaurant was nearly empty.   All in all great food, good ambiance and lacking service but didn't ruin our night."}
{"text":"Tartare correct et bon service, mais la facture salée ! 30$ un tartare boeuf/frite cela fait chère le 150gr de viande et de frite congeler. Dommage car bonne ambiance, mais un prix comme cela je préfère le dépenser dans un restaurant plus haute gamme et en amoureux."}
{"text":"The food here was pretty decent.  Unfortunately it was nothing to write home about.  The prices are a bit high - and they don't serve alcohol - it's BYOB."}
{"text":"Ce restaurant est un ancien Steak-Frites St-Paul, mais depuis qu'il a changé d'administration et de raison sociale, je dois dire que c'est bien loin de ce que c'était. A preuve, lors des festivités de la fierté à Montréal, les tables n'étaient meme pas toutes occupées, ce qui est incomparable à ce que c'était avant le changement. Le service est ordinaire, la nourriture est ordinaire. C'est cher pou ce qu'on vous offre. Pour le prix, vous pouvez manger bien mieux ailleurs à Montréal, à tout le moins, allez dans un VRAI  Steak Frites St Paul. Je suis déçu car c'est un endroit que j'aimais bien dans le Village."}
{"text":"While walking down St Catherine's searching for a place to dine late, we followed a crowd into this restaurant. We were immediately greeted and seated at a small table in clear view of the kitchen and all the dishes that came out looked delicious, especially the calamari. The price for entrees seemed pricey at first but we were surprised with a house salad and fresh baked rolls, as well as two hearty side dishes. My salmon was a bit over cooked but otherwise tasty and no alcohol served here so you must bring your own wine. The Excellent wait staff did have a bottle opener on hand."}
{"text":"L'ancien Steak Frites Saint-Paul n'est plus. Cet ersatz le remplace et les clients ne gagnent pas au change. Le rapport qualité/prix est nettement moins intéressant qu'avant."}
{"text":"The service was very slow.  There was only one waiter on duty for the whole restaurant.  In addition it was very expensive.  This is a bad combination.  I would never go here again and recommend that you go elsewhere especially when there are so many other steakhouse to choose from."}
{"text":"On y allait pour la qualité  de la viande mais dernièrement j'ai eu un confit de canard qui était difficile  à mastiquer et la semaine  dernière  un tartare  saumon qui baignait dans l'huile.les steaks de portions inégal.  Pas d'acceui l dutout deux personnes qui te regardent sans bonjour ni rien. On en perd"}
{"text":"I have mix feeling about this place. I don't really eat meat, I usually end up going here for someone's birthday or holiday party. I usually get the salmon tartare. It is fine, not mind blowing or anything. the service is great though. The waiters and waitresses are very accommodating. It is bring your own wine which get an extra star in my booked."}
{"text":"Way Overpriced for the food they serve, steak looks like a sample piece, and the fries are over cook stay away don't believe is good because is crowded we made that mistake"}
{"text":"Malgré des serveurs adorables, efficaces et à l'écoute des clients; le contenu des assiettes ne suit pas:  Tartare de saumon gâché par le côté pimenté, on perd toutes les saveurs du poisson. Assaisonnement à revoir. Saumon grillé correct et frais mais les frites sont molles et détrempées d'huile, les haricots verts sont simplement décongelés en étant bouillis et sans sauce. La sauce salade et saumon est sucrée! Quel dommage"}
