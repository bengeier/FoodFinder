{"text":"We have been here several times and the pizza is awesome! We ordered the buffalo chicken, the Tuscan chicken, and have sampled the wings as well. Don't let the negative reviews fools you - his place has great pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I've had the subs 4 times with my family and everybody loved them so I would recommend everyone give them a try!"}
{"text":"I don't know why I keep running into bad luck with pizza shops in Pittsburgh, but it's really disheartening.  Pizza Romano usually has a decent veggie sub that I order when my husband is craving wings and pizza.  Apparently though, this time that we ordered, they failed to tell us that their menu had changed.  Instead of a medley of vegetables, they gave me goopy \"eggplant\", soggy tomato, cheese, and some type of liquid that had made bread into soup.  I wouldn't even attempt to eat it.  I called and THEN they notified me of the change.  No big deal... but their new menu stated that there should be eggplant, tomato, zuchinni, and mushrooms on it.  I saw no mushrooms or zuchinni. Also their garlic bread was weak and disgusting and tiny.  Not worth it.  I am really disappointed with our experience. Needless to say, we won't be ordering from there again.  I just hope we can find a restaurant that can provide quality when we're craving some delivery."}
{"text":"The delivery guy was really rude when he showed up and provided over all poor customer service.  The pizza was horrible sauce running off .  I asked for extra cheese and its like they put stew sauce. Whatever was in the little clear cup was spilled and made the pizza soggy.  Overall I wouldn't recommend unless you want soggy wrong orders with horrible customer service"}
{"text":"Just ordered the Mediterranean Hoagie + Eggplant Parm Hoagie last night and had it delivered at 1AM. Not only were they delicious and huge (saved half for lunch the next day), but they were one of the only places open in Pittsburgh who actually delivers past midnight. And they have a huge vegetarian selection. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ordered food over an hour and a half ago. Called 30 mins ago, said it would be here in 20 and still not here. They've lost my business and I will definitely spread the word to all my neighbors."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Oakland- more expensive than other places but definitely worth the extra money! I also love the garlic butter they give you with the pizza.....YUM!"}
{"text":"Placed order and never delivered. Waited 2.5 hours and Pizza Romano stopped answering the phone? Sometimes, could hear girls talking on other end, unaware that they had answered.   Only successful because it's in a city; terrible business and quality."}
{"text":"Despite the bad reviews I read, I decided to go ahead and give this place a try.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed!  The pizza has a sauce that is irresistible and the dough is lighter than a layer of fillo dough.  The steak hoagie could have done better with some more cheese, but I'm not complaining!"}
{"text":"Inexpensive if you get the calzone or oven baked sub. The gyros sub is made with lamb and beef, and the bread is freshly baked. Even the salad was fresh, and a lot. The chicken calzone was delicious with what appeared to be freshly made mozzarella. Very clean restaurant and the cashier was very friendly and helpful. This place isn't very big, with seating for maybe 30 people. Will be coming back, hopefully it doesn't get crowded, but this place won't go unnoticed. Great experience."}
{"text":"Before I say anything, I would just like to point out that I created a Yelp account specifically to write this review.   I waited over 25 minutes for ONE slice of pizza.. In person (Not delivery!!!). Although I waited patiently and was extremely courteous to the woman who took my order, I experienced horrendous customer service. The guy who eventually gave me my slice of (mediocre AT BEST) pizza was extremely rude and in fact, did not want to give me the slice because I did not have a receipt (woman who took my order did not give me a receipt). After I convinced him that I had already paid he gave me my lousy slice of pizza and was not apologetic in the slightest.   The only good thing about this place is its location (Right off of Forbes Ave on Pitt's campus). Mediocre food combined with terrible customer service certainly does not make for a good business model.   If you're looking for decent pizza in Oakland, I suggest Antoon's or Sorrento's."}
{"text":"Would rate at -2 stars if possible. Encountered an aggressively rude pizza driver for this establishment while attempting to park in front of their store. Never made it into the store to order a dozen pizzas for my event, which in retrospect after reading the reviews, was an excellent disruption. Clearly their driver saved me from another bad experience."}
{"text":"I give it four stars because I haven't tried all the good!! This New York style pizza is so good  Pizza is super cheesy and not too saucy which is a good thing. Prices are decent.. omg they have the biggest, moist brownie ever!!! YES.  Looking forward to making this our new pizza joint!"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a great bit during my last four years here at Pitt, so I was as bit disappointed when one day I got triple charged by Pizza Romano when a new employee started working there.  The manager, however, was quick and kind to resolve the issue when I brought it up and showed them the mistake that was made (and proof of the messed up transactions).   This has been my go to pizza spot over the last four years, so I'm glad I got high quality customer service on top of great pizza."}
{"text":"Just had our first experience with delivery, it was great! The young man who took my order was very friendly, the delivery guy called when he was on his way, and the food was really good!!! A little bit pricey but my husband love his meatzza pizza and my pecan salad was wonderful. The staff really won me over though. Good people make for a good experience :)    What happened??? Terrible tonight! Took 70 minutes, everything was cold, salad was bad!! The lettuce was dirty and barely chopped - talking giant inedible pieces of lettuce. $35 down the drain."}
{"text":"Just tried it for the first time last week not bad but in my opinion a little pricey for the pie."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery tonight.   Got a coupon in the mail and thought we would try it out.  $16 for a large 14\" two topping and 10 Wings.  Our total was $20.35 with delivery plus tip.  I am giving 3 stars because it was just average.  The one complaint I have is that the toppings on the pizza seem to be lacking.  2-3 pieces of each topping on the piece of pie which seems scarce for a topping such as pineapple.     Wings were okay.  A little on the soggy side for boneless but I'm sure that's from the delivery.  We got the Honey-Hot.  They were not too hot though....  I agree with one of the Yelpers that the crust was a little tough to chew, but not bad tasting.  The people on the phone accepting the ordering and delivery driver were very professional and nice.  I'd recommend everyone try it out, but i am sticking with our \"go to\" Venezia's for now until this place grabs hold on the market and improves a bit."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. Doing 4 stars for now because we've only been there once for a pepperoni pizza. Looking forward to going back and exploring the menu more!"}
{"text":"Purchased pizza for the employees and everybody liked it.  Fresh and tasty.  I forgot my coupon but the cashier was very helpful and made my trip worth it.  We'll be back for another try."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Competent pizza shop food at pretty reasonable prices.  The pizza itself is based on a doughy, bready, soft crust complimented by tangy, herby pizza sauce. The cheese is salty and the good kind of rubbery. It reminds me of Little Caesar's almost, but with decidedly better ingredients. It's a big improvement from nearby Antoon's or Sorrento's. Any fare based off these ingredients works well. In particular, their cheesy breadsticks are absolutely delicious and are my go-to option when in the mood for carb laden food.  The other stuff on the menu, such as hoagies, wings, and sides, is done pretty decently. Their buffalo sauce in particular isn't strictly a buffalo sauce, but it's tangy, spicy, and bold. As such, their buffalo chicken hoagie is one of my favorites in Oakland. Additionally, both their standard variety fries and buffalo fries are crispy, well-seasoned, and flavorful. Killer student specials cut prices significantly, so Romano isn't too tough on the wallet.  This isn't destination eating, but if you're nearby it's worth a try."}
{"text":"This spot reminds me of the place I used to get pizza in college only even more delicious.  The sauce is both sweet and rich at the same time, it hits you with a blast of yum!   The topping are of excellent quality. I'm a big fan of bacon pineapple pizza (not Canadian bacon). The bacon is not too greasy and the pineapple is not watery, the balance of the pie is just right.  And the crust... They offer many options. All of them strike a great balance between light, crispy, hearty and chewy. They make great pizza.  Lastly, they offer promotions. $5 one topping large pies for carry out. They have a two topping coupon on the boxes, just ask for it - $6.99.  What are you still reading for? You could be eating pizza!"}
{"text":"this place is now closed :(  their pizza bread sandwiches were the best! service not so great...very slow."}
{"text":"Loving this little pizza joint! It's small, clean and an affordable week night dinner. Their staff is friendly and they have a great variety of toppings. I love that they have chicken fingers, burgers and other items for the non pizza eaters (do any exist?). Don't go in with the expectations of the most gourmet pizza ever but do go hungry and ready for a decent budget pie! Will keep giving them my business as long as they keep up the service, specials, quality and cleanliness! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Canceled order while it said it was en route for delivery. Do not use this place for delivery. Food is subpar at best."}
{"text":"Ordered hamburger and sub sandwich. Both were so greasy and the bun was soggy. My husband was not able to pick up his burger because it was soggy so called to complain. Said they would send another one over. After 40 minutes called to see where it was. They said it was out for delivery. It has been well over an hour and still not here. We live right down the block. Finally arrived and still the bun was soggy and the hamburger was dry. Will never order from there again."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff, cooks taking trash out, and over an 80 minute wait for french fries. Pizza Romano takes advantage of its customers and uber eats drivers. Oakland has MANY other quality pizza places with much nicer staff who actually cares."}
{"text":"Called late night from work, 3  hungry nurses...I asked the pleasant- sounding guy if the steak calzone was big enough for two to share...he replies, \"It's really big,  I can't usually finish half and I'm a pretty big guy.\"  So I ordered it with confidence...asking for sauce on the side...along with breaded mushrooms and zucchini.  Imagine my surprise when the delivery guy hands me a small (10\") pizza box...that's how small the calzone was, it didn't fill the box...no side of sauce...zucchini was very greasy and not crisp at all, very little flavor, mushrooms were \"good\" per the nurse that ordered them (I wasn't impressed, but then I never order fried mushrooms).  I called them just to say how small the calzone was and two nurses who are working all night had to share the tiny calzone..with no sauce...I said it's our first time ordering and it would probably be the last...I got, \"that's understandable, sorry about that.\"  The steak calzone tasted ok, but didn't have a lot of filling, alot of crust with not enough topping.  Too many choices in Oakland to waste $26.74 (30.00 with tip!) on this place that obviously doesn't care about retaining  new customers (we nurses talk, too! Word of mouth goes a long way in the hospital!)"}
{"text":"Delicious and fast delivery! Only took 25 minutes to deliver. We ordered the breadsticks, breaded zucchini, and buffalo chicken tenders. The chicken tenders had just the right amount of spice and were very crispy. The breadsticks are huge and came with 10 which was great for the price! Made our night in very tasty:)"}
{"text":"Great Service and Amaizing Buffalo Chicken Sub, those fries were good! Would definitely come back specially since food is great and prices are pretty good too."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery, never came. Called restaurant and the man told me I had ordered it for pick up. I didn't but ok I asked him to send it please. Three hours later I called back and he told me first that it had been picked up in store. Wrong. Told me a completely different order twice before finding my order from 4 hours earlier and insisted for the second time it would take a half hour. Don't order from here unless you want to argue with a man who keeps calling you \"honey\"."}
{"text":"Very fast service! The pizza slices were great!!! We ordered from Uber eats. They food was still warm. The buffalo chicken fries were great. The portion sizes are more than amazing! Keep it up Pizza Romano!"}
{"text":"Had sandwich,  calzone,  and fries delivered.   Arrived late and cold.  Food didn't tast spectacular so wont be ordering again."}
{"text":"This place has the best Baked Subs ,Hamburger and  Calzones..Friendly staff be prepared everything is freshly made to order.. We will be back.."}
{"text":"They have THE best Chicken Alfredo (with mushrooms, of course).  I never really liked pizza until I had their Margarita pizza.  Atmosphere is very casual.  I prefer to pick up and eat at home. Coupons usually are available in the weekly mailer ads. I have forgotten mine on occasion and they are nice enough to give me the discount anyway."}
{"text":"What happened to my favorite pizza place!!! I called for my usual delivery to find out they don't deliver anymore. Because I love the food so much I pay a large mark up thru door dash. I get my usual chicken bacon ranch pizza and traditional garlic Parmesan wings. What I got was gross breaded chicken on the pizza instead of grilled and gross breaded boneless wings instead of traditional. My family just couldn't even eat it. I miss my favorite place and hope they go back to the good stuff we loved. If they do I'll most definitely update this review."}
{"text":"I ordered from here through DoorDash during Super Bowl weekend and it was my first time trying it, I was impressed! The pizza was delicious and I especially loved the crust and size of the pizza. I had the wings and I loved them. Super fast delivery and the pizza was delicious and fresh, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Definitely affordable and i will return for more."}
{"text":"Went in today at 11 three people working got the slice and a drink and a gyro burger. It took 50 mins to get alive and burger when they only said it would be 20 mins. Then they did not have the Greek dressing  the burger was so greasy  i think I drive a little further next time to the other pizza place"}
{"text":"Try the subs.  Seriously.  You won't regret it.  Have ordered 3 times for delivery. Even french fries arrive hot and crispy!  Great ranch dressing.  The ceasar pizza is shockingly good!  Wings could be cooked more for a crispier skin. Bacon ranch fries could be better - cheese was not melted enough and not enough of it. Toppings were just kinda plopped on.  Overall, fantastic because before now, only Pizza hut and dominos delivered to us. This will be our new regular pizza place for sure.   I'm not joking about the subs. They are fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Worst buffalo chicken pizza I have ever had in my life. Biggest waste of money EVER smh. I ate half a slice of burnt pizza with dried up hard cheese and \"chicken\" that didn't even look like chicken and threw an entire medium pizza in the trash that cost 18$. There was no sauce at all. This place is a joke. Had to order pizza from another place. Don't bother wasting your money here. AND delivery took an hour. I will be making sure none of my friends go here anymore. Don't wanna support this business. Hope it shuts down and a better pizza place opens up instead."}
{"text":"Worst service I've ever seen, employee working was rude and unhelpful. It's a shame because I rarely write bad reviews but wow, pittsburgh is usually a great town.. If you can avoid it, don't go here."}
{"text":"Sorry I have to be honest. First time trying this place. We ordered the Supremo and were told twenty minutes. We were there to pick up in 15 minutes and pizza was barely warm. This pizza reminds us of frozen pizza. Crust was like cardboard. Very dissatisfied with the quality. Ingredients are not top shelf. Sad it did not live up to expectations. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Soooo good. I love the Greek fries and the philly steak fries. Pretty inexpensive too for such good food. Pizza is better than others in this price range."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok, their \"over baked \" sandwiches that have pizza dough as bread is gross Do Not Get it. It's like crappy half burnt pizza dough with a gob of soggy cheese in the middle with a few pieces of whatever meat you ordered. Salads are a surprise almost gave this 3 but the way the sandwich I got smelled this is an easy 2 nothing more"}
{"text":"We tried the 14\" pizza and 10 wings using a coupon we received in the mail. The pizza was very good with reasonable  amount of toppings and a crust that had a great flavor, but a little under cooked on the bottom. The wings were good, but not the deep fried crispy kind we prefer. The shop is small, with limited seating but very clean. We plan to try the sandwiches next, but will probably make this our new pizza place."}
{"text":"Their spaghetti and meatballs gave me the sh!t$.  Enough said.   P.S. The delivery guy stunk. He pretended like he couldn't speak English and could not come up to my hotel room. I met him on the street outside the hotel and discovered that he forgot one of my sodas that I ordered. I had to send him away with instructions to get me my soda.  I also explained to him how to deliver to a hotel room, which he did on his second trip.  Altogether laughable customer service."}
{"text":"First time customer to this place the pizza is good but one by the time I got home and checked my change they didn't give me the correct change back so I'm kind of bummed out I don't think I will go back!, don't like dishonesty"}
{"text":"First time coming by, ordered 4 slices of cheese pizza and have to say really disappointed. The cheese on 3 of them was burn, all had little to no real flavor.   Service was decent  Price wasn't terrible.  I don't know that I would return willingly."}
{"text":"I wish there was a way to leave 0 stars. If your not a drunk college student, don't bother looking twice at this place. This is the first review I've ever written on yelp but I felt I would help out anyone one else not wanting to waste their money or taste buds. Pizza is bland, over cooked and lacks everything a real pizza should taste like. NEVER ORDER FROM HERE!"}
{"text":"While walking back to work from Spice Island one day, I made a mental note to try more pizza places in Oakland. First on the list - Pizza Romano.  I walked in around 11:10 and was one of their first customers. I saw them rolling out the dough for my XL pie, which is definitely a good sign. The pizza came out fresh and piping hot, and continued to be hot even after I carried it all the way back to work. I mention this because I have an undying love for cold pizza, but Pizza Romano is a dish best served fresh out of the oven.  Here is the breakdown: Crust - texture was kind of blah and uninspired, but the dough was extremely wholesome - like eating a roll or something - and definitely tasted pretty fresh. Not crisp or chewy enough for me though. Cheese - best part of the pizza for sure. Lots of cheese, very chewy and stretchy, like one of those lame commercials where a family is sitting around the table on a Friday night instead of the reality that they are sitting in a living room watching awful TV while the parents get wasted on wine coolers and Canadian blended whiskey. However, the cheese quality slowly declined as the temperature of the slice went down, and I would describe this pizza as one that would be much less tasty when cold or leftover. Sauce - eh. It was red, some tomato flavor, some spices, but nothing that knocks my socks off. Price - ten bucks for a fresh-out-of-the-oven 18 inch, can't complain about that.   Overall, this pizza was average. It would probably be best if eaten in the restaurant, but there isn't a whole lot to look at in the restaurant (no TVs, no bars, no other patrons) so make sure if you order it that your final destination is close. I would recommend Milanos over Romano if you're looking for a delicious and budget-conscious slice in Oakland."}
{"text":"This place has hands down the best pepperoni rolls I have had in my life. Sure it's a college town drunk food place but five stars for the amazing pepperoni rolls. The subs are toasted and pretty good too."}
{"text":"The quality of pizza here is on par with any of the other joints in the Oakland area such as Sorrento's or Antoon's. The prices are slightly higher, but it seems the pies here are made to order rather than being premade."}
{"text":"**CLOSED I drove by today and their signs have been taken down, lights were off, doors locked and number has been disconnected.   This is a nice little neighborhood joint. It's pretty much just carry out but they do have about 8 tables. The sandwiches are really good! My favorite two are the Philly Cheese Steak and the Deluxe Italian. The fries are really good too. I'm looking forward to trying more sandwiches their menu!"}
{"text":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE! they 100% of the time mess up the order, regardless if it's 1 item you're ordering or 5. I guarantee you they will not get one item correct. They won't refund your money when they make a mistake nor will the fix the mistake by cooking the item again. The pizza/calzone/breadsticks are NEVER cooked thoroughly."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Arizona! Very clean restaurant and so many options to chose from the menu. It's the perfect place to go out and eat, or even have the food delivered right to your front door!"}
{"text":"Pizza was delicious. The crust was so tasty.Gyro sub was mediocre according to my husband however he is extremely picky when it comes to Gyros. We will definitely order pizza from here again and maybe try a different sub next time."}
{"text":"Got laughed at by the employees in the back waiting to pick up an order. My appearance isn't relevant to a social situation, especially given a bunch of bros that I don't know. I will not pick up orders here any longer. Disgusting,"}
{"text":"Up from Tucson visiting and this happened to be close by where we were. Must say it was really good pizza. Good flavor and cooked well. Got a salad too and it was big enough for two people. Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"i have so many bad experience with this restaurant. today, it took an hour to get my food delivered. one of them was oreo cheesecake. it was shattered--looked like someone dropped on the floor. and the person on the phone at the restaurant don't know how to handle this situation. when the customer says something is wrong with what they have received, you need to apologize.  i will never ever going to order from this restaurant again."}
{"text":"I got the cheeseburger sub and it was really good, the girlfriend tried it and loved it. She got a cheese pizza and that was pretty good also. Will be going back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Really great pizza and food. Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because it's pricey and a little skimpy on the pizza toppings."}
{"text":"We received a coupon in the mail and figured we'd give it a try. We are pizza lovers but have gotten burned it in the chain pizza delivery restaurants. We were hoping for something different. This place is awesome. We ordered delivery and it all came nice and hot. We ordered a pizza and a calzone. They both were excellent. We loved the flavor and chew of the crust. We are looking forward to trying the cheesesteaks. We will definitely be repeat customers!!!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time at least once a week, today the food was not like it usually is but I don't think I will be back ever again. My lasagna came out cold at first then it came back in edible, 45$ and it was a big disappointment"}
{"text":"I order from then on grubhub alot. The bbq pizza with pineapple puts all other local bbq pizzas to shame. You should try it."}
{"text":"I love their pizza! Can be a little pricey but I have yet to be disappointed! Their garlic butter sauce is to die for"}
