{"text":"I went for Winterlicious on a Friday at lunch. The atmosphere was nice and the service was pretty good. Here's what I had: 

Starter: Butternut squash soup - It was okay but was served lukewarm and tasted like it was sweetened. If it was warmer and a little less sweet it would have been great.

Main: Sweet Chili Chicken - was pretty good. The chicken was very crispy and not overly sweet but there was no heat. The vegetables were good but overly sweet. Maybe I should have had a little of both in each bite. The shrimp chips were bland.

Dessert: Pavlova + lemon curd - I enjoyed this the most, and I'm not overly excited by dessert. The lemon curd with citrus salad (blueberry & tangerine) was amazing and the sugary pavlova was perfect with it.

And to drink, I tried the \"Raspberry Balsamico\" mocktail. It was like a spicy sour patch kid! And I liked it! It's a very small drink but it packs a lot of flavour and it was a fun experience. I recommend giving it a try.

Overall the experience was fun. The good: I thought $15 for this Prix Fix was pretty good value and I would try Origin North again, for dinner - for the atmosphere and full menu which looks interesting."}
{"text":"Winterlicious 2016

It's sometimes refreshing to realize how crucial service is to your overall dining experience at a restaurant. Unfortunately at Origin North, the service was so bad it was actually amusing.

Some highlights:
- Waited 15 minutes for the menu 
- Food tends to sit in the pass for about 5+ minutes before it is delivered (open kitchen, I timed it) which results in everything being cold
- Our appetizers were delivered to a group who still had menus out and haven't ordered 

They also charge for hot water.

A lot of room for improvement. Food was okay but the overall poor experience I had makes it quite difficult to recommend Origin North."}
{"text":"My local watering hole...Live next door and love the friendly staff ! Tuna salad and the origin burger is a must !"}
{"text":"We were a group of ten celebrating a friend's special birthday. Unfortunately, the restaurant did not delivered. The entire meal lasted for four hours - which is way too long. The service was extremely slow and inattentive. Because of the slow service, we were late for the next event. At one point, we waited over 30 minutes for the main course. (We had previously ordered a set menu) There was no update from the server. Glasses were not refilled with water or wine for a long stretch of time. The manager was aware of the delay, she never came and apologized. She took $45 off the bill (It was almost $1000) after we complained at the end of the evening. For an 'upscale' restaurant, it was a very disappointing experience. Toronto has a very competitive food scene. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Overpriced and small portions.

Went there for lunch in between a wedding ceremony and reception.  $17 for the Origin burger.  Came with a small bowl of salad straight from a box with an almost inedible dressing.  Dressing was so acidic it made my face pucker with each mouthful.  Burger was small and the patty was likely frozen.

Service was mediocre at best as the waitress messed up some of our orders and bills.  Worst part is she auto-gratuitied us 18.5% for a large group.

Terrible.  Will not go again."}
{"text":"Went for brunch with a party of 15 which was reserved in advance. Liked the decor and ambiance, but the service was not so great. A few of us ordered coffee and asked for spoons to stir the sugar & cream. Waited for spoons for a good 15 minutes, we were given straws to use in the coffee. The server's were all over the place and very disorganized and everything took long to come to the table. The mimosa's tasted like flat out orange juice and the food was just meh for the price. Nothing special."}
{"text":"I went to Origin North back in later April of this year with a friend for brunch on a Saturday. We both had the FRENCH TOAST + duck confit + blueberry + sour cream + hoisin + sesame and it was delicious!! I was unsure about how the duck confit would taste as I had never tasted duck before, but it was really tasty and went well with the blueberry as weird as it sounds as well as the sour cream. Just a heads up that the portion was pretty big but we both finished them as they were too delicious to not totally finish! I would highly suggest a visit to Origin North especially for their brunch options! During Summerlicious, I also went with my mom for lunch and it was quite delicious then too but definitely the brunch was more memorable!"}
{"text":"If the restaurant does not want to Winterlicious then it should not participate, rather than telling customers that no Winterlicious only when confirmating reservation!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give 2.5 . Been to origin downtown and loved it.... this place is quite different. Went at 7 pm on a Thursday First the atmosphere, The place is beautifully decorated but massive, and even though the place was empty they sat 3 of us at a cramped table practically on top of the serving station that was clearly meant for two and meant for last resort situations, we kept having to move our chairs for servers to get by. Now the service, the service was bad . Not glaringly bad but just awkward. we could tell our server felt very uncomfortable even embarrassed doing her job. We kept trying to think if we had done anything to offend her. She was over the top chipper in a very fake way like she wanted us to know she didn't want to be there. She kept checking on a table near us was standing chatting and laughing with them while pretty much ignoring our empty glasses and closed menus.  She also asked us to repeat our orders and the exact order we wanted them in and she practically cross examined us about it in a very cheeky, trying to call us out kind of way. It was strange and confusing and left us all scratching our heads.  After that we didn't see her all night,  until my boyfriend was filling out the tip portion of the cheque and she came to thank us. Another waitress or another host brought us our meal and drinks.  We got the hummus as an app which was delicious, a beef salad which was just ok and a kale salad which was great but overdressed. For mains our risotto was very tasty and same with the burger but my brother did not enjoy his main which was fish tacos.  Overall the food = good but not great, the service= weird."}
{"text":"July 14, 2014

A friend and I went to summerlicious today. We were so excited because the menu sounded very interesting on the Toronto.com website! When we got there we discovered that the menu had been changed from what was posted on the website! We had really been looking forward to ordering the steak frites and cinnamon sticky buns but neither of the items were on the actual menu. It was very disappointing. The worst part of it though was the nonchalant, unapologetic, approach the staff and the manager took to the situation. The manager was very cold, disingenuous, and rude in her explanation about why the menu had been inaccurate.

We asked to order off the regular menu, as I know there are some delicious items on there. Guess what...their regular menu is unavailable during summerlicious...how ridiculous is that?!?! Why would they limit people like that?? 

Anyway, not sure why, but we decided to stay despite all the mishaps and annoying service. 

The food was sooooo forgettable. I would expect more from a Claudio Aprile restaurant. I ordered the watermelon salad as an appetizer...MEH. I had the burger for my main (since the steak was unavailable) and was told that it would be cooked \"medium\". It was so overcooked and well done when it arrived I had to send it back. Also, it was just a lone burger on the plate.  Like seriously, would it have killed them to throw in a few fries on the side? What would that have cost them 50 cents a plate? So lame. For dessert I had the \"coffee and donuts\"...it may as well have been from Tim Hortons. 

My friend had the chicken as her main and it was sooo overcooked and dry...ironically, the table next to us had ordered the chicken too and had to send it back because it was undercooked. 

This restaurant is clearly having some management issues. They need to do something otherwise they are going to crash and burn. For starters, I'd get rid of the smug, bitchy manager who doesn't know the meaning of customer service.

Never.
Going.
Back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite restaurants! The ambiance is very modern and there is great service. The NY striploin and dulce de leche are delicious. Definitely recommend this restaurant for a special occasion."}
{"text":"I was disappointed. I was here for a business dinner, so not on my dime. The food was a real letdown. The server was good and we were a big group, that is not easy. But the kitchen didn't hold up their end."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time and left thoroughly disappointed. 

I ordered the brunch burger medium-rare, and it came out a decidedly tough well done. They were especially skimpy on the smoky mayo and avocado which made the whole thing a chewy, dry mess. Did I mention I paid $16 for it?

Service was cold and inattentive. The restaurant was basically empty and yet the food took 40 minutes to arrive at our table. 

Avoid."}
{"text":"Portions are too small and pricey ! It's not worth it. Be prepared to leave hungry :("}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. I love the atmosphere - its so romantic at night. The food has been pretty decent every time I've eaten there. My favourite items on the menu is the beat salad and I really enjoyed the burger and fries. My problem with this restaurant is the service. I found the hostess desk up front to have awful customer service both in person and on the phone. The last time I called to inquire about a group reservation I was treated so badly on the phone it has deterred me from going back ever since."}
{"text":"Complete fail, but learned something comical about what's happened to this now-chain restaurant:

Met my wife for lunch and was seated after waiting alone at the entrance for 3 mins. They had \"run out of menus\" but the hostess found two on the other side of this large space. Things improved briefly with a couple drinks and some delicious calamari. Then we get our mains -- my wife's chicken club's two main ingredients were dead; chicken and bacon so overcooked they were both extra crispy. My lamb burger, which I wanted med-rare, was medium well. Back it goes, they will \"bring a new one quickly\". 

Here's the fun part: the re-make takes 15 mins and I ask the manager what's up (she's regularly checking in with us at this point). She says the \"head chef\" is making it \"from scratch\" so as to get it right. She adds, \"We par-cook the burgers before lunch to med-rare then heat them up to medium to serve\".  What??? Am I at McDonald's?? They evidently do the same with the chicken. 

Well, the head chef is apparently a complete moron as lamb burger #2 comes out... Med-well. Sigh. He had \"carefully checked it\" before it was served to ensure optimally cooked albeit that wouldn't have included using a meat thermometer!! I eat the driest lamb ever as I'm starving and shortly thereafter, at about 90 mins, we leave. 

2 stars as the Resto took care of everything, service was acceptable and the calamari was great."}
{"text":"Where to start. From the minute we walked in the hostess was less than hospitable. 
The server took our drink order and received them quickly. He then ignored us for 10 minutes. We had to get the hostess to track him down. He didn't seem interested in us or his job. There was no enthusiasm. He was very disconnected. The food had absolutely no flavor. I ordered a sage rigatoni that had no sage flavor. It tasted like pumpkin pie seasoning and cream. My friend had the $24 half chicken. Just chicken on a sizzling platter. It was lacking seasoning as well as being dry. It did have a nice lemon flavor tho. We were ignored during our meal. Finally our server came to pick up our plates and noticed all the left over food. The only good thing he did was tell the manager. She did come over and apologize and told us that they had a new chef and would speak to him She did take one of the entrees of the bill. When I asked the server about the new chef he informed me that there was no new chef. 
There food is beautifully presented. To bad the flavors aren't there and the service is so mon existent"}
{"text":"Food was a bit to the salty side. I had the fish, it was so salty that I couldn't eat. Love their beets salad! That's a bomb! Also had pasta with mussels, not my kind of pasta, texture is too thick and doughy. We had the dessert platter, with nitrogen ice cream, tiramuse. It was delicious, but over priced. $19? Per person for the dessert."}
{"text":"I have a hard time with the negative reviews. I know it's not cheap, but if you like food that's been taken to the next level of flavour, you have to try it.
Can't really say more than that...and would love to hear your opinion.
This is, and will remain one of my favourite spots."}
{"text":"Tapas, eh? I went with the beet salad and tuna salad. 

The beet salad looked like a dessert but really it was a healthy appetizer. I did like that dish and I did take a photo.

The second dish was a tuna salad which I think was really too busy in a bowl. Slices of tuna at the bottom and topped with lots of cucumber, pickled ginger, popped rice and a deep fried seaweed to garnish. Wasn't a fan of the over sauced salad or big chunks of pickled ginger. 

If this is suppose to be an Asian fusion menu, there was no flow and continuity. Trying to hard to appease to the meat and potato palette and that is where I got lost.

Otherwise, our waiter was very educated on the wine selection."}
{"text":"Terrible service..not the servers fault but a poor business process. This poor service has ensured a table of ten who will never return."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Claudio D'Aprile since Colborne Lane.  His creative genius shines through yet again in his menu offerings at Origin North.  

My friends and I enjoyed tapas like menu options so that we can taste a little bit of everything. The pea risotto melted in my mouth and the spicy fries were almost like a poutine - loaded with chorizo, a spicy sauce, and tons of flavour.  The menu has something for just about everyone - even the pickiest of eaters. 

Don't leave without having their Northern Harvest, table side ice cream parlour - it is an experience like no other whereby a serve prepares ice cream, from scratch, right before your very eyes. 

Go here for a fun night out with innovative menu options that will wow all guests."}
{"text":"Only go here on your own. The sound level is deafening. I asked on entry, on a quiet evening with a half full restaurant, if the sound could be turned down, we were here to have a nice dinner with our friends.

The volume went down a tiny, tiny notch and the waiter told us that he couldn't turn it down any more - COMPANY POLICY.

The food was probably very good, but our brains were totally overwhelmed by the noise. (Music?)

I summoned the manager on the way out. She told that there had been two requests to turn down the music that night, but she couldn't comply due to company policy. She told me, unabashedly, that they always turn UP the volume for \"ambiance\" as the restaurant fills up. The wait staff get to \"rest their ears\" in the kitchen as it is always quieter.

What went wrong with dining?"}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't make sense to me. It replaced a mainstay of north York cuisine, Sunshines (famous salad bar). Origin north is very pricey, food is below average, ambiance is confusing (too big without character). Kind of helps to sterilize bayview area"}
{"text":"Dined on Feb 2, 2015.  Won't come back.

Reservation was made for two.  When arrived, a small table was provided in between two occupied tables.  I sat down and looked around.  Lots of empty tables.  Only three parties presented at that time.  Two parties of two took up two 4-seat tables.  I went back to request to be moved.  It was not busy while I was there.  My previous table or any other small in-between tables were never occupied.
Can't tell what is the focus of the setting - a bar, a dining room, a tavern, a romantic setting?  There was a bright neon sign in a dim surrounding, killing the atmosphere.   Open kitchen - so you could see there was a female personnel not wearing a hair cover working in there.
Service not professional and annoying.  Food was acceptable though."}
{"text":"If you love sweet and savory, you have to try the french toast with duck confit. The fresh blueberries, sour cream, and hoisin sauce make it a unique and tasty combination! The scones are melt-in-your-mouth delicious, especially when you spread the yogurt and apple butter jam on top.
 
We came here for brunch on a Sunday with a group of 5, and we were not disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been into this location a few times for lunch, as I work in the area, and I've really enjoyed the experience every time. The food has always been interesting and the staff are very attentive. On the rare occasion that something has been less than ideal, the staff are always eager to make it right, without delay and without attitude. This is very much appreciated. I would absolutely recommend this location to others.  If your ever in the south end of the city, the King St location is fantastic for dinner with the St. Jame Cathedral lit up across the street when you have a window seat."}
{"text":"Let's start with what is good...service is very attentive and well organized. The servers are friendly and know the basics about serving wine. It would have been a nice touch if the guy seating us put a smile on his face but maybe he was having a bad day. 

What's not great...what I had off their Winterlicious menu. I tried the Charred Octopus, Short ribs and Gingersnap with ice cream.  The 1st course was actually border line terrible with a salad of a few greens, 3 chickpeas, some basil and maybe mint? The octopus (3 pieces about the size of my pinky) was rubbery and had absolutely no charred flavour. The Short ribs was a small size but way over salted and tasted like a pot roast from the grocery store. The parsnip puree was really only a small smear, maybe about a tablespoon in size. 

Now the dessert...sigh...how can you screw up ice cream? It came in a stemless wine goblet, a wad of candied orange at the bottom of the glass, so called vanilla frothy ice cream and few crumbles of ginger snaps. The piece of candied orange could have been chopped so that a bite could be eaten with each spoonful instead of one giant piece. The ice cream was more like a whipped topping of some sort and too few ginger snap crumbs to make an impact.   

Portion sizes were to be expected since Winterlicious menus rarely are generous. I wasnt hungry but then I am a small person. Someone with a normal appetite will definitely go hungry.  No comment about the wine since they didnt make it in house and I picked it from a rather small wine list. 
Bathrooms are clean but having the toilet brush visible on a shelf was a bit weird. A storage cupboard is need I think. You can get them at IKEA down the street, just say'n."}
{"text":"So my colleague asked me what I wanted for lunch (she was going to bring back to our work) and asked her to get a beef carpaccio and two hand rolls. They refuse to do a simple take out order. Called the King St location and same answer. Suprised and pissed, guess they don't care to make some extra money. Won't bother to dine in here and will never recommend."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on Saturday morning for brunch. Waited an hour for our food to come, we were not served and the place was not even busy. We saw two groups just get up and leave. The food was not that great and definitely not worth the price. I was left hungry for more. Such a big disappointment. Only good thing is that they have a nice patio and dining atmosphere, but id rather take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"We went as a group of 8 plus a baby on the last night of summerlicious. Some of us ordered from the regular menu but I ordered from the summerlicious menu. I got the aranchini, mushroom agnolotti and the brownie sundae. All 3 were just ok. It was enjoyable but nothing special. 

The restaurant was not full but service was slow. The server was cold and abrupt. It took especially long for us to pay."}
{"text":"I agree with the other reviews. The food here is sub par for the high price you pay. I was there for lunch on a Saturday and ordered the cucumber pea mint soup, the chinois duck, and for dessert the kalamansi donut and an Americano. The soup was overly salty and the duck was basically a western version of the authentic Chinese style Peking Duck but not nearly as good. The donut was not bad but the Americano tasted like watered down coffee (how is this even possible).  The service seemed amateurish. Anyhow, it was overall a bit of a let down after the long wait for the building to finish bing constructed. I will likely not come back."}
{"text":"Had weekend brunch. Presentation of the Salmon Egg Benedict was not so impressed, given it is a higher end restaurant. Portion was so small.
Service was quite good, though."}
{"text":"You'll be under the impression you're going to a 5-star restaurant when you come to Origin North - the modern, free-standing building looks fantastic, and there are Porshes and Lamborginis in the parking lot.  The interior is equally nice - lots of high quality stone, metal, wood and glass, with suitably modern 'retro' lighting (looks great at night!).  This is how you make a good impression.

However, food and service were not up to par with the ambiance.  Our waitress was brusque and sullen, and did nothing to improve our meal.  Appetizers were very good all around - the sushi pizza was very tasty and the beet salad had an excellent presentation.

Then there was an hour wait for the mains.  Much too long. None came out particularly well either, and were not high-quality food or presentation.  Fish tacos were bland with tastless fries.  Lo-mein was oily.  Chicken was good, but vegetables underneath were not.

We saw some amazing looking desserts go past, but didn't stay.  The liquid nitrogen ice cream looked very cool.

We'll probably try it once more, as the location is great for shopping at Bayview, but overall it was a disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Orgin north can be a little pricey but it's definitely worth it considering the great food and exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Having dined at Origin North before and at Origin Toronto, we were expecting a nice Saturday dinner. 
However, slow service and average dishes failed to make up for the modern decor inside. 

Food: for apps, we ordered truffle fries and bufala mozzarella. Fries were layered with plenty of truffle aioli which was flavorful, however a bit too salty, and too much was added as we finished the fries with a heap of aioli left on the plate. Mozzarella was light and moist, but the bread underneath was not very soft at all. For mains, we ordered the origin burger, roasted chicken, and miso glazed black cod. Burger was ordered to be well done but turned out to be overly dry to the point of making it hard to swallow. Cod was cooked very well but the layer of stir fried vegetables underneath were actually burnt and charred; one of the more expensive dishes on the menu ($36), this was a big left down. Roasted chicken was done well, however some of the potatoes on the side were not cooked thoroughly enough. 

Service: it was a quiet Saturday night as the restaurant wasn't very packed. As such, we expected service to be a little better and faster than was actually the case. Two big issues with service: 

(1) I had finished my burger but my other guests were still finishing their's. As our waiter took my plate away he then began cleaning up the roasted chicken plate, which was only half eaten with side veggies still on the plate. By the time I needed to say something the waiter had already placed the cutlery on the plate, making it impossible to eat that plate or even pack it for take out. The waiter failed to ask if we were done with the plate or wanted to pack it to go, and did not even apologize for his misunderstanding or offer to help in some other way. 

(2) Having finished dinner and dessert, it took nearly 10 minutes to get the bill. It shouldn't take that long when the restaurant is barely a third full. 

All these issues added up, making the experience a general let down. Hence the 2 stars. We expected much better from Origin."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend last night and we were seated in the patio which was quite nice.  

We shared 4 dishes: 
1) Crispy Calamari 
This was the first dish that came out for us.  It wasn't what we expected as it was fried long pieces of calamari mixed with mango and pineapple strips in a peanut sauce.  The first thing I tried was a pineapple and the peanut sauce and this may be a bit blunt, but it gave me the reminiscent taste of emesis.  To me, it just didn't work together.  The calamari was good though but honestly....I just forced that dish down. 

2) Spanish Fries
My friend and I aren't big olive fans so when the waitress told us that there were kalamata olives in it, we asked her if we could exclude the olives from the dish.  She said that the olives were chopped up but that there isn't much of an olive taste b/c the chorizo covers it up.  That is a complete lie.  The olive taste was SO strong! If you don't like olives...do not order this dish! Even when I was just picking the fries and the chorizo and trying to avoid the chopped olives, I still tasted the olives.  The other thing was, that the fries were overfried...most of them were a dark dark brown.  We basically left this plate unfinished. 

3) Sparta Salad
This salad came topped with shredded nori and shredded fried sweet potato? The salad was fresh (albeit simple - I think it was just a cucumber salad) but it tasted good with the nori. 

4) Thai curry shrimp
This dish came with 4 pieces of shrimp sitting in some curry sauce and 1 piece of naan.  The curry was delicious but its such a disappointment that there's only 4 pieces of shrimp in the whole dish.  For $17 dollars, that's a bit overpriced for some bread and 4 pieces of shrimp and sauce.  The naan as well was thicker, not your traditional naan...this was more bread like. 

Overall, my friend and I spent $70 (combined) at this restaurant including tax and tip.  Both of our overall impressions was that it was overpriced and not worth the money.  The food at best was mediocre but I don't see either of us coming back here again."}
{"text":"I do love the ambience and if you are on a first date then there is privacy esp. on a weekday. However, very attentive waiters. Had to flag down. Not sure, if they become inattentive if they perceive that you are not going to order much.  The beef tartar app was really good. I was told that the seared salmon was really good too, however, I couldn't believe how small the portion was for the seared salmon. And what is up with the 5 oz wines? I have always seen 6 oz or 8 oz. That is plain cheap and ripping off."}
{"text":"Family went for winterlicious as my daughter wanted to try a masterchef's restaurant so we had high expectations.

To start, we sampled the cauliflower soup and beef tartar.  Both were excellent.  The beef tartar portion was more than expected.  Off to an excellent beginning.

For entrees, we had the Cornish game hen and flank steak.  A bit disappointed with both as both were served luke warm.; especially the rice with the hen and mashed potatos with the steak. Chicken could have been a bit more crispy.  Guess they plated but took a long time to bring to table. Taste and presentations; however, were very good.

Desserts:  chocolate pot and salted caramel sundae.  Good chocolate and excellent sundae.  

Very good service.  Also sevice time was excellent."}
{"text":"We went at 1 pm on a Saturday. The place was completely empty. They told us to come back at 1:30 pm. We were very puzzled because we could see several tables that were already set up and ready to go (they were not reserved seats)

They had one menu at the time: brunch. The 7 of us ordered eggs. It took them over one hour to make eggs. I had a clear view of the open kitchen. All three chefs looked like they had nothing to do. All three stood around with both arms at their sides. 

The basement washroom smelled disgusted. You could smell it halfway down the stairs. The toilets are designed so that they do not flush properly and many toilets could not be used. The fountain-style sinks would not always work."}
{"text":"Really pleased with the dishes we ordered.  Pricing is a bit steep but I find that with all tapas style menus, it is costly to order enough to be full.
Service on a Saturday night was not the greatest - the restaurant was completely booked so it was quite busy I just don't think there are enough servers.
All of our dishes came out REALLY quickly - before we even got our drinks. We actually had to ask for our drinks by flagging down someone to find our waitress.

Liked:  Truffled popcorn (it was good but not worth $11..didn't really expect it to be worth it but was interested in trying it anyway!), squash risotto (so creamy and rich and delicious), chicken wings (perfectly crispy, nice sauce and juicy), mushroom mozza app from the cheese bar was delish.

Average:  Thought the spanish fries were okay - fries were a bit soggy.  Burger was okay. Beet salad was okay (according to others, I don't like beets so I didn't like the salad)."}
{"text":"It was really good the first time I was there but the next time was just \"ok\". Even when I ordered the dishes I liked, it just wasn't the same.

I did like the bufala, pine nuts, pears drizzled with honey and rosemary oil. Beet salad was delicious too."}
{"text":"I visited Origin North today for the first time and was disappointed in the food and service, but not the ambience.  Having ordered the Sweet Chili Chicken with anticipation, what arrived was a bowl containing 6 bite-sized pieces of tough chicken, a sprig of something green, a few pieces of red pepper and salty, flavourless shrimp chips (the menu description said \"shrimp\" but you could have fooled me).  One of my friends ordered her salad with the dressing on the side.  It came coated in dressing.  I asked my server for another napkin, having had mine slip off my lap.  It never arrived.

The food was boring and tasteless.   I have never had Dulce de Leche made with cream cheese; not the greatest.  The coffee, however, was terrific.  My portion of the bill was $30, which really amounted to a 30 dollar coffee.

Chef Aprile should not be pleased with this review.  If I were Chef, I would start smacking heads together."}
{"text":"Very nice spot. Nice ambience and the food overall was Very good. Had the sushi pizza, fish tacos and braised short rib pasta. Dessert was a chocolate crunch bar. Service was very good too. 

Ambiance: 5/5
Food: 4/5
Service: 5/5
Price to Value: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"All of us have the squash soup, very creamy and smooth.  By the time when everyone notice and almost finish, one of us did not has the soup served!!

The roasted duck taco tastes good.  With the meat texture, sometimes it is hard to have a bite and a clean cut on the taco.  I hold it at an angle.  While I am eating, there is oil dripping out from the lower end to my dish.  The cod I heard is real good.  

I would like to try one day the BEEF RIBEYE 32oz but at a costly price of $89

I wanted to come to this restaurant long time ago but did not get a recommendation.  With my own experience, it is much better than I expected."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Could be better from drinks, mains and all the way to dessert.

Drinks seemed good but was nothing amazing. The burger was ok but presentation was poor. I asked for medium rare and it came out more well done than rare. Dessert was dolche de leche, but it was... Salty. 

Only reason I give it two stars is because of the company I had. Would not recommend. ... Why are they charging 8 dollars for a side of bok choy is beyond me."}
{"text":"Again, I was surprised at how packed the restaurant was on a Thursday night, I guess a lot of people do eat out! Luckily, we made reservations in advance. We were seated and our server was super nice and friendly and very attentive. I didn't know this was a tapas place at first but that's ok, my friend and I love to try different dishes.

We first started off with the Spanish fries with chorizo and manchego. It was spicy and tasty, it's like a poutine with choizo. Good start to the meal. Next was the Bay scallop ceviche with plantain chips. There was a good number of scallops int he ceviche, if only there was more plantain chips to go around.

Next, we go a thai curry shrimp with naan compliments of the chef. That was nice of them, it was really tasty. Hot curry sauce with fresh naan to dip. And then we had the chinois duck with flour tortilla, cucumber, hoisin, sriracha and sour cream. It is a white version of peking duck with flour bread. It was good but I still prefer the Chinese take on it with the crispy skin as well. By now, we were starting to get full and our last dish came - butternut squash risotto. This dish was a bit bland, it was creamy but not much taste in it, a little disappointed.

We were really full but we still wanted dessert. We had the walnut doughnut with fresh ice-cream. The doughnut was freshly fried, hot and crunchy. Very good. The ice-cream, there was some strange after taste to it that I don't know what it is. But the doughnut was good. It is not a place for a cheap meal but it was worth a try."}
{"text":"The rating is based on my Summerlicious experience in July 2015.

The restaurant is in the parking lot outside the upscale Bayview Village. The interior was huge; a perfect spot for a corporate venue and large parties. I could imagine the space being transformed into a lounge in the evening. I sat on the large patio to make use of the beautiful weather. 

For my pre-fix lunch at $23, I ordered the smoked heirloom tomato gazpacho, the saffron aranchini with sweet pea and zucchini crudo, and the salted caramel cone.

My fav was the cone and soft serve ice cream served in a bowl with peanut brittle. The berry sauce was refreshing and this ended the meal well.

All 3 items were tasty and the presentation of the dishes were beautiful, but the aranchini was more like an appetizer, so I left hungry. I need to come back to check out their regular menu to feel for the consistency of the food."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. No eggs and bacon on the menu which was dissapointing, but the did say that they could try and make it. Service was a bit lacking, coffee refills sporadic, no spoon provided with granola. Tasted fine especially bacon."}
{"text":"I'm using my last strength to sign up for an account and to write this review. Arriving at the restaurant we were all quite excited about our brunch. However, after right sitting down,  the waitress informed us of 2 of the dishes being unavailable. Considering it's only 1 PM on a Sunday and the menu was quite limited, I was already dissapointed. 

Despite it all we ordered our drinks and food. In the end it took over an hour for our food to arrive. Consideing the restaurant was only at 30% capacity, this is simply ridiculous. Half of our table had already finished our drinks before our food came.

In the end the food was not bad, but the experience has left an awful taste in my mouth. I will NEVER come back again and will recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday with reservations for brunch. Had been here on one other occasion for dinner and was disappointed with the service but a friend recommends it highly for brunch so we decided to give it a second chance. Out brunch started off on a bad note as I found out they charge for hot water, but improved slightly after we got our food. The smoked salmon Benedict was really good and the bacon Mac and cheese was warm and hearty. After we finished the food it went downhill again as we stayed a little bit to chat and the waiter ended up coming over three times to ask if we wanted the bill... We had been there for only one hour at the time and the restaurant was only 1/3 full. Although the food is not bad, this is a place I would never return to as there are places with much better service and similar quality."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered 5 dishes.   The food was outstanding.  We started with 
Beet salad, and Beef carpaccio.  The beets were dressed in a very tasty sauce, bursting with flavours.  The beef carpaccio was sprinkled with truffle oil. Delicious, but truffle oil is a little to rich for me to enjoy a large quantiy.  We order the Bufala, and it was done perfectly.  I did not like the bread that came with the Bufala so much since it was very hard, but, I know it was that way the way the dish was described. 
Our main dishes were the Thai Curry Shrimp and nan.  The shirmps were cooked perfectly and the sauce was exquisite and perfect for dipping the nan bread.  My wife had the chinois duck which was also cooked to perfection and very flavourful.
My only criticism would be the dishes came vey quickly, so we felf a little hurried, but since I wanted to get home to watch the basketball game, this was not significant.  Also, it has an open concept, so it is a little noisy.

I would defenitly go there again and recommend the restaurant."}
{"text":"I originally wanted to have my usual Sunday brunch at Oliver's in Bayview Village, but the wait time was too long so I nipped outside to Origin North instead.  

I was seated at the bar since no tables were open but was soon moved to the next available spot. I had the classic breakfast with bacon, sausages, two eggs and an amazing sweet potato hash. My friend had the same and my mother ordered the steak frites with eggs. 

They mixed up my well cooked eggs with my mums over easy eggs which we just switched without complaint. I asked foe salt & pepper (which were not provided at the table) and my friend asked for maple syrup (which she and my mum tried and did not enjoy however I liked it with my sausages). They unfortunately ran out of the peach mojito which ordered and I was really looking forward to. 

I was able to overlook my waitresses non-smiling demeanour and table dodging when we needed our bill (she was very busy) when we ended on a high of the Dolce de Leche.  The rich blend of creamy marscapone with lemon cake sprinkled with sea salt and pieces of raspberry and bottomed with tart greek yogurt. I would return for that one dish."}
{"text":"Date Visited: September 16, 2013

Last night, I dined out with my fellow foodies at the newly opened Origin North at Bayview Village. 

We started the night by ordering some drinks.  We ordered a few Somersby Ciders ($8) - a great, smooth drinking cider with low acid.  First time I saw them served in custom glasses. I love the thumb hold on the glass!

Our first tapas course was Devilled Eggs ($7) - smoked bacon, herbs, souffletine. I loved the whipped consistency of the egg yolks - rich, smooth, and airy. The bacon was crispy and the souffletine (crunchy, tiny cereal balls) was a nice touch. 

Next up was the Spicy Spanish Fries ($12) - chorizo, manchego. This was a great tasting appetizer.  You can never go wrong with aioli and fries. Add Spanish influences - chorizo (pork sausage) and manchego (a cheese produced from sheep milk) and you're got yourself a decadent hodgepodge of flavours. 

The next dish was Smoked Pork Lettuce Wraps ($12 for 2 wraps) - daikon, carrot, crispy noodle, peanut. The wraps were too sour for my liking. I imagine the sourness present in the wrap was to cut the fattiness of the pork but it didn't balance well. 

Next up was the Thai Curried Shrimp ($17) - with Naan bread. The curry was rich and full-bodied. The hot and soft  naan bread was perfect in sopping up all the flavour. The shrimp had a great firm texture - cooked perfectly. 

Next up was the Bangkok Beef Salad ($16) - Peanut, mint, mango, glass noodles, nam jim dressing. This salad had a light and refreshing taste to it. The beef was cooked medium rare. A feast for the eyes as well as the palate. 

The waitress told us that the Chinois Duck ($17) - Flour tortilla, cucumber, hoisin, sriracha, & sour cream was a play on a Peking duck. I wish she didn't. The wrap offered many of the right elements - hoisin and cucumber for example but I was expecting crispy skin and I was disappointed. The wrap was still solid, offering delicious duck confit. It was just not meeting my expectations. Also, the wraps that traditionally accompany a Peking duck are also usually very thin to showcase the duck, unlike the flour tortillas offered here.

Miso Black Cod ($33) - bok choy & ginger sauce. I've had many miso black cod in my lifetime and so I was hesitant to get all gung ho about this one but I had to try it. I thought the fish was very succulent and cooked well but I would have enjoyed it more if it was seared more. The fish also came on a very watery plate and it was diluting the flavours of the fish. The \"sauce\" was also very sour making the bok choy unpleasant to eat. Thumbs down. 

Dessert was Walnut Doughnut ($9) - caramel & soft serve. When it came to our table, the server poured heavy cream on the doughnut... Intriguing. First impressions: delicious!  The outer crust was full of cinnamon flavour and crunchy. The inside?  Warm and fluffy!  It was amazing!!!  Couldn't stop eating this one!

Chocolate Crunch Bar ($10) - Huckleberry sorbet. Every bite of this bar was decadent. The sorbet was light and refreshing. 

Thoughts on Origin?  Many Asian influences on the menu. Some hits and misses. I would dine again... But nothing really stood out on the menu for me to recommend it a \"must dine\" destination. Perhaps I should try the nitro ice cream next time?  ( http://www.urbanfoodie.me/2013/09/origin-north.html )"}
{"text":"Service is friendly but lacks the sophistication needed to justify the premium on some of the dishes. The tapas, such as the Chinois duck in a wrap...was simply okay.
I loved the buffalo mozzarella on toasted baguette with white truffle oil. I loved the tuna ceviche too. 
Walnut donut: just take one bite or you will have that specific deep fried nausea afterward. Please add a chocolate to the menu and fresh berries!"}
{"text":"Over-hyped. I have been here three times (twice for dinner and once for brunch) and each time I thought to myself that I'd give this place another chance. Service is okay. The servers are like robots. Don't think there will be a fourth visit..."}
{"text":"I had high expectations of this place going in after all I heard from friends.   The waitress was nice enough to give me a small sample of a beer on tap that I had asked about, but in the end we ordered 2 cocktails and mine was so full of crushed ice that it tasted more like a dilute juice.

For apps we had the spicy fries, which were a bit of a soggy mess and not spicy enough.  The beet salad was ok.

For mains we had the papparedelle with truffles and bacon, which was a tiny serving on a huge plate for $18, followed by my beef tenderloin which was again tiny and served on a sizzling hot iron plate.  The tenderloin was quite bland.  My wife's cripsy calamari was the only decent main of the night, although it's probably better as a appetizer than a main course.

For dessert we let the kids have cotton candy (nothing special) and the PB & J which is litereally that spreadon the side of the bowl, with a inverted ice cream with a cone.  The ice cream was terrible.

Final bill was $150 all incl (+ tip).  Overall a dissappointing meal, likely won't be back."}
{"text":"This place has changed a lot and upped its game in the past year. I loved the devilled eggs and the brunch menu has lots of selection. They also use really cool molecular gastronomy on the tropical storm dessert, with liquid nitrogen for the ice cream at the table. Fun experience for kids and adults!"}
{"text":"Best place ever. The food is very fusion and hipster-like. The atmosphere is lively and very modern. Open kitchen view and central bar area. It is located in North York just at the outside of Bayview Village Mall. The restaurant is run by the famous Claudio Aprile of Masterchef Canada and is just next door to Michael Bonacini's O&B Restaurant.

The food choices are fair and prices are also fair. They usually say it is good to order 2 apps and one main dish to cover your hunger. Don't expect for a cheap bill as the prices are pretty up there but you are definitely getting what you are paying for.

Although the restaurant may seem like an upscale type of restaurant, I from time to time make it a trip to just chill at the bar in my sweats and watch the game at their bar. They have a good 6-8 craft beers on tap and a wide selection of craft beers in bottles. Their bar tops are great and the bartenders are very experienced who do not make elementary level beverages. 

They can also customize your menu if you have a party of 6+ to make your party much more manageable. 

Very open concept.

Must go!

You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Went for the new weekend brunch menu and loved the pork belly tacos with heaps of soft scrambled eggs on top. I thought all the ingredients were very fresh tasting and the dishes tasted good and were presented well.

The brunch prices were around $12-16 for the main, which while not cheap, I thought was reasonable for the quality of the food and restaurant in general.

Service was at the right pace for weekend brunch, I did not feel rushed and we even sat at the table for a bit after we had finalized eating.
."}
{"text":"I made the BRILLIANT mistake of not checking the reviews first before I went here for our anniversary.   We are huge MCC fans so this was a given that we'd try it out sometime.  The food is amazing, and I know my food.  I have also been here for my birthday, so we have ordered pretty much everything.  From the apps, to the desserts, the wine list and everything in between, we love every bit of it.  It's gourmet at it's best, for north of the 401:) . And the decor is rustic yet elegant, very nice, a little too dark at night (can barely see my dinner) but still beautiful.   However, there are some pitfalls granted that if you go as a couple, you're bound to spend at least $100 if not more, on the bill.  The washrooms are deplorable.  Smells like a toilet exploded.  Maybe that's why they are downstairs.   Oh, and the wait staff said the reason they charge for hot water and lemon is because the owner, Mr. Aprile himself, was annoyed patrons would come and order just that.. HW&L.  Granted, it's pretty cheeky to come to a nice restaurant and order just that because you are at a business lunch and don' t have time to eat.  But for the rest of us who spend good coin, it's not really fair.  Mr. Aprile's counterpart, Mr Oliver B, whose restaurant is across the street, has terrible food (think Pickle Barrel) which is very surprising given he too is a MCC judge, but that's a different review..."}
{"text":"The food was tasty and came well presented  however, we had to wait over an hour for the food. This is despite making reservations. So, by the time the food arrived, likely, I would have eaten anything. I was also curious that they provided no bread for the table...I expected that nicety based on the location, feel and decor of the restaurant. Based on the foregoing, my overall impression was that it was understaffed, with a desperate air of trying to impress...perhaps another visit is warranted."}
{"text":"Forgot to take pics but loved the place. Long waiting time but nice service. Pricey but quite worth it.

A chef was at the front desk by chance and then started talking to me and my friend. Then he offered a free Lamb Burger if we order another burger. So yeah we ordered the original one and got the Lamb burger which is absolutely delicious! It was quite a small portion for girls as well so make sure to order something else."}
{"text":"I came here last night in absolutely terrible weather. I had to push my reservation twice and thankfully they didn't have any issue. 

We ordered the Spanish Fries, Chinois Duck, Shanghai Chicken Wings, Crispy Calamari and the Tapioca & Coconut Pudding dessert. Our favourite was the chinois duck because this reminded us of the Peking Duck wrap (in Asian cuisine). I could easily have 5-6 of these and be happy. The fries were done very well. The manchego sauce was very unique. The crispy calamari was another one of my favourites. The pineapple definitely was the ingredient that helped make the dish pop. If they made a salad out of that (minus the calamari), I would be just as happy. Out of all these dishes, the chicken wings was the least exciting. I was actually looking forward to this on my way here. There needs to be something else for these wings to really stand out.

The dessert is an interesting mixture of things. You can get some crunch, some softness and creaminess. I don't love it, but I don't hate it either. I wanted the doughnuts but I was told that they were removed from the menu (they can be found online still).

Overall, I enjoyed the dinner very much. I am definitely coming back here to try their brunch (french toast!)."}
{"text":"I was very excited to try the new Origin - finally, some competition and new scenery amongst the boring O&B and Il Fornello's of Bayview Village. I actually had tried to make reservations two weeks ago (for a Wednesday), but the place was fully booked! 

I had made reservations on Open Table for 4 people at 6pm. We were lucky to get a table for 4 on the patio, which by the way, is nice and expansive. We got a table facing the boat condo which meant that the sunshine hit us perfectly

I have been to the Origin downtown, so the concept is the same; tapas style plates meant for sharing. The waitress suggested to order 2-3 plates per person and so we had:

Fior di Latte with Truffle (3 pieces of bread)
3 Hand Rolls (Tuna) - I like my authentic Japanese hand rolls...this was way too \"fusion\"
Dozen oysters (very pretty)
Mint Pea Risotto (so yummy, my favorite dish and if I ever come here again, I would just order that)
Chinois Duck (Western version of Peking Duck - each order comes in two. This was my least fave dish)
Beet Salad (this was so weird...it basically is a big, red, ball of a beet)
Tuna Salad (the avocado was hard and the tuna was non-existent)
Dessert (Calamansi Donut) - too much Calamansi filling. Imagine drinking thick ooze.

Overall, the food was meh. I thought the food was \"meh\" at the downtown location, but this place is new and the patio was just so nice. I think this restaurant is very expensive for the food that you get. No dish is out of this world. This place would be better suited for drinks/cocktails and snacks, rather than a full blown dinner. 

That being said, I enjoyed my time at Origin. The service was en-pointe. When we walked into the restaurant, we had many people greet us. And during the course of our dinner, we had management ask how we were.  At one point, the second order of our Chinoise Duck failed to arrive and we got a free order of Snap Peas on the house. It was a lovely gesture.

I am glad I tried this place out. Another patio fave."}
{"text":"Ever since watching MasterChef canada, I've been dying to try this place. Unfortunately, it was quite a disappointment. 
The restaurant had great atmosphere and I had high expectations when I first walked in. The cocktail drinks were great and very unique. Great selection of non alcoholic drinks for underage students like me. We had the beef salad and calamari do start, both were yummy. However, the mains were terribly disappointing. 
I had the squash rigatoni. It was very sweet and tasted almost like a dessert. Usually I love pasta even if it's very average, but I just couldn't stand this one. My friend had the Thai curried shrimp which was yummy, but definitely not worth the price. Portion was tiny and it had very little curry."}
{"text":"Try the BUFALA MOZZARELLA , it's the best hadn't had it anywhere else. Staff is great creating a comfortable & hospitable atmosphere, will be back again."}
{"text":"Came here tonight curious about the place. Nice decor. Ordered appetizers - the Caesar salad was excellent. But then it went downhill. Ordered the 32 oz ribeye to share. You'd think it was one of their signature dishes. Well. An hour later it comes out...and it's cold. Really? At least the manager came out to discuss with us. We did appreciate that. Desert was actually great - we had the walnut doughnut and the cream soda float. 

The place has great potential but with so much surrounding competition, the details count. If the kitchen and the servers get better coordinated, then we've got something. I'll wait a bit before returning - hope they've got the bugs worked out by then."}
{"text":"Went today for Winterlicious, my mistake that I didn't ask about weekend service, where the Winterlicious menu isn't actually served. This sort of set the tone as upsetting, as I thought they could have mentioned that on the phone, but again, I should have asked. 

So I had brunch. I ordered the Tostada. Sunny side eggs (overdone) + Bacon + Salsa + Guac + Black Beans
This was tasty, although left me still hungry. But then again, I had prepared myself for a 3 course meal!

My Mom had the Smoked Salmon Benedict. It must have been good, because I didn't get a taste! :)

There were some service problems. We asked about the quiche of the day, which was Spinach and Feta, my mother asked how it was, and the server replied \"it's not the best one we have\". Fair enough, that I appreciate an honest opinion, however he also didn't offer any suggestions, which I think would have been much more helpful. 
As well, it took 3 requests to get more coffee... and then another request for sweetener.

Finally I asked what the Chocolate Crunch Bar involved, and the server explained it as being \"a chocolate crunch bar, with freeze dried berries and ice cream\"...  oh thanks, much more clear now.  In any case we ordered the Second Rush for dessert. Good tastes, but as I feel about the whole experience, I felt ripped off. Not just because I was expecting to come in for a $15 meal, but in general I have difficulty giving high praise for overpriced, yet underwheling experiences. The food was good, but considering the experience on the whole, I wouldn't be recommending Origin North."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to finally eating at Origin after hearing lots about it at Colborne Lane, and after waiting a long time for the construction to finish. Our meal started with the bay scallop seviche, followed by the sweet pea risotto and steak with mushrooms and a chimichurri sauce. Aside from the cook of the steak (which was overcooked), I loved the steak. It was well-seasoned, and the mushrooms and sauce were excellent. The risotto, however, looked more like a soup than a risotto. It was swimming in sauce and the grain was soggy as opposed to al dente. Further, the mint was overwhelming, and for me, it gave the dish a dessert feel. For the most part, the scallop ceviche was excellent. The sauce had a freshness to it and there was an excellent balance of acidity, sweetness, and texture. The problem lay in the scallops themselves, which were not as fresh as I would've expected. Had the dishes been executed properly, Origin would deserve 4 or 5 stars. However, there were too many errors in my dishes to justify 4 stars."}
{"text":"Good food, but somewhat disorganized staff and slow service hold this place back. 

Came here to try their new brunch offerings; I got the smoked salmon eggs Benedict, which came with a small arugula salad. The dish was fine - no complaints here. Ordered a fresh-squeezed orange juice, but it didn't taste freshly squeezed at all. 
I've been here for dinner too and in general Origin North has decent food with some creative twists. 

The dining room is decorated pretty nicely with a contemporary feel - plenty of wood furnishings and a dark yet airy interior. 

Perhaps it was just a bad day, but service was very slow despite the fact we saw our server running around constantly. The place seemed a bit understaffed and disorganized in general; we were attended to by three different servers over the course of our meal, yet our food came out slow and we had to flag someone down to ask for the cheque. No one came around to clear plates or offer coffee/tea or desserts. If Origin North can fix these issues then they'd definitely have a solid restaurant."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, I wouldn't say it was STELLAR, but it was not bad.  The beet salad was pretty good.  

One thing that is 5 star though are their Scones.  SERIOUS MUST ORDER.  Cheap and delicious.

If it wasn't because of the amazin scones I'd probably rate this place 2 star because service was kinda crappy.  Who brings you 2 coffees with only one spoon and one pack of sugar after asking us if we wanted sugar and cream?  (we said yes)

If you go, just make sure you eat the scones.  Your day will be a lot better I promise."}
{"text":"Got the Combo #1, which included the Origin burger, Spanish fries, and a float. All were pretty good. The float came in a mug and looked huge at first, but after the foam died down, it seemed like half of it was already gone.

Also got the Sunday Mimosa for 8 bucks. That was decent too.

Decent food but possibly a bit pricey (but then not surprising considering it's Bayview Village).

Quality: 7.5/10. Service: 8/10. Value: 6/10. Overall:7/10 (Not an average)"}
{"text":"If you have no reservations on a Saturday night, come here! Other than the nice modern decor, this place really has no other appeal. 

I gave this place a second chance as part of this year's winterlicious and they did not impress.

Ordered some octopus couscous. It had four pieces of tasteless octopus on bed of couscous. It had good ingredients and nice presentation but lacked flavour. Had the mushroom agnolotti. They tried to make some fancy mushroom ravioli. The pasta dough was pretty standard, filling flavour was okay, the portions a bit small, did not wow me. For dessert I had an apple spring roll with whip cream and cotton candy. Cotton candy is great as a complement. But the main Apple spring roll was soggy and not fresh. The whip cream was nice and fresh and was the best part of the whole meal! 

Overall service was meh and meh. Our server was inattentive and left us alone most of the night. The food portions were small and way overpriced! You can easily find the same for less or get more for the same price. Only thing good was the decor and atmosphere. When we were there there were very little customers, I can see why. I was really disappointed @claudioaprile ! I hope you are reading this. If this team was on the masterchef, they will be big losers!!!"}
{"text":"First time here as a party of 5 for a birthday dinner. The restaurant has a warm industrial ambiance with many unique light fixtures and hardwood accent walls. We sat in a half moon booth which was comfortable for the five of us.

Apps: I had the hummus. It was weird. The hummus itself was tasty but they gave me a dinner sized plate of it...and one tiny piece of naan to eat it with. So I wasn't able to eat it all...I suppose I could have spooned hummus alone into my mouth, but again, that's weird! Also found the eggplant caponata garnish very sweet. Others ordered the burrata/pear bruschetta. Tasty but visually unappealing. Beet salad was yummy but nothing you couldn't get at a million other restaurants. 

Mains: I had the fish tacos. They were tasty. Lots of guacamole and salsa on them. Nice crunch from the red cabbage. Fish n Chips, Lobster capellini, mushroom agnolotti, short rib pappardelle were also ordered. No complaints but no raves either.

Only real negative is that even though it was obvious we were celebrating a birthday (there were presents on the table) no special dessert or something similar was offered. Nor was the occasion even acknowledged. 

Overall a good meal. I'd go again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to come here for a summerlicious dinner and expected this place to be amazinggg.  BIG disappointment! The fried calamari app was unimpressive.  It only came with 3 small strips of calamari that were covered in sauce and under a small mound of a random coleslaw-like-mango salad mix they made.  The sauce was not good and it was way too sour.  

For my main I chose the chicken with potato and corn.  There was no corn at all on my plate, but I gotta say the mash was pretty good but it was legit the portion size of two tablespoons.  The chicken wasn't dry and the crispy skin was a nice touch, but the sauce it came with was literally like a regular gravy.  

Lastly, they didn't have the cinnamon bun like it said on the website. LIARS. So I opted for the parfait instead.  This was weird, sour and had some random things in it that I had no idea wtf it was.  Didn't even finish it.  The only reason this place is getting two stars is because the decor and ambiance are fantastic.  Also, I'm thinking maybe they are better on non-summerlicious menu night?"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars but didn't feel like it earned the round up to 4. Quick summary: pretty good food, modern and trendy display and interior, easy parking, a bit overpriced.

Came here for brunch on a Saturday at noon. Very spacious and there wasn't a wait (not sure if that was due to Canada day or DD). Came with 9 other family members and we tried multiple dishes.

Banana French toast- these were excellent. Caramelized bananas, pineapples, mixed with butter and syrup. It was sweet and rich, but definitely too much sugar (definitely share this with someone and don't finish it yourself)

Salmon eggs Benedict- well cooked. If I were to come back, I would get this and the French toast. Eggs were cooked perfectly and it tasted great with the salmon. Side salad was meh

Origin burger- an okay burger. Would go somewhere else if you wanted a burger. Fries were pretty good though. Fresh and crisp

My other family members tried the scones and the philly short rib sandwich. They had no complaints about it but didn't rave about the food. They're supposedly known for their scones since they're freshly made.

Because I came to Toronto for a family wedding, I didn't think the place was too overpriced because of the strong American dollar and the fact that I'm used to LA prices. But my cousins thought otherwise (I trust them because they've lived here all their lives).

It's nothing special. You get tasty food with a longer wait, but the lack of a wait for a table accommodates that. I wouldn't mind coming back here if I was nearby"}
{"text":"I couldn't even get past getting a proper reservation with these people. We told them we'd like to reserve for a bday party brunch involving 30 adults and 17 children. They came back with \"yes we can accommodate but there's a minimum spend of $2000 before tax and tip for a party of that size\". It makes no sense to me how you have a minimum spend of $47/person when a) your avg breakfast/lunch price per entre is $15-25; b) the reservation includes 17 children!! I'm sorry but my 1 yr old and 3 yr old are not going to be eating a COMBINED $47 let alone $47 each. Even if they had expensive taste for oyster and lobster for lunch! 

I've heard of minimum 20% gratuity added onto a group bill. I've also heard of a minimum spend that's within a reasonable range close to your average price but one where the average spend is nearly double? GOUGE MUCH?

I declined the privilege of overpaying and cancelled my request for a reservation."}
{"text":"Im kind of sad that summer is almost over, since Origin North has one of those hidden away patio's that never get too busy, Like my own little secret. Spicy Spanish fries and a beer to start, is a great meeting point for a place to drink before a weekend of summer shenanigans begin. Gonna miss you Origin North Patio!!! Till next summer."}
{"text":"I would give it 3.5 stars if I could but it's not worth 4. Service was great. Waiter was very attentive which contradicts most previous reviews. 

Ordered:
Duck taco - 2 per order. Duck was over cooked but overall flavor was good. Side of fries was great. 

Tai curry shrimp: was okay. 5 shrimp per order.  Was not bad but nothing to write home about. 

Bufala mozzarella: great dish. The honey and pear made it slightly too overwhelming on the sweet side but was very tasty overall. 

Wish I ordered burger instead of duck taco. Buddy beside me ordered it and it looked fantastic. The facility is amazing. Patio is really nice with lots of shade. Interior is very nice also. Sink in washroom is all show no go. It sprays at you.  Overall it was a let down. Maybe expectations are too high as its owned by a masterchef judge. 3.5/5."}
{"text":"Asian fusion restaurant . Beet salad , duck beast taco thing is recommended . Apparently they have this killer nitrogen ice cream , going to try it out next time ."}
{"text":"I have visited this restaurant three times over the past couple of years. The first time was amazing. The second was not bad and I guess I blamed that in being with a group of 10 people. My third and last visit was not at all recommendable. The second and third visit we had a waitress named Cora. Not only was she rude and condescending she actually would leave our table each time and go to other waitstaff to roll her eyes of makes weird gesture of what people in our party were requesting. The restaurant wasn't busy but we had to search for her to ask for something that was missing or to order a drink. Beside the horrible service the food portions had decreased and as well as the quality. The $43 steak was grizzly and lacked taste, unless you like over salted steak. For a cover of 5 people our bill was close to $500 without dessert. Last time we will visit or recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere
Decent food
Very pricey
Not too many menu options to choose from
Good service"}
{"text":"I was anxiously awaiting the opening of this restaurant and was a little disappointed when I finally tried it. I will give 4 stars for the decor and ambience. However, the food and service were sub par. One of my pet peeves at restaurants is when one person's food comes out way before the other's (awkward). I ordered the duck tacos. They were pretty good but not anything exciting. I found it was really overpriced for the quality of food. 

I'm happy I tried it but won't make an effort to return here."}
{"text":"Although this has been open for a while, it wasn't until my husband came here with friends and came back with rave reviews, that we made a rare decision to have brunch just the 2 (+1) of us. 

I love the high ceilings and spacious dining area. There is also a semi private area for large groups. Seemed like this Sunday morning our side was full of mommies and mommy to be's. It had lots of space for our stroller. It's trendy without being too pretentious. 

The price point is not cheap but affordable. Perfect for this neighbourhood I think, and MUCH better food quality than O&B. The menu  for brunch is diverse with Eggs Benny and French Toasts with a twist. It was the Duck Confit French Toast that my hb couldn't stop talking about. 

I decided to start with scones. It was really good and I recommend it. Warm and soft but it was really crumbly everywhere. We weren't given any plates for this and we just made a mess of the table. 

I got the Peanut Brittle + Banana French Toast. It was one of those dishes that look better on paper than in real life. The caramelized banana was nice, but the french toast itself was a little dense, and didn't seemed soaked enough with batter. I'm sure it was there, but I'm not sure where the peanut brittle was. 

Hubby got the brisket benny. It was tasty, but not mind blowing. Needed more hollandaise. It was a little dry but very filling. 

I still would want to go again, and try the duck confit french toast I've heard so much about. 

It was Sunday afternoon. Lots of space, although most people sat outside in the patio."}
{"text":"I continue to be impressed on my second visit here. The scones were great and well presented and the devilled eggs were truly unique in how they are made. Thumbs ip to Claudio Aprille."}
{"text":"We expected much more.  Origin is a restaurant that is priced at the same level as many Yorkville  restaurants. At first glance it looks quite nice but up close you see the poor design and quality. Very cookie cutter trying to be upscale. Uncomfortable seating -- every move made by your adjoining neighbour shakes your seat to the point where it's difficult to eat.   The ladies room was another room fraught with unfortunate choices, example no counter in the washroom by the sink meant I had to put my expensive purse on the floor while hand washing. 

When it came to dining I must admit the food was quite tasty. The appetizer came reasonable quick \"white bean hummus\" however being served with one naan made sharing difficult.  The mains served were the chicken dish and the salmon overall 3.5 for the food. Our server was pretty good but they must be low on staff in general since in the period of time we were seated there were at least three occasions where customers were walking around looking for the washroom without anyone helping them. 

I think when I'm spending in the $$$$ plus category the food, the service and the ambience/decor should be equally excellent. Comfort should never be an issue."}
{"text":"I really wanted to come here after I watched master chef Canada and especially try that BEET salad from the show... it looked nothing like the shows high expectations/presentation, there was beat juice (dark red) bleeding all over the plate. (Update: I gave it another try, and it was improved, looked a lot better and tasted better!)

Items on menu are EXTREMELY small for the price you pay. 

The fresh juices is more like a drop of puree mixed with water. No fruit taste for $6 a small cup (maybe 4oz)
Update: the lunch mocktails were more expensive and was in a tiny 4oz cup also, drinks are not worth it)

The food is OK but nothing special with lot of Asian influences. But Asian food is much better.

The wait staff was ok... even on a quiet week day night.

it's a nice place and good addition to Bayview village."}
{"text":"When driving downtown, I noticed Origin at the corner of King and Jarvis. It looked really popular for a Sunday morning so I checked out their website when I got home. I still have yet to go, but noticed that they were opening a location at Bayview Village (the only mall that I like). Construction seemed to take ages, but Origin North is finally open!

Both the interior and exterior décor are beautiful - the furniture inside is sleek and modern. There's a bar in the middle of the restaurant and patrons have full view of the kitchen, which I think is pretty neat. Since ON is in a mall, there are heaps of spots to choose from to park your car. It's also right by a subway station so it's easily accessible. I ordered the Origin Burger - the burger was delicious. Who knew that arugula, avocado, and mayo go so well together? The fries that came with the burger were just okay. 

Service was good - our food came out literally 5 minutes after order, it's like the kitchen heard us talking about the menu. This happened to me at Green Tea too and it bothers me; my sister's meal came like 30 seconds after we ordered and my mum and my meals came 5 minutes after. I also think that the price could go down; we drank tap water and only ordered our meals, but the bill came out to $60. 

I'm totally a-ok if I don't come back; it was nice to check out. The ambiance is certainly worth experiencing.

Good for: wining & dining with important clients, drinks, lunch"}
{"text":"Made a visit to Origin North for their brunch menu.  The room is decorated nicely with lots of large windows to fill the room with beautiful sunlight.  Great place for a brunch date spot.

The brunch menu offers a lot of variety and choice.  We started with the scones with jam & yogurt.  They smelled freshly baked and just crumbled in your mouth.  The white chocolate yogurt and berry compote jam complimented the scones well too.

I ordered a healthy and delicious veggie quiche with an arugula salad and resisted on the eggs benedict rockafeller (gonna get it next time!).  Others ordered their take on french toast dish that looked great.  Not too sweet with big thick slices of brioche bread, fruit, and syrup.  I was kinda jealous. :)

Service is good to great as expected from the sister shop of the Origins in the downtown Toronto location.

Would definitely make another visit when I am going to be in the area."}
{"text":"Like a child declaring the emperor has no clothes, I can now safely declare this restaurant sucks.

I managed to ignore what I truly thought was so so food a month back at Origin on Front.

tonight I was in the area and decided to check out origin north.

the experience was quite sub par.

Service was lacking...utensils continually being forgotten, glass of water would arrive after 10 minutes of the request (after asking second server) despite by girlfriend's mouth being on fire from one of the dishes. another drink she ordered didn't arrive-i didn't bother pointing this out.

on to the food
asian broccoli: i imagined something exotic would arrive. instead it was standard veggie tempura a la sushi on bloor
shiso peppers: meh
corn:  this dish had me thinking i was on 'just for laughs'. only there was no joke going on

for mains:
 calamari: you can get better at a pub
 black cod: good, but small and $32

desert: chocolate crunch: i have the sweetest tooth and actually put my spoon down without finishing this.

To summarixe, the place looks 'cool' inside and out. The food is a joke, overpriced and will leave you hungry. Im here at my house past midnight about to make a meal for myself. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Brought my family here cuz my previous experience/food was so great and I was not disappointed. My family loved it as well!! Service was great kept on coming by to see if we needed Anything and recommended which dishes would be good to share. Everything we ordered was delicious! My fav still has to be the Spanish fries.... YUM! The dessert on the other hand was just ok. Wish they had more variety.

I love the ambiance of the restaurant. It's very relaxing and quiet enough so you can carry a conversation throughout dinner. And it's modern and clean! 

Had yet another great dinner experience."}
{"text":"Good service but...

1. COLD burger (like it came out of a fridge) and no seasoning
2. Fries needed more salt

What water comes with no ice?  Server was good but it doesn't make up for the bad food.

Food - 1 Star

Service - 4 Stars"}
{"text":"Atmosphere isn't everything. Arrived here for brunch and we were impressed by the atmosphere. We didn't have reservations but the place wasn't busy and there were plenty of tables available but for some reason we were told there was a half hour wait.

we finally got a table and our waiter was as bland as our meal.

The menu is overpriced and under flavored. I could fathom a bad meal but not in the company of bad service and high prices."}
{"text":"The food here tastes amaaaaaaaazing!!! The dishes are fairly small which is great for sharing. It also allows you to try lots of them. This is a great place if you're going with a group of friends, but also nice for a couple who wants a more lively atmosphere. The place is very new and bathrooms are very clean... Their menu also changes frequently. Reasonable prices and great bar if you want to have some cocktails. After dinner you can go shopping at Bayview Village and burn of those damn calories you just devoured."}
{"text":"We were a group of eight there for winterlicious. Served promptly and the server was decent. Wasn't the friendliest but wasn't bad either. Quite efficient actually. 
The food on the other hand was absolutely superb.
The one thing that stood out for me was the beet salad. One of the best, if not the best salad I have had in the past while. 
Mains were nice as well. The dessert was OK. Nothing to write home about. Someone else ordered the apple pie, which was quite delicious. 
Would def go back again. 
Overall a pretty nice experience."}
{"text":"Origin North surpassed all expectations for ambiance but certainly need to differentiate and improve its food offering in order to justify the higher end of the brunch price spectrum.

Ambiance (5/5): Origin North is probably the best restaurant I ever had dine in recent memory in Toronto. The impression coming in is just \"wow!\". The high ceiling with floor to ceiling glass makes the room feel very expansive. The decor is smart, unique and again a wow factor. Especially on a morning/afternoon setting with a clear skylight flooding the room - it's very impressive. A great place for a date / business lunch / what occasion have you.

Service (5/5): We were seated very promptly and service was very attentive. We were provided with genuine recommendation and food arrived relatively quick. Prior our waiter finishing his shift he advised us that a new waitress will be taking care of us - superb! Our waitress also checks on us once in a while to make sure everything is in order. Again, spotless service.

Food selection (3/5): We found the brunch menu selection is average at best and not imaginative (classic, french toast, burger, egg benedict). I've definitely gone to a lower end brunch location which has more unique menu (one could easily do some spin on skillet, omelette, etc). 

Food quality (3/5): We ordered burger and salmon egg benedict and the overall impression on both presentation and taste is just average. This is something that you've tasted a thousand times. Rather- we felt that the cooking / presentation of this breakfast item is rather simple and shows very little effort the restaurant try to put into the dish. Especially with brunch menu where execution is taken for granted I feel that Origin North could put more spin to spruce up/elevate the dish more.

Overall score - (4/5)"}
{"text":"Came here for a friend's birthday today. We got the spanish fries, 12 oz steak, lobster spaghetti and origin burger. With their price point, I was expecting great dishes. But instead we all agreed the food was medicore and way overpriced. The staff were nice though."}
{"text":"Categorically disappointed.

For a restaurant whose owner's name - Claudio Aprile - is supposedly synonymous with high quality, Origin North really let me down like the Toronto Maple Leafs.

High credit goes to the decor and ambience of the restaurant, but that's where credit due stops.  For good reason too - allow me to explain. 

I came to Origin North on one windy, cold Valentine's Day evening. My partner and I are big fans of the show MasterChef Canada, where the owner and creator of Origin North is a celebrated judge.   

Well, between dishing out harsh criticism and as well as encouraging home cooks, Claudio perhaps should revisit this restaurant and be judged for what was a disappointing meal for myself and my date.

For the evening, we settled on the risotto with mushrooms,reggiano and truffle, and their combo number 1, also known as the Origin burger, with a side of their Spanish fries (chorizo and manchego, which is like a spicy mayo) and a float drink that I substituted for an iced tea instead.  I was given the option to order the burger medium rare, an option which I gladly took.

My order of draft beer and my partner's iced tea took far too long to arrive, given the restaurant was not at full capacity as well it being a past 9pm dinner, ordered drinks should have arrived far faster than 10 minutes I feel.

We were also told that their 12oz steaks for the night was sold out.  It being a long weekend (Family Day), and a marquee evening (Valentine's Day), I found this most surprising.  Surely there must have been a mix up by the supplier because how can you be out of steaks on a weekend, much less on a Saturday like today? 

During our interim chatter while waiting for our food, the exposed kitchen and its Expediter had what could be called a slight meltdown.  One of the cooks had made a mistake in not properly seasoning a salad or something rather, and the Expediter who was very vocal, called him out on it. Perhaps far too vocal because I witnessed half the restaurant stopped mid conversation to glance over at what was unfolding before their eyes.  Their faces said it all, they were exasperated and felt terrible for the cook that was being chewed out.

Minutes later after the spectacle in the kitchen, our food arrived.

While elegantly prepared, the taste of the food did not match the level of presentation.

My burger was very dry, and far from medium rare border lining on hard like cardboard. Furthermore, it was under seasoned, where's the salt, or flavor?  Buns were overly toasted, there were burnt marks all along the edges, obvious grill marks that the toaster was set far too high.  The Spanish fries were under cooked. Fries were not crispy at all and had a very starchy taste the more you ate it.  

The risotto did not fare any better.  The rice was chewy and also under cooked, mushrooms were perfect though however. It too could have used additional seasoning, as it was on the edge of being very bland.  Overall, a dry dish that could have used more sauce, as well as being cooked a little longer. Risotto should not taste like sticky rice, chewy and hard.  We did not finish both meals.

During the whole time, not once did our waitress check up on us to see if we were doing OK. A rule of thumb at most restaurants I've been to is that you want to check in with your diners about 5 minutes after they have received their food.

I wanted to bring to their attention the dry tasteless risotto and overcooked burger, but alas, she did not come by at all except to refill the water near the end, but by then it was far too late.  Overall service was satisfactory. 

For the price point and the celebrity name attached, we expected far better. For about roughly the same price point, one can venture into a Moxies', Joeys or Earls' for a better culinary experience.

The misses at Origin North far outweighed the hits.  Claudio Aprile perhaps needs to focus less on MasterChef and give more attention to Origin North.  If the cook that made our entrees tonight was on the show, they would no doubt be sent home.

Too bad. I wanted to like Origin North."}
{"text":"The atmosphere of Origins is more of a romantic setting. However, most of the booths are for larger parties. There is a giant bar right in the middle of the restaurant and they have a good selection of beers to choose from. 

For the appetizers, you have to get the beet salad. I've tried a lot of the appetizers and the beet salad is out of this world. The crispy calamari is also very good as I've never tried it with mango nor pineapple. 

The chinois duck is considered a sandwich course but it won't really fill you up so get it as an appetizer and share it. It's kind of like the Peking Duck that you can get at any Chinese restaurant. The Yucutan Fish tacos are also really good. 

If you go with a group of people, order a bunch of appetizers and share them. There are a lot to choose from.

For the main courses, you have to get the 32 oz beef ribeye. The chimicurri sauce is disappointing but the ribeye is really really good. Get it with a side of bak choy and brussel sprouts and you will be set.

Everyone needs to try the table side liquid nitrogen ice cream parlor for dessert. They literally make the ice cream at the table using liquid nitrogen. This is served on a gorgeous fruit platter and you eat everything together. The flavor of the ice cream is always changing. They had the vanilla flavor the time I tried this and I personally think that the liquid nitrogen removed a bit of the taste of the vanilla but seeing them make  ice cream with the fruits was an experience. The only problem I had was that I am kind of lactose intolerant and they used a lot of cream to make the ice cream so I had to rush back to my house to do a #2. 

You do need to check out the bathrooms. They have the high school type sinks where you have to use the foot pedal to turn on the water. This is the fountain type sink where everyone uses the same sink and the water comes out in the middle. My girlfriend (being from Brazil) had never seen this before so she had no idea how to turn the water on and ended up with a bunch of soap on her hands and no way to wash her hands. I got a good laugh out of this. 

The first time I came to Origin was after they had re-designed their menu. My parents told me that the original reviews were terrible because the the menu was completely over-priced and the portion size was too small. People would actually have to go to another restaurant after eating at Origins because they didn't get enough food and didn't want to buy another main course. However, after changing their menu, the serving sizes became bigger. The price is still on the higher side and I wouldn't come back here on a regular occasion. This would be more of \"on special occasion\" for me."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday night. It was my first origin north experience. Our waiter is very nice and gives good advice. I wanted to try many dishes that yelpies recommended, and my bubble dream ended at the moment when my boyfriend decided to order the 32 oz ribeye. The waiter told us that he has never seen any 32 oz ribeye finished by only two people. But we are not normal people, skinny Asians have their super power that is steak eating! We have it done just medium rare. Ordered a Caesar salad to start, which was a real delight! And the steak came, it's charcoal, for those oven steak lovers , this might not be your steak. Ours was just fine. No better than Ruth Chris and harbor 60 though. Then again, this is bot a steak house, its the other creative tapas dish tht made the name if origin. For dessert we shared a apple cobbler to top up out night. It's freshly baked with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Very very tasty, crumbly and warm, exactly what you need in a cold rainy night. Will come here again definitely, to try other dishes. A perfect place for date night. Oh btw, we finished everything, and our waiter was quite impressed. Lol!"}
{"text":"We has the deluxe degustation C$80 pp, each individual dish is nice but to have 3 salads, seems abit weird.  
Staff is nice but was slightly disappointed when we were clear that we are in a bit of a rush as kids need to get to sleep, all seems progressing well until the last dish where we hit a roadblock with a 20m wait for a ribeye. Slightly disappointed."}
{"text":"After trying all the mediocre restaurants in the Flops of Don Mills, sorry I mean at the Shops of Don Mills, we have decided to try the new Origin in Bayview Village.  We first looked at the menu on their website and found it rather strange, none of the European or Chinese standards; one is used to in most of Toronto's eating establishments.   After some hesitation, we decided to give it a try.  It is a very large room, with an open kitchen.  The noise level is rather high partly due to the serving staff shouting their orders to the cooks.  The four of us had a number of dishes and we found each to be excellent in both the flavor and the presentation.  One word of caution when ordering, they serve tapas size dishes, enough only for a child or a senior citizen.  The service is attentive and the price of each dish is reasonable, but you may have to order more than one main dish to have a filling meal.  We wish them good luck in attracting future patrons with their size and type of dishes.   
Food lover"}
{"text":"Do not come for Winterlicious! Overpriced mediocre food with the smallest portion sizes ever! I left hungry and truly disappointed. Upon complaining to the manager she offered to bring us an appetizer to sample from the actual menu to fill our tummies. Nice effort but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Very hipster scene. Decent, overpriced food. 

The food I find is not too unique and you can get it better, and downtown Toronto for a more convenient location for those that do not have a car. 

Came here for Winterlicious with a friend and had a decent dinner. Nothing too fancy slash nothing that really popped for me. 

One thing I really admire here is their service!!! Amazing hostess (Kayla, the one with the afro ); they're very attentive and friendly. The servers are almost as great and will keep your glass consistently full. 

Again, I would argue the food here isn't exactly unique (Nuit Social on Queen St W does a much better Winterlicious with basically the same dishes but tastes better and is cheaper). 

Overall it's okay, however with all the other options around in Bayview village, I would not come here a second time."}
{"text":"I love the location, I love the interior decoration, I have no problem with the food and drinks but the service here is just suck!  I guess 2 stars for this restaurant sums up my past 3 visits to this place.  

I came here since it first opened.  I was impressed with the interior decoration.  The food was ok.  All I remember was the dessert I ordered.  It tasted ok but the very creative presentation made my day.  Service was really so-so for a newly opened restaurant.  I thought it could be more welcoming and attentive.

The second time here was just a drink and dessert experience with the fellow yelpers after a UYE dinner.  The cocktail I ordered was citrus flavor but very bland.  My bf ordered a manhattan drink and the comment was don't order it.  He wasn't satisfied with his first drink and so ordered a beer but a taking-forever second round.  He had to wait and asked the waitress twice before his beer came when the place was pretty empty at the time.  I ordered a lemon curd as my after-dinner dessert.  Like the first time, I was impressed with the presentation.  Besides, it tasted fresh and just the right amount of sweet.  At least, I was totally satisfied with my dessert.

The last time was the Summerlicious lunch ($23) just a week ago.  I found the menu looked good.  The hostess at the front door was busy with another customer, so I had to wait for a moment but she was nice enough to lead me to my table.  My friend and I was happy with the Smoked Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho and Tempura Haddock with Japanese noodle salad + scallion aioli we had.  Everything seemed right until our waiter started to be very preoccupied with his other tables or just laid back?  So far, he came to our table once to check on us.  He wasn't even the one who served us with the dessert.  Mentioning about the dessert, we both had a lemon curd.  Since I was so impressed with the lemon curd on my last visit, I suggested we could both have it.  I was very disappointed when it came.  It was only one-third portion of the one I ordered last time.  The presentation was not lovely at all and it tasted too sweet this time too.  Ok, I understand it was Summerlicious, so be prepared lol.  

However, the most disappointed part was that the waiter, all of a sudden, brought us the bill without us asking for it when we were just having our dessert and our tea/coffee.  He was mumbling while he put the bill at the corner on our table.  Could you please speak up?   Well, we were not supposed to order anything more, right?  Should he check with us first or he just wanted to make sure we pay?  I thought he might have just finished his shift.  Ended up, it was not the case.  We paid cash, he returned the change to us but he, sort of, slightly threw the bill folder back to us at the far end corner of our table.  I had to lean on the table to grab the folder myself.  Seriously?  What did we do to make him, all of a sudden, provide us such a service attitude?  All right, I assume he didn't do it on purpose, but serious restaurant training for him please.

In general, what a waste!  This place can do better than this.  I believe I gave it enough try."}
{"text":"4.5 stars 

I came here with a girl friend  for dinner.  The restaurant is massive - and good for groups or a romantic dinner with your sweetheart.  

We had:
BUFALA MOZZARELLA + grilled bread + poached pear + pine nuts + honey
SWEET POTATO & KALE SALAD + pumpkin seeds + apple + sweet soy
MISO GLAZED COD + bok choy + sesame + yuzu + scallion
SECOND RUSH (DESSERT TOUR): Truffle + cotton candy + chocolate pot de crème + cookie

There was also a lamb burger that we ordered that doesn't appear to be on the menu any more.  The cod didn't have much bok choy, but they gladly grilled us some more when we asked.  Everything tasted delicious - absolutely no complaints.  Even the portion sizes were perfect.

We saw the Northern Storm being made a number of times.  It looked great, but we were so full after our meal that we wanted a smaller dessert to share.  

The service was great; friendly, attentive - but didn't make us feel pressured when we wanted to just catch up and not order anything else

The meal was absolutely delicious with many flavour combinations.  It wasn't too expensive, though I thought it was kind of strange that we had to pay $2 each for tap water."}
{"text":"As always, a fantastic lunch. The food and ambiance has made this my go to business lunch location. The Japanese Tuna Salad was very tasty. An excellent  blend of flavours. Refreshing and light on the stomach. The avocado soup was also pleasant. Origin Burger continues to be a wonderful and dependable choice. Very nice cappuccino. Only low point, front reception was in a bit of disarray today - several prospective diners milled about waiting for some minutes for someone to appear at the desk. Lunch for two continues to hover at $60."}
{"text":"Food was good, my friends and I ordered a bunch of different options on the brunch menu. Nothing really stood out except for the devilled eggs and the beet salad. However, the food wasn't the issue. After we finished our meal, we paid the bill and left. We were walking down the street when our waitress came running after us. She told us that she had charged us the wrong amount and asked us to come back and pay for the items that weren't on the bill. She did indeed charge us the wrong amount... We came back and paid the rest, but we found this extremely unprofessional. When my friend told the waitress that she should be more vigilant next time, she blamed the mistake on the manager. To be honest, I don't care whose mistake it was. You can't chase customers outside of the restaurant to ask them to pay more when a mistake was made. Absolutely ridiculous."}
{"text":"A great place for date night with awesome Asian fusion food.  Plates are relative small tapa style so each person needs two dishes."}
{"text":"I was here for winterlicious last night for a group of four at 8:45pm.
The interior was fairly pretty, but even at half capacity, it is hard to hear anyone over the table due to the unfinished ceilings. Even with the romantic tea lights, it wouldn't make a great get to know each other place. We were not asked if we wanted drinks and ended up ordering them along side the food. The cocktail I received was very strong. Vodka and blackberry purée in crushed ice.
The food was pretty bleh, especially for what would be considered a higher end restaurant. The starter lentil soup with curry yogurt and pulled pork was probably the best course of the night, but it tasted like curry powder. The main I had the chicken supreme which was okay. The meat wouldn't fall off the bone and it was pretty hard to cut with knife and fork. The mashed potato was wonderful with a sweet kick. The greens were decently cooked. The chicken was quite dry however.
For dessert I had the pavlova which I would not force upon my worst enemies. The presentation is nice but the food itself is terrible. Two slivers of average meringue stuck into a lemony tart that probably contained ALL the sugar on this side of the earth. I personally have a sweet tooth and I was still knocked out by the disgusting sugary aftertaste. If you value your taste buds at all, don't get this. The blueberries stuffed into the lemon were half dry and crumbly and half soaked...don't see the culinary artistry in that. I had a headache from this after, or maybe because it was my drink that was half pure vodka.
Finally, the service was mediocre. The waitress seemed rushed (but was happily willing to attend to other tables minutes at a time) and didn't seem to take her job seriously. Our courses were spread out over two hours and we were antsy to leave. She came around with a debit machine in one hand but started talking to another waiter then walked away! Really?? 
If you do come here (don't) then come earlier so that you might get faster service...but that just might be because they want your table empty faster."}
{"text":"I went on July 21st for summerlicious which advertised steak frites and creme brulee on the menu. I get there and they were replaced by a burger and a donut the size of a timbit. I was peeved and wanted to launch a complaint with the manager. The waiter refused for the first 4 times of me asking, saying that she knows and she's busy. Eventually, the waiter asked the manager to come over to talk to me so I can launch the complaint. The manager was stubborn and kept trying to prove that the summerlicious menu reflected the new changes of burger and donut. All at the same time, we were able to pull up their \"old\" menu to reflect steak. Apparently, they don't have any steak in the restaurant, even though their other restaurant menu had one. They blamed it on their supplier. We decided to stay and go through with our overpriced burger dinner. 

During our dinner, the manager printed out a copy of the new summerlicious menu and put it on my table saying \"see, I just printed it off, it's changed.\" And again, I responded with we're able to pull up your old menu somewhere so someone obviously made a mistake. We didn't make up your menu. She didn't want to offer any sort of compensation for misleading us into coming all the way to the restaurant to dine and kept trying to prove that she was right and making up excuses as to why changes were made to the menu. 

The food themselves were awful and of miniature proportions. The salad was fine but the burger was burnt. It mostly tasted like bitter from being charred on the outside. The patty also had no flavour, like no one felt like it was necessary to season the meat before turning them into patties. The dessert, strawberry shortcake with creme, was not great either. The shortcake was the size of a timbit, the creme was half a tablespoon and drizzled with a bit of strawberry sauce. The shortcake was stale, crunchy stale and tasted like flour. Creme was fine. My friend who got the frozen yogurt with chocolate cookie bits in the bottom was equally terrible. When he read frozen yogurt, he though froyo, like icecream-like. No, it was crumbly frozen greek yogurt. It was disgusting and again, was tiny. I took pictures of the food. Though they look great on camera, they are small and tastes bad.

We were super disappointed and felt tricked into coming here. We never got an apology from any service staff either. Bad service, bad food. Definitely do not recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Studied the menu online for quite a while and after 30 minutes looking it over in great detail I found myself lost in what to order. Nothing on the menu stands out as a great dish even with all the great description. For an upper scale restaurant I was expecting a better menu selection. 

Came on a Friday night and surprisingly the place was not that busy. 

Truffle popcorn for $11. Tasted good but portion was unacceptable. You get like two handfuls of popcorn. 

Devilled egg $8. This was pretty decent. I really liked those mini souffletine's nice crunchy texture. The presentation of this dish was pretty funny to me. The place a piece of bacon standing vertically on a half cut boiled egg so I thought the shape resembled a mini toilet. Nothing wrong with that of course but just funny.

Origin burger $17 + Spanish fries $5.95 - The burger was good but nothing special about it either. The Spanish fries was their take on poutine. It tasted good but even after eating it I'm not sure what I consumed and even after reading the description on the menu I am even more lost. The important thing though is that it tasted okay. 

Chocolate crunch bar $12 - It was a home made chocolate bar. The chocolate was smooth and a bit soft like fudge. Comes with a scoop of ice cream and a thin cut orange that was deep fried so it was like a potato chip. Tasted okay as well but nothing great worth mentioning.  

Service was excellent and fully expected from a place like this. We were waiting for out other party members to arrive for more than an hour and they never rushed us to put in our orders.

Overall I found the food pretty average and the quality of the food does not justify the price.

Another thing I found weird is that they have a bar area but no chicken wings on the menu. Weird."}
{"text":"Great Brunch - nice variety of salads, breakfast food and other combinations.  Steak and eggs, sweet potato salad and banana/pineapple french toast at the table.  All received well.
Scones warm out of the oven flavour served with honey butter and black current jam.  Even had an opportunity to meet the master chef owner.  A real treat - heading back soon.  Only concern was uneven service - but not a major issue.  Go soon"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying this is one of my favorite restaurants. Normally it is perfect from the food to the service to the ambience. Despite Saturday night, we will return again because everyone can have an off night, and the Manager knew it was off and comped a couple of things on our bill due to \"problems in the kitchen\"

First off, egg pasta for my child who I had mentioned has an egg allergy. Thankfully I noticed. Instead she got a hamburger patty with cheese on a plate with fries - she couldn't have the bun and they forgot to bring the promised bread to go with it. That said, child declared it the best party ever.

Beet salad to die for - my favorite dish there. The tostones with guacamole my husband had were also delicious.

At some point we realized they forgot to cook the entrees for my husband and I. When we finally got them the salmon in coconut broth was so good. His burger was delicious, but he was a bit disappointed they had changed it up and we're now serving it with guacamole instead of the mayo.

We gave up waiting for dessert menus and after a few attempts I flagged the Manager and indicated that we were not having a typical experience, had given up on dessert, and would like the bill. A few minutes later our server wandered by and apologized and we asked again for the bill.

I'm putting this up here as I plan to check reviews before we go again in future. I hope this was a one off, but the fact that the restaurant was 1/3 full on a Saturday night of Mothers Day weekend wasn't good. It's normally hard to get a reservation."}
{"text":"Food is delicious but kinda on the pricey side and portions are ...adequate.... so more for special occasions and fancier appetites."}
{"text":"Yay for another good restaurant in the area! I came here for a light lunch so I cannot comment too much on their dishes. Sat on their beautiful patio on a nice sunny day, and ordered a rose wine and the scallop ceviche. The ceviche came with plantain chips and it was delicious, so good I had to get more chips to dip in (they were extra). The waitress was great, personable and very attentive. This is a good place to come with friends or for a date. I already love Origin's brunch, so next I have to try their mozzarella bar during dinner. Looking forward to that."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for a quick bite. But just don't look for value. It is way over priced for what you get and service can be very shoddy at best."}
{"text":"As suggested in my original review, we have returned to Origin North at least 30 times since originally writing. Do not hesitate to have dinner at the bar. It's the place to be. The kitchen is consistently very good too."}
{"text":"First & last visit to this over-priced eatery. Having not visited their other locations, I was not familiar w/ their concept - that being, over-priced \"entrees\" - which are actually appetizers. This s/ please the well-heeled Bayview Village crowd who are accustomed to avg food in this area & paying way too much for the privilege.  We had what was supposed to be dinner w/ 2 other couples. Along w/ a bottle of wine, we paid $320 + tip to eat small portions that did not deliver on flavour. Someone also needs to work on the ambience here - all night Hall & Oates & Queen blasted over the sound system...just plain weird. For all the $$s spent on building this monstrosity, Origin has been more than happy to pass the buck to its patrons. Well done, I say - save your shekels & head elsewhere"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the quality of food has diminished substantially. 
Tenderloin was marginally under, but that's better than over. Squid, Caesar, and not so crispy beef were less than adequate. 
Service was good and attentive. 
We finished the kids pasta leftovers, and we both commented on how the kids pasta was better than our food choices. 
Food = 3, service = 4, value = 0
Unfortunately, used to be family go to. No more."}
{"text":"Attention:   SKIP THEIR SUMMERLICIOUS MENU.  You're better off with their regular menu.

My friend set up a dinner party for a table of 8 here today.   We were having their Summerlicious menu.  Now, I am not a huge Summerlicious fan, but I saw their burger on the menu and knew it was a good from dining here before.   Regularly, it cost $17 and the Summerlicious menu was set at the prix fix price of $25.    What a deal right?  NOT!  Let me explain.

What Origin tried to do tonight with the $25 set price was to cheapen the ingredients on their menu.  Umm...  Isn't the point of Summerlicious showing people what your restaurant can do on a normal daily basis?  Which means, showing your best, so people will come back?!  Please note, there are 7 other people invited to this dinner party who haven't been here before and they are waiting to be wowed by this Summerlicious menu in order to be convinced to come back.   Well, I am sad to say, you lost 7 potential customers, as I couldn't convinced them that on a regular non-Summerlicious day, Origin is actually pretty good.

Their watermelon salad was a joke, as the plating was done on a ridiculous large plate.  Less than half of the plate had the watermelons in the shape of a smile.   We were like,  what happened to the rest of the food?   Improve your plating skills or improve your portions for this size plate.  I don't care.  It just looks plain silly.

The burger?  OMG, don't let me get started on the burger.   Normally, it's beautifully presented, with a side.   Well, it came served on a small plate that was no bigger than the burger.  Weird, because it looked like the chef must have been sleeping on the job because they got their plate sizes wrong!   The burger plate should have been used for the watermelon appetizer instead.   On top of that, the meat patty was half the size of what it normally was - FLAT almost and very tasteless.     And they just gave you a few strands of arugula as suppose to a handful that you would normally get on their regular menu.   Then out of the corner of my eye, I saw the next table order a side of fries with their burgers.  Uhh, WAIT A MINUTE here, I thought we can't order outside of the Summerlicious menu?  What is going on here? So, we too, order a side of fries which cost $4.00 each.    Really, a little burger sitting on a little plate just looks plain silly for an entree.   So really, our Summerlicious dinner cost $29, not $25.    Fries was tasteless, as I think they forgot to sprinkle salt on it.

Dessert was meh...  just some mousse fruit parfaits or a super mini donut.  Nothing spectacular that they would normally house.  But hey again, my friends have never been here before, if you don't feature some wow factor in your dishes, why should they come back?   

I might come back again if I am craving for their Mozarella bar.  But I am so put-off at what they tried to serve tonight on my friend's birthday party with their Summerlicious menu, that I'll just make the mozarella baguettes myself...possibly.  Lolz.

Oh yes, I guess for a group of 8, they charge gratuities of 18.5%?   I am sorry, but the service wasn't exceptional.   The waitress never even asked us if the food was good.  I guess she knows it wasn't since she didn't ask.   

Anyways, I guess the saying goes for tonight - you get what you paid for?"}
{"text":"I came here on my double date for Summerlicious ($25 dinner).

I got the calamari with chipotle aioli, burger (with avocado, smoked mayonnaise and arugula) and coffee and doughnut dip.

The calamari was very interesting (in a good way) because there was a dusting of peanuts. The lightly fried calamari was delicious with the candied (I think) peanuts.

The burger was quite disappointing. It wasn't juicy compared to some of the other burgers I've had in the past at other restaurants. I was also disappointed that they didn't include fries with the dish (it is Summerlicious after all!). Definitely not the worst burger I've ever had nor was it the best.

Lastly was the coffee and doughnut with creme brulee. The doughnut was not soft and puffy but the dip that it came with was packed with coffee flavour.

Overall, the meal was just above average. I'm not sure if I'll come back here for dinner..."}
{"text":"the food taste good, environment is nice. but the choice of the main course is a little bit less"}
{"text":"Loved the décor and atmosphere - it wasn't too loud.

The food was great. It definitely isn't somewhere you go if you're starving and want a lot of bang for your buck in a quantity sense. We tried the pierogies and the Spanish fries from the snacks/appetizers section and both were quite small in size. There were only 3 pierogies though they were served with a really well-paired sauerkraut and sour cream. The Spanish fries had some spicy chorizo chunks on top along with aioli, both of which went really well together. Fries tasted fresh and both dishes were served piping hot.

We also tried the beet salad, which, although simple, was quite delicious. The beets were roasted well and paired with a sour cream as well as goat cheese and beet leaves. There was enough flavour for it to not taste bland though it was best shared rather than consumed alone as it's a lot of beet content for one person to eat alone. 

The main that we tried was the salmon. The seasoning on the fish was a bit on the saltier side and it was served along with capers and olives, both of which were also quite spicy. The side veggies and pesto sauce were a nice touch, although a bit oily.

For dessert we shared the mango coconut tapioca pudding, which was incredible. It was served with mango shaved ice and two caramelized bananas. Both were just the right mix of flavour and complexity - definitely one of my favourite dishes in its entirety.

Overall, the food erred on the expensive side. I would say that your dollar goes far in that the ingredients are fresh and the plating is incredible. Definitely go for the experience and the ambiance, not necessarily to fill yourself up on food."}
{"text":"I've been watching the evolution of Origin North take shape; I live just down the street so it was neat seeing how it all came together over the last year. I've never been to other locations but my first visit here was pretty successful.

I came here for lunch with a friend on a Saturday and it was already quite busy, but service was amiable and efficient. I enjoyed the beet and goat cheese salad the most out of everything we ordered. 

We were fairly warned about portion sizes, so I don't think that's really a drawback. That being said, you do need to order more food to feel satisfied. I left slightly hungry but it was so hot outside that I didn't want to overdo it. 
I look forward to visiting again!"}
{"text":"After a week long of all you can eat with the family, my fiancé's mom asked that we dine in a normal \"portion\" restaurant. Found and was attracted to Origin for the fact that it reminded me a lot of Zengo in the city with its Asian fusion menu and offering of small plates. By the time we decided on the restaurant, all the available reservations were not available on opentable. We gave them a call anyways and was able to reserve a table for the 6 of us at 8:15 (a bit later than my usual dining time but so worth the wait!)

This restaurant is truly gorgeous. My fiancé's parents and aunt were so taken by the decor and floor to ceiling windows - they thanked me instantly for just finding this place as we were entering. We were seated immediately into the really comfy leathery booth in the corner. Our waiter soon came to greet us and explained the menu. Everything looked so appealing on the menu. After a few recommendations, we decided on fried calamari, shanghainess chicken wings, butternut squash risotto, pan fried branzino, and 3 burger specials which individually came with soda float and Spanish fries. We also decided to share the masa chips and bay scallop ceviche.

All the food came out promptly and we were soon feasting away. The masa chips came with guacamole dip with a blend of unique spices on top. Yummy but not too memorable and the chips were a bit too fragile/crumbly to efficiently scoop up any dip. The bay scallops ceviche was swimming in this aromatic coconut creamy sauce. It was a bit heavier and sweeter than expected but still extremely tasty - the scallops were so fresh!! 

I had a bite of the burger and it was definitely a $20 justified gourmet burger - loved the guac spread and juicy patty. 

I really wished I ordered the risotto myself because after one bite, I couldn't help but eye if my soon brother in law would finish his dish. Rich, creamy, and with the perfect texture - there were small cubes of sweet potatoes which added a bit of crunch. So so so good! This dish definitely made it on my last meal on earth list. 

My branzino although well made, tasty, it was nothing special. The chicken wings were so well cooked and seasoned. Although they were deep fried - the meat stayed moist and pulled off the bone goodness. 

The only true letdown were the Spanish fries that other yelpers have raved about. The chipotle mayo with chopped up olives didn't do it for us. We had to scrap off the toppings and sauce to actually enjoy this dish. 

Aside from the soda floats that came as a combo with the burger, we decided to end on Second Rush and nitrous ice cream sundae (minimum 2 ppl). The cotton candy machine was broken the night we were dining so they replaced it with another flavored cheesecake. Cheesecakes came in a small cup along with my chocolate cookie and truffle on a stick - presentation and taste were just okay. Maybe because I was comparing it to the nitrous ice cream show where they actually presented us the ingredients and demonstrated how they made it in person. This dessert itself was magical and I loved everything about it - the maple syrup ice cream was not overly sweet and had a nice mixture of dried, fresh fruits, cake bites, chocolate crumbs and bits right underneath. Each bite was heavenly. We asked for a 3 portioned size and was enough for the 6 of us to share. The soda floats then were just icing to the cake. Creamy soft serve in a cherry flavored bubbly goodness.

We were beyond stuffed - so much to skipping buffets. Awesome service, food and ambiance. Would love to return to try their next seasonal menu!"}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch!  Try the French Toast with duck confit. The granola is also delish and great for sharing."}
{"text":"This may be the worst culinary experience I have had in years.  

First, when we called for a reservation on a weekday during summerlicious we were told that they were booked but that they would \"squeeze us in \" at 11:30, which is interesting because when we arrived at that time the restaurant was three quarters empty.  Making the matter worse overheard the person responsible for taking reservations over the phone telling prospective customers that they were \"Booked for the afternoon\".  We were there until 1:30 and I can assure you that the restaurant was never more than half full.  I have a problem with restaurants being disingenuous with potential customers and being rude about it as well.

The waiting service was questionable at best.  During our lunch, our server was changed three separate times.  We waited extensively for someone to take our order.  Wait time between our appetizer and main course was also too long.

Our first course, the samosas were overcooked and were of less quality than frozen samosas I find at Sobeys.  

The real scare of this trip was the main course - the fried chicken sandwich.  The batter on the chicken was completely burned.  I don't know if someone forgot it in the fryer but it clearly spent too much time in the grease pit.  I can honestly say that for half the money I could get a crispy chicken sandwich of far higher quality at KFC.  

My wife also ordered the chicken Sandwich and hers was all batter and very little chicken.  We showed this to the waiter who said he would pass this onto management.

I will not be visiting this restaurant again and urge management at this restaurant to take a hard look at this operation - because as is - with poor service and sub- par fast food sold at premium restaurant prices this location won't last a year in Toronto's competitive food industry."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Well composed dishes. The negative is I don't understand why the owners allow to run this place like a road house. From the way the waitress talks to her guests to over hearing conversations from the servers and all the kitchen staff. YELLING \"hands\" across the restaurant. This place can be so much better than that."}
{"text":"Went for Winterlicious with 4 of my pals.
One of us had to send back 2 things - the drink had a bug in it. And the dessert cup was filthy.
The mushroom artichoke soup for appetizer was very good. And I heard that the mushroom agnolotti was good too - but could have used a piece of bread on the side to sop up the sauce at the end.
My beef au jus was cold. It was probably sitting out for a while while they prepared the other entrees. Plus it didn't come with any fries which was a letdown. And didn't have enough horseradish sauce.
We waited a loooong time for our entrees to come. And eventually had to ask a server about it. Might have been due to the large group that was there for a retirement party. Still, there are other customers to serve!
The desserts were nothing to rave about either.
Ambiance is really nice. Modern, interesting decor. The washrooms are pretty cool.
The servers were friendly enough, but overall, it could have been a much better experience."}
{"text":"My sister told me that Origin was well known for their delicious brunches, so we made a trip there to see if this was the case. 
Origin is pretty new in our area and is very large, but nicely decorated. My only comment would be the washrooms, which feature communal sinks, the kind you find in elementary schools, where you step on the thing at the bottom and water comes out all around. Besides not being very effective to quickly wash hands, it's also wasteful if you're the only one there. Strange concept. Throw back, but not necessarily one wants to remember during their brunch.  
Now onto the important part...the food and service.
Service started out alright and then immediately got very slow. It took some time to get our drink orders and then took a LONG time to get our actual orders. 
I ordered their French toast, my sister ordered tostada and my husband skipped brunch and ordered a meal they offered of a burger, fries covered in some chorizo and sauce and a float. I also ordered a side of bacon...and was told that they were out of bacon...which meant any orders that would have come with bacon were out entirely, or would be served without bacon. I'm sorry but a brunch restaurant without bacon? Even the waitress admitted it was ridiculous.
We also shared a plate of buscuits with their preserves. These were delicious.
Apparently my meal was the one that took the longest. The others got their food and we still waited for five minutes before mine came out. Who knew it would take so long to put a couple of pieces of bread on a plate and cover them with blueberry preserves?
My sister said her tostada was quite good. My French toast was nothing special. The toast was \"fancy\", rounded pieces, on top of each other with whipped cream and blueberries in between. The \"maple\" which was supposed to be on the plate (maple syrup I'm guessing) was barely present. Tasted like something I could have created with some ease.
My husband's dish was the best by far. His burger was juicy and this fries were great. The float was a little silly...this big, meaty burger and fries covered in more meat...paired with a cream soda float in pink and white layers. (Not insulting, we just got a laugh). 
Nothing was cheap and then we had to wait a long time again to get our bill and pay. This was all strange because the restaurant was not particularly busy.
Because the brunch itself didn't blow me away, food shortages and service, I'm not sure if I would bother with brunch again. Oliver and Bonicini in the actual mall has a much better brunch. I might try this again for lunch or dinner though."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday with a group for a birthday brunch.  I was really excited especially knowing this was Chef Claudio Aprile's restaurant.  The restaurant is large and beautiful with some outdoor patio seating.

The restaurant was busy when we arrived on a sunny afternoon with reservations.  Perhaps it was because we were a large group but service was slow to take our orders for drinks and food.  I ordered the eggs benny with pork with salad.  Surprisingly not very impressed.  Also, by the time our table received our food, the restaurant was practically empty.  For dessert I shared the Chocolate Crunch Bar with Huckleberry Sorbet.  The bar was nothing special;  the sorbet was nice.

Beautiful restaurant.  Overall, surprsingly disappointed.  Maybe dinner is better but I will not return."}
{"text":"3.5, super close to a 4. Went here for brunch on a Sunday. We had reservations and it didn't seem too busy. We were seated immediately.

Our waiter was nice but imho, was def more concerned and preoccupied w/ the larger party (birthday group) than his other tables. 

I had the Smoked Salmon Benedict w/ english muffin + poached eggs + hollandaise sauce + kale salad $18. So pricy imho. But it was definitely one of the BEST egg benes I've had. The salmon was very yummy and fresh too. I was pretty stuffed for almost the entire day! 

We also had the Crushed potato + sour cream + scallion + maple bacon. That was just average. Honestly you can make this yourself at home :) 

The decor is nice but from the outside, I honestly thought it was just another place to overcharge yuppies and rich folks. A great restaurant for brunch once in a while. Lots of parking."}
{"text":"I went here for Winterlicious dinner. To start, I asked our server about the saffron rice cake and his reply was \"It's a cake of rice and the shrimps go on top\". I had no further questions for him afterwards. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed he was new.

The charred octopus was decent. A nice light starter with a hint of mint that added very well to the dish. The braised beef was terribly bland. It was very easy to pull apart. I didn't use my knife at all. But it had absolutely no flavour. Dessert was apple pie spring roll, which had potential, but was so poorly executed. Soggy and topped with... You guessed it. Cotton candy. Wait, what? I love cotton candy, but it added absolutely no value and was probably used to make the tiny, two bite dessert look less plain. 

They're very small portions. We went to eat ramen for dinner afterwards. 

TL;DR - I would have been more content with $45 worth of McDonalds."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, considering I am a big fan of Origin on King.

Unfortunately, my experience here has left a bad taste in my mouth, literally! But the experience overall is what brought this down to 2 stars.

To be proactive for what I thought would be a busy night for them, I attempted to make reservations for Friday at 6:30 p.m. so our party of 4 had enough time to get to the restaurant after work (yay for the 401). To my disappointment, the girl on the phone told me they could only take us at 6:00 p.m. or 8:00 p.m. We opted for the 6:00 p.m. reservation, all scrambling to leave work on time to make it for our reservation. When we arrived, the restaurant was EMPTY. I politely followed up with our server who told me that a manager would follow up with me - never did - even after I followed up twice. Needless to say, the restaurant never filled up the entire time we were there (max 6 tables occupied).

It was apparent that there was no management presence. The service was awkward, slow and extremely unorganized. Our food came out at different times from 3 different servers within a 15 minute time span - long enough for my dish to get cold while waiting for everyone else's to arrive. Not the kind of service you would expect for a restaurant that charges their guests the kind of prices that they do. 

As for the food:
1) Deviled Eggs: these come in portions of 3 and since there were 4 of us we asked if we could have an extra half egg. They charged us $4 extra. Something I may have overlooked if they were as delicious as they sounded but to my dismay, they were no better than day old eggs with a bit of paprika sprinkled on them.
2) Spanish Fries: soggy and basically eating fries with chunks of olive and olive juice. No hint of chorizo whatsoever, as stated on the menu.
3) NYC Tenderloin: I was not asked \"how would you like your steak?\" and as a result, my tenderloin arrived well done (hard as a rock) in a mishmash of a salty garlic sauce. Not worth the $33. 

The restaurant itself is beautiful. Very spacious, gorgeous light fixtures, nice ambience and a great patio. I hope that this place will work out the operational kinks and hire the right people to execute to the same standard as Origin on King."}
{"text":"Sorry - i just don't buy it.

When the Jarvis location opened up, it had a certain charm and draw to it. It was a trendy spot to be within one month. The food wasn't bad, the drinks were good, the service was nice, and the ppl were great.

Origin North, and the Liberty location is them just taking this too far.

Origin does not have what it takes to have multiple locations this quick.

The new menu is really confused - asian influenced with blatant american and italian dishes in the same stroke. Go down the menu from truffle popcorn to shanghai wings.
When you're eating tapas style, it's really strange going through so many stark flavour profiles. They're not even trying - it's not even disguised behind fusion. And if there's going to be an Asian focus on the menu, it better be done right - yeah not so much. It literally feels like you're eating at Jack Astor's.

Service wise, we're talking highly disorganized, slow pace and lazy servers. Their excuse is \"timing and flavour profiling of the meal is done for you\". Yeah when i have shanghai chicken wings and ravioli in the same course, i'm not quite sure how that works out.  And not to mention the two times that i have gone, the servers have ben awful.


This place is trying wayyy to hard."}
{"text":"Over priced, no one there food not good. Warm bottled beer.  I wouldn't go back restaurants in shops at Don mills much better."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful environment. Honestly, the washroom made me think back to highschool. (LOL) The food was great, especially the bufala mozzarella. Dessert was another story, very nostalgic. Entertaining to say the least. Making our ice cream at our table with liquid nitrogen. I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Dined in Wednesday in the patio and enjoyed their raw tuna salad with cucumbers, avocados and seaweed. Mixed in their vinaigrette dressing that was dramatically putting an end to another short lived summer in Toronto. My friend had the steak which he enjoyed with his Shirley Temple.

Crushed potatoes were also very yum. They had big portions of fries and I looooove fries! Nothing no one can do to screw this up for me, for even when served bland, salt n pepper or simple ketchup can accentuate the nom nom experience to make it more than a side dish to my Sapporo beer served perfectly cold.

Our server was fantastic!!!!! She was our bartender/server/hostess and super accommodating. The service definitely made up for the lack luster welcome we received from the female hostess at the entrance. Desperate to punch out and ready to flip the bird to end her daily grind misery as we were lead by a zombie to our table. Patio weather made up for the doomed intro thankfully!

The washrooms were located downstairs which had me relieved I picked the flats over the heels. Very dimly lit and washing my hands brought me back to elementary days... Literally, with their circular, multiple snout, one step on the foot bar/pedal away from a mini waterfall to cleaner hands. Weird concept, but a nice place to have a drink. The bar looks pretty neat."}
{"text":"Food was hit and miss. Some were good others were expensive and not good (eggplant). The desserts were excellent. Overall good food but not quite worth the high price you pay."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of Oliver and Bonacini's across the street, but I would choose this place over that one, in terms of food at least. Service is a different story.

Decor is very open and bright. Definitely a nice place to enjoy your meal during the spring/summer months. Very sophisticated and modern setting, simple and not flashy but casual and relaxing. Staff, though, might either be a little too occupied, or understaffed. Just kind of difficult to wave down our server at times.

Food, though, took A WHILE to arrive, to the point I thought they forgot our order. It was, however, worth the wait. Food presentation was lovely and prettily garnished. Ordered their Origin burger combo with spanish fries and cream soda float, and everything was YUM. Burger was not dry or overly salty, portion was just right.. A nice twist on the fries too paired with the float, though I was not expecting that bright of a shade of pink for the float. The overall food presentation was spot on at this place and the flavours were nice, not overly heavy or salty. Only flaw was service in my opinion.

Would visit again for their dinner menu."}
{"text":"This was the first time going to this Restaurant. 
My wife and I were excited to go out for Valentine's Evening, but the reception right from the Hostess was appalling.
She took us to a table for two by the entrance way and said we could only stay till 9:45 pm for our 8 pm reservation. We were stunned.
They then put us by the window, and they said there were heaters there but there were no heaters. We froze.
Then I asked for a 12 Oz steak and they were out. On a long weekend? So I settled for the little hamburger with fries. Another restaurant would have been better as the loaded meant \"with cheese\"
After ordering a burger /fry combo with a Caesar salad, and my wife a salmon on Bokchoi , and six oysters, my burger came without the fries before my salad and the oysters were not served before the mains.
The server mixed up the order sequence.
Overpriced, limited offering, dry salmon. Disappointing."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my family Friday night. Made a reservation before and we were seated in a lovely circle booth in the back corner. 
We started with champagne then had some wine and beer for drinks. We ordered the devilled eggs $6 (only 3 pieces), Spicy Spanish fries $12, tuna hand roll $9, mushroom hand roll $9 (yummy!), fiore de latte mushroom $17 (not worth it, just 3 small bruschetta pieces), beet salad $13 (very pretty and tasty), Sparta salad $13, 1 lb of shanghai chicken wings $14 with a side of fries (price?), thai curried shrimp with naan bread $17, 2 orders of the origin burger, asked for one medium and one well done. the medium one was super rare so my sister let the server knew and he took it off the bill and offered to re-make it but she didn't really want it by then - the burger patty is thick so they have to probably just be aware of that when cooking
other than that, service was good and the atmosphere was nice. prices are a little high for the quantity of food though
overall nice restaurant will return"}
{"text":"Not impressive, the environment is nice and comfortable, food is not as good as I expected, portion is too small for the price we pay. Ordered  seared salmon and beef tenderloin, salmon was way over cooked, tasted burned, had to request to make a new one, there is only two very small prices bf slice (other grill and bar would only charge half of the price), bf tastes ok. Safe to say I would not come back."}
{"text":"Impressive space, very spacious! We had an amazing waitress who tended our every need and constantly replenished our half empty water glasses.

Overall, the food was good but not as impressive as how people say:

Spicy Spanish Fries:
Crispy fries, but not spicy at all and had a strong olive flavour. I didn't really get any chorizo.

Bufalo Mozzarella:
Strong rosemary flavour, good balance of sweet honey taste and pillowy mozzarella with crunches of pine nuts - recommend

Bangkok Beef Salad:
Tender beef with crunchy peanuts and good balance of tartness (reminded me of a viet bun) - recommend

Beet Salad:
A whole beet displayed at centre of the plate, accompanied with goat cheese, greens and candied walnuts (goat cheese a bit salty).

Curried Shrimp with Naan:
Shrimps were perfectly cooked, accompanied with soft chickpeas and diced tomatoes and crunchy cucumber. The sauce tasted exactly like Tom Yum which is something I love (comes with 4 shrimps) - recommend

Fried Calamari:
Tender fried calamari with sweet julienned pineapples and mangoes. If you like something sweet and crispy then I would recommend it!

Second Rush:
A delightful way to end a meal, very whimsical - recommend for the fun factor!"}
{"text":"Nice decor but no music playing which affected the atmosphere. Service was painfully slow, meals came out at different times and were mediocre when they did arrive, cold $5 lattes.. Really disappointed because it was expensive and looked great. Take your money somewhere else (like the Oliver and Bonacini across the street)."}
{"text":"Perplexed by the lack of service at Origin North. Our waitress was very attentive at first but then we did not see her for the rest of the meal. Our hostess was the one who refilled our water, and after waiting an hour between our appetizers (Salmon Sushi Pizza, Hand Roll Cone, Watermelon Salad + Truffle Mushroom Burrata), our mains had not arrived. For this, we did get complimentary desserts (Nitrogen oxide ice-cream). Overall, our meal took 4 hours, and we left feeling tired and ignored. As much as I love Claudio on Masterchef, not sure if the restaurant empire is working so well for him!"}
{"text":"This review is based on my Summerlicious 2014 Dinner experience.

I decided for Summerlicious 2014, I would go to Origin North again since my experience was just so awesome! And it ended up to be a big mistake!

I know I could not expect too much for $25. But most of the items I ordered were a miss more than a hit. 

App: (Great Flavours though small portion at least they tasted good!)

Calamari with chipotle aioli + lemon
Watermelon Salad with cucumber + mint + basil + feta

Main: (Both were BAD! Just tasted awful!)

Chicken Breast with potato + corn + tomato ragout
Caramelized Eggplant + Miso+ ginger + squash_tofu + soy vinaigrette
( Eggplant tasted so bad as I almost want to throw up eating it, maybe I should have ordered the burger?)

Dessert: (Portion was really small.. like a tablespoon of ice cream? but both tasted ok)

Strawberries & Cream with shortbread
Passion Fruit Parfait with coconut + frozen yogurt + pizelle

Wine pairing now is $17.50 for dinner which I decided to pass. 

I still having nightmare about those eggplant... and I kind of glad it was just 2 little piece. 

I don't know if I would be coming back!! 

PS The menu online for Summerlicious 2014 is different from the actual menu when I was there... How come Steak frites becomes Burger?!! I just so confused!"}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks ago after seeing the long, long wait at O&B in Yorkdale.

The restaurant had a ton of open tables - at least a quarter of the restaurant was empty tables - but we were made to wait 15 minutes for things to \"clear up\", as I guess those empty tables were for a reservation. 

I was with a friend and we really didn't have any idea as to what the food was - we knew it was \"fusion\", but not much else beyond that. 

Our waitress was extremely nice - she explained the concept of the restaurant (fusion, multiple cooking stations, it comes out when ready, everything is meant for sharing). We ordered 3 things - a beet salad, guacamole, and the third I can't entirely remember at this point (was vegetarian, whatever it was). They were all fantastic. Portion sizes were quite large, as well.

The only thing I didn't like about the experience was the service - we had a nice waitress at first, but eventually we had two or three people serving our table in a seemingly uncoordinated manner as they didn't know the other servers were working our table, as well. At the end, I didn't really know who I was tipping which was a but awkward.

Would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast i have ever had. All the flavours were very unique. I went here for valentines day and it felt so fancy and enjoyable. The blueberry duck confit french toast was interesting. The flavour combination was something I would never have thought of. It was worth every single penny!!! Even though it was pricey at $21, I enjoyed every single bite and would pay for it again...

The origin brunch burger was very ordinary and was not as good as the french toast but was still extremely tasty. It was not worth the price of $17... However, do not get the fresh orange juice. It was so expensive and came in the smallest glass."}
{"text":"I was quite disappointed with the lack of value (per dollar) that I received at Origin North. We came here with some friends for dinner, and I was quite excited having seen this restaurant featured in a very popular television show. I didn't read the Yelp reviews ahead of time so I walked in with an unbiased opinion.

We ordered the calamari ($17) and the Spanish ham crostini ($16) to share. The calamari was good, but there were about 12 pieces of calamari in total. The crostini was also very good. None of the appetizers were amazing, and definitely didn't deserve the steep price point.

I ordered the fish tacos ($17), and my partner ordered the Thai curried shrimp ($19). The fish tacos were tasty for sure. I've had similar style and just as tasty fish tacos from a food truck before. You get 2 small fish tacos. Needless to say I was still hungry when I left Origin North. The Thai curried shrimp comes with 4 shrimps.

For dessert, we ordered the second rush ($14), which is a \"dessert tour\" of maple cotton candy, a truffle on a stick, a cheesecake in an extremely small ramekin, and a soft chocolate cookie.

The service was great, but the amount of food you get for the price you pay is disappointing. I ate some more food when I arrived at home. Spend your money elsewhere because you're not missing anything."}
{"text":"FYI I absolutely love fusion food

For dinner I came with my bf and ordered the beef carpaccio, bangkok beef salad, seared chicken breast, second rush, white sangria and purple haze.

Breakdown of my meal:
-the purple haze was so strong! I felt like a wham bam wave of alcohol slam me from behind but the alcoholic in me just kept the juices flowing and my consciousness waning.
-sangria was good as I appreciated that through the sweet/fruitiness I could still taste the white wine, which most sangria drinks elsewhere cannot promise to deliver.
-bangkok beef salad: the beef was seared well, albeit a little too chewy but had good meat flavour. the glass noodles were undercooked and the residual dressing made it too wet and sloppy.
- I usually like beef carpaccio chilled just so it doesn't taste like muck given its pasty texture, but this one was warm so it was mucky. The truffle was very effective in really elevating the aroma and taste of the dish, while the crudo was refreshing without feeling too sour.
-seared chicken breast reminded me of airplane meals given its conservative presentation/combination but the chicken was perfectly cooked to give a consistent texture throughout the entire animal ligament. The orzo was adequately flavored with proportionate sauce placement. 
-second rush was really underwhelming given the maple cotton candy, chocolate truffle, cheesecake and sparkle cookie was just plain old cotton candy, truffle, cake and cookie (where was the sparkle?)

Overall: I sat at the outdoor patio on a warm summer night. The seating and design of the wooden \"booths\" were very well thought out and it contributed to a private yet welcoming layout. My waiter was pretty cute too so, yeah."}
{"text":"Worst dine in experience ever, waited 10 min at the door for the host , waited 15 min at the table for a server, and decided to leave the restaurant. A restaurant can not just survive with the decor inside, really really really disappointed at the service."}
{"text":"I came here for Summerlicious since I previously had good experiences at this restaurant ($25 for dinner).

For starter, we all ordered the crispy calamari with caramelized peanuts, pineapple, mango, and shredded vegetables. There weren't a lot of calamari but the veggies were refreshing, and overall it was very appetizing.

Then there was a long gap before our main course arrived. I ordered the caramalized eggplant with miso, ginger, squash, tofu, and soy vinaigrette. The soy vinaigrette was way too salty and overwhelmed my palate. To me, this wasn't a very successful fusion dish. My bf got the burger, which wasn't as good as I remember it to be when I ordered it a la carte. The best choice was definitely the herb roasted chicken breast with smoked potato, corn, and tomato ragout. The chicken was extremely tender and juicy.

For dessert, I had strawberries & cream with shortbread. It was an elevated version of a strawberry sundae. Yum! The other desserts were not nearly as good. I was told that the donut was underwhelming, and the passion fruit parfait was a little too sour for my taste.

Overall, I thought my a la carte experience here was a lot better, and I probably would not come back for Summerlicious."}
{"text":"The food was okay but lacklustr for the price.

Good dishes-

The salmon tartare was amazing but it only came with 4 (delicious taro) chips to scoop it with.

The mushroom soup was decent but my bf crunched in to sand (they must use dehydrated mushrooms which need careful handling to ensure no dirt remains after soaking).

Boring dishes-

Lamb shank Vindaloo. The meat was tender but a lacking in seasoning- it should have just been called lamb shank but not vindaloo. 

Linguini Alfredo was boring, tasteless and quite frankly a waste of calories. 

I wouldn't return."}
