{"text":"Wow! The Old Brooklyn Cheese Company opened it's doors to the public today. An amazing selection of gourmet cheeses from France, Italy and OHIO with charcuterie, jams, olives and fresh baguettes. The prices are very reasonable and the selection is incredible. The friendly welcoming staff is also knowledgeable and there are endless trays of cheese for sampling. They will be also offering their own homemade cheese in the spring."}
{"text":"My review is obviously biased because we are family!  If you want an amazing selection of cheese and other local goodies, with people who are super passionate and knowledgeable, then you need look no further.  Always fun samples, plus I was really impressed by the vibe.  I wanted to linger over my cheese board.  Unfortunately my 3 year old kept trying to run behind the counter.  Still had a great time and loved our selections. ;) Highly recommend them for a pre or post dinner stop!  Cant wait to fill out our cheese passport!!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! So many local items and not just the cheese. Morgan was so nice and full of knowledge. I was offered samples of everything I was interested in and I was given a background of all the items as well. I will definitely be back and will pass the word on about this place."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Super knowledgeable and professional. Very affordable artisinal foods. They have a clear passion for what they're doing!"}
{"text":"As an Old Brooklyn native, I'm so happy to see all of the development in the past few years! I really enjoyed visiting Old Brooklyn Cheese Company. The cheesemaker guided us through their vast selection and we left with some awesome cheeses. He let us have as many samples as we wanted and seemed genuinely passionate about his work.  In addition to cheese, they offer lots of local specialties including baguettes, spreads, and beverages."}
{"text":"I saw a picture of a fancy delicious looking cheese platter on Yelp and immediately wanted to come to Old Brooklyn Cheese Company. I showed up on a Saturday afternoon and what I found was a simple cheese shop with an owner who is very passionate and knowledgeable about his cheeses.    My friend ordered a sandwich and from what I gathered about their experience was that the sandwich was okay/good, but that the panini pressed bread was so hard it tore up the roof of their mouth.   I ordered a 3 cheese board ($15) and was given a sampling of a 4th cheese on the house. This board was beautiful. Chunks of cheese paired with jams, mustards, fruits, nuts, honey, olive oil, and a basket of sliced bread. They don't write down what cheese you selected so from memory I think I got a cheese with peppercorns, some caramely cheese, and two bries... I think. The one that was melted I loved, but really I thought they were all good and ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning. (Maybe write the names of the cheese down so if the customer likes it they can order more if they come back?).  We brought in our own bottles of water to drink.  Staff was definitely full of character and personable. They have no problem with letting you sample what they have to offer (be wary of the rattlesnake cheese, packs some heat!). The owner chatted with us for a bit which is something I always enjoy because it puts a face behind the name, lets you learn more about the product/vision, and it allows you to establish a positive connection to the business.  Another great thing about this business is that they are very local. By that I mean they sell cheese created in-house, locally, and from other countries; some local pickles (Randy's Pickles); some local bread (Blackbird); some local jams (Cleveland Jam) and meats (Europa Charcuterie); and beverages (Old City Soda). So it's a wonderful place if you need to pick up cheese and want to support a local shop who sells other locally made items that pair well with the cheese. It's also a wonderful shop if you have money to spend to impress your work or other groups of people ($100 cheese platters), because these platters are fabulous. Way better than your standard Giant Eagle fair.   So why 4 stars instead of 5? Because while I enjoyed my experience, I still felt like something was missing. I couldn't think of a reason to come back soon. I'm not at sugar mama status just yet so I can't afford to purchase the large platters for social occasions. I'm also solo so buying blocks of cheese, a large tube of cured meat, or even a whole baguette is not something I do. That stuff would go bad faster than I could snack on it. And while I know some places around Cleveland offer BYOB, that's illegal and Old Brooklyn is not even gonna risk it so no wine to pair with that cheese.   If Old Brooklyn Cheese Company sold wine and offered wine tastings in the future I would 100% support them. As a young professional I enjoy a place I can meet up with friends or dates after work and enjoy a lovely cheese board and a drink. Down the road I think I'd come in for a 3 cheese board again (or a meat and cheese board if they have it?), I'd just get it to-go and assemble at home for better enjoyment. Otherwise if you don't care about selecting your own cheeses I heard that Vino Veritas is a new winery right down the road that sells little cheese boards from Old Brooklyn (this might be more of what I'm looking for).   Lastly, as we were paying our bills, my friend was told they didn't have to tip but the staff member awkwardly watched the screen and asked if I was going to. I'd suggest turning the screen completely away and taking a step back so the customer can decide about gratuity without the staffs influence.   I encourage you to check this place out and decide for yourself!"}
{"text":"We had seen this cute storefront numerous times but it normally closes at 5:00.  Lucky for us, it was open until 7:00pm on Friday so we walked over to check it out.  We were so pleasantly surprised!  Although they serve some sandwiches, as the name would suggest, this is a real bona fide cheese shop and that's their specialty.  Michael, the owner and one of two cheese-makers in Cleveland encouraged us to learn about and try different cheeses, especially his own delicious cheeses.  At his prompting, we were quickly sold on a $15 mixed meat, cheese and lots of little extras, including his homemade mustard, in a to-go box.  He and Maria were extremely nice and knowledgeable able cheeses and also gave recommendations for other great places and things to do in our neighborhood.  We are sold!  This is our favorite cheese shop hands down!"}
{"text":"If you are a cheese lover, the Old Brooklyn Cheese Company is a Must Do! Not only are the owners and staff friendly and extremely knowledgable, the cheese selection is some of the best in town.  Be sure to take advantage of the samples - you will surely find a new favorite. Always ask about the house made cheese for a real treat.  They recently collaborated with Collision Bend Brewing Co and now offer homemade Spicy IPA mustard that goes is so good with cheese or on a sandwich sandwich. The other local non-cheese products are thoughtfully curated and the perfect additions to your cheese board.  Order a Special Order platter or even a cake made of cheese for a special occasion. I highly recommend that you visit and taste the awesomeness for yourself!"}
{"text":"Very nice and knowledgeable staff.  We told them what we liked and asked for suggestions and the owner gave us a fantastic 30 minute tasting tour.  Lots of local as well as iconic cheeses were there (and olives, jams, charcouterie).  Additionally, they make their own cheeses.  We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a fantastic little find! Talk about knowledge, these people understand their cheeses and are not shy to tell you all about them! We had a 3 cheeses plate to eat at the store and left it up to them to pick. We got Lake Erie Goat Perls, Kokoborrego Headwaters and Mayfield Creamery Siberian Night (all 3 were awesome).  Definetly pay these guys a visit, you will not regret it. They have over 50 different cheeses at all times and are more than welcome to give you tastes in case you wanna try something specific. The majority are from local producers which gives you another reason to buy from them, support your local business!!! They also have meats (Charcuterie), Coffee, Pickles and Locally made Condiments! We will definitely be coming back and try more different varieties!!!l"}
{"text":"nice fit for a 1890s building. Clean design with artisan touches. Good selection (not overwhelming) and helpful owners. Great place to expand you cheese literacy. FYI parking in rear."}
{"text":"I'm so embarrassed it took me this long to review here. BOOKMARK THIS SPOT NOW!  I love OBCC. If you're a cheese connoisseur or a casual cheese nibbler, you'll love it here. My colleague and I popped in about 12 noon and to our delight, we were the only ones in and had free reign of the shop (what luck). Morgan, one of their fromagers, was super helpful. She let me try several samples and walked me through suggestions based on my taste. I tried their 4 housemade cheeses, all which were excellent, and Morgan was very patient. They have sprawling cases of cheeses from both CLE, in-house and out of house.   The interior is so charming, welcoming and hip. They also carry walls of local products ranging from Cleveland Pickle to Old City Soda and their own mustard collaboration with Collision Bend Brewing. I purchased 2 cheeses for myself (the Grayson and the in-house Honey Goat Cheese) and their housemade tostinos. My total was only $11. I had to do a double take! This would be double that at some other establishments. The Old Brooklyn Cheese Company is a wonderful place beaming with local pride, amazing cheese, affordable prices and friendly people. I will absolutely be back and I hope to try one of their special order platters in the future for a party."}
{"text":"Love this place! Stopped by last week on national grilled cheese day for the special melted  raclette and prosciutto sandwich with speciality mustard and pickles it was delicious... loved every bite.  Everyone there is so friendly and knowledgeable about everything cheese and meat related... have not steered me wrong yet.   Will be back soon for another cheese and meat fix."}
{"text":"As a resident of Old Brooklyn, I couldn't be more thrilled for the addition of The Old Brooklyn Cheese Company! But you don't have to be a local to enjoy this gem, it's worth a drive no matter what area of Greater Cleveland you're in.   They officially opened their doors this weekend, but I knew I wanted to miss the crowds because I truly know nothing about cheese and definitely knew I was going to need some help picking out some goodies. Like, lots of help. I'm pretty sure the fanciest cheese I've bought myself outside of anything that was pre-picked by a chef as a charcuterie board was from Trader Joe's.  Obviously I came to the right place, the owner was happy to help me pick out everything I needed in the price range I gave him, and letting me sample everything along the way. The only negative thing I have to say is that I wish I didn't sample anything, because it was all delicious and my purchase was for a gift basket that I now have to keep my paws off, knowing how good everything is. I cannot wait to go back and grab some for myself!   Everything is really reasonably priced, I wasn't sure what to expect given my inexperience to finer cheeses. I was able to grab a half pound of two wonderfully delicious cheeses, a couple of locally made jams, a nice sausage stick, some crackers, and a big jar of locally made egg nog all for right around $40. Seriously, the cheese is delicious too."}
{"text":"I love cheese experiences like this. You know, the kind where you step into the shop and the staff is thrilled to tell you about the product and sample and give you recommendations to pair with each of the cheeses. Located in the Old Brooklyn neighborhood, this cheese shop offers an interior with wooden floors, large communal tables in the front for guests to chow on their sandwiches and cheese boards, and several cases filled with cheeses sourced throughout the Midwest, international as well as at least 4-5 cheeses made in-house (technically in the cellar below the upstairs store.) Despite my not feeling well and not ready to purchase a bunch of cheese, my coworker picked up a few items and I was super impressed by the price point. For two cheeses and a bag of crostini her total was only $10! What a steal! I can't wait to visit the next time I'm in town. If you are looking to build a full cheeseboard, they offer a wall of accoutrements like mustards, olives, honey, bread and anything else you can think of. I also noticed that they offer events throughout the month like painting and cheese pairings. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the Old Brooklyn neighborhood!"}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for some fun cheese for a wine and cheese party at Christmas. We had never been here before - they had  just opened last weekend so many of us are just learning about them. I was completely impressed. Michael walked us through the various cheese in the cases, let us sample about 16 different cheeses, and made great recommendations for us. We bought 6 different types at very reasonable prices. It truly was a pleasure to spend time there. The one non-cheese purchase that we made was a baguette from the Black Bird Bakery for dinner tonight.  The Old Brooklyn Cheese Company has large baskets of baguette for their customers convenience. Check this place out - very helpful and friendly folks who know their cheese."}
{"text":"Excellent selection, extremely helpful and friendly staff.  We were a little lost making our selections and they were super patient and cool about it.  All their suggestions were spot on!"}
{"text":"Great little business with a cool vibe. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable and enthusiastic about cheese, as they should be. The owner is wonderful and his enthusiasm for his house made cheese is contagious.  Great selection of imported and house made selections. They carry a nice assortment of locally sourced food accompaniments as well. Love that they can describe every cheese perfectly and allow you to taste anything before buying. My husband is more into cheese than I am but I admit I've   discovered some new favorites from coming with him here. They carry a cute cheese passport to write down your favorites which for me is a fun way to make sure you can remember the names.  A little seating area in the front is a nice place to sit and enjoy a sampling of cheeses or a sandwich.   The Mahon and Jeff's select Gouda are my favorites. My husband loves the soft choices and always orders the goat cheese blend of the day, with the honey walnut being his favorite.   A must stop for any cheese lover. You will become a cheese connoisseur."}
{"text":"I stop by every week, often, twice a week, so I guess you can call me a regular. There is something new almost every time I shop. More and more local products appear every week. Michael's own made-downstairs-in-a-cheese-cave-dug-by-hand-using toy-shovels cheeses are sublime."}
{"text":"Amazing cheese selection and staff to match. You can truly tell that the staff are as enthusiastic about cheese as the cheese is delicious. I needed two cheese platter for a work event. I was able to sample a wide variety of cheese and not only got to take a flavor adventure, I also learned about the cheese making process.  The staff was able to make my idea come to life (all local cheese and meats) and even called me to make sure it was ok to trade a cheese out that was not ready and then described the new cheese choice to me. It was an extremely pleasant experience and the final boards were gorgeous!  The relationships they have with local cheese companies makes for even better options.  The in-house mustard and goat cheese mixes are to die for! ALWAYS ask for what they have made in house, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Cute little store! I stopped in and got to try a bunch of jams and mustards that they make. All were really delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Michael the owner and his fiancé Angie were very nice. Morgan was. Very knowledgeable and a great personality. The cheese being sold here is awesome. Numerous of Ohio selection of cheeses and cheeses from afar also. Stop in and sample some."}
{"text":"It is a dream come true to have a cheese shop like this open up right around the corner! The store itself is tiny but offers a wide range of different cheeses, pickles, and smoked meats. The staff is extremely knowledgeable and will offer as many samples as you like. It is my own personal cheese heaven! All of them were able to ask what type of flavor or cheese I enjoyed and offered some amazing suggestions. They also have a jar of little surprise samples for a dollar. It is wrapped up without knowing what you are going to open. A nice little surprise to pick up and a good way of trying a new cheese each time. They also offer in house sandwiches that seem to switch out daily. This is an absolutely charming addition to Old Brooklyn and I would strongly recommend a stop in here."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for a legit cheese shop to open around here (not in the west side market either) and my prayers have been answered.  This shop is stocked with an impressive selection of local, imported, artisanal cheeses and other food items. We also love their sandwiches.  You can sample anything you want, order any amount you want, the staff is AMAZING and I have had some really delicious cheese from them.   I can't stress enough-- you just have to stop in for yourself and take a few things home!"}
