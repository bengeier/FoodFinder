{"text":"Best new restaurant in the CU area. We ordered the wheelhouse burger, the Cuban Reuben, and the Cobb Salad. All of them were beautifully cooked. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Dined there with friends and family on Thursday, June 8.  We were very happy with the meal -- another nice place for the rotation, if a bit far from Champaign & Mahomet where we live.  But it was worth the drive and we will be going back.  Pros:  - cheese curds very good, would have ordered more if I had the metabolism  - good salads, fresh greens  - excellent entrees: risotto, spaghetti, chicken breast.  everything looked interesting  - nice decor, like upscale barn?  whatever it was, it worked well  - friendly staff  - had a nice Sicilian wine by the bottle -- forget the name.  was quite inexpensive.  Overall, wine markups seem very fair.  - the bathroom was clean.  it matters -- not always the case  - very very easy parking  Cons:  - cocktails not well mixed.  mint julep and templeton rye old fashioned.  i don't think we were shorted on the rye, but the drink felt weak or maybe lacking in flavor from other ingredients  - menu a bit small.  Since we don't live in St. Joe, we probably won't be going there more than once every couple months, but if we were, we'd like to see a larger list  - draft beer list admirably local, but only four.  Would like to see more, but we had wine and cocktails that night and the draft selection did not factor into the star rating  - a few more wine options would be nice  Unsure:  - dessert: strawberry cake was nice, tea cake seemed not fully cooked  Summary: Very happy to see a new serious restaurant in Champaign (county).  Good crowd on a Thursday, seems like a great start.  If I could ask for one thing: I'd ask for two.  Better cocktails and a few more menu options.  If there are always entree specials, that would be good enough.  I would try everything on the current menu, so I won't be running out soon.  Oh, and a larger wine list or -- do you allow brought in wine for a corkage fee?  Good luck!"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing dinner, dessert and beer selection. Must try the fettuccini and don't leave without chocolate mousse and donut!!! Already made reservations for the weekend. Excellent service made the night."}
{"text":"The Wheelhouse is a new restaurant that hasn't even had it's official grand opening, yet they are quickly becoming one of many folks favorite restaurant myself included. It's located directly off of the soon to be open bike path that will run from Champaign through St. Joseph and beyond. They feature uniquely crafted items made with local fresh ingredients. The chefs creativity and culinary flair shine through in all of the treats featured on this simple menu. The homemade green ketchup,  is full of zest and stylishly a lovely alternative to the plain red ketchup that I am used to. I  chose a delicious handcrafted hamburger consisting of two beef patties that melted in my mouth. It was topped with carmelized onoins, palmetto cheese, and various other deliciousness. It created a wonderful flavor combination and was perfectly prepared. The server mentioned they serve green Bloody Mary's! How different and fun does that sound! I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This place was everything I hoped it would be.  The very definition of farm-to-fork w/ local ingredients and creative/delicious recipes.  We made a full meal out of it (drinks, appetizers, entrees, and dessert) and were impressed from start to finish.  The staff was also very attentive and friendly.  We'll 100% be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. I was intrigued by the menu on their Facebook page and 6 of us tried it out on a Saturday night. They hit the mark on numerous fronts and considering they haven't been open for very long the execution is something even established restaurants should model. Even the innocuous sounding chicken entree is something special and very tasty. The Porchetta entree which I ordered was very very good.   Highlights: Appetizers: Lamb/beef meatballs Cheese curds Duck 3 ways  Entrees Basted chicken Porchetta (pork) The burger Cuban Reuben  Drinks: Gin martini The Doty Chocolate mint julep  Dessert: Bread pudding with ice cream  Skip: Ravioli.   We are definitely planning a return visit."}
{"text":"This review is written from food and service experiences by four for dinner. The restaurant is hard for find; it's located in a blue building on the west side of Main Street. The atmosphere is comfortable, and there is a small bar area.  Cheese curds were ordered and good. For meals, a hamburger, smoking chicken, and 2 Cuban Ruebens were ordered. The hamburger was ordered well done, it arrived pink inside, though eatable since only a portion was wanted. The smoking chicken included a lot of lettuce, and the ruebens were ok - one commented the corned beef was not to his liking.   The service provided was odd. Sugar was requested, and a container of Splenda was given. Honey mustard was requested, and Dijon mustard was given (very diff sauces). We found this odd. When asking about real sugar, the waitress must have gotten offended. It wasn't easy to get; I didn't see her again except to slap our bill between us (one of the two couples). Non-tea [soda] drinkers were offered refills. The waitress thanked only one of the couples (the couple who did not ask for sugar or mustard). We felt for such a small request re sugar, the waitress could have easily made the dining experience better with little effort. I had higher hopes in this restaurant! The menu does not excite me enough to plan a return visit, and the service certainly doesn't."}
{"text":"Holy cow!!! You need to try this place!!! Flavor, Yes! Atmosphere, Yes! Great service, oh yes!"}
{"text":"We came in not sure what to expect and walked out with a new favorite place! 5 star food, 5 star ambience, 5 star wait staff and 5 star wine and beer options!  If you don't live in St. Joseph, it's well worth the drive. We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Really dug this place.  Nice balance to the menu to satisfy the meat and potatoes crowd whilst also including a bunch of seasonal, creative dishes.  The cookery was very solid and seasoned well.  The plating of the ramp appetizer and pork cutlet entree could have been more attractive...but ingredients and cooking will always trump plating. I will be back.  Great concept and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic.  We tried almost one of everything and will be going back to try the rest.  This is a 5 star restaurant in our backyard,  don't miss out."}
{"text":"We've been here twice already, once for dinner and once for brunch. The owner and wait staff are extremely friendly and the food is excellent. They have an excellent beer selection and unique house cocktails. The menu changes by the week, I can't wait to go back and try more things!"}
{"text":"Came here today to check it out, love the library ladder over the bar, could use more decor in the place. Quite cold from the windy fans but I'm ok with it. I had the burger. Looked nice. I like the house pickles on it. Good char flavor from the onions and bun. The fries are nicely done, LOVE the tomatillo ketchup. Daughter had grilled cheese. I tried it and was impressed it was creamy and very good. Black walnut cake is great, the walnut flavor came through awesomely. My better half had the Cuban Rueben. Nice concept and name. Could use more sauce and thicker bread. Corned beef seemed like it was done in house. Would like it to be more tender though. Great job guys I will return!"}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, homemade fries were really good. Cute little place with some creative menu items. Vintage glassware was a nice touch. Great find in a small town."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Executive chef Ryan knows his stuff and keeps the kitchen running well. It is a bit pricey to visit weekly, but it is well worth the occasional treat. It is the best dining experience in St. Joseph and among the best in Champaign County."}
{"text":"We have had the best time here! Our favorite dishes were the cheese curd appetizer, the shrimp and grits entree, and the vanilla bread pudding dessert! Amazing staff, delicious food, lovely decor. All around wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Great local place! Incredible quality,  inviting atmosphere, and fresh greens.  Conveniently located next to the Kickapoo trail that is being built. Definitely worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I just finished a spectacular farm-to-table meal at the wheelhouse. Chef Ryan and wife Abbie make a great duo. Abbie was very welcoming and hospitable and Ryan served up flavorful, great quality food. Fresh and new this week was asparagus and peas. So good!! The prices are a little steep but so worth it as the quality of food is top notch and the dishes are a culinary treat! Will definitely be returning to try new dishes and inviting others to come along."}
{"text":"You'll be delighted by this spot!  The food is A-maz-ing! I can't wait to go back to try everything on the menu. It was so hard to decide!!! It's great that this place is here to serve the community by using local growers."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great meals.  Rissato was excellent and the special tonight was BBQ pork with fries. Homemade roll was very good."}
{"text":"Jess cooked for us.  AMAZING  KAITLYNN was our server.  SUPER AWESOME  Good food.  Great atmosphere.  And super low price!!!   Come out of Champaign to experience this amazing place!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch, not impressed. Food took forever and we just got sandwiches. Pulled pork was passed its expiration! Not good. Got to get the basics down to be a good restaurant."}
{"text":"This bicycle-themed restaurant boasts local ingredients and a hipster menu. Located at the end of the Kickapoo Rail Trail, it's a great destination for a bike ride. However, there is no bike parking (even though it is bicycle-themed and at the terminus of a bike trail).  The farm-to-table menu evolves with what is available and in-season. We ordered the fried okra as our appetizer and were pleasantly surprised. It wasn't the breaded, deep-fried standard. Rather, it was delicately fried okra with a crispy cornmeal topping strewn with sesame seeds and green onions. This was followed by a burger since burgers are the litmus for me. It came well-seasoned but a little dry. I asked for medium-rare but received medium-well.   With only two samples, I found these menu offerings to be a hit or miss. I didn't have the stomach space or the change to try even more things on their menu. That will be reserved for another trip."}
{"text":"Husband and I went here for Date night tonight! Service was excellent, atmosphere was nice, and the food was amazing. I ordered the wheelhouse burger which was cooked perfectly and had wonderful flavors! The fries that came with the burger were just the right texture! My husband ordered the special which was a squid ink pasta with lobster and shrimp in a creamy sauce- absolutely to die for, it also came with grilled ciabatta bread. For dessert we ordered the Carmel apple pie with ice cream and lemon meringue- both hit the spot! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I would give the food here 4 stars. Wheelhouse praises themselves on using locally sourced food, which I guess is nice. We stopped for lunch and had the turkey wrap. Ingredients were good, however the large chunks of Kennekuk cheese were overwhelming. I like cheese and local cheese is good,but biting into large wads of cheese is a bit much.  I give this place 2 stars because of the remodeling going on outside. The building is designed to look like something out of the old wild west, but everything is ripped up, there is no sign for the restaurant or even signs indicating where the temporary entrance to the restaurant is. Perhaps some directional signage would be good to help customers locate your business...and a very new one at that!"}
{"text":"Yelp informed me about this new restaurant and hence I was curious to try this place. This place is situated at St. Joseph, about 12 mins drive from Champaign- Urbana. The place is very new ( a month old) and hence they do not have a restaurant sign board yet.. One needs to enter the building complex to access the restaurant to their left. At first the restaurant has very quirky yet very interesting decor.. there are bicycles hung everywhere. It's a small restaurant decorated very interestingly and has a great feel and ambience! Although we did not have reservation, we got seated very quickly! This place has a small bar and a very happy, refreshing environment! The menu is small but has some nice selections. Their farm to fresh concept is a real treat! Sadly they were out of Duck 3 ways- something I was eager to try! We tried their cheese curds and Smoking lamb.. both were very tasty and delicious. The lamb was very tender and the presentation was wonderful. I had the Wheelhouse burger- it had thin yet very filling patties with caramelized onion and fries! The burger tasted very good and their secret sauce did the magic to my taste buds! Loved the burger! My friend had the mushroom risotto which she loved it too.  Regarding the drinks- we really loved the selection of wines they had but was greatly put off to find that they had not chilled their wine (white). Sadly they even diluted one during serving.. This was a big put off as wine lovers but still I am considerate as they are just new in this business. Hopefully they will be better in their wine servings soon!The red wine (Malbec) was great and so was their beer selection. Luckily we happened to be on their first Trivia night.. this was amazing fun! They had 5 rounds of trivia and that made this dining experience real fun!  Their desserts were amazing.. (chocolate cheesecake and strawberry cake with lemon mousse) we loved it so much that we ended up ordering second time! The service was good and server (Jenny) was prompt and attentive. However the main course took a long time to be served but trivia night kept us busy! Overall we loved our dining experience and hope by our next time visit they would be up in their game! Amazing restaurant and hope to return soon!   Suggestions- You have awesome wine on the menu- please keep them chilled for wine lovers like us!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had a date night here a few weeks back. We'd been hearing good things for a long time but hadn't made it over yet. My only regret is it took us so long to try it! Our food was delicious, the portions were generous for the prices, and the service was good as well. The cheese curds are a must, and my stroganoff, the special that night, was perfectly seasoned. My husband's burger was delicious as well. We were stuffed but couldn't help splitting the pumpkin cheesecake which didn't disappoint either. We are expecting a baby soon so we probably won't have many chances to go for a while, but we will return as often as we can. Definitely worth the short drive, dinner for two of this caliber would run you $10-20 more in Champaign, easily."}
{"text":"Delicious! We love that the menu changes up so it's always new and exciting- we've only been once but will certainly be back whenever their menu is updated each time. Only recommendation is to have music playing- we arrived around 6:30 on a Saturday night and the dinner crowd hadn't set in just yet but without the music the mood was just a bit off. We will certainly be back though- the cheese curds are amazing and the tomatillo ketchup is delicious!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Green Bloody Mary...A+. Wheelhouse burger A++. We will definitely be coming back soon. Outstanding. Great addition to St. Joe!"}
{"text":"The service was phenomenal! Our server was very knowledgeable and steered us into delicious entrees. The menu isn't extensive, but it's modern, interesting and lives up to the descriptions.   The Wheelhouse offers great quality food for a fair price; drinks, small plate, salads and entrees all for $80. I couldn't be more pleased with my experience and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Hubs and I try really hard to only eat out at locally owned, Mom and Pop type restaurants/bars.  We are so excited to have another choice, especially since we live in St Joseph and went to school here.  The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming.  I love that they leave the bottle of water at your table.  The owners are wonderful and seem to really care about your satisfaction.  The wait staff are knowledgeable and attentive.  The food?  Well, it's darn good!  Our favorites are the Wheelhouse Burger, the cheese curds, which are made from Ludwigs cheese, 10 minutes east of us, and the fries with the tomatillo sauce/catsup.  There is no salt/pepper on the table because this food is freshly prepared and properly seasoned during cooking.  You don't need it and won't miss it.  But don't YOU miss a chance to have a nice meal, in a cute place, with great owners."}
{"text":"Advertised as \"Farm to Fork\" I would definitely drive to St. Joseph again to eat here. I had the eggs over easy and my husband had the French Toast. Both were delicious. The French toast was delightful, light and fluffy. As many ingredients as possible are from local sources. Since The Wheelhouse is new it is a little hard to find. Look for the board out front by the sidewalk. It is located by the new bicycle path so will be a great stop for cyclists but do go whether you bike or drive!"}
{"text":"Farm to table is not the norm in CU and the surrounding area, so what a surprise to find The Wheelhouse in St Joseph. They have been open less than two weeks at the time of this review, and I have to say, they have come up with great food options. I had the beef stew and it was absolutely fabulous. We had cheese curds, the Yukon gold fries with tomatillo catsup, and the duck three way, comprised of duck confit, duck egg, and sliced duck with sautéed greens. All three appetizers were excellent and the duck was un-DUCKING-believable!! My wife got the shrimp and grits and it was also excellent!  The bicycle theme is awfully inviting, and the waitstaff and the owners were attentive and friendly. They have kids meals and my three kiddos were jazzed with the meal.   They need a sign. They know that. They're working on it. They've been open two weeks. I'll cut them slack for that. All in all, they've given us a reason to travel to St Joe from CU. Trust me, just go."}
{"text":"If you live in the C-U area, you need to go here. All excellent quality local ingredients. This is what farm to table should be. As a Chicago transplant, I have been anxious to try this place, and it exceeded expectations.   We had the marinated cheese curds, the smoked lamb, and the beet salad for starters. The main entrees were the mushroom risotto and the burger. They have a \"green sauce\" that is a tomatillo based ketchup that is great! (They still have regular ketchup too if you want it). The atmosphere was great as well. The service was excellent also.  This place is located close to the new bike trail that will be connecting Urbana to Danville, which is the premise for the name and decor. It's truly a gem in Champaign county, and I'm looking forward to the next menu change. Thank you, Chef Rogiers!"}
{"text":"Great spot for food conveniently located just off the Kickapoo Rail Trail! Great decor with bikes decorating the walls and they use second hand glassware. Great selection of food and drink - especially considering you're all the way in St. Joseph. They're huge fans of tomatillos. They use it in lots of their dishes and their homemade \"ketchup\" is made from it too. If you like old school ketchup, you're probably not going to like it. It doesn't taste anything like ketchup. Since it's made from tomatillos, it's not as sweet and its pretty tangy. They also make a bloody mary from tomatillos. I also was a little disappointed because it didn't really taste like a bloody mary to me. I guess I love bloody marys because I love tomatoes and tomatillos are so different. The bloody mary wasn't as sweet, it was pretty tangy - almost sour. Anyhoo, if you're a tomato purist like me, steer clear of their signature dishes with tomatillos."}
{"text":"Absolutely Delicious! Exceeded all of our expectations. The herb marinated cheese curds w/ beer mustard were heavenly. The beef & lamb meatballs melted in my mouth with an explosion of smokiness and contrasted beautifully with the sweet potato purée.  I'm also somewhat of Cuban sandwich connoisseur and the Cuban Rueben is a must try! Also loved the juicy veggie bowl! My wife and I split our meals they were so good. Great ambiance, very friendly staff, and a killer IPA selection!  So many local farms supported too!!! Love It!!!"}
{"text":"Great food! Principle is him just a little bit of the tweak to them to be interesting, but not unfamiliar. The beet salad lambs out of this world. Service was super fast and the venue is comfortable and interesting! Loved it!"}
