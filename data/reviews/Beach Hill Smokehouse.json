{"text":"Had the beef rib and it was excellent. This is definitely one of the best barbecue places in the city. Worth the commute."}
{"text":"We found out about this Smokehouse through Yelp, and made the trip this weekend to sample their Smoked Goods! Mmm! Loved it!  The lineup to get served was quite long (1/3 of the way through the store), but the smoky scent wafting through the establishment had us drooling and distracted while we waited to be served.  We ordered a lot of items for take-out and they weighted them, wrapped them in butcher's paper, and packed them for us.  We couldn't wait to get home to sample their Smoked meats...  The Beef Brisket was awesome. 'Nuff said! It comes without any BBQ sauce, so you can add their house sauce if you want (we didn't).  The Side ribs were excellent (The PitBoss mentioned he wouldn't even think about doing Baby Back Ribs), but, I prefer Back Ribs. Nevertheless, the dry rub and and smoked flavour was heavenly. (again, no sauce, just dry rub and smoked, so you can enjoy it without any added sugar sauces)  Their home-made pork sausages were spiced just right! Mmm!  Cole Slaw was great. Not too much sugar, and a nice hint of jalapeño peppers mixed in! Didn't try the other sides, but, they looked great.  Service at the counter was fast and friendly. They take Cash, debit, and credit.  We found out they are licensed, and had a nice selection of craft beers available if you chose to dine in-house. We may try this the next time we visit."}
{"text":"This place has been open for 4 days and they were already selling out of mains at noon!!!  I was in a line 8 people deep when the weather was -20. We did takeout... large poblano coleslaw, large smoked baked beans and a whole chicken for under $30. This is the BEST BBQ I have had in the city. We are replacing easy family pizza dinner for the Smokehouse. I can't wait to go back.   Service is welcoming. And the place has a great feel."}
{"text":"What a great time. Excellent BBQ! My favourite was the brisket but also enjoyed the ribs, chicken and turkey. Beans were tasty with a good touch of spice and cilantro. Pretty fair Cole slaw. Plain white bread to mop things up, nothing special there.  Order in the back at counter where you can see your meat cut and weighed, then grab a picnic table. Beer coming in about a month. For now just pop and water. Extra BBQ sauce in large squeeze bottles and some peppers, onions and pickles as well. Exuberant friendly service from the owners sets a feel good atmosphere. They were sold out  of the sausage and I got the last chicken at 6pm! Didn't try the banana pudding. Next time! Will definitely go back.  Meat lovers delight."}
{"text":"What an AMAZING place to gather and enjoy scrumptious food!  The owners are super hospitable! One of the owners is a Pitmaster and a chef. His food is out of this world!  Best bbq in town and worth the trip to the east end for this bbq. Absolutely nothing comparable to this hot spot! Make sure you go check them out! It will definitely not disappoint. I've had everything on their menu and all items are excellent. Hurry up and go if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"Best bbq North of the border.  Great food, southern style friendly service, casual and authentic. I love an interactive service team/owner/host who comes and checks in on your experience while you're there.   Could think of only three things that would have enhanced our visit - a glass of Sweet Tea, a slice of cornbread and maybe a slice of pie for dessert, but truthfully I wouldn't have had room.   That said, Hubby had a great sandwich, I shared ribs and turkey with my son.  Also great.  All sides were excellent. I would have gone the sandwich route too but there wasn't a turkey sandwich offered on the menu and that's a shame because the turkey we did have on the platter was outstanding!  (I'm picturing whole wheat bun with the carved turkey and maybe some cranberry or sage mayo... but I digress.)  Definitely a 5 star for all of our party of carnivores, and that is dang hard to find in Toronto."}
{"text":"Loved it! The food was just. So. Good. Ordered the Mac & cheese and ribs, which practically slid off the bone. Staff was very welcoming and patient to explain the menu. What else do you need in a neighbourhood joint?   Will be coming back with more people in tow :) Welcome to the hood!"}
{"text":"Had the Austin sandwich and my son had the pork ribs. We shared a side of Mac and cheese and coleslaw.  Food was fantastic and the staff is extremely friendly! Great spot.  Prices are very fair."}
{"text":"The Ribs are the best! The meat were falling off the bones.  They dont do delivery i think so best to go early."}
{"text":"Finally made it here today. They are closed on Mondays and I have been disappointed several times. It was worth the persistence. We had the Big D (brisket, turkey iand sausage) and the Austin(brisket topped with a pork rib) sandwiches and sides of smoked beans and spicy Mac and cheese. You can help yourself to onions, jalapeños and pickles.  This is my favourite bbq joint in the city."}
{"text":"I enjoy a good barbecue and have to say this joint knows what to do with a piece of meat! The brisket is nice with good flavour and the pork ribs are to die for. They are a bit on the fatty side but so moist and flavourful. We also had the smoked turkey, which I found a little too smoky for my taste. The mac and cheese was just ok, but the potato salad was decent, and so was the slaw. A little on the pricey side for barbecue but worth it when compared to another smokehouse in the Beach which shall remain nameless. Good place for a cheat day!"}
{"text":"Clearly this smokehouse is filling a gap in the neighbourhood.  Line-ups are really long yet well worth the wait so hang in there!  I can see the popularity maintaining itself long past the initial newness has run its course.  Staff is first rate, balancing a never-ending hectic pace with taking the time to connect with customers.  My initial order was shy 1/2 pound of ribs, over which the owner connected personally when I sent a note, to ensure that this was made right.  I was very graciously offered a complimentary extra 1/2 pound of ribs and desserts, and could not be more pleased with the outcome.  The food was fantastic and the owner even more so.   The remainder of the review is all good news.  The brisket is ridiculously tender and delicious.  Baked beans are absolutely the star of the side dishes, with a mild bite and so much flavour!  We also had the mac'n'cheese which is quite good, and potato salad which could use a bit more moisture but had excellent flavour.  The chicken was good but scores third place of the meats that we sampled.  Ribs, had there been more of them, come second after the brisket.  We're thinking that the brisket sandwich with a bone on top and a side of baked beans seems to be the way to go."}
{"text":"Great BBQ, smoked over real wood! Very friendly owners too. Super tasty, it won't disappoint, unless it's sold out!!"}
{"text":"I stopped by the other day to look at the menu and I was impressed. So we ordered some barbecue to pick up and take home. It was so tender and juicy.  Finally some real Texas barbecue in the city and bonus points for being right around the corner from my house. The owner was very nice.  I like the fact that it's a family run place. Sorry Hogtown Smoke, but this is my new go to place.  31/1/18 I stopped by on the way home.  I skipped lunch downtown and it was 13:45 hours.  So I ordered 1/2 lb of Texas brisket. Now brisket scares me.  It's one of my favourite cuts of beef.  But so many pit masters give you some that's dry and drowning in sauce.  Or something that needs an oil change. This bit of brisket was perfect.  It was moist and with the right amount of fat on it.  Remember only a New Yorker will order lean brisket.  It's like ordering a vegetarian steak. The best part was that it was only covered in dry rub.  You could taste the spices accenting the flavour of the meat supporting the taste of the smoke. In my humble opinion Texas barbecue is the only true barbecue.  And friends, we are so lucky to have the real deal right here.  Now if you're lucky enough to read this before Saturday listen up.  They are closed on Sundays.  So they have put together a Super Bowl menu that you can pre order for pick up on Saturday."}
{"text":"Decided to check this place around lunch time because I'd heard rumours that some items sell out later in the day.  The food was amazing!  We had the brisket, ribs and turkey.  Probably the best smoked turkey I've had.  We also decided to splurge and get the Mac and cheese, happy I did, it was great!  Can't wait to come back and try some of the other stuff they have."}
{"text":"First time try at this new BBQ smokehouse in the Beach. And from the start you know you are going to be having a good meal. The smell of BBQ is the first thing that greets you as soon as you enter and that is such a wonderful thing. The menu is straight forward. So I gave the Brisket, sausages and ribs a try. The ribs are smoked so long that you can see how deep the flavor has gone in the meat and the Brisket is to die for. So tender and flavorful and the rub on the outside just gives it that delightful bit of peppercorns. Oh so good. The side of baked beans was very tasty. The cook and manager and staff are an absolute delight, you feel that southern hospitality.All in all I highly recommend you give this place a try."}
{"text":"The best Texas BBQ I ever had. The folks there are doing a great job. The food is good and is always given to you with a smile. Overall is a great experience. I wish they had a bigger place. There are always people lining up but they somehow manage to keep the waiting time to a minimum."}
{"text":"You don't want none of this! Because you'll have to carve out an hour every week to come get this.  You'll have to schedule your life around, \"when is the next time I can get some brisket?\"  See this ain't no casual meal, this is serious Q.    Ask yourself, \"Am I ready to eat hard?\" If the answer is no, don't come. Because the brisket will make you wanna slap somebody's mama. Then sausage will have you in the confessional wondering if dreaming of it is a sin.  The sauce will make you go home and discard all those facsimilies masquerading as barbecue sauce.   I've lived in Texas, I can vouch for this team.  Their brisket is 'bout it, 'bout it! I'll be back and I'll make time to sit, savor and shake my head as the goodness dribbles down my beard.  You have 168 hours in the next week, dedicate one of them to get this here grub and solve your problem."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favour and come here. The food is amazing - my husband (who is picky) said it's the best BBQ brisket he's ever had. The baked beans and mac and cheese were amazing. The service was so friendly and pleasant, we didn't have to wait for food and the price was good! My toddler ate the mac and cheese and bread. Worth braving the cold for!"}
{"text":"Unbelievable!! Best brisket sandwich I have ever had! I would drive from Brampton to eat here again"}
{"text":"It's nearly midnight and I'm eating brisket. I've been eating brisket all day. I went to Beach Hill Smokehouse for lunch and I ate brisket. I got in my car to drive home and I kept eating brisket. I snacked on brisket. I ate brisket for dinner. Now I'm eating midnight snack brisket. This stuff is the best EVER. Better than Adamson, no contest, and that is SAYING SOMETHING. And the dudes that run the place are amazing and wonderful and they are having fun with it all and serving up the best BBQ in town. I also ate smoked turkey and loaded baked beans - both ridiculously insanely amazing. I'm covered in grease and I've used a whole roll of paper towels and I'm happy as can be, get over there and get some BBQ for yourself - everyone should have this experience!!!!! Yummmmmmmmmmy."}
{"text":"I was here twice in January.  The food is delicious!  The brisket has so much flavour and falls apart as you eat it.  All the meats have a wonderful smokey taste to it.  Over the 2 visits, we had the ribs, brisket, mac and cheese, baked beans, coleslaw and sausage.  The sausage and the beans both had a little kick to it.  We also tried the pecan cobbler - wow!  It's like pecan pie without the crust."}
{"text":"Best bbq you'll ever have!  Straight outta Texas.  All smoked meats will melt in your mouth, side are to die for.  There's not a single smoke house in Toronto better than!"}
{"text":"This place is great. The best bbq this side of New Orleans. The aroma hits you as you walk in the door. The sides and dessert are also outstanding. Have a chat with Terrence, the chef/owner with talent and charisma. Take your friends and an appetite."}
{"text":"I was going to visit Beach Hill Smokehouse with my lady friend,... but, my tummy couldn't wait,...   Anywho, dropped in today for lunch. All the tables were taken up,... and there was a lineup,... it was amazing to see a local business thrive.  I ordered the Austin Sandwich to go. Among with the Small Peach Cobbler. Packed up some pickles and jalapeños on the side too.  I had super high expectations, and I wasn't disappointed. The sandwich with ribs on top was delish! The pickles were refreshing, and the kick from the jalapeño was just what the doctor ordered.  I didn't think I could finish the Peach Cobbler,... but it went in my tummy just right.  Can't wait to try the rest of the meats it's my wifey next!  Keep up the great cookin!!! City Folk Approved!"}
{"text":"Incredible - best barbecue and we've been to a few in Toronto and the US. You have to go here."}
{"text":"Dropped by on a Friday night, about an hour before closing. Line up at the back was 6 people deep when I arrived. By the time I ordered, another 6 were behind me. Food is simply lip-smackingly yummy.  We decided to eat in, and realized you line up and order at the back, and then take your tray to the wooden picnic tables at the front.  Food is outstanding. Huge portions of delicioua smoked meat.  We had the brisket on a bun, which was topped with an amazingly tender, large meaty rib.  And we ordered the half chicken.  Wow.. what tender and smokey meat. And the price? Unbelievably low for the quality and taste. Will I go back? In a heartbeat.  Can't wait to try the rest of their menu!!  Saw the tray of the southern mac and cheese and it looked \"wow\"."}
{"text":"We finally tried this place and what a fantastic surprise. Ordered a pound of brisket, the whole chicken plus beans and coleslaw for the two of us and had enough food for two meals. The brisket literally melted in your mouth, and the seasoning was just perfect, right amount of salt and flavour. I was reluctant to order the chicken as have found smoked chicken to be dry in other places, but this chicken was so expertly cooked and seasoned, We turned leftovers into the best chicken sandwiches the next day. It was even better the next day, seemed even juicier! Am happy this place isn't closer to my home as would be dangerous temptation."}
{"text":"Stopped in this week I think on Tuesday around 2:30, which was great because it wasn't super busy so we didn't have to wait. Got a half pound of ribs, half pound of brisket, mac & cheese and baked beans. Everything was absolutely delicious! Portion sizes are also great. One of the best things about this place is the service. Who I'm assuming are the owners, are the nicest guys out there! You have to check this place out if you're in the east end."}
{"text":"Holy smokes! Lord have mercy on my soul. Sweet baby Jesus. The moment you step in, you are greeted by a warm welcoming whiff of smoke. As I watch countless people devour their trays of meat, I could not help but to salivate. Line was relatively short(thank god).   Finally greeted by the most cheerful cash guy(mad props). Decided to break my order down to 2 phases. Phase 1 (eat in) - Austin and The Big D' and Phase 2(take out) - 1lb brisket, 1lb ribs, half pound turkey, 1 sausage, 10 wings, coleslaw, Mac n cheese, bread pudding and banana pudding and cornbread .   As I collected my order I rushed to the nearest table to get a quick sample of the 2 sandwiches. Oh my...the ribs are to die for. The first initial bite reminded me of pork jerky, but as soon as you get through the initial chew, it disintegrates into your mouth like butter. The buns were perfect for the meat to absorb all the juices. The brisket fell apart. Meatgasm was achieved.   As of right now, I have the phase 2 waiting for me. Unfortunately the portion size of the 2 sandwiches were too generous leading me to a part food coma.  Without even tasting the other meats I'm going to say this is THE best bbq in toronto.   Props."}
{"text":"Just walked in and met some real nice guys and then they gave me some really good food. Yep, happened that quickly too. You can probably call and talk to them, but there is no need. I had the Austin, which is a bunch of meat and sauce on a bun with meat on top. See where we're going here...they make good meat. Enjoy! I know I will again!"}
{"text":"Beach Hill serves up tasty Texas-style BBQ in a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The brisket was very good, and the turkey, while a bit dry, was still well-seasoned and flavorful. The special brisket barbecue beans were fantastic - sweet and savory, tender, and with a bit of spicy zing.  I got my food for takeout, but the restaurant interior is very nice if you want to eat in. There's a lot of table space, and you can take freely from assorted condiments, such as onions, pickles, and various BBQ sauces.  While I still prefer BBQ actually from the south, Beach Hill is a good choice for you away-from-home southerners or just southerners at heart."}
{"text":"Really excellent food and service. Highly recommended. Grabbed a selection of meat and sides for take out, and was really pleased with everything."}
{"text":"After coming here the first time, I told my friend who lives in the neighborhood to go try this place. We then proceeded to visit this place twice in the next week on separate occasions. So what do you get here? The smoked brisket or the dry rubbed ribs?  The spicy mac and cheese, refreshing coleslaw, or the chunky potato salad? The peach cobbler or the cornbread?  The answer: Order everything and worry about it later."}
{"text":"Went today on their Opening Day. Been waiting patiently for the open since hearing about them moving in to the neighbourhood. I had plenty of time to build up the expectations in my head. I have the say they surpassed any and all expectations and hopes I had.  First the people running this restaurant have a friendliness and passion that is infectious.  Upon entering I was greeted so warmly by the entire staff, it was amazing.  The interior of the restaurant looks very nice and comfortable for people dining in. Myself, I was getting the BBQ to go.  I ordered a bunch of stuff off the menu to get a good gauge of their work. We ordered the Brisket, Ribs, chicken and sausage as well as the Mac n Cheese, baked beans and coleslaw for sides.  All the meats where smoked to perfection!  The Brisket was practically a religious experience. All the sides were delicious with me favourites being the baked beans and the coleslaw which had I nice touch of heat to it.  This place deserves to be a huge success and if the opening day was any indication this restaurant is going to be an incredible hit and a welcome edition to the east end.  Welcome Beach Hill BBQ. You made a huge fan of me tonight."}
{"text":"I consider myself a BBQ maven. Until we downsized and moved to an apartment I smoked my own ribs, briskets and butts. These days I drive to and from Mexico, and make a point of stopping in Q joints in Tennessee, Texas, Kentucky, and wherever else I find myself.  This place opened in January, and is run by two retired football players. It is pure Texan, and we ate there tonight for the first time. It had received a full write up in the  Globe and Mail, so not surprisingly it was busy. But worth the wait. The brisket, the Texas' BBQ signature dish, was fabulous: tender, juicy and rich. The ribs were delicious with a small bite that kept them from being too soft. All in all, it excellent. The best Q in Toronto!!!  Oh, and turn up early. They run out of what they run out. At 5 pm we got the last of the coleslaw..."}
{"text":"I believe it's ILLEGAL to charge gratuity that was not approved by the owner of the credit card when it was not written anywhere that it was mandatory. Heck most places charge no tax or no gratuity on PICK UP ORDERS since you're not taking up space in their establishments and not being served. A simple communication back from the manager would make sense in customer service."}
{"text":"OH Wowww!!! I'm glad it's close to our place. Very good BBQ place. The meat was delicious and tasty, melt in your mouth. We had chicken, ribs, beef brisket, sausage and portobello mushroom. Everything was amaizing. We waited 15/20min to get served but worth it. The place is quite big for a BBQ joint, didn't wait at all to get a table. The owner care about his customers, he comes around and chat with you. We will definitely come back."}
