{"text":"excellent breads and buns and bagels and coffee 
nice and clean environment and well, good music"}
{"text":"Fantastic texture in their loaf bread. So hard to get that light, airy gluten free bread but they nailed it. And wonderful toasted, too!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop, lovely staff~ The Matcha latte was perfect, I specifically asked no sugar and it came out beautifully. (It means they used real matcha instead of those 'matcha mix'.) The girl recommended the chocolate chip cookie (left) but it wasn't for me (it was the last one left tho). 
The lemon poppy cake thing on the right I liked, it was moist and chewy, with a hint of refreshing lemon and not sweet at all.
Definitely will come back for the matcha and lemon cake ;P"}
{"text":"Seconding everyone's reviews on the GF chocolate and regular croissants...really, really good!! The baguettes are also super tasty, as were the madelines!"}
{"text":"Best gluten free anywhere on the Continent. Bagels, croissants and Madeleines. Fabulous! Created by two McGill alumni. Staff is very kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here to get some of the GF croissants for my mother with Celiacs. They're really tiny and the store didn't even have any of the chocolate ones available ... I know they're marketed to be more a delivery service, so maybe it's better done that way (I didn't have time to wait - there was quite a long delay and no delivery on the day I needed them for). Overall I was just rather unimpressed , the croissants were ok (my mother said she'd had better GF ones before). Nothing else in the storefront enticed me either.. 

Bottom line: not bad, just meh"}
{"text":"J'ai découvert cette boulangerie par hasard en marchant sur Saint-Laurent et j'y suis entrée quand j'ai vu l'affiche sans gluten.

Quelle fût ma surprise de voir tous les produits offerts sans gluten! Du pain blanc ou compagnard, des pains à hot dog, hamburgers, même des bagels! Ils ont aussi des pâtisseries : biscuits choco, madeleines, brownies, pain aux bananes, etc.

Et c'est génial parce qu'on peut goûter à tout! Le pain est très moelleux, comparativement aux autres pains sans gluten que j'ai goûté.

Prix aussi très raisonnable, même moins cher que les produits sans gluten surgelés qu'on achète à l'épicerie."}
{"text":"Depuis que j'ai reçu mon diagnostic de maladie cliaque, je ne jure que par cette petite boulangerie sans gluten. C'est là que j'ai trouvé les meilleurs produits. Ils n'ont pas l'air faits en carton et leur goût est excellent! Leur sélection est très vaste : chocolatines, croissants, biscuits, madeleines, croûtes à pizza, pains hamburger, etc. Il est même possible d'y commander une boisson chaude et... de faire des dégustations, ce qui est super! Comme ça, pas de mauvaise surprise à la maison. Je ne mets que 4 étoiles, car je ne sais pas trop quoi penser du service que je trouve un peu... bizarre? Malgré tout, les employés sont polis.

Vous pouvez également passer votre commande de produits de boulangerie sans gluten en ligne et vous les faire livrer à la maison. Tous les prix et tarifs sont affichés sur leur site très convivial."}
{"text":"The previous reviews were a warning, but in my enthusiasm  for enjoying gluten free baked goods, I tried it anyway. 

Prepackaged muffins are loaded with protein, which makes them practical for a quick nutritious breakfast or snack. But they're tough and dry. I honestly am not sure of what flavor I'm eating, which isn't a good thing. (Blueberry, raspberry, cranberry? Current? I honestly can't tell! I'm not sure and unfortunately, I don't speak French, so I didn't know what the clerk was saying.) The one true advantage is that they are non-perishable with an expiration date six months out. So, they can be stored and consumed for weeks to come. 

These will do, but Cookie Stefanie is FAR better for gluten free if you have a choice and a sweet tooth."}
{"text":"Charlie is a really nice guy, I am a chef in training at a school in Montreal and I had report due, I stopped off at his shop and talked about cooking and more specifically the innovation of cooking for health. He has a variety of baked goods for diabetics and also gluten-free options. It is lab as well as a great place to try new items, along the lines of a `El Bulli` cafe!"}
{"text":"Amazingggg GLUTEN FREE CHOCOLATE CROISSANT!!!!!! 

They taste just like the real thing! I took a trip to Montreal just because i found this place searching the web and let me tell you, i ate 24 croissant in 2 days! lol! they were so good i couldnt resist! (but they are small)...
Why doesnt NYC have gluten free croissant?!!!  Its what i miss the most being gluten free!  And now i have to take trips to montreal more often just for the croissant! I hope the owner reads this and opens a shop in nyc!!!!!!


Also know that you must reserve the chocolate and regular croissant bc they fly off the shelf! Call ahead and order them"}
{"text":"This place was an incredible find. The gluten-free croissants were heavily!  Finding a place that would make my family happy being gluten-free was a incredible find. My son has not had a croissant since he has been gluten-free for almost 5 years. She couldn't believe how good it was it reminded him of when he used to be able to eat gluten this place is fantastic if you're thinking about it stop thinking and just go."}
{"text":"After a long schlep to find the spot while visiting from out of town, found only a few items left at 4p.m.  Bread was yummy and croissants a special find, but chocolate chip cookies were dry and unremarkable."}
{"text":"This GF bakery is so good that when I visit, in addition to eating as many regular and chocolate croissants as possible while I'm in Montreal, I always get a huge batch to take home and freeze.  Incredibly addictive.  

The first time I got these (in 2015 - when my love for these delicacies started), the croissants were smallish (but a completely reasonable size) and chocolate were only available on Saturday.  NOW, though, the size is comparable to regular croissants and they have the chocolate croissants every day.  

In addition to the croissants, the other breads and baked goods are virtually indistinguishable from wheat products.  

Owners and staff are always super nice.  Love, love, love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is a Diamond in the rough. What a Gem!

We are traveling from the states and my partner found the store online. We stopped on our way back to Toronto and fell in love with this little sweet spot. 

The owner who was helping us was extremely friendly and courteous. We explained my partners dietary needs and he guided us to some of his best products. We had a great conversation over food, politics, nutrition, and more. It was a great experience. Lots of cookies, breads, and snacks to choose from. Great packaging and amazing shelf life! 

After reading some of the comments about the food items being \"just ok\". Well yeah! You can't get much richer than Butter, flour, salt, and water! Who doesn't love the crispy, flaky, amazingness of a croissant! BUT, what if you can't eat that, OR choose not to load your gut with flour? Then what.

This store and movement is about health and wellness. The more people understand the importance of what we put into our bodies and the effects of allergens like Soy and Flour the more this store will become a resource to the community. 

I wish we had one one in the states to help out our community. Thank you for being in the market and filling an ever-growing need of health and awareness. 

Enjoy!"}
