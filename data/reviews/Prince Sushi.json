{"text":"In had the opportunity to eat here last December 2014 with some out of town co workers.  I am not a sushi lover so, you ask, why would I go here??  Well I was assured that although sushi was the speciality there were lots of other options.  And I was right.  The menu was full of many different dishes and at $21 per person all you can eat I left full and satisfied.  Serve was quick, friendly and efficient.  Everything was freshly made and tasted awesome."}
{"text":"Decided to go to Prince sushi tonight (picked it over Heart Sushi and 168 Sushi) - biggest mistake ever! Prince Sushi gave my cousins and I the WORST all-you-can-eat experience ever! After placing our order, we waited an hour before getting food and that's not the worst part - they only brought us 20% of the items we ordered!! After speaking to the person in \"charge\" (the manager was MIA), and complaining that we had been waiting over an hour and still hadn't received even close to half of our order, the rest of our long awaited food magically started to come out but by then it was too late - we had lost our appetites. Told them to take the food back and to discount our bills since we didn't think it was fair to pay for an \"all-you-can-eat\" meal when we only ate edamame and avocado salad but as expected, they told us the only thing they could offer us was a 10% discount!!!! Didn't even cover the taxes!!!! Unbelievable!!!! Never going back there again!! Horrible service. Horrible quality. Horrible experience."}
{"text":"WORST! I repeat WORST experience ever! The customer service was ridiculous! Such a joke! We ordered off the all you can eat menu and didn't get the majority of the food we ordered!! We had to ask the server what was going on and she said the chef lost our order list!!! She then comes back with the list and apologizes... This was about 1.5 hours after we had placed the initial order. After such a wait we had no appetite...especially since the sushi itself was very low quality!! I've been to prince prior to this experience and didn't mind it. Be aware it has gone WAY DOWNHILL. Save your time and money and go to Heart sushi.. Much better food and customer service. By the way...after such a horrible experience...the manager which was not there and had to be called via phone only offered 10% off the bill."}
{"text":"This was an awesome little find for us! We had just spent a few hours doing some shopping and we were starving! So we yelped and this place came up, we decided to try it out as it was close to where we were. We were seated right away as it was fairly early around 530pm.  We chose to not go with the all you can eat menu for $25/person as us 3 girls would never really eat that much. We ordered a few things to share...miso soup..salad...calamari...gyoza...dynamite roll...spicy salmon..and dragon roll.  The food came out really fast and hot! Everything was really good besides the miso soup...that was extrely salty. We tried to return it but were told that it came from a batch and all would taste the same. My only complaint is that we were still charged for the soup that we didn't drink...but we were not going to argue as our food was soo yummy.  We ended up paying about $45 all in which is half of all you can eat. 

Overall I would recommend this place, it definitely hit the spot for us."}
{"text":"Review: 4.5/5

After reading the stellar reviews of fellow Yelpers and sushi enthusiasts, Bilal and Bernie, I decided to give this place a try. 

Boy were they right! It was amazing! The first impression was great; the decor and ambience were good and it was quite full, which is always a good sign. 

We went for the AYCE. The appetizer shrimp and vegetable tempura was good. The sushi was amazing! The fish was fresh and the rolls well formed. One minor problem: I felt the maki rolls had a tad bit too much rice. Also, the ubiquitous spicy salmon roll was a tad bit below expectations. Nonetheless, the maki rolls were quite good...Especially the dynamite and salmon avocado rolls. 

The sashimi was phenomenal! The fish was extremely fresh and went down very smoothly! 

Service wise, they were great. Contrary to other AYCE joints I've been to, the service was surprisingly quite fast! I think they are also slightly cheaper than other AYCE places. 

Overall, if you like sushi, especially AYCE sushi, this is a must try. It is definitely a winner in my books! Let me know what you think. Bon Appetit! :-)"}
{"text":"For a sushi place .. i wasn't really impressed... maybe i'm spoiled by all the other sushi places I eat att ..

here here is my run down, food is alright, menu is okay, and the prices are alright too, but having said that i found the sushi to be just regular ..

staff really sucks, and have nothing to add in terms of opinions or anything .."}
{"text":"Prince Sushi Mississauga is a good choice for a quick lunch or take-out.  Pretty decent quality at a very reasonable price.  AYCE option for dinner after work too.

Food - They are pretty busy so the sashimi/sushi cycles through fairly quickly.  Pretty good variety of sushi, sashimi and maki items and portion sizes are good.  Combo lunches are a great deal with miso, salad and rice included.  Spicy Salmon hand rolls are one of the better choices.  Sashimi cuts can be a bit on the thick side sometimes but that's more personal preference for me.

Service - Very friendly and responsive.  The servers really work for their money... they are on the go the whole time during the lunch hour times to ensure everyone gets served quickly and attentively.  10% discount for pickup and order ahead over the phone and it is usually ready in 10 minutes.  Friday lunch seems to be the busiest day and can sometimes have short line-ups for tables.

Environment - Smaller and intimate with pretty basic table set-ups... no sectioned off booths like at Prince Steakhouse in Etobicoke.

For mid-level sushi this is my go to in Mississauga."}
{"text":"One of our favorites. Service has improved with Stephanie running the show these days. Big fan of the beef teriyaki and the seaweed salad, but it's really tough to go wrong with any selection on the menu. Big lineups on the weekends tell you that this place knows what it's doing and the general public agrees."}
{"text":"After the whole day of playing badminton, a friend recommended this place as a go to spot for ayce. For the price of $25, it was worth it! The sashimi were fresh tasting, and there was lots of selections. We tried their yakitori shrimp (great size) and the shrimp was actually firm and not soggy like most places. Their bacon wrapped asparagus was yummy too. Their beef striploin or filet mignon like was cooked at medium. 

The spider roll was actually good quality and had meat in it compared to some that has just some legs. The preparation time to bring out the food was quite reasonable. Although they did forget some stuff here and there, but recovered quite fast. The place is quite busy as well, but they're attentive on the water refills and the order process. This place deserves another go next time i'm in the area of Mississauga and crave for ayce again."}
{"text":"Treated like a king , food quality did not disappoint . I just wish they had better rolls , too much rice . Other than that though the quality was definitely there , could tell they don't cheap out in ingredients . Udon beef was so good ."}
{"text":"The quality of the sushi and other items are really good compared to other all you can eat sushi restaurants however the service isn't the most consistent. In the 4 times I've been I have only been asked if I wanted a refill once, all the other times I had to waive someone down. Other than that I do continue to come here since the food is good."}
{"text":"First chose this place because it was walking distance from the hotel, but found myself going every couple of weeks when I was in town.  Great price, and \"all you can eat\", selections from the menu, order different small dishes.  Food was great, small dishes so you could try lots of different things without totally stuffing yourself!  Great to go on your own or with a group.  Staff is friendly and attentive.  Will miss this place when I no longer go back to Canada!"}
{"text":"I came on a Sunday evening with my boyfriend and ordered from the a la carte menu. We ordered a Maki Set and the Chirashi Dinner. We were disappointed by the quantity of sashimi in the Chirashi and how small the Maki rolls were. The quality of the fish were decent. 

The biggest issue we had was the slow service. It took over 30 mins from the time we asked for the bill to the time we actually paid. 

The experience may differ for AYCE, but the slow service will keep us from coming back to try."}
{"text":"Delicious! Probably one if the best all you can easy sushi restaurants in Mississauga. Server was great even to accommodate our big group of 9. Sashimi was fresh and rolls were nice and big. Our table kept ordering beef tataki, which is a thinly sliced rare beef, a must try. Service was good, and food was excellent and served quickly. Will come again."}
{"text":"First time at an all you can eat sushi buffet.  The servers might have changed because they weren't that bad.  Maybe I'm used to crap service? lol.  Anyhow the food was better than I thought an AYCE sushi buffet would be - I was expecting grocery store sushi quality but it was much better than that.

There is a time limit of 1.5 hours and they let you know when it's \"last call\" so you don't get left hungry.  Also, no spoilage fees like I've seen in some places in Montreal (which deterred me from going) not sure if that's common in Toronto."}
{"text":"Pretty good quality sushi for AYCE. Lots of variety and food is pushed out of the kitchen/bar pretty quickly. However, I don't think that any of the staff would win any customer service trophies anytime soon. They are on the most part unfriendly, abrupt and will ask you directly if you plan on tipping them if they don't immediately see any extra cash on the table. Service aside though, I'm a fan of their food."}
{"text":"Foodies beware!

Don't waste your time!

Bad customer service, poor quality of food and embarrassing lack of management. 

Should be called Sloppy Sushi because it's horrible. 

Read other reviews who all state the same. 

My friends and I ordered \"all you can eat\" and only got half the servings hours later... Waiter judged us because we ordered an extra salad, had to keep asking where our food was because other tables were getting priority over ours. 

Here's a tip for the owner: invest in management.

{"text":"this is my second favorite sushi place, right after 168
the food is fresh and amazing, the staff is nice and attentive my only problem with this place is that its way to small they should get a bigger location !!"}
{"text":"I used to love to go... Yes!  used to! Did they change the owner or change all the staffs? I went on April 14th , I was extremely disappointed .  The service was very bad ; he messed up our order and question us if we have ever made that order; 2) he was not patient , he ignored us and ask us not to wave him .he will come to take our order paper 
3)(the third one may not related to him) he not allowed us to order 6 ice cream for 5 ppls  , 
we were like WHAT ? It is all u can eat ? 
I swear, we ate all the food , nothing left  ! And reasonable order for 4 girls and one guy !"}
{"text":"If I had to review a sushi place last year, the company would go out of business ( actually since I'm not elite, no one would listen to me). What I mean to say is I hated sushi. Then I came to this place. Wow.  Probably the freshest tasting sushi and I've been to a few places now. 
The service is great and very friendly. Sometimes if you order too much, they forget some of the stuff, but its all-you-can-eat so just order it again. And again. And again. Stuff some in your knapsack, then order again. I'm kidding, don't do that.
Definitely worth a check out!"}
{"text":"It's true what they say about Prince, the fish quality is excellent but the service (on most occasions) is below par. If you live in the west-end of the GTA Prince Sushi is a definite competitor, especially compared to the joints in Brampton. Decor is great, music is always piano or instrumental which is a plus. A reservation is a must, yes even on a Monday night.

I've been going to Prince for years, brought numerous parties and it's been consistent: good food, bad service. 

The one thing that gets me most about this place is the serving quantities. With the order sheets given to you, YOU choose how much of each item you want. It's ironic when you order a large quantity of salmon sashimi for two but still get a small order. No matter how many times I've been there, they don't take into account of regular customers and their needs. Every time I order 20-30 pieces of salmon, I really do mean I want 20-30 pieces but I'll end up with 10-15. I've even circled around the number of orders that I want but I never end up with it. I know this is partly due to the fact that they want to save on sashimi and fill you up with other menu items, but come on. 

Prince is known for their poor customer service. I've had a server spill hot tea on my friend and didn't really apologize (just shocked and awed). I've asked if it was possible to make a yam tempura roll seeing since they have all the ingredients but I was quickly denied with no explanation and then walked away. The servers that have been there longer aren't the nicest, but the newer ones are. 

I don't go there as often, but it's always my fall back place to go. 
Food 5/5 Service 3/5 - 4/5 overall"}
{"text":"This is my favourite sushi place in Mississauga and I try to not let too much time pass between my visits. Can be a little tricky to find a table during the holidays due to it's small-ish size but no problems otherwise. Their rolls/sushi/sashimi are are consistently exceptional. Favourite items on the menu must be the beef onion rolls, shrimp skewers, and green tea ice cream. 

I usually go for the all you can eat with my friends, and occasionally we find that they serve us less amounts than we ask for. Not a problem as we can always order more."}
{"text":"This place is OK, but just that, OK...
Nothing great about it, the food is not great but it is not bad either.
The restaurant is kind of nice, if you plan on sitting there and eating, but if you are there for a take out like me looking for a decent lunch, there are better choices out there.
The price is reasonable, you do get a decent amount of food the money you spend."}
{"text":"Definite recommend. 

But I never would have known of the bad service people speak of in their reviews because the waitress handling our table was attentive and polite as well. 

Food was excellent that night (everything neatly prepared and tasted fresh), very nice modern dining environement, great location for before/after movie dining."}
{"text":"All you can eat, great food, great atmosphere and great service. I highly recommend this to any sushi goer in Mississauga. Excellent options with a wide variety of options, a decent drink menu and knowledgable staff. The restaurant can get quite busy and is on the smaller scale so I recommend booking ahead of time. Overall the price is fair for what you get. This restaurant makes for an excellent dinner out with the family or a great date night. Added benefit is there is plenty to do around the area such as the movies."}
{"text":"Food is just so so. But 40 mins to cooked fried rice!?! I know this is a sushi sashimi restaurant but come on. There's no reason for me to come back here. Heart sushi the service is quicker and the quality is better."}
{"text":"foods awesome, 
service is awful.

The staff seem rushed in doing everything and anything. Sitting you down , and seeing you out. (I think this is due to the high volume of office people that come in for 30min or 20min lunches. They need to eat and leave asap. So, it does the job)

If you want a quick lunch, its great. Even better with a friend you can blab on forever with and not notice the huffy puffy attitude of staff."}
{"text":"As I am a bit of a sushi snob, I give this place an average grading.  The restaurant is quite an intimate space.

Their menu is extensive with cold and hot items to order.  My date and I ordered a little bit of everything on the menu.  The food was presented well.

Service was quick, food was brought out to the table as they were ready.

The only downside is that we only did two rounds of ordering until they took away our menu.  We were a little bit confused as to why but we were also full. :)

For dessert, order the green tea.  My date got vanilla and it was really mushy.

Recommend this place if you are in the courtney park area."}
{"text":"Came here from a long day of shopping due to its Yelp ratings. Very small place for AYCE sushi, slow service and we even found hair in our rare beef teriyaki! Some of the food we ordered never came. The table beside us had the same issue. Price is $24.99 pp for the weekend which I think with the variety food they had should only be $16.99. The only that was good was that they had spider rolls which is one of my favorite that most AYCE don't have."}
{"text":"In my mind, still dominates as the best AYCE sushi in Mississauga.

Always packed, so I hear really bad things about their service and 'kicking you out' after the 2-hour time limit.

Still, the only AYCE place that you can just order the soft shell crab. SAY WHAT? Paradise. Also love that they have a great variety in rolls and sushi."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome menu and does not slow down you orders as some of the other places will bring stuff slower after your first order.

The place is located in the Courtney park plaza near cineplex and demetres. 

What can I say we ordered every kind of sashimi and dragons available and food was coming to our table as if it was a fast food joint :) I loved the fast service. The fish smelled and tasted fresh. The staff was great, friendly and fast!

Make sure you do reservation as the place aint that big and does get quite packed"}
{"text":"Our go to place for sushi. Fast fresh good flavours. AYCE and menu ordering, I like that. Great for takeout, they are always quick filling the order.  We love the salad dressing and the flavour on the spicy selections.  It can get busy so don't show up at the dinner hour and expect to sit immediately."}
{"text":"I find this place to be the snob of the AYCE Japanese places. Its only available in the evening, prices aren't that great because it is evening (20+), not a lot of room, staff is so so, and its hard to get a spot. It makes me feel like it becomes a privilege to get a table here. The food isn't bad but it's not the best considering all the hassle I have to go through. Also, the ice cream seems complementary. It's not like you can order all the ice cream you can eat.

On the good side, this place has the best beef teriyaki hands down out of all AYCEs I've tried. Sadly, it's not enough to make me a regular customer considering the vast array of options in the GTA."}
{"text":"Living in the suburban west-end (Mississauga), there are a ton on AYCE sushi places to choose. 
Usually we venture over to 168 Japan Buffet on Dundas to satisfy our cravings, especially since majority of what we eat at AYCE sushi consists of sashimi, so cheaper prices or lunch rates don't make much difference. 

The bf wanted to try a new place, and seeing as how Prince sushi was one of the few places that still serves Spider Rolls (Soft shell crab), he was immediately sold.

On Sundays, they only open for dinner service, starting at 5pm. When we got there a bit after 5, we were their first table for the evening. However, half way through our meal, the place was packed! They take reservations, so I definitely recommend calling ahead if you're planning to go in a large group.

The ambiance is very different, and you certainly don't feel like you're dining at your typical All-You-Can-Eat.

The service we received there was probably one of the better, if not best, in any AYCE sushi joints in Mississauga. The servers were quick and attentive, regardless of how busy it got.

We order an assortment of sashimi; Salmon, White Tuna, Butter Fish, Red Snapper. It was all fresh! Perfect cut, wasn't frozen (unlike Sashimi Island..), no fishy smell.

The avocado in our Salmon and Avocado maki roll was fresh, and wasn't browning, not too much rice, an OK amount of rice on the unagi sushi, and the Spider Rolls were huge.

The only downer - they don't have much of a selection for grilled foods and appetizers, compared to 168 sushi. Also, no red bean ice cream!

Overall, although their menu isn't as extensive as some other places, the quality of their food and service definitely wins you over. We would definitely go back, especially for their sashimi!

Service: 5/5
Quality: 4/5
Cleanliness: 4/5
Menu: 3.5/5"}
{"text":"This is a staple restaurant for me as the sushi is always extremely fresh and tasty.  Staff is also very friendly and courteous. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"I go here for the amazing Soft shell crab, Gyoza, Teriyaki  & Sashimi meats and the mustard sauce. I've been here about a hundred times over the part four years. It's my go to restaurant for AYCE Sushi!

Tip: Make a reservation before you go here.

You may experience poor service on some days, but try to get it sorted out with them if you can. It's a fast paced environment, just try to prepare as much as you can, review their menu online and try to have an idea of what you want before you go. It will help."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! 
Well, the waiter n waitress are alright, they r just kinda rushed n unhappy looking. its the manager with the rude attitude that had us say \"Never again Prince sushi!!!\"
the 2 star is all on the food!!

food is good but not worth the bad service that come along with it.

we kept going back( 3rd time) cuz the food is decent there, but we went there again recently n ordered the way we always do. we knew they'd charge for left over food so we always try not to over order.( plus i hate seeing food going to waste) never had a problem with this system until now.
 this time the portion was much bigger than we remembered so even though we tried our best to stuff our face and still had a bit of food left over. 4 portions of salmon sashimi( 3 slices per)=12 but we got 16 or something, n we ate it all... n mixed mushroom was triple the portion of wut i rememeber....beef tataki also more slices than wut i ordered....etc etc......
a little bit of extra here n a bit of extra here=left over which they can charge u for!
n then i had 2 slices of butter fish sashimi which i thought wasn't fresh so i didn't want to eat...the waitress question why those were left over n i told her...it's not fresh so i won't eat it, she repeated \"NOT FRESH!??????\" ....yes not fresh! why is it so hard to believe? 
she questioned every little bit down to the fake crab meat on why i have them left over....i feel like a child explaining why i have food left in my plate to my mom! after that the waitress said she will send her superior over to take care of the situation.
when i explained to the manager i had extra slices of sashimi served to me, she shouted to the sushi chef \" did u cut them extra slices?!\" ...i couldn't hear wut he said but she said she punched in the order according to wut i wrote down...n this time she'll let me go, but next time she'll charge me...blah.....
i have no problem paying extra if it was my fault, but serving me too much n try to charge me for it? no thanks!
n i guess cuz we wouldn't finish our food n was the only customers left in the restaurant, they didn't bother offering us any ice cream.

there will be no next time, i will not go back there again. pay to have some one lecture u on finishing ur food sucks! i guess if u'd like to relive that part of ur childhood then its ok...lol  that's wut it felt like!! already so full but stuck at the table because u can't finished ur food...:(
n i swear, i puked a little when i was trying to get out of the car after...
i reallllly did try to finish my food........i dun think any restaurant should make their customers feel like that!

only way I'd go back there is if they change management...it is the best tasting sushi all u can eat joint in Mississauga I'll give em that.
so now, if i ever want all u can eat sushi i'll have to go to MAKIMONO in Pickering...yet to rate it on yelp but its the best one in GTA! 4 star!

gotta say, protion control @ a all u can eat joint is such a buzz kill!"}
{"text":"I was out shopping all day at Heartland Town centre in Mississauga.. Yeah.. yeah.. nothing new haha. Both of my sister in laws were starving and so was I, so we decided to get some sushi. We thought about going to Prince Sushi since it wasn't far from us, thanks to the handy Yelp app. It was Sunday night and parking at Courtney Park was brutal. After zig zagging through the parking lot we managed to find a place to park and ran into this place. At this point our since stomachs started to growl and we started to get really grouchy. When we walked in we had the oppurtunity to pick our own place to sit and we decided to get a booth infront of the kitchen. We decided on the a la carte menu and skipped on the ayce. To start we decided to get the calamari, chicken/veggie gyoza and two miso soups. The food came out fairly quickly and the calamari was so fresh and hot, that I burned the top of my mouth.. Just great! The gyoza was perfectly fried and went awesome with spicy mayo. The miso soup on the other hand was too salty and when we asked for another miso soup, the server didn't understand what we were saying. Why hire people who don't understand simple english.. Ahh language barrier kills me lol.  Any way nothing got solved but we ended up getting our dragon roll and spicy salmon with butterfish and tuna shashimi. It was so moist and fresh we devoured that in seconds. When we got the bill, we still got charged for the two miso soups that we took a sip from. Very irritating. Even if I asked to take it off the bill, he probably wouldn't have understood. Good thing is the sushi was on point. I want to give this place another star but the service ruined it for me. I just hope their servers improve because this place has great sushi :)"}
{"text":"Love their teriyaki and gyoza, large variety of sushi. Friendly service but can be a little slow as they are always busy. Restaurant is a bit small and dark."}
{"text":"IMHO, one of the best AYCE sushi establishment in the GTA!

The fish has always been really fresh (never had frozen sushi, like I've had at Yangs and other places), a good (average) selection of rolls, sashimi and grilled food but best of all, they serve soft shell crab by the plate!  That's right people, by the plate, no limits, all you can eat deep fried softshell crab goodness :)

Prices have come down since Wasabi opened up next door, so it's now your average AYCE price of about $22 on weekend nights. 

They're usually pretty busy, so I recommend reservations."}
{"text":"Prince sushi is my go-to AYCE sushi restaurant in Mississauga.  The food here is very tasty and also nicely plated unlike many other AYCE sushi places.  Although very fresh, their sashimi options aren't as impressive as other places, but still have good choices.  

My favourite items are the spider roll, green dragon roll and the beef teriyaki.  The beef teriyaki is unlike any other AYCE, which usually serve you an overcooked piece of cheap meat.  But not at Prince Sushi!  I get mine medium rare and it's mouthwatering!

The restaurant is quite small and usually packed, so I would recommend making reservations.  Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"One of the best all you can eat sushi in g.t.a!  Always fresh and always properly made, unlike other all you can eat restaurants.  They even have soft shell crab on the menu!"}
{"text":"Completely agree the staff is huffy and seemingly unhappy with their lives and life choices.  lol, that's their problem.

Decor and ambiance was decent, tables a little too cramped - I was literally bumping elbows with the awkward first date at the next table.  Surprisingly busy for a Monday evening, but that's a good sign no?

Anyways, the food was much better than I had expected.  Usually for edible AYCE sushi one must venture to the east end, but I would say this tops the declining Aji Sai (Bayview) and Sushi on 7 for my AYCE sushi needs. 

Sashimi was fresh and cut in generous pieces, rolls that advertised spicy actually were.  The important part was quality of fish, and they had it.

Overall a meal that exceeded my expectations.  Never would've thought Sauga could provide decent AYCE."}
{"text":"The good: prompt, courteous and friendly service.
The bad: the rolls were bulked up with double layer of rice - designed to fill you up quickly / cheaply (oldest trick in the book for an AYCE place)
The ugly: the sashimi was watery, bland, borderline tasteless and did not smell fresh.
Will NOT be going back. In Mississauga stick to Heart Sushi and Sushi Sushi for AYCE."}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick lunch and was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the end product. Not only was my Maki set (A) prepared quick, but the food definitely tasted fresh. Prices are not dirt cheap but certainly good for the end product. The interior deco is only meh but it's clean and got an open feel to it. 

Staff was friendly, although I didn't really interact with them too much since I was busy on my headphones and the place was pretty empty when I was there. 

Overall a much more solid experience than I expected (the other 2 times I've tried sushi out of Toronto didn't turn out that great) and definitely recommend it as part of a pre or post movie meal!"}
{"text":"This is the best all-you-can-eat in Mississauga!  I return here every time when I want to eat all I want.  It's fresh and service is great.  The down side is this place is too small and always packed.  Reserved a table if you have a large party."}
{"text":"So I went here again a few weeks back and realized I wasn't fair.  All the rolls are delicious, sashimi is extremely fresh and the butterfly shrimp are really good.  All 4.5/5.

But what I really love? The beef tataki - 6/5!!! seriously!! I could eat this all friggin day!!

Yes, it's raw, but oh sooooo good.  

So I gotta upgrade despite the loud small environment.  Food makes up for it."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my boyfriend and a few of his friends and I have to say I was very happy with the food and the service. The staff was friendly and wasn't overbearing. I would say they had a good handle of our table and seem to come to clear dishes and provided more tea at a good pace. 

This was an all you can eat sushi place and the menu I would say was a good size. The sashmi was very good, very fresh. All the other items we ordered were good too. 

I would come back next time I was in the area."}
{"text":"Great all you can eat find! Pretty extensive  menu for dinner with lots of non sushi items. Gets really busy since it is a smaller restaurant so make sure to make reservations. Great service and big portion sizes for the salmon sashimi. The rice is definitely different from other sushi places I've been but still pretty good. Rolls do come apart pretty easily. Would come back to this place if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I'm sad that this restaurant is closed..."}
{"text":"So Prince sushi didn't used to be an AYCE and a couple years ago decided to jump on the bandwagon, this is obvious by their location which is at the AMC Theatres plaza and is small in size with about 15 smaller tables. There is almost always a wait and reservations are a must when I go. 

With all that said their sushi is really top grade, they have all the staples and a few more additional special rolls.

Upset about their shrimp tempura orders, has to come with 2 veggies per 2 shrimp tempura. I don't think that is fair at all, only sushi place to do this, as far as I know. That's like saying if you want 2 pieces of salmon sashimi, you have to eat 2 pieces of tomako (egg sushi) X_X

It is probably a deterrent for people not to mass order shrimp tempuras, but some people who don't eat raw fish (allergies/personal preferences ie some of my friends) like shrimp tempura and don't like fried vegetables?!?!? What are they suppose to do? 

Except for that fact this is a yummy, smaller, nice and clean restaurant. The staff is a little bit low though, a few times where I had to stand up to flag someone down."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent customer here and I have to say, the food/service is always a hit or miss. Some days, the sashimi is well prepared with great cuts (ex. Salmon belly), while other days the fish looks like the leftover end pieces or is tough and chewy (ex. Bad cuts of tuna). Tempura items are sometimes cold and chewy, and sometimes hot and crispy. Again, very inconsistent. Otherwise, the rest of the food items are generally pretty decent.

Service is generally sub-par. One time, we arrived around 5 on a weekday hoping to get in an early dinner, but was told there would be an hour wait (for the near-empty restaurant) because the tables were reserved - even though no one was there or waiting for tables! My advice - make reservations if you want to eat there (even if it's a weekday, or the start of dinner service). 

Some of the wait staff are polite and at tentative, while others are oblivious and rude    (ex. Having to flag them down every time for a tea refill or to take orders, not saying thank you after you've paid AND tipped).

Weekday Mon-Thurs prices are cheaper than weekends. Overall they have the potential to be pretty good for an AYCE place - if you're lucky enough to go on a good day."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time when I had more friends living in Mississauga but they all moved down to Toronto so we don't go much anymore. Good AYCE sushi Variety and great \"cooked food\" selection. All the meat skewers/teriyaki comes with a delicious sauce and we always get the soft shell crab, not many sushi places have that. Always call beforehand to make reservations because it tends to get busy close to dinner hours."}
{"text":"A hidden gem! 

My husband and I went to this hidden wonder of a sushi joint today for lunch. 

It's right in the middle of an outdoor \"big box\" mall, wedged between a strip of franchise restaurant/eateries and a Cineplex movie theatre. You'd pass it easily if you weren't looking for it. 

Apparently, it's right near an \"All-you-can-eat\" Japanese place where you truly get bang for your buck, but we heard that people will frequent this place just because the food is so much better.  And for $9.95, there is an \"All Day Lunch\" special that has 6 pieces of California rolls and six pieces of sushi. And it's GOOD. 

We also a Tuna Sushi pizza with a spicy maki roll (combo) and the teriyaki beef, which was a ribeye steak. The whole lunch cost about $30.00. So worth it. 

The atmosphere was relaxed (a Monday lunchtime), with no crazy line ups. The place is clean with cool Japanese-inspired art on the ceilings and walls. The food and service were really good. Probably some of the best sushi I've had in a long time. 

We're going back, that's for sure."}
{"text":"Working out west in Etobicoke I decided after Friday Rockclimbing I'd meet up with a friend for some sushi.  She recommended Prince Sushi near Courtney Park and Hurontario.  Upon arrival, note-to-self, always make a reservation.  Due to the busy plaza, movie halls and restaurants, this place had a line up.  Luckily for us it was for a party of TWO. within 20mins we were seated, and ready to order.  Both of us opted for their AYCE sushi $24.99 Weekend price which isn't all too bad.  In terms of choices, they had a great selection, and the service was efficient, and courteous.  We ordered various things on the menu; sashimi salmon/butter fish/ green dragon roll, spicy salmon, edamame, soup, wrapped beef and green onion roll, etc... The quality is quite impressive as was their presentation skills.  In terms of ambiance, it definitely screams Japanese! and sushi lol.. and most of all, the place is clean!  Would I come back here, sure! why not, I had a great experience and now I have a go-to-sushi place in Mississauga :)"}
{"text":"I was here for lunch the other day - what a find.  I'm loving that they have a spicy salmon sushi pizza and spicy salmon or spicy tuna roll combo - when all is said and done.  I left full.  The quality of the food was great.  This was a great place to have lunch (it was a weekday, so it wasn't too loud or crazy)."}
{"text":"I was here on business from Los Angeles where we have lots of nice quality Sushi.    I also travel to Hong Kong alot where also there is great Sushi.    So for starters I did not have my expectations set very high seeing as how I am in Mississuaga Canada just outside Toronto.

Positives =  Nice AYCE quality served on platters for each item you ordered.    The food quality was about a 6-7.    I was surprised it was this high.    I especially enjoyed the rolled beef with onion.    I felt the price was also a positive as compared to where I am from it was quite economical.  

Negatives - I agree with others comments regarding the servers.   All very sullen, meek, quite, passive, and almost zombie like.    They obviously are not happy working there which is a shame.    IF a quality waitress were to work here I am guessing due to the higher average ticket that they could make a nice amount of tips.    I think this is an OWNERSHIP issue and not wait staff.    The reason I say this is because they don't assign just ONE person to your table but rather serve you as a group.   Thus no single person seemed to have responsibility for the table.   Perhaps a better approach to management and opportunity for each wait staff to take personal ownership for their customers will result in competition and increased incentive to please customers, earn tips, and garner repeat business for the establishment.     If they insist on waiting on customers as a group then the MANAGER of the group needs to motivate, coach, and develop the team better.    It's always the fault of the manager when a whole group is that way."}
{"text":"I only go for the all you can eat sushi. AYCE sushi, tends to say \"it's going to be cheap, but you'll get your fill at least\" Prince is by far the best AYCE place. The rice is proper - it has never been warm for me (the worst part of AYCE). The fish is great tasting. And the cooked food is great. They're the only place I know that lets you have medium rare beef - which is excellent. Their beef tataki is excellent as well. 

Prince is just a step up for all AYCE. It's probably better than most non-AYCE sushi places. 

You know, some people will say that \"Chinese run AYCE sushi places that are poor quality\" but Prince shows that is only a stereotype with no substance. In fact, the ambience, decor of Prince is top notch and it has a nice place. The servers, they use to be kind of mean (yet extremely efficient) but they have cooled down for the past 3 years. 

Over all, for the best AYCE experience in the GTA, I think prince is up there."}
{"text":"Great service, great food!

Went here once and had a great experience.  

Place is a little small, so be prepared to wait for a seat.  But once seated, service is quick! Its an AYCE and price is about $30 tax in.  Would definitely go here again:)"}
{"text":"Prince Sushi is an average Japanese restaurant. The sushi/sashimi tasted fresh and the soft shell crab is one of the best side dishes. The décor is nice and contemporary. However, the service is poor and was not friendly. Many of our dishes ordered did not arrive. Overall, this restaurant has improved during my last visits but needs to have better service. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant many times. Hands down some of the best Sushi in Mississauga, and very nice ambiance.

However we had some of the strangest service I have EVER encountered in a restaurant in ANY of the many countries I have traveled to, let alone Canada.

My husband took me there last night for my birthday supper (I am 28, not 19), we had a baby sitter for our son, and it was meant to be a nice relaxed evening, not some crazy birthday celebration.

We first ordered water and a beer each. They asked us how we planned on getting home. (huh? I am against drunk driving, but I have NEVER been asked such a thing upon ordering ONE beer each with a meal). We advised them we arrived by cab and were returning home the same way. (Note: we had not been drinking prior to arriving, and were not loud, rowdy, or acting in any manner that should make anyone question this.)

They brought us ONE beer to our table, and said \"This is big enough for you to share, yes?\".  SERIOUSLY??

So after that sort of response from them, it made things slightly uncomfortable. We ordered our food, didn't even finish our (ONE) beer and asked for the bill.

Once we paid and were going to leave, they offered to call a cab, and I thanked them but said we would be going to the movies first (it is adjacent to AMC theaters). Then they started to QUESTION us, and asked \"are you SURE you're going to call a cab?\"

How insulting!!! I have NEVER been treated like that in a restaurant. I could understand if we had been drinking, and acting loud, or rowdy, but we were not, in ANY way, shape or form. This was a very uncomfortable and awkward situation - despite the great sushi."}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Stopped by when we were in Toronto.  The service was not the best, but the sushi was top notch.  Probably some of the best rolls I've ever had.  Everything tasted fresh, sushi did not have excessive amount of rice unlike most other AYCES places.  Would definitely come back here next time we are in Toronto area."}
{"text":"Food: Great variety and very tasty. Love all their little side dishes (soft shell crab, beef tataki, butter mushroom...YUM!!!)
Service: Not the worst but, definitely could improve a bit. Few time we've walked in and had to wait few quite a bit before they even say hi to you when the restaurant wasn't even busy. One time we asked to sit on the booth and they said no and would rather save it for a bigger party which was fine and understandable, until another couple walk in after us and got it right away... 
Prince Sushi is one of my favourite sushi place in the GTA, food is always good!"}
{"text":"My husband works close by and brought me home a California roll, a salmon roll and a spicy salmon handroll (his pic doesn't do it justice).  I wasn't at all surprised that it was so tasty and such high-quality as it's part of the delicious Spoon & Fork chain.  The fish was so fresh, the rice was prepared just right and the handroll was overstuffed with salmon.  He said a lot of his colleagues go there for lunch and just love it.  Apparently the service was friendly and the prices were decent.  We definitely plan to go there for a sit-down dinner and continue to order from their take-out menu - try it as you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"One of my fav go to AYCE sushi places anywhere in town. Great service, modern decor, fantastic sushi, what's not to love?! But seriously make a reservation! This places gets packed in minutes! Worth the wait? Hell yes! Fantastic cuts of sashimi and nigiri. Sushi rolls its self quite nice (albeit same everywhere just better tasting!) great handrolls served well. As some other reviewers have mentioned the grilled stuff options are less, but well.. But I'm here for the sushi and sashimi, the grilled beef and chicken was quite nice though :) oh an have the miso soup! 

The desert options I'll mention, ice creams are the same flav as everywhere else (Mango and Green Tea), there was a cheesecake? I think but was just cream.

All in all great place to go to!"}
{"text":"Man, my go-to ayce sushi restaurant. Their service is impeccable (friendly, patient and outgoing staff), and delicious sushi and grilled shrimp (you must get this! it's on the hot food menu!) It's great for small dinner parties! Highly recommend you order as much Green Dragon rolls and Grilled Shrimp!

-Andrew Tran"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!

This was a great sushi place to try in Mississauga. My friend and I came here for dinner on a Monday evening.  I believe it is under the same ownership as Spoon & Fork, which I also love.  Prince has a simple AYCE menu and includes strictly Japanese dishes. 

Highlights: Udon noodle soup (noodles were tasty and chewy), fresh fish, great spicy maki and handrolls, and delicious green tea and mango ice cream!

Disappointments: Edamame, peanut satay sauce and udon soup were a little on the saltier side than what I'm used to at Japanese restaurants.

Service was great. They were very attentive, asked how we were doing, and constantly refilled our tea.

Atmosphere was somewhat modern, quiet and intimate.  It's not a large space, so I can see it getting really busy on weekends.

Prices were typical of any AYCE place: Mon-Thurs dinner: $20.99, and I believe weekend price was a couple bucks more.

I would definitely return to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"One of the better sushi restaurants in Mississauga. Definitely come for the all you can eat dinners. I think they are $30 at most. No refills on drinks though!"}
{"text":"The decor was modern and clean as well as nicely spaced affording guess to enjoy their visit.  No cramp tables on top of tables.

They do offer your typical sushi menu items as well as all you can each sushi and cooked items.  In fact their all you can eat selections is pretty much what you can order from their regular menu.  This is way better than most all you can eat as the selections are limited.

Service was good, very nice staff that works together to serve your drinks and meal.  There were 8 of us in the party so there was enough room for us and other patrons without an issue as they got packed really fast.  Even though they were packed and had every table occupied they still were able to give is the attentive service.

The sushi was good, not extraordinary but good for a visitor with colleagues after work.  We all had all you can eat sushi as well as other cooked items.  The hand rolls were served quickly keeping the seaweed nice and crispy as it just wouldn't taste the same once it gets soggy.

This is a good place to visit especially if you are hungry for some sushi and there is plenty of parking.  Just come early to avoid the crowd as it does get busy.  Great for date night since movie theater is right across from the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been to Prince Sushi over 3 times and I love it every time. The food is fresh. They serve all-you-can-eat dinners for $25 per person. Everything tastes so good. The restaurant is small so servers move around quickly. The food gets to your table fast. Did I mentioned the food is fresh? It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious. Amazing sushi. The place is small and packed. The line was out the door, it was a Saturday at 6:30 pm, so I should have expected it. We waited 50 minutes to be seated but we had nothing else to do, so I didn't really mind and there were so many people there, I figured it would be worth the wait.
The servers were really friendly and I loved every single kind of sushi we ordered. It was like every new one that came out was my new favourite. 

I like it much better than Wasabi, even though the place is very small. We looked over the menu while waiting and ordered as soon as we sat down. We ordered way too much and had to ask the server to cancel the rest of our order.

I had a very enjoyable dinner and left stuffed silly. I will definitely visit Prince Sushi when I am back in the area. I liked it very much.

$20 for AYCE dinner Saturday."}
{"text":"Very good ayce sushi.  This place has always seemed more about quality then quantity. Small and cozy with very limited seating which equals better service and food. I don't need a iPad to order thank you very much, I'll take human interaction. The sushi is on par with most non ayce places which is a good thing."}
{"text":"I love the beef tataki and beef teriyaki in this place, also their sushi is very fresh and tasty and I felt the service was fast and spot on. only complaint I have is they have very little fish (sashimi) to chose from, and they stuff their rolls with tons of rice which is understandable for being ayce.
Make a reservation for group larger than 4, otherwise you will wait."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised with the Prince. 

Although Prince Sushi doesn't look like much from the outside, the (tiny) interior is very nice if a little cramped. I especially enjoyed the knockoff Nagel prints. 

Our group did not do AYCE for lunch (not sure if it's available during the week?). I had a few basic rolls and found them to be fresh, well made and tasty. There are lots of combos available that include soup and salad and prices seemed reasonable.

Service was lightning fast and attentive - Prince knows how to move people through which is a good thing at lunch. They'll also take a reservation for lunch, another nice touch."}
{"text":"Food is good here.  Love the soft shell crab app here.  

The reason for the 3 star rather than 4 is because the service here is horrible.  

For an AYCE they time you to the second.  Often prior to your time up... they bring you the bill and rush you out even if you still have over 30mins to go.

I will not be coming back for this reason alone.  There are so many other places to feel comfortable and you feel good to give your money to."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant over 3 dozen times in the past 3 years.  The last experience concerns me as this is my favourite AYCE sushi house.  We filled out the order form asking for 4 orders of salmon sashimi (3 pieces per order), 3 tuna sashimi (3 pieces per order) , 4 orders of tataki beef and several other items.  We received 2 orders of salmon sashimi, no tuna sashimi, 2 orders of beef tataki and the rest of what we order.  
The slices were much thinner than what we have always had at this restaurant, I can say about half the thickness.  The quality was still very good.
Same thing happened on our second order as well, skimping on quantity and quality.
When I brought this issue to our waitress, it was a \"what do you want me to do about it\" look
Place is always busy.
I hope this was just a one off, will give them one more try"}
{"text":"Sushi was good but I'm disappointed they don't have the rose sushi. The sushi was average but they did not have a large selection. Sushi was average but not outstanding and memorable. Service was okay, and food was coming out at a good pace. Would not recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"Sushi was fresh; it came with a bowl of miso soup and salad. I'd say their sushi was better or similar to typical sushi you can get at a shopping mall sushi chain. I found it unusual that they charge you for your bag if you order a take-out because most restaurants don't charge you for the plastic bag used for the take-out."}
{"text":"I'm a fan, ayce comes to 28 dollars. good food mediocre service. Me and my gf come here pretty often for sushi fix. I like the chicken fried rice, green dragon roll, spicy tuna roll, shrimp tempura and avacado salad! They recently changed up the menu."}
{"text":"I love Japanese food and I know the words AYCE does not represent the best of Japanese food.  So when the monthly business meal comes around and Japanese food was chosen, I was thrilled... that thrill kinda died down when I found out it was at this AYCE place. 

It's conveniently located next to the giant AMC in north Mississauga with a ridiculously amount of parking available.  The restaurant itself is in the 'restaurant row' where you'll find a whole choice of food selections.  The restaurant itself is clean, trendy looking, and clearly had some effort put in for creating a good environment.  Black modern looking banquettes coupled with the occasional tones make it quite modern.  The service I cannot fault... it's always courteous and attentive.  

So why did I give this an average rating... the food.  Our group of 5 went with the AYCE and the pacing was slow.  It was as if the chefs couldn't keep with up with the orders from the various tables and the restaurant was only at 50% capacity.  In general, cooked items arrived hot so it wasn't the front of the house staff being lazy... it dragged our normal 1 and a bit hour lunch to nearly 2 hours.  

We ordered the tempura, dragon, dynamite, green and red dragon rolls.  In general, they were not bad.  The rolls were loosely packed and this caused most of the rolls to come apart when picked up with the chopsticks.  Often you had to rescue your roll because it fell apart in the soya sauce.  

The sushi was not great.  The shari (rice portion) was HUGE compared to the thinly sliced fish that sat on top of it.  The tuna was a bit too chewy... it was a weird texture.  Ebi (shrimp) was mushy actually... it was a bit alarming.  Usually it's chewy as heck but this was something else.  Salmon was ok... nothing memorable except for the mound of rice beneath it.  Also knife skill was clearly lacking as it looked like some pieces were cut with kindergarten scissors

Cooked foods fared much better but still slow coming out.  Katsu pork, chicken teriyaki, and salmon teriyaki were all better than food court fare and plated much nicer with good portions.  I think their chefs in charge of the hot foods are much more skilled.

So would I recommend or come back here?  I can't say I would do it willingly considering there is a new AYCE that is getting raves in the northern part of town (Heart Sushi).  I think I'll go there next to compare."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this place. One of best sushi places I've experienced, food-wise. The lukewarm customer service experience is the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars. I do value good customer service."}
{"text":"Limited selection, poor sashimi and sushi quality."}
{"text":"Here is a review of my trip to this restaurant. My girlfriend co worker came and said it was good, let see.

The first official dish that came was the rare beef. Warning about rare food, it must be kept below 4C. The beef came on the table almost at room temp. I am not eating that and I told the waiter why but I did not get an apology. Not a good start......

So the unagi roll came, not bad. The sashimi came, the rare material is fresh but the cutting is bad, the white tuna is not cut equally. Getting the grill steaks is actually good. This dish along with spider roll with a nice size soft shell crab saved this review from a bashing review.

Overall, this is a nice Japanese restaurant but I would be careful of what you eat here."}
{"text":"I love sushi!! And this was definitely not the right place to go. I went here once and ordered fried calamari as an appetizer and sushi.... the calamari had strings in it, was extremely slimy and chewy. Sushi wasn't that great either, I have had fast food sushi from the mall which tasted better. Basically we just paid and walked out without eating our meals.

Awful first experience and didn't end up going back till this day.."}
{"text":"The waiters are so not nice, polite and understanding! We meant to order a bunch of sashimi, but had accidentally checked them off in the sushi column. The ordered arrived at our table, we apologized for the misunderstanding, they took the plate back and gave us the intended sashimi! Most other AYCE places would've given us a dirty look and would make us eat the order. As always, the deep dried items were crispy, hot and well-seasoned (personal favourite is the deep fried coconut shrimp). The sashimi, sushi, rolls were delicious and accompanied with only a tiny bit of rice. My advice: call ahead and make a reservation, even on a weeknight."}
{"text":"When I want good quality sushi and don't want an AYCE sushi then I usually go to Prince Sushi. For AYCE I like Heart Sushi, because of the tablet system.
I like the cozy ambience and the way it's neatly and well furnished, making it look slightly upscale but yet casual. I've been here several times and seems to be one of the few restaurants that get filled up in that area of Courtney park, while several other surrounding restaurants get literally no customers all day.

Service is always good whereby the water is constantly being refilled. I really enjoy the sushi as they don't fall apart and are a good size. Although recently due to my experience at Hiro Sushi, my standards for sushi has gone a tad higher. But nevertheless, the quality of food is good and this is my to-go-sushi place. 
I've also got the Udon noodle bowl once, which was a good large size with a subtle and pleasant flavor.

So, if you're looking for good quality sushi without breaking the bank then this place is definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"Been here a few times as AYCE places go this is one of the better I've tried but their menu has changed so you don not to have options of all the classics anymore.  green Dragon roll and Spider rolls were trustworthy and their hand roll spicy tuna was pretty good.  Like that they offer dessert even though not listed on the menu."}
{"text":"Mmh! Delicious AYCE sushi in Mississauga. I know - what a paradox! This is where I would go if I wanted AYCE and didn't want to trek all the way to Scarborough to my favourite AYCE (Ten-Ichi!). 

Pros:
- delicious hot foods; and I mean delicious! For AYCE quality, it's really yummy! 
- presentation is great regardless of the fact that it's AYCE
- overall, food quality is quite good and well-made
- good decor: the environment, though small, is clean and nice

Cons:
- ditto all past reviews: service is BAD!! They rush you, they're rude, they're unfriendly... even for Chinese (yes, it's a Chinese-owned sushi place, surprise, surprise) service, this is bad
- ALWAYS PACKED - they don't take reservations for anything under 4 people (I believe) and it's hard to get seats unless you come early (even on weeknights)

Overall, if you can manage with poor service, the food and environment are a plus in my books, and I don't go out to eat in order to get great service; I go out to eat to eat great food and Prince Sushi fits in there quite snugly."}
{"text":"One of the better all you can eat sushi places in Mississauga.  Really busy so it's best to make a reservation.  We found that out the hard way."}
{"text":"Prince is King! 

They might as well change their name from Prince Sushi to King Sushi because this place is amazing. It's definitely my favourite ayce sushi place in the GTA. I have been here several times, and each time was just as satisfying as the last. Prince is located in the Courtney park plaza next to AMC Theaters and Wasabi. It's a small little restaurant and always busy, so I recommend making reservations if you plan on eating here. I don't know what it is about this place, but the sushi is amazing. I would compare the quality with not all you can eat places.

The first time I went here with my gf, we ordered while standing in line LOL. Yes, that's how hungry we were but it worked. As soon as we sat down, the waitress took our order and we were served almost instantly! 

So tip: if you have to wait in line, grab a menu and start ordering. Just don't make the same mistake we did and order everything on the menu. We had to flag someone down to cancel the rest of our order which is probably the most shameful thing an aycer can do. 

Regardless, this place is great. I just wish it were a little bigger inside so they could sit more people at once. Oh well, I'd definitely come here again (and again)."}
{"text":"The sushi was delicious!
The only thing I'd comment on is that the food came out very slowly. We ordered a lot (as there were a lot of us) but they also stuck us in a dark corner of the restaurant, maybe they forgot about us because we were hidden?"}
{"text":"We decided to try out Prince Sushi since he's never tried it before and I haven't gone  back in over two years. It was quite empty Sunday evening so reservations were not required. But if you're going in a larger group I suggest calling in because the restaurant isn't that big.

What stood out to us the most was the sashimi quality. The salmon sashimi were sliced to the perfect size and tasted so fresh and delicious! Also, the surf clam sashimi were larger compared to other places and tasted yummy. The maki rolls were quite large so we got full pretty quickly. We didn't even get to order a second round of food haha. We both liked how they didn't skimp out on the stuffing within the maki rolls. My boyfriend enjoyed his spicy salmon hand roll because it wasn't stuff with a lot of rice. Also, it was filled all the way to the bottom of the hand roll.

Service was great throughout our visit. Servers came back frequently to fill up our tea and asked how we were doing etc."}
{"text":"Always fresh. The best AYCE in mississauga comparing to the other places. Food quality is definitely the best."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend yesterday and I loved it. I have always had a good meal here. As soon as I got in, the waiter greeted and seated me. While I was waiting for my friend, the waiter asked to get me a drink right away.

Their lunch special was a combo for $9.95 of assorted fish sushi and California maki. It was tasty and also came with miso soup and salad!

Towards the end of my visit the service declined slightly because the lunch rush was starting to pick up. They did constantly refill my tea though.

Can't wait to come back here again!"}
