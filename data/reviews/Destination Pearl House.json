{"text":"I will give this place a 5+ star if it wasnt for the service. I honestly love their bbts here. So many choices and much cheaper compared to bbmania. Their wings are 35cents each (dine-in) everyday. Though the place looks hidden and the people serving us does not look like they wanted to work. Lol"}
{"text":"The bubble teas here are served in large glass sundae cups. Very delicious but extremely sweet, so I would not eat here too often (unless you have a crazy sweet tooth). Has a cozy diner feel to it. The toast with Nutella is pretty good, but the portion is huge so I recommend sharing with friends."}
{"text":"I was only meh with this place.  There bubble tea is good but I didn't like their food much . But their food quality has gone up since the summer.  I had their takyoki (squid balls),  udon,  fries,  mozza stick..  And they are all good!  Service is not that bad however I have only been there when it is not busy."}
