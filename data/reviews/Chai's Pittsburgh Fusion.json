{"text":"I got to try out Chai's Pittsburgh Fusion counter while at a food tasting event for Yelp at the airport.  I sampled two types of sushi rolls- California roll and a (tuna?) roll. I also got to sample a side of seaweed salad.  First- the sushi.  It was standard sushi - the rice was perfectly cooked, and both rolls tasted very fresh.  I could pick out all of the ingredients and they were rolled pretty well & held their shape.  The seaweed salad was wonderful.  I have tried this dish at many different places - cheap Chinese takeout, higher end restaurants, and buffets.  Some are good and some are just awful.  The one at Chai's was exceptional - it's a very standard seaweed salad but I can't deny that it was very fresh and flavorful, perfect consistency, and visually appealing.  It was my favorite part of the meal.    One downside is they didn't give me chopsticks and I didn't even realize until I found a seat down the hall in the food court area.  It was pretty hard to eat seaweed salad without chopsticks but I managed. The other downside is I didn't see any fancier types of sushi. Even if they just make one special roll of the day/week that is a bit elevated with sauces, roe, or different combinations of flavors, I think it would make this counter more interesting and draw people in, especially because it's kind of at the end of the row of food options and at a slight disadvantage.    All-in-all, I enjoyed my experience. If I wasn't already getting full from all of the tasting, I would have tried their hot foods because they all looked so delicious. Also I must add that the establishment was spotlessly clean - from counter to floor!  Chai's can offer you simple, fresh, and tasty Chinese hot dishes & sushi items while waiting for your flight. Check them out!"}
{"text":"Standard American Chinese food, with both ready-to-serve and made-to-order options. I got some egg drop soup and a 2-entree combo (you can pick 2 entrees and one side...sides include lo mein, fried rice, and \"spicy\" (not spicy) rice noodles). I got the rice noodles with chicken with broccoli and \"spicy\" (again, not spicy) tofu. Everything was flavorful and served hot. The man serving was friendly and appropriate, efficient at his job. My boo got the 2-entree combo with rice noodles, general tso's chicken, and chicken with mushrooms. He liked all of his, too! He was bummed bourbon chicken was out; we were in too much of a hurry to make a flight to wait for it to be made. They also have sushi, but we didn't try any of that.   Total price: $18 for a meal for 2, including one egg drop soup and 2 2-entree combos. Overall a good, solid airport option! Located in the center part of the terminals near where you branch off toward the A gates."}
{"text":"I stopped here for the yelp passport tour and it was my first stop on the trip. They served us sushi and a seaweed salad with a cookie and wasabi. It was cool to see the guy making everything there in front of you. The taste of the rolls didn't seem high quality or have much flavor but I feel it's what you would expect from fast food rolls at a airport. The seaweed now was delicious it was very flavorful and not overly salty as some others are. The staff where friendly but did not mention much about the dishes or who they are as a company. I would return again just for the seaweed but that's about it for me."}
{"text":"Chai's Pittsburgh Fusion is the new kid on the block for me. I normally don't head over this way but since I was here for an event we decided to check them out.  Today they were serving sushi, with green seaweed, and hot dipping sauce. We also got one of those packaged fortune cookies.   It was good but like pretty much anything else seemed like it was store bought and made as a Chinese fast food place. For vegans however, they do offer a choice of vegetable roll, tofu with vegetables, and the seaweed salad I already mentioned.  Located at the far end of the left food court area near concourse A, there is plenty of seating behind the row of grab and go eateries."}
