{"text":"Wonderful, fun and great food! Love the concept. Four Seasons was spot on to have a casual option! I live just next door and will definitely take my friends there. Happy to have a neighborhood bar with upscale service!"}
{"text":"Visited Proof for a weekend breakfast for something new. The experience was a huge disappointment. I have to say the staff was attentive and very polite, but that's where anything good ended. The brunch buffet was recommended and wasn't on the menu, so we tried it. The buffet turned out to be what I might expect at Denny's, but not quite that good. A crowed omelette station and the normal, bacon, sausage, potatoes, with a couple other items. I had an omelette with bacon and sausage. All were mediocre at best. The biggest disappointment was when I got the check. $71. For two buffets that could be gotten anywhere for under twenty dollars. After I picked myself off the floor and paid the bill, I vowed to scratch Proof off the list from any future visits."}
{"text":"I was in Scottsdale last week and Proof was by far the best meal we had all week. The 'smoked babe on a bun' pulled pork sandwich had great flavor and was so delicious. For the summer they even have a wine down Wednesday special that allowed us to enjoy a nice bottle of wine for only $40! The real star of their menu though is the dessert. We enjoyed both the french toast cheesecake and salted caramel chocolate cake, and you will not find anything like it anywhere else!  In addition, our server Giovanni was the most genuine, engaging server I think I've ever come across. He was able to describe any item we inquired about in great detail, and you could tell he has a great passion for his job. Aside from that, he just has a great personality all around! If you dine at Proof, definitely request Giovanni as your server. We look forward to going back next time we're in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Proof was a yummy fun dinner. The service was four seasons quality with a fun flair! The menu is unique and the drinks are great. I had the special which was spaghetti squash with pork medalians.  We also had breakfast here twice, which was good as well."}
{"text":"Actually 2.5 stars.  We were there on a slow Saturday.  Ordered at 1:06pm(no drinks) and finally were served at 1:56.   They sat us outside(which I requested), but on the lower level where we were the only customer, even though there were plenty of tables available on the main level.  It was hot, as we didn't have fans, and the cushions and pillows were making us sweat.  Food was very good but portions were small.  They get a 2.5 because the water server was attentive. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ice Cream Sundaes under the stars.. the Proof outdoor dining area is so romantic.... the smell of burning mesquite wood... soft music....comfortable seating and delicious sweet treats.. my husband of 44 years and I felt like we were on a first date... a truly sweet place to go...."}
{"text":"Great relaxing place to enjoy lunch or dinner.  Comfortable indoor and outdoor seating.  Great views from the patio make it a wonderful place to hang out for a meal or dessert.  Speaking of desserts, make sure you save room, as it will be one of the highlights of your experience.  All are hand made and so far we have loved everyone.  Food is creative and yet feels like comfort food.  We have tried multiple selections and have enjoyed them all.  I'm not sure you can go wrong.  The staff has always been friendly and the service has been great.  Because of the location for us we often like to just take our time and enjoy the evening and we have never felt rushed and yet the service has been right there to meet our needs as required.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and food is top notch. We were able to eat outside and had live music playing. No complaints at all.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I think Proof is too overrated and overpriced.  The location/views are lovely and for sitting on the patio with a drink, I would highly recommend it.  However, I entertained a family from L.A. here on their recent visit to Scottsdale, and there was really nothing that stood out as exceptional.  I was horrified when my guest received his salmon dinner- we had asked for it NOT to be blackened and we were surprised when it arrived that it was not only blackened, but AT MOST a 5 oz. portion of meat ($26.00!)!  I think my guest was still hungry when we left."}
{"text":"This is a truely fun place to eat. Really comfortable with great views. We went on Thursday night and they had a Hawiian theme with specials and fancy Hawiian cocktails.  The food and service were fabulous. The menu offers various selections that are custom designed by the chef, so you get the great food found in top restaurants in a comfortable and welcome setting"}
{"text":"30 minutes from Scottsdale on unlit roads was a little unnerving, felt like we were going to bury a body.  But worth the trip, nice IPA selections, Bells and Lagunitas.  Broke my virginity on Chicken and Waffles and it was delicious, the mix of sweet and salty really hit the spot.  Save room for a cereal milkshake with vanilla vodka, you will not be disappointed!  Staff was attentive and helpful.  Make it here"}
{"text":"We were visiting from Chicago and got the chance to get a babysitter and eat dinner at Proof. My wife and I both thought it was a fantastic experience. We received some good advice to eat outside and try to get a reservation near the time the sun would be setting over pinnacle peak. The service was excellent (one exception that it took a while for my wife to get her drink) with the waitress walking us through a bunch of the offerings since we wanted to possibly try a few different things. We ended up getting the pretzel knots and buffalo chili to start. They were both excellent. We couldn't beleive how soft the pretzel knots were. For dinner my wife had the rib eye special and I had the salmon. They were both done really well. Desserts were amazing - we had the triple layer chocolate cake and the turtle cheesecake. The cheescake had candied nuts that really took it over the top. I'd recommend to anyone who's looking to a nice night out or this restaurant also caters really well to a family night out. We saw at least 4 or 5 families dining there. Awesome place!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and gourmet. This restaurant provides anything from breakfast, brunch, dinner, snacks, dessert, and ice cream. It's a great place for health nuts too, with many gluten free options, etc. Every dish is lovely to look at also, even the oatmeal is amazing and gourmet. The gluten free blue corn pancakes are great too. The workers are extremely attentive and friendly, and the architecture/ ambiance is absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"The resort is definitely a 5 star resort. I would expect similar from their restaurants. Talavera definitely delivered. Proof did not. Service was not good and food was not what I expected. Potatoes, bacon, sausage, waffles were cold. Basically anything that should be served warm was cold. Server was terrible.   Took 10 minutes for him to come over. Then I had to ask all the questions instead of him explaining the options. Then waited for the check. When our server hadn't come by, another took the initiative and grabbed our checked.   Came back and let me know gratuity of 18% was included. No wonder it was terrible service, he was already guaranteed 18%. I made a comment about bad service  to the other server who laughed. I would too because he was thinking \"sucker just paid $28 for each person for cold food and another 18% for terrible service.\""}
{"text":"We had friends in town for the weekend and decided to take them to Proof for dinner and drinks since our first experience there had been so great. The second time did not disappoint!   We started with a round of appetizers that included the pretzels with cheese, fried green tomatoes and the off-menu fried pickles. GET THE PICKLES!!!   For our main courses 2 of us shared the lobster roll with the most amazing onion rings, 2 others shared the beer can chicken, a burger with fried bacon! was enjoyed by another and lastly one ordered the chicken and waffles that comes with candied bacon brittle, house made hot sauce that was so good I wish they bottled and sold it and a syrup that he said was also very good.   We couldn't leave without ordering a few desserts to share. The table ordered the turtle cheesecake, the cookies and cream shake and a scoop of salted caramel ice cream. The turtle cheesecake and shake were awesome and the ice cream was very creamy and tasted great.   The chef came out as we were finishing to ask us what we thought of our meal. He was so nice and genuinely wanted to know how our experience was.   We will be taking all of our out of town guests here to experience the fun, laid back atmosphere, delicious food, excellent service and amazing views!"}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere that you would not expect would be so not intimidating for such a posh hotel. Not normally my type of hang out but was pleasantly surprised when I met my relatives for breakfast.  My BLT with fried egg was not cooked to my liking but the manager quickly had the kitchen remake and then they took my meal off the bill which was unnecessary, but much appreciated.  Next time family is in town I will make sure we return!  Looks like a fun spot for happy hour !"}
{"text":"The atmosphere here is great!  So many interesting things to look at and a great view to boot. We came for lunch and were a little disappointed in the lack of choices on the menu. The food was just okay, nothing riveting, and certainly not worth the high price. $120 for lunch for 2 and a toddler. We will probably come back just for drinks because it is the closest place to our house."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast, lunch, and dinner at Proof while we stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel. Each meal was unique, satisfying, and the staff was overwhlemingly accomodating to change on our orders, service, etc.  the breakfast was fresh and some of the best OJ i have ever experienced. the dinner was equally fine and the desert was unbelivable.  can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We came to Proof a few times while staying at the Four Seasons.  The first time for dinner the service was very slow (30 minutes for an appetizer and then another 20 for some sandwiches) and the restaurant wasn't even busy.  It also took 10 minutes for the hostess to seat us, she walked away twice for no apparent reason.  The food was ok, I had the pulled pork... my neighborhood bar serves much better.  Despite the slow service the first time we came back for breakfast later in our stay.  We came right as they opened at 7am so the service was much better (the place was empty).  I enjoyed the citrus waffle.  My wife wasn't a fan of the pancakes she got.  We came back one final time in the middle of the afternoon to get some ice cream to-go.  The restaurant was nearly empty but it still took fifteen minutes for the chef to come out and slowly scoop together a pair of ice cream cones.  Apparently the waiters/hostess can't handle an ice cream scoop and need to wait for the head chef to come out."}
{"text":"Do not come here if you want good service.  My wife and I decided to come here for dinner tonight and we left afer 15min and went to SASSI instead.  First the hostess did no greet us when we walked and looked very flustered, there was only one party in front of us and the place was not busy.  Then they tried to stick us with the table next to the kitchen although other tables were available so we refused and moved to a different table.  Then we sat for 10min and no one came to us to offer water or get our order.  People sat behind us got their drinks so we left.  So much for Four Seasons quality of service ....."}
{"text":"Excellent choice if your near Pinnacle Peak.  Nice menu and beautiful views!  We have been here a few times. Mostly for lunch."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying I'm from chicago. Service was really good. Atmosphere is amazing. The views, you can't beat. The food - eh. I've eaten four meals here. \"Best\" burger is just fine. Eggs Benedict subpar. Chop and pop salad I really liked. Grilled cheese and tomato soup- ok. Lobster roll....I have a suspicion that it is only half \"Maine\" lobster and half imitation but I couldn't really tell. Very mayo heavy and didn't come with any butter. Bun was great and homemade and their BBQ chips are good. I'm not sure why they are so sea food heavy here, maybe because it's the four seasons and they're trying to be different in a geographic location where seafood is typically not great? It's also VeRY expensive. A coke is $5. Beer is reasonable. Go here on a date and sit on the patio"}
{"text":"Come for the food, but stay for her hospitality. If you live in the area and haven't been to Proof yet, you are missing out big time. The space is fun and relaxed, the staff is incredible, and the food is absolutely AMAZING. The chicken and waffles were by far the best I have ever had. EVER. The chicken was extremely juicy throughout, and had an incredible flavor. The dish is served with peach bourbon syrup, cayenne maple butter and.... Bacon Brittle!! This is definitely the standard by which all future chicken and waffles will be held. If you are dining in the evening, definitely grab a seat outside. The sunsets here are fantastic, and definitely add to the whole experience. In my opinion, what really makes or breaks any restaurant is the staff. And I must say that this place has the right staff to really round out the whole dining experience. If you come by Proof, please ask for Abrielle. She is by far the best restaurant staff member I have ever had the privilege of  encountering. She has an amazing and welcoming personality that wins you over at 'hello'.  I hope the team at Proof realizes how fantastic Abrielle is. Don't miss out on Proof!  P.S. Try the BBQ bites. Tender BBQ ribs in a house made Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce!!! Game changer!"}
{"text":"I had an anniversary dinner here on July 4. All foods were great. Service was excellent ! Manager comes to every table to make sure everything is fine. Thank you very much for the perfect evening:)"}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant with awesome food and a beautiful atmosphere. I've been here for brunch several times with family, and the food is never less than amazing, the service always stellar. We've also had the brunch buffet and that is insanely good - tons of options and everything fresh with lovely presentation.  A bunch of my family members love the bloody mary's. Can't say enough awesome things!"}
{"text":"This is my second time time dining at proof restaurant at the four seasons. All around it was a great environment the workers were very kind and, the restaurant had a nice western look that brought out the colors within the restaurant which made it a great dining area. First time I dined here I had the breakfast buffet and sat outside. Great service waiter checked in with us frequently and was all around great. But for my second time I had dinner here. Food was really overpriced, took 20 min till they got my tables drinks. Asked for the children's menu multiple times took about 20 till they finally brought it over. Our waiter stopped serving us half way through the meal food was cold and on top of everything the waiting time was extremely horrendous if I wanted better service I could've went to the Chinese place down the road. Had to send the food back because they didn't put the right toppings on my burger and was dry. Giving it 3 stars because the workers were very nice and respectful and the food was pretty good. But for a five star resort this place really needs some work."}
{"text":"Everything from the breakfast to the dinner was delicious. The losbter roll and the pulled pork sandwich was divine ! Service was great! The waiters there are very attentive ,  They make sure they get your order just right . Not the mention the views when you dine outdoors are spectacular.  Needless to say you cant go wrong when you eat at Proof ! Try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Another great restaurant at the Four Seasons.  We saw them smoking the pork the day before  Taco Tuesday, so we had to go!  Great smoked pork chunks and all the fixin's on small soft tortilla shells.  Plenty of gaucamole too.  Ran out of shells so they gladly gave me more.  Wife had smoked duck salad which was very good.  Mostly arugala and duck, needed something else in it to give it more interest and color.  Had a great beer from Sedona brewery.  Outdoor table very nice on a warm night.  Great ambience, would go back again!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is excellent! Unique route 66 theme/decor, beautiful Arizona sunset patio views, friendly staff, fabulous service, and food to die for! They offer a wonderful weekend brunch (7:00am-1130am) and 2 for 1 sundaes on Sundays (3:00pm-5:30pm). Alcoholic milkshakes for adults and cute vintage food trays for the kiddos. A fun outing for all!  Try the pretzel knots- warm, gooey, with a spicy cheese sauce from the heavens. My favorite entree is the chop & pop salad. Popcorn instead of croutons?! Delicious! And for dessert, you really can't go wrong. Although, the cerealist milkshake might just be the best thing ever created."}
{"text":"If you are in the mood for \"comfort\" foods and sweets, try Proof's variations on traditional menu items.  I have not been disappointed at my dining experiences here.  The atmosphere is casual and fun, with dining either indoors or outside in the patio.  For evenings and weekends, I recommend making reservations.  At this visit, I enjoyed their Southwest Corn Bisque, a mildly sweet pureed soup topped with black beans.  Of course, I had their Proof Burger which is cooked to order.  The patty was most and flavorful, and accompanied by my selection of fries.  You can substitute onion rings or other sides.  My family ordered the Crab Mac 'N' Cheese, and I tried a helping.  You can order it as an entree.  I may next time!  It was superb, with its King crab and Danish Dill Havarti cheese.  Others in my party had the Superfood Salad which contained a tasteful combination of heirloom tomatoes, baby eggplant, ancient grains, and goat quark (a soft curd cheese), mixed with a vinaigrette dressing.  Save room for dessert.  They have a separate menu of candies and sweets!  I selected my usual root beer float."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why this place gets such good reviews. We stayed at the Four Seasons and ate here 4 times. Three times for breakfast and once for dinner. The food is mediocre and the service is poor. Every meal had service issues. The wait time for the waiter was extremely long for one meal,waiters very infrequently checked back to the table, I was mischarged for one meal, and for one breakfast I had to wait 40 minutes for an omelet. The rest of my family had visited the breakfast buffet twice, finished their meals and were waiting for me. The server just kept walking by ignoring that I had not not gotten my food. They really need to improve the service quality. Since this is the best option for meals at the hotel, and there aren't a lot of options near by, we probably won't be visiting The Four Seasons again."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place. The service is great, the atmosphere is so unique, and the food is amazing! Every time I think I've found a favorite menu item, I try a new awesome item. My current favorite is the gluten free french toast. They are sweet with a hint of lemon. Yum!"}
{"text":"Overpriced bland food.  This is the Four Seasons.  I'm ok spending more money in a place like this but it should be gourmet.  No reason to come back to this place."}
{"text":"Made an early reservation at Proof for a birthday dinner for my mother in law.  We had a perfect seat overlooking the beautifully landscaped Four Seasons & mountainous views all around.  Actually, any seat outside is spectacular, you can't go wrong!  We recently moved to Cave Creek from the North East (Connecticut).  I ordered the pomegranate glazed salmon.  I usually take pictures of my food but instead wanted to enjoy the company and the scenery of the evening.  Perfect food choices from the Deviled Eggs, Salmon entree right down to the dessert.  Make sure you save room for their homemade pies and ice cream.  I enjoyed the S'mores sundae with graham crackers!  Yum Yum!  Lovely evening from the attentive service right down to the food!    Unbeatable value for the price as well as the breathtaking Sonoran desert views.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"How refreshing to have a good old fashioned American style restaurant in the area!  From traditional milkshake making machines to a soda jerk station & drink menus inside of a license plate jacket...the focus is definitely on an American theme. I ordered a Shrimp Pop' Boy sandwich which included more than enough shrimp on a delightfully fresh baguette & a mixed green salad.  The wait staff is still clearly learning the ropes, but very service oriented & eager to please.  Hubby ordered the pulled pork sandwich & requested gluten free bread with hand cut fries.  He almost licked his plate!  The French fries were to die for...wish I had ordered them instead of the mixed green salad!  OK, the prices are a little higher than some place like Red Robin, but they use the freshest, locally made ingredients & make their own ice cream, which isn't full of stabilizers & other crap. Plus, it IS part of the Four Seasons resort, so one would expect the the prices & quality to be higher, both successfully accomplished!  I was given a sample of their home made peppermint patty, which is used in some of their desserts...I thought I had died & gone to heaven!  The chocolate was divine & the filling was lovely & creamy.  I suggested they just add a plate of those to their menu, for folks who were too full to consume a milkshake...hope they do!  I will definitely be back & am anxious to try the lobster roll!"}
{"text":"The pretzels are amazing. The service was fantastic. Great cocktails.  More of a lunch spot than dinner, had a very relaxed feel but attention and service of any four seasons establishment."}
{"text":"Great food. Beautiful ideas. Gluten-free? Sign me up!   But the price tag. Ugh, I loathe when something warms your heart but the bill turns it back to ice.   $5 for an egg. $6 for a biscuit. $6 for. a. cup. of. coffee. $20 FOR A STEAK AND EGG SCRAMBLE!????   No. Just, no. It's silly, it's exorbitant, & it's exploitative.  So no. Never ever ever going back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!  Friendly staff, fantastic food and super family friendly.  The menu is diverse and has something for everyone.  The view is also great, especially at sunset.  The new Tiki Thursday is fun and has a great drink menu.  My kids love hitting the candy bar after dinner!  All around good time!"}
{"text":"Proof is an incredible restaurant at the Four Seasons Hotel. The view is gorgeous, the food was delectable, and the service was more than wonderful. We went here for my wife's birthday and they brought out a complimentary sundae for us to split!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! We've been at the Four Seasons for one day and have already eaten at Proof twice. Having visited FS Scottsdale since 2003, we found Crescent Moon to be decent. However, Proof has proven to be wonderfully fresh and modern. The Chop and Pop truly stands out. The B.L.A.T.T sandwich was incredible!! Dessert was delicious. The drink menu, thorough. plus, service has been friendly and efficient. I'm so happy we're here for another 5 days so we can try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing place!! We spent some time at the desert and it was really nice to be in a place that shows and feels the American culture. Everything there is made in the USA. Service was very attentive and friendly. Food was delicious. We started with the pretzel deep in cheese, I had a burger and my wife had a shrimp and grits. Definitely a place to check it out while in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate at Proof twice in our stay at Four Seasons Scottsdale at Troon North. Both times the food was outstanding! The pretzel knots were recommended by the front desk staff and did not disappoint! At dinner I ordered the NY strip which was smoked and finished with flames. The morrel cream sauce was a great accompaniment. I picked off the peas because I'm an immature adult. My guy is a chicken and waffles fiend and he said theirs was definitely one of the best he's had. The duck confit truffle frites were scrumptious and we topped it off with a devil's food milkshake. Breakfast the next morning was cowboy benedict and huevos rachevos.Both were superb. The food and atmosphere were great but what stands out the most like everything else Four Seasons is the service. Giovanni was our server for dinner and I can't say enough good things about him. He made great recommendations, was amazingly attentive not just to us but every table he served. He made a fabulous meal even better. Needless to say, Proof is on the agenda next time I find myself in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"In short: Garish and fake interior design, over-priced and underwhelming food, and inattention to curation of ambience. To expand upon this: first, the interior design is a failed attempt at an authentic aesthetic -- the exposed ductwork is obviously unnecessary and details such as the bathroom sinks and faucets reveal the true nature of this establishment (that of gaudy luxury masquerading as authentic craftsmanship). Second, the ambience was seriously lacking, which is really a monumental letdown considering the setting of this establishment -- how hard could it be to play soft music, dim the lights, and let the landscape speak for itself... apparently it's over their heads. Next, and most importantly, the food was lackluster at best -- the side dishes were under-seasoned, if even seasoned at all -- the salads were over-dressed (note to chef: if I'm getting a health-conscious grain salad its guaranteed that I don't want it smothered in a sweet dressing), and the entrees... actually i didn't even bother cause the only vegetarian entree was a stuffed chili which is stupid boring. Lastly, the service was unsophisticated, but maybe I'm just still annoyed that he pulled away my $20 salad with 1/3 of the plate still left (though I was really struggling to find it palatable at that point in the meal), or maybe I just didn't appreciate their \"casual\" approach to service. All in all, I definitely won't return"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful Friday night meal seated at the corner of the lower patio overlooking the resort, mountains, and city lights to the south. The service was spot on, very helpful, and I plan on returning many times in the future"}
{"text":"Unpretentious and comfortable!!!! Great food concept and laid back atmosphere!!!! Amazing views and an incredible option when dining at a Four Seasons' restaurant and you want a casual evening!!!!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place to relax, get breakfast and enjoy the lovely desert view. It is a bit pricey but it's very laid-back and unpretentious. I rarely eat carbs but I made an exception and ordered the ricotta and blue corn pancakes with blueberry compote and they were very good (I didn't think they even needed syrup on them). My brother got the buffet and everything he brought back looked fantastic. The service very good.   I highly recommend coming here on a nice day for breakfast."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum!!!!  Love this restaurant. Great beers on tap-great drinks and the food is fantastic!!  If chef Jesse is working there is a secret menu item he will make for you if you ask nicely--fried pickles and they are to die for!  We had 3 unbelievable entrees---the meatloaf, the chicken and waffles and the burger. All three were so different but melt in your mouth delicious. I would order any one of those entrees again in a heart beat! We were too full for dessert but I'm sure that it would have been wonderful."}
{"text":"I wish we'd had a better experience because it is very near our house, but...while we liked the food and wine, the staff here really wouldn't cut it at any of the other Four Seasons we've visited. We arrived a little after 5 p.m. and there were only a handful of people in the place. After being ignored by the hostess, who was on the phone...and who then took yet another call while we waited...another hostess finally came by to help, informing us that we could sit at a table in the dining room \"as long as you're out by 7\"...now I know the tables might be reserved, but the lack of tact was not the Four Seasons as we know it!  Other than that, there was a lot to like. Our waiter was very competent. The house pinot noir is lovely. The lobster devilled eggs were our favorite, but we also liked the short rib bites. The duck fries weren't as good as we'd expected -- not enough duck meat.  If they ditch the women who staff the hostess stand or invest in some staff training, we'd probably be back -- especially in the winter when you can sit on the patio and enjoy fab views."}
{"text":"5 stars for atmosphere and service but the food is overpriced (but it's the four seasons). The food is good (not great) but I do like that the menu is ever changing. Some things are always there but I think they do a good job of swapping foods for the seasons! The pretzel knots are delicious and I usually get the salmon entree and I've been happy with all the different preparations I've had! But the view and atmosphere are what make this restaurant a favorite!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and I had chicken sandwich which was great, my sister had the short ribs with the most amazing bbq sauce made with Dr. Pepper. Delicious!  Good selection of wine and a great spot, too bad it was too hot to sit outside but patio looked great too.  Did I mention they have an old school ice cream parlor setup in there as well? Yum!  Even if you are not staying at the hotel I'd definitely check this place out. Great views!"}
{"text":"Come for the views, stay for the food and excellent service! My boyfriend and I came to Proof for both dinner and brunch over our one night stay at the resort and it definetly did not disappoint. For dinner, we ordered the fried green tomatoes as a starter and it had to be one of the most excellent vegetable appetizers I've ever had. All the produce throughout the meal was extremely fresh, as if they get it from local growers. The only problem we ran into was we both ordered our steak medium-rare and they came out well done. We sent the steaks back, and in only a few minutes were presented with new, medium-rare steaks. The manager took control to correct or order and even comped our 1st round of drinks! The waiters were pretty busy but make time to chat with you and make you feel like an important guest."}
{"text":"First time here. Restaurant reincarnation from a former family restaurant at the Four Seasons Troon.  Ordered 4 beer samplers which unfortunately came we'll after our appetizer pretzel knots were consumed - I assume the wait staff were overwhelmed by the Saturday crowd but replacement knots were brought for us as appeasement. The meals: lobster roll, hamburger, salmon were excellent. Remember this is not a cheap place to eat so expect to drop some coin.  The waiter, named Tony felt so bad about the delay in our drinks, he provided us milkshakes which truly exemplified the $5 milkshakes talked about in Pulp Fiction - they were delicious. He also packed us up to go with hot chocolate chip cookies - fantastic, I will be back."}
{"text":"Epic about sums it up. This is the more casual restaurant at The Four Seasons resort. The views of Pinnacle Peak are unmatched and the food is also incredible. The burger is simply off the charts. but then again, with deep fried Nueske bacon and bourbon molasses carmelized onions how can you wrong?"}
{"text":"Excellent \"tulip-cut\" chicken wings.  If you don't eat wings because they are too messy, the \"tulip-cut\" wings are like lollipops! No mess! Pretzel knots are great.  Other great items we enjoyed were:  BBQ rib bites, Goat Cheese Roasted Cauliflower, bell pepper rings, shrimp and grits, hamburger and smoked babe on a bun (pulled pork).  Definitely a great restaurant."}
{"text":"I was expecting higher quality food for the almost insane price that they charged us. I was really hoping that it would be well worth the cost but, trust me when I say it wasn't. Although their pretzel knots were delightful, they were a bit greasy. I can certainly order a better batch at culinary dropout whom I don't give care much for either. The portions were too small. The food was average at most. Nothing stood out to us. Service was okay, nothing too outstanding. It was slow although there weren't too much customers in. Oh well, I guess you will just have to try and see for yourself."}
{"text":"Unbelievable! Our $19 hamburger had to go back and.......came back worse! My BLT bread was so greasy from the grill it matched the homemade bacon! Really need to revamp the chef/ prices for it's a small fortune to stay here. (Great concept for interior however!)"}
{"text":"Having a place like Proof \"out here\" is like having a corner bar in the neighborhood, with valet parking. The staff become friends, the food is good - comfort food! A and its close to home. For those having to drive up this way - it's worth it! Always save room for dessert"}
{"text":"Stay away from $19.00 burger. Expected something amazing and was served a ho-hum ordinary burger. #underwhelmed."}
{"text":"I pride myself on being a serious foodie and this may be one of BEST sandwiches I've EVER eaten. Pork belly. Egg. Avocado. Lettuce. Tomato. Az cheddar. Housemade sausage. Mustard aioli on Pretzel bun #proof #fourseasonstroonnorth #foodie #foodgasm #jumbobreakfastsandwich"}
{"text":"Although a chilly evening, patio dining was perfectly comfortable with electric heaters strategically placed in the ceiling above. Oversized scarves/wraps were available if necessary. Love that extra touch!   Appetizers:  Fried Green Tomatoes w/ Crab Remoulade and BBQ Rib Bites. The tomatoes were heirloom which I think stood up well to the cornmeal and frying. The flavors were great, but I think the portion size was a little on the skimpy side. Definitely wasn't large enough to share alone. The rib bites were served in a small cast iron skillet. These babies were fall-off-the-bone tender and very flavorful. I had to hold back to save room for dinner!   Dinner: I ordered the Chicken And Waffles w/ Bacon Brittle, Peach Bourbon Syrup, Cayenne Maple Butter.   Let me just say...I consider myself somewhat of a connoisseur when it comes to chicken and waffles...and Chef Jesse got it right on the money!! If you prefer BONELESS fried chicken on a BELGIAN waffle...go elsewhere for the Gringo version. But if you want an AUTHENTIC Southern preparation and flavors with an updated twist, this is the place!  The chicken had a substantial, crispy batter and the meat was juicy and tender on the inside. It was served on top of a large, thin & tender waffle. But what made this dish extra special (can I underline extra special?) was the bacon brittle garnish and the cayenne maple butter. The cayenne butter replaced the hot sauce that I would have normally requested. It was buttery, spicy and perfectly balanced to the sweet bourbon syrup. And since I was going all out- I ordered the ham hock southern greens on the side. They were smokey, tender and very flavorful. I would have preferred a TAD bit of pot liquor though. \"Pot liquor\" is the seasoned liquid left after boiling greens. Otherwise, I was impressed Chef Jesse! Very impressed!   My colleague ordered the Blackened Salmon with Mixed Greens and Crispy Grit Croutons. In case you don't know what grits are, its just hominy. Sister to polenta. How cool of the Chef to make croutons out of it. Wow! I didn't try this dish personally, but let's just say he practically licked the plate.   Wine: Try the 2009 Iconoclast Cabernet. Great value by the bottle and incredibly smooth.   Desert: Spiked Root Beer Float. To my surprise, it was served with big nut-less brownie bites on top. Took me back to being a kid!   I thought the atmosphere was warm and inviting...buzzing even. It was family and group friendly. The server's uniforms were attractive and the service was very friendly.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had lunch here and it was good-not amazing. Vegetarian grain dish had potential but too much oil. Salmon was fishy so not pleasant. Nothing memorable here."}
{"text":"Second time here for dinner; we had Shrimp & Grits and a Lobster Roll. Both were Excellent!!  We started with the Duck confit fries with Truffle Cheese Sauce which was very good. Moscow Mule to end the evening.  DEFINITELY coming back for a third visit! :)"}
{"text":"Came here again because we couldn't stop thinking about how great the breakfast was!!! This time I ate the Benny Went to New England but with bacon and it was DELICIOUS, I LOVED the hollandaise sauce with crab! My husband ate the Huevos Rancheros. Everything was outstanding!!! This time I had my own tomato bacon jam to devour and I did! Love this place!!! Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I love this venue. Always a warm atmosphere with welcoming service. I've tried many things on their lunch menu and have never been disappointed. Today I had the chicken Waldorf sandwich. Wow! The bread alone is awesome. I asked my waitress how I order my side salad as a whole salad next time. It was super good...it's a smaller version of the Arizona salad.   I brought a friend with me today and she's blown away! She got the turkey burger and said it's juiciest turkey burger she's ever had.  And the shakes....well I recommend any of them. But don't leave without getting one. Hand-crafted and original. The floats are great too.  I recommended Proof to anyone. Casual atmosphere and great for kids too."}
{"text":"In the far northeast corner of Scottsdale sits a Four Season Resort, with fabulous views of Pinnacle Peak and the surrounding mountains.  Their \"casual\" restaurant (serves breakfast, lunch and dinner) is the Proof Canteen.  We had a dinner there the other night, with heaters blasting to ward off the evening chill.  While the prices were not \"cheap,\" (hey, this is the Four Seasons, remember?), they were not at a level that would cause you to take out a second mortgage or a payday loan.  I was in carvnivore mode so ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries.  My lovely bride, in full carnivoress mode, ordered the meatloaf.  Each of these was $21 and a full menu of craft beers from Arizona sources, plus various wines and cocktails was available at reasonable prices.  Our only debate was whose entree was better.  I will get the meatloaf next time, but the burger was right up there with ones you would get at a place like the Capital Grill.  The appetizer menu looked attractive also, but we wisely decided we likely could not add appetizers to our repast without carting home a boatload of doggie bags.  We shared a dessert of Triple Layer Chocolate Toffee Crumble Cake, a bit of heaven for a chocaholic.  The only sad note is that we were too late to catch the sunset, which we were told are often sublime.  We look forward to a return visit for breakfast and/or brunch, as a number of those items looked fantastic.  You do need reservations for dinner, but coming after 8 p.m., the place was not crowded.  The inside of the restaurant had loads of TVs, so I now know where I want to be for March Madness!"}
{"text":"Wait-was this at the Four Seasons? Like the service oriented great hotel brand?  You could never have guessed it by the service at this place. Did they forget to train the staff at this place, especially the hostesses? It was the second time we tried this place. The first time was a week or two after it opened.  So I made a reservation via open table, 1 week in advance. Just for 2. They called me (from the actual restaurant) 1 day before to confirm my reservation. We show up, oh sorry, we have no reservation listed. Plus the hostess with nervous energy let us wait while she straightened papers to sort out the problem. Like really? I did explain, I got a reminder via open table and a you guys actually called me. She said well, sometimes the computer messes up-you fare not in here, but we will find you a table.   Whatever.  The menu hasn't evolved, which is a shame. And who designed the menu??? A junior designer out of art school? Our waiter was friendly and accommodating.  So then a get a call on my phone asking if I am still at the restaurant-because I left my credit card at the table. (this is while I am still eating and waiting for main courses). So explain this to me: How do you not have my reservation when I show up, but somehow you found me in your reservation pile located in the deep crevices of your computer to call me, but didn't realize I was eating at your restaurant. And this is the hostess calling me.  So anyway-we did get a nice sunset view but I think we are done trying out this place. Is it that hard to get decent restaurant service training? Especially for hostesses?"}
{"text":"Came to Scottsdale for the 4th of July weekend. Third night here and couldn't find a really good spot to brag about. We thought proof would be a top notch little hidden place, I'm sad to say this place was disappointed us as well. We orders some beers and the sun devil mule, which were great. The butcher board was fabulous. As we go on with the entrees we were left disappointed. We tried the \"exceptional\" waffle and chicken. The chicken was too salty and tasted like old chicken. The waffle was not tasty, it came out soggy and fell flat. We then order the super food salad with steak. The salad was okay although the dressing was too runny. The steak was okay was nicely spiced. We then ended the night with some ice cream, they claimed was hand crafted. The ice cream tasted like store brought ice cream. The service was 5 stars too bad the quality of the food fell short. Really thought this place was going to be a hit."}
{"text":"The service is great; the view is amazing. Drinks are expensive, but good. The lobster roll was really good. The pretzel knots were the best part of the meal."}
{"text":"We've eaten at Proof probably 10 times over the past two years (clustered in a few trips). We've had breakfast, lunch, and dinner there multiple times. We've never once had a less than great experience. The food is always solid, the drinks are well-made, and the service is friendly and efficient.  The one item we ALWAYS have to get is the pretzel knots. Everything else we've tried has been good, but it's the pretzel knots that keep us coming back."}
{"text":"Nice people and average food quality. Had the Artic Chard and tasted a little of everyone elses dishes. Everything was cooked nice but it was just so so. Pretty much what you would expect from a Resort Cafe. Overpriced."}
{"text":"We love the 4 Seasons Resort and we live less than two miles away from it.  I have spent several times at the Onyx bar, the Spa and some of the other facilities, but I haven't been to this restaurant before.  What a fun place!  The ambiance is really nice, relaxed and casual.  There is a shuffle board at the entrance, which seems fun.  There was a group of people enjoying it while we were there.  Everything about our meal was fantastic.  My friend ordered the butternut squash soup, it came with crusty bread topped with brie, pistachios and cranberries.  Everyone was raving about it, I was the only one who didn't taste it because I am avoiding refined carbs right now.  Of the two slices, my friend ended up enjoying 1/2 a slice since my husband and her fiancé ate the rest.  My husband had the Short Ribs, her fiancé had the St. Louis style ribs, I had the Arizona Grown salad with grilled chicken added.  My grilled chicken was deliciously seasoned and my salad was very satisfying, it had some roasted brussels sprouts and cauliflower as well as mixed greens.  My friend had the salmon, I had a bit of it and it was perfectly cook, so tender.  My husband had a C is for Cookie milkshake, everyone commented that it was amazing.  Overall this was a fantastic night, I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"First visit this evening & it's def not my last. Wow! Chef Jesse knows his food game here. It may be far for most but it's a great place to indulge in comfort food at its finest. We had an array of apps to start: pretzel knots that taste almost like challah bread, fantastic! Mussels in a spicy coconut curry, portobello shrooms in a gruyere sauce & fried green tomatoes were perfection. I opted for chicken & waffles & they were to die! The porchetta special was a stand-out as well. Just go & taste why this is one of AZ's finest."}
{"text":"Wow...was this place well done - I would like to hire this designer because they hit the nail on the head!  I could hang out at Proof every single day...beautiful inside and a nice patio too.  The pretzels were to die for and the drinks were amazing.  We checked out the menu and definitely want to come back and dine here as well.  The bartender was amazing and made the visit even more enjoyable - thanks for a great experience!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out last Sunday. We had been up to Four Seasons before to check out the view and get some drinks, and we liked it, so when we heard about Proof opening there, we wanted to go check it out. We liked it except for the prices. They had a great bottle selection, and an ok tap list (although I was disappointed the beer I ordered on tap had been replace with something else). My boyfriend was impressed that they had Pappy Van Winkle available. The food was really yummy, and we were able to order a Monte Cristo for brunch and split it and it was plenty of food. They even split it on two plates for us (great presentation!). However, we couldn't believe that when we ordered their donut holes - we only got 3 donut holes for $8! What a rip-off. Good food, decent beer selection, but definitely overpriced for what you get. Also, parking was very confusing. It's quite a hike if you park in the lot, but you can valet and I think we accidentally parked in the valet lot."}
{"text":"Can you put a price on a breathtaking view? Apparently you can and it is $30 for an omelette and an ice tea. With that said though, it was a fabulous omelette, the restaurant is in the middle of the Four Seasons Resort and the view from the patio could be used by the Chamber of Commerce to inspire people to come visit Scottsdale or at least remind people who live here that our chosen home is spectacularly beautiful.  Seriously, the omelette was among the best that I have ever had. The eggs were fluffy and every bite was chock full of all of the goodies that I got to select from on their extensive list of choices. The hash brown side dish was not bad but what set it into the stratosphere was the tomato-bacon \"jam\" on top of it. I could eat the jam by the spoonful.  The inside of the restaurant is a faux haute western theme, \"authentic\" right down to the leather smell that they must pipe in. Makes you want to saunter up to the bar and order a sarsaparilla (wearing $300 jeans)."}
{"text":"This restaurant is awesome. We live in the neighborhood  and go there 2x weekly. The food is delicious....service is really great..we're regulars of course And they treat us that way!  Try the ginger mule drink and you'll have 2 or 3! We've had everything on the menu and you can't go wrong.  We take guests all the time and they love the patio and views.  The old restaurant here was bad...very bad, but Proof is a hit."}
{"text":"I want to start this review with a disclaimer about myself - I do not like to push negativity into the world; I'm not an internet troll, and if I dislike an establishment, I will - 99% of the time - give it a 2nd chance. But this experience was so negative, I had to be honest.   My husband and I arrived on a Friday around 6 - past happy hour, and before dinner hour really gets rolling. No reservation, but I mean, see above... It was not busy.  I wanted a seat on the patio to enjoy the views and sunset and they brought us out to a weird cramped seat in the corner with no views, so I requested another table that was more out in the open. It was reserved... as well as (apparently) everything else outside, so we were seated inside. Still... big windows, wide open doors, it was fine. I just wanted a glass of wine with a view, it had been a tough week. The first (of many MANY people) to approach us was the \"serving assistant\" (really??) asking what kind of water we wanted - sparkling or \"house filtered\" ... so, tap water? Sure, we'll have that, thanks. Typically I would have laughed this off because it's just so silly! But I was already annoyed by their inability to give 2 people a decent outdoor seat on a mostly unoccupied patio, so I found that having a serving assistant was A BIT pretentious.  Now, this is NOT a white tablecloth kind of place, the pretension was unwarranted. The servers are in cowboy boots and plaid shirts. I realize it's the Four Seasons, I get it. But it's the bar, not their main dining room. Take it down a notch so people can relax!   The server himself was lovely, helpful, friendly, etc. everything you want in a server. No complaints there.  A 3rd person delivered our drinks. Another assistant or runner? Who knows. So many bodies.  The wine list was not spectacular - I would have expected much more from the ostentatious show the staff was providing.  The white wines are only CA domestic; not a single New Zealand Sav Blanc to be found. Fine. Red it is - you can't really mess up a California red.  It was only OK. Disappointing.   So, on to the food. At this point we decided we would try one appetizer and make a stay-or-go decision from that. We ordered the chili dip and it was not great. Maybe something Chili's would serve. Tasty but way too greasy. I liked the chicharrone chips they served with it but my husband did not. Overall, thumbs down.   In addition to the server and 2 assistants who came by, 2 other bussers were ALL OVER clearing our plates and glasses, before anything was really finished. Now I'm steaming. All I wanted was a nice place with a view to have a glass of wine with my husband and discuss the week and family events. We could barely talk about the food much less family events, with all the COMPLETELY UNECSSARY interruptions. Certainly, we felt rushed to vacate their table, but at that point I was more than happy to oblige.   I'm very generous with my reviews, and not stingy with the stars - I don't demand a lot, but when it's one thing after another, the entire experience is ruined. There are way too many beautiful patios-with-views establishments in Scottsdale to waste our time on this one.  We won't be back here."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place more I just can't.  I wish the food were a little healthier and the menu more diverse.  Buy one get one free sundae happy hour though is absolutely unbeatable.  Unbeatable.  Amazing upgraded premium sundaes.  Love the ambiance though and playing shuffleboard is always good."}
{"text":"Upon our arrival, I was afraid that Proof would be one of those places that is overly expensive and the servings would be meager. Boy, was I wrong! Not only were the portions plentiful but actually a great deal for the price! We ordered the duck fries (their take on poutine) which was enough food for 4-5 people.  We also ordered the Chop and Pop salad which was so interesting with the popcorn.  My husband and I shared the 1/2 portion of the beer can chicken. My husband loved it and I would have too except my chicken (dark meat) was a little dry.  Finally for my drink, I ordered the Clint Eastwood which is one of their creations.  The waitress served it by pouring it into a snifter and there was smoke rising from it! One of the most delicious smoky drinks I've ever had!!!  On top of all that, the view of the sunset over the mountains just made it a perfect meal."}
{"text":"Subpar! Feels like a Cracker Barrel that serves dinner. Not worth $. Menu was POORLY executed! Sounded good on paper (& that's a stretch) tasted horrid!  I would expect better from a Four Seasons..."}
{"text":"This is one of several restaurants at the Four Seasons and the ambience is so cool...very western. It has outdoor seating and happy hour specials with a license plate menu. I ordered the lobster roll, because I'm from Maine and it sounded good. Now, you might think \"lobster in the desert\"? But let me tell you, it was as good, or better, than any I've had near water's edge. Big chunks of lobster mixed with Old Bay mayo on a bed of butter lettuce atop a softly toasted hot dog bun with a side of perfectly crisped fries. I had a light IPA draft beer with it and it was heavenly. I sat outside and the staff was attentive to be sure I got sun/shade, depending on my preference.  The service at Four Seasons is top notch and I enjoyed chatting with the staff and appreciated their recommendations.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"One word: Phenomenal!  The atmosphere, the food, the waitstaff: it's all terrific. Had the pleasure of dining here for a late lunch on New Year's Day and sampled their burger and wings. Both were cooked to perfection and were very savory and flavorful. Hope to be back soon :-)"}
{"text":"We came here for Restaurant Week and this was by far my most favorite one we tried (out of four). We were a party of two and were seated at the corner table on the patio so it felt very romantic!  We had the grilled cheese & tomato soup appetizer as well as the pretzel knots, which were both great! The spicy cheese sauce that came with the pretzel knots should be put in a gallon bottle and sold individually for people to take home!  Our entrees were also delicious...roasted chicken and some sort of pork (can't remember what the boy had). My mashed potatoes were creamy but I wasn't a huge fan of the gravy.  The desserts we chose were Death by Chocolate banana split and the Every Berry We Carry pie. I think the banana split was decent. I guess I want more of a traditional banana split as opposed to what they provided. I also wasn't a HUGE fan of the berry pie but I think that's because there was some sort of odd ice cream on top, possibly with basil in it and basil is pretty awful in my opinion.  We'll definitely be back for the chicken and waffles!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service! Every server, manager, busboy, etc was so friendly and accommodating. I wish every restaurant had their work ethic. Definitely recommend the smoked salmon and avocado bread for breakfast. For dinner, the mixed greens salad and Dr. Pepper rib tips were delicious. The Apple cake and caramel popcorn were great for dessert. This place was refreshing to have at the Four Seasons. The person responsible for the concept definitely deserves praise. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"We went to Proof to have dinner. I cannot express how good the service, food and desserts were. My husband had their burger, We Have the Best Burger with a side of onion rings, I had their Chicken and Waffles and our son had mac and cheese, fries, fresh fruit (kids under 4 eat free with a paying adult!!!). Let me tell you, this was SO GOOD. Everything was just above and beyond good. The chicken was fried perfectly, the waffles were a good contrast to the saltiness of the chicken, the mac and cheese was delectable, the fries were seasoned to perfection, onion rings were yummy (a little too much batter) and my husband finished his burger without a sound, so I'm assuming he loved it!   We also had dessert at their ice cream parlor. They make their own ice creams and baked goods!!! Again we were impressed!   Our waitress was so gracious and kind, I wish I had gotten her name! Also, the manager came up to our table various times and talked to our son, asking him abt his Cars, knew the names of Lightening McQueen and Mater!"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with a couple of friends.  One of which is not from Arizona.  For that reason, we chose Proof because the views.  Unfortunately, our views were a little obstructed by over grown trees. :-(  We ordered the tomato soup and the grilled cheese.  It was okay.  I ordered the shrimp and grits.  It was a very filling dish, but nothing really stood out about it.  Perhaps I just ordered the wrong dishes that night.  Service was great."}
{"text":"Proof is a great place to see and be seen if you're in the pretty people club. I'm not.  So chances are, if someone's looking at me, it's because I remind them of a family member who spent time in the joint, or, they're in the early stages of cancer and their life's priorities are so fucked-up and they'd bargain with God to trade my looks for their cancer.  If I'M STARING at the pretty people, I try to be furtive, but almost always get caught since they're pretty and used to being gawked at...their homely-radar typically set to high alert.  So I visit Proof and order the Coor's Banquet, eat their beer-battered onion rings, and a chocolate sundae. I had a burger too and in the end, spent a half week's pay in the process. Then I ordered up a few more beers and spent my Saturday wondering how I got hit by the ugly train as a kid while these folks were molded right out  of the pages of Vogue or Esquire. Sucks. I found solace with the goofy looking  Bell Captain who looked like a French policeman with his little gendarme hat.   The surroundings are beautiful from the patio, the people are fashionistas, and the ambiance in the bar is superb. The servers are so polite, they made me uncomfortable...like they were up to something sneaky. No-one is that polite. Ever.  When you've had enough misery from staring at the women patrons whom you know you simply repulse, you'll go across the street to Greasewood where you'll fit in with folks of your own ilk.  I fit in at Proof like O.J.'s glove."}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to Proof for appetizers at sunset!   The drive to Proof is so beautiful.   Driving from Scottsdale the roads to Proof are desolate and surrounded by the desert.    I like to sit outside on the deck at Proof and look at the surrounding desert mountains and the sun disappearing behind them. I find novelty in walking the dirt path from the front of the resort to access Proof.  When it's dark the resort has fire pits going along the dirt path and it makes me feel so relaxed. Now to the food and drink!  I've never eaten a meal here, but the appetizers are very good.  The pretzel knots are to die for.  They are a cross between a freshly baked crescent roll and a pretzel.  So flaky and yummy and they are served with a delicious jalapeno thyme cheese sauce!   The Dr. Pepper BBQ rib bites are quite tasty as well. I have to admit I go mostly for the scenery and relaxed feeling of sitting in the desert, but the appetizers and drinks are a plus.    The only reason I'm not giving 4 stars is because they were out of the copper cups for our Moscow Mules, and without asking served them to us in a glass.  Just not the same in a glass. Can't wait to see my next sunset here!!"}
{"text":"Last night, my hubs and I wanted to go out to dinner since we were semi-bored and thought it'd be fun to sit out on a patio with gorgeous views. I'd been to Proof quite a few times after hiking Tom's Thumb Trail on weekend mornings but I still had yet to come for dinner, so I could finally meet that Chicken and Waffle dish I've heard so much about. Trust me, I've begged them in the past to make this dish for breakfast because it just makes sense to me that way, but the \"stubborn\" dish remains a dinner time staple!  The Proof Manhattan is one of the best Manhattans we have ever tasted. My favorite cocktail is typically an Old Fashioned but this Proof Manhattan may have changed my mind. I know they are nearly the same except Manhattans have Vermouth, but wow, so good!  The Clint Eastwood Cocktail. Single Proof Russell's Reserve Bourbon. Chocolate bitters. Aged Whiskey Bitters. Tobacco Smoke... All I can say is this cocktail is a powerful one and it burns just like Eastwood's stone cold stare. If this one doesn't put hair on your chest, I'd be surprised. The tobacco smoke is in an upside down glass and the whiskey cocktail is poured quickly into the glass with the smoke. I'm such a nerd and I wish I could be as cool as this cocktail is!   Duck fries. Decadent and rich. Arizona cheese curds and gravy cradled on top of succulent shredded duck with tasty fries.   Beef Short Ribs - Tender beef \"pot roast style\" with marble potatoes, squash, grilled onions and Poblano Corn Biscuit. Not one inch of beef was over cooked. Each piece was soft, familiar flavor, and comforting. The Poblano biscuit, unique in its own right, stood out on the plate and added and extra \"kick\" for the overall flavor of the dish.  Chicken and waffles. Fried chicken perfection almost seems like it was floating over the fluffy buckwheat waffles. Really? Peach compote bacon brittle sprinkled like fairy dust over the fried chicken?! My taste buds stood defeated. Being a \"meat and potatoes type gal,\" I quickly consumed the brittle and chicken first and almost forgot about the waffles. Yes, the waffles were indeed a treat, especially with the smoked blueberry homemade syrup - so much that I didn't even fancy a dessert at the end.   Crab Mac and cheese. I ordered this along with the entrée only because our waiter, Giovanni, asked if we wanted a side with our entrées. But he didn't just ask if we wanted a side. He also provided an example of a side, the Crab Mac and Cheese. Well duh! Of course I can't say no to two perfect things placed together - crab AND Mac and cheese. Yes this was super good but we didn't really \"need\" it since all the other food was filling enough!  Overall, although this was a spur of the moment dinner, we did call to make an 8pm reservation. All our info must have been stored from previous visits in their system it seems because they kept greeting us \"welcome back!\" when we actually arrived. They were so excited because they sat us at a corner table of the patio out looking the beautiful desert sunset. It felt secluded and cozy even though we were outdoors. Our waiter Giovanni and the restaurant manager constantly checked in on us and were so friendly and wonderful to us our entire visit. Our dinner experience really out shined breakfasts here especially with the food. The service is just consistently great regardless of time of day. We love Proof! Yes, like turned into love. That's how relationships work over time.."}
{"text":"Remarkable updated and cool.  Delicious foods (save room for dessert) dozens of craft beers loads of TV's for sports fans but best of all Four Seasons Service. Try it. It's an amazing evolution from the prior Grill."}
{"text":"Went for Father's day. We had the buffet, nice selection. Bloody Mary and grapefruit mimosa were outstanding. Juices were very tasty and fresh. Service was great, very attentive, William was our server.  Next time I will order off the menu, saw some of the dishes going by and they looked delish. Beautiful view. We'll be nice in the Fall out on the patio for happy hour. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went to Proof in the Four Seasons last night for the first time. It is billed as a \"canteen\" with comfort food from America. The atmosphere is casual and relaxing. Great selection of craft beers. The menu is most eclectic with selections that include AZ Gumbo, Beer Can Chicken, and Chicken and Waffles. While the food is interesting some of the mixtures seemed forced."}
{"text":"I took my wife and sister-in-law to proof for brunch on the recent Sunday afternoon. It was an incredibly wonderful experience. Food was great, staff was great, the entire environment could not of been better.  I had the breakfast buffet and it could not of been a better breakfast buffet. A wide variety of choices, all delectable. My wife and sister-in-law have the Waldorf sandwich with fish and chips. Both fabulous.  My sole issue was the breakfast buffet closed at 11:30 AM. Frankly, I've never been to a restaurant where a big breakfast buffet closed at 11:30 AM and I know this caused me, and others challenges . I would strongly recommend management modify their policies and keep the buffet open to a more reasonable 2 PM.  everything was terrific. Cannot wait to go back. Until they keep the breakfast buffet open later, I'll make it a point to get there earlier."}
{"text":"We LOVE Proof! Their breakfast buffet is amazing with so many options! We visit everytime we are in the area! It caters to couples and families with little ones. The wait staff is polite, quick, friendly, and very attentive to your needs. The views and grounds are gorgeous, and the heat lamps outdoors allow for you to enjoy it year round."}
{"text":"Went last night with party of four. Some dishes were really good, others average. They try to change some tastes with different flavorings. We had two dishes in which this really backfired. \"French toast cheesecake\" and \"salted caramel\" ice cream on the apple pie.   I wouldn't really care about either of these except that it was very pricey. We're local so this won't be one of our \"go to\" places"}
{"text":"Big thumbs up. Really really enjoyed this restaurant. The service was every bit as good as the food.  And if you are big on atmosphere- has that too. The view is awesome. A little out of the way but worth the trip. Tip: try the wings. These are not your average chicken wings. I will return next time I'm in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  Sit outside, the view is amazing.  The food is delicious, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Going there again next week."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is great.  The rustic decor and the friendly staff are wonderful.  I was here for a special event and really enjoyed the beef short ribs dish.  It was a savory melt in my mouth yummy experience.  They also have great craft beers and wine on tap.  If you are up in this area make sure to check out Proof!"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch with a friend. Beautiful view of the Four Seasons grounds and surrounding desert. I had a Cobb Salad and it was excellent. I thought the $25 price was steep but expected it here. Lovely spot- sit outside and take in the view!"}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner at Proof and would definitely recommend it. This was ALMOST a four start review because it took a good 10 minutes to get service, but they were super apologetic about that, and the service was excellent from there on. The decor is kind of a western industrial chic which we liked, and there's a pretty good range of selection on the menu. There's also a good emphasis on local beers, which was a cool way to experience several small brewers without the road trip. Recommendations would be the pretzel knots (a religious experience) and the mash (so fluffy and light!). They have a shuffleboard that replaces the buffet at night, so a cheeky round of that is a nice way to top off a meal! The views of Pinnacle Peak are a high highlight as well--super romantic to watch the sun set from the portico."}
{"text":"Proof is a family friendly restaurant on the Four Seasons property... We didn't know what to expect when we walked in and dined here on a recent Friday night, but we liked it immediately.    From the rustic decor, comfortable seating and super friendly staff, what's not to like?!  Add to that an awesome live musician, delicious comfort food, a solid wine list, and we had a dinner to remember.  We started with an order of pretzel knots for the table .  The kids enjoyed mac & cheese and chicken tenders.  My husband and I shared a salad with fresh locally sourced ingredients and a burger + roasted veggies.  (We also ate plenty of the kids' french fries).  My MIL had rib bites... We found the prices to be moderate for the Four Seasons but a bit pricey in general.  Nothing too crazy though.  We had a bit of sugar for dessert in the form of their candy bar and decided that the next visit, we'd definitely go for the ice-cream.    Turned out that next visit was the next night... we went without the kids because they were watching a movie with their grandma.  We dined with another couple, our friends Angela and Rick P, and this time the food wasn't as awesome, but still good.  We had the masa cauliflower and wings as starters and then the Garbage Can Chicken entree, an Ahi Poke, Chicken sandwich, and rib bites.  The appetizers and Chicken Sandwich were the winners on night two... And perfectly timed as we finished our meal, the kids walked in and we all had ice-cream together... vanilla bean, mint chocolate chip, and a coconut sorbet... all delish!  Looking forward to returning in the future when we find ourselves in this neck of the woods!"}
{"text":"What a cool place. Very laid back. Great food, amazing staff. I travel weekly and I have to say this is the best hotel bar I have been to."}
{"text":"Love the food, the ambiance, the whole experience.  It was a bit chilly and we were not the patio..wish it could have been heated better, but that is OK.  Everything we had was delicious and the service was great, too.  Love the whole area here and the hotel...good place to bring kids, too as well.  We have been here often and love to take guests here that are visiting from out of town."}
{"text":"Favorite breakfast in AZ. Jar o parfait and torched grapefruit with a michelada. And don't miss out on their homemade jams.... Don't you dare call it jelly!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast at Proof today. Our server Grace was very helpful and attentive. Our coffee was never empty. Thanks Grace!! My husband order the Pork Green Chili Benedict and I ordered the Blue Corn Pancakes. Both of these dishes were fabulous. We already know what we are going to try on our next visit. I hope Grace will be working. We will definitely ask for her! Grace also gave us a Punch The Pig Card. Nice to go to a restaurant that gives something back. The atmosphere is very cool. I love the floor lamps between the tables. There were other staff member that stopped by to ask how everything was and the man that brought our food out was very nice as well. Great place! Great food! Great service!"}
{"text":"Recently discovered this place when we dropped in for lunch.  It's tucked away in the middle of the Four Seasons Resort and has indoor/outdoor seating options.  In the bar area, there's a full size shuffleboard game....I haven't seen one of those in years.  Since the weather was awesome, we decided to sit outside.  Once we settled into our seats, we ordered:  Pretzel Knots, $5 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/proof-scottsdale?select=tEOMXcR_1x4capEjfg95GQ#tEOMXcR_1x4capEjfg95GQ  Spinach Artichoke Dip, $12 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/proof-scottsdale?select=cHgbvJk7pe385t5t3tmQeg#cHgbvJk7pe385t5t3tmQeg  Potato Bacon Chowder http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/proof-scottsdale?select=k2VePOrtCCwCYr7nhoIWuA#k2VePOrtCCwCYr7nhoIWuA  Rueben, $19 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/proof-scottsdale?select=0nhrBqQLKZFsJybz5vDfUw#0nhrBqQLKZFsJybz5vDfUw http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/proof-scottsdale?select=6VHXCBHgODNkyqgAlACGWw#6VHXCBHgODNkyqgAlACGWw  The Pretzel Knots and Spinach Artichoke Dip arrived first.  The Pretzel Knots are amazing!  They came out warm and fresh and have a nice Queso Dip to compliment it.    The Spinach Artichoke Dip was bland...disappointing.  The hard, cruton-like sticks that came with the Dip were very salty...perhaps that's why it tasted so bland to me?  The Potato Bacon Chowder was outstanding.....rich and creamy, it hit the spot.  For the grand finale, the Rueben came out....and boy was it good!  My colleague ordered the same thing, except he got Onion Rings and I got Fries as a side dish.  The Onion Rings are thick and juicy....and sweet, very good.  The Fries were very good too.  Service here was outstanding....what you'd expect for a 5 Diamond resort.  Return Factor - 91%"}
{"text":"3 stars  because the food was pretty good.  Could have been 4-5 stars, but had to knock them for the prices .... way over priced!  Too bad, since it's in the neighborhood, we would love to be regulars but won't be back.  We were there for lunch.  Salads and sandwiches were $16-$19.  $16 gets you a brat or a veggie sandwich.  Lobster roll ... $29.  I have had lobster rolls all over the country and have never paid $29 for one.  Then there's the $4.75 for sodas .... ridiculous.  By the time all was said and done, it ended up to be about $30/person for lunch.  As I said the food was really good, but not good enough to warrant those prices.  The place was practically empty too, so it will be interesting to see if  they make it."}
{"text":"Had my engagement celebration dinner here so this restaurant will always have a special place in my heart. From the drinks to the pretzel knots you cannot go wrong. Beautiful views and wonderful service. Recommend going at sunset - the views are unreal."}
{"text":"An awesome kid friendly atmosphere, amazingly friendly and considerate staff and delicious food to boot make this place a wonderful edition to this beautiful resort!  My husband, one year old, and I are vacationing here for my birthday and last night we had a scrumptious birthday dinner with a special dish prepared by Chef Jesse for my vegan husband which was divine!  If you want a relaxing, upscale atmosphere with accommodating staff and great food definitely come here!"}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is fantastic and the setting is unbelievable. The coffee was bad but we are not here for coffee. The drinks are well made. The hummus is fantastic and the wings might be the best I have had. I really like the way Proof gives you a place to get out of the sun and get a bite to eat. The bar is exactly the way I like it, high enough and good foot rests."}
{"text":"It's kind of hidden behind the hotel. You have to park and walk to it. But it's a pretty and quite walk(when it's not busy). When we walked in we were helped right away and sat down. We came during happy hour and Server was great and helped us right away. We ordered 3 for $5 pretzel bites and they were amazing probably the best pretzels me and my husband have ever had, so definitely order the 5 for $7 (; we both ordered the proof burger which we had ordered medium well but it came out more on the medium side. I got the onion rings and he got the fries so we could try both and the onion rings were way to salty but the fries were great! I didn't like my burger but that's my bad I don't like bbq sauce. The hubby said his was good though! Our totally was close to 70 with tip included for 2 burgers with sides, two drinks, and pretzel bites."}
{"text":"I have been chef for 20 years and I only write reviews if a place is really good or really bad. This was both. Decor and waitstaff were good, but I can not get past the food poisoning we all got. It was the only meal we all shared upon arriving in Arizona on different flights, times, and airlines. We all had dinner together and the next day were were all extremely ill from top to bottom. Called the restaurant and was given the run around... as if I don't work in the industry and know how food poisoning occurs. We all had the same symptoms, sick at the same time, and were layed up for an entire day of my vacation. I would expect more from a four seasons...no compensation made and a memorable experience."}
{"text":"Very well done restaurant in an appropriate, non-corny Western theme.   They have a very attractive breakfast/brunch menu selection. I, personally, had a fried egg and Turkey Sausage (which was amaze-balls). Try the freshly-squeezed OJ Mimosa - I promise it won't disappoint!  Service couldn't had been any better - staff was quick and courteous!  Only draw-back was the cloudy weather yesterday which compromised the spectacular view from patio.  Great place to take out-of-town guests."}
{"text":"If you are looking for brunch, lunch or happy hour with good tastes and a view, go to Proof.  This place overlooks Pinnacle Peak, plays great music and has an amazing indoor/outdoor ambiance.  Order the Bloody Mary and Green Chile Pork Benedict."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for drinks, the view and vibe. He food was not good! The only item that we order and enjoyed was the cheese and meat plate. The chicken and waffles was a joke, looked like it was made 2 days ago and reheated for us. The waffle was not even as good as a frozen waffle you get at the market. The blueberry salad was horrible and the steak that accompanied it was not delicious. We then ordered ice cream, which according to the waiter is handmade. Well actually it tasted just like Dreyers ice cream from the market.   This restaurant is a joke and I am surprised that the Four Seasons management maintains a restaurant like this on the property.   Come here for drinks and the view but don't expect great dinning."}
{"text":"Proof is an excellent restaurant  for both breakfast and dinner - the portions are very generous. Everything tastes very fresh at breakfast, and dinner was presented beautifully. Dinner was also delicious."}
{"text":"My family and I ate at Proof last weekend. The atmosphere was fun and casual. We sat outside and the weather was just beautiful.  The pretzel knots were delicious and the cheese board had some unique cheeses that were yummy. My favorite thing was dessert. We tried different options. My mom and I had the pink lemonade sorbet float that was amazing. The sorbet was a great combo of sweet and tart. My dad had the Rhubarb pie with ice cream and it was wonderful...I may or may not have snuck a bite or two.  Overall, the atmosphere was great and the food was just as great. I have food allergies and the server was very knowledgable of the menu and really helped me pick items that work with my allergies."}
{"text":"Best brunch I have had in the U.S. and the margaritas are the perfect compliment to an amazing view."}
{"text":"First off, I cannot even express our gratitude for such a wonderful experience celebrating our grandfather's 84th birthday tonight. He really enjoyed the restaurant and dining (and drinking) under the stars in such a beautiful setting. Everything at this restaurant is well thought out and unique. From the smokey (potent!) Clint Eastwood cocktail to the sweet and savory Chicken and Waffles with a kick, we were blown away. More so, the service was the best the valley has to offer. Tony took excellent care of us, to  the point where we felt like he was celebrating with us. I wish he could've joined us! Thank you so very much for treating us like we were part of the Proof family. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nobody is sadder than I am to say \"so-so\", or as Yelp so eloquently puts it, Meh. Had an early lunch there; few vegetarian items to choose from on the cheesy menu (everything has some cutesy name). The veggie sandwich came on unbilled, unmentioned rye bread. Yuck! My husband's meat burger came with bacon, which was mentioned on the menu, but the surprise was that the bacon was breaded (think fried green tomatoes, or tempura). Weird. However, the chips that came with the sandwich were great. Yes, the best part of my Four Seasons lunch was the chips. Also, my chair was stained with red wine (and again, I was there at lunch, so this must have happened last night), yuck, and the server was all about the hard upsell.  Wouldn't go back, and am pleased that at least I got to use a gift card instead of our own hard earned cash."}
{"text":"Came for dinner, was very disappointing.  Food and service were mediocre at best.  Prices for cocktails are outrageous -- $20 for a martini!  I can understand why resort guests would eat there for the convenience, but this local will never dine there again!"}
{"text":"While searching for a wedding venue, my fiance and I had lunch and later returned to grab drinks under the stars.  The views capture the best of Arizona -- bright stars, shadows of cacti, serenity, and the red/orange/yellow sky.    I thoroughly enjoyed the GRILLED PEAR & ARUGULA SALAD.  \"A quercia prosciutto crisps\" .... amazing addition to the salad."}
{"text":"Bacon Carmel Spiced Popcorn and Chicken & Waffles (split it)...simply awesome!  And John behind the bar knows his stuff and feel free to let him choose your flavors."}
{"text":"This review was actually a 3.5. On the Four Seasons website, the page presents this bar as a hybrid restaurant/sports bar when it's actually a sports bar made to look like a restaurant. The service was a bit slow and the duck fries, while novel sounding, were not good, the cheese having congealed too quickly to be edible. This may have been due to the slow service or just using the wrong type of cheese for the dish.   The Maine lobster roll was pretty good and tasted spectacular but would have been better as a wrap to stay together. The crab pasta was amazing, but overall for the price we paid, this was not a good find."}
{"text":"Hands down the best in Scottsdale, especially on Friday night when Dell Morris smokes a meat special.  BTW, the Leemann Sazerac is fabulous!"}
{"text":"Fantastic breakfast and not overpriced! The English breakfast with poached egg on English muffin with crab hollandaise sauce is incredible! The breakfast buffet (all u want) is great with bacon that is moist, smoky , and flavorful. Omelets to order with the freshest vegetables. Don't pass this place up if you are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Located in Four Seasons Scottsdale Resort; solid quality food and delicious flavors. The Ahi Poke was fresh and tasty; the house smoke NY steak was tender and full of flavor.  If you're watching your waistline, order the 3 piece (not 5 piece) pretzel bites and don't feel guilty- just enjoy them and the cheese sauce served with the bites. Service was great...friendly, helpful and customer focused.  Portions of all dishes ordered were generous so consider splitting entrees if you order appetizers too.  I dedicate 4 of 5 stars, reserving 5 star rating for ultra exceptional experiences; Proof was delicious and enjoyable for a casual resort restaurant."}
{"text":"Even though I was not staying here ( I wanted to though!), I had an incredible experience at Proof. -so well decorated that I just had to take it all in! -comfy decor, like being in one of my friend's homes, but they don't have a bar that big. -Fantastic menu. Wanted the huevos rancheros but decided I wanted to still fit in my size 6 pants, so ordered the salmon with mini bagels, vine ripened tomatoes and herbed cream cheese. enough for 2 but I don't share very well, so ate it all. -incredibly attentive service.  You can't beat The Four Seasons for excellent hospitality and Proof is a place I wish was in my back yard. So many great menu items.  Look forward to returning and having breakfast/lunch/dinner and a Bloody Mary and then going to the pool and having a cold Corona!"}
{"text":"So-so...went for lunch. Expectations were high and they weren't met at all. The staff was great but the kitchen needs help as well as new creativity. I had some rib ap the was just okay and a pulled pork sandwich which was not good. It had some crazy flavors working in the pork that didn't enhance the food and took away from the pork.   My date had fish fry which was under cooked. They made good on it though and gave her my ne cook just right.   Apple pie was great!  Good seating atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food was great, the drinks were great. The staff was very friendly. One night there was a little trouble with our reservation, but after discussing it, the staff corrected the situation quickly."}
{"text":"I liked it.  The breakfast buffet is awesome and the blood mary isn't to shabby either.  If you're in the area go check it out, it has a nice selection of food, a great bar and an unbeatable ambiance courtesy of the surrounding mesas and beautiful desert landscaping.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because I think it's a bit over priced.  I understand it's at the Four Seasons but even so, the food itself is pricey."}
{"text":"I don't know how we hadn't already discovered this place - we live down the street.  The decor is terrific and perfectly reflects the sophisticated twist on a diner menu.  We started with the chicken wings - excellent. No celery - a small detail, but it didn't detract from good wings. I had the blackened salmon and grits - it was wonderful. A nice salty rub and I'd like to believe it was reasonably healthy. My partner had the chicken and waffles signature dish. Since he never had chicken and waffles before it was difficult to compare it to anything else. Let's just say that it was interesting and tasty.  To finish, I had ice cream (yum) and he a spiked orange soda float...really excellent. We'll be back.  There were a few oddities: - We made the reservation through Open Table but received a call from the restaurant that we had to call to confirm our reservation. Odd and defeats the purpose of making a reservation online. - On two occasions (if it was once you'd ignore) the hostess came to our table and interrupted our conversation with our server. Odd, really odd. She tried a third time when we were speaking with the Manager (a very pleasant Scotsman) and he had the sense to shoo her away. - Finally, there's a game table in the middle of the restaurant. We were seated next to it. Parents sitting on the patio let their kids play un-supervised and they were fighting. So ask to be seated away from the game table just in case some unruly kids show up.  Heartily recommend."}
{"text":"It was a great place to have drinks while on vacation.My family even decided to see a dinner menu.I had the chicken and waffles and found the chicken to be not as good as the waffles... The bacon appetizer was powdered with brown sugar and was very good! My daughter and I ordered (2) double shots expresso and was shocked to see they tried to charge $18 dollars.When I called our waitress to our table and explained our dissatisfaction she and the manager determined to remove the outrageous chargeOverall a very good experience very clean and well run establishment"}
{"text":"Went here with some friends since the other restaurant on the property didn't have reservations until much later. This place is casual. The grounds are really nicely kept. There was a smell of mesquite in the air. Valet parking was fast and included with our meal, so just pull up the the front lobby area.  Started with the truffle fries. Not bad. I prefers the the ones from Yard House better. Also did the bbq pork bites. These were also \"ok\". Next up was the pretzel knots. Meh.   For the main course, I had the steak. Cooked exactly how I asked. Tender and tasty. It came with crispy wedge fries. Not sure if they were to be that crispy or not, almost to the point of being dried out.  Two other people in our party had the fish. I can't remember the name, but was told it is a cross of salmon and trout. Both said it was tasty.   The margaritas were the shining star of the evening along with our server. She made us feel like we were the only patrons on the patio, which was full.  Speaking of the patio, the sunset was absolutely amazing. It started to get a little chilly, but the heaters in the ceiling kicked in and I could take my light jacket off. The down side to that was from then on out, the heaters cast a red glow on everything so our photos turned out like a bachelor party in Amsterdam."}
{"text":"I've been to Proof twice. Once for dinner, once for breakfast.  If I had written this review after dinner it would have one star.  I had a crab and shrimp Louie  salad that had two shrimp,that in an attempt to fool the customer, had been sliced lengthwise paper thin, so it appeared much more generous and the dusting of crab couldn't have added up to more than one ounce.  The taste, so-so. The problem....the price of $25!  The restaurants decor is totally charming and we live minutes away, so a year later, we tried again, this time for breakfast.  Our experience was day and night.  The server was wonderful, the decor seemed even better and all the food was delicious.  This is the Four Seasons, so breakfast is going to run close to $25 per person, but we had a lovely experience and will definitely return.  I might even try dinner again."}
{"text":"Deliciousness with great views of pinnacle peak! I ordered the seafood lettuce wraps and prickly pear iced tea and hubby ordered the special. Service is top notch."}
{"text":"My family and I celebrated my birthday here based off the recommendation of a friend and from reading these reviews.  We all started off with the lavender Moscow Mules and that got the evening off to a great start.  Everyone seemed to love their meal.  My wife is very health conscious and had the wedge salad and Seafood Coioppino and loved it.  I had the beer can chicken and thought it was great.  The mashed potatoes were some of the best I've ever had.  I think the best meal out of the group was the chicken and waffles.  You could smell it from across the room and it was DELICIOUS!  They even included some maple bacon brittle that blew me away.  We all finished off with \"Mom's Cheesecake\" and of course it was awesome too.  The decor of the place was really cool.  Lots of antiques and it is kind of set up like a an old fashioned soda shop.  The crowd was a mix of young and old and there were even a couple of families with small kids there as well.  The place wasn't at all \"stuffy\" and the staff was always friendly and willing to help.    We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My vacation girl and I just returned from a second visit at the Four Seasons Troon North, and found that one of the restaurants had been made over and re-branded as  Proof.  As it turns out, most of the meals and drinks we had during our stay were here.  With hotels and restaurants, I think a big part of the picture is the service, and if you have time, you can read my zero star review of Cowboy Ciao (due to lack of service).  On the flip side, every single person working at Proof is terrific!  As I understand, it hasn't been that long since Proof opened, and my girl and I both thought that there's some room for improvement in some of the dishes, and the staff were open minded about some of the suggestions that we made.  All in all, we enjoyed the breakfasts, happy hour, and dinners we had here.  Special shout out to Abrielle, who's a real sweetie."}
{"text":"This place has a very current and creative but casual atmosphere, the menu is unique and surprising with an eclectic mix of Americana. Definitely order the pretzel bits as a starter!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here is such a delight! Had the yogurt parfait and the egg ranchero. Amazing! The other times I have been here for breakfast buffet were so good! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight. Good food, good view, GREAT service. Fawn made the night enjoyable. She was very accommodating, knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful. 10 stars for Fawn!!!!"}
{"text":"A restaurant located in the four seasons hotel.  Cool decor.  They have home made ice cream which was delicious.  Comes with sprinkles, whipped cream, hot fudge."}
{"text":"My boyfriend came home from a trip and said he saw this restaurant Proof in the US Air magazine that we had to go try. I was a little skeptical because I don't usually think of airplane magazines as having good recommendations, although I do want to buy a large portion of the SkyMall catalog. Anywho, after seeing the menu, I couldn't wait to go. I'm so glad he read that article!  It's at the Four Seasons in Northeast Scottsdale. Definitely park at the valet in front of the lobby. It's complimentary and puts you pretty close to the restaurant.  When we walked into the restaurant, I immediately loved the atmosphere. It's a rustic cabin meets modern style. There are comfy couches to sit around and lounge in, a long bar, and most importantly shuffleboard! I love shuffleboard!  We had reservations since it was Saturday night,  but it wasn't too busy and we probably didn't need them. We opted to sit on the patio, which has a great view of the mountains. Unfortunately, it was night and we couldn't see much, but I bet this would be a perfect place to watch the sunset.  Our waitress came over pretty quickly and explained the menu/concept. The chef was inspired by his US travels, so there is something on the menu from every state whether it's food or drink. The drink menu is over 16 pages, but I was boring and settled on a Fat Tire Imperial IPA which was delicious. My boyfriend got the draft root beer, and even though I'm not a soda fan, I definitely stole a few (several) sips.  We started with the duck fries- french fries, shredded duck, gravy, and AZ cheese curds. It was every bit as amazing and decadent as it sounds. By that point, I was already getting pretty full, but it didn't stop me from ordering the chicken & waffles. It comes with a spicy syrup and peanut brittle. The flavors all work really well together, and I almost finished the whole thing because I didn't want to stop eating it! My boyfriend got their burger which is confidently called \"We Have the Best Burger.\" I don't know if it's the best, but it was damn good. Vermont cheddar, smoked ketchup mayo, bourbon molasses onions, and deep fried bacon. DEEP FRIED!! It was gluttonous and oh so tasty.  Needless to say, we were way too full for dessert, but I definitely plan on trying some for future visits!"}
{"text":"A very nice restaurant in the Four Seasons resort.  My husband and I went to dinner here one night because we wanted to stay in.  The food is excellent here.  I had the salmon and my husband had the fish and chips.  I say the one highlight was my Watermelon Mule.  An interesting twist on an old favorite of mine!   I'd say the only issue we had was the timing of the food.  It took a little long and the waitress started out with strong customer service but after the second Mule I only saw her once.   Took away one star for that.  Other than that we had a good time at this restaurant and would eat here again."}
{"text":"Fabulous food OMG, ordered several items and loved every one of them! !! Presentation  was unique too. Great menu. We really had fun , service was great, casual setting out on patio. Family environment too. Not typical  of Four Seasons  on many levels yet Scottsdale Four Seasons creates a western charm which is quite relaxing."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast last weekend. My girlfriend got the pancakes and they were amazing. I got a breakfast sandwhich that was pretty good. My sandwich didn't warrant the price tag but you've obviously paying resort prices and we expected that. Great atmosphere and they also have Press coffee which was a plus."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant and bar! Food wasn't the best I've ever had but not terrible either. Very expensive! It could be so much more. I wanted to love it since we live close."}
{"text":"First day here in Scottsdale at the Four Seasons and this place rocks! Food is great, drinks are great, service is awesome, atmosphere is amazing. Couldn't be happier!"}
{"text":"So glad this place is close to our home. Great mix drinks, great beer choices, and best of all the Food...wow. Last night was our 1st time there, we had a great server and a wonderful time. We sat out in the patio alone and enjoyed the breeze. The Chicken and Waffles pretty much made me not say a word through dinner. It was so freakin good! Spicy butter, crunchy moist chicken, and the waffle was perfect. Great Apps... Gotta have the buffalo chili.  What an amazing place. Gotta go here!!! Might even go back today."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the new Proof Canteen.  Excellent menu, fair prices and good service.  My wife and I both enjoyed our choices for dinner. The only negative was that it was very noisy during the dinner hour."}
{"text":"Just came back for breakfast and had the Huevos Rancheros and holy cow, mind re-blown!!!  This place keeps getting better."}
{"text":"Although this is at the Four Seasons resort, it feels like a free standing restaurant inside. The Bloody Mary comes adorned with candied bacon amongst the other usuals. They just added some scrumptious short rib tacos to their weekend brunch menu which I highly recommend. This was worth the drive and you can valet your car right around the corner at the hotel for free."}
{"text":"Nothing quite like a good Mother's Day brunch - and this place is Proof (ha ha ha).  Proof is a great breakfast spot at the Four Seasons Resort in Scottsdale.  While it is somewhat distant to the valley at large, I enjoyed its charm and the fantastic service we received here.  We were seated immediately upon arrival, surprising given that we were arriving at 11am, which I thought was catastrophically late for a Mother's Day brunch layout.  They had an a la carte menu filled with various standard breakfast options.  I debated ordering a simple omelet from here, but after taking a look at the great buffet spread they had laid out, I was quickly won over and signed up for that instead.  Proof had a fantastic selection of fruits, croissants, meats, seafood, and all manner of typical breakfast accompaniments you've grown to know and love.  And of course, they also had an omelet station, which I quickly took advantage of.  The highlight was probably the S'mores waffles, which were deliciously sweet.  Our waiter was excellent, constantly checking up with us, filling water, and clearing plates (I made several trips to the buffet so this was definitely necessary).  Two (very minor) complaints.  The omelet station was completely swamped with orders.  They let us fill out paper forms with what we wanted that we could leave with the chef, who then had the omelet delivered to us later.  However, there was only one person working the counter, and he was struggling to keep up.  It probably took about a half hour to finally get my omelet, but I can't complain too much since the rest of the amazing food kept me occupied in the meanwhile.  Secondly, it's the Four Seasons Resort, and they only have valet parking - something I really dislike at any location.  However, it just comes with the territory at a place like this, and this restaurant is probably worth it in the end.  I highly recommend Proof, and I'd be interested in stopping by at a different time of the day, perhaps for Happy Hour, which was advertised as having free candied bacon!  Great food, great atmosphere, great time!"}
{"text":"This place was yummy and fun.  I liked the location and the view. The service was really odd. We waited forever for our food and some of the dishes were cold?  Not sure why they didn't bring some starters out before the rest of the food. Not sure if we paid so much why our popcorn was so small...if folks are ordering food, the popcorn could be a tad larger?  It was the BEST popcorn ever!"}
{"text":"***Update - had a last minute dinner here and the brunch really is where it's at. For dinner, the service was still stellar, but the pretzel knots were \"ok,\" the duck fat fries were more of a poutine and the food was fine. Just didn't blow me away like the brunch.   I'm not a big brunch buffet person at hotels because I always feel there's something \"off,\" but not here. Proof has such a wide variety of sweet and savory offerings - each and every item delicious and unique. We are staying at the Four Seasons and will likely eat breakfast here every morning now. Favorites from the buffet: homemade donuts and jams; mini lemon ricotta pancakes with citrus vanilla whipped cream; chorizo hash browns; & the pulled pork pies. You really can't go wrong with anything. Such an improvement from the Mexican restaurant that used to exist in that space years ago!"}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Service outstanding. Beautiful restaurant and location. Prices are far beyond what the listed $$ indicates. For one appetizer, two mains, and two deserts plus drinks we ended up paying $120 + tip. The food portions were not commensurate with the higher prices. For example, $24 for one tiny thigh, one tiny drumstick, two 2\" diameter waffles, blueberry syrup, and less than an ounce of bacon brittle is rather outrageous."}
{"text":"I see why people who are not staying at the hotel come here to eat.  The food is very tasty as are the Moscow Mules.  The cheesesteak is very tasty.  The onion rings have to much breading for me, but to hers int he party liked them.  Got a side of the BBQ blue-cheese which was pretty fantastic.  They also have a pretty stealer beer menu, mostly local, but good. Tried my wife's burger, just a standard Burger, but one the the best I have ever had.  Service was friendly and very accommodating.  Look forward to returning next time I am in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Good food with a good setting. Little spendy but it is on property at the Four Seasons.  The pretzel knots with their spicy queso are great. They usually have specials going that look pretty good. We enjoyed it more than their fancier restaurant last time. However it sounds like they changed the chef and style since we were there."}
{"text":"This is a great place for an high quality meal in a casual environment.  Service is fantastic and the food is delicious.  Recently went to the restaurant as part of a party that included a child who has a peanut allergy.  Our server Daniel did a great job making sure that everything served to the kid was nut free.  He went so far as after asking the chef the ingredients went to the individual ingredient providers website to double check their safety.  Many places just gloss over this.  Daniel really went above and beyond.  I really appreciate it."}
{"text":"Been sitting here for 20mins and still haven't met our server. LOL. If ambience is your #1 motivator look no further than PROOF Canteen. If you're actually hungry you will get better service at Chilis. Hopefully the food turns out okay. #NoConfidence  Update: Manager Kelesey took care of us. We appreciated his understanding of the situation. Also the smoked babe sandwhich is pretty fantastic."}
{"text":"A really unique and comfortable restaurant with food to match.   The decor is different and original. The service is terrific. The food is comfort food with a twist.   Breakfast was delicious from the hash browns, to the buttermilk biscuit and topped off with the blue corn ricotta pancakes.   Wonderful, different and appetizing menu choices, not your run of the mill fare.   I imagine lunch and dinner are as much fun. Worth a trip back for another meal.   Four Seasons hit the nail on the head with this one. Job well done."}
{"text":"Amazing desserts and great bar service when we went in there and it was a fun nostalgic place for us very special"}
{"text":"Been there twice. Great food but buy the wine by the bottle."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place.  I'm the east coast but have been here on vacation 3 times.  I actually think it might be my favorite casual restaurant in the U.S.   Ambience is great, especially if you want I relax for brunch (the buffet is spectacular) or to watch a game.  TVs everywhere but because of the location, doesn't have the feel of a sports bar- just a relaxing place to enjoy the views, have a drink and some good food.  Food is excellent- not a huge variety but very good.  Staff is great- young, energetic, friendly and extremely helpful.  It's an extension of the Four Seasons Hotel itself.   I would recommend Proof to everyone- especially for guests of other hotels that want something different.   It's worth the extra time and effort to get here."}
{"text":"This place seems to be schizophrenic. Looks like a rustic, relaxed bar & eatery, with an overpriced menu with fancy foods. Just doesn't fit together.  The hostess & waitstaff uniforms are more shabby hillbilly than cowboy shiek.  The staff is attentive & friendly.  The food is way overpriced & just so so. Nothing we had would we want to repeat. Hubby had hamburger. I had pork tenderloin. My servings were slight & just not visually attractive. Should have been served with a magnifying glass!  And for $27 it was way too pricey. The ketchup served with the fries was awful!  Why would they want to ruin a good French fries with a tomato chemical shit storm?? We had to request regular, which they brought to the table.  This was our 4th & last visit to this place. Just not good enough for a do over!  If we ever return it will be for the pretzel knots."}
{"text":"We ate here about 4 times while we stayed at the Four Seasons. My favorite meal of ALL time is here: the chicken and veggie grilled sandwich with a side of greens. The best sandwich of my life I tell ya! We also had some great breakfast here. Their buttermilk biscuit is out of this world. And their homemade jams."}
{"text":"Great Food good service and reasonable prices it beats eating by the pool good atmosphere some nice views of the mountains"}
{"text":"Proof is the full service restaurant at the Four Seasons, breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It has a recent west honky tonk feel to it with a great interior and nice exterior seating.  Some tables appear to be mounted on the rolling undercarriage that you would see on a mine car.  Proof has a really nice ice cream/milkshake bar for old school versions of these at Four Seasons prices.  However, they have sundaes two for one on Sundays from 3 til 5:30 p.m.  Dinner is more of a home cooking type deal or comfort food as they call it these days. Quality food with the Four Seasons price tag. We really enjoyed the breakfast buffet which is only served on weekends.  It is $28 but well worth it.  Thick sliced bacon, apple and sweet potato pancakes, good sausage, a really complete yogurt and granola and fresh fruit bar, great coffee, specialty juices.  Smoked salmon and made to order eggs and omelettes.  A good deal wihen I am already paying the big bucks."}
{"text":"Coming here for the first time, valeting the car, and walking down the dark outside corridor to find Proof reminded me of the Amangiri in Utah where all the lights are kept low at night to allow for enjoyment of the night sky.  The restaurant itself has a unique route 66 feel to it and the menu is something you are not going to find anywhere else -- at least not at the same time. All unique items for the most part but at the same time comfort food that is familiar in enough ways to make you want to try everything.  There were no disappointments sharing the Pretzel Knots, Fried Green Tomatoes, and Spinach Artichoke Dip. For the main course the Beef Short Ribs were a winner for me.  Having stayed several times right next door at The Rocks I am surprised it took me so long to find this little gem right next door."}
{"text":"What an amazing view on this patio.  You get a great view of Pinnacle Peak, cactuses, and beautiful desert life.  Service was good, food was tasty.  I had the pullled pork sandwich.  This will be a  bit pricier but you're paying for the view, which I think is worth it.  If you want to save money just come here for happy hour, dessert, or a drink."}
{"text":"I was waffling between 3 and 4. The food is absolutely delicious, and the service is exceptional. It's the prices that are just a bit hard to take. You definitely pay for the convenience of on-resort dining. My husband and I are staying at the resort and have been here twice, once for a meal and once for a snack. Happy hour for the snack was great. Our server was friendly and helpful. We got the two buck popcorn bucket, which I liked and my husband didn't. We also get pretzel knots and sundaes. The pretzel knots are soooo good. The sundaes were yummy too. For dinner later in the day, my husband got the burger and I got the salmon. The burger was especially delicious. It really is a good burger. The salmon was moist and perfectly cooked and seasoned, too. Our server was friendly and helpful. The only thing to complain about is the prices. But again, I guess you pay for the convenience, and I still really like it here. Yummy."}
{"text":"Cool spot at the Four Seasons Resort. This is their workhorse restaurant, serving breakfast / lunch / dinner. Ate here multiple times while staying on property. Depending on how busy the hotel is, this place can get crowded. Also depending on \"demographics\" of hotel guests, there can be lots of kids here. Very casual atmosphere, so kids were running around and it didn't seem to get any feathers ruffled. At dinner, the crowd and kids made for an energetic atmosphere. Food was overall very good, menu is creative and interesting."}
{"text":"Came here with our group of 11 on a Monday night for dinner and drinks. Love the decor! Food was great too. I recommend the fried green tomatoes, the pistachio crusted cod, and the chocolate pretzel caramel cake for dessert."}
{"text":"We always enjoyed going to Proof but our last 2 visits, one was breakfast and this time for dinner we were disappointed. The view is all that it really has going for it. The service is friendly but still not up to Four Seasons standards. The menu has changed and now has fewer options. My fried chicken and waffles were tasty as was my husband's meatloaf. Both were very filling. The cauliflower side was delicious. But our biggest \"Yuck\" moment was when my husband got 1/2 down on his beer to realize stuck to the inside of his glass was a long blonde hair. When the manager approached he told him, showed him the hair and they did bring him a new beer but made as if it was no big deal. Doubt we will go back."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale! Great for breakfast or dinner. The service, desert views, outdoor patio & tabletop shuffleboard are the bomb.   For breakfast, you can choose the tempting buffet with omelet station or order from the menu. Kids can get pancakes with M&Ms, blueberries or chocolate chips. The huevos rancheros are spicy and fab. Steak & eggs is delicious too. My daughter's waffle was light and fluffy - so good!   For dinner, start with their buttery pretzel bites with cheese sauce. Their steak was one of the best I've ever eaten - cooked to perfection with morels and cippolini mushrooms. My son declared the kids' hamburger the best of his life and ordered it two nights in a row.  Save room for dessert, for sure! The chocolate hazelnut pie with brûlée banana was salty & sweet & chocolatey perfection. My son flipped for his Cereal Shake. All ice creams are rich & made from scratch, as are their chocolate, caramel and strawberry sauces."}
{"text":"Handcrafted bevs with house infused delights and fresh muddled fruits to take your crafted cocktail to another level. Food is irresistibly delicious."}
{"text":"This has to be hands down my husband Larry and my favorite restaurant. The staff is phenomenal we usually have Brandon or Fausto. They both provide EXCELLENT customer service. We love the food, cleanliness and atmosphere. What a hidden gem tucked away near Pinnacle Peak mountain. Oooohhh, don't forget dessert!!!!! The desserts are amazing."}
{"text":"Incredible in every way possible.  Love the location, setting and service!"}
{"text":"Pros:  The staff was very friendly, knowledgeable, and improved the experience. The food and drinks were also very good. The menus are made of license plates and there are other items that give the \"speak easy\" type feeling.   Cons:  Biggest con is the price point. While I expected it to be higher than regular, I wasn't expecting $120 bill for two people. The Moscow mule alone is $14 dollars I found it difficult to find. While I expected to have to do some searching since its in a resort, I didn't expect it to be hiding behind the resort.    TLDR: Really good, be prepared to pay a lot. Located behind the lobby."}
{"text":"I couldn't love this place more! Fun and romantic - a combination not easy to find and the fried green tomatoes were incredible. Add a few craft cocktails and the view of Pinnacle Peak? Sign me up."}
