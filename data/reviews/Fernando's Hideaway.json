{"text":"Walked by this place many times and was at their old location before but first time eating at their new location.
Only wanted to order a couple of drinks and snack.
The basic nacho with cheese and salsa sauce was all we ordered.... And it was such a disappointment.  There was no lettuce, tomato , just cheese and a squirt of salsa sauce and baked. 
Had to pay extra for sour cream... Their old place never charged for it and had more than just cheese and salsa.
Will try it again to see if the other entrees are better.. But not getting a good feeling at my first visit."}
{"text":"This place was mediocre. It had pleasant atmosphere and good service but the food was pretty tasteless. 

We got the traditional nachos, veggie quesadilla, chicken ques, steak ques, and fish tacos. 
Each came with beans,sour cream and rice. Portions were not great and feels like u get half of the value of what u pay for."}
{"text":"First impression : Very uncomfortable wooden benches to sit on. 

Food:  Horrible plain tomato sauce on my burrito, which was also very thin.  I was charged for a small cup of guacamole and the menu stated it came with my meal!!   I did love the side salad that had jalapenos in it.   Was expecting better for the high prices they charge."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed. I don't know where these bad reviews are coming from... Everything tastes great! One of our fave places. Large portions and have never felt sick afterwards."}
{"text":"Place lured me in with some nice decor/atmosphere (made it feel like an authentic mexican joint, which there are VERY few of in Toronto, if any). The place was a ghost town, I was literally the only one there (and it was lunch time in a busy area of Toronto). The service was attentive and fast (hard not to be with me being the only one there).
Food quality was okay, not great/good by any means. Somewhat bland. 
Overall, would not come back here again."}
{"text":"We wanted to have Mexican food and came across this place - \"Toronto's oldest Mexican\" . So decided to give it a try. The place was not very crowded, for a weekend. The atmosphere and décor were really good. Their service was also very friendly.
We ordered veg Chimichangas and Veggie Chili quesadillas. Both these were served with rice, beans, guacamole,sour cream and a salad. The sides lacked flavour, but the quesadilla and chimi were okay (liked the chimi better).The menu was a bit pricey. Overall, the place was good but their food was just okay."}
{"text":"Met some friends here around 6pm or so on Dec 23-15, thinking it would be the same as Hernando's Hideaway down on Wellington (with just the first letter being changed to distinguish between the two).  So I just checked their website and it says they are formerly known as Hernando's on Yonge.  Hmm.  All I can say is that this Fernando's with an F, is not near as good as the Hernando's on Wellington, however their names/businesses are set up.  The atmosphere is cute with bright colors, simple Mexican decor, a fair number of tables.  The menu looks the same, but the visit here on Xmas Eve Eve was not good.  We did feel bad for the female server, who was stuck alone in the restaurant and really trying to do all she could.  But management needed to be there to help, if someone else called off sick.  It took forever to get our food and most of our plates were dried out from sitting under a heat lamp it seemed.  They had already run out of white wine, and then after two of us had a glass of red each, they ran out of that.  The small Super Nachos (onion, tomatoes, green peppers, and mushrooms 8.99) weren't bad.  My Enchilada del Norte (13.99 with veggie chilli) was okay.  Two friends split a platter which I don't see online that included Mexican spring rolls and a few other items, which they said was decent.  One in our party tried the 'Big as your Head' Burrito (16.99  A large flour tortilla loaded with rice and beans with your choice of chicken Vera Cruz, burrito beef, or choice of chili. Topped with Monterey Jack and Fernando's Red Sauce.) which was again 'okay' and edible, but not memorable.  Overall, there was nothing to make me want to come back here."}
{"text":"Awful. $13 for TWO TAQUITOS. But they're cut in half so it almost feels like 4. Not really though. Salsa is like grocery store generic brand chunky salsa. Gross. Flautas are too puffy and mushy. Churros tasted like burnt oil. Covered in sugar. \"Spring rolls\" are a cruel mushy joke. Stupid honey chipotle sauce is a gross watery mess. Enchiladas looked like someone scraped a pan of last week's chilaquiles on top of a pile of rice n beans and called it a day. Chimichanga was a crime against chimis. So covered in topping mess that it became a soggy burrito without a single spot of crispy shell anywhere. Also had a bland, boring Taco Bell flavour. Everything had a lingering burnt oil flavour that is my lasting impression of this shamefully overpriced 'meal'. Most of this is sadly going in the garbage. Don't waste your money at this trap!

Anyone wants real taquitos that will give you mouthgasms, come talk to me. I'll give you $13 worth of taquitos, and you'll be stoked."}
{"text":"This restaurant recently moved  from the downstairs location at 545 Yonge Street, below Wellesley, to its current street level location at 591 Yonge, in the space previously occupied by SHUSHI Hanna, concurrent with its name change to \"Fernando's\"..  

I had not been in this place in a few years, so decided to take chance on it  and check out the new location.      The restaurant's decor is kitchy and charming, in a run-down sort of way.  What happened next was a series of unfortunate events.   I began by ordering a Margarita that made my mouth pucker because it was so tart  and improperly mixed.  I asked the indifferent waitress to fix it, however her disingenuous reply was simply that the Margaritas are prepared  in bulk every day, -  a \"non reply, reply\".....

The meal I ordered later emerged with the plate at around 350 degrees F ... When I ended up burning myself on the plate and decided to complain, the owner./manager/chef/bouncer invited himself to sit down across from me at my table and proceed give me a gratuitous lecture about how he \"has been doing it this way for 20 years, etc, etc.\"   I was astounded. 

Everything about this place screams that they are \"phoning it in\" : from the dried out rice they served me,  the meat that was dried out and tough ( like it came out of a can) to the poor quality of the hurried paint job on the walls.. 

Stay away, stay FAR FAR away !"}
{"text":"First timer. Dine-in for two. 8PM. Was actually intended to go to the burrito place (take a fat wild guess) just across the street but this place had esthetic appeal with colourful and whimsical decor with the menu conveniently largely posted outside. So we tried it out with one of us haven't eaten all day but both VERY hungry. The place got us at \"Mexican Challenge\"; the burrito platter as big as your head. Drool.
Inside had seldom customers and music played a mix of mexican and 1980-1990 ballad songs. Very quaint with playful, classic, vibrant colourful mexican decor. Digged the framed old-timey Western wanted posters and beer-bottled salt and pepper shakers. Booths were spacious and clean. So far I'm impressed and excited for the atmosphere to manifest in food.
Menu was extensive and screamed flavor and a variety of alcoholic drinks but we were set on for the head-sized burrito. Right away you're served with an adorable basket of tortilla chips and salsa. Went south immediately as the chips reminded me of those no-name-brand-chips that sat in the back of your cupboard for a year or more. Salsa looked home-made with inconsistent chunks of onion and green pepper but tasted blande so after a few munches it turnes into a sad attempt of a salsa.
Then lo' and behold the \"Mexican Challenge\" wasn't much of a challenge at all, kinda. Looked delicious but after bites of it you find yourself dragging your taste buds to a one-dimensional mexican cliché. Very cheesy, which was great, and plenty of sauce to eat through easily. But lacked freshness in spices and texture. The side salad was squares of lettuce and shredded carrots with a vinaigrette; looked out of place but gave the crunch and freshness the platter needed. I actually poured the sad salsa unto the burrito to give depth. Or something. The challenge was starting to feel how a kid can't/doesn't want to finish leftover meatloaf for dinner towards the end of the meal. Immense hunger carried me through well enough to finish.
Overall this place got me in esthetics. Friendly front of the house look and service but not sure about the back of the house. I would go back because it has potential. But I'll have to either go back by myself or another friend because like 50% of fellow Yelpers they were thoroughly disappointed and have no plans to go back."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying this place advertises itself as the oldest Mexican restaurant in Toronto. There are plaques and awards for best Mexican in Toronto covering the walls of the breezeway. The service was excellent and it was very cozy inside. I really appreciate the late hours, too, as a long night out is great topped off with a fresh taco. 

Canada, I love you. But what happened? Maybe I'm spoiled after spending so many years in Southern California and Texas. Hell even Colorado had very respectable Mountain Mex, rich in mole and verde. 

This is the worst Mexican food I've ever had, short of a discount frozen enchilada tv dinner I ate once in a moment of hunger-driven weakness. I ordered a standard bean burrito with chili sauce. Simple. The sides were flavorless. No taste at all in the rice. The beans had chunks of dried up whole pinto bean and appeared to only have been fried once. Also flavorless. The salsa tasted like canned chopped tomatoes with a sprinkle of chili powder. The tortilla chips were stale.

The burrito itself was baked, for some unknown reason. The tortilla, fresh from its plastic packaging, was resultingly dry on top and mushy on the bottom. It was covered in barbecue sauce masquerading as mole. Inside were overcooked vegetables. One was green bell pepper, the other was so mushy I'm not certain if it was a carrot or a sweet potato, neither of which have any business in a bean burrito. There were a couple small blobs of mozzarella snuck in to random areas of the plate pretending to be cotija. They were like the leftover bolts from an IKEA furniture assembly. Unsure of where to put them, they hid them in random places hoping we wouldn't notice they weren't supposed to be there. We noticed. In spite of the distractingly bland flavor and the hunt for even a single jalapeño, we noticed. 

Messing up Mexican is like messing up toast. It's so basic as to be impossible to ruin. But they somehow managed it Olympically. I'd be upset if I wasn't so impressed."}
{"text":"Seriously don't waste your money here! Food is just not worth the price! Super flavourless food :(! Like where is the flavour it's a Mexican restaurant!

1/5 - food
3/5 - atmosphere
2/5 - presentation"}
{"text":"Service quick and friendly. Establishment is funky and clean.  We enjoyed nachos and some chicken chimi's  great hot sauces a Habanero and a jalapeno to make our meals pop!  We will come back!."}
{"text":"They messed up my order, then when the right food came, it was so bland I had to cover the food in both of the hot sauces they provided. Only thing they have going for them is the friendly waitress."}
{"text":"The.worst.\"Mexican\".food....ever.
There are some bad ones in Toronto but this one deserves some type of award.
No hard feelings...but shame on us for living in Toronto and ending up going there.
Go to the burrito place across the street, it's probably more authentic.
The food was uninspired tourist style. The whole plate was baked under some type of grill which basically melted everything on it.
We had tacos and enchiladas ... Mistake. 
Keep walking."}
{"text":"We are from Texas, and this food is some of the worst we've ever had!!! The waiter/cook/host, would rather watch TV than refill our drinks! The cheese sauce was sweet....ugh!!!! There is a reason why this is called Fernando's \"Hideaway.\" It needs to be completely hid on the Bermudas Triangle!!! Beware....you have been warned!!!"}
{"text":"Ive never been so disappointed with a Mexican food in my life. Not even real Mexican food, its really crapy texan!"}
{"text":"It's a hideaway for a reason...the food was just ok.  I got the salad and my friend got the fajitas.  This place had by far the least herb, spices or flavour that you expect from mexican food.  Como en Casa next door is MUCH better.  I would probably not return.  It was also overpriced.

Food: 1/5, no flavour and just romain lettuce with stale chip bowl.

Service: 2/5, just ok

Ambience: 3/5, nice place but knowing how we were the only customers at 6:30pm, that should have been a sign.

Price: 1/5, really overpriced. That salad with drink was well over $20..."}
{"text":"I don't know if was the time or the day, but the food was actually pretty good! I had the veggie combo and I need to say I had nothing to complain about it. To drink I ordered an amazing sangria. The staff was very kind and friendly too. I loved the decoration and the colorful environment."}
{"text":"Food was good, drinks did not come fast enough.  Our table of 9 had nothing to drink once our long awaited diner finally arrived.  Margaritas were great but order double if service is slow.  Basically this place has a lot of potential however there was 1 waitress for a Saturday night and 1 kitchen staff.  It took forever to get anything.  All of our bills were wrong, some people asked for correction and others did not bothered.  Only go there if you have plenty of time on your hands and lots of patience!!"}
{"text":"I had seen this place for years before finally trying it. When I finally did I found the food to be pretty average. Nothing wrong with anything per se but certainly not an exceptional experience in any way. I had the enchiladas and they were okay."}
{"text":"We've been going here for years, my husband for many more than I have.  The quality had been gradually going down.  

We went in about a week ago, after vowing not to go back because our daughter wanted to go.  Worst food experience ever.  Nachos were stale, soggy and gross.  Food was no where near up to par.  We left over half on our plates

Server didn't even seem concerned.

Sad to see such a great place go down the drain so much."}
{"text":"My bf and I have been wanting to check this place out. One, because we love Mexican food and two, it claims to be the oldest Tex Mex restaurant in Toronto. So why not? 

Upon entering, we waited for about 2 minutes to be seated although there was only 2 tables and the server saw us but didn't acknowledge us immediately. Strike 1. 

Once seated, we were given the menu and time to decide what to order. When we decided what to get, I asked what's upside down volcano (a drink on the menu) and the server told me she's not sure and she'll have to check and get back to me. Strike 2. How can she not know the drinks on the menu because ultimately she's the server/bar tender? I ordered a cup of hot tea instead. Moving on. 

I ordered Combo 1 which came with 4 cheese quesadilla, 2 flautas and 2 taquitos (with the choice of chicken or beef). Served with sides of sour cream, chipotle sauce and guacamole. The cheese quesadilla was delicious (prolly because I was hungry). Then I moved on to the flautas and taquitos. Ugh. They fried them with old oil and every bite I took I could taste the bitterness. Strike 3. The chipotle sauce was okay but the guacamole was flavourless.

My bf ordered Taco with Enchilada. It came with a beef taco and a choice between a cheese and chicken enchilada. His review? Everything was bland. And the order was wrong. He got cheese enchilada but it came one each instead. Strike 4. And he liked the cheese enchilada better than the chicken. He kept saying how bland everything was, including the taco. He sounded like a broken machine for 5 minutes. 

Don't worry my math isn't wrong. Here I'll add one more star back because of the service. The server redeemed herself throughout our dining experience. She was very accommodating. And the food here was horrible but not great. Hence only two stars from us."}
{"text":"I always walk by this place, and finally decided to stop in. I've seen the ads - this is Toronto's oldest Mexican restaurant, my expectations were high!

Good:
- Large portions (I took half of my burrito home!)
- Friendly service and cozy atmosphere
- The food was okay - definitely missing flavour, but it came out sizzling hot

Bad:
- Their famous margaritas - I do not recommend. It's pure sugar. Unbearably sweet, ugh.

We wanted to get dessert but were too stuffed. Overall, okay. I don't think be back as there are cheaper burrito places around the area."}
{"text":"Not sure why the low stars on this place; thought it was great! 

They serve complimentary nacho chips and a salsa. I had ordered the Clyde burrito and was so surprised on the size of my plate! Came with the burrito itself along with refried beans, rice and a salad. It was very tasty and I could barely finish it. I really wish I had room for that and for their churros which I heard are to die for. 

My partner and I went on a Friday night and they had a special of $3 tequilas. Also their pitchers are $12! For this price you can get Canadian, Coors or Pabst. Great deal for sure. They only had one waitress running the place; there were only 2 other tables during our time there. She was very friendly and did her best to accommodate all of us. 

Prices are very reasonable for the portions and quality; definitely will come back!!"}
{"text":"Friendly server. That's the only good thing I can say.  No A/C - it's sweltering in the restaurant.  Asked for a recommendation from server - nachos or fajitas - she highly recommended the fajitas.  Ordered double fajitas steak/shrimp for $36 - terrible.  Just terrible.  Tiny overcooked shrimp - enough for maybe 2 small fajitas.  Tough, overcooked meat.  Veggies were burnt.  The toppings brought to the table included soggy chopped tomatoes instead of pico de gallo.  Asked for the pico and server seemed confused.  Eventually brought out a side of not-very-good pico (no cilantro at all).  Forgot side of jalepenos we'd ordered but brought them out when reminded.  Virgin margarita for my son was almost as expensive as my regular margarita (mine was good but only half glass had salt rim).  Terrible dinner was $75 including 15% tip for one alcoholic and one non-alcoholic drink & fajitas for 2.  Never going back."}
{"text":"Ive walked by this place plenty of times and always wanted to try it. Me and my friend were downtown and decided to give it a try. 

Walked in and everyone who worked there was super friendly! The atmosphere was nice and seemed cozy and authentic. I sat down and checked in on yelp the place only had one other review and it was bad, i normally just look past it when a place has 1 bad review and think it was someone who just had 1 shitty meal (it happens at the best of places) 

Ordered the flouritos with chicken as an appetizer they were amazing! The chicken was sort of like pulled pork texture and the tortilla shell was perfectly crispy. The sauce it comes with tasted fresh.

As my main i order the beef taco and burrito combo and I asked for extra rice instead of the beans since im not a fan of beans.

The rice was typical spanish style rice and tasty.  The taco was amazing the beef was extremely favourable.   The chicken in the burrito was as well. The portion was HUGE! I couldnt finish everything. 

Overall, I highly recommend this place the food is cheap and great! I'll return for sure! Dont let the bad review stop you!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on spur of the moment. We got the yummy platter of quesadillas, flautas and tacos. Great lunch and friendly service. Definitely stop by again when in the area."}
{"text":"The waitress working was really nice. 

The food and prices however were horrible. I paid $50 for 1 adult and 2 kids who are off the kids menu and I drank water. 

We had their famous nachos which were chips smothered in cheese, that's it. Nothing else on them. The kids had soft tacos which were way too big for the kids menu and too hard for them to eat. I had the plate of two tacos which were ok. The beef in them was ground beef and the tacos reminded me of what you would get at Taco Bell. 

I've been feeling ill since I've left the place and the kids complained their meal tasted gross.

It's great to have a variety of places on the Danforth but the owner and kitchen staff should be embarrassed about their product here. 

I'd pass on this place."}
{"text":"There are very few Mexican restaurants in Toronto that get it right.   Fernando's Hideway provides what I would call a fair facsimile of Mexican food, but it just doesn't quite capture the flavor.  When I recently dined there alone, I was served some tortilla chips in what looked like a thimble.   The refried beans looked somewhat lumpy, as if they were not fully cooked.  It's not the worst place for Mexican food--but it is eclipsed by even Taco Bell.   And Taco Bell is a lot less expensive!"}
{"text":"This place is about everything you'd want if you're going out for Mexican food. Myron was very welcoming and accommodating. The restaurant is incredibly clean and extremely funky. And the food? Oh wow! Listen, I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food, probably from lack of exposure, but this was unbelievable. The Margherita was the best I'd ever had. I particularly enjoyed that the food had NO grease and wasn't over-salted. Delicious! The servings were extremely generous. I can't come up with one bad thing to say about this place, and I'm extremely picky. Get there. Get there now."}
