{"text":"As good as it gets as long as you aren't looking for fancy. The place is clean. The service is VERY fast. The staff is very accommodating. Prices are  extraordinarily reasonable. This is good old home cooking, fast and cheap with friendly surroundings. We love it and eat there often."}
{"text":"The service was fast, attentive, & courteous. The pancakes were to die for. If you want a good, filling bfast/brunch at an affordable price...highly recommend trying this place out. From the outside it's not super impressive to look at but inside is clean. And the service....I don't think my soda NEVER hit the 1/2 way mark. I was so stuffed on good food...u think I had to be rolled all the way home."}
{"text":"Food is good and pretty fast. There were children running lose, but not causing too much damage. Service is good and friendly as well. A little out of the way for us, but would definitely return if doing something in the area."}
{"text":"Nice little hole in the wall. Extremely quick service and the food was pretty good. You have to know what you're getting with this restaurant - quick service and cheap food. Stick with the staples: anything fried, pancakes, bologna sandwich, etc. anything beyond that you're taking a risk."}
