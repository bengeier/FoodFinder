{"text":"Been in twice now. A definite 'hole-in-the-wall' restaurant but in the way that gives you a sense of authenticity, as if this place and its food would be equally at home on the streets of Guyana. Plastic tablecloths, a few women loitering around the kitchen, loud Caribbean DJ music pumping, a garish and deserted bar on one side, various flags, shirts & pictures scattered on the walls...

The food backs this vibe up: cheap, hearty, delicious. Get the roti. $8 gets you enough for a very hungry person or two people looking for a light meal. I'm no Guyanese food expert but this is delicious and hits all the right spots."}
{"text":"It's not the BEST Trini food I've had but its certainly not the worst and its pretty tasty AND cheap. Last time I was there for $20 I walked out with:

4 doubles
1 boneless chicken roti dinner
1 extra large oxtail dinner
1 bag of poulories and sauce

The ladies who run the place remind you of your Caribbean aunts who don't take shit but serve good food.

Check it out, its so random to find a Caribbean place on the Danforth let alone one worth eating at."}
{"text":"Come-on people! Its deal time! and I am not talking about used car salesman, I've got a house in Florida, you can't imagine what this piece of art is going to be worth in ten years deal.... nooooooo, I mean a D E A L. 

Lets talk about that word for a second. People throw the word \"deal\" around like its going out of style, but not moi. \"Deal\" is a very special word that can only be used within the following parameters: 

1. The product has to be something you actually want or need. 70% off Kurdish Yack Tongue does not a deal make. 
2. Its not a deal if I have to get in a long snaking line  with tweens, teens or eens of any kind, fill our forms or wait more than 15 seconds to receive it. 

Got that? ok, moving right along. If you want a deal head to Sunshine Cafe any weekday for lunch. Leave your friends and lovers and co-workers and baggage and just go, they will weigh you down and once the lunch comes you won't be talking to them anyway. So here it is:

You will drive up, exit the car left, enter the dive joint and order \"the special\". There is a large menu board, but just ignore it... I know its hard, all the pretty pictures and all but just say the words \"I'll have the special\" and get ready for a deal. What do you get?

-a quarter of a jerk chicken, 
-rice and peas
-home brew. could be mango or other fruit

The jerk is ....say whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? then you have another bite to see if it was a mistake.... say whaaaaaaatt??? you will keep repeating this with every bite. 

The rice and peas are excellent and the home brew is... well... words just fall short.  

And the deal? Its 2.99! Two Ninety Nine. That's right folks... you read correctly.  If you want... get two... its still a deal! Get three and take one home.... go crazy. ..... just go

I'm done with this review. 

go


GO!"}
