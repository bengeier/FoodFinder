{"text":"Ordered the buttermilk chicken fingers with slaw and cornbread.  Slaw and cornbread were pretty good though the chicken fingers were ridiculously over salted."}
{"text":"Ordered a whole chicken with four sides and two gravy at dinner time (6pm Sat). Very disappointed to have waited 30 mins for the order. The mac n' cheese, and fries salty, the slaw was what they can scrape up from the bottom of the bowl.  You figure enough chicken was made for the dinner rush.  Guess nobody learned anything from David Adjey on Foodtv, \"you do not have customers waiting!\". I expressed the disappointment to the cashier, and her reply was \"there is nothing I can do about it\" and David Adjey endorsed this?  This was my second time ordering takeout from the restaurant and will be the last."}
{"text":"Update on the mac and cheese - had it again today and it was much better than last time! It was very cheesy and the breadcrumb topping had a nice garlicky flavour.

Hint: I went to get the mac and cheese as an afternoon snack. I don't know if they need to keep making fresh batches so he was wanting to give it away but the portion was HUGE and it came to only $3.15 after tax."}
{"text":"What a great fast food joint.. great to hear that they are expanding! They hosted last night's elite event and it was pretty awesome.

My favourite was the buttermilk fried chicken, jalapeno cheddar cornbread and the crunch top mac n' cheese. I also preferred the California slaw over the other veggies.

Truly a different fast food restaurant know that the menu is made fresh, down to the sauces.

Would definitely go again for more :)"}
{"text":"First and foremost, this place is WAY too overpriced. I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich and could not believe how dry and bland it was. The bread-to-chicken ratio (yes, that is a thing, at least for me) was way off; there was way too much bread in comparison to the meat that was inside. Also, I ordered delivery and did not receive any of the 3 side dressings I ordered. Do yourself a favor, and pass on this chickery. Hands down."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and the service and food is consistently good, which is very important! I always get the chickery fingers with potato salad and they portions are decent for the price you pay, fair. The flavour in both are exceptional considering chicken fingers are known to have a boring rapport, when done poorly, which is often with many restaurants but today, we are focusing on how the Chickery is not one of those places!

Also, big shout out to Samantha who I happen to see every time I'm there and she's very friendly and efficient!"}
{"text":"Great food! The chicken, both the roast and the fingers are fresh and juicy. One caveat, kinda pricey for what is essentially fast food."}
{"text":"I was walking by the place and saw that it was own by a famous chef..and decided to try. So my friend ordered the chicken breast with bbq sauce and i got the pulled chicken burger with a side of macaroni and cheese. Yark! Soo gross! First the portion is small and the food is not good at all! Kfc is sooo much better 10 time. Their macaroni is not even good, the taste ... tasted  like youre eating flour that is not cooked. The bbq sauce taste juste like the one you buy at a grocery store. Their price is way over price. For both meals.. and a bottle of water cost us 26$. Worst money spended for a meal! Please dont do not go  there!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Just opened and this place is well needed.   

Loved the fries and the chicken sandwhich.  Killer flavor and soon to be a landmark."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place out for lunch one weekend and it was really delicious. We ordered the jalapeno cornbread and chino salad to share and also the sampler combo which came with 3 different types of chicken: finger, feather and rotisserie, plus one side and dipping sauce. The rotisserie chicken was super moist and seasoned perfectly, as was the chicken feather. I wasn't 100% impressed with the chicken finger as it came out a bit too oily. However, we really enjoyed the jalapeno cornbread, the salad and mac and cheese. We would definitely go back for those sides and the rotisserie chicken again. The place was also clean and the staff very friendly. Definitely recommend a try."}
{"text":"They don't make their own sauces anymore, use to love their ranch sauce; now it's not even edible. Use to go once a week, haven't been back since they changed their sauces. Won't recommend."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular lunch venue with my colleagues. Yes, the price is above average for fast food but the quality definitely worth the price.

For now, I probably have tried 90% of their items on the menu.

Their rotisserie chickens are definitely MUCH better than KFC and super market whole chickens. They are moist and tender. Does not feel greasy at all. Great selection of sauce, my pick is usually BBQ and Plum sauce but they are also tasty without the sauce.

Their salad portion is generous. I'm a tall guy and found it filling enough for lunch.

My favorite side is their fresh made Mac-n-Cheese! Home made and topped with bread crumbs! Their potato salad is great too! They are not like those which bath in mayo... they are actually tasty with herbs in it.

For chicken fingers, you can actually taste the real chicken meat. Not like those McNuggets. 

Old style glass bottled coke are great companion to the meal.

Staff are friendly. I always chat with the manager when I'm waiting for the food.

Em... I guess the only think I'd say is they can give their pull chicken sandwich more spice. 

Otherwise, it is a great happy healthy lunch place to go in the area :-)"}
{"text":"The food is good - basically the chicken was juicy and tasty. Having said this the service was extremely slow and I thought a bit on the pricy side. Could become a great joint with some more attention to pricing the meals right and more importantly more attention to customer service."}
{"text":"Came for a late lunch and was one of two people in the restaurant at the time. The other gentleman was already halfway through his meal. Decided to order the ultimate chicken sandwich because how could you go wrong with that.  Cashier took my order, asked for a named (I was the only person ordering or even in line). Didn't take too long for the meal to be made, cashier proceeds to yell my name across the whole restaurant as I'm standing in front of her. Waste of money!!! The sandwich cost almost $15 and was three chicken fingers cut up with some lettuce and sauce. The seasoning was overkill and was used on both the fries and chicken. Overall it was an overpriced, underachieving sandwich. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place for a little while now.

Went in after a workout to get a relatively healthy dinner of rotisserie chicken and salad. Unfortunately at 7:30 they were all sold out of roasted chicken. I opted for the Chinese Chicken Salad which was unreal. Lots of chicken distributed through out, plenty of veggies and a light oil based dressing. I

I told them I was really excited to try the trademark chicken, and David Adjey made it right by instead giving me a complimentary order of 6 chicken fingers and one of each side. He personally delivered it to our table and came and shot the shit with us for a couple minutes. He also gave my brother and I 3 free coupons for a complimentary side with the purchase of a main.

Coming from a job where customer service is highly regarded, I totally dug the fact that (1) Adjey was willing to appease us with complimentary food (2) that he was at the resto slangin' chicken and hand delivering meals (3) he went over and above, chatted with me and my bro and gave us additional coupons on top of the free food.

Needless to say, I'll be going back to The Chickery. Great food and excellent customer service = a big win in my books.

Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Saw the Rooster sign for this place as I was walking down Spadina so I decided to check it out - the food was great!  I had the half chicken and two sides (fries - excellent, like McDonald's but not greasy and the corn bread which was awesome) - this came up to $20.00 so it is an average priced lunch for the area.  I say the people complaining about price just need to be more creative and figure out how you can stretch your dollar.  The service was so-so, I didn't really notice, so I guess it wasn't that bad - we chose to do take out.  The food did take about 15 minutes even if we were there at 11:30.  My co-workers have gone since and loved the food.  I had a piece of the grilled cheese-chicken sandwich and that was amazing.  I will try this again when I return."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review. I felt it was necessary. 
DONT eat here. It's absurdly expensive for what you get. I ordered the \"ultimate\" sandwich - it's $13 without a drink. The fries was served cold. The sandwich tasted fine - until I realized I just suffered food poisoning from it. To make things worse the location was dirty, and staff just didn't seem to care about the job. Stay far away, save your money, and your health."}
{"text":"My husband and I did take out. I got the 2 pc chicken fingers with shoestring fries and he got the chicken finger sandwich with mac n cheese.  I got the fingers wild (spicey) which i liked but my fries were cold (my fault since we did take out). The mac n cheese was pretty good..tasted different than regular mac n cheese.  Oh, and i got an extra finger! :) overall, good food..but i would definitely dine there next time!"}
{"text":"First time here, cashier was super friendly and provided excellent recommendations (chicken feathers, house sauce, sweet potato tots). Food was decent enough for the downtown pricepoint.

Reason for the 2 stars though is due to everything else. I waited 15 minutes watching the circus that is the open kitchen try to figure out what to do. People that ordered before me were obviously impatient waiting for their orders as well. The person that seemed to be the owner/franchisee comes into the picture and instead of trying to help the kitchen after seeing the number of waiting tickets, decides to try and setup the cordless phone. The female manager was more interested in drinking her bottle of Tropicana oj she left on the counter and to check her phone then to help make the orders."}
{"text":"Meh. Dry chicken. Smallest cornbread I've ever had. Bland mac and cheese. Definitely not a repeat."}
{"text":"Downgrading to 3 stars. The food is consistently amazing but they can't seem to get an order right. I've had takeaway twice in the past few months and neither time has it been right."}
{"text":"I bought a voucher, which, I am so glad they are there or i never would have known about this place.
The chicken was tasty. Nice spice ratio.  I like my skin a bit crispier.  For naturally raised chicken it was quite fatty and small.  Makes me wonder what they are feeding the chickens and how long they live before they are culled.  For the record, I do know a bit about naturally raised chickens.  My firend raises them.  His chickens are as big as turkeys and just a leg and thigh of a turkey of his takes two arms for a grown man to carry and won't even fit in the basket of my bike. No joke, you should see these things.  He had his animals live for 3 months and 100% of his birds pass the inspection for slaughter.

I had the fries, which were tender and crispy.  Really good, I didn't add anything and they are already salted, like Micky D's.

I had the stuffing. It was way too spicy and too dry.  There were so many herbs that it completely overpowered  the dish.  And I love stuffing so I am happy to give you some tips on good stuffi9ng.

I had the plum sauce because it was the only one without dairy or garlic. It was good and had I known the stuffing was so spicy, i wouold have saved it for that.  The chiken was perfectly good with out it.

The place was clean and I really liked the decor and how they serve the food.  No paper plates here.  And when I brought my own containers, the friendly girl at the counter was happy to make sure that they got used.

I think it would be nice if they had fried chicken pieces and not just the strips.  But I would like to try the chicken strips.

I am glad that I had the voucher though, becasue I did think the menu prices were a bit expensive, but for naturally raised meat, I think it is worth it.  Way better than Maple Sludge Farms."}
{"text":"Mediocre stale chicken with BORING sides (mac & cheese/collard greens).  They were slow (I was the only one there) and overpriced.  The worst take-out meal I've had.  The cashier was cute and friendly but should not have given me chicken that had been sitting around until it turned into sawdust. What a let down.  I should have returned and demanded my money back but threw everything away in disgust."}
{"text":"We ordered the Whole chicken, it comes with 2 sides and in addition we ordered 1 jalapeno cornbread to try.  We had to pick-up as we are outside the delivery area. It came to just over $30.00 including taxes.

We were completely underwhelmed by this meal. Very disappointed actually.

The sides menu lacks variety.  Our choices were pickled beets, garlic mash, creole potato salad and mac & cheese.  Beets I generally love but its a tough sell for the rest of the family.  So we decided on the two potato items.  I guess greens are not a big seller, but if you are trying for a southern flair there is a lot more to southern cuisine then mac and cheese and potatoes.  Corn on the cob, green beans, baked beans etc. etc are some suggestions.

The sides are tiny.  Just enough to satisfy one person, not a family of four.   I'm not sure who they are intending to sell their whole chicken 'meal' to, but its definitely not for families.  We divided up the 2 sides - one table spoon each of the garlic mashed and creole potato salad (2 adults, 2 kids).

The creole potato salad had potential but there was so much dill  that that was all I/we could taste.  I thought the pickle crunch was nice and saw mustard seeds in it- but it would have been better to taste the ingredients and not just the dill.

The garlic mash with gravy was tasty I just wish that I could have gotten more than a tablespoon.

The BBQ sauce is nothing to write home about -its a thicker Swiss Chalet sauce and not as good as St. Hubert in Quebec.
Their home sauce also basic -its chicken gravy, its ok, but KFC has better chicken gravy.

The cornbread -we dubbed it the hockey puck.  It wouldn't even absorb the gravy/sauce. It was sad and flavourless and remained unfinished despite still feeling hungry.

So we get to the chicken.  Oye.  The supposed star of the 'meal'.  I have never tasted an organic chicken so dry. Ever.  It was so-so tasting at best.  We eat a lot of rotisserie chicken- and this is not even close to worth it.

At then end of our meal we all wished we had just gone to the Loblaws to pick up their rotisserie chicken and sides, It would have been roughly the same price, jucier and the sides would have been larger and healthier.  Or maybe just Loblaws for the chicken and Lou Dawgs  for their sides.  Basically, anywhere but here.

We had high hopes but won't order from Chickery again.  The city has much better to offer than this."}
{"text":"I went back recently to see how things have been shaping up (actually I've been back a few times now) and it doesn't seem like much has changed. The food comes a little faster and they call your name out when your order is ready which is great, but the buttermilk chicken still tastes like a big mac and their pulled chicken was the soggiest sandwich I have ever had. The bun basically melted on the five minute walk from their door to my office. I was disappointed to see that they took the quesadilla off the menu but was told it was because it was a difficult thing to make quickly in larger numbers.

My star rating stands at 2 because as it says, I've had better. The saving grace for this place is their potato salad. I would be perfectly willing to buy it by the litre tub if they sold it that way."}
{"text":"I went to The Chickery today to order take-out for lunch. I was so hangry. When I got to my desk and opened the box, I noticed they got the wrong order! So I called them to let them know, and the person on the phone said that they would come drop it off. It's convenient fortunately, because my office is literally across the street from the restaurant.

So ten minutes after the call ended, someone comes in the office and then yells, \"Who's Cindy?\". It's David Adjey (the owner) and he has my chicken. He was very nice, apologized and even make a few jokes.  

The lunch that I got and the one that was ordered in error were both tasty. I also appreciate the personal touch of the owner delivering your lunch. But word to the wise, double check that your order is exactly what you ordered. Unless you want David Adjey to deliver your food to you personally."}
{"text":"I had a 1/2 chicken dinner with fries and BBQ sauce. $14 + tax.
The seasoning on the chicken skin was delicious, but my chicken was noticeably dry and chewy. I imagine it had been sitting there for a while.

The BBQ sauce was good; the fries were mediocre. The service wasn't exactly rude, but definitely not friendly.

I know they make a big deal about their food quality, but there is a lot of room for improvement. I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Since my last review, I've gone to eat at the Chickery in person once, and ordered from Uber Eats another couple of times. Each time has been MUCH better than the first - I'm now chalking up that experience to an unfortunate Uber Eats fluke. I love the seasoning they put on the chicken/fries, and your food is almost always perfectly crispy when you get it. 

Whenever I order they seem to be out of the ginger-jalapeno plum sauce, which is the main reason why I'm taking a star off. Why don't they just make more of what is clearly their best sauce??"}
{"text":"Went there twice already, pretty decent food (chicken feather is very good!) they do a great job drying up the oil, so the chicken doesn't taste oily at all. One downside is the speed... Would not come here if am in rush."}
{"text":"I signed up to Yelp just to write this review. 
I Ordered two 1/4 Chicken dinners with sides. Two of the tiniest pieces of chicken were served and cooked beyond being edible. They were rock hard on the edges. The skin of the chicken was brittle and dried out. The chicken so dry and there was such a minimal amount that it was kind of laughable. The side rice was dried out and stuck together in chunks that would break your teeth if you bit them. The side salad was supposed to be bok choy. It was just lettuce and it was wilted and dry.
This was the most disgusting meal I have EVER had served to me. Honestly, in my entire life I have never encountered a more poorly cooked and served meal. I wish I could post a picture. 
Be warned this place is a joke. Do not order from here unless you are fine with tossing your money away. You wouldn't want to eat the food as you would probably get some severe food poisoning."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery at 7pm on a Friday and came to just under $50 for whole chicken, 6 fingers, and it came with 3 sides and sauces. At 7:35 they call me saying they ran out of roast chicken, so I just asked for 2 more orders of the fingers (relunctantly, since the rotisserie was why I decided to call). At 7:50 they call me again, canceling my order. 

Confused, agitated, and danger zone starving, I made my way to the local Rabba to get some last minute meat and veg to throw in the oven before going out.

In the line-up, I get a call. It's The Chickery courier with our food. Luckly unpaid for, I put back my groceries and head to my lobby.

When I finally get back to my apartment with the food it is 8:40, the food is room temp at best, and they did not get my order right.

2 stars only because the fingers weren't bad."}
{"text":"I bought a WagJag to try the place out.

The place is really cool, and the service is friendly.
But, the chicken is dry as heck.  We ordered a whole chicken and even the dark meat was dry.  The butter gravy was okay with hints of rosemary and thyme.  The BBQ sauce reminded me of a thicker version of Diana sauce.  
We ordered four sides.  The fries were best considering that they made me fresh batch when I walked in.  The squash was delicious and sweet.  The collards were cooked very well and perfectly seasoned.  The one downer was the mac and cheese.  The pasta was dry and the sauce was not cheesy or creamy at the least.  

Overall, I would only come back for the fries.  Considering that this is a David Adjey restaurant I was expecting a lot more.  My husband and I both agree that we'd rather go to Swiss Chalet or grab a supermarket rotisserie chicken than buy another chicken from here again."}
{"text":"To be transparent, I feel like a sucker for going back here again and again. Their chicken fingers are delicious, but the place is just so inconsistent - the quantity of chicken can vary 50% from time to time. If you order \"wild\" chicken fingers (meaning hot) sometimes they're not hot whatsoever, sometimes you get a burning hot bite. I've twice had dirt in my potato salad, I guess from not properly washing the potatoes. And the side kale caesar salad I just got it so small it's embarrassing - about four bites total, barely any kale, yet enough dressing for a giant salad."}
{"text":"LIke Eric M I'm still up in the air on this place. I've only been there once for a lunch and there were definitely a lot of people behind the counter for not much food coming out. I waited about 15 minutes behind only 3 people in front of me in the line. I ordered takeout and waited another 5 minutes to pick it up. 
When I got back to the office to eat my lunch I'd found they'd given me the wrong thing. I ordered the string fries and received the sweet potato fries. Not that they weren't good - they were - but it wasn't what I ordered. I also ordered a quarter chicken (not the white meat kind for an extra $3) and it was good, but not big at all. 
Maybe because I live in the heart of little portugal and have 2 fantastic Churascuria within a block of me, I thought it was disappointing. 
But I'm not giving up. Because it's right close to my office and I think they're trying I'm going to give it another shot in a couple weeks and see whether the process and the chicken has improved."}
{"text":"Went back to The Chickery after a Yelp event. Couldn't remember what I had so ordered some of the feathers (flattened, battered chicken) and the chicken fingers (deep fried but not breaded). Really loved both - the chickens are kosher and extremely plump n' juicy (and not pumped with water like what happens at most chicken places). 

Few extra bucks, but well worth it."}
{"text":"this restaurant closes early.  That's -1 star.  

Put it this way, the chick is just ok.   It's not dry , it's not too moist.  It's a bit better than Swiss Chalet.  That's it.  3.5 star

The service is super .  Friendly star +1 star

Location is off Spadina, hard to find  -0.5 star

Seriously, it's not the best chicken i ever have had."}
{"text":"Two ladies I used to work with swear by this place.

The food is great, chicken strips are a good size, the fries are super shoestring with a good crunch but the mac and cheese is a bit blah.  The real star of the dish is the jalapeno biscuits, oh my god so good.

I have been a handful of times and that is because that is all I could afford while still making sure I pay my rent, car insurance and hydro.  This place is pricey.  The owner must be able to buy a small island at the end of each day because the prices are high but it does not deter the crowds.  Do yourself a favour and get there before noon, I have seen the line up spill out the door during the summer.

The Chickery is the type of place I would not go out of my way for, but if I am hungry and in the neighbourhood, I would pop in."}
{"text":"2 hours for delivery, and it arrived burnt and cold. Just brutally bad. Order at your own risk. For the sake of balance, the potato salad was excellent."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this particular restaurant -1 star, but because the servers were so friendly and nice I am giving it 1 star.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT GET THE PULLED CHICKEN! I tried the pulled chicken sandwich just yesterday which tasted like tuna rather than chicken. I immediately felt sick and the stomach ache is still going on today. Dry, barely any sauce with bread that taste like it's been frozen prior to being served do not get the pulled chicken. 

DO NOT GET THE MAC N CHEESE as a side, it is blend and you could barely taste any cheese. Basically just tastes like boiled macaroni with bread crumbs.

As well, although servers were very nice, one server (tall Caucasian girl) had a strong smell of alcohol and was wobbling all over the place. I might be wrong but looks like she was drunk. I do not comprehend in any level how such behavior can be permitted in a work environment. It would be disappointing to see if she would still be working there, that would just mean poor management.

I believe the drunk server/cashier was the girl furthest to the left in one of the pictures."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and wasn't overly impressed. The mac n cheese just tastes like pasta tossed in cream and the chicken finger sandwich was dry and the sauce was overbearing."}
{"text":"Price a tad high, customer service pretty good, quality of food decent to very good.

Went to the Yelp event several days ago, and got to try several of their dishes. The parmesan friend tenders ended up being the only one I liked, where-as the rest I found to be nothing special.

The staff were for the most part friendly, with the exception of one girl who was dressed in her Chickery uniform who I was walking down the street before the event started, who gave the finger to someone.

The prices are a tad high, however considering their source and healthiness (for the lack of a better word) of their food, it seemed to match what they promise, since it's locally sourced, has no antibiotics, etc. 

So in the end, m'lady and I have decided to try them again on our own, and see if there is something we'd enjoy more than what we tried, such as the jalapeño cheddar cornbread."}
{"text":"The best of chicken in every way! P.S. Do try the potato salad. I ordered chicken fingers and they were delicious. The customer service was exceptional. The staff is very very friendly. The ambiance is perfect and very clean. I would give it 25,000 out of 10."}
{"text":"Juicy buttermilk chicken fingers. Got through ritual and it was a breezes. It is better than Popeyes not sure what other people are saying"}
{"text":"The chicken fingers and buttermilk ranch sauce are really, really good. These are the best fingers you'll get in this area. The price is a little steep, so this is a place I'll go to treat myself. Make sure you check in on Yelp to get your free side! I highly recommend the Mac & Cheese. It's drizzled in croutons, and worth the trip alone. I'd give this place 5 stars if the price of a meal and drink was closer to $11, and I'd visit much more if that were the case too.

Edit: Food poisoning changes everything, doesn't it?"}
{"text":"I'm sorry I didn't like it. Way too salty for me. The Parmesean chicken fingers were thin and mostly breading. I could not finish even 2 fingers. Would never go back. Really turned my stomach for the day."}
{"text":"Hipster bull s&*t. Avoid at all costs. Went on a whim for lunch today. Got in line and decided to try one of their \"artisanal-esque\"  salads. Being in a bit of a hungover daze, it didn't really register that the price of said salad was $13 with tax. So  I proceeded to order, making just one request for no tomato - which, believe it or not, was met with a snarky, impatient response, complete with the patented hipster eye roll/dismissive head shake.  Perhaps his skinny jeans were a tad too tight? 

Whatever. I was hungry. And after being abruptly told to take a seat while they prepared my $13 masterpiece - 17 with a coke! -I anticipated a feast worthy of the price tag. Wrong. Dry chicken. Easily the worst I've had in a long time. And a salad which was apparently  \"full\" of  market vegetables. Apparently that means a few chick peas, some edamame and some diced romaine. Where is this market they're referring to? Siberia? 

Don't fall for this crap. It's right out of the Williamsburg hipster guide to hood winking people into paying more for less. Only in Brooklyn, the try hards at least make good food. This place tries hard and fails miserably."}
{"text":"If you're a chicken-lover, then you definitely need to try The Chickery! I've ordered take-out a couple times now and the chicken never ceases to amaze me! It's a great place to eat especially if you're in a binge eating type of mood (haha). They are known for their signature buttermilk Chicken Fingers and their parmesan spiked Chicken Feathers! My favourite things to order are the 4pc Chicken Fingers or 5pc Chicken Feathers. 

The 4pc Chicken Fingers are $11.95+tax and comes with choice of side and dipping sauce. Choice of sides include: Fries, Mac N' Cheese, Potato Salad, Pickled Beets, Garlic Smashed Potatoes, or Sweet Potato Tater Tots. Choice of dipping sauce are: Hot Sauce, Chickery Sauce, BBQ, Buttermilk Ranch, or Ginger Jalapeno Plum. For the Chicken Fingers, you can choose the spice level which are Mild or Wild. 

The 5pc Chicken Feathers are $11.95+tax and comes with choice of side and dipping sauce. The choices for the side and dipping sauce are the same as the Chicken Fingers.

Overall, this place serves good chicken! You can choose to sit and dine here but it's more of a take-out place. The Chickery is also in collaboration with Grabb so if you ever want to order take-out from your phone, don't hesitate to use the Grabb App!"}
{"text":"Ordered the 6 chicken fingers (comes with side and sauce), an extra side, and fountain pop which was good enough ($25 total) for 2 people. The quality of the fingers are hit or miss. Some pieces just tasted chunky and chewy while some actually tasted like chicken meat. Do not order the \"kale\" cesar salad - it comes in a little box and there was not one piece of kale... also the \"croutons\" were stale. Not to mention, any extra side order is $3.45 - so do not order the salad!  

Overall, would not come back here again."}
{"text":"I don't think I can eat at Swiss Chalet any more.

The chicken is perfect - moist and delectable. The butter gravy is good, but my favourite is the BBQ sauce - I can't get enough of it! 

Mac 'n cheese is a perfect side - not too overbearing. The potato salad is good, too. 

I wasn't \"wowed\" by the chicken fingers, maybe because I didn't really like the plum sauce (just personal taste, maybe). 

Mind you, I haven't tried their sandwiches or salads. Will report back when I do.

Definitely worth trying out."}
{"text":"5 stars for their chicken fingers. I'm only reviewing their chicken fingers as its the only thing i get there.  Usually with mac and cheese side. But back to the chicken fingers.   I can only think of one other place where I would rather get chicken fingers in Toronto. Get them wild if you like a little bit of spice."}
{"text":"Staff in the kitchen eating chicken w their hands and preparing food at the same time. That was off putting. Food was good. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Tried the Chickery twice now (once through Foodora and once in person) both have been subpar.  Though the staff if friendly the food is just below average at best.

I tried everything from the roasted chicken, chicken sanwhiches, tenders and most of the side dishes and dips.  Sad to say but if you want chicken tenders popeyes has better. Want rotisserie chicken? Swiss Chalet.  Chicken sandwiches? Anywhere else probably.  

The sauces are commercialized too sweet and too salty. No real flavour or spices coming through just a mouth full of sodium.  I must note that the mustard sauce is probably best if you have to pick one.

The sides are the redeeming factor here, the Mac and Cheese is not cheesy but good. Potato salad was actually really good.  Others less notable but OK.

I wouldn't recommend going here I just can't justify the prices.  For the same amount of money you can have a more elevated to-go meal or find chicken that is much juicier.  They don't offer anything special that would warrant a revisit."}
{"text":"I ended up at this place with some coworkers while on a work trip.  As a vegetarian, I'm mainly in it for the sides, and these didn't disappoint.  The mac and cheese is some of the best I've had - super creamy and just a little smoky, with nice crunchy bread crumbs.  I also really enjoyed the kale salad and the street corn, and the fries were great - especially dipped in all the different sauces (I'm pretty basic and liked the buttermilk ranch the best, but the honey mustard and Thai chili were great too).  

The staff was really friendly, and the food came out surprisingly quickly.  Unlike a lot of the fast food places in this area, everything is really high quality - particularly the chicken, as my omnivorous friends informed me.  It's like sit-down restaurant food, but fast!  Which is a must for a work lunch. I'll definitely be back here for the mac and to try a different salad.  Oh and also to try the carrot cake, because it looks amazing...saving room is the tough part!"}
{"text":"the food was underwhelming. Ordered the Latino Salad, very little chicken in the salad and it was soaked with dressing. So soaked that all the lettuce was limp and heavy from the amount of dressing on it. The service was rude right from the beginning. Cashier and from the guy who brought us our food.
I will take a pass on this place."}
{"text":"Went here twice in a row so I'm awarding them my first review of the year. Yesterday I had the 3 piece dark meat and today had the quarter chicken white meat. The chicken is organic, natural, blah-blah-blah but the seasoning is ever tasty and the meat quite moist. The white meat was a tad dryer than I would have liked though. Yesterday had the collard greens side and today the yummy stuffing that seems to be made of even more chicken. (!!)

The sides are in competition with each other so each month they drop off the two least popular sides and introduce new ones. I like that idea of keeping things interesting."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had been telling me to go to this place for a while now because he said their chicken was so good so I decided to give it a go when I was in the area. It was amazing. I got the Chicken Feathers with Fries and Barbecue dip and my friend got the Chicken Fingers with Ranch dip and Mashed Potatoes. Chicken was perfect, wasn't huge fan of the ranch dip but the barbecue dip was dope. Great experience. I'll be back"}
{"text":"If you can get past paying $14+ for lunch, then this place is A-OK. I Really enjoy the buttermilk chicken fingers. I also really love the sandwiches. What I don't enjoy is that they got rid of the sweet potato fries. they were delish and now I'm left with a craving that I cannot satisfy. 

The location is right off of Spadina behind the overly priced What a Bagel. It's kind of tucked away but I like that about this restaurant... It's unpretentious and with simple yet fun decor (the lights are made with wire baskets) I really feel comfortable here. What I don't like, is the lack of energy from the staff. With an owner like David Adjey you'd expect a bit more pep in the people working there."}
{"text":"Food four stars. The price made it lose a star.

Chicken tenders were tender and flavorful. Loved the gravy. I'd go back to try the 1/4 chicken but seriously it's a tad too pricey for fried chicken"}
{"text":"I had the rotisserie chicken white meat only.  It was good, but nothing stood out to be amazing, memorable, or different.  The Chickery Sauce was good, and the smashed potatoes I thought were ok, again nothing memorable.  The staff were pleasant and friendly."}
{"text":"I ate the chicken fingers with the house made chickery sauce and it was amazing. I definitely tasted sage and thyme in the sauce. All in all it was fun to look at and fun to eat. I only wish I could have eaten all of it. Very good, will come back again."}
{"text":"This place is not the same as the Spadina location, I've ordered food via just eat from the spadina location many times and every time the delivery service they use is fast and friendly. This location uses a really terrible service called  \"Joey Co\". Sunday August 7th i ordered at 6:07pm, the food didn;t arrive until :725pm, and when it did, the box it was in was soaking wet, the food inside was a disaster, wet,wet,wet, soggy cold fries, their chicken fingers batter had literally been steamed off and was wet. it was literally a mess. I contacted just eat, and the store told them they would re-deliver another order in 40mins, so i waited, and waited, and waited, at 9:10pm i re-contacted just eat and they were clueless and they said the store was too, in fact they had closed at 9pm, i ended up waiting 3+hrs just to get a full refund, and no dinner... So the store never resent the order to me, and they waited until i called back before they gave me a refund, really incredibly poor service, 3+ hrs wasted, left starving at 9:30 and forced to go out and get whatever i could find on a Sunday night. This has to be one of the worst if not the worst experience i've ever had with the chickery and just eat. My mistake was ordering from the closer  location what was literally less than a km away, my thinking was the delivery would be faster and the food hot and fresh, BIG mistake, next time i'll order from the Spadina store. And i'd suggest you do the same. stay far away from this mess of a a store."}
{"text":"Well i have to say this was surprisingly very good! i ordered the buttermilk chicken fingers (, wild) wild style is spicy, and it was spicy in a adorable kind of way, not really hot, just extra seasoning.  Regardless the chicken fingers were out standing!! great batter, crunchy but light, not greasy in any way. The fingers were huge too, seriously, no kidding, the size of a baby's arm lol... huuuge... i ordered 6 which comes with your choice of side, but just in case the serving was small, i thought I'd try the mac and cheese too. Well first off, the 6 finger meal was huge, i could barely finish it. the shoestring fries were excellent as well. The only disappointment was the mac and cheese, i found it very lacking in flavour, the crushed croutons on top were a decent idea, but seemed a little stale to me. it really needs to be finished in the oven and wasn't. The other issue was the lack of cheese sauce, it was pretty dry. I tasted more pasta than cheese, it really needed to be much creamier and cheesier. Overall, i was very happy i ordered from this place, the food was surprisingly delicious, well except for the above mentioned mac and cheese, it wasn't awful,, but for a Chef David Adjey creation, it was not good, very substandard. My guess is That dish is likely not being executed to Chef Adjey's standards, i suppose this is what happens when you have other people making your food. Some people just don't have as much pride in what they produce nearly as much as the chef. 

Will i order again?? hell yes... (and I did) the chicken and fries were crazy good. will i order the mac and cheese again? hell no.... I want to try the roasted chicken, but man the buttermilk fingers keep calling me... maybe one day I will... for now it's all about the fingers, or maybe we should rename them to arms! :)

EDIT: I had the Mac and cheese again, just to be sure what i originally got wasn't a bad batch, sadly it was EXACTLY the same as the first time, again a very pasty texture, seriously lacking any cheese sauce, the strongest flavours were from the pasta itself and the fairly bad crushed croutons on top. REALLY disappointing, especially since this is from a renown chef.. Chef Adjey, i hope you're reading this.. your crew obviously isn't executing your recipe properly.. i hope thats why at least :) outside of the mac and cheese this place is pretty great. just stay away from the very bland, very uninspired mac and cheese."}
{"text":"This place is great at what they do- chicken. This event here was great.. I really like how the owner took the time to sit down with us and talk about his restaurant and himself. The space is pretty small so when it's busy it would be quote cozy but it's a nice intimate space. They have great deals and you definitely get more than your money's worth!"}
{"text":"I had a Team Buy deal for The Chickery. $8 for the quarter chicken with 2 sides.  (regular price is $15)

I came at 5 pm and ordered takeout. The restaurant was really quiet and I had my to- go box within minutes of ordering. 

The chickery serves naturally raised, hormone free chicken, which is why it is a bit pricier  than other chicken places.  To me it is worth it to spend the extra money on quality ingredients. 

This chicken was far tastier than swiss chalet. The skin was crispy and well seasoned. The meat tender. 

The sides:
Slaw- OMG so tasty! 
Collard greens - these were good too, but not stand out amazing. 

I didn't love the gravy. They had a plum dipping sauce that sounded really tasty though, and I think i'll try it when I return."}
{"text":"Definitely a step up from KFC. I had the 6-piece buttermilk chicken finger set, which I ordered alongside crunch top mac and cheese. I also ordered sweet potato tater tots and carrot cake with hot icing. The chicken fingers were enormous compared to what I'd been expecting (\"is 6 enough\" she thought before sharing and still having enough for a full lunch the next day..) I should mention that I can't eat a whole lot but for dinner my work friends agreed that the portions were plentiful! I absolutely adored the sweet potato tater tots - so crispy and delicious! A must-try if you enjoy french fries, onion rings, etc. The carrot cake was A-ok, as was the buttermilk ranch sauce I ordered to go with the 6-piece set. The mac and cheese was alright. I think I might prefer the taste of other joints' chicken slightly better but this was a fun experience nonetheless :)"}
{"text":"We placed our order through hurrier, it took quite a long time to arrive, which probably didn't help with the quality or taste of the food, however the order was incomplete when it arrived, we did not receive items that we had ordered and paid for.  Then what we did order the chicken fingers were cold, old and WAY overfried to the point of the chicken being all dried up and almost crunchy or hard.  The Mac and Cheese is bland and flavourless.  The house chickery sauce I'm not quite sure what it is, but its not good.  Almost like a strange gravy?  Even when the order arrived for the 2nd time with our missing items, it was at least hot this time, but the food was still really not good.  The bottom line is that the food was not good, we both got upset stomachs and were sick afterwards, I would absolutely not recommend this place!  Was absolutely shocked to find out afterwards that David Adjey is involved with this place as thats certainly not the quality of food I would expect from a chef of that caliber!"}
{"text":"I went here when they first opened, I enjoyed the sweet potato tater tots and their chicken is good depending what you order. Some may be a little too dry for most. 

The pieces of meat are very large and meaty which could justify the hefty cost for deep fried chicken. 
Wishing the sides were a bit bigger cause of how delicious the tater tots are lol !

The service is fast, however their staff are immature and petty for gossiping about people while they eat in an open kitchen. No no no to that ! I really emphasize on these issues on reviews because nobody wants to try a new place and hear that while they eat!"}
{"text":"I was stranded overnight in Toronto due to flight cancellations and decided to tour around the city-- finding the Chickery made the whole unexpected layover worthwhile! 

I am huge chicken fan and get rotisserie chicken and fried chicken frequently in NYC, but The Chickery's chicken is on a totally different level. For those unaware, The Chickery makes rotisserie chicken that is subsequently fried. The result? An chicken with mouth-watering rotisserie flavor and crunchy fried goodness!

I had the chicken finger sandwhich, which was the best fried chicken sandwhich I've ever had. I also got the street corn as a side and highly recommend it.

Looking at the previous review on this place, I was skeptical of trying it-- don't be! The chef mentioned that they've recently updated their buns and have made many other food improvements, so previous yelp review should be taken with a grain of salt"}
{"text":"Work in the area and was excited for a new eatery to open up to add to the the flavours of the neighbourhood.

The space is cool but I can't go any further.  

The staff lack any type of energy or excitement.  
The attention to customer service was also lacking.  
Watching staff nibble on french fries behind the counter while waiting for my order was completely unexpected and a real turn off

We had the chicken fingers - unfortunately we had to send them back because they were pink under the flavourless batter.  The famous Chickery Slaw - was less than stellar.  Balsamic vinaigrette drizzled on shredded greens doesn't quite live up to the anticipation.  The house gravy was warm - that's all I can really say.  The gravy was lacking salt and flavour.  

It's simply over priced trendy deep fried food.

Our chicken fingers were uncooked and we were given complimentary coupons for 2 free sides.  Perhaps dealing with the fact raw chicken can make a person very ill - the customer service and attention to detail is lacking.
 
Over all - we tried it - but returning will not happen"}
{"text":"i ordered the chicken fingers with fries, the chicken sandwich, mac n cheese, garlic mash, and potato salad via hurrier. this food had no soul, was rigid like a bread stick. i was really bummed on the mac since the pics looked so good but it was just bland and disappointing. The only thing that was a nice combo was the chicken sandwich which would have been a 10/10 had they not included a big piece of bone which i bit into and lost my appetite.. probably best to leave that out next time."}
{"text":"Tried the pulled chicken special - nothing spectacular, and it did taste a bit like tuna like someone had mentioned ... guess they use very similar sauce for it. Adding cold slaw to the sandwich sounds like an innovative idea, and looks pretty good on the photo , but it really made it much messier to eat, with more things dripping on the side and enhancing the tuna-ish taste  - but the overall taste was ok, would have been better if the bread spent more time on the grill/stovetop. The \"pulled chicken special \" is special in just this: it's sandwich only, with no sides,which the \"regular \" version has (according to the photo anyway)"}
{"text":"Walked in on a Thursday night to be told they've ran out of chicken at 5:30pm. Okay fine... understandable, stuff happens. 15 min wait? No problem I'll wait. Lady walks in behind me gets told the same thing, she looks a little upset but whatever, gotta wait just like me.  What bothers me is when I come back 20 min later expecting my order to be ready and chicken is nowhere near cooked, and the lady that was behind me already got her order and left!!! Did you just give away my food? Ended up waiting 35minutes for some 'fast food chicken.' Sure was fast. 

Staff/Service: The cashier at the front seemed nice and seemed to care but the rest of the staff seemed absent minded. Whats worse, David Adjey was around and nobody even seemed to be working hard at all to push out orders.

Food: You'd think the long wait for the freshly roasted chicken would of been worth it? Not at all. Chicken was dry, underseasoned.... bland....The only thing worth getting here is the potato salad, which tasted pretty good. But a takeout chicken restaurant with bad chicken???? Gimme a break. 1.5stars/5 but I'll give it a 2 just because of the potato salad. 

Conclusion: Not coming back again for sure and would not recommend. Whole chicken + 2 sides for 24 bucks... If it had been amazing or even half good, I would pay that price, but not for this crap. Rather buy a roasted chicken at Whole Foods or Longos or something. Service was terrible too.... ridic."}
{"text":"New location. I've passed by the Spadina location a few times but never pulled the trigger. 

I am not deducting stars for their opening issues. Things like staff not knowing what to do is an expected problem for any new store. 

The problem is the actual food itself. For a place that markets \"making good food and cook them with integrity\", I'm not seeing how this brand lives up to its model. I had a pulled chicken sandwich combo. I have NEVER seen a place water down the drink machine so much. My coke zero literally tasted almost like water. The fries were over-salted (which I guess is a plus to some people?). 

The sandwich itself was terrible. First of all, the portions are stingy. The Chickery is noticeably more expensive than your average fast food place. The sandwich is noticeably smaller than what the picture suggests. You don't get your value. Secondly, the chicken is covered in some kind of mayo based sauce which I find to be a huge turn off. The mayo is so strong that it overpowers the flavor of the chicken. If you are using premium chicken, there's no way I would tell the difference because you use mayo.

I really wanted to like this place. I need a chicken place in a good location that doesn't just deep fry like KFC or popeyes."}
{"text":"Il y a toujours beaucoup de monde mais le service est en or. Les chicken fingers sont succulents. Pour tout dire même avec 6  on a comme un goût de pas assez même si on est gavé.
Pour ce qui est des plats à emporter ils respectent toujours les délais."}
{"text":"We have received delivery from the Chickery two times via Order It. Good mac n cheese, cole slaw, potato salad, and shoestring fries. The chicken with the sauce is also tasty. However, this place is overpriced. The portion sizes are akin to gourmet restaurants, the sauce for the chicken is not enough, and we are still left feeling hungry after spending $80.00 on two meals that should only rival Swiss Chalet. Going into the restaurant is not an option, because we don't live close by, but we would be curious to know if delivery means gourmet sized portions."}
{"text":"Winner Winner Chicken Dinner. 

Chicken is yummy (and organic, free range, what not), sweet potato fries are awesome, coleslaw isn't creamy (which I'm completely okay with), but lunch time is busy as hell. 

Get there early. It's quite delicious."}
{"text":"With all the buzz about new vendors for TFC (Taiwanese fried chicken) and KFC (Korean fried chicken), one really feels nostalgic towards having good ol' North American fried chicken.  Being near King and Spadina for most of my week, The Chickery is a common take out I see in my building.  Curious, I went just recently and here are my thoughts:

- If you're a Yelper, you're in luck because you get two free chicken fingers when you buy an entree and check in

- The portion sizes are ginormous! At first, the prices may seem a little high, but when you receive your meal, you're definitely going to feel bloated

- The service is impeccable. The staff members are friendly and have a very \"chill\" vibe to them (in a good way)

- The chicken burger I ordered is a popular item, but I think I will pass on this next time. The bun is softer and sweeter than most hamburger buns, so it added a unique taste. You get a lot of chicken as well, but unfortunately mine tasted bland and dry. Even the sauces, which were excessive in volume, were barely flavourful and thus did nothing for me but add extra calories into the meal.

- The chicken fingers in mild and wild flavour have a more flavourful kick to them than the sandwich.  However, be warned that the breading is thicker on these fingers, so these may not be up to your preference. 

The bottom line is that the Chickery cannot compete with large chains like Popeyes and KFC. The Chickery's chicken isn't as flavourful, moist, and juicy.  It's also more expensive in comparison, so you may want to save your lunch money for your usual trip to the food court instead."}
{"text":"Went to The Chickery one day for a late lunch, around 3pm in the afternoon.  I was planning a quick lunch but the service was very slow. I waited for 25 minutes for my order to be ready (4 chicken fingers with macaroni & cheese).  There were 5 staff and only 6-8 customers, all of them waiting for their orders.  It didn't look like the staff were busy, they were standing around chatting and it didn't look like much is going on in the semi-open kitchen.  I feel they are over-staffed but then again it took so long for one small order to be made. I don't think frying takes 20 minutes when there were only 3 people before me. If there was a catering order slowing down service, they should probably let their customer know about it. 

The chicken fingers were not bad, what made it special was the batter and coating. It was thin and crispy, very good batter. The chicken itself needs more seasoning since the batter is not heavily seasoned.  Once the gravy is gone it just tasted like a big piece of plain (albeit juicy) white meat. There was a slight burnt taste that tasted like burnt spices; it could be the spices in the coating being burnt by frying, or that their oil has burnt spices from frying lots of chicken and needs changing.

Mac and cheese could be more cheesy and seasoned. Because it was pre-filled into a small cup, all of its sauce were at the bottom so the macaroni at the top didn't taste like much. They used curly long macaroni which is quite nice and chewy. 

It is quite expensive for a small order of chicken fingers and a small side. I might try it again to see if the service thing is an anomaly, when I am not in a rush."}
{"text":"The Chickery is the Whole Foods version of KFC that saw David Adjey manning the helms of menu consulting. 

As per their website the chicken is sourced from Beretta Farms and promises to be free-range, hormone/steroid-free, no antibiotics, grain fed, and air chilled.  

The sides are constantly changing to make the best use of seasonal ingredients.  The sides will also change based on popularity (ATM I think the baked beans and the baked squash are on the chopping block).

Ironically their website states that they will \"..change your expectations of what fast food can be!\"  If changing my expectations of fast food means that I'm going from a less than 5 minute wait to a full 30 minute wait - then that phrase is sadly true!  

In their defense, they had been running a WagJag promotion and the expiry date was fast-approaching so the volume was outside their SOP.

The chicken was indeed tasty and there are a handful of sauces to choose from - I opted for the plum sauce and barbecue sauce.  Our winged friend was less oily than the usual, and tender.  

The sides were kind of bland and boring.  They need to kick it up a notch on flavour.

A whole chicken + 2 sides will ring you in at $24.  I'm perfectly happy going to the Superstore or Wal-Mart and picking up their whole roasted chickens for $7.99-$9.99.  I could probably make tastier sides myself!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept, with the Chickery by chef Adjey specializing in all things chicken fingers. Despite being deep fried, still kinda bland for my tastes though. Wish they added more sauce to the burger, maybe one of their dipping sauces. Added ketchup myself."}
{"text":"Great delivery, prompt. Buttermilk Ranch was stellar, very fresh and interesting tasting, the house sauce was overwhelming and had a gross texture, and the fries did not transport well. But OMG THE ROAST CHICKEN! Seriously, so moist, tender, flavourful and just sooooo much of it. 
Mac and cheese was delightful and a must have, I will be going back many a time for some of their items, but that chicken will be the one to beat. Especially the price, $50 combo, lasted my boyfriend and I four large meals over 2.5 days. Ummm ya... thats a steal!"}
{"text":"We placed an order for delivery through JustEat. It just never need came.  The explanation from JustEat was The Chickery was  busy.
 It will take 6 days for the refund. I strongly suggest not placing orders through JustEat for delivery from this restaurant, unless you want to tie your money up for a week and go hungry."}
{"text":"First time at the Chickery today. I went on the recommendation of my co-workers.

I like the location and look of the restaurant. Everything looked clean and there were lots of people manning the kitchen. Ok, all systems go.

I ordered a \"half all white\" combo for 15.45$ (I think?). First, I received a chicken breast and a quarter dark (thigh and drumstick). Perhaps i'm not the chicken expert I thought I was, but wouldn't \"all white\" mean just that? I wasn't quite what what to expect when I asked for a \"half all white\" (it's directly on their menu) but what I received wasn't what I thought it would be.

The chicken itself isn't anything special. I was pretty excited for some delicious, juicy chicken but what I received was a nicely seasoned yet overcooked bird. You know it's over cooked when the chicken becomes stringy and chewy. I wasn't impressed. This is what they supposed to specialize in.

I asked for Coleslaw and the Ancho BBQ sauce with my combo. The coleslaw was ok, but it was small and only filled half the container. The BBQ sauce was above average and tasted homemade (or close to).

All in all a very mediocre experience. I have absolutely no desire to go back, especially after pay 16$ for lunch."}
{"text":"I was thinking about it, and it doesn't feel fair to give this place a 3-star review considering how often I've frequented the joint since my previous review.  However, it still has problems that keep me from giving it a solid 4 stars.  I mean, the food is amazing.  There are few places in the city that have a mac and cheese that is both this easily accessible AND delicious.

My big concern with the Chickery is that it doesn't seem to have any idea what it wants to be, and the overwhelming struggle to fit in is apparent every time I go in.  Since the store opened, the inconsistency in service, portion sizes, and meal choices is confusing for me as a customer.

I value consistency in a food establishment.  I admit that I'm the kind of person who will get the exact same thing every time I go to a restaurant because I know I love it and I know that I won't leave disappointed.  There was a chain restaurant that I used to go to 1-2 times a month, and I would order the exact same thing every time I went in.  When they pulled that particular item from the menu I wrote corporate (naturally), and upon finding out that it was gone for good, I literally stopped going to this restaurant.  Forget that there are other items that would no doubt be tasty - they didn't have what I wanted.  What does this have to do with The Chickery?  Plain and simple - I don't want to have to look at the menu each time to confirm you still have my favourite menu items!  And the amount of times things have changed for no apparent reason since opening makes no sense to me.  Some things could be viewed as an improvement, but some things are making me crazy!

When the store first opened there was the option to have pop in a glass bottle.  After I got used to that, the coolers disappeared and were replaced with soda fountains.  Fine - I can see the financial reasoning behind this.  But then the menu items started changing too!  There used to be a time where you could get the chicken fingers with the option of one or two sides.  Now the chicken fingers only come with one side, and the price keeps inching higher and higher for less food.

50% of the time when I order the two-piece chicken, I somehow get a third piece.  Why am I complaining?  Because I ordered the two-piece chicken and now when I only get two pieces in the future I am going to be annoyed because sometimes you give me a third piece and now I don't feel like I'm getting my money's worth!

Sometimes I'll go in and just order two sides of mac and cheese.  At this point, I am convinced they go to the back and spin a wheel to decide how they will serve it to me.  Will it come in two small separate round containers?  Will there be a heaping portion in a clear salad container?  Will there be an average sized portion in a paper container?  I HAVE NO IDEA, CHICKERY!  Some days I bring my two servings of mac and cheese back to the office and am so full for the rest of the day I can hardly get my job done.  Other days, I started praying to the cake gods that somebody in the office has a birthday so I have something else to eat.

The sides are constantly changing too.  I don't know if this is still the case, but they used to change the options based on customer reaction.  I am all for taking the advice of your customer base, but this is starting to feel gimmicky.  I want to know what your menu sign printing budget is, because it honestly feels like I am looking at a completely different board every time I walk through the door.

Even the to-go bags have no idea what they want to be.  Will I get plastic?  Will I get paper?  Will I get paper with a super fancy stamp on it?  Will there be utensils and napkins?  NO IDEA!

The long and short of it is, I love the food at this place.  I really do.  It's delicious and filling and is the very definition of comfort food.  But I wish that it would figure out what it wants to be and stick with it!  It has so much to offer, and I know it can be a really great place once it gets into a good rhythm and sticks with it for awhile!"}
{"text":"I ordered the chickery box ($14) which was a huge disappointment. First off, the amount of chicken was extremely scarce given the price. While the (1) chicken finger was quite tasty, the chicken feather had very little meat and simply taste like fried batter. The latino salad was extremely soggy and the rotisserie chicken was dry. Most importantly, they forgot the dipping sauce which is essential for a good fried chicken experience!

Overall, I wouldn't return based on the quality of the (very expensive) food."}
{"text":"Unlike the other yelpers, my cashier was very friendly. I ended up getting the chicken schnitzel sandwich special that came with one side (shoestring fries) for $12. 

The portion sizes are HUGE.  I wish I would've only eaten half the sandwich.  For a fried chicken sandwich, the chicken didn't have a lot of flavor.  The fries were good, and the sandwich well prepared, just not GREAT.  I will try it again to get their rotisserie chicken."}
{"text":"Easily the best chicken tenders I've ever had.  Usually white meat is a bit dry and dense, but theirs is juicy, succulent and even MORE tender than dark meat.  They must be soaking the chicken for days as I've never had white meat chicken that juicy and delicious with an excellent batter.  Their sides are all great too."}
{"text":"Got the Chickery on Uber Eats for dinner.  Order the 6 piece chicken strips with the creole potato salad.  To summarize the chicken strips was rubbery, I'm guessing the chicken was not fresh and the breading fell off.  I'm hoping I don't get sick, fingers crossed.  Totally unacceptable and when your business model revolves around chicken that is weak.  The creole potato salad was only thing I enjoyed.  I will not be returning as customer."}
{"text":"Nothing really knocks my socks off here.  Had the whole chicken and two sides: mac n' cheese and slaw.  

The chicken was alright, but honestly I couldn't tell the difference between a Chickery $24 bird and the $8 one from Costco/Loblaws/you name the store.  Personally, I didn't love the slaw.  My fave dish was the Mac N Cheese.  It was creamy without being too cheesy, but, again, nothing special.  

I did dig the decor and the service was great, but the food does nothing for me."}
{"text":"Let me just say that I am not a big fried chicken fan. BUT only because I have never had good fried chicken. So if I am recommending a place to try fried chicken, it would be here. 

I really enjoyed all of the chicken and chicken tenders as well as all of the sides! I am going to be coming back and taking more people with me! 

All of the chicken tasted fresh and moist, not dried out or over battered like the other places I've been to (hence why I am not a fan). But I really tasted a lot of flavour that was in the chicken. Parmesan and pepper was my favourite seasoning on the chicken tenders. So crispy and actual chicken (big ones too)! The mac and cheese & the potato salad was my favourite side. As well as my first time trying corn bread, was really good and not super spicy.

So in conclusion, I would recommend the regular chicken (white meat or dark meat you specify) OR the chicken tenders with the parmesan flavour. My favourite sides would be the mac n cheese and potato salad. =)

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I've had the sandwich, chicken finger, and quarter chicken.  None of them is good. 

The chicken are always dry and sauce isn't good at all.

Please everything they delivered are cold, cold fries really sucks!

I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"I would much rather Swiss Chalet or Nando's. I ordered a quarter chicken and fries with gravy (how could you really mess that up?). When I got my order, the chicken looked really small and tasted even worse - everything was bland, no flavor at all. I even changed the gravy (which did not taste good at all) to BBQ and that really didn't help either. I was definitely left unsatisfied/unhappy that we went there and still hungry, I would not return to this place. Go to Swiss Chalet instead!"}

Roosters, bar-style communal tables and stools and a lot of frying and roasting happening in the kitchen, are the first few things you notice when you come to chef David Adjey's Chickery in the Fashion district in Toronto. Yes, the man behind the famous Food Network Canada show, the Opener, opened his own fast-food chicken joint over two years ago on Spadina Avenue. Offering lovers of all things chicken an alternative to traditional fast food spots, chef Adjey is serving a mean chicken and even meaner sides!

What you also notice, asides from the tall man covered in tattoos, walking behind the counter checking on his food, is the quality of the meat, sauces and salads that are outputted daily for lunch and dinner time. Serving only organic chicken from Beretta Organic Farms, creating home-made sauces from scratch and serving salads with fresh ingredients, The Chickery puts a new spin to good ol' fast food.

Chicken feathers is what Chef Adjey called the great tasting strips of chicken that are lightly coated in batter and spices and served with an option of 3 of his home-made sauces: Chickery sauce, smokey ancho bbq and buttermilk ranch. The deep fried coating on the chicken is light and firm while the chicken is super moist and juicy. The secret to the crunchy and airy fried goodness, as the chef revealed to me, is letting the chicken dry for a little bit after dunking it in the batter and flour, before it goes in the fryer, therefore allowing for the batter to stick to the chicken and keep the meat flavour pocketed in, as he puts it. Brilliant!

As an alternative to it's fried version, chef Adjey is proud of it's roasted chicken dish. Hundreds of chickens are roasted daily in his restaurant and coated in a secret spice mix (over 18 spices blended together) and then put in the wonderful roasting machine, for over 2 hours. Once again, achieving a delicious, tasty and juicy piece of meat.

If all there was to The Chickery was chicken, then it wouldn't be a complete meal experience, and chef Adjey knows that. So much so, that he decided to add even more comfort to his dishes with delectable sides, one of them being the ooey-gooey mac & cheese, coated with breadcrumbs and spices, then oven-baked to perfection. Simply delicious.

Word has it, The Chickery is expanding to new locations across Toronto and the GTA, and even the Middle-East, so stay tuned for a location near you!

Buen Provecho,
Viviana."}
{"text":"I had the feathered chicken burger with fries. Was over $10 which I think is a little pricey for fast food. I was happy with my meal but wasn't wow'd. The fries were great but found the.chicken a little salty. On the up side the burger was big and filling."}
{"text":"Great lunch place, if not a little expense. My regular is the Asian salad, it's HUGE! It would do for a lunch and dinner, thats how big it is and also how I justify spending more than 10 bones on it.  When I'm feeling extra hungry or hungover I go for the chicken strip sandwich. Delish and they soak the chicken in buttermilk for what must be an eternity the chicken is that soft. The sauces could be a little tastier but they are not bad. 

The decor is pretty sweet and the staff are pretty chick-a-doodle-dandy."}
{"text":"Was at their Yelp event and managed to sample some of the food.  I liked the parmesan fried tenders much better than the fried buttermilk chicken.  I just felt the flavours for the parmesan tenders were amazing...unlike a lot of other parmesan flavoured food it was not overpowering at all..but the parmesan blended nicely with the chicken.  I did like the fact that all the chicken was nice and moist and not dried out to within an inch of their lives like sometimes fried chicken can be.  I LOVED the potato salad..it had some pickles in it that give it a delicious kick!  Turned it up a notch with the tartness of the pickles.  The jalapeno cornbread was nice..a little on the dry side for my preference, but overall nice.  I loved the fact that the salads/slaws were lightly dressed...nothing worse than having a salad DOUSED with dressing.  Ruins the integrity of the beautiful veggies!   Get clucked at The Chickery!"}
{"text":"The chicken here is always fresh, and the service is good. It's worth checking out if you're around the area. It can get a bit too salty for me, but the fact that the chicken is not oily and is super crispy makes up for it."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to like The Chickery.  I love chicken, the location is convenient and I waited with excitement for it to open.  I have been three times since it opened two weeks ago - and it is dreadful.  The counter staff has no clue what is on the (very limited) menu and struggles to ring customers through.  The kitchen staff is slow and all three times my order was missing key items that I had ordered and paid for.  The staff seems stunned when you point out a mistake and then completely perplexed that you asked for it to be corrected.  I would chalk the above up to opening jitters if the food was good, but it is so so bad. Small, dried out and tasteless rotisserie chicken. Cornbread so hard that it is inedible.  Mashed potatoes that clearly come from a box.  Mac and Cheese that is missing any hint of cheese.  Salad that was basically a bowl of romaine with nothing else.  I imagine this is what prison food is like."}
{"text":"The chicken is 5 star! It tastes juicy and not dry at all. It is not too salty or anything. The sides and the sauces are 3 stars at the most. The thing is, it is expensive for the portion you get. 2 chicken fingers for $10. And you walk out of the place smelling deep fried."}
{"text":"i was so freakin excited, went all the way from Mississauga and was insanely disappointed. 
It's way overpriced and the chicken strips were rather bland,the mac n cheese was probably thw only thing ibreally enjoyed. 
I'd have Popeye's over it any day of the week, would never go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"The sandwiches are not very good. $14 for the ultimate chicken sandwich and it only has 2 tiny pieces of chicken inside with a very minimal amount of sauce. If you want to eat mostly bun then go for it.

Also, the service is horrible, the cashiers could not care any less about their jobs or being even remotely hospitable. There are so many better options in Toronto for chicken. 

Finally, the restaurant ran out of ketchup and all sauces."}
{"text":"They don't honor the Yelp checkin deal anymore. So don't bother. One star for this waste of time.

EDIT

To the owner comment: I did try the food. Actually took a party of 5 there. I guess it would have killed you financially to honor a checkin deal for 1 extra chicken finger on a $50 bill. And yelp check in deals are usually made known when you check in. It's usually meant as a pleasant \"easter egg\". I'm unaware of an easy method for knowing ahead checkin deals. And no one I know calls ahead to see if a venue has a checkin deal and if they're honoring it."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great. It just opened up and serves nothing but chicken. Between myself and my coworkers we must have tried almost everything. My butter chicken fingers were super tasty. My mac and cheese side was a bit boring in comparison. (They have a million sides so i'll have to try something else next time.) They look to be frying everything up fresh to order. The fried chicken wasn't too oily or salty: impressive. I think this place is well worth checking out. My coworkers quarter chicken was cooked really well. He was very impressed. This place is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Wow, I came here 2 years ago looking for some finger lickin' good chicken in the area. Me and the boys were in the whip, hounding for some MEAT. As soon as I saw the sign I knew I had to eat there. My boy Tai-Rone ordered the chicken fingers and Ja-Mal ordered the 2 piece meal. I however have an optimal tastebuds and can determine how crispy and juicy a piece of chicken is by the air in my mouth so I went with the Rotisserie Fried Chicken and BBQ sauce. And I can't forget the deezed asian ni- ninja. The man hooked it up and was very professional unlike the chicken places in my hood Jane and Finch rep Robin Banks. Overall it was an exquisite experience and would bring the whole fam there ahile. PS it might be kinda expensive for some people but I got the bands and stacks."}
{"text":"Tried a 1/4 dark roasted chicken, potato salad, chickery dipping sauce (gravy with some spices as described by server, but I didnt taste the spices) and the jalapeño cornbread for a whopping $14. 

The food wasn't bad, but nothing special. The roasted chicken was ok... But nothing to rave about. It was small though. The cornbread was moist, but again nothing special. The jalapeño flavor was light so I could have had a piece of regular cornbread and not really noticed a difference. They did give me an extra serving because the one I got was smaller than the original. Thou, I looked at pics and what I got seemed to be the same size so a freebie was appreciated.

I have to say that for the price, which is on the higher end of fast food, I didn't feel full. Probably needed to spend $5 more and get the half chicken. 

My friend ordered the salad, which was nice and big. 

I think if I come again, I'll opt to try the buttermilk chicken fingers and other more unique things on the menu. My friend had a order of the buttermilk sauce which was great! 

Tip: be prepared to spend $15+ to get full if you are going for dinner and is hungry. 

Overall, I give this place a grade of B."}
{"text":"I was picking up dinner to go for my boyfriend and I on a Friday night. The staff here was friendly. The food was tasty it's a little pricey for what it is but not outrageously. They were out the chicken and cheese sandwich but that gives us a reason to come back. I had the pulled chicken sandwich it was good. I grabbed the Mac an cheese as my side was also good. My boyfriend had the 3 dark pieces of chicken with shoe string fries. He liked it but his mind wasn't blown. The corn bread was a tad under done and more fluffy than traditional corn bread should be. I would go back."}
{"text":"It has been noted that I'm more of a Yepper than a Yelper. As in all my other reviews thus far, I have endorsed  using the business in question. Well here the yep stops. I wanted to like you very much \"The Chickery\". Truly, I did. I liked the concept. Still do. But you're just such a mixed bag, and hence the 3 star rating.

Good quality ingredients? Yes. No doubt.

But you know what, for the prices, that quarter chicken is just way too darned small. Technically I suppose it's a proper serving size. According to my stomach, not so much. 

Sometimes the chicken is crispy skinned with delicious flavours. Other times, rubbery.

The sides? Anything pickled is fantastic. Beets, oh yahhh. But the Mac and Cheese? Bland. Sweet potatoes, pretty tasty I must admit.

The sauces? Okay.

Place is nicely designed. Is it always clean? No.

I've eaten here three times. So I've really given this a try. Three stars, and I don't think I'll be back on my dime. Hope they can knock off the rough edges and consistently excel."}
{"text":"The food here tastes really delicious. The fact the chicken is organic is also great.

Try the potato creole; it's really tasty - finely diced pickles in it make a wonderful flavour kick!

I would give it 5 stars for the food alone (best fried chicken in downtown I think) except for the following reason:

- Price.  Relative to other franchise options etc.  I would frequent here often if the prices weren't so hefty.  But the ingredients appear to be great quality, so part of the reasoning for higher prices seems justified (partly). Or, if prices are going to be higher, bump up the portion sizes (For the sides at least).

If you're really hungry, you probably want more than one side, but the $ keep adding up."}
{"text":"Happened to be in the neighborhood and looking for dinner, luckily my friend was ordering from this place and I was convinced to give it a try. I got the 6 chicken feathers which comes with a slide and a dipping sauce, and was stuffed when I was done with the meal. A good place for chicken fingers or variations on that theme.

The chicken feathers are pretty much like chicken fingers, but they have been pounded flat and breaded with a crumbly cheesy coating. They reminded me of smaller pieces of schnitzel, but not as paper thin. The meat was still moist and tender so I liked them. The BBQ sauce dip is good, too bad I ran out of it and had to eat the last two feathers without it...need to ration better next time or buy an extra dip. The mac and cheese side was okay, nothing too special but I appreciated the bread coating on top to keep things interesting. Will be back if craving fried chicken."}
{"text":"Come for David adjey's name, but the chicken was so dry and expensive. Not recommend."}
{"text":"With health giving food the name of the game these days there's definitely something said for meat sans hormones, steroids, antibiotics and of course, grain fed and Canadian birds. The menu is simple - chicken everything, roasted chicken, chicken fingers, chicken sandwiches and even chicken salads. Think fancy fast food.

I'm fond of the dirty and delicious buttermilk chicken and fries. I'm also known to order the Chinese Chicken salad - think Asian salad with cilantro, bok choy, cabbage, crispy noodles, peanut dressing and tons lots of chicken.

Love all the southern sides - slaw, collard greens, yams, beets! Yum!!"}
{"text":"Excellent concept. Good menu. Reliable service. Way better than other places that serve chicken."}
{"text":"Work close by. Ate here a few times. I don't know if there are new owners or new cooks but the food quality has gone down considerably since they opened. Their mac and cheese is bland and my coworker got super sick off their chicken last night. We were trying to figure out if they under cooked it or if it was their ranch \"sauce\" which was watery and gross. No thanks. Too many good places close by to eat at to go back here ever again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. The food is top notch and worth every penny. Give it a try....I go here at least once a week. Best chicken I have ever eaten."}
{"text":"Decent the foods honestly 3 star. Maybe 3.5 but the service makes it pleasant every single time!"}
{"text":"I was craving chicken fingers and decided to head over to The Chickery for the first time.  The prices were expensive for fast-food!  6 pieces of chicken fingers and a side with tax came to $16.95.  But I figured at least it's better quality chicken (i.e. free-range, no antibiotics used, etc.)

I was literally the last customer so I think they were in a hurry to close shop.  The staff was still courteous except I may have slightly annoyed the cashier because I took too long to decide which sauce I wanted.  Maybe it was just me but I had trouble finding the list of sauces on the menu!  :S

I ordered take-out and I thought for sure it would be soggy by the time I got home but 20 minutes later, it was still crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside!  However, I thought the chicken fingers lacked flavour.  I had to sprinkle some cayenne pepper on top to spice it up.

The house salad was bigger than I thought but I wasn't too impressed with the taste.  I wished I had the option of JUST ordering the chicken fingers because I really didn't want a side to begin with.  I would have liked to pay a little less without a side.

Overall though, I'm glad there's a \"gourmet\" deep fried chicken place close to my home.  The price is indeed expensive but I suppose you get what you pay for.  I'll probably come back again."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good chicken. I've tried the rotisserie and chicken feathers. Both are pretty good, especially with the house made gravy. Also really liked the herb mac and cheese. Would eat there again."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery before though \"just eat\" was pleased with the food, but now only deliver through Hurrier which apparently does not offer a cash on deliver option. I will not order under such circumstances. Find a cash on delivery system or lose business!"}
{"text":"The ultimate buttermilk chicken fingers were good. The batter was the right balance between crispy and soft - not soggy but also not like a burnt pizza crust. The mac and cheese was more disappointing because the bread crumbs were soggy and the cheese sauce had too much moisture.

It is more expensive than it should be though, and the wait was quite long. There is limited seating in this location so not so good for small groups."}
{"text":"I love the chickery. Maybe it's my love for chicken and sides that make me feel so strongly about the chickery. I love the selection of sides. They are all good. The chicken never lets me down. 

Can't forget the sauces. The chickery has some of the best dipping sauces I have ever tasted in my entire life. The ranch and plum sauce are phenomenal omg. Ordering from here is never a let down. My favourite discovery of Toronto so far!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at The Chickery.

I ordered the 2-piece Rotisserie Fried Chicken with smashed potatoes and BBQ sauce.  I received two small pieces of cold dry chicken ... definitely not \"slow-roasted\" or \"flash fried to crisp perfection\" recently nor were they \"juicy\"!  It seemed like they had been sitting around for a while.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were good, though.  At $16 (including tax), this was a huge rip-off.

When one of the staff asked me how it was, I was honest.  She said the chicken fingers are a better choice and I should get them next time.  It's pretty bad when their own staff can't recommend their rotisserie chicken!  There won't be a \"next time\" for me there."}
{"text":"It's one of the best eating places in Toronto downtown. 
Very friendly staff. And the food is amazing"}
{"text":"Very friendly servers and clean atmosphere. However, was disappointed with the chicken feather: the server advised that this was a best seller. 

I tried my best to taste the uniqueness of the chicken feather but to no avail. The house sauce was too salty. Two pieces of chicken feather for $9 bucks was not worth it. What I did enjoy was my side of macaroni and cheese. White macaroni shells with a delicious cream sauce."}
{"text":"Chickens are a bit on the small side but I suspect it's because they get them from Beretta farms or something. I'd like to think that it's because they're not roided up to get bigger.

I could eat here almost every day. Well, I already kind of do. Some of them already know my name.

Their chicken fingers are delicious, and they go well with any of the sauces that they offer (house gravy, buttermilk ranch, purple plum). My current favorite is the ranch sauce. I also like the rotisserie chicken, just not as much. It seems to taste better when I eat it with my hands, that way I can pull off all the delicious fatty bits. My hands get pretty greasy that way, but that's OK.

My favorite sides are the candied yams and mac & cheese. Delicious. The potato salad is also pretty good, but their fries aren't really anything special and the collard greens... well... they're exactly what you'd expect.

Haven't tried any of the sandwiches or salads. The salads look pretty big."}
{"text":"A while back I googled 'best chicken fingers in Toronto.' Upon doing so, I came across several reviews on YELP and BlogTO recommending several places. The Chickery was one place that stood out with several positive reviews so...I decided to give it a try and see for myself! 

My friend and I really enjoyed the buttermilk marinated chicken fingers here. They were not too greasy (almost dry on the outside) and very tender on the inside. It was also obvious that the fingers were hand breaded - unlike most places who serve pre-frozen fingers. The fingers also had a slight crisp to them and a bit of black pepper seasoning (but nothing too noticeable). They also came with a delicious side of gravy (or a great selection of other sauces. I chose gravy because it wasn't extra $$) and shoestring fries, which tasted similar to McDonalds fries, all for $12. The portions were also fairly generous (they sometimes add an extra finger or two depending on who is working). The Chickery also serves naturally raised, hormone free chicken, which is probably why it is a bit pricier than other chicken places. Overall, I would definitely come back here for the fabulous finger taste and quality ingredients.

{"text":"Worst altitude restaurant every been, just don't go and get yourself mad. Food is just plain nothing special"}
{"text":"VIBE 
Casual lunch eatery with Chicken decor. Bravo on keeping up with the theme.

I ATE 
The chicken fingers came highly recommended and they are good. It's like buttermilk fried chicken in finger format, really. I wasn't stuffed after 4 fingers and a side and at $12 that's pretty pricey. For 2 fingers and a side it's $9 (SUPER pricey for what you get). Go for 4. I had Mac n cheese as my side - way too creamy for my taste. The tangerine juice is delicious. Plum sauce was okay - I would opt for the BBQ sauce next time.

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Cluck cluck. A good once in a whole lunch time spot or chicken craving takeaway."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday for lunch close to 1PM and was greeted with no-lineup! Score!

I ordered the two piece chicken finger meal with shoestring fries on the side, honey mustard dipping sauce and added a piece of jalepeno cornbread on the side because, cornbread! My order took about 10 minutes from the time I placed the order to when I got the bag in my hand. If you can, order in advance online.

The chicken fingers were great - great breading, not too much breading but not too little, freshly fried to order, white meat inside and very tasty. Not as hot as I'd expect but not too bad either. Honey mustard dipping sauce for the WIN here!! YUM - the sauce was the star of the plate, so not like the other cloyingly sweet sauces you get at other places. Rich in flavor and not too much honey or too much mustard. The fries were good, shoestring, but I didn't feel like they were fresh at all. They weren't hot when I sat down to eat and they didn't seem super fresh. Tasty nonetheless but I could have done with them being hotter. Cornbread was okay but a bit disappointing. Didn't get that much of a jalepeno flavor off it and it wasn't good enough to finish, so I'd skip it next time.

Overall a decent meal for $14, including a drink. Service could have been faster and food could have been hotter but all in all, it was a tasty lunch. I'll try them out again and check out one of their sampler platters to see what that's all about!"}
{"text":"Very yummy as hangover food. Their fries are way too salty but the rest of the food is good. Their potato salad has bits of pickles in it which is delicious. They'd get a 5 star review from me if I didn't have sodium hangovers every time I ate it."}
{"text":"One word....Yummmy! Tried this for the first time & I was impressed. I tried the sampler box because I wanted the best of everything!! The service from beginning to end was amazing and our server took the time to explain everything without any hesitation! Would come back again!!"}
{"text":"There are always issues with deliver but this place is your best bet. We order from here ALL the time! Sometimes the food gets a bit cold on the way but the chicken strips always manage to stay crispy. I like to think the good karma I put out is rewarded in the extra chicken strips I always end up getting. I also love that they change up their sides!

If you get the pickled beets and drink the juice as I do, don't be alarmed the next day when you pee."}
{"text":"The Chickery is an interesting place to indulge in roasted chicken. The location is perfect for those who live and work in the entertainment district. It's right around the corner from Camden and Spadina. I've passed by many times and there always seems to be a lineup, which made me curious for a good while.

I'd be more inclined to give them a 3.5 star rating than a 4, except that the customer service is pretty good here. Things move fast and if you're dining in, your meal might be brought to your table in just 2-3 minutes. The menu is a bit pricey, but the food is satisfying. On my first go-round, I tried the chicken fingers as recommended and they are really tender. The texture and flavour of the coating is also nice, though it could be a bit spicier. If they offered a choice to customers to kick it up a few notches with their individual orders, that would be awesome.

Must-try items:
Chicken Fingers

There was plenty more on the menu that I'd like to try before deciding on a final verdict, but I was impressed with the overall experience. There's a lot more seating than you'd expect, and it's really clean. I'm hopeful that the next visit will be an equally impressive one."}
{"text":"Chicken was really really dry.  Gravy and mashed potatoes were uninspiring.  Only ate one piece of my half chicken and threw the second piece in the trash."}
{"text":"Way overpriced for small amount of flavourless food. Won't be returning. Ordered one of the sampler boxes for around $15.. it had less food than a KFC Tuesday special box!"}
{"text":"It has been a while since I've been to a the Chickery. I used to frequent the location on Spadina. I'm happy to see that they're expanding. I came here on a weekend morning. I had a hard time finding this place. It's located on Elm Street, between Bay and Yonge.

I decided to order one of my favorites, the pulled chicken sandwich with mac and cheese. The food came out quickly. The mac and cheese was very tasty. It had a nice spicy kick to it, was creamy, and had just the right amount of chewiness to it. The pulled chicken sandwich left a strange aftertaste on my mouth. It was probably the sauce. It had the right amount of chicken in the sandwich, but I also found a large piece of cartilage in it.

Overall not bad, but could do with some improvement. I wouldn't mind coming back to try other items."}
{"text":"The food at the chickery has grown on me. I have been here so many times that the cashiers know my name. I have tried a few different options off the menu, mainly the 1/4 chicken or the 2-piece chicken fingers. On hungrier days, I ordered the 1/2 chicken or the 4-piece chicken fingers. For sides, I usually get the fries or the mac and cheese. I've heard that the candied yams and the potato salad are good. I have also tried the chicken schnitzel, but not a huge fan. The pulled chicken sandwich is very good.

The Chickery can get very busy during the noon lunch hour. It's still very possible that they give you someone else's order, but I haven't had an issue lately."}
{"text":"such yum, much taste. went once, now has cravings for their fingers'n'fries"}
{"text":"I ordered from UberEATS and had no trouble with them

The food was far too expensive for the poor quality I received.

I ordered: 

- Ultimate Chicken Sandwich with fries

- Chicken Fingers with BBQ Dip 

- Jalapeno Cornbread.

The chicken sandwich was so bland and boring, there was hardly any sauce on it. One piece of chicken was not cooked properly and had to be thrown out.

The chicken fingers were a little better. I thought I was lucky to get 3 fingers instead of 2. Once again though, one of them was not properly cooked at all and had to be thrown out. The sauce was ok.

The Jalapeno Cornbread was so-so, nothing special.

The best thing was the fries, that is pretty disappointing.

$35 was too much to pay for bland, undercooked chicken. Not recommended - at least for delivery."}
{"text":"Been watching Foodnetwork for awhile so I'm familiar with the owner and chef David Adjey, So out of curiosity  I was dying to try this place. Made my order through Ritual food app. Got there lady recognized me from my ritual profile called out my name =). They were slightly late on my order so the lady was was nice enough to give a  half chicken dinner instead of a quarter I ordered. I have to give them a A+ for consumer service.

The chicken I have to say was on the small side, maybe they're  hormone free? I mean the bones seem smaller too. The chicken (dark meat) was not dry but it was not juicy. Its probably been rested and keeped warm for awhile. The skin was not rubbery and the seasoning seem like standard a bbq rub of paprika and cayenne, but lacking the kick, smokeyness or sweetness from what you would expect from a bbq dry rub. The chickery sauce came half filled in a already small container.  it had a nice pepper corn taste but was a tad bit thick to point felt bit starchy,creamy and heavy.I did like the shoe string fries because they are thin and matchstick like texture. Overall the Chicken didn't hit it out the park for me for that reason its a 3 star, sorry David Adjey."}
{"text":"I've had The Chickery four times now, and I consistently crave it... so I've gotta give these folks five cluckin' stars. 

Whether diner, dive, chain beast or otherwise I love chicken fingers, so naturally I am a huge fan of their scratch-made, free range, buttermilk babies. Last night I had them with their cheddar and jalapeno biscuits to go, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bite. On other occasions, I've had two sides of their mac n cheese as a full meal, and with it's breadcrumb crust and creamy sauce, it, too is the stuff that dreams are made of."}
{"text":"I wasn't in the mood for anything particularly heavy, so I ordered a Chino Salad, and that might be where I went wrong at The Chickery. It was OK, at best. Definitely not something I would go back for. The boyf ordered the chicken finger sandwich with a side of coleslaw, both of which were MUCH better than my salad, but still not spectacular. 

One thing that I liked about this place was how they handle their sides - they get rid of the worst performers every season to keep the menu fresh - Great idea!"}
