{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE. The vegetable pies are out of this world delicious. When I lived in Pittsburgh I used to have a mushroom or spinach or olive pie almost every day for lunch. I also really love the stuffed grape leaves they make. Okay, basically everything I've tried from Najat's I love. Great place for a health conscious vegetarian such as myself. It's a lighter but bolder tasting cuisine than most middle eastern foods, which I really appreciate. Anyhow, I always restock on the pies when I visit Pittsburgh.  I actually missed the pies so much this winter that I sent the owners (Henry and Najat) a note and asked if they'd be willing to ship some mushroom pies to me, and they did! They were super nice and helpful, and even included some cookie treats in the package. It's nice to have a taste of home every once in a while. Pittsburgh is lucky to have Najat's."}
{"text":"I reccomend to all. great food. and everything is home made. Opening a resturant soon, keep your eyes open. I will be there."}
{"text":"Went for their supposedly grand opening and checked the hours of operation just to be sure. Hours of operation were noon-9pm. I drove my family all the way from the south hills @ 3:30pm to support a small business only to walk to the door to a sign saying they're closed until 4:30. A man opens the door just enough to yell out that they need a break, come back at 5:00. What a joke!!!! Never going back."}
{"text":"Love the HUMMUS !!!!  I'm not too close to their restaurant, but I did find a natural food store in Mcmurray PA that carries a few of their items. Yummy !!!"}
