{"text":"Had the original waffle with two scoops of ice cream ( green tea and vanilla) with a drizzle of condensed milk, blueberry and some skittles...i dont know why i picked skittles but dont do that its way too sweet and doesn't go with the entire desert at all! Just take what i took without the skittles..pick chocolate or anything else would be fine. I waited 20 minutes before getting my order. I was watching the girl do the waffles. I dont understand what takes her so long! The lady before me only ordered a plain waffle without ice cream and i was watching the girl making 5-6 waffles one after another after 10 minutes she kept making more waffles until the guy at the cash just turned around and gave a waffle to the poor lady who was just waiting for nothing... was not very efficient in managing time.  I finally got my waffle 20 minutes later.. it was good but not amazing and i felt a little ripped off because it is expansive for 9$ for what it is... wanted to try for fun but regretted the wait. i went in with no line up so imagine when there is one... you better be prepared or plan to wait a while."}
{"text":"The best Chinese jianbing crepe I've ever tried in Montreal. The egg puff was also amazing. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went to Cabane de Danny on a Friday night around 9pm, not much of a lineup probably due to the weather, it was a raining a bit.

Order:
- Original Egg puff ice cream (Match and Black sesame)
- Chinese crepe (Combo 1) with crispy cracker

Food:
Egg puff ice cream was great! A large selection of toppings, the black sesame was packed with flavour and the egg puff were light.

Chinese crepe was good, would have liked to try the one with fried breadstick but they were sold out. The toppings were great but the crepe was a bit soggy.

Service:
Friendly staff, small place

Price: 
~15$"}
{"text":"We went there being tricked by awesome photos at MTL Blog. Place itself small and was crowded when we came showing a hype. Ice cream itself tastes like cheapest one from generic selections available at any grocery store. The only tasty part was cone itself and that's it. Definitely not worth 7-8 dollars."}
{"text":"I saw the posters on this small little place showing how amazing these ice cream filled crepe like cones and had to try one right away. My girlfriend and I shared one that had strawberry and matcha ice cream inside with m&m's, chocolate sauce and pocky's on top. Despite the fact that is was very good and tasty, it didn't blow me away as it tasted exactly the way you'd expect it to. Still very good though!"}
{"text":"After seeing this store pop up all over social media for the past few months, we thought it would be nice to stop by and check what all the hype around this dessert was about. 

Arriving around 30 minutes before closing (8:30), we immediately located the store by the crowd of people waiting in front of it. The line to order wasn't actually that long, but we waited about 15-20 minutes for our ice cream after paying. We ordered the bubble waffle with matcha and black sesame ice cream, but I think $10 (after tax) is a bit too much for just two scoops and a waffle. 

The staff looked busy, and there were many people waiting on the side for their orders. They seemed to be rushing to catch up. There was a mistake in our order; we choose m&m's as a topping but got sprinkles instead. I noticed that they stayed open quite a bit after their closing time just to make the rest of the orders, though they look a few during that time as well. 

Though I didn't dislike the taste of the bubble waffle or find anything particularly wrong with service, I probably won't go again; once for the aesthetic was enough for me."}
{"text":"Took a little time to make our order, but the wait was so well worth it. So good for after dinner dessert, walking through Chinatown. We had the regular crepe with vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here months!! I wasn't disappointed to the least. For 8$, you get what I think is one of the most delicious and crispy waffles in town, plus you get to choose about six extras, amongst fruits, cereals, nuts,  oreos, syrups, etc. It is a pretty small joint and they took about ten minutes to get my order done, but I'll definitely pass by again whenever I'm around China town. The cook was very nice and welcoming. 10/10"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. The guy was so attentive. I wanted fish balls and they didn't have any at the moment so he went to the back and got some out to cook them right away for me. While waiting, he put back the other skewers i ordered in the broth to keep them warm."}
{"text":"What a fun cute little spot! Hidden in the midst China town, I was excited to try out this new venue as recommended by Eater as one of the top spots for June 2017. 

I  immediately noticed that the menu has changed to a simpler version: 

Chinese crepes:
4 combos 1-crispy cracker with egg, coriander, lettuce , chilies, sweet sauce sprinkled with sesame seeds; 2- with breadstick (a donut like baguette they put in the middle of your crepe wrap);3-with sausage ;4-with ham. For simplicity sake-I chose combo 1 spicy (it really wasn't that spicy at all- coming from someone who has zero tolerance to spicy foods). Served hot- I loved how light the crepe was and not too heavy as a meal! Can be shared for 2! There was no extra - meats to add. Price range:6-10$

Hong Kong puff pastry ice cream:
I had to get this fun dessert! I ordered an original matcha (green tea) ice cream (2 scoops)- topped with pokey sticks, m&ms, strawberries and condensed milk syrup (recommended by the staff). Ordering was simple - check off options on a piece of paper and hand it to the server. This dish can be shared as well. Price:7-10$

Wait time: 10-15 mins (mind you I went on a Tuesday 5 pm run). There was a line up after I ordered. 

Overall, I was super happy with the food here!take out only. Authentic, filling and decent priced. A total summer refresher for 2017!"}
{"text":"For a place that sells ice cream, doesn't sell ice cream. So I wanted to get just ice cream with no egg puff, they said they don't do that, then changed their mind and said they can, but only mango and green tea. Sure fine, we'll take one scoop of each in a cup. I think they charged me ~$2 something each scoop. Green tea ice cream tasted like boxed ice cream. The mango did not even taste like mango, tasted like orange. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"What to get: Egg puff ice cream
Service: 4/5
Atmosphere: Take out, dessert
Wait: 10 mins (Friday 2PM for 2)

The Experience:
My first egg puff ice cream. I'm all about the trendy and Instagram-worthy dessert fads, and I can finally knock this one off the list.

The shop is this tiny entrance in Chinatown. If not for the beautiful picture of an egg puff ice cream, I would never have stopped by or knew that this place existed. The shop is very small and probably can hold 4 customers at any given time. Luckily ordering is quick and so is the making of the desserts. 

I chose the egg puff ice cream with matcha ice cream, sprinkles, pocky, and chocolate syrup. They have other ice cream flavors and lots of toppings, but I wanted to have as much of an original as possible. You fill out a small order slip for them, but they only have a few in English when we visited. Good ol' high school French to the rescue to help me with the limited food vocabulary I knew.

Once you get your dessert there's very few spots to sit outside of the shop. You might have to walk around to find somewhere, but there's no real seating for this place. The ice cream melts fast in that hot egg puff wrap, so get your food pics quickly! It was a great first impression of the dessert and I'm excited to try more. Thanks for the first experience!"}
{"text":"The mix of ice cream crepe was as good as I expected. I highly recommand it! 4.5/5

However, the chinese crepe was beyond dissapointing. I came from China when I was 7 years old, and grew up in Montreal, and I always wished someone made this here because it was one of my favorite dish back in China. When I heard about this place I came here as quickly as I could....
Unfortunately, I was utterly dissapointed. The sauce was blend, the flavour just wasn't there. Also, the sausage just didn't fit in there at all, it simply drifted away the taste of what a chinese crepe should taste like. Furthermore, they have the option of putting the fried stick inside a chinese crepe? What?? That's like putting a hotdog inside a burger. You just don't do that. You eat those thing seperatly. It can't be mixed. Well, that was my first experience there. I thought maybe they deserve a second chance. So I came back again and again only to be dissapointed again and again. I'm sorry about this bad review but the chinese crepe simply isn't close enough to be authentic.   0/5"}
{"text":"I got a combo 2 - the one with the fried breadstick in it since I'm vegetarian (2 out of 4 combos in their salty crepe wrap thing were vegetarian!). I'm going to mainly talk about the food because there were no eat-ins in the place. The portion was HUGE. For $6 without tax, it was way more food than I expected, so I suggest either going with a very empty stomach or to share it with a friend (they cut the crepe in half anyways)! It was, I presume, fusion between Chinese food and Western crepes? Since I've never seen crepes like these before, and I'm Malaysian Chinese lol. It wasn't really my taste, mainly because it was like all the tastes that are familiar to me in one dish. It just felt wrong. The fried breadstick was a ??, which I was used to having by itself. The sauce they spread onto the entire crepe was like the dim sum sauce. It was an interesting experience, I admit, but I personally wouldn't go back for it."}
{"text":"The taste is absolutely authentic and the size is big enough. It's a comfort to find Chinese original pancake here. The boss is generous enough to add more ingredients for me for free. Will definitely go back sometime soon."}
{"text":"Tried their Hong Kong crepes and they did not disappoint. A must try dessert. Who doesn't love waffles and ice cream???

On top of that you can add sprinkles, cereal, m&m's, various syrups, oreos, pocky's, the possibilities are numerous!

Basically, to customize you have this little sheet near the cash register with the options that they offer. You check the boxes you want with pencils that are provided. It's very straightforward and once you're done you hand it over to the cashier and she circles a number on your receipt. Don't lose it, they will call out your number when it's ready.

I went on a particularly busy and sunny day so it did take a while, but they don't forget you. The lady made eye contact with me every few minutes to let me know they were on it. Worth the wait though! 
Make sure you remember your number from your receipt, they don't call it out very loudly. Don't miss it!

The dessert itself is just such a fun treat. The reason why it's a Hong Kong waffle is because instead of hollow squares, they puff out. Creating little bubbles of dough. I got a nature (egg) flavoured one with mango ice cream...I also couldn't resist and got pocky's, chocolate syrup, and m&m's on top. A weird combo but it worked! Can't wait to go back and try different combinations."}
{"text":"A pretty new Bubble Waffle place opened up at Chinatown. I've never had one so of course I had to try it! You get freshly made bubble waffle, two scoops of ice cream, and 3 other toppings. We got green tea and black sesame ice cream, m&ms, red bean paste and pocky. They made a mistake with the topping so we got extra sprinkles :^). 
Waffle was really good, the bubbles are super cake-y and dense, outside was crispy. It's a very filling treat. With tax everything came to about $10 so the price is a bit steep. Friendly service!"}
{"text":"Love trying new things! Went there randomly (we were wondering around Chinatown looking for something quick and inexpensive). I tried a savoury Chinese crepe (combo 1 with the crispy cracker, slightly spicy). Came out to around $7 and waited around 10mins in line. The size is good but I just didn't get what I was eating and it was really messy for on the go. Don't think I would get it again. 

However, I absolutely have to go back to try their bubble waffle desserts! They look amazing."}
{"text":"Don't see anything special in the savory Chinese crepe. The taste is so-so and the texture is a bit disappointing."}
{"text":"This is a storefront with no interior or exterior seating situated in a main plaza in Chinatown. The service is hard to figure out and there are usually just hoards of people milling by the waiting area. Once you figure that out, you can place an order by filling out a form and when it's prepared you grab it from the window. Although very aesthetically pleasing, the flavor doesn't deliver. The waffle has no flavor and the toppings are scarce. The flavor of the ice cream was good but not something I would crave. The flavor is a 3 but the instagramability (let's make that a word...) is a 5/5 for sure."}
{"text":"This was ok. We'd recently had bubble waffle in Ottawa and this one was good, but not as good as previous attempts. Of course, this one was consumed *mostly* by a ten year old...so it had all sorts of candy, cookies, and syrup. Despite having black sesame ice cream (which I love) the toppings and the texture of the waffle (a bit overdone) made it less enjoyable. The child however was over the moon about such a treat so I'm sure we'll be making the trek back to China town if only for her to have \"that funny waffle thing.\""}
{"text":"Egg puff tasted great! I had the combination with matcha ice cream, black sesame ice cream, mini Oreo, marshmallows and red beans. Cashier was cute that's probably why so many girls wait in line haha ;) Price was pretty cheap too. My boyfriend had the Chinese crepe also very tasty. One place you wanna try out in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars! 

Good late night dessert in Chinatown. Egg puff folded into an ice cream cone and then topped with two scoops of ice cream of your choice. We opted for matcha and vanilla. Toppings come with the price but we only wanted Nutella drizzle.  Overall, not bad but not overly amazing or memorable."}
{"text":"I had the vanilla and taro ice cream AMAZING. The lady at the cash was very nice and explained how it works so nicely to me even thought it was kind of busy. Service was quite fast. 10/10 would recommend:)"}
{"text":"Great little spot located in Chinatown in old Montreal. Ice cream is flavourful, waffle is soft and toppings like cornflakes, condensed milk does the trick. Went here twice on my trip. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Très déçue. À mon arrivée pour le lunch vers 12:45, plus de pâte à crêpe. Il me propose autre chose, or, je suis spécifiquement venu pour une crêpe, une de leur spécialité. Bien que l'endroit soit minuscule je crois qu'ils devraient mieux prévoir, surtout que la pâte à crêpe se conserve très facilement au frigo... update à venir quand j'aurai eu la chance d'essayer."}
{"text":"As authentic as it gets! This newly opened little stall serves authentic Chinese crêpes from Northern China and egg waffles & ice-cream Hong Kong style.

I tried the Chinese Crêpe and can say that it's 100% authentic, from the ingredients to the way it's made. The basic crepe is made with a blend of white and bean flour and garnished with one egg, a fried crispy dough and spring onions and cilantro. You can upgrade your crepe by adding extra toppings at a modest price."}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed was the absence of signage outside the venue, I had to sort of guess that this was the location from the lineup, and when I looked past the crowd I saw posters of Cabane a Danny inside.

The menu was as obvious as the signage, but I like the way you order the ice cream. There were these cards that guide you step-by-step through building your egg waffle ice cream.  The customer service was great; the cashier was very pleasant, which is something I very much appreciate. I like it when people smile before you hand your money over to them.

The ice cream itself, which was advertised on MTL blog, does not really live up to the hype. It's cool, it's fun, but the combinations you can make don't really make sense to me. Maybe it's a cultural thing, but the flavors just dont seem to complement each other no matter how i try to build it mentally. The matcha and vanilla ice cream were meh, sort of mute in flavor. The highlight was the waffle, which tasted like crepes, i loved it. But for the price, I'd rather go somewhere else."}
{"text":"With all this hype, I thought i might jump on the bandwagon to have a taste of Asia. 

When i went in, I was a little startle by the huge pictures of their product. The cashier gave me the paper to choose my order. After paying, someone from behind proceed in making my dessert. 

I end up with a dessert that cost me 10 dollars. Needlessly to say, I finish it in 10 minutes. 

It takes a little bit of getting used to.. it is good. I had better desserts from Asia tho.  I will try another  product or flavor on my second visit."}
{"text":"Super petite place pour un lunch ou dessert \"on the go\". C'est un petit comptoirs que ce spécialise en crêpe chinoise et en gaufre à \"bulle\". Nous nous sommes arrêté la avant d'aller à un festival au quartier des spectacles et j'ai pris la crêpe avec du jambon, uf, herbes et autres (le combo numéro 4) et c'était délicieux. Les portions sont assez généreuse, je n'avais même pas la place pour un dessert mais si leur crêpe sucré me donner vraiment envi. Il faut s'armer de patience ils sont juste 3 derrière le comptoir mais ils sont quand même rapides et super souriant."}
{"text":"Avis aux (très) gourmands : Si vous aimez les gaufres & la crème glacée, ce dessert / en-cas va vous plaire !

L'idéal selon moi : aller manger dans l'un des restaurants du quartier chinois et partager ce dessert par la suite (la portion est très copieuse).

Notez que la crème glacée au matcha est très forte en goût, donc je ne vous la recommande pas si vous aimez le matcha, mais sans plus."}
{"text":"Tried their savoury crepe. This review only concerns the egg crepe not the waffle dessert. 
I don't like it, and my friend doesn't like it either. It's not like what we had in China. I blame the sauce in it. They didn't use the right sauces, sweet soy paste and spicy sauce , instead they use chilli oil. So strange to me. I wouldn't pay 7 dollars for that. There are other restaurants make bigger and tasty savoury crepe. Go to Mei in Guy Concordia, they have similar thing but only better. 
I had to say there are many tourist traps in Chinatown and this one's crepe may be one of them. This small operation feeds on our desire of traditional street food and fails to offer a decent quality. Even though my friend warned me about the crepe, I couldn't resist to try. Only a deep regret was left."}
{"text":"For those who know me, you know I'm not a fan of deserts as I label those as junk food. But I must say I was quite satisfied with this refreshing creativity. The waffle fuffly and just perfect for the ice cream."}
{"text":"Depuis le temps que je souhaitais essayer un(e) \"jian bing\", cette crêpe chinoise croustillante si populaire dans les rues en Chine, mais qui étaient introuvables au Québec! J'ai bien aimé! Ça se mange tout seul en marchant comme un cornet. C'est assez savoureux et les grands morceaux de pâte frite qu'ils rajoutent à la toute fin lui apporte un crunchy super intéressant. Aussi, à environ 6.90$ taxes incluses, on ne peut pas dire que l'on s'appauvrit! :-)"}
{"text":"Very good Beijing/Tianjin street food known as Jian Bing or pancake. The sauce they used really carried the flavor from my childhood memory growing up in Beijing."}
{"text":"This was definitely a treat! We opted for the double vanilla scoop topped with marshmallows and garnished with Pocky sticks. The warmth of the waffle made for a warm and indulgent bite of ice cream."}
{"text":"Excellent les gaufres, pris avec glace à la vanille et matcha. Pas trop sucrée juste ce qu'il faut . On choisit la base et la saveur des glaces nous même. Le service est du vite fait sans plus . Concernante prix je trouve que c'est un peu cher de plus pas de table vu que la boutique est minuscule. J'y retournerai prochainement"}
{"text":"I tried this place because it has been all over Instagram: the Hong Kong style egg waffle with different flavours of ice-cream topped with Poke sticks and cotton candy and others. The portion is generous but I have to admit that the lady didn't make the waffle well enough. Since I had the original egg waffle a lot during my childhood in China, I was having great expectations, but for the price I find the food quite good. The ice-cream was quite plain too, but for sure the hype is all about the beauty of the setup. I find the actually food a bit disappointing"}
{"text":"Best dessert around. Not so sweet. Just perfect and perfect size. You can also buy salty food. It is new. Try it !"}
{"text":"Girls, seriously, next time after you touch my money, can you wash your hands before making my waffle? I know you have your gloves on to show that your hands are \"clean\", but ummmmmmm, really? 

I know this is a new business and the girls are still learning, so I am giving a 3 stars review instead of 1 star. You can do it better girls."}
{"text":"Tried the combo 3 egg pancake. I was disappointed to see that they had cut a hot dog in half to put in the pancake. The person told me it was sausage... The sweet, salty, crispy, tender mix is a favourite of mine but this time, whatever it was, failed to impress me. Granted, it was big. But not worth paying almost 9$ to have a few bites. :("}
