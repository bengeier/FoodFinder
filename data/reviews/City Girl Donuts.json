{"text":"There are specialty donuts each day and all the donuts are really good. The coffee is good too. This is a really nice shop with very nice staff. The location is perfect as Rocky River needs a fun place to which the family can walk and grab a donut and coffee. 

I wish they opened a little earlier since they are a donut shop. I think they miss out on some business in the a.m. but this is a minor complaint."}
{"text":"We tried, really wanted to like. Love the location. However these donuts are terrible. Chewy and no flavor. It's a cross between a bagel and a donut with no defined heredity. And 3 dollars each. Go to Becker's instead. O"}
{"text":"I bought a variety of a dozen donuts for the office. Not one person liked them. They were dry and chewy. Some where even Oil on them. Weird. It was an interesting concept and we were all excited to try them but something is not right. I am hoping they perfect their recipes. I also bought some donut holes. Those were super dry. Ugh, I had so much hope that they would be amazing. I will try again in hopes they improve. ALSO-  VERY EXPENSIVE!!!"}
{"text":"Don't know how this place got anything less than 5 stars. So reasonable in pricing. Amazing donuts. We were frequent flyers to brew nuts but we are loving this place.. maybe a little more  we got a pear donut, a canolli donut, and a apple fritter. Can't wait to come back next weekend!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time. Had a simple glazed donut (a benchmark for any donut place) and a strawberry glazed with sprinkles. Enjoyed both. Very hard to find a donut that is not too sweet! Price for a simple glazed donut is $2.50, which might seem high, but the quality warrants it - glaze on the first donut had traces of vanilla bean, and strawberry glaze did not taste like Red#5, but had a lovely strawberry flavor, also not too sweet. Selection didn't seem too large, but I wanted to try every single thing offered. Will be making more trips back. 

The atmosphere was lovely and everyone seemed very excited to be there. Will be curious to see how it will be affected once moms with strollers and toddlers show up (I will be amongst them). 

To address the pricing - I'm in the camp of having one quality piece over a number of lesser price/quality things. Donuts are treats and should be treated that way. 

Small coffee was $2.00 and pleasant tasting. 

Frankly, I wouldn't leave a review had I not seen a one-star hater. Why do it, lady?"}
{"text":"I was highly underwhelmed at this shop. While the store was clean, inviting, and very cute, the service was chaotic. I've been to other shops like this where if they sell out they are closed for the day. I don't know how much they prepared for a gorgeous Sunday morning (one week into their opening), but when I got there around 11am they were sold out and making more. There was no menu of flavors, so I bought half a dozen (1 of each kind they had just made). Sadly, the donuts were tough and flavorless--I tried a simple glazed with sprinkles and it tasted like a bagel almost. I've had better donuts from Giant Eagle for much less!!! I think they could have been good if they were cooked longer but because they were rushing to get them out, they rushed to bake them. The service was also very odd: about 4 middle aged women behind the counter looking like they had no idea what was going on. Very poor planning and very disappointing for such a cute place. I hope they turn this around!!"}
{"text":"I had these donuts when they first open and wasn't really impressed. The overall flavors were great but couldn't get over the texture. A co worker order from Uber eats and when they came I was very surprised. The donuts were much larger and the texture was greatly improved. Would now recommend this shop to others to try some of there great flavors."}
{"text":"Fantastic donuts! Great, inventive flavors and the texture of the donut is nice. Very cute shop, too."}
{"text":"My husband and I are rocky river residents and were so excited for a new donut shop to open near us. After going the first week and finding they sold out of donuts, I was determined to go back and get some. Fast forward a week later and my husband and I are in the door and they are not sold out! We got a half dozen and thought it was a mistake when i was told the total was close to $16. Not only that but I was prompted to leave a tip as well. 

On the way to our car we look at each other and say  \"this better be worth it\". Our usual routine is Beckers Donuts which is 5.75 a half dozen, a third of the price, so if these do it's are not three times as good we are never going back. 

We bring these home to my parents and the minute we take a bite we are confused. They are thick, doughy, heavy and not at all sweet. The everything \"donut\" just tastes like a bagel that cost me $3 so truthfully it left a bad taste in my mouth. 

The glaze is thin and hardly gives this thick and bland donut a hint of sweetness. After trying a bite of the four kinds we got it was a unanimous decision to never go back. Not worth the money and even if they were not three times as expensive as our usual Beckers Donuts  but were cheaper I would still stick to Beckers. 

I gave two stars only because I like the atmosphere and if you want maybe a less sweet choice this will be your slice of pie but personally I would choose to walk a farther distance on a cold Saturday morning to get 6 delicious Beckers Donuts  for $5 then drive 30 seconds down the road in my warm car to over pay for less then adequate donut/bagel Frankenstein hybrids."}
{"text":"I tried three donuts- maple glazed long John, chocolate with Bavarian, and chocolate glazed. 

Maple glazed long John- first, it was easily 1/4 of the size of a normal long John (say from beckers or giant eagle). It was the only donut I could actually finish. The maple glaze was delicious (well what I could scrap off the box since I opened the box to it face down once I got into my car). The donut itself is so doughy it's hard to get through. There was very little filling, but what was there was great! I think it even had vanilla bean in it. 

Chocolate with Bavarian- my least favorite. Was very bitter. I couldn't even get through more than a couple small bites. The only filling I tasted was the little bit that came out of the sides and it was okay. Over all, the donut had zero sweetness and was just bitter. Maybe some people would enjoy that but I definitely didn't. Also very small.

Chocolate glazed- this donut was so doughy that my jaw was starting to hurt after two bites. Very little flavor at all. As a baker enthusiast (but not professional), I can't figure out if they are using too much flour, not enough yeast and sugar, if they mix it too long, or if they just don't let it double rise but something is off. It's like eating a circular piece of bread with a sweet-ish topping. This was a normal sized donut however. 

The place was very pretty inside, the owners were very friendly. I thought the massive box I got for my smallish donuts seemed wasteful and one flipped in the box. I couldn't see myself going back (unless the donut can be changed) but I'm glad I at least got to try a local business!"}
{"text":"Drove over from the east side to try City Girl Donuts and it was worth the trip.  The custom yeast donuts offer unique flavor combinations which I've never seen anywhere else. The donuts are mouth watering and are as beautiful to LOOK at as they are good to eat!  

I went for the berry glazed filled with homemade raspberry filling, topped with yummy dark and white chocolate shavings and blackberries.  Delicious!  The donut was not too sweet and you can tell these are handcrafted with care. Frankly these donuts could be offered as desserts in a high end restaurant. They also had pear custard filled, topped with glazed pear and vanilla marscapone plus those darn chocolate shavings.  And if banana custard is your thing....that's there too.  Obviously one needs to make more than one visit because one donut is filling.

The owner, Barbara, is passionate about her business and spent years planning before turning her dream into a reality.  I appreciate and choose to support locally run businesses.  City Girl also offers more traditional glazed, cake and long john donuts, and donut holes for the kids!  The prices ($2.50-3.00) may feel like sticker shock if you've only been to Dunkin' but really folks....if you'd pay $3.50 for an ice cream cone then this is a bargain.  

This was a very satisfying cross-town trip!"}
{"text":"Great experience at City Girl Donuts! Came in on a Saturday with my friend and her two kids. The donuts were delicious and the customer service was excellent. The staff was super friendly and conversational. You can tell they love what they do. Definitely worth it for a special weekend treat!"}
{"text":"I wandered into City Girl on a Wed. at 10 a.m.  Selection seemed a little sparse compared to pics and comments that I had previously seen/heard about this place.  Ended up with six donuts - creamsticks (maple glaze), lemon poppyseed, white glazed, creme bruleed top and lemon curd. Also did a coffee.

Synopsis - they were good.  Very good quality, as was the coffee. Size - the creamsticks were very small with the others average size - certainly not large, but also not small.

Now for the kicker - the price.  $3 each for the \"custom\" ones (lemon curd, creme bruleed I think) and $2.50 for the classic like the creamsticks and white glazed with sprinkes. Coffee, large was $2.25.  Total bill for 6 donuts and one coffee was $18.  That's where we differ on opinions - one of my co-workers who has been here feels the pricing is fine for fresh made, specialty donuts.  I, on the other hand, feel that they must \"blow my socks off - sincerely craving them\" at those prices.  While they were darn good, I just cannot see myself and wife going in to get 2 donuts each and 2 plain coffees and spending $15.  I guess to me a donut is still an inexpensive item where $2 - $3 for one of them is just too much.  I'll stick to Fragapane's in Bay Village where the creamsticks are still less than $1 and twice the size of City Girl.  Then again, that's just me!  I will certainly pop in here again, however it will probably be only a couple times a year."}
{"text":"Stood in the line on opening day to grab a few donuts and support local business. Having lived in Chicago for a number of years I was excited to taste a donut claiming to be similar to what I've had there. Unfortunately it was far from the tasty treats I've had in the Windy City. The donuts themselves were very bland...and not fluffy, which is what I was expecting. My wife and I sampled a dozen different options (which set us back over $25 so expectations were high!) and honestly didn't care for a single one. Best of luck to this local shop, but we won't be back for a second round."}
{"text":"By far my favorite donuts in Cleveland, and we have plenty of good donut shops.   The staff is always very friendly and you can often see the owner out working with the crew.    But really,  it's about the donuts,  isn't it?   And the donuts here are amazing. The dough is remarkably tender and the fillings and toppings are rich and decadent.  These are not your average grab a dozen and throw them in the conference room at work donuts.    These are a treat.  The coffee and teas are a good accompaniment for the sweet treats.   I constantly tell my friends and family about this place."}
{"text":"First of all, how does city girl donuts not have a 5 star rating? I have tried so many different donuts around CLE area & City Girl is top 5 in my opinion. I got the glazed donut with holiday sprinkles and it was SO good. The dough was so fresh, light & fluffy like it had just gotten out of the oven. This donut could have been plain with no glaze or sprinkles & I would still have devoured it. Also, the donuts are BIG but you won't want to share it, trust me."}
{"text":"We were skeptical to try this places out based on some of the reviews. To our surprise, amazing! The donut has great texture and taste, not too hard or too sweet. The everything and coconut chiffon are two of the best donuts I've ever had! Their coffee, americanos, and lattes are also spot on. We will be frequent visitors not only because of their donuts, but because of their superb service. Staff is exceptional!"}
{"text":"This is my first review on the app. Browsed this app for years and the only reason I leave a review now is because some of these reviews for City Girl seem a little crazy. I've been to City Girl a dozen times, as well as many of the other hot donuts establishments in greater Cleveland. City Girl is by far one of the best in town...better than Brewnuts. Save the gasp. It's pretty simple, show up at a reasonable time, expect to pay a little more than you would for dunkin and enjoy the quality. The cannoli donut is one of the best things I've ever eaten and it's not even my favorite donut there. I will continue to go back and sample what they've been whipping up. 10/10. Keep it up ladies."}
{"text":"Very chewy donuts and no flavor. The best item we purchased on our visit was a tee shirt. Really hope they can turn the place around. Giant Eagle Donuts are much better and they are cheaper. Have a long ways to go to complete with Becker's."}
{"text":"Pretty cool being able to have donuts delivered via urber eats. Got several , they all look great. Have only tried the Apple fritter which is delicious. Huge and not dry and has nice bits if Apple in it. Not all donut shops have fritters anymore so this was a real treat.  Wanted to try others like the maple and the vanilla glaze but they were out. Will have to order earlier next time. Way better than peace love donuts."}
{"text":"These are some of the best donuts I've had. Kinda surprised/disappointed it isn't rated higher. I'll see you ladies every Thursday for one of those huge Apple Fritters! You'll know it's me cause I'll probably stink and my eyes will be a little red ;)

Free donut perhaps??"}
{"text":"To be transparent, my wife owns a nearby bakery.  Now on to brass tacks. This place is superb. The doughs aren't super sweet so you can taste the toppings and flavors.  My favorites were  the Key Lime Meringue and the chocolate glazed fried cake. The space is gorgeous and the product was excellent. Nicely done City Girl, nicely done. The first to review this place seems like a jealous competitor to me. (Edit from here out) The competitors first to review has been filtered out leaving me in pole position... Still pretty disappointed by number of reviews lacking objectivity for this business.  Harsh tones without basis and calling out competing brands implies an ulterior motive. Turn your filter on when reading reviews of this business."}
{"text":"We were about to not stop here because of earlier reviews and we like airy non-cake-like donuts. They must have changed something because we were very positively surprised. The Cannoli Donut was awesome. Death by chocolate was also great, a little too rich for me, but my husband loved it. They had a midday coffee/donut deal while we were there. $3.50 for a coffee and donut. Not Spudnuts or Brecksville Donut Shoppe prices, but it is also a very different donut and shop."}
{"text":"We went to try City Girl Donuts today, as we enjoy supporting local businesses and love donuts.

However, we were met with disappointment. The donuts were horrible, they were saturated in what tasted like peanut oil, and the after taste was even more disgusting than the first bite.

The lemon meringue donut tasted like pure oil that saturated it, the filling tastes like lemon Lysol, and the meringue was burnt.

The strawberry glazed donut tasted nothing like strawberries, it only left the terrible taste of the oil which lingered on the tastebuds.

As for the lemon poppyseed donuts, don't get your hopes up. Saturated again with oil, and the glazed tasted extremely artificial.

We didn't even want to try the original glazed donuts after trying bites of the others, as our tastebuds couldn't bare it anymore and we were becoming ill from them.

$21.00 for 8 donuts was ridiculous, you definitely do not get your money's worth. If you want amazing donuts, go to Becker's or Biagio's, don't waste your time or money here.

I'd rather lick the bottom of a trash can than eat these donuts ever again."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after reading about it in the taste section of the Plain Dealer.  I was more then disappointed in the donuts.  They looked delicious, but tasted less then average.  I bought 14 donuts, sampling at least 6 different kinds.  The only donut that I would buy again was the everything donut.  The most disappointing aspect was the donut itself.  The texture and flavor were not good at all.  We brought them to a Browns tailgate and not one person liked the donuts."}
{"text":"I'm not usually a fan of donuts. Especially the ones that are sickly sweet. But these donuts are in a whole other category. They are a perfect doughnut. Brioche dough, perfectly baked, with inventive toppings and fillings. my current favorite is the pumpkin brulé. But the maple cream is a close second. And the cannoli doughnut was fab! but don't leave without trying the everything doughnut. It's a take on the everything bagel only better. also, coffee gets a solid A - huge bonus. the place itself is warm and inviting (nice place for a meet up) and the wallpaper in the bathroom warmed my own personal city girl heart!"}
{"text":"After checking out Brewnut's new space recently I was on a donuts kick and decided to pop into City Girl this weekend to see what they were all about. It's a nonchalant little space next to Danny Boy's and inside I would describe as clean industrial with a little feminine touch. So like simple, metal, white subway tiles, flowers, and some sayings framed on the walls. 

Staff appeared to be all older women (60's?) enjoying what they do and my wait in line was not too long. Donuts are $2.50 a piece and the special ones are $3. I purchased 3 donuts for $8. 

First things first, these yeast raised donuts are dense, I suppose I would describe them as the kind of bread that would be great for pulling apart and soaking up some hearty stew. Also, the dough is not that sweet. I prefer a light and airy texture but liked that the taste of the dough was simple. 

*Lemon Meringue - I got this one because it was the only special donut available. Not a fan. The lemon inside was extremely tart/sour. I tossed it after a couple exploratory bites. 
*Regular glazed - the best one I tried. Simple. Not overly sweet. Just a little too dense for me, I only ate the top half. 
*Strawberry with sprinkles - disappointed that you could barely pick up the strawberry flavor. It tasted plain. 

Overall, not a bad donut, but not a great one either. I think if they kicked up the flavor of their toppings it would balance out the dense simple dough more. If I get a strawberry glazed donut I want the glaze to taste like strawberries. Other Yelpers complained about a saturated peanut oil taste, I did not get that. These were not oily to me at all. Some also complained about size, the ones I got seemed like regular donut size. Not huge and not small. But I will have to agree with the complaints about pricing. Just because you're local doesn't mean you have to be expensive. If I'm paying $3 for a single donut it better be bigger than average and have outstanding flavor to it. 

I did want to say that I am annoyed by the quote from Barbara, the owner, on the website. She says \"When I've tried donuts in cities like New York, Chicago, and Seattle, I've wondered why no one had captured that donut experience here in Cleveland\". Girl, what are you talking about? We have plenty of donut shops here in Cleveland that provide a great experience for your mouth. You can check out Becker's, Jack Frost, Peace Love and Little Donuts, Spudnut's, or I prefer Brewnuts and Vegan Doughnut Co. What I am saying is that there are all kinds of different donut shops out there to satisfy your donut loving needs. So don't go saying Cleveland is missing something when what you brought to the table is lackluster."}
{"text":"I was in Rocky River and needed a snack so I figured I would check out City Girl Donuts.  Located on Lake Road City Girl is a cute space with plenty of white subway tiles with stainless steel accents.  Got there at about 1:30pm, but they still had some donuts left and a decent selection.  Doughnuts are $2.50 for basic ones and $3.00 for the fancy ones.

Wanted to try the sweet potato filled doughnut which looked great, but it had bacon on top, so instead I went with the Banana Creme filled doughnut.  The doughnut was very good; the doughnut itself is tasty, a bit old fashion, which is slightly heavier then most doughnuts.  The filling was somewhere between a creme and a banana puree, excellent banana flavor, not overly sweet.  Topped with a lighter creme and a thick slice of banana brulee that adds more pizazz.  

City Girl is a bit expensive, but they do provide a quality product with some culinary innovation.  If you are a doughnut fan I would give City Girl a try."}
{"text":"I have been anticipating the opening of this donut shop so my husband went today to get me a few to try. He said the place was nice and the service was good. He got a lemon poppyseed, maple stick and cannoli. The maple stick was the best of the three but unfortunately still not good. 

The prices seem very high ($2.50-$3.00) a donut and they are sadly unmemorable. The dough is very dense and dry, what you would expect from a day old or two day old donut. The cream filling didn't seem like cream filling at all and was only in about 2/3 of the donut. 

Best of luck to them but I prefer Donut Scene or Fragapane's maple stick!"}
{"text":"Great donuts -- perfect flavor, presentation, and textures! My faves are the maple long john, apple fritter; my daughter loves the cake donuts w/sprinkles. These donuts are on the bigger side -- plate and fork required."}
{"text":"First time here and ordered a variety of donuts.  The yeast dough was very tough and chewy, for starters, The Long Johns with custard were not up to par...the custard was grainy and not a generous portion for the price.  The buttercream in the maple Long John was delicious, but then again the dough was chewy.Cake donut was crumby...
The apple fritter was not bad, but still chewy.

Need to go back to basics and look at your yeast dough recipe.  Try donuts in 5-star places and compare textures and tastes if you want your business to flourish,  So sad!  Open only 1 month ..,,,"}
{"text":"Haven't tried them all but love what I have!  Great vibe and don't know whether to have them for breakfast or dessert or just any old time!  Ps...LOVE the coffee!"}
{"text":"My daughter and I bought 5 regular and 1 Long John the other day. Lemon Meringue, chocolate iced, strawberry iced, Berry filled, everything donut and a cannoli long john. First I will say they looked beautiful and we were excited to try them. Sadly after sampling each one we both were very disappointed. They donut part was dry and had a strange aftertaste. The icing on the two iced rings was thin and cracked off. A few of the filled donuts and the long john donut were hardly filled . Not sure I'd even call theses donuts.....more like a donut style dessert. We always support local and small family run businesses and the concept is awesome. Truly hope they can work through there issues and come up with a better tasting, better quality product. I don't mind paying the price if something is actually worth it!"}
{"text":"I went back this week and gave the Donuts a second try. I will say they are much improved. Gone is the heavy bread like consistency. They are more like traditional donuts.  I still have a hard time paying $25 for a dozen. But will stop in from time to time. 


Old review below 

Based on the anticipation I was expected to be blown away by the $25 a dozen donuts. Sad to say I was not.  The donuts were very dense and flavorless.  I expect a donut to be light texture and sweet which these are not.  I can only guess they are trying to appeal to a more health conscious client.   

However, the staff is very friendly and the coffee is awesome.  I will make it a frequent coffee stop.  I feel bad they missed the mark on the donuts."}
{"text":"Cute donut shop with a lot of potential. I love the number of local businesses in this area and am always happy to see another open. 

We found this shop as we were heading into Danny Boy's for lunch and quickly decided that this should be dessert. Since we stopped in near closing there wasn't a huge selection which I completely understand since it was so late in the day. I'd love to return another time earlier in the day to see the full selection.

I ordered a donut with apple topping. I liked the flavor of the donut overall. The donut texture was okay, but not my favorite compared to other donuts.  It was still a good donut though. My husband enjoyed his donut.  Overall, we liked our donuts, but I can't say it was anything that would make me go out of my way to return."}
{"text":"The donuts are pretty okay. They are very dense, full of flavor, and not toooo sweet. If you like light and airy then this may not be your joint.

We hit up City Girl on a Saturday around 11am and they had just about sold out of everything so we were limited to: lemon poppyseed, chocolate glaze, maple stick, and cannoli stick. The stick donuts were tiny. Like REAL SMALL. Half a dozen set us back almost $16. They were really good, and fresh. Not sure if they were worth the $16.... except for a special occasion? 

I don't know, I'm conflicted. The donuts were decent but that's a lot of money for 6 donuts!!! The spot is cute and urban. Parking kind of sucked. Would I go back? Yes. I would go earlier than 11am on a weekend to have prime picking. Only then so I think I could be non biased. In the meantime, staff was friendly, the shop was cozy, and the donuts were good in small doses."}
{"text":"Always ready for an adventure across town so what better reason that a donut.  Much to my delight, the bakery case was filled with a wide assortment, 11 to be exact of fabulous looking donuts.  Banana cream, mixed berry, pear cannoli , just to name a few.  I tried one of my favorites, a chocolate glazed cake donut and my friend had the huge cannoli donut.  Both were so fresh and delicious.  We both had a cup of wonderful coffee to go with in and were offered free refills.  Definitely a place we will come back to.  Great donuts and the staff were so friendly."}
{"text":"Oh I so wanted to love this place!
Alas I am very much on the fence with this review.
My foodie husband and I planned our visit for early Saturday morning after learning City girl donuts had opened.

We stood in line with the 40+ others or so who had the same idea. Took us about 20 minutes to get to the front of the line not bad when considering we were in a fairly leisurely Saturday morning mood.

The flavor selection was reasonable and we decided to buy half a dozen with plans to share with our daughter when we got home.
We chose only yeast styles: pumpkin crème brûlée, plain glazed,  strawberry glazed with sprinkles, lemon meringue , cannoli, and a maple long John.
Spoiler alert, the 1, 2 & 3 star reviews were warranted.
I do love the entrepreneurial spirit of opening your own business but I just feel as if a little more time perfecting the product was/is needed. Of special note. The staff was friendly and efficient. 

I do appreciate the less sweet version of a donut delicacy but please make it more flavorful. 
The uniformity in size is lacking. Some donuts were easily 25% smaller than others a disparity not lost on the customers in front of us or even the staff who made it a point to say they would pick out the bigger ones for us.
Ok now for the individual donut reviews, from all 3 of us: 
Dough: blah, lacks flavor.. I'm ok with it not being sugary sweet, but my family missed the sweetness.
Plain glazed: blah, lacked flavor 
Strawberry glazed: same, plus sprinkles ruined it.
Pumpkin Creme Brulé: I enjoyed the glaze of burnt sugar on top providing that needed kick of sweetness, but it would have been better to have something added to the unsweetened canned pumpkin inside.
Cannoli: good cannoli filling but may have been better with mini chocolate chips in the filling.
Maple long john : sadly more than 2/3 of the donut did not have any filling in it at all and the side that did had very very little. 
Lemon Meringue: my favorite. Lemon was delicious. Crusty meringue topping added a nice touch.

Coffee: a light blend but very satisfying. 

All in all I would advise anyone with a curiosity for something new and different to try it out. Be prepared for steep prices as we paid $18.50 for 6 donuts and a small coffee. As for my family I will say it was probably a miss and we will probably only stop in a few times per year."}
{"text":"Very dense, bread-y donuts. (I tried the cannoli for $3--so, yeah, pricey too.) Not a lot of flavor, unfortunately. 

Nice  counter help, though. 

I like to support small businesses so I feel awful saying I prefer Giant Eagles' lighter-textured (and cheaper) yeast donuts.  Sorry.

(Probably just as well. The last thing I need is another tempting donut shop. Good thing Jack Frost is so far away. LOL)"}
{"text":"Went to City Girl Donuts this weekend after hearing a lot about it and deciding to invite them to participate in a work event. I got a coconut donut and the death my chocolate. The place is cute, but small inside with maybe 4-6 tables. I got the donuts to go. The coconut was good, but not wonderful. The death by chocolate though was AH-MAZ-ING! It was huge and stuffed with a chocolate ganache filling.

Donuts were $3 each for these as they were considered specialty."}
{"text":"I give them 3 months. Who's buying $25 doz. doughnuts, that aren't even good? Its a fad shop that will close as soon as the \"I'll check them out\" people stop coming. I love to support local business but not sure if this place will last. Besides the funky flavors, Salt & Pepper everything doughnuts??? The doughnuts themselves really are not good, very oily tasting.   They nailed the branding of the place, logos everywhere and on everything. They need to focus on the product."}
{"text":"Hey, I had a healthy skepticism of your donuts based on the reviews on Yelp and Facebook. However, today was the first time I tried your fine donuts. The ratio of cakes to icing, the texture, and the taste all lined up perfectly for me. It was so delightful. Thank you. 

My only criticism may be that it was too big!! Hahaha! Honestly, that is a large donut."}
{"text":"First time visiting. Very yummy donuts love how beautiful they look almost too beautiful to eat, also had an amazing delicious latte. The staff is very friendly the decor is modern and chic and the shop is very clean. The prices are very reasonable. We got the cannoli donut and the raspberry donut. I was very surprised and happy to see it was homemade raspberry jam inside not the process stuff that most places put in."}
