{"text":"Hidden  treasure in Mississauga
Located at the food court, hard to find it unless you are not local folks.
Super resasonable  rates ( mostsly $7  or $8  with all inclusive )
Gourmet Korean Food.      

My favorite place."}
{"text":"Very good korean fast food. The couple worked there was nice all the time. Price is little sheap than restaurant.  But food are testy. Good place for some take out."}
{"text":"Keep coming back for the pork bone soup! It comes with kimchi and rice. Random location but the food is comforting and the portions are generous! Great bang for your buck. I always leave with my craving satisfied."}
{"text":"Good bang for your buck! Owners were so adorable and friendly. Short ribs were perfectly cooked and seasoned, sweet, succulent, and tender. Gamjatang, was good, although not the best I've had but the fried fish was delicious! Who would have thought a such a ghetto mall would have such a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Owned by a lovely elderly couple.. they're so polite and humble (no tip jar! .. there should be one though) 

The food is absolutely amazing! Some of the best Korean I've had. The cold noodle is 10/10, and I've had MANY cold noodles. Also the spicy rice cake is very nice. 

Price is amazing. Menu is Mostly under $10 and there is no tax."}
{"text":"The food here is so tasty yet crazy cheap!!! Very cute Korean couple run this place. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I like eating here at semi's. The food is tasty and the service great! I enjoy eating semi's Korean food in this decrepit Newman mall.

I just don't like the awkwardness I get if I eat here or there from semi's Korean competition."}
{"text":"Tip:  CASH ONLY!  There is an unmarked ATM nearby, but we all know those are sketchy.

Husband isn't the friendliest, rather apathetic actually.  Wife is friendlier.

PBS is now $9, so isn't that comparable to a restaurant?  However, it does come with a full bowl of rice (unable to finish), a small bowl of kimchi, and a tea.  PBS was decent, not super complex in flavour.  The one I ordered yesterday had no potatoes.

Still takes a bit of time, so again, it isn't fast food!"}
{"text":"A small little family owned restaurant located in a food court of a mall. The owners are very friendly. The food is pretty good for the price.

The food served hot and fresh. The service is quick. Great place for something cheap and quick. 

I usually get their soups here, it's nicely seasoned and flavourful. 

Recommended !"}
{"text":"Stop by Newin Centre to grab some lunch since I had to pick up some family members here. We got PBS, Teriyaki Chicken, and wonton soup with rice cakes.
All meals came with tea, rice, and kimchi. The 3 meal came up to $24 which is a really good deal! Service was really fast for all three meal, took a total of 10 minutes. 

Teriyaki Chicken
It had some bean spouts, cucumber, carrots, lettuce and rice. I felt that it was a bit salty for this dish. It tasted average but still good meal. 

Pork Bone Soup
The soup base was tasty but not the best I had in the city. The pork was soft and had good taste to it as well. 

Wonton & Rice Cake Soup
Has allot of wontons and rice cakes in this soup! Usually other restaurants gives me 4-5 rice cakes in the soup. Tasted pretty good overall. Not salty at all. 

Overall, it's really good place for lunch if you want something fast and hearty. But beware it's kinda dirty in this food court and not really appealing looking. Its a good bargain for all the meal here; But I wouldn't really go back since there's so many other good Korean restaurants in the gta."}

Super cheap and tasty Korean food, in the food court one of our sketchiest \"malls\" called: The Newin Centre. :P

The owners are super polite and friendly.

My favourite dish is #28: gam-ja zim (sweet pork bone soup). 

At an affordable $7, this tasty (and loaded) soup comes with kim chi, giant bowl of rice, and cup of tea. This soup differs from the traditional pork bone soup in that it is not too spicy but it's VERY flavourful. It's a super yummy option for those like myself who can't handle that much heat. :P I haven't found another place that sells something like this! Also, instead of potatoes, it comes with ramen noodles at the bottom - which I love. :)
 
I've recommended this to several people now, and they all love it too. It's great for a cool autumn day or chilly winter's day! So soothing - my favourite comfort food.

Semi also has other good inexpensive favourites: bulgogi, bibimbap, and the traditional gam-ja tang. But #28 is my regular. ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've gotten the gamjatang every time that I come and it's delicious - it comes with a very generous portion of (super tender) meat, rice, kimchi and pickled cucumbers and barley tea for only $8 including tax. The food court itself is a bit dingy but I don't mind since I like the food so much. The owners are also very nice and friendly so this place gets 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"I came here the same night I went to Feast in the same tiny fairly run down food court. Also a family owned business, we ordered the Bibimbop; it came with a miso soup and kimchi. The owners were very nice but the food was unfortunately a bit lacking.
The kimchi was under seasoned, the bibimbap had a strange non traditional veggie in it (it might have been lettuce) and the soup was a miso, likely from a powder mix.
It wasn't the worst Korean I've had. The price was good, but for the same amount of money, I was far more impressed by Feast. Their storefront was also very cluttered and confusing to read."}
