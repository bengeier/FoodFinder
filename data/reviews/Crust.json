{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places! The crust really is that good. Ive tried just plain cheese, roasted red peppers, and mushrooms -- all great. Make sure you get a drink though -- it can get a little salty. Best eaten fresh, not as good reheated later."}
{"text":"We recently discovered Crust.  We went for the pizza and have returned for the dining experience.   We dine out several times a week and this restaurant rises above the rest.  The pizza is amazing but we keep returning for the appetizers, pastas, drinks and more.  The desserts are worth saving room for!  This establishment does everything right. The staff are professionals in service they have great intuition about your pace and overall epicurean adventure."}
{"text":"AMAZING rustica pizzas, great atmosphere. When I'm not feeling like wine (great wine list) the cocktails are awesome. Such great service too - I've walked in before 15 minutes before closing (and I knew I was pushing it) but they were happy to feed me. Thank you Crust for your sincere and solid service and amazing food - I'll be in again soon!"}
{"text":"Unbelievably good calzone.  I've been looking for a good one all over the metro area.  This one's the real deal.  Great wood-burning stove, and delicious crust.  Thus, the name."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. BEST IN CLEVELAND. And reasonably priced. They allege their ingredients are all from scratch: hand tossed dough, hand cut tomatoes and meat, and sauce made from scratch. Amazing taste. Friendly staff. And an iPad for a cash register :) patio looks like it would be amazing for warm months especially with the great nightlife nearby, but the indoor seating is lacking. Must go!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Drove by this place numerous times on my way to other pizza joint. Bad decision! We decided to give it a try and man I'm glad we did. Seriously the best pizza I've had hands down. Great bar selection and great Italian food aside from pizza. Give it a shot, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I dream about this pizza it is so delicious.  You have to get a couple sides of the homemade ranch to dip the crust in.  It's heaven.   The only bummer is, is that it's not very good reheated the next day so plan on eating it all the day you get it."}
{"text":"We just recently used Crust catering and it was phenomenal! The customer service from booking the date to the delivery and service of  delicious food! Everyone loved the food! Crust even followed up the next day to ask how everything went. I highly reccommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Lemon Rosemary Chicken pizza. It was the most amazing pizza ever. Orgasm in my mouth, for real. Fortunately I don't live in Ohio, but unfortunately that means I can't eat here everyday. If I ever find myself back in Cleveland I'll be popping in. Totally recommend coming here."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times I've had a great experience. The first trip I tried the lemon rosemary chicken pizza and the second trip I had the butternut squash pizza. Both were amazing. Their hand tossed crust is so good...I can't wait to try their gnocchi next time.  Also, one of the employees' grandma makes homemade cheesecake and brings it in every week. It is incredible.   The owner is here is so nice and pleasant to talk to!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!  Gluten friendly,  extremely accommodating!  Made to order fresh pizza coming to you in a timely manner!"}
{"text":"the Sicilian style and desserts are great! I look forward to trying more menu options."}
{"text":"I've gotta tell ya that this was (I think) the last in the list of pizza places that I needed to try in the area.  In many respects, I saved one of the best for last.  In fact, this is going to fill in beside Grimaldi's as my fave.  They are so different and so good.  The place is small and there isn't much of a bar but our server was attentive and sweet.  My friends ordered a 20 pie and they just bring out half of the pizza so that we have enough room and they keep the other half warm.  Great move.  I ordered one of their Rustica pizzas.  I was very surprised at the delivery.  It was like a HUGE triangular slice.  They call it personal size, but they are being generous.  Its big.  The waitress talked me into the \"Spaghetti and Meatballs Rustica.  WOW!  They put noodles on the pizza itself!  It was awesome.  There was so much else to try.  Being a wine cafe I would guess that they have good vino but I don't care too much about that.  Based on the quality of the za I must think that everything is good.  Plus, they have wheat crust or gluten free!   The music was a little loud.  Nobody was really into the music.  It wasn't that kinda crowd but whatever.  It wasn't horrible and I can live with it for the service and the pizza."}
{"text":"Visited for dinner and while it was not very busy on a Saturday evening.  We ordered a Pizza and a Strumboli and gosh we were pleasantly surprised.    The personal pizza was wonderfully presented, excellent thin crust that was well done and with topping that were both fresh and bursting with flavor.  The size of the pizza was more in ines of a Personal Plizza Plus :).    The  Strumboii was a piece of art.  Never have I seen such a thin crust hold a plethora of sausage.  Most Strumboli's are quite hollow inside and lack much of a meat, but this was certainly one for the history books.  Gotta end on a sweet note and tis been ages since I have tasted a cannoli that is so fresh and so flavorful.  I will surely visit again when I am in the area as it truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Very poor service, came during sports hours. Staff refused to change it to a station we of our interest. They do have 5 T.V.s  Was actually told \"I am busy.\"   Beside that the pizza was doughy with a minimal amount of cheese. Salad was overpriced and just average, and calamari sauce was watery. Staff were advised how upset we were after telling them I had a groupon and suddenly tried to be cordial.  Left wanting to go to Costco for pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland! Consistent quality and great staff.  My family eats here every chance we get. Great family atmosphere! A must for any pizza lover."}
{"text":"Yup, I'm a fan!!! this place is defenitly a hidden gem, nice slice pizza for a great price. I got a cheese pizza and added a few toppings- he made a lunch combo for $5bucks!! Check them out-you will luv them..."}
{"text":"The Unlce Louie rustica is amazin'  and so is the spinach artichoke dip. Can't wait to try more more of the menu."}
{"text":"I will start with the good becasue I do really like this place.  I have had crust twice now (a pepperoni and a spanish chorizo pizza), and both times it was delicious.  The pizza tastes fresh and doesnt leave you with the feeling that you dumped a jar of salt in your mouth (Edisons).    I have attempted to try the gnocchi and subs on several occasions.  Unfortunately, this place closes at 7 p.m. on the weekdays.  For those of us who arent 85 years old, this usually doesnt work.    This place is in tremont, which is not exactly a hot spot for lunch (seeing as how most restaurants arent even open for lunch).  So having a pizza establishment open from 11-7 really does not make much sense to me.     So, if you find yourself craving pizza at 4 pm, I would definitely hit up crust.  But if your schedule is like 90% of the rest of the world, you might have to settle for edison's."}
{"text":"Crust is great! I went there for a slice of pizza this past Saturday and came back soon after for their Italian sub... Both were very good. If I lived near Crust... I'd way four hundred pounds....   Go here and enjoy!"}
{"text":"I hesitate to write a glowing review because then it will make this great restaurant even more crowded, but it really deserves all 5 stars!    My fiance and I have been going to Crust for a year and a half or so and have always had amazing meals.  The wait staff have always been helpful and friendly, even before they recognized us as \"regulars\".  TOMATO TARTAR: I can't eat at Crust without having their version of bruschetta, it's absolutely amazing.  It was a sad day when during the tomato recall of 2008 they weren't serving it.  ROLLATINI (calzone): This is my usual go-to item.  The crust is crisp and buttery with just enough chewiness.  The ingredients are always fresh, the pepperoni tastes great and the cheese is smooth.  RUSTICA (pizza): My fiance usually gets the Margharita rustica, not because of the \"unusual\" shape, but because it tastes so great!  BASIC PIZZA: The kids love the standard thin-crust cheese pizza (and these are picky kids, believe me). and indeed they will keep one half of this large (18\"?) pie near the oven so it doesn't get cold, but we frequently get this to go.  CHICKEN PARMESAN: Two large breasts, perfectly breaded and smothered in their tomato sauce.  I'm a big guy and I've never been able to finish this plate.  MAC-N-CHEESE: This is the one dish that I think could have done better. It tasted great, but it came out blister-hot and just wouldn't cool down in the cast-iron dish.  When it finally did cool down it congealed and became a bit gluey.  It tasted fine, but it wasn't my favorite.  BAKED ZITI: Another great dish, but beware that it can be very hot (to the touch), comes in a cast-iron dish and stays very warm.  CONS: The only thing I dislike (as another reviewer mentioned) is the TV screens.  They always seem to have \"the game\" on, but fortunately I don't recall the volume is ever turned up.  They don't really need them IMO.   Reserve the big center table for your large party (we brought a large group totalling 8 people once) and enjoy the great food!"}
{"text":"Crust is around the corner from my house and we felt like grabbing a bite to eat last night so we thought we'd give it a try. Boy are we glad we ventured over there!   You walk in and it's very nicely decorated with some high top tables, some booths and some regular sized tables. There is also bar space where you can sit and enjoy a drink and appetizer or even dinner. The service was great. Very attentive. They gave us plenty of time to look over the menu and it was much needed. There were so many things that I wanted to order!   I narrowed it down to the skinny guy sandwich which is Grilled chicken, sauteed eggplant, roasted peppers & fresh mozzarella drizzled with extra virgin olive oil & balsamic vinegar. I got it on whole wheat and the bread was fresh and soft. The fresh basil and fresh mozzarella definitely made this sandwich. It was amazing. I also had a small greek salad and the tomatoes were farm fresh and the dressing was light and flavorful.   My boyfriend had the steak sandwich which was Filet mignon, mushrooms & onions with melted mozzarella servedon garlic bread. He barely spoke the entire meal because he was shoveling the sandwich in. He even went so far as saying that it was the best sandwich he's had in a long time!  The portion sizes were huge and the appetizers looked rather large as well. The wine was a little pricey but they have monthly wine selections on special and they also had a wine special for the day for $5 a glass which was great! We will DEFINITELY be back and plan to make this a frequent happy hour stop. I can't wait to try the chicken francese served over linguine. It looked amazing!!  Oh, and the canolis are 1.25 and a perfect way to round out the dinner. It's tiny but well worth the 1.25 and to me a perfect size for a little sweet snack after dinner."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Thursday afternoon, and got a Spanish Chorizo pizza and an Eggplant sub for a friend, and wow, I was very impressed.  Fresh ingredients, and prompt service, and hell, if your going to call your restaurant \"Crust\", then the crust better be great, and happily it was.  It was a bit pricy, but you get what you pay for. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"We are staying at a nearby hotel and wanted to grab some take out pizza.  We live in California and have never tasted pizza this good.  We got the Uncle Louie a Caprese Salad and the Tiramisu.  First class all the way."}
{"text":"Really good. Owner was a great guy, food was excellent. Location is cool but it's a shame they aren't somewhere they can get more exposure. I'd go back in a heartbeat. Grandma's cheesecake was delicious! :)"}
{"text":"Ick. We were excited to taste such a highly reviewed pizza place. We live in Ohio City and we love pizza, but Edison's never really hit our mark. We didn't want to order pizza from Brooklyn, so we figured we trek over to Tremont for a slice at Crust--man what a mistake! We both immediately got belly aches and regretted spending the bones on this overcooked, under-sauced mess called pizza. It was cool that the pizza slice was a big as two plates, but really who wants to eat that much ick-filled pizza. Terrible. I appreciate the effort, but seriously, soooo bad. Perhaps a whole pizza would be better, but really after sinking $6 in two inedible slices, who'd pay for a whole pie?"}
{"text":"The best mac and cheese in Scottsdale, AZ!  The friendly staff makes for a wonderful dining experience.  Can't think of anything negative with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Finally! An amazing cheese pie! My fiance is from Long Island and we've been all around the Valley trying to find something that comes close to the delicious pizza of his past. They have some great wine and food specials and serve yummy gelato on site. Their pizza salads are really great as well. If you're in the area, definitely stop by this gem, they won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"These friends folks have very nice pizza served on very large wooden boards."}
{"text":"Last year we ate here (Tremont, Fall 2014). The huge slice we had then was amazing. The crust had the spices baked right in, so even the edge of the crust was delicious. The three guys behind the counter told us the painstaking process of making the dough, the Grande cheese, and the special sauce -  and we understood why it was amazing. Went back in October and had same experience.  Fast forward to Aug 2015. The Tremont location was staffed by a bunch of surly kids. Got 2 pizzas. The cardboard crust was crisp but tasteless. Wondering if with the expansion they've lost their handle on quality control or they've purposely changed the recipes. Please give us back the crust we remembered!"}
{"text":"A few weekends ago the hubs and I went to a hot air balloon festival at the Salt River Fields. Sadly, it was cold and windy, so our night of hot air balloon magic was shot by 8pm. On our way home we decided to stop by Crust for some dinner and drinks - we were both starving.  This place is small, but has many tables. The atmosphere is kind of loud, but is dark and soon you don't even hear the noise around you.   The first thing we did (as usual) was open the wine list and see what we could get. I was a little disappointed when I saw the wine prices. I am not a great wine drinker. I do not have discriminating tastes. At most restaurants you find a range of prices on the glasses and bottles so cheapskates and non-fancy people like me can enjoy a glass of vino for around $6 - $8. They did not offer anything under $11 a glass - which is fine, but I was a little sad (again, unfancy cheapie = me).  We ended up ordering some garlic knots - SO delicious but SO unhealthy. I loved them :). We also ordered their equivalent of a calzone, which was yummy. We had thought about ordering a pizza, but wanted to try something different. Next time we go we are definitely ordering some pizza, as all of the tables around us were enjoying some and it looked GOOD! Def recommend you stop by - hooray for hole-in-the-walls :)."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!  Great prices and service!  Thrilled to have found this spot!  Their Spanish chorizo pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"This was my first time to Crust and I have to say it was total deliciousness! Will definitely return with my co- workers!"}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite places. I went three times in two weeks, and it's not exactly around the corner from my house. I come here for the pizza rustica which is an individual pizza shaped like a huge slice, cut up into smaller slices and served on a bread board. The wine selection is nice, but all of the wines are a bit pricey per glass. It would be great if there were a few nice budget options. I end up paying more for my drink then my dinner! It's a great place though with a wonderful atmosphere (even if it is tucked in a strip mall). Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"According to Jimmy Buffet what is the eighth deadly sin?..............................  Pizza! After a trip to the far east where I got a pizza made with puff pastry dough I was ready for the real thing. I've read other reviews of this place and wanted to try it. The restaurant is on the small side, but has a modern comfortable feel to it. Having read other Yelper's reviews I went straight for the Meat Rustica pizza. I know what you are thinking, but I like thin crust pizza. After a beer and more than a few minutes, the pizza arrived. Now I guess everyone has their own point of view, but I think the pizza looks like a bikini bottom. Anyway, the pizza was flavorful and not dripping with grease. It was the perfect size for lunch so I finished it. The only thing that I wished they had done was cook it a tad more. Now it might had been the fresh tomatos, but the middle of the pizza was not crispy. Not soggy, but I would like it a bit crispier. I will be back to sample more of their food and sin some more."}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend over the holidays before our flight back home to Michigan. We needed a restaurant to go to for a few hours to wait for our ride to the airport. Right away I could tell I was going to like this place. The atmosphere in the restaurant was solid. They really did a great job with the decor. The waitress was extremely friendly! I was concerned about bringing in all our luggage, but she had no issue with. We ordered two thin crust pizzas. One was \"The NY,\" and the other was \"The Uncle Louie.\" Both were excellent! If I am ever in that area in the future I will definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"We have visited this place often in the past as our office is close. The food is wonderful and the two pizza makers rock!! However the service is always hit or miss, mainly a miss unless the pizza chefs help us out. We sit at the bar so the service should be excellent. The waitress who is always there is rude and full of attitude. If not for her our visits would have been awesome! We would visit one to three times a week but now choose to support other businesses because of the service."}
{"text":"I've been here twice- had some pizza, calzone and a Tuscan arugula salad. All were good. Great wine selection. Friendly staff. I would recommend."}
{"text":"The pizza is dry. I think maybe because it's thin crust. The sub sandwiches are good. The ultimate Italian is very good."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Cleveland IMO.   Thin NY style done perfect.    Cool little shop you get a great vibe...customer service and pride in product."}
{"text":"The uncle Louie pizza is amazing! A little spice from the sausage and a healthy portion of basil. I have an actual uncle Louie so it makes it even better. Good happy deals also ($5 any glass of wine)!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience! Friendly and prompt service, an awesome happy hour menu, comfortable and chic atmosphere. I ordered the Italian chopped salad (fresh, flavorful, generously portioned), while my friend ordered the pappardelle bolognese (11/10! honestly, not exaggerating, this was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted). AND THE TIRAMISU OH GOD it's pure bliss served in a heaping portion. It was all together about $50 for a three course meal for two w/o alcohol (but with plenty of leftovers!!). We will DEFINITELY be coming back."}
{"text":"Hands Down best pizza in temont!  HUGE Slices and super fresh!"}
{"text":"My friend and I appreciate Crust's friendly service, wine samples and, of course, their entertaining Rusticas!! The pizzas are unique and tasty and the staff does a great job helping us wine novices find wines that are amicable to our palettes and complementary to our meal. The prices are certainly reasonable for the cuisine that is served but they also regularly offer great wine and food deals every week. Dining at Crust is fun, relaxed, and delicious, making it our \"go-to\" spot!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Nice thin crispy crust, homemade sauce and the sausage is to die for."}
{"text":"Wow!  Just wow!  Found this place from Corey on Fox 10.  Even the coffee was awesome!"}
{"text":"I love everything about Crust. Have only patronized this location, but it has never disappointed. Best NY Style pizza parlor I have come across in CLE so far.  I know there are excellent Neapolitan style joints popping up all across the city but as a native New Yorker, I consider those to be an entirely different category.   Crust is where you get a legit slice,  Also love there Salads!"}
{"text":"Tremont finally gets an amazing Italian pizza and sandwich shop. They even have  gnocchi and great salads. This is a perfectly designed and complementary new restaurant for the rest of the fabulous restaurants in Tremont. The quality of the ingredients and food is spectacular and the prices are great given the high quality of the food."}
{"text":"Diane is amazing, best bartender I've ever had. Food is great. Awesome time every time I go. Reminds me of the East Coast, like the food back home; really good Italian food."}
{"text":"EVERYTIME!!! my food is Awesome and the service is so comforting . . I LOVE IT!! I really need to stop ordering my sliders. . but I am addicted to them. . .Service is the best you can get and the food is awesome. . .BEST PIZZA / WINE BAR EVER !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Dined at Crust on a slow Friday night.  My wife and I ordered an app  for a starter, and two entrees.  We received the app soon after we ordered, but the entrees took over 45 minutes, maybe just under an hour, to arrive after we received the app.  I asked the waiter where our food was, and how soon will we get it.  He said 3 minutes, it took a lot longer then 3 minutes.  At one point the waiter asked us what we ordered.  I'm guessing he asked that, because he forgot to place the order, or lost the ticket.  We have had a few good meals in there, but the last 2 have been terrible.    We won't be back!"}
{"text":"I am a pizza traditionalist (plain cheese, yummy crust, thin or hand tossed), and their plain cheese is very good. Personally I prefer Edison's, but Crust is a great deal for the price, and if I'm feeling a little fancy. Their specialty pizzas are not to be missed, I especially like the mushroom with balsamic drizzle. Service is friendly, and they sometimes have GLASS BOTTLE sodas (my favorite!). The slices are huge, but the crust itself (which is what the place is known for), isn't the greatest, IMO. It becomes rock hard and inedible the next day, unless you want to chip a tooth. I always have to throw it away, and I hate wasting food, esp the best part of the pizza!   Don't miss the gnocchi. Big, chewy, delicious. Comfort food at its best."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh pizza, even for carry out - I just love that they salt the crust. Yum!!!!"}
{"text":"Deeeelicious!! I wasn't expecting much based on the location of this joint - strip mall off of Indian Bend and Hayden, but I should know that these are actually some of the best restaurants! Loved the atmosphere inside - plenty of comfy booth seating; loved the service - drink was never empty, service was prompt; and most of all loved the food!  We ordered the Buffalo salad to start.  This was the best version of a Caprese salad I've ever had. It was atop fresh crispy lettuce and there were roasted bell peppers thrown in, too.  I loved how thin the mozzarella was sliced and how tasty the tomatoes were.  For our main entrees, the three of us ordered individual pizzas. Two of us ordered the Bella Rosa.  This had a tomato pesto, sun dried tomatoes, and basil on a whole-wheat crust.  So not only was this absolutely amazing and crispy to perfection, but it was fairly healthy! My dad had a pizza with mozarella and tomatoes, which he ate every last bite of.  I love how thin and crispy the crust is, how they serve the individual pizzas on a big cutting board (with enough pizza to take home leftovers!), and how the prices are pretty reasonable.  For three pizzas, a large salad, a coke, and tea the bill was $38.  I will definitely be returning to this place soon!"}
{"text":"Great pasta and calzone.  The music was too loud but otherwise pleasant.  Kids meal is plentiful for $5 for pasta."}
{"text":"We tried thin crust pizza, calamari, meatballs and calzone (they call them something different) Everything was so good we couldn't stop sampling.  All was fabulous.  So good we took an eggplant pizza home for later.  Best pizza I've ever had this side of Italy and same for the calamari. Meat balls were tender and their sauce is fresh uncomplicated and yummy, So happy we found this gem of a spot.  Just wish it was in No Scottsdale,  but we'll make the drive!"}
{"text":"Yummy!! Delicious food and wonderful service! Great for dates, growing families, and social gatherings. Love it!"}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise. It's a hidden gem for sure. Great authentic Italian and great service as well. The whole team is very welcoming."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Went here for a happy hour/dinner.     Great wine at a great price.   The thing that hooked me was their gluten free food.   I haven't seen gluten free ravioli at any other restaurant before.   It was awesome.   I would defiantly recommend their cheese board as an appetizer as well.   Service was amazing.  I think our servers name was Shawn.  Perfectly lit restaurant as well.   I'll be back here with my Lady for sure.  I don't have a single negative comment."}
{"text":"We have been to Crust twice now. I have to say that the gnocchi is the best I ever had! Next time I am back in Cleveland, I am definitely stopping again!"}
{"text":"Great spot for pizza (the meat rustica is our fave), salad and wine. Staff is always super friendly- give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"i live in tremont and have enjoyed crust many times."}
{"text":"This was so so so so good great service great food make sure you get the Mediterranean sandwich that was the first one I had and plan on going back at least 5 more times this month just to try out a few more things and a pizza. don't think I will be dissatisfied."}
{"text":"Delicious and we had great service! The food tasted fresh loved the atmosphere. They even only brought out half or our pizza and gave us the option of asking for the other half when we were done or boxing it up which was great because it stayed warm and the pizza was huge. Def my new Go to place and I can't wait to take my family when they come and visit. Get the fried mozzarella!"}
{"text":"Tried for over and hour and can't get through...its 6:30 on a Saturday...was really looking forward to trying their pie..will change review if I get through....annoyed"}
{"text":"Echoing Christopher: Ask for the arugula-balsamic salad on top of cheese pizza.   I still haven't had better pizza than Crust."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant!  The Rustica pizza is our favorite.  It's got a nice thin crust with just the right amount of mozzarella cheese and sauce, topped with fresh basil.  But you have to try the large Greek Salad.  Big enough for two people to share, it's piled high with marinated tomatoes, cucumbers, kalamata olives, red onions & delicious feta cheese with vinaigrette dressing, all on top of a thick crusty bread, that's always served warm right from the oven.  The service is fast and efficient, even when crowded, but you are never rushed and everyone is very friendly.  I would highly recommend Crust for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"I live nearby, and thoroughly enjoy Crust as my local pizza spot. The people are always nice, and usually, waits are minimal to non-existent. The New York Rustica is my fave, though most everything I've tried has been worth it!"}
{"text":"Fresh, Fast, and Good!  Simple done with perfection!  Pizza is the best in town.  But why stop there, their salads, sandwiches, and pastas are all homemade and yummy!"}
{"text":"Fantastic freshly prepared pizza from the Wood fire oven served by enthusiastic chefs and servers.   Also great atmosphere for games to watch."}
{"text":"First time here, after driving by it for years. VERY glad we came for lunch. Had Mama's Meatball with linguini for the main course and shared a small caesar and calamari for starters. Quality of the food was excellent, the portions were huge, had to take home over half the entree. Jay our server was professional and did a great job of making sure we were well taken care of. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and offered suggestions. Atmosphere was nice and the place was very clean. It is my new neighborhood Italian place!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, cozy environment. Service needs improvement and the staff needs to greet and say goodbye to customers. Overall, food good but service is mediocre."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Cleveland! The hand tossed crust is soft and crunchy at the same time, with a hint of sea salt. I always get the fennel Italian salami one and although I really want to try another combination, I don't because it is always so good! Mike always remembers me and thanks me as if I gave him a vintage Mercedes. The best customer service anywhere along with the best truly homemade pizza for a very reasonable price. Mike had a great patio installed out front with an eclectic combination of paving stones and marble. It's a beautiful place to enjoy Crust!"}
{"text":"I went to Crust in the late afternoon on Father's Day. The new seating layout allows for more people in the restaurant, great idea! I have (on several different occasions, not all at once!) had the bruschetta appetizer (yum!), Greek salad, original Rustica, a Greek pizza (mozzarella, feta, green and black olives), cannolis and meatballs. Sunday I had another fav, the Filet Mignon Sliders!! So tender, perfectly cooked and sliced, the best ever! My boss said he goes there, surprised I haven't ruin into him yet....anyway, we both gave discriminating tastes and Crust is always on my go-to list! I also have the Crust card and receive text messages which is great for finding out about specials when making spontaneous plans! Love the friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Slow service, very small pour for overpriced wine.love the rustica pizza. i like to carry out garlic knots and a rustica from their tatum location. for some reason no garlic knots at the location on indian bend."}
{"text":"Devan was an excellent server. The thin crust rustics was fabulous. We will be back to enjoy lovely dinner."}
{"text":"We had a slight issue with Crust today and when it was brought to their attention and they went out of their way to make it right! Love the food and the group working there! They are awesome and always such a joy! Food was Awesome!!! Will always continue to go back for great food!!!"}
{"text":"This establishment has really changed over the years.  Been a dedicated diner for many, many years but our last two visits have been pretty bad.  First a couple of weeks ago they forgot the crust salad with our order (to go).  I called immediately when I got home - the order was even  reviewed with me at the bar.  Natalie was quick to apologize when I called and added a credit to my account for next time. Good customer service. How could someone pick up a pasta dish and say the salad is in there?  Very strange.    Tonight was an example of a restaurant cutting back to save a couple of bucks.   My son's order (which he has ordered in the past) - broccoli, chicken over penne with olive oil.  There wasn't even enough chicken to equal a half of one small chicken breast.  No flavor either.  The crust salad ordered had 4 pathetic pieces of cucumber and two slices of a roma tomato. The bread bowl was stale, tough and appeared to have been made several days ago.  Grandma's Pasta was good as usual.  Now I'm a chef and was trying not to be critical but this meal was bad.  I have lots of family coming in to town over the holidays; however my usual dinner night at Crust is out!   I have promoted Crust to everyone I know but will no longer recommend.  Sorry guys - I'll miss you!"}
{"text":"So I'm at work today and can't leave because...well I'm the only one who doesn't have vacation time. I just received 3 flyers in the mail from CRUST, they are right down the road from my office ...sweet!!!! I look over the menu and love almost everything on it. Decide to order a few things for delivery (they have a $20 minimum). I call and ask to order they proceed to tell me because they are slammed the delivery terms have changed to a $30 minimum. Really. Very very disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped off for dinner with our kids.  I was immediately impressed that they served Peroni on tap.  We ordered the Arugula and Prosciutto pizza and I have to say that it is one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten!  I had the manager come to our table and told him how in love I was, and at the end of our meal he brought us a fabulous cannoli desert.  We took a bottle of their house Pinot Noir that was equally impressive.  Hands down, if you are in town you MUST eat here."}
{"text":"Really mediocre bland pizza.  Overly thick crust for wood-fired.  Every ingredient, from crust to cheese to toppings to sauce was lackluster and flavorless. On plus side it is clean and decorated in an inoffensive modern manner.  Recommend against. Go to Pomo nearby instead."}
{"text":"Everything at Crust is fantastic - the food, the service, the atmosphere. My fave is the Spaghetti and Meatball rustica - it's not on the menu anymore but they'll make it if you ask for it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The reviews are right this crust is soggy. If you have 35-40 additional minutes to wait I suggest requesting it extra well done. Our server was nice and considerate his manager on the other hand is the reason my would be 4 stars went down to 1. The hubby and I have been here a few times but after last night I probably will not be back. The manager is cheap, combative, and overcharged our bill. When we addressed him on the bill he was not too kind and even though he was combative he said he did not want to \"banter\" with me. He fixed the bill by overcharging it even more by $10. The poor server was left to clean up his manager's mess. Hey crust don't offer specials if you are not going to honor them."}
{"text":"Was in Scottsdale last night found this quaint wood burning pizza place. The food was amazing and the staff very friendly.  Mitch the manager/co-owner personally came to check on us and make sure we had a great experience. ..which we did! We will be back."}
{"text":"At one time we would have given Crust 4 stars at least, but the last few times we have been there we have been disappointed. On one occasion the pizza wasn't done cooking and on the second they threw it in the box while it was too hot and we ended up with cheese only on 1/2 the pizza from the cheese all sliding and firming on that 1/2.   Prior to these experiences, we always loved the pizza at Crust and I am sure we will give it another chance in the future, but at the moment we are disappointed."}
{"text":"Crust is our favorite restaurant in the Phoenix metro area! My husband and I eat there at least once a week. The food is super tasty and very reasonably priced. They have a great wine selection. If you join (for free) their VIP club, you get weekly texts notifying you of specials. And they give you a VIP club card, and you earn money on it for every dollar you spend. Recently, we had a whole evening at Crust just off the money on our  VIP card. Did I mention the VIP club is FREE?!! Also, we want to give a shout out to our favorite waitress, Jordan, who is always super friendly and gives us super great service! :)"}
{"text":"No customer service. Just had Grub Hub deliver a pizza that took 2 hours and was cold. Called Crust and spoke with the manager. He couldn't do anything because Grub Hub did the delivery. Really? You can't bring me a hot pizza? Just oh well enjoy your cold pizza tonight! Thanks manager guy enjoy your cold review."}
{"text":"First time here and It was awesome.  The service is amazing from the beginning to end.  Our waitress was friendly and happy.  After ordering we received a follow up from another person to see how we were doing.  I ordered the little John and my colleagues had pasta with shrimp.  We also shared a caesar salad to start off our meal.  I will definitely be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"So having lived in Arizona for quite sometime in my very recent past......i can overlook the strip mall exterior.  The key to success in these parts is whether or not the restaurant can make you forget you are in a strip mall once you are inside.  It has a great cafe feel, with the community style seating. It feels warm and cozy, with the wood fire burning stove cooking up pizza as the focal point.  The wine list is diverse, although I am not positive my server knew the definition of a dry wine, but eeh.......he was young and I'm no sommelier.  My friend and i were able to split a pasta dish and selected our own half order of salad, this was a healthy serving of food.   It is reasonably priced and the ingredients are fresh.  It's a strong menu with equally healthy and not so healthy options.   I was a little put off by the rush from our server to get me to sign my tab, but not a huge rush for him to take our order........Menu's closed....take my order, wine still in the glass.........leave my tab alone.  Despite that little annoyance, i enjoyed it and recommend it."}
{"text":"I love the new Crust.  It is just as delicious as Tremont and is closer to my office.  It is great that they have a lot of seating so you get to enjoy the sigts and smells of the awesome food.  They have reworked the logistics so the line goes much quicker now than when they first opened.  Best pizza, gnocchi and subs in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I love this place. If there's a higher quality pizza in cleveland, I haven't found it yet. The freshness of all the ingredients shine though no matter what toppings you choose. Or if you go with one of their specials, the chorizo pizza is absolutely fantastic. Spicy chorizo and tangy goat cheese with roasted peppers...winning combination. I've lived in tremont for years and until crust opened I was strictly Edison's when it came to pizza...and I haven't been there since. Not because Edison's is bad, but because crust is that good."}
{"text":"I've been to Crust twice and though the food was very good both times, our server last Thursday was snippy.  Granted, we ended up having 7 people in our lunch party and the restaurant was busy--we should have called ahead perhaps. However, it was one of those last minute things.   I ended up coming in about  20 minutes before the other six people in my party.  So they did have notice.  I sat down at a large table...it's seat yourself...and it took a little time before the server (or anyone) approached me.  Neither the server nor the grey-haired man behind the bar (the manager?) was at all welcoming.  They rounded up a couple more chairs.  I wasn't given a menu or asked if I wanted something to drink.  Eventually (10 minutes later), the server asked me if I wanted something to drink while I waited for the rest of the group.  I ordered iced tea and asked for a menu. In this economy, they should have been thrilled with a group of 7 no matter how busy they were. At any rate, the food was excellent.  So good that I took my sister back there today.  Today our server, Jaquin, was just wonderful.  He was helpful, prompt, and very pleasant.  I had the Bella Rosa rustica pizza last Thursday and today I had the God Daughter.  My sister had the eggplant, garlic, and basil pizza.  We both had Caesar salad.  All of the food was exceptionally fresh and flavorful.  It was sooooo yummy that this may be my new favorite place for a casual meal.  My sister and I raved about the place later to friends who will be going soon.  I'm giving Crust 5 stars because it is  an excellent place with really good food and it is NOT (thank heavens) a chain!  It is locally owned, I believe, and I hope that you will give Crust a try.  Ask for Jaquin to be your server!"}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good.   However, when the gal took our order, we ordered two slices of cheese pizza. 15 minutes later after we ordered and sat down, they brought out two pieces of pepperoni, forcing us to wait another 5 or more minutes for our actual order.   This isn't my first choice in pizza in the city. The service wasn't best, and I felt like the employees were annoyed that we even placed an order with them in the first place. Maybe if the attitudes were better, we'd go back for a second visit."}
{"text":"Outstanding wood fired, hand tossed pizza.  Fresh brushetta, locally sourced produce. Attentive service. Family oriented. Loved it. Family recipes.  Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"UPDATE: manager took care of all of our issues.  I would go back.  Especially because they support the \"first things first\" foundation.  I support Kurt warner as well and have played in his game for the last three years.  I love that crust sponsors the meals."}
{"text":"Crust used to be my favorite place to get an awesome slice for $3, but they decided to blast the price up by 50%. Not cool. Maybe 50 cents at a time or something but a $1.50 increase is preposterous. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Big fan of Crust Pizza. Good food, good happy hour, good prices. We eat there regularly and also get delivery. The managers go out of their way to make sure you are completely satisfied as a guest. We had one to go order that was wrong once and they corrected it, let us keep the food that we got by mistake and added money to our loyalty card."}
{"text":"Boring crust, overly sweet sauce, tasteless, unmelted cheese, overall boring food. In my Humble opinion, this Pie is not worth repeating."}
{"text":"I told my friend that I'd rather eat out of a vending machine, and he said.. \"Yelp THAT!\"   I had the calamari app, the caprese salad and the eggplant rolotini.  The salad was served in what i can only describe as a burnt, upside-down bread \"hat\" that was inedible and in the way.  The rolotini was a hot pocket, only dry and crappy.  Boo on you, Crust!"}
{"text":"An absolutely awesome little spot tucked away in a stripmall which proves that great food can found in the most unassuming of locations!  The pizzas are outstanding, most notably the thin crust pies. The sauces are beautifully balanced, the cheeses properly dispersed and the salumis perfectly crisp and juicy. Along with a nice red you cannot go wrong.  Our server was also one of the owners and he was incredibly helpful and friendly. I left feeling like we were long lost friends, and I felt like my dollar and patronage really mattered.   Find this place and you will find a great dining experience. And eventhough it's small, they take kindly to kids, which us a bonus when my son and I have pizza night."}
{"text":"Just ordered the destoyer, which is their 32\" pizza for a group of 5 and I must say it was absolutely delicious. You can tell the sauce is homemade and can taste each individual herb they use. Im only giving 4 stars because I have yet to try anything else but once I do Im sure Ill update and give it 5 stars."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza around.  Can't say anything about the subs because I haven't tried them yet but they look amazing.  I give only 4/5 stars because of one experience when the pizza wasn't as good as a few other times we have been here.  However, I'm sure this was just a growing pain.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The pizza was great- so good that we suffered through incredibly slow service multiple times -including being put on hold for over 10 minutes and finally giving up to drive to the restaurant to have the server shrug his shoulders about the long wait time and blame it on \"a lot of calls coming through.\" Uh- ok... Every other popular place I've been manages to pick up the phone- kind of defeats the purpose of a call in number. Again- pizza is great so we sucked it up but it was a frustrating experience."}
{"text":"I had a plain pizza and a chorizo/goat cheese pizza over the last week. Strengths: the dough and crust was chewy and had flavor, and the toppings are fresh. Weaknesses: way undersauced, and way too much cheese (I'm afraid to see what an extra cheese pizza looks like, given the amount they use on a regular pie). Because of the amount of cheese they use, the pizza was extremely greasy with pools of oil."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious and should be the focus of your order. We ordered a Penne dish and it was fair. Definitely worth it if you have an itch for great pizza. We picked up our order as I like to see the kitchen of new places I frequent and was received by nice staff who offered a little extra seasoning for free. Nestled in a quaint part of town, they also have a few tables outside for star gazing. Would definitely recommend Crust for pizza."}
{"text":"This is my first yelp review- EVER.  I think that speaks to just how wonderful my experience was at Crust last night.  My girlfriends and I ordered the Copocollo pizza- it was AMAZING.  Everything from the crust to the toppings was perfect including the service.  The owner was there when we picked up our pizza and you could tell that he was truly excited for us to get to experience his \"baby\".  His passion for the ingredients was evident and he wasn't shy about guiding us through the menu.  If possible, he got me even more excited to eat the pizza than I was when I ordered it.    The three of us also split the Park salad.  It was a great addition to our meal and easily could have fed a couple others.   Can't wait to go back to Crust!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Warm family feel and wonderful attentive staff. I asked for a custom cocktail and was told \"no problem\". Great job!"}
{"text":"Made it back to try a slice of pizza.  The servers were not very helpful and actually a bit rude.  The pizza was good, but nothing special.  Done with this place."}
{"text":"Cleveland has outdone itself once again. I'm beginning to not miss NY pizza (well, that's an exaggeration, I admit...). Crust may not have the biggest slice (I think Sweet Basil has that covered), but it has the BEST.  Long, crisp, and thick, Crust's slice is so heavenly. I LOVED the...wait for it...crust. Even the top part of the crust, which I usually either leave over and throw in the box (we used to call these scraps \"the bones\" growing up), or reluctantly chew, bored out of my mind. This crust was chewy, soft, a bit salty, and all around amazing.  The sauce and cheese were great too.  I enjoyed how the pies were just situated at the top of the counter, and how they were heated individually when ordered (this is how it should be done; I'd rather not have the pizza sitting under a heat lamp for hours, thank you very much). I thought the triangular \"cutting board\" the pizza sat on was kind of cute, if not a bit awkward. I used my fork & knife for half of the slice, then tore through the rest with my hands.  The outdoor seating was nice. I am assuming that this place gets really crowded at night, but for a Saturday lunch, everything was perfect."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!  Not only is the pizza wonderful but their pasta is devine! I love that this is a small shop- I think it helps make the food that much better!  This is a Tremont Must Try!!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best lunch place for people in Midtown. The owner, Mike is so dedicated to this place and this business and it shows in every item that is prepared. The prices are beyond reasonable for the portions and they bake fresh dough daily. You can tell. Everyone is so friendly here, it's a place where other customers will engage with you if you look open to it, which I think is great. The combination of the quality menu items and the friendliness of the employees makes this my favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"I like this spot. You can tell they take a lot of pride in the food. We had a nice lady (Who must have been one of the owners) bring out our food to is and was so friendly. I also love that they bring out half of the pizza and then leave the other half in the oven to keep it warm. Brilliant idea- I can't believe more places don't do this. I started out writing this as a 4 star review but have convinced myself that it's a 5 star review while writing!"}
{"text":"It's a small neighborhood place that you could easily drive by. Come here when you are hungry. The slices are about a foot long. This is the closet thing I found to NY Pizza since I moved here from Long Island, NY. I ate 2 huge slices with pepperoni and extra cheese. So painfully full.  I'm am glad to hear that they are opening a larger place on Professor Ave in Tremont. I can't wait to try their other food."}
{"text":"I love.. love... loove this place. Everything is home-made and you can taste it. Best Pizza in Cleveland"}
{"text":"Not impressed. It started with the Sangria. Bitter. In the middle was the bruschetta. Wet. At the end, the tortellini. A hair. Great service. Therefore, made no complaints."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a few times and yesterday ordered take out.  Food was perfect and service has been great and quick every time!"}
{"text":"Second time here, first visit was slightly better than the second but good both times nonetheless.  Family and I came to have a few bites and for some of us to head upstairs to check out there cool store / bookstore afterwards.  As usual, we shared a bunch of appetizers and two custom pizzas.  I had a delicious Porter beer they had on tap (peanut butter flavored), and my wife enjoyed here selection as well.  For appetizers, we split an order of house rosemary fries and the fried pepperoni mozzarella bites.  The fries were hand cut and served with mayo, which paired perfectly with the pungent herbed fries.  The bites were small (only three in an order) but the girls loved them with the bright marinara to dip in.  The table also split a side salad with Italian dressing that made us feel at least a little bit healthy. ;-)  As for the pies, we settled on two of their specialties...the ham and eggs (which we'd had before and rally liked) and the Spanish chorizo.  The ham and eggs could be a rock star go-to pizza for early mornings, with its sunnyside up eggs, capacollo ham and caramelized onions.  The Spanish chorizo was a bit spicier and mixed well with the roasted red peppers and goat cheese on top.  Both pies had a nicely chewy (but crisp outer shell)  crust to them.  Actually, the real reason we came here was for daughter #1 to experience their divine creme brulee, but alas they are no longer serving desserts (as they apparently did not sell very well and were dropped from the menu).  Overall, this is a solid spot for some pizza, a cold brew and a chill place to hang out.  I know we'll be back again."}
{"text":"It has been a number of months since I have been here. My niece shared that she had a poor experience several weeks ago and I read a few poor reviews on Yelp before going there today. The service was a bit slow however the server and manager were friendly. The food was exceptional as always. My suggestion is to give yourself plenty of time and relax - the food is worth it IMHO!"}
{"text":"I'd give Crust 3.75 stars. I really like their Spanish chorizo pizza. I've had it twice: dine in and carry out. I really hate the butt fuckery of parking there though, which is a big drawback for me."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. The happy hour needs to be a little \"happier\"; $14-$18 happy hour apps are way too pricey for a \"happy hour\". If the happy hour is only for two hours at least make it worth it for the customers to come in; most of the happy hour appetizers are more expensive than the entrées. I have been a loyal customer since day one and that will not change since the food is that spectacular however I would like to see the happy hour menu go back to the happy hour prices when Crust first opened.  The food kicks ass, the service kicks ass, and pretty much everything kicks ass about Crust. Regardless,try it."}
{"text":"Delicious, reasonably priced food with the kindest, friendliest workers around. As Shakespeare said, \"Get thee to a pizzeria.\" Just make sure that the pizzeria is CRUST. You will not be disappointed in the menu, pricing, or SERVICE."}
{"text":"Crust is generally a great place, but lunch was a disaster. They were severely understaffed and our lunch took over an hour. While the restaurant was busy, this is a crazy amount of time for lunch. Our drinks were never refilled, it took 35 minutes to get our pizza, and was impossible to get or check.  My pizza was over cooked slightly.  Overall, it's generally a nice place to go, but I would never come back for lunch, unless I had 2 hours to waste."}
{"text":"Very Good and will defiantly be back for more!  I walked in one day for lunch expecting a hole in the wall pizza place since I heard they served pizza by the slice, I was very surprised.  Very elegant!    I proceeded to sit at the bar area since I was alone and just wanted a fast meal.  Right away I have someone taking my drink order.  I ordered the Bella Rossa Rustica pizza, which is their individual pizza.  This pizza was as good as it gets and very healthy.  Starts with a whole wheat crust followed with a vegetable pesto topped off with basil and mozzarella.  The blend was amazing.  The pizza was large enough to feed two people so I ended up taking half of it back to my office for later, just did not last very long. The service was great, the food was great and good atmosphere.  I will defiantly be back for lunch and will be recommending it for my next team lunch."}
{"text":"Ready for today's introduction by way of tortured metaphor?  Crust is a pretty good restaurant that seems to be struggling with it's signature.  Is it the fine, loopy John Hancock of the hand-stretched Rustica?  The decorative and celebratory graffiti tag of a slice of New York style thin-crust?  The fun scribble of a salad served in a bread boule - described as \"Crusted!\" by the menu?  As far as I'm concerned, the ambiguity doesn't really matter.  We indulged in a little more here than we normally do at a restaurant, thanks to a super-awesome coupon.  Here's what we had:  A Tuscan salad of some sort, spinach-based in the aforementioned boule - crisp and tasty, not drenched in sauce.  The bread boule was definitely a nice touch.  The house-made croutons were fresh and delicious.  The artichoke dip was pretty standard fare - tons of cheese, with spinach and artichokes baked in, served with the aforementioned croutons and some not-so-fresh tasting tortilla chips.  Solid.  The pizzas - we got two Rusticas to split.  These occupied awkward territory, portion-wise.  Each was probably a a bit too big for most person to finish alone, yet too small to bring home a satisfying follow-up leftover party - definitely too small for two to share.  Still, for $8.50, you definitely get a satisfying penisesque-pie.  We ordered the one with pesto, which I was nervous about - a lot of restaurants serve their pesto pizza drenched in the oil-y goodness, but this was instead served with a tasteful red pesto sauce that hit all the right notes.  The other pie was a little more forgettable, but still solid.  My one knock on this restaurant - and why I would give it a 3.5, instead of a 4 - is the namesake - the crust.  The crust at the end of each piece was charred and hard.  Not crunchy, like a well-done wood-roasted pizza, like the pies at Cibo and Pizzeria Bianco, but straight up hard.  Still, in light of the affordability, tastiness, and nice, relaxed atmosphere, this place leans more towards 4 than 3."}
{"text":"i feel compelled to write this review because the pizza here is so delicious.  the crust is ridiculously good - they put a little sea salt on the crust edge and give you some marinara to dip.  the pieces are HUGE.  and i almost fell out of my seat when i saw they only charge $3.00 for a cheese slice.  WHAT????  $3.00 for the best pizza in CLE????  amazing cheese, amazing sauce and the guys behind the counter were so nice.  i just wish this place was in chagrin instead of tremont."}
{"text":"I work in Tremont, but live in South Euclid. There are plenty of good pizza places near my house that would allow me to get a warmer dinner home. None of the pizza places near me hold a candle to Crust Pizza, though. I've gone out of my way several times to have Crust for dinner (even on days I don't work). It's in my top 5 pizzas I've EVER had."}
{"text":"Meatball sliders are a must! And don't forget jar of sauce to take home! Absolutely delicious"}
{"text":"I am visiting from So Cal. This place is awesome. Good wine, good food. Meat and cheese platter is huge for $14. And the pizza is freshly made right in front of you. I am so happy I am staying within walking distance. Def coming here every night till I leave lol.  Dustin is amazing at making those pizzas and Shawn is a great bartender. Since I am visiting he gave me good tips."}
{"text":"BOMB! The garlic rolls are amazinggg !! Especially if you like spice. Reasonably priced and all the food is good."}
{"text":"I love the cool local shops in Tremont. This place was cool, small, and very local. The food was pretty good but the pizza was a bit disappointing. Service was fast and friendly. These slices were incredibly large and one piece will most likely fill you up."}
{"text":"Crust's new location opened recently (now on the main drag as opposed to a side street) and they've made some major improvements. Some new appetizers adorn the menu, and they have a full bar. Their pizza selection is the same as it's always been; interesting uses of goat cheese, truffle oil, and other non-standard toppings.  Their seating is greatly improved, too--place comfortably seats about 50 not including the bar.  It's just as good as Edison's, but for different reasons. You are doing yourself a disservice by not coming here."}
{"text":"The staff was awesome! Helpful on the phone when I put in my to go order and they were fun to laugh and joke with when I picked my food up!   My favorite is the lunch special pizza deal- they have good pizza, but this time I ordered the Mac and cheese and it was only ok. I got chicken on top which was really good but I'll probably stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"Don't really write reviews but felt this was appropriate.   Read good reviews on yelp and decided to check it out. Came in late Friday night for some dinner. Looks like a strip mall but inside is cozy. We ordered salad and pizza. Service was prompt and helpful. The salad was huge but yummy. Apparently there was an issue with the pizza in the kitchen so the waiter brought out two apps and a smaller pizza without even asking! Pretty awesome. It ended up being so much food we had to box the big pizza and half the apps. While the prices were a bit step, the staff obviously cares about the experience. Going back."}
{"text":"Come on Crust... Stop skimping on the toppings.  At $3.50 apiece, our large pizza barely had any slab bacon on it.  And only 4 eggs.  Plenty of sausage and bacon though."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I've had in AZ. Great service and Peroni on tap.  Can't ask for much more. Look forward to dining here many more times."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here with some friends and family last Saturday night and it was really good.  The eggplant parmesan was good, but two of us could have split it.  They serve it on top of a big pizza crust, so it is very filling.  My son had the God Mother pizza which had bacon, pesto and fresh mozzarella.  The pizza was in the shape of a guitar.  He liked it, but wasn't thrilled with the bacon.  It would have probably been better with just the two main ingredients.  The restaurant is casual and hip at the same time."}
{"text":"Very good food, warm atmosphere. Need a better beer selection however."}
{"text":"It is with true sadness that I must note that tonight marks the end of an era for us.  Crust had been our go-to pizza place for longer than I can remember.  We easily spent $100+ per week at this location, not to mention attending wine dinners for an added cost.  The pizza was consistently good and the selection of Italian red wines was decent despite the fact that our beloved Barbera was recently removed from the list.    We arrived tonight at 8:30pm after rushing to get home from our respective long days at the office so that we would be sure to arrive a full 30 minutes before Crust's posted closing time of 9:00pm so as to avoid inconveniencing the staff by arriving too close to closing time.  We'd been looking forward to our usual Greek salad, 20\" pizza which also would provide us with tomorrow's lunch, and our half-off bottle of wine consistent with their posted special on Mondays of 50% off bottles of wine.  Unfortunately for us, particularly given that this is not an overly convenient location relative to our home, we were immediately greeted by the female manager who announced that they were already closed because it was \"really slow\" (the pizza oven was already shut down) and that the kitchen staff had already gone home.  Really?!?!?!? It never ceases to amaze me how many businesses fail to realize that 90% of the challenge is getting a customer in the door in the first place and that it is regular customers who continually generate revenue that are the key to keeping the doors open.  Is it too much to ask that a business actually honor their posted business hours when regular customers make the decision to expend effort driving to your establishment to spend their money???  If a restaurant doesn't wish to be open unless some threshold level of business is being generated then why not simply post a sign that says \"we're open as long as we're busy but don't rely on us to respect our regular customers enough to care if they're going out of their way to purchase our food during the period of time we've said we'll be open\"?  I refuse to \"beg\" a restaurant to allow us to spend our money there.  Are we supposed to call before driving over during their normal business hours to find out if they are, in fact, going to extend us the privilege of being open and allowing customers to dine?  Sorry, that's more effort than we're willing to expend to patronize a business that can't even honor their posted hours, particularly on a night when they offer a special that is designed to bring customers in (see my review of Vito's Pizza & Italian Restaurant from July 2012 and I can definitively say that we have not been back there despite how convenient their location was for us).  Sadly, tonight's attempt at dining at Crust will be our last and we will find somewhere else to spend our hard-earned dollars that actually appreciates its customers' patronage."}
{"text":"I hadn't been into Crust for a couple of months until last week. When I went in last week I was disappointed that they seemed to have new management. The place didn't have the same ambiance it used to have. Tonight when I went in though the same manager I used to see was in there. I think her name is Tammie. The place had the same welcoming vibe and the food was great. We will be coming back again and were very happy to see they hadn't changed management after all."}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I stumbled across Crust on one girls night while looking for a great place close by to get some food.  We were very pleasantly surprised - this place is very cute and the food is awesome.  The spinach and artichoke dip is to die for, I had the steak sandwich, and my friend had the pizza with pasta on top of it - both were so so so good!!!  Pretty reasonably priced and the food and wine is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here with a party of 10. We made reservations and ended up being late, but they were very nice when I called and held our table. Everyone enjoyed the food and the dessert pizza. $5 sangria is awesome!"}
{"text":"We started off with the meat and cheese board for an appetizer. A great value for $13. For our entrees we ordered the caprese salad in a whole wheat bread bowl, the chicken Caesar salad in an Italian bread bowl and the kids split the Penne alla Vodka. Everything was delicious, although the portions seemed a bit smaller from our previous visit. The place was empty. We were the only table of patrons along with a few people sitting at the bar, but our service was exceptional. Would like to try their pizza next time.   We were talking to the manager about the new location coming to downtown Chandler next spring. It will be a two story restaurant with a \"speak easy\" lower level. Sounds pretty sweet!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place would be a 5 star joint if the appearance and the airborne particles to food were taken into account. Besides those two annoyances, it's a small pizza shop where pickup is more convenient versus seating. The food, particularly the pizza, and subs are phenomenal. I've had the margarita pizza, and the Italian hoagie hot and they were so filling. I barely finished my sub and I'm a huge eater. And for 9$ it's worth the prime ingredients. I'd recommend this place as long as you aren't turned off by their single sliced pizzas sitting on the counter. The food solely by itself makes this place. The customer service was great too and friendly."}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place 5 stars, but couldn't because they have no beers on tap, and a very limited selection of bottled beers.  However, this is a great little neighborhood pizza joint.  The staff was friendly and attentive, and the open kitchen with it's large brick oven adds a nice touch to the dining room.   I had the Pepperoni and Ham Rollatini, and it was delicious. The meat inside was perfectly balanced with the cheese, and the crust had a crispness that you can only get from a brick oven.  Everything at Crust was great and I'm sure I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place forever and always forget about it. Finally gave it a shot and was a little let down.  I got a Caesar salad for $7.95 and more than half of the lettuce was brown.   My pizza was boxed up and ready to go when I got there. When I got home, the pizza seem extremely doughy and undercooked   So I'm at home with my pizza in the oven.   On the plus side the staff was very helpful and polite."}
{"text":"Craving pizza, saw all the great reviews on this place and decided to give it a try for lunch.  I ordered the rustics Little Nicky and my coworker ordered the 2 slice lunch special with tomato and mushroom.  Both pizzas were pretty good and well priced for lunch.  Good service and fast turnaround on the order.  I would go back but would try something else."}
{"text":"We went back to give Crust another try (due to extenuating circumstances our last visit deserved a second chance).  LOVED the food, GREAT service, and very fun ambiance!!!  Thank you Ryan (one of the owners) for showing what your restaurant is all about!!!  :-)"}
{"text":"One of the best Cleveland Pizza options.  Good thing they don't delivery or I would be ordering multiple times a week.  Some great options for toppings and some amazing hand tossed crust!"}
{"text":"Amazing Pizza, salads, sandwiches, vegan burger. This is by far the best pizza place in Cleveland. Everything is fresh made from scratch and absolutely delicious. The recent addition to the menu of the vegan burger is my favorite item. They also have mozzarella balls that are absolutely incredible. Their pasta is fresh and tasty. They are crossed is soft Chris be an absolutely perfect."}
{"text":"This is by far THE best! I lived in Tremont for nearly two years, and I never had a bad tasting pizza or piece of tiramisu! Don't limit yourself to pizza! Try anything and everything on the menu! The staff is so friendly, and now, living in Kentucky, I can't find anything like Crust!!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't stay away; truly love this place!  Today I ordered for take out; tried the bruschetta board sampling the apple and fig, cucumber and feta, Italian antipasto, and the artichoke and mushroom.  First, it was soooo beautifully presented (even in the take out container!) and it was HUGE!  All for only $10?!  I couldn't believe it.  Then we had the marinara pasta with penne noodles and meatballs; best meatballs I've had in a long time!  Finally, we tried the Linguini Toscana; also super delicious!  I just can't say enough how much I love this place!!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! We had the best sausage pizza. The sausage was amazing and of course the crust was the best. The employees were the friendliest and most accommodating I have ever encountered in a restaurant. Wish more establishments were like this. Love, Love, Love Crust Pizza AND their staff."}
{"text":"Follow up:   The manager Kate immediately got ahold of me and offered a complimentary meal to remedy their error. I have to say that I was very glad to accept. My fiancée and I shared the calamari and arugula rustica. It was AMAZING!! Our waiter was also extremely helpful and friendly; Crust went over and above to make our meal great. I will definitely give them another chance on Uber Eats. I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant, food excellent.  Whole Wheat Pizza dough is a must, Grandma's pizza was excellent. Greek Salad was served in a bread bowl--Excellent!   Waiter and Waiter Assistants outstanding.   Did not care for the booth being so close to the door, as the cold air was not pleasant to deal with during dinner.   Will definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"What a awesome place!! Being from Philadelphia PA.. it has been hard to find great pizza.. we ate lunch in between hockey games and it was perfect!! Works were fabulous!! Even saved a Boston Terrier from getting lost"}
{"text":"Came for the #greatrusticarace and found a great neighborhood pizza hangout. Awesome pizza, fair price, amazing staff. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great Find...This hidden gem is worth finding. Excellent wine selection along with a complete bar, compliment the excellent food. We have enjoys their individual pizzas on previous visits, but, this time we decided to try their 20\" round thin crust pizza. Although it's called thin crust, it is more N.Y. Style to me. After enjoying a house salad served in a pizza crust bowl, our pizza arrived. It is served on a wooden plank, hot and fresh from their open pizza oven. They bring you just half at a time, keeping the other half warm. The half pizza is four large slices. Their sauce is excellent. Nice cheese and your choice of toppings. After you finish they ask if you would like the other half, or, wrapped up to take home. We were all so full, we took the other half home for lunch the next day. Their prices are great, so a 20\" pizza with two toppings for $20.00 is an excellent value for excellent pizza. Well worth the stop here."}
{"text":"I ordered the Caesar Salad and Penne alla Vodka pasta via Uber Eats delivery. The food was fine, but just doesn't quite measure-up to Uncle Sal's Italian Restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food at a great price!!!! Ingredients are always fresh and delicious! Happy hour it a good deal with half price appetizers! The spinach dip is to die for! Superbly executed with brick oven pizza bakers tossing you pizza right behind the bar. Fun for a date or a group! Private parties would be ideal here!"}
{"text":"Love this place.... Just minutes from my office and it's one of the best pizza spots in the city. They offer \"by the slice \" and have a ton of toppings to choose from..... BTW.... The slices are huge.  My usual go to is a slice of pepperoni and fresh mozzarella."}
{"text":"Oh my lord! Delicious and such a good deal.  I ordered the Penne pasta mushroom Parmesan cream sauce with truffle oil and it was AMAZING. The cream sauce was delicious and it had hints of rosemary in it I believe. it was a much larger portion than I expected. DEFINITELY a great price.  In terms of the giant one slice I ordered, it is amazing. I love NY style pizza and this is delicious. The crust is crispy but not too crispy. The sauce is amazing and I generally don't like red sauce.   This is a solid 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I have been to crust at least a half a dozen times and, normally, I really enjoy this place. I have even introduced friends to the food and they have returned. After what happened a few weeks ago I will not be returning. We had ordered apps, salads, and entrees and while we were waiting for our first course my sister took my 2 year old nephew out front to play because he was restless. Only a few minutes after we had ordered he fell while playing and hit his head hard against the ground. I stopped my server and asked him to cancel our order but charge me for what had been made and I'd take it to go. I made it clear my nephew had seriously injured himself and we were running to the hospital. Less than half the food was ready and bagged up but I was charged for all of it. I didn't realize it until later when we had left the hospital. I called them a few days later to explain that I was displeased. We had HAD to leave,  I told them, because a toddler needed to be rushed to the hospital immediately. I explained I offered to pay for what was ready but was charged for all of it; even the stuff I didn't receive. The manager lacked any sort of empathy and coldly offered a $20 credit for the future. Our meal was close to three times that much (we had also ordered drinks that we never drank). In my opinion they should have been apologetic for overcharging me especially under the circumstances. I'll admit the food is good but the integrity of both individuals I dealt with is nonexistent. Also, although children are allowed, this is obviously not a family friendly establishment."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC !! We just walked here because it was close to our hotel / resort. But wow, what a great surprise ! This place exceeded all expectations: a great bar with a super bartender who created a cocktail on request, delicious food (the lasagne is really, really good) and great service. Our waiter, Tim, was fantastic and fun to share our meal with - he also made great food recommendations. The kids loved the pizzas, the adults loved the food & wine, and all the desserts were delicious. This is NOT just another pizza joint ... It's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"My Scottsdale pitstop while on business travel. They have a spacious bar to sit at while watching your pizza goodness being made. Being hot in AZ, you must start with their Tuscan salad. It is an amazing mix of greens and protein. I would love to recreate it at home. Their pizza slice portions are very generous. The sauce has sweet but a little spicy kick. Nothing crazy hot at all. If you are a business traveler, stop by this local spot. The staff has always been super welcoming which is an added bonus to the food."}
{"text":"Everything here was just fine.  Nothing special.  The food was OK.  Both my fiance and I expected better.   I had a pizza with chicken & bacon...it sounds much better than it is while I'm writing. We also had filet mignon sliders.  Again, sounds better than it is.   Same with the cannoli.  The layout is a bit odd.  Some tables are high-tops & some are low to the ground.  All the tables are really close together, so if it's busy, this becomes not that private of an experience.  All that being said, the service was good.  Everyone was nice enough, and it's not like anything was terrible.  We likely won't return, but hey, it could have been an off-night."}
{"text":"Incredible pizza!  Nice friendly people working behind the counter.  We are from out of state.  We found this place on yelp, and I'm so glad we did.  It was worth driving out of our way to have dinner here."}
{"text":"Great pizza. They are happy to do substitutions on their gourmet pizzas. Pasta and salad very good. Reasonable, salad $5, pasta $8, and 16\" pizzas $13 or $18 for the gourmet which have several different toppings. We had the hand tossed, and they offer thin crust as well. Service excellant, very courteous."}
{"text":"Went here with my dad for lunch...only one other person in the restaurant at the time. We ordered an app that came put pretty quickly. Slowly, more people came in....I saw several walk out after not getting their orders taken. I had ordered a sandwich and he ordered mac and cheese. 30-40 mins later we got our food. I understand that the restaurant was changed around, but don't just have one waiter for lunch rush. I had to scarf down my food and miss a meeting that I should have been able to make with an hour long lunch.  Plus was charged for my free app but didn't have time to correct do to being late. Will NOT be coming here for lunch any more"}
{"text":"Great menu and overall service. I went to Crust for lunch and was able to have the steak sandwich and it was amazing! The Crust restaurant is definitely a clean, well run establishment.  Additionally, the customer service I received was nice and constantly checking up on me and my guest. Our waters were constantly filled and our food came out in no time.  I would recommend trying out anything on the menu since I was able to look around at other dishes people were ordering and it looked like you couldn't go wrong with any of it. Great food and great service. Make sure to go try Crust!"}
{"text":"So I ate here for the first time in a couple of years last night.  I remember the marinara sauce being absolutely phenomenal, robust, flavorful, perfection.  Tonight my friend and I started with fried mozzarella which was good, but the marinara sauce was exceptionally bland, just No real flavor at all.  We opted for a 20' traditional pizza.  It was very underwhelming, little if any sauce, unbelievably bland, with subpar crust.  Another disappointment...Iced Tea and service was good, but the pizza and marinara sauce was a major let down.  Makes we wonder if it was just an off night, have recipes changed, new MGT???  I really don't know, just very let down after hyping this place up so much from a previous visit to an out of town guest!"}
{"text":"When I was living in Tremont, this was the new pizza joint that was stepping into Edison's territory. I was taken back at first because they approached it differently. The pizza and crust was a little more doughy, they used fresh ingredients, everything was prepared and made in the morning, and they closed so damn early. Everything that was not Edison's !! I felt bad... like I was cheating on someone. But, I found out that Crust makes delicious, hot sandwiches and I forgot all about it. I love Crust ! All their specialty pizzas are good, which is anything with prosciutto on it. Just order prosciutto on the side or add it as an extra topping. It's a total G move.  One my favorite menu items has to be the meatball sub. I think it's really good. And, the Italian is good too. You should definitely try one !"}
{"text":"The meat and cheese board is one of the best deals in town, and I love the Pizza Rustica! Real, authentic pizza."}
{"text":"First time. Had the capocollo pizza and bacon blue cheese. Everything was fresh. Good chewy crust. I think a buck or two over priced. Also think I'm more so a red sauce pizza kind of guy though. May try the pasta if there's a next time."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Crust!  I have been here twice and I have met a different owner each time (I think there are two or three partners in this restaurant).  All of the pizzas are made from scratch and I love the sauce!  I have never had anything but the pizza (it is the specialty after all), but all the other menu items I have seen come from the kitchen look fabulous as well.  Another great thing about Crust is the wine list (great wines and an extensive list), not to mention they give you a fairly liberal pour!"}
{"text":"This place is tucked away to the left behind Albertsons! Don't miss it.  Food: Garlic knots: not on the menu anymore but they still make it. Comes with marinara sauce and an even number of knots to share. Highly recommend this appetizer! It's the perfect amount of doughy inside and crispy on the outside.  Medium thin crust pizza (forgot the name of the pizza but it's the only vegetarian one): like the knots, the crust is crunchy on the outside but soft inside. The pizza wasn't overflowing with flavor; to be honest it was a little bland at first but the basil gives it enough flavor.  Mac & cheese: haven't had such delicious mac & cheese in a long time. Macaroni is cooked al dente and the cheese isn't overwhelming.   Service: I was a little skeptical when I first walked in as nobody greeted me and I stood there for a good minute before acknowledged, but after I got seated I found everyone to be extremely polite and professional. Food came out quick and had no problems at all.   Interior: I couldn't quite figure out the ambience of the place. They had a bar with sports playing on multiple TVs but then it seemed as though they wanted to give off a romantic vibe as well with the dimmed lights. It was odd but I didn't mind it, although I'd definitely suggest sitting on the side without the TVs if you're on a date."}
{"text":"The pizza was so delicious. I'm a big fan of New York pizza and the pizza at this place is very similar to it. We had the thin crust pizza and chose our own topping. We really enjoyed the food but I have to give them a 3 stars due to the bad service. We were so disappointed with the way the waitress treated us. I would definitely want to eat the pizza here again but will only do take out due to the bad service."}
{"text":"Stopped in for takeout one night last week. Fast, friendly service at the counter and they had Hamilton calling the game in the background, so that was a plus.   Pizza was actually really good. Sandwich was good too, but I agree that the bread/filling ratio is too high. Price was good for both.  I will return for the pizza, fo sho."}
{"text":"The Grandma's deep dish pizza blew my mind. It was crispy, surprisingly light, and tasty. My only criticism is that the sangria was too sweet for my taste.   The service was very helpful and responsive. The quarters are a bit tight and the ambience could use some refurbishing, but other than that I would recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Food is awsome.management not so awsome.i went there with some girlfriends  and the waitstAff seemed to be o. Edge It was the snooty condescending attitude of the manager tammy.we will never go back till she is gone"}
{"text":"Magnifico!  You must eat here.  Friendly service, easy atmosphere, great food portions, and the flavor is there to savor.  Plenty of options for your slice of pie, and ice-cold coke in the glass bottle!"}
{"text":"My first time to Crust tonight and so impressed!  I used to think there was no such thing as a really good thin crust pizza in Cleveland, and in the last few years, this is changing-hooray!  Tonight I ordered the Finocchiona specialty pizza, the Park Salad, and when I arrived to pick things up I couldn't resist ordering a cheese slice to go as well.  First I devoured the (enormous! and a bargain at $3) cheese slice.  Yay-they actually use a hot hot oven-beloved char!  I was surprised by how flavorful the sauce was, and how perfectly crisp and cheesy the slice was.  This would be a great meal on its own.  The salad was an unexpected knock-out, with roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, red peppers,  kalamata olives, feta, and fresh fresh lettuce.  OH, and homemade dressing-I chose Parmesan and it was delicious! The salads are HUGE, by the way, and could be shared between 2-3 people if having pizza, too (I could only eat half). I had a small slice of the specialty pizza as well, and the rest will be my lunch tomorrow.  This was terrific as well- great, quality toppings and again, made the way Italians make pizza.  Nice people, too.  So excited to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to go for very flavorful Itallian at a very reasonable price. The rusticas are unique and tasty; I recommend the eggplant. The brushetta is also a great way to try many flavors in one order by picking 4 different kinds. Service is always good and it's an easy place for takeout as well."}
{"text":"Amazing quality rustic Italian food!  We've gotten the Spaghetti and Meatball Rustia a couple times and we are in love with it! It's yummy, original, and just fun! There was a mix up with my order last weekend, when I ordered to-go, I received an incorrect rolatini, I ordered meatball parm, instead I noticed I received an eggplant rolatini, however, I was already home when I found the mistake, I called immediately with the issue and it was rectified graciously with a credit.  The owner and most of the staff are extremely pleasant and kind. Thank you CRUST! Keep up your amazingness! :)"}
{"text":"My favorite Phoenix area pizza... And I have been everywhere. Try the unique, individual-sized rustica pizzas. Wine selection is good and the ambiance is really nice, romantic, yet not over the top."}
{"text":"Over priced and not very good. Inside is loud better to take out. Slow be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"the pizza was 10/10. The crust was flakey, the cheese was perfectly gold and the dough has a great flavor to it."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've been to this place and had a great chicken parm sandwich.  It was so filling and reasonably priced. I ordered a pizza to go while I was eating and they forgot to make it but quickly redeemed themselves and gave me a free pizza on top of the one I ordered.  Everything was amazing.  Definitely be back there soon!"}
{"text":"Service was great, very friendly and prompt.  Meat and cheese plate very nice combination, crust on pizza absolutely worth going.  Wines are good value with decent selection by the glass.  Cannoli a great finish to the meal."}
{"text":"Amazing! I went here for a localist event and I could not have had better service and better food to enjoy before going out to the baseball game. Be warned: the sangria can be addicting"}
{"text":"I don't know if I was angry the day I got that first pizza, but since that day, I have only had great pizza at this place.  Seriously, the crust is great.  I haven't had the Italian sausage pizza since that first review, so  I normally get a pepperoni and banana pepper pizza with the hand tossed crust.  I love thin crust but I think they over-oil  that crust too much where all the toppings  slide off.  still a great pizza!"}
{"text":"Free garlic knots with check in were okay but not worth paying for.  Ordered filet sliders.  Not real tender and buns well overdone.  Bacon mac n cheese not bad at all.  Meat pizza pretty disappointing.  Meatball was good.  Service good.  Too many better options in area to go back."}
{"text":"I believe in constructive criticism... I think the restaurant can focus a bit more on communication between the wait staff and the kitchen staff... today's experience was not good, I hope that management can take comments into consideration."}
{"text":"No No No, OMG Really, this place was sooooooooooooooo slow I can believe they are still in business. There were 8 patrons besides us and 6 had food already. We were served by the waitress/bartender. We waited 1+ hours for our food, the order was wrong, we never were refilled drinks, even when she said she would bring some she never did.  Also noted that 2 other customer had complaints with incorrect orders.  Ok now for the food, Yikes, ever hear of salt, I got the Sicilian pizza and tasted nothing, barely any sauce on it, crunchy burnt bottom where they over heated it. My friends each had the shaved ribeye sandwich, which tasted and looked like a ready made product that they are just reheating.  The good while very limited are 3 things:  1. The potatoes chips where awesome and seasoned well, but mass produced 2. The place was actually very clean and comfortable 3. The prices was very reasonable although for the service we received anything would have been too much.   Never again, hopes this helps would be customers"}
{"text":"My group of seven had lunch at this location today.  We arrived at noon.  They did not have our reservation.  We ordered.  It took the waiter 45 minutes to bring us our lunch.  They forgot an order.  Everything was brought out at once even though some people ordered a salad and an entree.  The salads were fair.  The pizza and pasta were good.   The waiter came by one hour later and I ordered a desert to go.  It took him 30 minutes to cut a slice of tirmasu and put it in a bag.  15 minutes later he brought 7 checks even though we only needed 4 for the group.  I finally asked the regional manager to help.  There is no excuse for this restaurant to make people wait 2 1/2 hours to complete a lunch.  There was no oversight.  The waiter was either incompetent or overwhelmed.  I would never go back."}
{"text":"My absolute FAVORITE place to grab lunch in Tremont and I am so glad they have opened. The service is excellent and the food is SO good. I have wonderful pregnancy cravings and their meatball sub is my current must have.   They also have pizza by the slice- just cheese but will they add toppings for you. The slices are huge and a good price.   Also out of this world their mushroom gnocchi. It's AMAZING."}
{"text":"Ambiance: 4. Crust is a hole-in-the wall, but it's a) clean, b) has a hip vibe with chalkboard for announcements, ipad for payment, and an open kitchen and c) is opening a patio shortly on front to eat at.  Still more of a to-go spot, but nice feeling like my food wasn't coming straight out of Ryan Reynold's movie \"Waiting\".  Cost: 5. I really didn't want to write this review initially because I want to keep Crust to myself.  A lot of their ingredients are fresh and they make dough fresh on the spot... but prices aren't any more than the average pizza shop ($10 to high-teens for medium and large pizzas).  Win.  Only one qualm- do not get fresh basil as a add topping, it's not \"fresh basil\" leaves as you'd think about it NY style etc, probably 10 cents worth of basil that was borderline out of a shaker.  Food Quality: 5. I don't write about pizza much, but it's actual a favorite of mine.  I've had it everywhere, from the best/most famous pizza shops in NY to deep dish favorites in Chicago.  From the Redwood forest, to the Gulf Stream waters, that's me and pizza.  Everywhere.  And I can honestly say despite Cleveland generally having some of the weakest pizza shops on average, Crust is probably in the top 10% of pizza I've had anywhere.  It's also amazing the breadth of high quality options.  Both the thin crust and regular crust have been up to par.  I've had the Lemon Rosemary Chicken Specialty pizza (great, although a bit heavy on the roasted potatoes) and build your own pizzas with no issues at all.  They also have relatively rare hard to find gourmet toppings like truffle oil, eggs, capicola etc.  Can't speak yet for the pastas or salads, but gauging from their attention to quality on the pizza they're probably strong it also.  FYI some reviews mentioned they are heavy on the garlic on the crust, this is true but if you don't like garlic juxtaposed with your pizza then you have other issues.  Service: 4. If you place an order they are friendly, unlike many pizza shops.  If you dine in they are down to earth and caring about customers.  My only knock is short hours right now (close at 7 or 8 on weekdays) but that's allegedly being extended soon.  Even in Cleveland, \"the city that always sleeps\", that close time needs to get to 9 or 10pm.  When to return: Pizza craving.  When someone tells you there's no good pizza in Cleveland.  Hipster watching.  Outdoor patio in summer.  Pizza pick up on the way home from work."}
{"text":"What Crust calls a \"slice of pizza\" other eateries call a \"small pizza,\" heck some even call it a \"Medium pizza.\" Not that I'm complaining.  I had always wanted to check this place out, even before it moved to it's new location with a cozy, bright ambiance that has the feel of a coffee shop. So when we found ourselves in Tremont on a Saturday afternoon we decided to carpe diem and check it out, knowing we could each get a \"slice\" and still be ready for dinner.  The menu had a decent beer list and some other drink options but sticking with the theme of pacing ourselves, we wenr with soft drinks. The menu also had some decent-sounding pasta options as well yummy looking sandwiches but we were in the mood for pizza.   I was expecting a limited choice of \"slices\" since pizzarias usually have some basic pizzas already made and they just pick up a wedge and slap it on a plate. But Crust promotes its \"scratch kitchen\" and these \"slices\" are all made to order and you have about 20-30 toppings (seriously) to choose from. But we froze and I went with just sausage and pepperoni and Jeannene had a mushroom and spinach. The server warned us that the size isn't your usual \"slice\" and she was right. They left us feeling satisfied but not stuffed (I would imagine two hungry people would want to split three slices or just add an appetizer).  The \"slices\" are just $4.50 plus $1 per topping so our bill ended up being the same as if if we had hit Zoup or Arabica for lunch. So yes, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food here just makes you happy.  This is what happens when you use the best ingredients and let them shine.  I have had almost everything on the menu and I have never been disappointed.  The Spaniard is my go to item though. Chorizo & goat cheese drizzled with a balsamic reduction & topped with baby arugula on a fresh baked bun, It is beyond amazing!"}
{"text":"Horrible.  Had 3 different servers and none of them were coordinating.  Got garlic knots to start but there was at least a half clove of garlic on them. So much so that it burned my mouth to eat them.  Ordered a Little John Pizza. It was not cooked all the way through and it made my wife and I sick that night.  Overrated and over priced. Food poisoning is a bonus."}
{"text":"Tried the pizza and at first bite i thought i had found some great NY style pizza. They have a great deal for a 20 inch pie for $10 on Sunday and Monday nights. It was foldable and had a good crust, but more bites revealed a crazy overuse of oregano in the sauce. All you could really taste was that spice and it just overwhelmed the whole pizza big time. It may have just been a bad batch of marinara or other mistake, but cut out 99% of the oregano and this could have been a good pizza find. In NY, the oregano is sprinkled on top of the pie. Oh, it's $2.50 for a topping."}
{"text":"Love this place. I get the Pizza Rustica with sausage/pepperoni every time. It's a wonderful thin crust. Good salads and wine. Not as big a fan of the larger pizza. Stick with the individual Rustica (it comes on it's own wooden plank). Pretty good gelato for dessert also!"}
{"text":"The service started off really, really slow and our party was worried. Once they caught up things were awesome! The food here is so yummy! The calamari was tasty due to some awesome Fra Diavolo sauce... the Italian salad was probably the best I've had in Scottsdale. We also has the N.Y. pizza, shrimp scampi, manicotti (delicious and huge portion), side of meatballs, and butter cake for dessert. We loved it all, and will definitely be back. Food is 5 stars... unfortunately the one star deduction is for the beginning service."}
{"text":"I think more people should give this place a try!  I've always gotten a crust salad when I come here - it's a great idea, similar to a taco salad bowl, except flavorful, crispy chewy pizza crust makes the bowl. The portion is just right, not a giant salad, but enough to satisfy.  Also - the fried mozzarella is perfect, with a robust sauce and cheesy fried goodness. I will have to get around to trying the pizza one day!"}
{"text":"There were two nice guys working there who served us before. SEP, 22, 2017, I went there to have dinner. The two nice guys were gone! I was pretty sad to find that out. I hope they were on break, if they were, I hope they were having a good break."}
{"text":"What do you say about a pizza place that makes their own salad dressings? The Ranch & Peppercorn were 'best in class'. I'm a salad guy; I've got a salad gut, what can I say? I think you'd say that that there is a pizza place that takes pizza making (and dressing making) seriously. Great thin chewy crust-perfect for folding. Great topping application & selection."}
{"text":"The Pizza was very, very good. The service was not good. I'm pretty sure one or both employees were really stoned   When I called to order, they didn't tell me how much the total was. They didn't ask for my name or tell me how long until it was ready. So I called back to check that my order had been submitted and they had all the info they needed. They said yes. When we arrived 20-30 min later to pick up our pizza, they went \"oh yeah, just a sec\" and made the pizza right then and said they had forgotten to make it.  Waited another 20 minutes.  So, they totally forgot to make our pizza but the pizza itself was great. It tastes like central/southern Italian pizza: good cheese, somewhat sweet sauce and perfect combo of chew & crunch in the crust."}
{"text":"Thin crust pizza with novel toppings... has the concept been done to death?  Maybe... with a plethora of other options sporting similar concepts, the warm smile of the proprietor stands out as a great feature of the place.  Small in size, it's definite a \"neighbourhood shop\".  Tartufo Bianco oil with actual truffles is always a plus.  So glad that's on the menu."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my most favorite places in the valley to get pizza! I'm highly involved in the philanthropic world And Crust always comes through in catering my events. The management and staff are extremely fabulous. I love this place--five stars hands down!!"}
{"text":"Crust has the best pizza in cle! Always love coming here for lunch! Roasted red peppers are my fav topping!"}
{"text":"Their pizzas are sort of ridiculous looking (like a male anatomy part) but the food is good! My husband had the meatball parm rollatini and liked it a lot - good crust, great flavorful marinara sauce, and good meatballs. I had the Tuscan salad which was fine. I really liked the pizza bread bowl, but the salad is lacking the fat content. The menu described marinated tomatoes so I was expected flavorful & oily tomatoes, but they were just a few regular sliced roma tomatoes with a sprinkling of herbs. There is no cheese on the salad which I think would greatly improve it."}
{"text":"Oh my I am hooked on the garlic knots and stuffed pizza!  yummy!  Oh and the waitress is so friendly.  Love, Love , love this place!"}
{"text":"Eh, not that impressive is this place. I actually rather enjoyed the decor of this place. I think the best thing about it was the brick oven. Anyways my friend and I ordered the meat and cheese board. Kind of lacking in the quality of meats and cheeses. Then we ordered that Grandma's pizza. Whoever made this pizza needs to be taught again. The ratios of crust was completely disproportionate. The bottom crust was way too thin, but the outer crust was almost appropriate. The sauce was too sweet, and the cheese was not completely melted. Then they only served half the pizza at a time. I mean who does that? Completely bizarre. Such an awkward experience at this place. The best part of my experience was the company that I was with. I will totally overlook this place in the future."}
{"text":"Great spot for lunch! Had a Cesar salad and the Bianca pizza. The crust was cooked perfectly. Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing Greek salad...loved the pizza, chicken parm sub was okay.  Fresh ingredients and huge portions.  Why do they make their pizzas in the shape of a penis?  It a least gave us a laugh!  Service could have been better - but it seemed like they only had one waitress working the whole place.  Tip - get more waiters!"}
{"text":"Every time I pick up from Crust it is never a let down.  Great service, great food.  Buying local is the way to go"}
{"text":"The pizza here is probably some of the best I've had in Cleveland.   Try the spaniard sandwich with a slice of pizza- great dinner that feeds two for $15 one of the best set-ups in Ohio City."}
{"text":"Great food and even better people that work there. Excellent place to grab a bite after work."}
{"text":"What a brutal dining experience.  In my many, many years of dining out, I have never experienced such terrible, unfriendly and unwelcoming service.  We walked in to the restaurant and it had a distinct odor, much like that of natural gas.  We hoped for the best and definitely got the worst.  From the moment we sat down, my friend and I were assaulted by murderous glances from the owner.  Was it because we brought our children to dine in his establishment?  How dare we?  We had to ask for bread, drinks, napkins a couple of times before receiving them.  The waitress was overwhelmed and not too kind either.  The food came out in waves, not all together as you would expect when dining in a restaurant.  The adult's food arrived at least 8 minutes before the children's, you'd think it would be the opposite.  The food was actually quite good, yet not good enough, to overcome the terrible discomfort that we felt being in this restaurant.  Truly, I would have felt more welcome in McDonald's.   In this economy, you should welcome each and every paying customer into your restaurant with open arms, or at least a smile.  A little kindness goes a long way....."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Brand new to Scottsdale. After two flubbed GPS searches for other places I settled on Crust and I am glad I did.  First class service - efficient, professional. Greeted by hostess, sat in the bar. Bartender (owner?) asked for a drink order, returned with San Pellegrino and let me know my server would be with me shortly.  Pinot noir and perfectly savory linguini dish (Italian sausage, sautéed spinach, white beans, butter, grated cheese and garlic). Great combination!   Wine pour could be a bit more generous and bad acoustics in box-like (strip mall) structure can be a tad distracting but overall a wonderful dining experience. Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"Tried their pizza today courtesy of my boss, I was so excited when he said he was treating for pizza and that it was coming from crust Ive always heard and read good reviews about this place.   Fast forward 40 minutes for pick up, that's a little crazy but it was a lunch time rush so ill let it slide. We ordered 2 different pies, one pepperoni and Italian sausage, the other one with roasted pepper and onion. We opened both pies and were ashamed, they didn't even cut the pie completely leaving it in one big mess of dough and cheese. One pie was okay it was fine to eat, but the other was only half good without us having to unscramble the  mess of cheese.  Slide to the taste, it was good, fresh, garlicky. The cheese was a bit loose, the dough on the bottom crust was soggy and watery , almost like it wasn't cooked all the way through. It was also extremely salty, maybe from the sauce maybe from the cheese but i definitely did not need all that sodium running through my body.The \"crust\" was actually the best part of the pizza (as per usual) it was the piece of pie with the most flavor.  not saying its horrible, but i was definitely disappointed with this pizza place. from presentation, to taste, i just don't agree with the rants and raves. to me its average and that's why it got 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is my favorite happy hour spot in this area of town. They have $5 wines by the glass until 5pm (go with the fancy red blend - not the crust blend though). They have a slew of deals for each day of the week. My boyfriend and I went for tortellini Tuesday. Unfortunately, the tortellini was SO salty. That could definitely just be my palate because I don't cook with salt at home. Otherwise it was delicious.   I've tried every vegetarian appetizer and bruschetta and let me tell you...they really blow it out of the park on the fried mozzarella. It's roll-your-eyes-in-the-back-of-your-head good. Perfect paired with a glass of wine.   If wine isn't your thing, never fear! On happy hour they have $6 cocktails including a perfectly made mule. Don't stop there! In fact, I'll order you a cab right now, because you HAVE to try their sangria. It is so wonderfully brandy and not-so-sweet. My favorite sangria in town. Last time we were there we wished we could get a growler of sangria to go.   My go-to is ordering a side pasta with marinara. You can also order \"half\" pastas during lunchtime. One note for all y'all vegetarians out there - their vodka sauce has ham chunks in it. Fortunately they were very easy to pick out.   Love this place! Perfect little neighborhood pizza and pasta joint."}
{"text":"Not a place I would return to. Slow food service & not worth the wait. Nice atmosphere & pleasant wait staff.  Mediterranean chicken dish not recommended, Marsala chicken average at best, too much pasta."}
{"text":"Daaaaaaang Crust! That slice of za was bigger than my forearm! Was dwelling on the fact of how much I missed those big juicy slices of NYC Pizza and Crust came pretty damn close I'll tell ya what!   Love it! Can't wait to go back for more :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to come for food and wine. Pizza was great. Pastas also very good. Diane was our server. Very kind and did a great job.  Will recommend to others!!!"}
{"text":"Checked out the subs......so very good.   Enjoyed the meatball sub (their meatballs are devine) and the club.  I was on tastebud overload.  We asked for the club to be prepared as a hot sub.  The flavors were layered and it was AMAZING!    I LOVE crust!"}
{"text":"i have a SUPER hard time giving this place less than 3 stars. I am convinced it was an off day. I went a few weeks back and went back and forth on whether or not i should write a review.    I normally wouldn't review it until after i gave it a second chance but i honestly don't see myself ever giving it a second chance. so because of that i will rate based on my belief that this place actually is better than my experience.  i want to start with the positive. i like the casual space and i love the chef standing by the oven. he is so cute. looks like he's straight off of a nintendo game. mario-esque. he looks like he's totally just jolly and humming while he works. i love him. i also like the prices.  now to the nitty gritty.  we were in a rush and i had heard they do pizza by the slice. sounds fast to me.  well, it wasn't.  we take a seat at the bar and the bartender is basically on the other side shouting at us? i wasn't even sure he was talking to us. did he want us to shout across and over all of the other people at the bar? this wasn't a loud place, it was actually super quiet in there so the shouting was very awkward and obnoxious. i like to be greeted somewhat close to my face, not shouted at. made me really uncomfortable.   then he was chit chatting on his phone, it was obviously a personal call. we just sat waiting and waiting to order our slices. finally he makes it close to us to take our order and the jolly pizza oven man gets to work :) I'm not sure what took so long after that but it took forever to get our slices. we were there for 30 minutes when i had expected it to take about 5-10.   my friend got the plain cheese slice and i got the prosciutto arugala slice. both were pretty nasty. mine smelled like feet and fish. that went in the trash. we split her cheese slice to hold us over until we had time to pick up something else."}
{"text":"My husband gets his hair cut next to Crust so now I'm always looking forward to his next haircut so I can have him bring home some food from Crust. The Spaniard sub is one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. The best pizza I've had from here is the one with prosciutto (or maybe some other thin Italian meat) and arugula all over it. Oh man."}
{"text":"A torrential downpour early Monday evening when we found out Ginko is closed brought us to Crust which I had been wanting to try for some time. Needless to say, Angelo is pissed because his pies are half off on Mondays.  At first glance, the inside was pretty cozy and only had a few tables. It was also the same temperature as a sauna in the middle of summer. Do they not have AC? This is Cleveland which is never mild so I didn't really get that. The young lady that took my order was very friendly but didn't really give me a recommendation when I asked for one and said I had never been before. Maybe the oddest part about the whole experience was that Mariah Carey was on repeat the entire time we were there. Always Be My Baby wasn't good even in 1993 and I certainly never want to hear it multiple times while in a hipster neighborhood..  We ordered a Caesar salad and a medium pepperoni marguerite pizza. The salad came out first and was nothing more than chopped romaine with 1 large quartered tomato and some chopped fresh Parmesan with the dressing on the side. Yes, I said that - a Caesar with the dressing on the side. Who ever heard of such a thing? The tomato wasn't very tasty and was not sweet at all like I was hoping for and the salad didn't even have croutons. I know a Caesar salad is a generally pretty basic salad but it shouldn't be hard to just do it right, and this one was half-assed for $8. The pizza came out hot and the crust was really delicious, nice and soft but a little crispy on the bottom. The same tomatoes covered the pizza though so you can imagine I wasn't thrilled at the bland taste. I'd say overall this was worth 2-1/2 stars but I gave them the benefit of the doubt because I believe we just didn't order the right things...hence why I think a front line worker should always have a recommendation so I don't F up my order and not like it. I'll give it another chance sometime though!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Been coming for years. Started on a pizza/rustica kick and have branched it into the entrees, and very glad I did. Once you try the sausage, spinach and white bean pasta, it's hard to order anything else.   The mac & cheese is my kid's favorite...!!  The perfect neighborhood joint...  Thx Mitch and Mike."}
{"text":"We tried to go to Crust opening weekend, but they had run out of crust. We finally went back last week. We got a large hand tossed, I think? Pepperoni pizza, ricotta gnocchi, & a Caesar salad. Fantastic food! There's something addictive about the pizza. The sauce is fresh, the crust is perfectly chewy & crispy. Great fresh ingredients. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For my second visit to Crust, I convinced my friends who are also mothers of twins to go and have our girls night.  We had an awesome time.  The pizza rustica is so delicious.  I wolfed it down so fast I didn't realize I had no left overs for my husband to take home.  We were having such a great time and a nice couple on the next table decided to buy our wine bottles. That was a really sweet gesture. I can't wait to come back.  Actually, I am going to check out their new restaurant on Tatum and Bell.  Our server mentioned it opened a couple of days ago.  That branch is closer to us and I was told Toni, the guy at the oven making the pizzas will be there."}
{"text":"First of all, I am not a huge pizza fan.  Therefore, you are not likely to find me doing somersaults, and singing \"Some Enchanted Evening\" over a piece of pizza.  Nonetheless, I give Crust 4 stars.  I greatly enjoyed their Rustica.  This thin crust, personal sized pizza (I had the meat Rustica) was loaded with fresh ingredients, and most enjoyable.    Another unexpected surprise was a fairly nice wine list to go along with your Sicilian fare.  The only thing that kept Crust from 5 stars was that the experience was lacking.  To go from good to great, you must learn to present your patrons with a wonderful experience.  The service was good, not great.   On the experience meter, I would give them a two.  Crust, work on delivering a world class, Disney type experience and I think you could really explode.  Your food was great!  My experience was mediocre.  Nonetheless, if someone ever asks me where to go for a nice slice of Sicily, I will happily recommend Crust Pizza & Wine Cafe.  PS - the videos you provided on your website sold me to come to your establishment.  Otherwise, I probably wouldn't have driven 22 miles for a piece of pizza.  Congrats on sharing your story in a memorable way."}
{"text":"Would highly recommend coming here! Best pizza in town! Service is amazing as well! Not only can you get good pizza but amazing bruschetta as well!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good atmosphere. The prosciutto and arugula rustica is one of our favorites and the mozzarella encorrozza is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service overwhelmed the experience for me. It was over attentive for my taste. Maybe try take out instead of dining in."}
{"text":"This pizza place just rocks.  I am visiting from Milwaukee, and my uncle had been here once before and wanted to go back.  He has good taste!  We got the hot margherita pizza, which is a standard margherita pizza with hot pepperoni.  The pizza was amazing - and the crust (we got regular) was just out of this world.  The chef said they use pecorino cheese along with garlic to make it so tasty.  They also make everything fresh in house the day of - which speaks to why it tasted so fresh.  They also have all homemade salad dressings to go with their salads.  I got the caesar on a recommendation from the waitress, and she was right on.  To top it off, they make this flourless chocolate cake dessert in house and serve it with raspberry sauce.  DECADENT to the extreme and a perfect ending to a long day.  :)  All in all, Crust was much more than I expected, and I can honestly say I can't remember the last time I had pizza this good.  Check it out when you can - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Had their thin crust pizza and salad.  Everything was tasty.  They have a great happy hour menu so come out between 3-6pm."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Scottsdale!!! I love coming here! Everyone is so friendly and I've never ordered something I didn't like!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed, pizza was very oily, see pic  looked like someone poured an entire bottle of oil on my pizza."}
{"text":"I read about Crust Pizza and Wine Cafe just a few days ago in this month's issue of 944 magazine, and immediately I was excited to give a try.  The article pointed out that the owner, Mike Berindino, grew up in Long Island, and he learned pizza tossing from his father who owns a couple of small pizzerias in New York.  I wasn't extraordinarily hungry, so I just grabbed a slice of Spinach and Broccoli (only $2.50!)  It hit the spot and I'll definitely be back.  The interior is brand-spankin' new and modern, which I liked, and the lighting was calming, however the chairs were a bit hard and uncomfortable for my liking... but I digress.  I could've done without the damn flat-screen, too,  but I gave up on caring about TV's in restaurants long ago.  Why does every business need one, though?  Interesting enough, the salads are served in bowls made of crust, but I have yet to try one - I just saw it on the menu.  Their website is www.crustscottsdale.com, and I recommend you check it out.  I plan on going back soon to give the Rustica a try, as well as sample some vino, at which time I'll bring a friend so I won't be so critical...  Nice place, though!  Maybe a little too nice..."}
{"text":"Wow. Fantastic pizza, huge slices. Crispy crust, sweet sauce. The sausage is great. Expect a line at lunchtime, this place gets packed. Best pizza I've had in cleveland."}
{"text":"The first time I checked this place out, I was slighty confused about the menu and pizza choices.  Not your typical pizza/wine bar menu (turns out to be a good thing!).  We came at a busy time, and I feel like the wait staff didn't take the time to explain the menu to us.  We ended up ordering the thicker pizza, which was pretty good.    The several times after that we tried a few different items, and loved them!  The Rustica is perfect for one, thin and cheesy.  I also love the Caesar Salad served in a pizza dough bowl....yummy!  On the last visit we tried the Mac and Cheese, which was thick, full of chedder flavor, and just crisp enough on top.  Definitely enough to share!  The wine list is pretty extensive, but too pricey by the glass.  The Pinot Grigio I had was $8.00 and nothing special.  It's also disappointing that the happy hour is half off bottles, rather than the glass.    The service is definitely slower than average, which was okay.  And if you go on a busy Saturday night, the place gets very, very loud.   Luckily, the pizza makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Sure the pizza slices are huge - one small slice needs a pizza box to take it to go.  Salads are super fresh and good.    The Strawberry Lime dressing is heavenly! They need to bottle the stuff.  House made, super fresh and yummy. More Please!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, since I've heard such great things about it! Went for dinner, and we were surprised they were already out of slices at 8pm on a Friday night. We ended up ordering a large spanish chorizo pizza with the hand tossed crust. The crust was great (you would hope since that's the name of the restaruant lol)! Toppings were tasty, but it was a pretty greasy pizza. The price was on point- four of us ended up paying less than $20 total, so that's definitely a plus! Overall, it was not the best I've ever had but definitely tasty, and worth trying at least once!"}
{"text":"\"We came here for a quiet dinner but found ourselves in a middle of a loud and raucous Happy Hour. \"  \"That was our introduction to Crust Pizza & Wine Cafe. The wait staff was buzzing around. Constantly asking if you wanted something, or if you were done with that plate.  We ordered a bunch of appetizers, a salad and two glasses of wine. The food was excellent!\"  I wrote those words about twenty months ago. It was through my own procrastination and laziness that I never finished my review  Not a lot has changed though in the interim. Just forty Yelp'ers reviews talking up the place and a even harder parking lot to navigate on a Friday night at 5:30. LOL  The place has a very New York feel to it and the pizza is very close to the real thing.   The only drawback was the over abundance of sauce, which made it sloppy. But the place has a good buzz to it. Things go smoothly and as I've noted the wait staff is on their game. It can be a very loud restaurant and depending on where you sit, you may not be able to hear your companion.  Tonight we tried the olives appetizer ($3.00), along with the white bean bruschetta ($5.00). Both were good. We agreed to order the twenty inch New York pie ($15.95) to eat and to bring some home. It was a good decision said our oldest!  The Kendall Jackson was a good choice and for $5.00 a glass an even better deal. A pint of their IPA was a steal at $3.00 and was a nice bitter. A Brit would be very happy here. Our bill came to $43.53 including taxes, but before gratuities.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is not your run of the mill pizza shop. You can tell they really care about their products, everything is fresh, they take the time to hand make all their pizza dough, bread and gnocchi. The staff is very freindly and food is quick.  We ordered their longer than your arm lemon rosemary chicken  pizza slice. (garlic roasted potato, fresh rosemary, mozz, tomatoes, feta, red pepper flakes, lemon zest, and black pepper). The combination of flavors was great. The chicken was moist, loved the fragrance of the rosemary and the dough was amazing.  Roasted eggplant sub. (Baby arugala, roasted tomatoes, pecorino romano, smoked mozz, tomatoes basil mayo). This is one of the best eggplant sandwiches we have ever had. The eggplant was sliced into large pieces and roasted to perfection. They cut the eggplant in nice large pieces so the finished product was not mushy and the smoked mozz and tomato  basil mayo rounded it out perfectly.   Mushroom Ricotta Gnocchi. (mixed mushrooms, fresh rosemary, garlic, white truffle oil in a light parmesan cream sauce). The gnocchi was soft and tender. The mushrooms had great texture, but the amount of sauce on the dish just over powered everything. For me it needed about half of the sauce it had and a little more seasoning.    They really do a great job and make great food. We had a great experience and will definitely return."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to check out their new location. Very nice, modern atmosphere with a few tables and bar seating. Great menu from appetizers, salads, handrolled pasta, subs, huge pizza by the slice or you can order a whole pizza. Our waitress Erin was amazing, super friendly and knowledgable and that made our experience quite enjoyable.   We ordered a slice with fresh garlic, roasted potatoes, slab bacon and smoked mozzarella. First the slice is as long as your arm, cooked perfectly and for as long as it is it still manages to stay straight while you hold it. The taste is fantastic and the toppings taste fresh. We also tried their fried pepperoni, mozzerella bites. The outside was nice and crispy, the inside nice and soft and it had great cheese pull. Also my wife built her own salad, and said it was one of the best salads she has ever had. They really have great food, staff and it's always a great experience."}
{"text":"I am on the Crust email list, but hadn't been in lately. I received an email about \"fast\" M-F lunch specials, which intrigued me because I'm always in a rush at lunch.  I had read the Yelp reviews about the slow service, so I was a bit worried about trying Crust again, but my curiosity won out, and I went there for lunch.  The restaurant was about half full when I arrived. I decided to sit at the bar, where I could watch the pizzas being cooked in the wood fired pizza oven.  I was waited on immediately and received impeccable service from the waiter. I tried the salad, slice, and drink lunch special for $6.95. The pizza was good bit the salad was truly amazing. Fresh greens, a good amount of olives, no onions (yea!), and ranch dressing. You had your choice of dressing and they also had a Cesar salad available as part of the lunch special. The iced tea was delicious as well.  I will definitely add Crust to my lunchtime repertoire."}
{"text":"An all home made kitchen all the time, whats not to like?   1) Bring your own beer or wine. They have openers at the counter. 1a) If you forget to bring beer or wine, they sell it across the street at the bookstore. (I know, weird. But just go with it.)  2) Park in the adjacent lot. Big bonus in Ohio City, off street parking.  3)  Ask for the pizza \"well done\". 4) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Crust keeps it simple, local pizza joint that offers more than your usual fare. Homemade and delicious, perfect for lunch or a quick dinner. Never left waiting, and the food always arrives hot! Recommend the Capocollo specialty and the mushroom gnocchi, but really everything is outstanding."}
{"text":"REALLY enjoyed it.  I had the seafood pasta, and while the calamari was overcooked, the manager made sure I was happy when I left.   The spinach dip was out of this world good.  We did have a bit of a wait on a Friday night, but the place is small and it is to be expected."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!  Deb is amazing and kind and responded IMMEDIATELY to my message. Delivered pizza exactly on time and perfect pies. You need to use Crust for your next party!!!"}
{"text":"I can't remember the name of the special salad we had tonight with Shrimp, but I will never forget the taste.  FABULOUS is an understatement!  The NY pizza was equally as great.  Every time I come here I say to myself, we need to come more often.  Everything is always good.  Diane was our server tonight.  What a cutie!  More important is that the service was excellent!  Diane was back at our table many times checking to see if there was anything else she could do for us.  Another comment I want to make is there was a young man taking care of the table.  At some point I thanked him and was surprised to receive \"Your more than welcome\", instead of the typical \"No Problem\" statement coming from young people.  I should have gone to the management to tell them I was impressed by him, his smile and mannerisms.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Spent 10 years of my life in Brooklyn NY and I know Pizza inside out , Crust is my Fave Valley pizza place, I also love their Bruschetta, I'm always satisfied with the Service . Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So we came here for a big carb up night two days before our first Olympic Triathlon and boy oh boy was that the perfect idea.  We snuck in about 30 minutes before closing time and were treated to some great service by the young lady waiting upon our table.  As I navigated through the menu I thought I'd build my own because I wanted just enough, well just enough could actually feed two people.  I ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs and my Girlfriend the Grandma's pasta.  I abhor ricotta, I think it should only be used in tender amounts in Lasagna and backed up by loads of beef.  That's why I didn't go for the Lasagna, but the sausage that came with the Grandma's pasta was very good.    The wine selection looked very promising and we're been meaning to return but that just hasn't been the case.  But I could be in for some that delicious looking pizza."}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting anything great from this place.  Just another pizza place in a strip mall blah blah blah.  However, I was pleasantly proven wrong and this place puts out a very respectable pizza.  I went here with a party of 4 a few days ago.  It was a weeknight at about 7:30 and the place was pretty crowded but we were seated promptly.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful.  She also brought me a carafe of ice tea so she wouldn't have to keep running back to refill me.  I know it is stupid but it is the little details that matter to me.  Anyway, about the food:  * Caesar and Greek Salads = The full is enough to share with 2-3 people but the bread bowl they serve it in is a bit of a waste if you ask me because I try not to fill up on bread before my pizza.  Anyway, the salads were pretty good.  * Grandma's and Little Nicky Pizza = EXCELLENT!! We all shared 1 large that was half Grandma's and half Little Nicky.  It was more than enough for 4 people.  The crust was awesome as it should be given this place's name.  Not too hard, not too soft, not floppy, not too chewy, etc. etc.  The Little Nicky was phenomenal and I am definitely getting that next time along with some other ones I want to try.  I just hope they will let me split a pizza among 3-4 different kinds.  I also want to try that \"thong\" pizza.  Pro Tips:  * Get the Local Dines 50% off gift cert ( http://bit.ly/dfR4eQ ).  Works like a champ and well worth it!  * Don't get the gelato.  I tried it and I think it was old and freezer burned.  The flavors aren't even that good.  They got me with the small cone for $1, but it wasn't even worth it."}
{"text":"Pizza was just ok, we order take out, we were requested to pick the pizza 25-30 minutes later, my husband got on time and when he came back home (about 3-5 minutes drive), the pizza was lack of taste,already cold and soaked by the excessive amount of tomato sauce. Definitely not the first experience that we expected. We tried because all the great yelp reviews, well personally I will not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"A great neighborhood stop with a pretty extensive menu!! Try their Rustica's - which are their thin-crusted very rustic pizza.  I also took a peek in the window at their Rollatini's which are their version of a calzones - next time I am in I will give them a whirl. We started with bacon wrapped shrimp skewers - WOW allotta love there!!! A good selection of wines, nice interior, modern, clean and pretty inexpensive! My kinda place =0)"}
{"text":"It is a favorite lunch spot of mine. I only get a plan slice and a brownie (if they have them). I also get a side of sauce to dip my crust in because it is too good not to eat! I would recommend getting a brownie for the road as well. They are super moist! They have coke products."}
{"text":"Not my favorite pizza. The Crust was Too thin and soggy and it took forever to get your food. Place wasn't busy on a Thursday night that should have  been my first clue. Wait staff are friendly but service is slow."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch one day around 11:30, definitely before the noon lunch rush. I ordered the Italian sub sandwich because I didn't know I could get pizza by the slice until it was too late.  Sub was awesome and the pizza slices I saw being delivered to customers on the table were huge and looked great .  Service was a little slow, 15 minutes to get my sandwich after waiting in a long line to order. But it was worth it. Definitely be back for Pizza..."}
{"text":"One of the worst dining experiences we've ever had. Pizza was awful and the service was worse. My favorite part was a manager witnessing our disaster of an over hour long lunch from the table next to us and doing nothing. Avoid this place, there are way too many great pizza places in Scottsdale to suffer through a meal here."}
{"text":"I've been looking for good pizza since moving to Ohio.  I never found a good place in Columbus, but since moving to Cleveland I've found two.  One of these was on my \"must try\" list for awhile, but I only went for the first time recently--Crust.  Aptly named, their crust is delicious, especially the hand tossed, and their pizzas are comprised of some of the more flavorful toppings I've had.  Despite what might be described as gourmet pizza, the atmosphere here is casual and friendly--very comfortable--and during warm weather one can sit out front on the patio.  I'd call this a must for anyone living in or visiting Cleveland who desires an amazing pizza."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We go to pizza every Tuesday so we have been dozens of places. This makes the top 5. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I haven't written a review in a while, but damn, I gotta say something about Crust.    Yes, it's true the slices are as big as your head. Such novelty may lead you to believe that this place is all about size (*hey now*). Not true at Crust!  I've quickly become a regular to this pizza/salad/sub joint near China Town. The pizza is excellent, sold by both the slice and whole pie. The crust (the best part) is chewy and crispy with a soft center. Melts in your mouth. The toppings are super fresh. No canned mushrooms here!   The subs are my new fav. They make the bread fresh every day. Same goodness as the pizza. A big pet peeve of mine is biting in to a sub with crusty bread and having the contents spray my lunch mate in the face. Not happening at Crust. The bread is crusty enough to have a good texture, but soft enough to bite through easily. So far, I've tried the Philly, Chicken Parm and Club. All are excellent.   If you want something sweet, I highly recommend the brownie. It's cake-like, nice and gooey and rich. Leave some room for these babies!  Having said all this, I'm afraid I may have to switch to salads. Otherwise, I won't be able to fit in the door.  Love you, Crust!"}
{"text":"I really really enjoyed Crust!  I came here for my birthday dinner in July and was absolutely impressed. The service is good and the food is even better, despite the fact that the pizzas are all oddly phallic looking (my inner 13-year-old self just giggled). Appetizers are all good, and the pizza is made fresh to order. I got a pasta dish that was phenomenal (something with a vodka sauce of some sort) and it was delicious! Another person in our party got an all-white pizza that was also really really good (in my opinion the best thing we ordered all night)   Very affordable and a cute little restaurant, especially for a week night dinner or casual date!"}
{"text":"Great place to sit at the bar and watch the roaring pizza oven on a cold Arizona winter night.  We stumbled upon this place one night, when the Sushi place next door looked to packed to get in.  I'm glad we stopped by. Pretty good caesar, served in a bread bowl.  We decided to share their smaller thin crust pizza shaped like Italy (I think) great spicy marinara, and pepperoni.  Washed it all down with a couple brews and a glass of wine for the wife.  At the end of dinner, we got a couple of bite sized gelato cones at $1 a piece.  Great way to end a meal without gorging on a big dessert.  This would be a good place to meet up with friends, and share a pie and some good wine.  Another great little Scottsdale gem."}
{"text":"This place was a lot of fun - relaxed atmosphere, great food, and great wine.  We ordered the wine of the month for March, which was a Neprica, and immediately afterward had to look up where we could buy it back home.  I had the meat rustico, which I would definitely order again.  This was one of my favorite meals while we were visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place has great pizza and an amazing antipasta salad. The pizza is HUGE!!! So big that they only brought half of it to our table, then put the other in a box. Only con is there full size pizzas are a little pricey... and they need more servers because we waited for awhile for our waitress to come back by to fill drinks."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pizza here. The service was good. It was really busy so it took a long time to get our food and drinks."}
{"text":"affordable pizza  a tad salty  called crust for a reason!  reliably good  friendly staff  simple perfection"}
{"text":"Pretty solid pizza. I got a medium pepperoni pizza and it was quite good. The sauce was very fresh/interesting. Not the best pizza I've ever had, but still good. They have a lot of unique specialty pizzas, but I can't speak to their taste because that's not really my thing. The place itself is quite small, only a handful of 4 person tables, seems more like a place where you order to go."}
{"text":"So much food! It's so much food for the price. My husband and I stopped in and each had a slice. It was great pizza only surpassed by the novelty of the size."}
{"text":"Lets start with the name. they did, and its AWESOME. The crust was SUPERB. crispy on the bottom, chewy at the edges, just like its supposed to be! and the flavor! WOW! THE BEST crust ive ever had. And as far as the toppings, they were fantastic TOO. Stuffed peppers as a topping?!?!? perfect. the sauce was incredible too.  Conclusion? the best pizza around. period"}
{"text":"So the boys and girls of Crust are up, running and have figured out what they're going to do.  Things have changed somewhat in the little shop across from Visible Voice.  Not bad changes, mind you; just changes.  I first encountered Crust on a soft-open mode night many moons ago and picked up some by-the-slice to go.  They were normal sized slices and they were $2 a-pop.  Nowadays when you go to Crust, the normal sized slices have been run out of the neighborhood by a mammoth pie that lords over the counter, daring you to approach.  One slice will kill your hunger.  Two puts you in a coma.   The crust is still as delicious as day 1, garlicy, crisp on bottom, chewy afterward.   The sauce is bright, rich and perfect.  The toppings are fantastic and VERY high quality.    I had a revelation; however:  I went to Crust one night and created a \"supreme\" pizza to take home.  They didn't have one on the menu, so I simply did the \"pepperoni, sausage, onion, peppers and mushrooms\" thing and happily took my pie.  We ate it, and yes, it was good, but not magical.  Hmmm...  Whahappen?  It dawned on me.    I'm no chef.  I'm no expert of pizza.  These guys create flavor combinations for a living.  Who the heck am I to go pile a bunch of random stuff on a pizza and expect it to be amazing?   But Chris, Pizza Hut and Dominoes do it all the tim--- oooooh...   Epiphany.  Mike and Jeff have already taken the time to make some insane flavor profiles for your pizza enjoyment.  Order one from the menu.  Don't substitute.  Don't build your own.    One day at Crust Mike asked me to try a slice of pizza with arugula and balsamic glaze.  Okay, sure; thanks Mike.  Took it home, fully intending to hate it.  Damn vegetables and stuff on my pizza, meh...  Then I took a bite.   Insert random chorus from My Morning Jacket.  Done.  Best pizza ever.  Just go to Crust, folks.  Ignore any reviews about this place lower than 4 stars."}
{"text":"The service was good. The Italian sandwich really mostly bread had very little flavor on it. I would not recommend it.  I also ate bacon and blue salad.  There blue cheese dressing is really good. I had ask for more bacon.   The use descriptive words for sandwiches and bacon that don't fit.  My co worker got the pizza she said its ok nothing special compared it Little Cesar's . My two other co workers did love the eggplant sandwich so Kudos.  So service and eggplant gave you 3. ."}
{"text":"Great service great food! The pizza isn't for everyone so if your a jerk who likes dominos you won't appriciate this amazing pizza! It's thinner than humble pie (at least the rustica) but not as thin as sauce ( which is nowhere near as good as this place) GO NOW!"}
{"text":"I would love to give this place four stars, but here's our experience after several visits.   My husband and I are fans of the food. They have very tasty dishes. We have been there several times and have tried the chicken parm, cesar salad, spinach salad and the original rustica pizza; all of which were very good. We love the sauce because it does have a sweet flavor -- right up our alley.   The service, however, could be better. Perhaps it is the layout of the restaurant that prohibits the wait staff from providing great service. I'm really not sure. I have read other reviews where customers are raving about their servers. I cannot say the same unfortunately. Let's just say that out of the five times we have visited this restaurant, we have had to work with the server/manager 2-3 times in order to get something fixed (burned pizza, missing items from salads, etc). Yes, they fixed it, but considering that this is a pricier place for food, I would expect much better service.  Don't get me wrong, we will be going back because they do have very good food. I just know that there is room for improvement. After all, they did not just open.  One last tip -- put on your eye glasses in order read their menu; the tiny font that they use hurts my eyes. It is very difficult to read and especially in the late afternoon when they have dimmed the lights."}
{"text":"I was going to order an item for more money but the way I was treated from when I sat down this time was no different from the last so i went with the slices an low and behold she ended up giving me greif for everything I asked. How can you be so short and rude to a paying customer? No suggestions or anything? She failed the curiosity test. SERVICE, FAILED....TWICE. I'm sorry if me paying your business money is an insult to you but you give me deliberate bad service becuase you treated me like crap the first time and I let you know about it. Not the worst I have ever encountered but pretty bad...   I went again for lunch on 9/14/12 and forgot about my previous review, which was about how the good service started only when the waitress was waiting on the tip... well i checked in on yelp while I was there last week and OH MY GOD I felt like I was on the east coast! Rude!!!!! She had a horrible attitude when we had to ask for a refill, threw the bill on our table. She event went as far as playing a song on the juke box by Michael Jackson \"Somebody's watching me\" well yeah... you give bad service I'm gonna watch out for it but I got stuck with her again and well it sucked and this time it was worse.   I'll keep going back because the pizza is great but 3 stars until false royalty complex is fixed."}
{"text":"I'm giving you back one star because, AND ONLY AFTER, re-cooking my leftovers in the hottest oven I can manage in my apartment, the cheese melted, the meat was cooked and the doughy center of the edge crusts finished baking. This is sad. If I call in a takeout order from a pizza joint, I expect it to be a few things... fully cooked being one of the more important ones. I didn't just drop in for a slice.   Also, the bacon on the other half of my sub was not even cooked. Just fatty, uncooked gristle. Wonderful. I'd take away a half star if I could."}
{"text":"Crust is fantastic. The food is great and they have an amazing deal on Monday's where all the bottles of wine are half off. The staff is super friendly and takes great care of you. The ambiance inside is warm and inviting. My only compliant would be often times they run out of the very popular wines on their list which can be annoying for a regular who comes in specifically for the Monday deal. Overall definitely a cute local spot that is worth trying."}
{"text":"I've been in several times.  Overall I think it is fairly mediocre.  We had a really good experience on our first visit.  We sat at the bar, the bar tender was super friendly and the service was great.  That first visit I had one of the pizza (Not sure about the shape) which I though was decent (I prefer a thinner crispier crust), but overall good.  Based on the first visit I would have granted Crust four stars.    Since our first visit it has gone downhill.  We live in the neighborhood so this could have been the perfect neighborhood hangout.  We brought my partner's mother and grandmother in on a Friday night (Memorial Day Weekend).  There was only one waitperson (but three busboys...)  The service was slow, the music was too loud, but the food was good.  I had the special which was delicious.  I would have given this visit three stars, knocking off another star for bad, slow service.  We have been in one additional time.  The service continues to go downhill.  We sat at the bar and it was all we could do to get the attention of the bartender to serve us anything.  We finally had the Penne alla Scottsdale.  It's a good dish.  However, I am knocking off the final star for continued service problems.  I don't think we will go back because we found a new Italian place up on Shea that we like a lot better.  It's further away, but the service is always good.    Overall, the food at Crust is good and it has a decent wine list, it's just a bummer to eat somewhere where the wait and bar staff are apathetic."}
{"text":"Love coming here on a weekday! Great house wine and absolutely love the salad pizza aka arugula and prosciutto pizza. Have never had a bad experience with service or food! Definitely a must to go to if you have never been."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been wanting to try this place. When playing a show in Tremont, we decided to give it a go. The employees were really nice. The pizza was gigantic and decent. It was not the best I ever had, but we also got cheese and pepperoni. We didn't try one of the specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Sooo the pizza was pretty good the only complaint was how thin the pizza was compared to the crust. It was so thin the sauce & cheese made it mushy. The crust however was on point! Overall good just wish it wasn't so flimsy & mushy. I did get take out so maybe that could be why from sitting in the box."}
{"text":"Overall good experience. My coworkers and I ordered takeout. 2 large pizzas, a salad, and a sandwich. It was ready in 20 minutes. The pizza was good but very greasy, leaking through the paper plate. The salad was good but not a ton of toppings but very fresh. The sandwich was also good but not revolutionary.  Looking forward to trying again."}
{"text":"WOW WOW and WOW I was a pizza eater every friday night when my son was growing up, I have had just about every pizza in the city. This by far is the BEST pizza I have EVER had. The sauce ohhh the sauce just the right amount of spice and the pepperoni I could eat a whole stick by itself. The crust tastes so fresh and they cook it to perfection. I asked for fresh basil and let me tell you that was the icing on the cake! This pizza tastes so good you will have to stop yourself from eating the whole thing. They also have a chocolate cake that is to die for. And Mike and his crew are soooo nice and friendly they make you feel like family and are very accommodating he will make a pizza any way you like it. I like my crust a little chewy so he takes it out a little early for me. The only complaint I have is there is just one location! Do yourself a huge favor stop in see Mike and meet the new place and people that you will be getting your pizza from!!"}
{"text":"Love the butternut squash gnocchi! I add chicken to it and make two meals out of it. Hearty and filling dish!"}
{"text":"Absolutely and unequivocally the best pizza in Cleveland.  The crust shines here, crispy, salty, delicious.  The toppings are of the highest quality it seems (but I think they changed which pepperoni they used). I always order a pepperoni and kalamata olive pizza and it's always great.    They seem to put a lot of care into what they do and I really appreciate that.    Their salads are huge and awesome too. Tasted the Greek salad and man they don't skimp on feta or kalamata olives at all.    I have not had their gnocchi. I hear it's amazing.    If they have the cheesecake in the cooler, buy it. It's fantastic.    * I am not going to review them on their slices.  They just aren't as good as the whole pizza, but it doesn't knock them down at all for me.  If you want a slice go to Vincenza's or NYC."}
{"text":"Crust never disappoints! Food is fresh and everything I have tried is absolutely delicious. Portion sizes are large, and last me a couple days! Love the roasted tomato gnocchi; sauce is honestly lick the bowl clean amazing. Yum!!! The Spaniard sub is my favorite sammie EVER!! Perfectly toasted and all the ingredients just melt together into perfection. Seriously, there is no comparison in Tremont!! I am super spoiled living a few blocks away from this place and just can't get enough of Crust!! Do yourself a favor and go here."}
{"text":"Definitely our favorite pizza place in Cleveland! We usually order a slice of pizza and add 1-2 toppings. DELICIOUS. And so cheap! One piece is HUGE and definitely filling.  They also always have different unique flavors of tiramisu which makes good dessert."}
{"text":"Super delicious New stork style pizza, friendly service, rustic atmosphere - first visit was a winner!  The Rustica pizza is just lovely!! I had the Palermo: so aromatic with a perfect thin crust and flavor bursting from the veggies! My husband loved his pineapple and sliced tomato Rustica, as well - especially the sauce.   The atmosphere is a little dark and really nicely decorated - you forget you're in a strip mall. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, rounding out the experience.  We can't wait to come back!! The menu is extensive. Next time, I'll save room for cannoli!  ***After many wonderful visits, updating this to 5 stars - their excellence stands the test of time ***"}
{"text":"Best. Gnocchi. Ever.  The roasted tomato ricotta gnocchi is only outshined by the butternut squash ricotta gnocchi. Both are full of intense flavor but with flavors that complement rather than compete. Just yummy."}
{"text":"Crust is the place to go if you're hungry for carbs in Cleveland.. especially if you live on the near West Side. Their pizza slices are huge, but what I recommend even more, are their delicious, gigantic, totally-filling sandwiches. Hot and cold options for meat lovers and vegetarians alike, Crust has a number of tasty options you should consider for lunch.. or whatever meal it is you're calling it.. you won't be hungry after!  I've eaten outside in the sun, but this is more of a stop in, order your sandwich and take it with you kind of place. Or call ahead. Not a fancy sit-down dinner."}
{"text":"Decided to return to Crust for their 2 slice lunch special for $6.50. Asked for Peperoni Slices with extra garlic and dried oregano. Had a draft beer as well while I waited almost 20 minutes for my slices. Unbeknownst to me, Peperoni, garlic and oregano were considered add ons by this restaurant and I was charged extra for these \"add ons \". The person who took my order never informed me of this. Since I was sitting at the bar when I received my check, I asked the worker who presented me with the check why I was being charged extra for things that no other restaurant would charge for. He gave a lame excuse, so I asked to speak to the manager. I explained the situation to him, but to no avail. He informed me that this was company policy and there was nothing he could do about it. The draft beer was also $8, and not even a foreign beer! I explained to him that I felt that his restaurant was taking advantage of the customer, but it seemed that the manager couldn't have cared less. Consumer BEWARE! If you decide to eat at Crust, be sure to ask if anything you order is considered an add on, which will be an add on charge. This place is a complete rip off. Not only was the pizza just average, IMHO, but the service is unimaginably slow. You might be better off buying a DiGiorno, and a six pack from Albertsons, and heating the pizza up yourself. You will save a lot of time and money. You might even prefer the frozen pizza over Crust's......at least you'll know what you're paying for and won't feel totally ripped off by people who don't give a damn about you."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for pizza and remembered this place tucked away on the side of a strip mall.  I had been meaning to try this place out for a couple of years and since it is my birthday week decided to head on over.  Parking was right in front and I entered through the door marked for \"to-go orders\" as that was what I planned on making.  This brought me straight into tables with the bar at the far end.  After reviewing the menu, which had all of the usual stars in a pizza place I decided upon a staple favorite, the margharita pizza.  What I got was anything but usual, however.  If you like a little bit of sauce brushed over texas sized toast with mozzarella medallions and a topping of your choice added, basil leaves on the side then this is the pizza joint for you.   Yes, I understand, I am lunching in an italian place named Crust which serves pizza.  It's not exactly the healthiest thing I could have done, but I was not expecting that.  It is sold as \"medium\" crust, penned just below their \"thin\" crust which I assume is what the pictures show.  I was expecting to get my pizza on, but the guilt has set in and I am covered in the familiar grease that I remember from the combination of pizza and texas toast.  If I go back it will be better informed and to order a thin crust.  Be warned.  The Medium crust is THICK and hard to cut.  Had a couple of pieces jump off my plate as I attempted to cut the stuff up.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it was worth the price, but I did get my money's worth. The staff was nice and prompt, however.  I can see how this place would be a popular choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service.  Came around noon on a thursday and there were 2 tables seated besides my table. The busser brought our waters and iced tea fairly quickly and then ten minutes later our server finally came to take our order.  So, we ordered a greek salad which came out pretty quickly and then we noticed that the two other tables got their pizzas right after we finished our salad. So another twenty minutes goes by and still no pizzas, finally after a half an hour our server came over and said there was a computer malfunction and that our pizzas would be there in the next ten minutes. Needless to say, the pizza was good which is why I gave it two stars. Other than that, I will probably never come back."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident, I was driving around Cleveland and needed to pull off the main road to look something up and we pulled in here and decided this would be a good place for lunch. I'm glad we went here as the pizza was great. They had 4-6 out and I got a slice from a couple of them and my wife got a couple slices too. The toppings were great, the crust was great, it was a good place to take a break for lunch."}
{"text":"When the owner comes by to apologize, I'ts not a good night. Service is slow, pizza is nothing special in a town with some good pie. It's also weirdly loud in there."}
{"text":"We stayed in Tremont for my birthday and this place was a short walk away.  We stopped by and it's a small mostly carryout pizza place, with a few small tables inside and a couple picnic tables outside.   We opted to get 1 slice each because they were advertised to be as big a small pizza and it was no joke!  The crust was delicious and they had a variety of toppings to choose from.  I worked in a pizzeria for many years so I consider myself a pizza snob at this one passed the test!"}
{"text":"Stop eating frozen pizzas!  No offense to Edison's or any other purveyor of pies, but Crust is hands down the best pizza in Cleveland. I come here on a regular basis now and want to break down their menu.   Pizza: Is there a better deal around than $3 for a slice the size of your face? You'd be hard pressed to find it. All of the pizzas are fresh, hand made, and come with a unique array of toppings (who doesn't love goat cheese and chorizo on a pizza). Each pie is well worth the price for the quality that you're receiving. The owners and workers are always super nice and willing to direct you in the right direction for what you're craving.  Pasta: Gnocchi, gnocchi, gnocchi. These little dough balls of love fill your stomach with warmth and feel like family. The roasted red tomato gnocchi brings full bodied flavor with a slight kick to their Parmesan broth, add chicken or meatballs and you have a meal that will keep you satisfied for hours and even days.  Subs: The best one is tough. Probably the Spanaird which includes goat cheese and chorizo or the Club which features their in-house smoked bacon. Did I mention the sub roll is homemade too? Nothing in this place tastes like it's packed with preservatives or has been sitting around.  Dessert: I don't know anyone that makes so many different types of tiramasu from bananas foster to white chocolate raspberry. I don't even like tiramasu and they got me hooked.  Ignore any preconceptions about what pizza should cost, it's well worth the quality and homemade feel to their establishment. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Came here with some friends the other day had two rusticas.  Had the palmero, and the MEAT.  Crunchy crust, nice fresh sauce, and really affordable. okay this phallic shaped pizza was delicious.   I hope I don't get yelp yelled at for this but i laughed when it came out.  I mean it's not even if you stretch your dirty mind you can see it I saw plainly two objects that resembled quite frankly a penis.  I checked out the pictures on the website and they look phallic but not the way they looked when i got them.   Maybe a good place to take a date to see how they would react to such a funny thing. Like see if they have a good sense of humor you know?  Also had the buffalo salad which was tasty as well.  Only weird thing was we got a bottle of malbec and the guy opened the bottle and then sniffed it before he poured it.  Which i think is odd, he's not drinking the wine why does he need to sniff the wine? I mean someone at the table is going to taste it to make sure it's bad so why you need to sniff it homie?? He was a really nice guy though I just thought that was odd."}
{"text":"Crust is still my favorite restaurant, every dish I try is great and the staff is very friendly - keep up the good work !!!!  Ray D. South Scottsdale"}
{"text":"They are completely correct in the name of this place because it is easily the best part of the pizza. I love everything else too, but it is evident that they really put a lot of work into dough! My favorite part is eating the soft crust of the pizza that has a little bit of salt sprinkled onto it.  I have to say that their customer service is superb as well. Recently, I ordered a pie from there on the way home from work. When we arrived, they were very apologetic that the pizza wasn't done because it the first one didn't come out perfect. As a way to apologize for an extra 7min wait, they offered to give us a few free pieces of dessert. We got a few pieces of specialty tiramisu and they were fantastic. I will continually recommend crust to anyone looking for Pizza in Tremont."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in here one day for lunch during the work week. I must say the shape of the pizza kinda threw me but still very good. I ordered the Blanco pizza which was very flavorful and will order it again.  The only thing that was disappointing was they only had one girl working the entire restaurant which made the wait for your food, drinks, check a bit longer than what I was expecting since this was during a weekday lunch where most people only have an hr for lunch.  Overall, it was very good and I will certainly be back again soon."}
{"text":"Crust is the best pizza I've ever eaten in the contiguous 48. Yes, we have many tasty wheels to choose from here in cleveland, but crust has taken it to a new level - gourmet. Quality ingredients and a reasonable price. And for you suburbanites, it travels and reheats extremely well. I love me some crust!"}
{"text":"Still one of my very favorite places on the planet. Their pies are so, so very delicious. If you don't like their pizza, I'm not sure I can trust you. I just... I can't.   I haven't tried too much else on their menu, but after reading through some of these reviews, I think we're going to have to try some sandwiches--and gnocchi. No more excuses.  But please, understand it's not easy to steer away from a pepperoni and mushroom pie from these guys... Topped with freshly grated cheese and chopped basil? Holy.   I love this place so much that I'll put up with the lack of seating. The lack of parking. I do not care. You shouldn't care. Just eat this pie and enjoy your life.   Oh, and try and dang salad! Those mothers are packed with stuff and delicious!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is real good but i recommend you eat at there location. I did takeout before and the pizza was oily and just not tasty like at their location. Also, I sat on the bar came really hungry, ordered an appetizer (bruschettas)  and the pizza and both took forever. I think the bar waitress forgot about us. She also got the order wrong thought it could be our fault, we wanted the square pizza not a full pie."}
{"text":"our first visit back in many years and the service has taken a turn for the better.   we were greeted upon arrival and were never left unattended for more than a few minutes. i'm not sure what his position was, but an extremely knowledgeable and friendly employee made suggestions, answered questions, and his love of wine was evident when interacting with the customers.   we only had a couple of glasses of wine, taking advantage of their excellent happy hour. they passed the water glass test with flying colors. and although we had dinner plans elsewhere, my mouth was watering at the sights and smells of their food. would love to re-visit for food and more drinks!"}
{"text":"Great food, warm atmosphere! Enjoyed the service, and the plating was well done. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Everything here is good! Trust me you cannot go wrong. My favorite is their Crusted Mac n' Cheese and their Mozzarella Encorozza appetizer....delish! A must try is the Vitamin V Martini, you won't be disappointed! If you're lucky enough to catch Mitch or Mike here be sure to thank them for opening up one of the best restaurants in AZ!  Don't forget to order the dessert pizza at least once in your life, ah-mazing."}
{"text":"First time to crust recently, and enjoyed their tomato gnocchi, Park salad, and caramel lady finger dessert. The gnocchi was perfect and the sauce had great flavor\zest. The salad was huge, tasty with greek olive,  sautéed onions, seasoned potatoes, feta, red peppers, tomatos, home made balsamic. The desert had a liquor in it that blended so well with the lady finger and caramel drizzle. All in all easy on the wallet, very pleased about that. Lastly, hosts were gracious,  passionate about their food. Bravo!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time not too long ago and it was delicious! Pretty good customer service and really good sangria to top it off. Will definitely go here again when I come back to AZ. The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that it was a little pricey. My tortellini pesto with chicken ended up being $18, way more than I thought it would be, but it was just so good"}
{"text":"This pizza blows everything that I've had in Cleveland out of the water. The crust is so fluffy yet crispy, the cheese perfectly melted, and cheese to tomato sauce ratio is just on point. When I first stepped into the store and saw the huge $3.00 slices as big as a toddler, I had my doubts about finishing it. However when I had my first bite, it was impossible to not take another bite of that gooey goodness and another...until I set a personal record on how much pizza I just consumed. This place is a MUST TRY."}
{"text":"Let's get one thing straight from the giddy-up.  I'm giving this restaurant one star because Yelp won't allow me to give it a big, fat zero.  The food was horrible.  No flavor whatsoever, and that goes for the calamari appetizer, the arugula and shrimp salad, and the eggplant parmesan pseudo-calzone.  My fellow diners and I had no choice but to slather the bland marinara sauce over everything , whether it belonged there or not.  Then, in a further attempt to make all three dishes edible, we had to bury every bite in grated cheese.  The salad required extra dressing to make it passable.  The economy stinks and people are being more careful with their money these days.  This place should be fined for serving \"food\" like this.  I wasn't the one who paid for this meal, but had I been, I would've read the manager the riot act and demanded that the dinner be free.  Honestly, it wasn't worth any price.  In a word, garbage.  I don't see how any of the other reviewers could like Crust.  Yes, it's always possible that the chef was having an off night.  But how do you screw up a friggin' salad?  How do you fry calamari wrong?  If the place is named Crust, aren't you the least bit embarrassed that your crust sucks?  Well, it does, and I'm embarrassed enough for both of us.  I just hope this food is better going out than it was going in.  Avoid, avoid, avoid."}
{"text":"YES YES YES!  Great pizza and it is all made from scratch in house!   I was visiting Cleveland to see my young nephew and thought this was a good place for him.  The seating area is not big at all, just 5-6 tables.  But, I loved that I could see into the kitchen and watched as they prepared everything right there!  The staff is really friendly.  They have pizza by the slice, which is one of the biggest slices you have ever seen!  One piece is enough for a meal and they will top is with whatever you like.  They also have made to order pies which are amazing!  The crust is the best part for me!  Its crispy and doughy and perfect! (The flatbread is also amazing bc it is....just crust!  They top it with parm cheese and red pepper flakes. yum!)   They have some amazing looking desserts, too.  But I was too full to try.  Will be visiting again, next time I am in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Great service.  I went to crust today and was surprised when I was given a large pizza box for two slices.  After I opened the box I understood.  Crust had the largest slices I have seen in sometime.  I loved the cured ham and the pepperoni,  the toppings were of premium quality. The crust was ok I prefer a softer sweeter crust . Overall the service was great abd the pizza was very memorable.  A Slice with one topping =$4 -5 but you will be full and possibly have some leftover."}
{"text":"Pizza:  Even their plain cheese pizza beats the fanciest topped pizza in town. Pasta: Roasted Tomato Gnocchi was excellent! Sub: Eggplant sub was wonderful. Salads: Fresh and Delicious. Dessert: If you come in time to get their home made tiramisu, get it! No other dessert compares! But the people - they make my experience every time I pick up dinner - they are beyond friendly!"}
{"text":"Today we sampled Crust. Here is the lowdown on the goods...  -Butternut Squash Ricotta Gnocchi: Thick and rich stick to your ribs deliciousness. Add a salad and you could definitely make this a hearty filling meal for two or four.  -The Spaniard Sub: The bread has a lovely softness to the inside and I enjoyed being able to taste the goat cheese right away.  -Capocollo Pizza: The thin crust is actually a bit thicker and chewier than I expected. In the first bite you immediately taste the saltiness of the cured ham and some heat from the red pepper flakes. I'd recommend sides of red sauce to aid in tastiness.  All in all, good grub."}
{"text":"Went to Crust's new location, and it looks great inside.  Very nice that it's located in same building as a bookstore.  Ordered a pizza, but wanted it vegan.  They were more than willing to accommodate requests.  Asked to leave off cheese and add arugula.  They did not charge us for the extra topping, since we'd left off the cheese.  Staff was attentive, but not overly so.  Pizza dough was very fluffy."}
{"text":"Ham on both pizzas I got were a bit salty but still yurning to love the pizza as much as others do here. Anymore suggestions?  Side note: the truffle cream with mushroom gnocchi with added chicken is amazing!! Like super fantastic trufflicious! We make sure to get it at least once a month even though we've moved out of Tremont- it's worth the trip!!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love Crust and frequent here often. They have amazing pizza, the Rustica is enough for two, and we usually split a salad. They have whole wheat crust, upon request, which is actually really good. There service is awesome and we always enjoy ourselves when we visit. They have a great wine selection by the glass and by the bottle. Our favorite is the red blend that is very unique, let it breathe though. They also have many flat screen tv's so you can keep up with what ever sporting event is on. The atmosphere is casual, but it can get noisy if the restaurant is full. The only time we've ever had poor food is when we do pick up. It's always been hit or miss then. We've never had a bad experience actually visiting the restaurant, which explains the 4 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"First time to Crust, a hip little hole in the wall pizza joint in the Tremont area of Cleveland.   Interesting menu, whole pizzas, salads, gnocchi, and subs. They also offer a pizza by the slice option, that starts with just cheese, and you can pick your own toppings for an extra $1-2 a topping.   Seeing as it was mine and the BFs first time here we opted for the pizza by the slice option. I added pepperoni, mixed mushrooms, and kalamata olives. He added capicola and roasted garlic.   Holy hell these were large slices! As another reviewer states \"one slice was bigger than my forearm\". For dinner I could probably have two, but for lunch one was great.   The crust for which the place is named was good. Crispy, but not dry. Strong enough to not bend, even with the length of the piece. Marinara sauce was tasty. Just enough cheese to compliment but not overwhelm. All in all a good pie.   Only reason Im giving this place a 4/5 rating is there is no customer bathroom. Which honestly sucks. But other than that? A great place I will for sure return too. I need to try some of their specialty pizzas."}
{"text":"Nice food and atmosphere.  Beer selection is weak.  Maybe they could buy more product from someone else than MillerCoors?"}
{"text":"We wanted super yummy pizza and we got it. Served up on wooden slabs, there's a few tables to eat in. They heated up pepperoni pizza slices for us and it was wonderful. Sauce was slightly sweet, crust was a little thin, needed a fork since the piece was so huge, and crust seasoned nicely. Lots of pepperoni and not too greasy."}
{"text":"Holy crap! I went back today for lunch and got the philly cheesesteak. It is literally the best sandwich I think I have ever had the pleasure of eating. This sandwich is punch a puppy in the face to get to the plate quicker good. I lack the words, but oh my... The bread, the wonderfully  tender meat, rosemary! Oy vey. Who cares if the salads lack veggies. Fuck veggies. Eat this sandwich! This may be the best thing in CLE right now"}
{"text":"Pizza slices BIGGER than anyone's head! Had a delicious pepperoni slice... they add a ton of fresh, hand sliced pepperoni to a waiting slice then pop it back into the pizza oven and bring it to you all hot and bubbly! Looking forward to trying a few of their specialty pizzas!"}
{"text":"I went to Crust with a group of friends on a weeknight. The ambience of the restaurant is fun but pretty tightly packed. I saw a gentleman with a walker literally not able to get around the tables to use the restroom. Our waiter was nice- other servers filled drinks and brought out our order. We were never told about any drink specials or what type of beer they have on tap until my fiancé asked, which was after we got our salads. One of my friends did not like the anti-pasta salad (I didn't try it) and they did take it off the bill. I was able to try Caesar salad with garlic bread, individual rustica pizza and a bite of the chicken parmigana meal. I liked everything I had- the shape of the pizza was the one thing that threw me off. If you haven't been, go check out this place just to see what I'm talking about. I took a picture and so did every table around us who ordered individual pizzas. I honestly wasn't blown away by the flavor of the food- it was good but not that good. I would probably come back but it's nowhere close to me so it would be for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Came for an early Fathers Day celebration. Very so-so. My pasta dish with meatballs and sausage was a nice large portion but it was so dry that I found very little sauce. My husband had the famous Mac and cheese with Chicken. Dry, dry, dry. He said boxed Mac N Cheese is so much better. Service was excellent but with the food, I will go elsewhere next time. Lots of great places in the area."}
{"text":"Glad I finally got to try crust, it was so worth it! I had the hot Margherita pepperoni and the four cheese pizzas. The pepperoni pizza was great and actually had bites of real spiciness but the chunks of tomato were perfect bursts of relief from the heat.  The four cheese pizza was great on a thin crust, and the schmear of roasted garlic was a perfect touch. it lended a creaminess that would have been lacking without a pizza sauce base (it's basically a white pizza).  I ate it again today as leftovers and it was still just as delicious. Had to control myself from finishing the rest of the slices. Bikini season coming up -____-  My only complaint and why I didn't give 5 stars is that I ordered two medium pizzas for $32. Granted the quality was great so I shouldn't complain (you could really tell the tomatoes were fresh), but it was pricier than I expected (because they were specialty pies). would've gave them a 4.5 if I could! Definitely going back hopefully soon"}
{"text":"What a find! Food was delicious and the service was fantastic.  We started with arancini, which was absolutely delicious...piping hot, flavorful, and a perfect portion size.  Our entrees were lasagna and chicken franchese. Generous portions and absolutely mouth watering!   Two thumbs up....and if I had more thumbs, they would be up, too."}
{"text":"I quite liked this place.  We went for a dinner with another couple.  Ordered a couple appetizers, a couple beers, a bottle of wine, large pizza and 2 entrees.  The bill was over 100 but not too crazy.  The service was great.  Do not underestimate the size of these pizza's!  They are huge!  And delicious!"}
{"text":"I would say a very solid neighborhood pizza joint.   The mushroom specialty pizza was quite good and the crust was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Kinda like a Subaru owner.  The Chicken Parm sub also had quality ingredients and good flavor.   And the babe-alicious brunette at the register was very cute.   What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Crust catered an event I hosted over the weekend.  I left a message on a Friday, received a call back within a few hours, worked with Jackie to place my order, and had a delivery (thanks Diana) at exactly the time I requested for my daughter's birthday party: 4:30 on Sunday.    Our group of 14 kids and approximately 20 adults enjoyed the following: *a meat and cheese plate *a half order of mac and cheese - no breadcrumbs *4 pizzas (2 plain, one pepperoni, one mushroom)  The food was served piping hot and it was delicious (by both kid and adult standards).  Crust also supplied some serving utensils, plates, plasticware, napkins, parmesan, red pepper flakes, etc... We had plenty of leftover food, and I have to say it all tastes just as good the next day!  I've been to this Crust location for lunch a couple of times, and I also recommend their salads.  I have yet to bring the family in for dinner, but I've heard great things about their pastas as well.  Can't wait to head in soon to check it all out first-hand.    Super pleased - thanks Crust!"}
{"text":"My 5 mo pregnant wife was in the mood for Pizza last night as was my 2 yr old daughter and I never shy away from a good pie.  The problem is that we struggle with good pizza joints outside of our usual spots (Red Devil, Oregano's & NYPD).  Oregano's and NYPD were slammed because of bike week so we stumbled upon Crust as we eat Sushi next door and figured we'd give it a shot.   The place is quaint and nicely decorated.  They have a great little bar, a decent selection of beer and a good wine selection.  I ended up having a couple cold Peroni's and a glass of the house chianti.  They also have some nice flat screens so I was able to watch the Dbacks & the NBA playoffs (always a plus in my book).  Our server & service was great and the food was even better.  We started with a cesar salad which came in a fresh \"pizza crust\" bowl.  It's hard to mess up a cesar but this one was really good, lots of freshly grated parmesan cheese & dressing and hand made croutons.  Obviously we ordered pizza, fresh mozzarella, tomato & basil with pepperoni and sausage.  The pizza was excellent and the thin crust was amazing.  They are brick oven pies and they cool and unique thing is they bring you out half of the pie first and then second half when your ready which assures it's always fresh out of the oven.    We'll definitely come back!  If you're up in that area (Indian Bend & Hayden) you should check it out!  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Crust pizza is one of the best we've ever had.  Typical New York style...big slices...delicious sauce and sausage....and the CRUST is amazing!"}
{"text":"I traveled to AZ for a soccer tournament and we needed to cater a meal for three of the teams which were staying at a nearby restaurant.  I found Crust Restaurant and communicated with Mike & Mitch (the two partners) about our meal and needs and they were very accomodating.    The size of our group was originally going to be about 70 people and the amount of food provided was plenty for what ended up being closer to 80 and a BIG hit for the families traveling with us.  The process was so convenient that we called back the next night on short notice and ordered 10 large pizza's hoping he would be able to help us out again and again the service and accomodations they made were beyond expectations.  The pizza were another hit with the families.  I will definitely keep these guys in mind next time we head out to the Scottsdale/Phoenix area.  Thanks Guys!"}
{"text":"The Finocciona pizza was not as good as the last time I had it....  both our pizza's were a little skimpy.... but it was still a nice indulgence.   : )   I will keep going back!"}
{"text":"This place really does live up to its name, And if you're a crust guy like me that's a positive. Shared some medium Margherita (hand-tossed) with a buddy and it was excellent. I'm usually not as big a fan because I'm also a pizza sauce guy (when it's done well), but this was well done down to the fresh basil.  The prices are reasonable and they have pasta, salad, and sandwich options as well that sound delicious. I took off some credit for the limited eat-in seating. If you're not going to offer it, I feel like you should set up like Valentino's in Little Italy, and maybe just offer a few seats outside when the weather is permitting.  Overall though, this place is a really worth a stop in Tremont. I'm glad I did."}
{"text":"Crust, I'd give you 6 stars if I could.  It was a Saturday night and a large group (14) got together for a birthday dinner in Tremont. Our first choice restaurant didn't end up working out and we were playing a frantic game of \"let's call every other restaurant in the area\" to figure out wait times. 2 hours. 3 hours. Nope nope nope. Then I had the brilliant idea of heading to Crust (I\"m so good). I was worried we'd be standing around since it's such a tiny place but it worked out WONDERFULLY. The guys were super accommodating and let us put several tables together. They explained all the menu items and which pizzas were vegetarian or could be made veggie. We took up the entire seating area, but no one minded. To top that off, they brought out silverware and cups of water for everybody and our pizzas came out hot and fresh and at the same time. Of course I don't need to comment on the pizzas - they're freakin' delicious. We all shared slices of the butternut squash (my favorite), lemon rosemary chicken (potatoes on a pizza - cause carbs on carbs is the best), Spanish chorizo (with goat cheese and red peppers), and hot margherita pepperoni. It ended up being a really fun night. Thank you, Crust!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid pizza, definitely a different taste. Really liked the garlic salt on the crust. Definitely recommend for it to be added to your rotation of pizza places in the OC/Tremont area."}
{"text":"I've been getting slices here a couple times a month since they opened the St. Clair location, but today tried a Sub for the first time.  I ordered the Mediterranean Chicken with goat cheese and it was undoubtedly one of the best subs I've ever had in my life.  Definitely take them up on toasting it in the pizza oven as the exquisite bread tastes like the monks just pulled their heavenly creation out of the oven and placed it directly in your mouth.  Soft, flavorful with substance.  The marinade on the chicken along with the house made Italian dressing have strong zest for flavor and to add to your life.  The calamata olives and roasted red peppers taste like my grandmother was making my sandwich and demanding \"manga!\" as I heartily chomped it down.  Absolutely wonderful.  Can't wait to try other varieties.  No need for a side with this."}
{"text":"Great fresh italian food and super friendly staff. While waiting for carryout they offer a water or other beverage, which is nice. I recommend the pastas and pizzas and vino."}
{"text":"Okay, yeah, totally bumping this one up to five stars.  I went back here today with two friends and we each got a different pizza so we could share.  Oh. My. God.  The pizza was just as good as the gnocchi.   Go.  Go now."}
{"text":"I've always heard good reviews about Crust so, I had to come & check it out.  The restaurant is very small so, I wouldn't recommend having a large party for dining in. They have a huge pizza at the counter that they sell by the slice so, we opted for just getting a slice. Took about 10mins to get our slices. The slice is huge! I mean...huge. One slice was plenty. The pizza tasted pretty good. I liked the cheese, the sauce, & the slight crispy-ness from the crust. I actually thought there was too much crust for me. The pizza would be even better with a thinner crust. I wasn't completely blown away from the pizza. Would I come back? Yes. I would probably get a whole pizza time though."}
{"text":"Just went for the first time for lunch with my mom. Had the bruschetta board and the meat and cheese board. Both very good. Friendly servers and nice atmosphere. Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"I liked it even though the sauce has a hint of something spicy like jalapeño or whatever.  Would like an option of a plain sauce.  Service was excellent, pizza a little undercooked but better than anything we get in El Paso, TX.  The butter cake was yummy.  I would return to try some other offerings.  And, the Cabernet was delish!"}
{"text":"This place is okay for happy hour. The prices are too high for what it is otherwise, so get there and order before 6. I had a small caprese salad that was delicious, but the meat and cheese board was lacking flavor. The toast was well done, but the meats and cheeses chosen were all mild flavored. It could have also used some mustard or fig jam (or both! ) to get something with moisture on the board and to cleanse the palate. The atmosphere is nice and the wait staff is friendly.  Maybe if I had chosen something different to eat . . ."}
{"text":"Crust has the BEST Greek salad, very fresh and served in a baked bread bowl. Fast, friendly service. We didn't stop in the other day because they were blasting music, but it's not usually loud. Hopefully it will be quiet the next time. Still, I highly recommend Crust in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Great pizza rustica. I liked the New York style with extra cheese and pepperoni. Mike and Mitch are great guys so I like coming. The sliders oh hh are good too."}
{"text":"We went here tonight for the first time for my fiance's birthday dinner. Were seated right away and got to choose a table. Started with a glass of wine each, caesar salad to share, and then he ordered the Uncle Lou's individual pizza, and I opted for the Duke's (Hawaiian) individual pizza. Yummy! The pizzas were huge and we both went home with 2-3 slices for leftovers. The wine is good, and they have $5 glasses until 6pm.  What got me to 5 stars with them was their service and above and beyond customer service. On the way back from the restroom, I asked the waitress if she could put a candle in the dessert that we had just ordered. She said that she wasn't sure they had any candles left, but she would check. About 5 minutes later, I noticed the manager (who had earlier come up to us to introduce himself and see how everything was) walking back into the restaurant holding a pack of candles. He had gone out to buy some! I was blown away (pun intended) and really impressed. He did not inform me that he ran out to get candles, rather he just took care of it and went the extra mile.   I really appreciated that and am happy to give them my stamp of approval. Two thumbs up. The food and service here is hard to beat. Thank you, Crust, for making our dinner a memorable one!"}
{"text":"Nice suprise. Stopped for quick lunch. Wood oven smell filled the room. Nice to see a Greek salad on the menu. It was cleverly presented inside of a pizza crust. Hence the name. Warm and perfectly toasted crust brushed with oregano and evoo. Added the antipasta. To make it...\"now that's Italian\". Very friendly bartender/ owner. Will be back."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area and decided to try this place. When I walked in, it took a while to get service. I had to walk to the bar area to get someone's attention. I am just going to assume that it's because I went in between lunch and dinner.  The pizza...was delicious!  I ordered an Eggplant and Garlic Pizza with a side salad. The crust was thin and had great texture; the sauce was flavorful. The eggplant was thinly sliced (not overly thin, but just right) and spread throughout the pizza along with fresh mozzarella, fresh garlic, and basil.   The side \"Crust Salad\" was just okay (half of it was iceberg lettuce) and a bit pricey for what you get.  I will certainly be back to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"So i have had this place bookmarked FOREVER and still havent offically went to this restaurant. BUT i was at taste of tremont yesterday and this vendor was one of my fav's  First off i want to say that \"the mom\" as she called herself, gave my friend and i a sample of the gnocchi and it was delish!! the pizza looked insanely amazing as well which solidified my want and NEED to visit the actual restaurant :)"}
{"text":"I love Pizza.  It's one of my weaknesses.  This place serves up good Pizza and other items as well.  On Mondays they have 1/2 off bottles of Wine.  Bottles are as cheap as $15, how can you beat that?!  Over several trips, we've tried the following menu items:  Filet Mignon Sliders, $12.95 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=qemac_ZxOffI83Ws9agJLw#qemac_ZxOffI83Ws9agJLw  Big Boy Sandwich (Ham, Salami, Prosciutto, Sopressatta, Provolone & Roasted Peppers drizzled with Extra Virgin Olive Oil & Balsamic Vinegar), $8.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=MKWlE4L9T77hBmnXF6oObA#MKWlE4L9T77hBmnXF6oObA  Spinach & Artichoke Dip, $10  Fried Calmari, $11  20\" Uncle Louie Pizza (Sausage, Pepperoni, Marinated Tomatoes, Fresh Mozz, Basil), $22.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=kFnaro35eDVgQarSvw-x9Q#kFnaro35eDVgQarSvw-x9Q  Rollatini \"Calzone\" (Sausage, Peppers, Onions, Ham, Salami, Sopressata & Mozzarella), $8.50  My favorite is the Uncle Louie.  The 20\" is a huge Pizza that can easily feed 3 to 4 people.  I love how they use Fresh Mozz instead of the regular Cheese you find at most Pizza joints.  Their Sauce is also very good here.  For lunch, the Rollatini or \"Calzone\", Big Boy Sandwich, and Filet Sliders hit the spot....you can't go wrong with any of the 3.  Overall, this is one of our fav dining spots in the area.  Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"Everyone here was super nice! I got the penne ala vodka and it was so delicious. I noticed that they have a variety of specials throughout the week. Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Crust is named crust for a reason.  All of the ingredients are fresh (they even sprinkle fresh basil on top of the slices) when you bite into a slice, the bottom is perfectly crunchy crispy, while the middle part of the pizza is perfectly doughy.  This pizza doesn't upset your stomach (like most of the other local shops do) the employees are unbelievably friendly and grateful you're doing business with them.  From the cheese, to the sauce, to the crunchy, doughy crust this pizza is - hands down - one of the best I've had in some time.  $3 for a slice of cheese, there's no excuse not to try it! Y U M"}
{"text":"Wonderful pizza, great atmosphere, pretty good beer selection!  And...great CANNOLIS, I was very pleasantly surprised and cannot WAIT to go back here."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a great pizza place on the west side for a few Months now and I have finally found one I enjoy. We got the hot margarita pepperoni and it was delicious! Be warned though, the garlic sauce is in place of tomato sauce.   The ingredients as well as the dough were high quality and fresh and you could not ask for more (besides delivery)! I will be ordering from here again and trying the thin crust also!"}
{"text":"Individual slices are huge!  Many different toppings to choose from.  1 slice and a Coke and I'm full.  Good crust and sauce. Well done!"}
{"text":"Garlic knots, calamari, pizza, chicken Marsala, paninis... All to die for! Full bar along with a great wine list. Friendly staff. They play good music. Zero complaints!"}
{"text":"Very unique pizzas.  One that we got had bacon bits on it!  The pesto cream sauce could have been better for the pasta. Service was also pretty slow. Overall an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Solid, if unspectacular pizza pie. I had the mixed mushroom with goat cheese, caramelized onions and balsamic vinegar. Favorite part was how the sweetness of the caramelized onions and cooked garlic mingled with the salty goat cheese and acidity of balsamic vinegar. The crust was also tasty, which maybe shouldn't be surprising given the name of the place. I usually don't eat the crust, but these I happily ate given the nice garlic salt seasoning.  Would go again, just wouldn't seek it out specifically."}
{"text":"It was a Saturday night and we'll my family wanted Italian and what do I do??? I go on yelp try to find some really yummy Italian food that has a little bit of everything for all of us. So we arrived and it wasn't busy at all  we were told we could sit wherever we like open seating so me and my family sat down and ordered some water and appetizer of garlic knots(no spicy please). So we look over the menu our kids got a plain cheese pizza and our nephew got a meatball pizza.  Zero complaints from the kids the pizza was great. But yet they are kids and all kids love pizza. My mom ordered the pasta in clam sauce. It was \"OK\" she said which really means it was gross because well we're form NJ/NYC we're picky when it comes to Italian food(pretty sure I've said this before). My husband ordered the pasta carbonara which seemed to be very watery lacking in a ton of flavors. He was so upset bc he loves carbonara and for it to be as bland is that he was so disappointed. Also they forgot the check he had to tell our waiter. I had the penne alla vodka and that was ok but not the best I've ever had. Was this dinner work $90 omg nope not at all. Will he come back? I'm sure we won't. What's the point of eating Italian food if it has no flavor?!? I want flavor in every bite. So you want flavor don't waste ur time go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We just returned from dinner at Crust.  This is a wonderful small rustic/style restaurant specializing in authentic Italian food, with top notch pizza.  And right in our neighborhood! The service was great, the freshness and quality of the food was impressive, and I loved the unique presentation of the pizza.  Somebody has paid attention to detail and it shows.  The hand stretched pizza is served on a wood board and is an elongated shape.  The crust is fantastic--crisp and chewy.  The pizza sauce is very fresh tasting with just the right amount of salt and garlic seasoning.  We had the original pizza with basil, small medallions of mozzarella, and sauce.  We added black olives and mushrooms.  We also split a Tuscan arugula salad which had white beans on top.  The salad is presented on top of a lovely baked bread bowl.   It was perfect.  Our well trained waiter recommended the butter cake with vanilla ice cream---this was one of the best desserts I've had at any restaurant.  A rich buttery cake, moist and dense with a wonderful buttery flavor.   The overall experience was 5 star; we will be back."}
{"text":"Oh I actually ended up liking this place a lot. Not salty, not heavy, and left wanting more.  Order the carbonara no peas AND the bolognese. Start with the calamari cause you need to start with fried.  That's all i need to say...and that I'm coming back to try all the pastas and desserts."}
{"text":"Blonde Bombshell Rustica xtra crispy.   (We minus mushrooms,add onions/garlic).  MUST TRY!    This is one of the reasons Crust is a weekly staple.   Another recommendation you ask...? Meatball Sliders- YUM!  Buratta- YES!!"}
{"text":"Pizza sauce tasted good. Pizza was really good! Hand stretched dough. Gave 4* because the pizza was good and it is a pizza place after all. However: Menus were filthy - please make sure these get cleaned and stay clean! Macaroni and cheese was gummy, not creamy, my child ate a little. I tried the macaroni and was not impressed, think it might have been frozen. Would have been way better fresh, but we came at lunchtime - maybe they only do fresh Mac at dinner? I left my wallet here with $250 cash and debit cards and realized it two hours later. I called, they had the wallet. All contents were included in the wallet when I picked it up. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizzas made with care and tremendously fresh ingredients.  The stuffed banana pepper pizza is a must try!"}
{"text":"I like this place. It was my second time there and this time I ventured past the awesome pizza.  That is why it only gets 4 stars.  The mac and cheese was like easy mac, baked.  Not impressive at all.  The other dishes were great, Caesar salad and Bella Rosa pizza.  So, stick to the pizza, which is fantastic and you'll love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! Knowledgable and friendly staff. My friend recommended I stop by and I am glad I did! The food and atmosphere are terrific as well. True Italian! I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Omg I am pretty sure I can't live without their pizza. It is a work of beautifully functional art! I had mine with kalamata olives, roasted tomato, and fried egg. He got extra cheese. Our slices were HUGE- they really are about 1 pound, maybe more with toppings. Somehow, despite how large the slices are the crust remained crunchy, chewy, and perfect. We will be back."}
{"text":"Happy Hour specials on Mon-Tues; half off bottles of wine. Service was spot on!"}
{"text":"Have been enjoying Crust since it opened about 2 years ago. The pizza is very good!! Comes in a cute eiffel tower shape. The deserts are awesome and you can take them to go!! The wine selection is pretty small but they are choice bottles without being overpriced! The owners are very laid back but its a fun little small place."}
{"text":"We stop here since my little one wanted to have pizza. It is right next to Sakana, Japanese restaurant. Yelp location is bit weird, so google it if u dont know where it is. We ordered calamari as appy and it was quite good except it was bit salty. We were bit skeptical at first since we were the only people when we walked in. I guess it was cause it was around 3pm. For our main, we ordered 'Jersey style' and pamelro. Both of these pizza were huge even though it was individual size. The Jersey style which is supreme pizza was thin and very flavory. The pamelro? was very unique with its freshness. So if u r pizza lover, u better try here. Our server was nice and the manger or theowner was checking on us making sure everything was ok."}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer that the general worthiness of pizza can be judged by a pepperoni slice. Nothing more, nothing less. Pepperoni is a standard topping, probably the most common. Cheese, dough and sauce are the other stars of the show. The few toppings leave limited room for error. Yet, as you can probably infer from my 2 star rating, I was left underwhelmed by Crust.  Let me preface; this isn't an attempt at  being a contrarian to the other glowing reviews. It's just me being brutally honest as I always am. Being that my opinion differs from just about everyone else, I'm left wondering how I came away with such a stark difference of opinion? What do others taste that I don't? Is this another case of sheep following a herd? Or am I the one who's wrong? Let's examine...  Let's me begin by stating that I really wanted to like this place. The owner seems nice. I'm told he's \"passionate\" about pizza. They had like 8 people working on a Saturday night despite us being the only one in the place and it being about 1/8th the size of my garage. It's a cute place. I hope they succeed. After all, they're just another small business trying to make it in this unforgiving world. And now that the newness has worn off, I suggest it's time to take off the kid gloves.  I love pizza and I was starving since I skipped lunch that day. A pepperoni slice was needed to quell my hunger. Yes the slices were huge. Yes the pepperoni slices were thick. The cheese shredded to order. The sauce --I'm told-- made from scratch. Yet none of this matters if the final product is bland or in the case of the sauce, overly seasoned. My biggest issue with Crust was the sauce. It was a simple red sauce. Yet I tasted garlic for 2 days afterwards. I don't know if this was a mistake or what, but it was crazy garlicky. And I'm a huge fan of garlic. On occasion, I've been known to roast an entire bulb and spread it on toast. I'm no stranger to the root veg. But this sauce? It screamed of \"gah-lick\". Emeril wouldn't even approve.   Next up? The dough/crust. Let me try and describe the method of how they create the crust: Let's say you order a 12\" pie. They roll it out to a 16\" in diameter, then roll the outside of the dough inward about 2\" all the way around. You're left with this massive rope of unevenly cooked crust. And it's not even stuffed with cheese or anything. Odd, but a trademark of theirs I suppose. Overall, the dough and crust was completely unmemorable and bland.  Final verdict? Sorry folks, but Crust seems like a Bust."}
{"text":"We strolled in at 8:40pm on a Saturday night and staff was nice and friendly. I didn't feel the annoying eye rolls of us coming in so close to close. We ordered a medium four cheese pizza on regular crust and it really hit the spot. Delicious from the bread to the cheese, to the oil, to the spices. I'm kinda bummed that I've been in Cleveland for a year and a half now and I JUST found this place. Ah well, I'll make up for lost time!  I wanted to go back today for a sub, but alas, it is Sunday and they are closed."}
{"text":"Oh Crust, I love you. The restaurant is officially my new favorite pizza place. From the decor, to the pizza and pasta aroma, to the friendly staff, Crust did not disappoint. After 10 minutes of weighing the pizza toppings options I settled on a slice of arugula, pepperoni, and mozzarella. It was so yummy! After taking the first bite I wanted to order pizza toppings go."}
{"text":"This is a must eat while in Cleveland! I ordered the cheese with white truffle oil. Absolutely delicious! Anything with truffle oil is already a win. The size of the slice is no joke. The only time a knife and fork is okay with pizza! Next time we are in town, we will deff be back for more!!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing! We have not  found one item on the menu that we did not care for! And the service matches that amazing taste! Michael, our repeated server, has always gone above and beyond our expectations! He's friendly, funny and on point with his service (regardless of how crazy busy it gets). And Tim, the manager, is always very welcoming before, during and after our visits! The chefs know how to cook! Kudos to chef Alex Redmes for making juicy steaks and the best Italian food we've ever had! We love the delicious food, we love the service...we just love this place!"}
{"text":"My boss at Nordstrom told me about this place. He was told by the owner of the Chicago Cubs who always makes  a point of coming in when visiting Scottsdale. I have been coming here ever since. The food is very good and I'm a tough critic as I am from New York.  Great Happy Hour and consistently great food!"}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled across crust today when in to eat. I have to say that the atmosphere was fantastic their food and price was wonderful I would definitely recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"My family's first time to Crust (we stumbled on it - wife spotted it). Trundled the kids in, and lo and behold - Free WiFi signs about! YES! I said, running back to car for laptop. I fired up YouTube for the kids while wife and I had a chance to meet and greet one another again. \"Hi dear, who are you?\" and \"You look terrific? Where have I met you before?\"  Service started a bit slow, but waters and drinks came around and then our family medium crust pie later - I loved it, wife said Yeah! and the kids were quiet, glued to video clips and my son ate a bunch of Crust pizza.   The Rustica thin crust pizza  seemed to be the Crust calling card, so we;ll have to try those next time too. Well done! And we didn't even try any wine! But next time we're in the hood, we will."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! I'm not really sure what else to say about it. It's good. And tasty and I wish I had it right now, but I don't and that makes me sad. But the pizza made me happy. It's not really your typical pizza, more artisan (is that a thing?), but it's worth the trip to Lakewood."}
{"text":"We loved the thin crust prosciutto specialty pizza here. Really amazing pizza, I was impressed by the kitchen- they make EVERYTHING from scratch. It's mostly a take-out place, though... I hope they are successful and can expand into a cozy little restaurant with wine to go with the great pizza!"}
{"text":"I'm fascinated by Crust's menu. Their specialty pizzas are really inventive. Is it a possible for a pizza place to be \"cool\"? That's what I think of when I think of Crust. When you look at the menu, you'll just be thinking how good everything looks.  We ordered the Lemon Rosemary Chicken pizza, which comes with primarily garlic roasted potato, chicken, mozzarella, feta, rosemary, and tomato. The potato is really the dominant flavor on this pizza, which caught me off guard a bit. I think next time we'll try a different flavor, but my friend really enjoyed it. I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention how absolutely fresh the ingredients were. I really love that they are a 100% scratch kitchen. As their menu explains, nothing comes pre-made.   It was also awesome that their crust was in fact, delicious. How sad would it be if a place called Crust didn't have edible crust! These days, I can get really overwhelmed with the number of pizza places in the area. But Crust is a place i'm willing to try again! We had leftovers for days. It's hard not to be a fan."}
{"text":"After my first review the owner responded and wanted to know why my experience was poor and invited me in for a free meal. I went in tonight without him knowing because I didn't want them to try and impress me. My service was prompt and the pizza was good. They have Stella on tap which I don't find often so that started the meal off great. I got the Goddaughter rustic pizza which was pretty damn good. Their pesto is certainly unique and tasted different than most pesto which is a good thing. The owner was there and I called him over to introduce myself as the guy that wrote a negative review. I offered to pay because it wasn't about a free meal, but he insisted on comping my meal.   The place was packed, unlike my last visit, and I had great service. My first bad experience must have just been an off night for the staff and they certainly have gotten my business back."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!   We had intended to go to Sakana Sushi and the wait time was 40 minutes. We saw Crust next door and decided to give it a try.   Finally, we had the dining experience we have been looking for. From the service to the flawless food, we had an amazing time. This is the best Italian we have found in Scottsdale.   The strip mall does not serve Crust at all, it is truly the diamond in the rough. Everything is fresh, creative and mouth watering.   We had the spinach and artichoke dip for our appetizer. Best EVER!   I had the special, linguine with clam sauce and Jason had the meatball parm calzone. Have you ever seen the movie Ratatouille? Well we felt like the food critic at the end enjoying the speechless, delicious meal.   We ended our meal with the special, cookies and cream cheese cake. Ladies, this is not one of those desserts where you can eat a couple bites and leave the rest to your man ... it is so delicious we were fighting each other for the last bite.   Their drink selection is marvelous. Jason had the key lime pie martini. It was like none other. It was key lime to the core and they even included the pie crust crunch.   The service was watertight. I have never seen such a hard working staff. They helped each other out, glasses were always full and extremely willing to provide anything needed at every table.   I can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times and this place is consistently good. I can only rate the pizza here since it's the only item that I've had but its DELICIOIUS. My favorite is The Meat, its just a pizza with pepperoni and sausage, but still amazing. We just happen to get there during happy hour and were delighted to find out that all apptizer and drinks from the bar were all half priced. YAY! In addition to this, the service was very good. Our waitress didn't check on us too often and was always there when we needed something, whether we knew it or not, haha.   The only cons for this place is that is can be hard to find if you've never been there and hard to give directions to friends if you're meeting with someone there since it's in a shopping center and off in a corner. The other con is that you might be in for a wait for your food but that's only because they make them fresh, so it's definately worth it. Oh, I almost forgot! Most of, if not all, of the people working there said \"goodbye\" when we left, which is an awesome little thing to do. I'm not sure if they do this when that get busy too but the fact that they did it at all was a nice touch."}
{"text":"Get \"The Skinny Guy\" it's off the menu and SO good. It's an oven roasted panini with grilled chicken and eggplant on mozzarella, spinach and tomato. Oh.My.Gosh!! I get this to go all the time. It's awesome :)"}
{"text":"Crust is a great local place.  The service is well timed as well as a fine wine list and tasty appetizers.  We always return and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"I'm giving Crust 3-stars because I think they have the makings of an amazing pizzeria, but to those claiming this is NY-style or great pizza, I think we live in different realities. I've had great NY pizza, even in places other than NY, and this was pretty mediocre.  I got a regular slice of cheese (slices in CLE?!) for lunch and from a distance it looked amazing. The slice was giant and and had pretty nice proportions of cheese, sauce, and crust. That's where the good news ends. The pizza just didn't work flavor wise; I can't quite articulate what it was, but it didn't taste good. The crust rim was way too big. The underside of the crust wasn't golden and had some black char on it. The crust also had some sort of garlic flavoring, which threw me off. Good dough shouldn't need flavoring.  I think if they fix some of their execution, it could be a really great pizza joint. I think maybe the ovens aren't heating correctly and the dough recipe needs some tweaks. Just my 2 cents; definitely check it out for yourself."}
{"text":"Crust serves, hands down, some of the best pizza I've ever eaten, in any city, period. Their butternut squash specialty pizza (bacon, blue cheese, butternut squash, caramelized onions, & a balsamic reduction) handily replaces D.C.'s Pizzeria Paradiso's Genovese as my favorite gourmet pizza, which is lucky, since I live in Cleveland now, not D.C.... But seriously, this pizza will blow your mind - both sweet & savory, so flavorful. I also love that they make everything from scratch. This isn't shitty frozen pizza; this is pizza made with love.  So why only four stars? I am reeeeally not enamored of Crust's set-up, which is more like a late-night jumbo-slice joint on a college campus than a real restaurant. They've got a couple small tables inside & four tables on a (lovely) patio outside, for when the weather is nice, but overall, this is the sort of place where you're probably getting your food to go... even though they don't deliver. I don't know about you, but I want to enjoy a gourmet pizza as soon as it's served, not after I've run out to pick it up & brought it back to my place to find it lukewarm & already borderline congealing.  Also, I've not found the staff here (at least the front counter staff) to be particularly friendly, AND they don't have a restroom for customer use, which adds to the walk-in/walk-out vibe that I already don't love. That pizza is enough to give it four stars (the food alone is worth five), but I wish Crust was aspiring to something bigger than a hole in the wall with a walk-up counter & grumpy staff. I just think that, food-wise, Crust is a lot better than it's setting itself up to be, location-wise, & that bums me out.  But the butternut squash pizza? Go get it, ASAP."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! I had the rigatoni pesto with shrimp, my mother had the tortellini, and my aunt had a pizza. We all enjoyed our food and I would recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"I love this place!! I've been here 3 or 4 times now and have never been disappointed! So far, we've tried the rusticas, the thin pie, the mozzarella encorozza (have to get it!) and even the Club sandwich!! Everything has been delicious!! In addition to the great food, the service couldn't be better either - our servers have been friendly, courteous and always ask how everything was. Not to mention, I've seen each of the owners back behind the bar serving customers as well! It's a good place for pizza and you're not compromising anything in return!! Go already!"}
{"text":"So, the first two times we got pizza from here I raved how it was my new favorite pizza joint. In particular the lemon rosemary chicken pizza. But, after the last two orders, my mind has done a 180. We had ordered a few pizzas different times with neighbors this Summer and every time ending disappointed. The pizza tasted...different, and not in a good way. I'm not even sure how to describe it. I just know, I won't be back, at least for a long time unless coerced...."}
{"text":"Although I gave their pizza 3 stars, this establishment has one of the best salad's in the city of CLE. When I say great...I mean great, and you can tell that all of the produce is fresh and brought in from somewhere local. The flavors pop in your mouth, and if you feel a little carnivorous, have them add some chicken or sausage to your salad. The customer service is always great too, so I really felt bad about leaving a 3 for the pizza, which didn't include my entire experience at this place. The owner (or manager...I'm not sure) always greets you with a smile and wants to ensure that your visit is a good one. My co-workers are all hooked on the salads here, and will often send me on runs to Crust."}
{"text":"I love coming to Crust!  The atmosphere and the food are super homey and comforting.  I recommend the spinach dip (comes out piping hot and cheesy from the woodfire oven) and The Meat (pepperoni and sauge) rustica.  YUM!!  Also, I am super obsessed with their marinara sauce!!  Luckily, they sell it by the jar so I can take a little of their Italian magic home with me. :)"}
{"text":"We ate at Crust recently and loved it so much! I had the Rustica pizza and I ate enough to be thoroughly stuffed and still had leftovers for lunch the next day. My husband had the stromboli rollatini and it was delicious. He asked to add olives but since they pre-roll the strombili they were nice enough to add the olives on the side. The ambiance is great with a fantatic wine selection. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"While visiting the area, we went to Crust for lunch.  Lunch time was actually pretty empty, but the place has a nice feel to it.  The service was very good and our waitress, Noelle, was really helpful and took very good care of us.  I found a mobile coupon online for $10 off, and although I should have printed the coupon out ahead of time she was still able to get me the discount.  The salad I had was very good and I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Holy slices this place is good!!!   You walk in, there's 3-4 ginormous pizzas on the counter ready for you to pick your toppings and bake them on. You can order by the slice or order a whole pizza. You can order whatever toppings you want by the slice.   You would think that a premade pizza that has been sitting for awhile probably wouldn't be that great, but you're wrong. You're so wrong.   We ordered by the slice and I opted for spinach and meatballs. They gave me a sample of their tiramisu while I waited. Heavenly!!! Pick a table and they bring out to you a foot long slice of pizza. Seriously, these slices are huge.   They brought our little (big) slices of heaven out on wooden blocks. The first bite was as good as the last. I rarely eat the crust on pizza but I joyfully finished every bite - not right away as there was enough for me to bring some home. We had neighborhood Pizza Cat, \"Yeppers,\" visit us as we were eating and happily shared some cheese with him.   The only thing I would change is if I was ordering by the slice again, I probably would get just plain cheese. The toppings cost more than the slice itself, and I didn't really think the meatballs were anything special at all. They didn't really taste or look like meatballs even. It was still amazing.   Next time I want to order our own personal pizza so I can try it all fresh out of the oven. Overall this is my new favorite pizza place in the area. It might even be better than Angelo's. It's definitely better than Edison's."}
{"text":"What an excellent surprise.  This place is about as good as a small neighborhood spot can aspire to be.  I grabbed eight different pies for a group and they all loved them.  Excellent choices and super fresh just like they say.  My favorite was definitely the Prosciutto followed closely by the Mixed Mushroom.  Thank you for an excellent pizza."}
{"text":"OMG this place! We used to live about a mile away and it is still such a great treat! Two words: ESPRESSO MARTINI. Do it.  Food?! Where do I start? Th salads in the bread bowls,  the filet mignon sliders, ALL the pasta dishes, and the giant pizza slices! The atmosphere is casual but classy. My kiddo was so comfortable one night, he fell asleep in the booth!!!!  It's a great place for a date night warm up. An espresso martini and an appetizer, and you're good to go!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the definition of a hidden gem! Nestled in a strip mall, this cute little place will leave you delighted and stuffed!   The extensive menu offers heaping portions and endless options. I've had their eggplant entree, greek salad, artichoke dip, pizza, etc. and I have no complaints about a single one of them! Everything is fantastic!   I even took my incredibly picky parents to this place and they've been back 4 or 5 times...now that's truly telling of the place."}
{"text":"You can't get a hold of anyone that works here, no one picks up the phone. They have an auto answer that is obviously old because it mentions reopening in July. If you go to the locations like I have... they are closed for varying reasons during times they should be open. (Twice now)"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.  Their pizza is delicious and has the best crust, especially the individual pizza's (rusticas).  They also have amazing sliders.  I have yet to go wrong with any thing I have ordered from Crust.  The ambiance is great, as well as the service."}
{"text":"We love Crust.  My wife and I come here at least once a month.  We love sitting at the bar.  Always great food and service."}
{"text":"this place was recommended by all my friends who have lived in Cleveland for a while. Apparently there's some team Edison's Vs. team Crust pizza feud going on locally. I haven't tried Edison's yet but Crust is delicious! It is a little pricier than I had expected but the pepperoni was worth it.   Word of advice, call ahead if you're ordering anything more than a single slice! I waited for a while !"}
{"text":"2/19/13  4.5 stars.  Received a text** from Crust alerting that all entrees were $10 each (dine-in only), so I stopped by after work.  Having combed the menu during one of my breaks, I knew I was going to try two new (to me!) pasta dishes, the Ravioli Pesto Cream and Grandma's Pasta, and a half (crustless) Tuscan salad.  I was welcomed immediately when I entered and was seated.  My server came by shortly with a glass of water and asked if I'd like to order anything else for dinner, so I asked to try a sample of the week's special red blend before I ordered a full glass.  I've rarely been disappointed with their selections, and sure enough, I liked what I tried and asked for a glass.  I placed my food order, tweaking the Ravioli dish a little by asking that the kitchen sub out the usual chopped fresh tomatoes for artichokes (I'd asked Mitch on the phone earlier if this would be OK, and he said \"no problem\") and asked if I could have some table bread, as well.  Ten minutes passed, and I still hadn't received any bread, nor the small crustless salad I'd ordered, but I was reading while I waited, so I wasn't too worried, although I did ask a passing server to see what was going on.  Around five to ten minutes later, my dishes arrived, and these came with a dinner roll each, so the missing bread was forgotten (although it's always nice to have some extra to enjoy at home).  The salad was still missing, so when my server came by for a check-up, I mentioned it, and he said he'll look into it.  A few minutes later, a full order of a Tuscan salad arrived.  (Because of the mix-up, the salad was on the house- thanks Crust!)  The Pesto Ravioli Cream with artichokes was terrific! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w#FxAhyaHn1yiexaqxjH5P3w  When I order creamy dishes, whether it's Italian, or Thai, I like the sauces silky and rich in flavor, and this dish certainly fulfilled my expectations.  The ravioli was cooked al dente (perfetto!), and the tangy artichokes served to cut the buttery richness of the sauce.  I LOVED every bite!  The sauce also went well with the dinner roll.  Squisito!  As for Grandma's Pasta http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=Ip7IWfw0zSUc3hHg8Ni5bQ#Ip7IWfw0zSUc3hHg8Ni5bQ, I can take it, or leave it.  One problem I had with it was that the ricotta was too cold, and I found the clash of hot and cold in this pasta dish a little strange.  I also found that the small chunks of sausage were much tastier than meatballs, and I found myself wishing the dish just contained sausage links, instead of the meatballs, which is a shame, since the meatballs are HUGE!  Last, but not least, the Tuscan salad was delicious!  Loved the peppery arugula, dressed in a housemade Italian vinaigrette, and the white beans, and when I read \"homemade croutons,\" I expected the usual cubed chunks of bread, not the toasted and seasoned slices of bread that adorned the bowl.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/crust-pizza-and-wine-cafe-scottsdale?select=h8xkl7KOxVxNx5r7m86lyg#h8xkl7KOxVxNx5r7m86lyg  I could order this salad as an entree and a glass of white and be happy!  With so many dining options to choose from in this valley of the Sun, it's great to know that whenever I do dine at Crust, dinner specials or not, I can always find a great meal and walk out happy and satiated!  **To receive Crust specials via SMS, text CRUST to 91944."}
{"text":"best chicken parm in the valley. Coming from NJ it took us a few years to find a place we could say that about but glad we found Crust."}
{"text":"After our third visit here, I HAD to change my review.    Decent food and service, but we had an issue with the check.  Which is perfectly fine, we dine out often, and have worked in the restaurant industry, so these things are no big deal.  However, the manager/owner decided to argue with us, and was incredibly rude.  After arguing for a few minutes, we were ready to simply walk out and never return.  He then said he would adjust the bill, took our credit card and ending up charging us an ADDITIONAL $20!!!  After he was supposed to (and agreed to) take the $20 OFF!  Trying to charge us an EXTRA $40.  I guess he didn't think we would catch it.  After he dropped off our credit slips, he disappeared.  The server explained that he knew what the owner did.  He apologized profusely, and explained that this happens all of the time.  The owner constantly overcharges people and tries to take advantage of customers.  The server fixed the issue, and of course we tipped him well for his service and even more for his honesty.    We wish the employees the best, but we will NEVER return due to the shady actions of the owner, and how terrible we were treated by him.    In 2013, I can't believe customers can still be treated so terribly by a place trying to earn repeat business.    I just don't want any other people to be taken advantage of here."}
{"text":"I moved to AZ from the east coast 14 years ago and have found many pizza places and none are a real new york \"Italian\" style pizza except for Crust. WOW. The Rustica is Fantastica. Fresh Cheese, fresh sauce and only the best of ingredients. Not only is the pizza fantastic but the service is wonderful, clean and friendly. As for the selection of wine...that too is great. The guys at crust know their wine and have something for everyone without breaking the bank. All my neighbors and friends love it and we will all keep going. Yours tastefully Elena Johnson"}
{"text":"Have loved the pizzas and sandwiches I've had here.  Want to try the other items, but so far the pizza and sandwiches call the loudest to me!"}
{"text":"LOVE Crust! Beautiful food...thank you Crust for doing what you do!  Your Neighbor in Tremont!!"}
{"text":"Let me preface this with the fact that I am a teenage boy who likes to eat... a LOT. When my boys and I went on a road trip and were craving pizza, we wanted to get authentic Cleveland food but also something cheap! When we happened upon Crust, first of all, the parking was super accessible. Secondly, the waitress was kind enough to inform us that everything down to the grain of wheat grown was homegrown and homemade. Third, each slice was MASSIVE. For 4.50 you could get an enormous 1 pound slice big enough to fully feed just about anyone. Cool modern atmosphere for a fraction of a fraction of the price. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was great and cheap! I'm used to spending $12+ on flat bread pizzas so was pleasantly surprised to see them for under $10. The wine was affordable and the service was great. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"For some reason the food tasted pretty bland as if they added extra water to their recipes. I ordered a flat bread and a salad one time and a sandwich the second(wanted to give it another shot) Just Ok, not what I expected."}
{"text":"The pizza is awesome and the staff was friendly. Got a hand tossed Hot Margherita Pepperoni and boy oh boy it the crust is awesome, tomatoes juicy and fresh, basil flavorful and when I reheated left overs in the oven on a cast iron skillet, I swear it was just good if not better than fresh! It could be mistaken for New York Styled, but in actuality it is Tremont Crust!"}
{"text":"They are new so it may take some time for the staff and overall logistics to smooth out. But I don't care, I want good food. This is a solid lunch spot. It even has outdoor seating!  My co workers got slices and since they thought they came out small, the staff gave them each two slices. The slices look a littler thicker than their Tremont store but still delicious. Plus the staff was attentive for us being outside offering marinara to dip the crusts and bringing us boxes. I got that mushroom gnocchi and it was beautifully rich. I can't wait to keep trying they menu."}
{"text":"I was craving pizza and decided to order take out from crust on the way home from work. I ordered the rustica version of the Little Nicky. The crust was crispy and had the perfect amount of ingredients (tomato:cheese:crust ratio) and toppings. It was bigger than I had expected, but I still managed to eat it all and enjoyed every bite."}
{"text":"The service was really bad for a Friday night. We took friends from out of town and our waiter rarely came over. We wanted to order more wine but the waiter didn't stop by. Also towards the end the waiter dropped off a dessert menu but never came back to ask if we wanted dessert and instead just brought the check. I wanted to order dessert! The place wasn't even crowded so not sure why our waiter was too busy to come around. Too bad because we would have spent a lot more money. The waiter seemed really inexperienced and like he didn't care. At one point another waitress came over to us and she was really nice and apologized that our waiter never took a second drink order."}
{"text":"The $3.00 huge plain slices are really good! For whatever reason, their pizza tastes drastically different when you order a PLAIN pie instead. I like the big slices, I'd much rather get that than a pie in the future. That said, their specialized pizza is excellent. The one with the goat cheese and mushrooms is fantastic, and I love that as well. Definitely like the desserts at this place. Top 5 pizzerias in Cleveland by my standards."}
{"text":"This is my first time ever writing a review but felt very appalled with the level of  service I received from the manager Tim/Timmy.  We have been to crust several times and always loved their food and service.  Unfortunately, today's experience was very different.  We ordered take out and my fiancee order their Grandmas pasta dish.  after eating a few bites and cutting into the sausage he realized that it was raw in the middle so we called to let them know.  The nice girl that took our order originally answered and passed us off to Tim.  After explaining to him the problem with our sausage he told me that that was basically impossible because they cook their sausage forever and made me feel like I would have to drive back there in a 107 degree heat wasting more of my gas and time to prove to Tim that their sausage wasn't fully cooked.  Tim then proceeded to put  his executive chef on the phone so I could once again explain the problem to him.  After now being on the phone for 10 mins and having to explain the issue with our food to three people my fiance patients ran out.  He then took over the call angrily and asked Tim if he was going to refund his dinner yes or no at least 5 times.  Tim still argued with him that there was no way the sausage could be under cooked.  My fiancee asked for his last name which he refused to give it to him.  He told him what they like to do is offer their guest a gift card to come back but my fiancee had had enough and just wanted to be refunded his money for his dinner and finally agreed to refund him for the dinner.  Me being in the restaurant business for 17 + YEARS have never seen a manager handle a situation so poorly.  When a guest of mine has a complaint about food I have NEVER seen my manager put  the chef  on the phone to explain to them about their food. Or even bring anyone one else into the situation.  Simply saying \"no problem I'm sorry that happened what can I do to fix it\" in the first few minutes of the call would have been just."}
{"text":"Really solid and creative pizza shop in Tremont. The banana pepper pizza is to die for and the ham and egg pizza is pretty darn good as well. They have a huge selection of specialty pies and subs(too many to choose from) and the service is always great. I highly recommend Crust."}
{"text":"I've never checked out Crust for dinner, but as a lunch spot they're killing it. It was relatively dead on a Thursday around noon and people are missing out. Got a high top table for me and 3 coworkers. The art is all pretty cool around the space with some sort of pizza theme. Shockingly, none of us got the pizza which is probably a crime because the slices looked huge and were on special for $3.   A local friend of ours had recommended the Spaniard as the best sandwich he's ever had in Cleveland. I spotted a cheesesteak on their menu so I convinced a buddy to split a cheesesteak and Spaniard so we could try half of each. Overall, I was let down by the Spaniard (but I guess it's hard to judge once it's been built up as the best). When I saw chorizo was on the sandwich, I expected ground chorizo and it came out as a sandwich with chorizo in the form of what I expect from deli sliced pepperoni. Don't get me wrong, it was good, just not the best option in my opinion.   BUT THE CHEESESTEAK. Phenomenal. I must warn though that you must be a garlic fan.  It was loaded with a garlicky taste that I loved. They also seem to be a huge fan of rosemary here too because I kept tasting it throughout the sandwiches and fries. All very good food and I'll be back for some slices."}
{"text":"A slice of pie the size of my head. Cheese on it was super tasty.  Carry strawberry Fanta. Yes.  Very nice guys working.  Will be back for sure!!"}
{"text":"They don't use gloves serving food (you would think in 2018 employers would have their employees with gloves on and washing hands) apparently NOT. Hand washing and gloves / proper sanitation is very important especially handling customers FOOD! Will not be back!"}
{"text":"My husband and I received a discount card in the mail from Crust and decided to try it out.  I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised on how everything was so delicious.  We started out with a large Greek salad that was nestled inside a bread bowl.  The bread is the same dough that is used in making the pizzas, but according to our waitress, is baked differently.  It is seasoned perfectly and was absolutely delicious.  I ordered the Grilled Mediterranean Chicken, which was probably one of the best chicken dishes I've had in a long time.  My husband ordered the sausage, black olive and mushroom pizza and that also was terrific.  After we finished the salad, I  could only eat one piece of chicken (there are 3 in this dish), so I had them wrap it up along with the leftover bread from the bread bowl.  My husband also couldn't finish his pizza and brought that home with us as well.  I'm so glad we found this nice, inviting eatery that has outstanding food, reasonably priced, wonderful service and a very friendly staff.  I couldn't have been more pleased and highly recommend this gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not the same as Tremont... not at all.  Food was doughy and under-cooked.  Staff members kept touching my food with their bare hands - even at the table.  Really freaked me out.  They gave me some better pieces to go, but again, kept touching the pizza for no good reason... rearranging pieces in the box."}
{"text":"Great pizza + no waits + cheap = highly recommend when you want to binge on cheese  We ordered the mushroom pizza which didn't have as many mushrooms as we would have liked.  But overall it was great!"}
{"text":"Updated: new location is open and the pie is good. Nice draft selections. No iced tea though. Bummer. Friendly staff  Appears to be closed. According to note on the door, they are changing locations to professor street."}
{"text":"Pepperoni pizza was amazing. Crust was a perfect blend of crunch and chew. The ultimate Italian was a tad spicy, but I loved it.  Roasted red bell peppers, banana peppers, seasoned olive oil and crushed red peppers made this sub disappear."}
{"text":"Stopped in about 1PM for lunch and the $5 pizza, drink & salad text special. The food was delicious as I've experienced at the Bell Road location but the service...was...so...slowwwwww and there were only about 6 tables occupied! The hostess finally came by after about 15 minutes and took my drink order. About 15 minutes later, Christine the waitress came and took my lunch order. After another 15 minutes I got my food, then had to wait another 15 minutes after finishing my meal to pay my check and get my change. The waitress was struggling a bit due to a wrist support she was wearing but over an hour for a slice of pizza and a salad seems excessive to me. Also, I did not find the restaurant to be as clean as the Bell Road location. I was sitting near a window and it was smeared and splashed with something. I'll go back because I love their food but I'll probably do carryout instead of eat in. Disappointed. I eat at the Bell Road location near my home several times a month and love it."}
{"text":"Crust has grown to be one of my new favorite spots. I come here with my boyfriend a lot and we love the cheese board & get it every time. The Caesar salads are one of the best I've had & their pizza is my favorite. I would say better then Gramaldi's. Their pizza sauce is amazing! Their alla vodka pasta is so dangerously good. Whenever I feel like Italian I come here. & it's very low key here so never too many people and its self seating which is nice."}
{"text":"First time here. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The ambiance was warm and inviting with dim lighting and upscale decor. We ordered  the garlic bread and meatballs as appetizers.  They came no more than 2 minutes before the pizza so no time to enjoy them - timing was way off. I liked my Uncle Louie's Rustica that had sausage, pepperoni, roasted tomatoes and fresh mozzarella and basil.  Yum!  My husband had a Rustica with sausage, pepperoni, bacon and shredded mozzarella and he didn't think it was very flavorful - he said mediocre.  Mine was very flavorful."}
{"text":"OH my damn. So freakin' good. HUGE slices of hot, cheesy, New York style pizza that is to die for. Very small seating area, so be prepared to wait if you're coming at lunch like we did, but if you're lucky you'll score a corner table. Can't wait to get this for take-out some night.   Delicious pizza pie!!"}
{"text":"We came in after the lunch rush for a late lunch and mostly had the place to ourselves.  The staff was friendly but not overly attentive.  I ordered their Tuscan Margarita and it was nothing to rave about.  It was supposed to have limoncello but tasted like they forgot to put it in as it was just a regular margarita.    Their calamari was very good.  It had the right consistency of batter and was perfectly fried, not overcooked.  Their marinara that came with it had a great spice level to it and it also came with plenty of lemon wedges as an option as well.  Their stromboli was delicious.  The bread was crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside and the filling had great flavor.  We also got an Uncle Louie pizza with added mushrooms and it was amazing.  The crust was nice and crisp (except a little soggy in the middle), perfect amount of sauce and the toppings were fresh.    Overall, a good experience."}
{"text":"I have found Crust to be very touch and go recently.  I used to think it was the best pizza in Cleveland and it is still good pizza.   Most recently, I went on a Friday evening and got take out.  The bottom of the crust was a bit burnt and it was super greasy.  While I expect and enjoy some grease on my pizza, it was way too much.  The sauce is well spiced and always delicious (though it does have a bit of a bite to it, so if you don't like spicy, their pizza is not for you).  The crust, when cooked right, is delicious - perfect amount of salt, nice and fluffy.  Overall, this place is great when it's done right, but mediocre when it's cooked imperfectly."}
{"text":"FABULOUS!! Just ordered to go (on Uber Eats) because my hubby was wanting pizza and this place does not disappoint! I was shocked to find somewhere so close to us with incredible food!! We ordered burrata, a mushroom and extra cheese pizza & cheesecake - unfortunately they didn't have cheesecake but called right away and subbed it for something else. We used to have a fav pizza place but now we found a new one!! Not only that but they apparently have a great HH! Can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. The best thing I've discovered in Scottsdale, hands down. I only wish I'd found them sooner so I didn't waste 3 days eating mediocre crap elsewhere when I could've been sampling their whole menu. The filet sliders are divine mouth pleasure. You owe it to yourself to try this masterpiece."}
{"text":"****3.5 STARS****  I came here Friday night for some dinner and to meet up with an old friend from long ago who was in from out of town.  I had never been here before, and thought it was worth a shot.  I wanted some place nice, but not to pretencious, so we came to crust.  The place is really nicely decorated, classy, simple yet elegant, and pleasing to the eye.  If I lived closer, I could see coming here for a glass of wine and a small appitizer during happy hour or early on a Saturday evening.  The place is on the small side, but they have a decent seating arrangement making the most of thier space.  The place seems to fill up quickly, so if you left waiting, your stuck hanging out on the sidewalk.    I really liked their wine and alcohol menu, and the staff seems to be educated and knowledgeable from what I could tell.  Menu had a great selection of food, and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  I ended up getting a glass of Reisling wine with a dish of Macaroni and Cheese.  I know, Mac and Cheese you say?  I wanted to keep it simple, and was really eyeing the filet mignon sliders, but decided at the last minute to go with the mac and cheese.    I will say the Mac and Cheese was good, but I wasn't blown away. I don't regret getting it, but I wasn't taken aback by it.  The presentation of it was nice, but I think it came out to crispy on the top.   Service was quick, friendly and professional.  Great for dates, fussy parents (like mine) or a nice night out with a girlfriend.  Menu selection was broad in dishes and prices, and decor was pleasant and relaxing.  I would reccomend stopping in and checking this place out."}
{"text":"I have been to Crust on two occasions now and both times have been great.  The pepperoni marhgerita pizza was to die for. You can really taste the high quality of the ingredients.  I also got a meatball sandwich that was comparable to my mothers which is as high as praise as one can give!  I had the Spanish chorizo sandwich on my second visit and I have never had any thing like it in a good way.  Judging by the name you would think that the sandwiches would be an afterthought but they are the best in Tremont!  Highly recommended and worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything we've tried has been outstanding. Pizza, linguine w clam sauce, chicken Marsala, calamari- all excellent!  Music level has been extremely high the past few visits making conversation difficult. Liked it better when a bit lower volume."}
{"text":"Server was helpful with choosing wine and honored a coupon for us, even though we were a few hours too early to use it (truly appreciated).  We always enjoy the meat and cheese platter, although our \"crusty bread bowl\" for our salad, was a little less warm and too crusty than it usually is. This is an overall good hang-out place where we can spend hours enjoying wine and food, especially the interestingly shaped \"Rustica\" pizzas."}
{"text":"The restaurant was super cold.  It took several times of complaining for any adjustment to be made to the temperature.  The food came out cold and everyone got their meal at different times.  Definitely a meal NOT enjoyed!"}
{"text":"I love Crust Pizza.  It is my favorite in Scottsdale!  When we eat in, they bring it out in halfs so that by the time we are ready, the second half is piping hot.  I love the taste of the pizza.  Love to go on Monday's when bottles of wine are 1/2 off. The pizza rustica is by far my favorite!!!!"}
{"text":"This is far and away the best pizza joint in Cleveland. I grew up in Philly and so I am partial to east coast style hand tossed. Crust nails it. They oil and salt their crust which makes it even better. If it weren't for Crust I don't know that I could live in Cleveland. The second best pizza here isn't even close. Please give this place all your business."}
{"text":"What have I been missing?  My mom and I came in here for the first time a few months ago. We had the Olive Plate on special and it was delicious. We both had Rusticas - I believe she had something with eggplant (yuck) and I had the God Daughter, which was delicious. Huge portions and delicious food.  I was excited to come back and bring my boyfriend since they have gluten-free pasta and doughs for the pizzas. I brought him and the server was incredibly helpful and answered all of my boyfriend's questions regarding the GF options. My boyfriend didn't get sick and thought the food was delicious.  We'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"They offer a really neat experience with their giant pizza slices. The pizza and the wings were both great. We received great service during lunch! There's also great views!"}
{"text":"Update: I posted a not so great review on yelp. I will say that the owner did contact me an offer to have me come back to make things right. I haven't been back but thought it was good business"}
{"text":"Awesome, we had the meat and cheese board it was very good and I particularly liked the pizza. The sauce had a really good flavor. My husband who is a pizza snob said it could have used more toppings, maybe more pepperoni I guess.  Service was great. Lots of fun."}
{"text":"Crust is kinda hidden and I didn't really know what to expect when going in... I was surprised to see so many reviews on file here. It's tucked away behind a grocery store. I've eaten at the sushi place next door before, but I think that was before Crust moved in.   Anyway, I was in here today to speak with one of the owners and left with a giant pizza. It looked too delicious to not take one home. You can see the giant open mouth oven with a giant flame toasting up the goodness as you walk in. They were making some interesting odd-shaped pies and their toppings looked high quality. Of course, they hand-toss.  The decor was really nice and I definitely want to come back to have a sit-down dinner. They have a Gelato bar in the corner as well and it took every ounce of strength for me not to order up some of that too... gotta watch my weight, right? The staff was all really nice and the part-owner was really cool.  When I got home with my pizza, it was still really hot and gooey... gotta love how well pizza travels in Arizona. Giant flavorful pepperonis and huge chunks of fresh juicy pineapple covered the pie and the sauce was very unique - they apparently bottle it up for sale.   It's a little on the spendy side, but you definitely get what you pay for. I'm a fan now and this only goes to further solidify my belief that Arizona is one of the best places in the country to find awesome pizza."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant. Pizza took one hour and was not cooked. Only gave us half of the pizza and charged full price. Thievery."}
{"text":"So amazing! Filet sliders are the best! So are the meatballs! So very good at a very decent price! Go, go, go! Move it to Crust! Yum!!!"}
{"text":"It takes a lot of confidence to name your pizza business after the foundation of what literally makes a pizza! From the ground up this pizza was built on its Crust and it has deserved its name!  Before ordering I asked the guys what I should try for my first visit. They highly recommended the Hot Margherita Pepperoni specialty pizza. So I went with it. Our friends ordered the same exact pizza so things got a little mixed up in the kitchen. For some reason only one was made but the gentleman who took my order quickly realized it and assessed the problem in a professional manor. He apologized and gave me a free slice of a pepperoni destroyer (Jumbo Slice) to enjoy as I waited and even refunded me for my specialty pizza. Excellent customer service! I'm not saying that because I was given freebies but more because they took notice of their mistake without me having to say anything. They made it a point to make sure I left happy without me dropping one complaint. These people truly take pride, in not only their product, but also in the way they conduct business in general.   It's hard for me to name my favorite pizza place because I have a favorite for many different categories. Well, tonight Crust has earned a spot on my list as my \"Favorite All Time Specialty Pizza.\" This Hot Margherita Pepperoni pizza was big in flavor and on top of a crust that was as crunchy and chewy as it gets. The hand sliced pepperoni, fresh garlic, roasted tomatoes & crushed red pepper complimented each other on the tastebuds with a perfect blend of flavors. It is finally dressed with a silky tasty layer of smoked mozzarella topped off with fresh basil to make for an aesthetically pleasing garnish. This specialty pizza was outstanding and I highly recommend it. I enjoyed it much more than the complimentary slice of the pepperoni destroyer.   From now on when it comes down to ordering a specialty pizza; it's Crust or Bust for me!"}
{"text":"Was not a fan. We got some large pizza with potatoes on it, and the potatoes were so hard to eat. If they had cooked the potatoes before throwing it on the pizza to bake, it probably would had been enjoyable. The ranch is also gross, wouldn't get it.  The service was bad too. It took so long to get their attention for asking for a side of ranch or to-go containers. Also, they made us go up there to grab the check, pay, and sign, when I saw them go to other tables to give them the check and do the usual bill paying routine. How rude"}
{"text":"Crust is seriously good.   a) The name don't lie. Their Crust tastes amazing. Although, I will admit one time I got it and it was a little TOO chewy, so that's something they should be aware of.  b) Very reasonably priced, tastes fresh, doesn't make you feel super guilty after eating 4 pieces.  However, I want to beg them to extend their hours. Closing at 7? Stay open til 10 or 11 and call it a day, Crust! Pleeeease. I want to eat you more. Nom nom nom."}
{"text":"Great pizza. We ate in and had a medium pizza and liked it so much that we went ahead and took two additional slices (they're huge) home with us."}
{"text":"So it's Saturday night. The girlfriend and I are watching our colleges play some top notch basketball while having a few adult beverages. After one school wins, mine U of A, we decide it's time for dinner. Well what  goes better with basketball and beers than pizza? We were proven very wrong......   So we ordered Crust because her sister had a great pizza a week earlier  and it was close. We decided the classic Hawaiian pizza would hit the spot for us tonight. We called in and they said it would take around 20 minutes which was perfect.  We arrived just in time and bought our $25 pizza as it was coming out of the oven. We got home and opened up the anticipated box too see our classical favorite....needless to saw we were shocked.  Crust's take on a Hawaiian pizza is the biggest miss I have ever seen in a classic pizza. Don't get me wrong I appreciate a new twist on an old classic but this was sheer laziness. First off it's a square not round pizza this in my mind was a plus due to the thickness and crispiness. However that was the only plus to the whole pizza.   For those of you that went to public elementary school do you remember pizza day? Its was a square greasy piece of pizza with cubed pepperoni. Well the Hawaiian pizza at Crust isn't far off.  The pizza came out with 8 large slices and a medium thick crust. The cheese and meat looked like deli slices you would pick up at safeway laid on top not even covering the pizza. The final touch was canned cubed pineapple on top of the deli meat and cheese.  If you are looking for a $25 pizza your toddler can make but want to call it a Scottsdale fusion then I suggest you run to Crust. If not then I  would suggest Papa Johns....they deliver...."}
{"text":"Though most flock to Crust for the pizza and pasta, sometimes a salad is in order. Gotta eat healthy(ish) every few meals, right?  Good news - Crust serves salads as well. Meal-sized portions that could satisfy even zealous appetites like mine. This summer, Crust is serving a kale and apple salad that comes highly recommended. Yes, you heard it here first, I'm actually suggesting that you order a dish with kale as the main attraction.  Served with shredded chicken and a dollop of goat cheese on top, this green concoction had just the right leafy:meat ratio. And the bowl was very generous, kept this girl satisfied until dinnertime.   My dining companion enjoyed the Greek salad, which comes in its own crusted bread bowl. You can literally eat your way in and out of this salad.   Very nice, attentive service and a pretty quick lunch, which is important on a weekday."}
{"text":"To start off- the crust is too dry for a place named Crust... My boyfriend was happier with his pizza than me but overall both were good. The individual slices are huge and pretty affordable. Service is great though and it's a fun place."}
{"text":"Not happy with the service today.  They screwed up my order a bit, left out the marina for my calzone which i didn't notice till i got home. I ordered extra too and didn't get any.  I understand people make mistakes, but the guy was a little rude when i called and told them about it. He put a credit on my account, but only after i asked him to since i wasn't going to drive back out there.  Food is great, and usually the service is too, but not today. guy working the phones, and also the guy working the register need to stop acting like they hate their job and be a lot more friendly to customers. And when you screw up someones order, try to make it right, then you wont get negative reviews."}
{"text":"I was excited to see that Crust had opened a second location closer to downtown and much closer to my work!  Their original location is in Tremont. The pizza restaurant serves enormous pizzas as well as pizzas by the slice. It's a quick and delicious lunch. You can order a whole pizza or customize a slice or two. They have many different topics from specialty cheeses to meats and fresh veggies. One of the best things about the pizza is the crust. It's soft and flavorful. Crust also offers different salads and pasta. If you're looking for a flavorful, quick and inexpensive lunch Crust is your place!"}
{"text":"Excellent wine selection. The pizza is HUGE and the ingredients are so fresh. We got the pesto and bacon pizza and added shrimp. The crust was perfect, as was the pesto. I would recommend it for small group outings. The portions are large, but the atmosphere is casual-classy rather than tacky and loud."}
{"text":"This was certainly a Mother's Day Mess. There were 7 of us that got a table for dinner last night (Mother's Day). It was crowded (completely expected, as, well, all restaurants are crowded for Mother's Day), but not only was every table filled (either with people or with dirty plates that weren't cleared), they seemed to be extremely understaffed. Literally, the only thing that went right was that we were seated on time.  The waitress brought out 4 waters (again, there were 7 of us), and it took nearly 10 minutes to get the other 3 waters (she brought 4 over), and then we were NOT offered water again for the rest of the night. I kid you not, the only reason why I had 2 cups of water the entire dinner was because she brought an extra water to start. No one at our table was offered of given refills of their 7-Up, their water, their iced tea, and I was never asked if I would like a second beer.  About 20 minutes after being seated, she took our order. After placing the orders, because our table was directly next to the door (I was the unfortunate soul at the end of the table and literally right next to the door), I noticed people congregating directly next to me, and next to the \"Please Wait to be Seated\" sign. It took the staff roughly 10-15 minutes to even NOTICE these people that were hovering over my while i was sitting at the table. Not to seat them, but just to even recognize that people were there waiting to try and be seated. I keep watching the 3 staff workers (1 male who appeared to the be the bartender and 2 females who were waitresses) who would look up and see the groups of people, but not do anything. Seriously, they'd do absolutely nothing and the groups started to just seat themselves. That's when the staff workers would go over to them and ask if they had a reservation.  This was my first and will be my only time in, which is unfortunate, because the food was good. I had the pepperoni and ham rollatini and shared a pepperoni pizza with a few others at the table. This is also where we had to wait to get our 7th plate and place setting for grandma, as they didn't even have enough table settings for our group. We went up to the bartender to ask for silverware and a plate, and he said he didn't see any. That was seriously his response; \"he didn't see any.\" So yes, grandma actually used a napkin as her plate for the meal. The waitress did finally bring over a plate when we finally tracked her down, but by then she was already full and done eating.  When we had finished the meal, we waited another 20 minutes for our waitress to either give us the bill, or check on us; none of the above ever happened. I went out with credit card in hand walking after the waitress to get the bill paid. When she finally returned with the check, everything was signed, and then I realized she never gave the credit card back. So we had to wait again and find her and get the credit card back.  Yes, I would imagine (at least I would hope) that this is not typical, but this was just absolutely horrendous service. I do understand that service becomes slower as it gets more crowded, but the second you substitute poor service just for getting people in and out, you're asking for a poor review like this. Attention to detail is critical in the restaurant business (especially in the city of Scottsdale where there is truly wonderful restaurant choices on every block), and when you don't once refill waters or drinks for an entire table, when you have a customer eating off of a napkin for their meal, when you cause a blockade at the front door directly next to customers eating because there's no one greeting/informing guests of the status of open tables or a wait time, when you don't give a credit card back with the check, you deserve to get a 1-star rating."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Atmosphere and people.  Do not miss this place.  Love it. We came in at 935 knowing they close at 10 but had been traveling and needed food. They treated us like the first customer of the day.  Wonderful."}
{"text":"After spending the day in downtown Cleveland with my husband and little one, I suggested Crust as I had been wanting to try it. I was happy to learn they had high chairs and pizza by the slice that was ready to go. Quite a score. We ordered 2 large slices and it was a bit pricey, we would have been better off just ordering an entire pizza, but again the convenience was the focus here. The slices were huge though. They were cut into smaller pieces for us and we really enjoyed them."}
{"text":"Crust is pretty good pizza. It is a little pricey in my opinion, but super tasty and local, so you don't mind paying a bit more. We ordered two slices and that was about $15, which is nuts. The slices are huge, but start at $6 a slice."}
{"text":"This place is SOOOO GOOD!!! My 7 yo son & I grabbed a pizza to go tonight. The staff was super friendly. We watched the guy toss the dough & make the pizza, and the same guy who made it personally came out and handed my son the pizza. AND THIS PIZZA WAS AMAZING. It's our new fav pizza place. My kid never eats the crust of anything.. he eats this crust. He also said he would die for this pizza lol!!"}
{"text":"Really good pizza, really nice desserts (Italian donuts and canolli). Family friendly, to the max. The owner and staff are very classy. While the meal was satisfying and tasty, we did have the misfortune of running into one of Scottsdale's bottom feeders also patronizing the establishment (at the bar, of course). Following an ugly verbal exchange, the owner intervened and made us feel happy again we'd chosen this restaurant. Makes me proud to share his Sicilian heritage. Also terrific was our server, Angel. Besides efficient, he was very kindly to my daughters, who were shaken by the ugly exchange. Class..... We will return to this wonderful place on our next visit to this beautiful city."}
{"text":"When my friend first told me to meet him here I was a little skeptical. Really, all I knew is that were going to some sort of strip mall/plaza on Hayden and Indian Bend. After driving around, I spotted the place behind the grocery store.  Not only is this place cute with high and low tables, we made it just in time for happy hour! Can't complain with half-off all items from the bar and apps.   The Pro's: --Happy Hour is awesome --The Mozzarella Encorozza is delicious (though it is basically mozzarella sticks --The rustica pizzas are delicious - went with the garlic + eggplant, and bella rosa, both good --They have gelato and mini cones that are just $1  The Con's: --The pizzas are odd shaped. It just makes it a little more difficult to carry out a pizza. --The location is not ideal and a little difficult to find.  Overall, I'd definitely go back and try out some of their other pizza options."}
{"text":"Picked up a pizza after work the other day. It was alright. Nothing special but not bad. We just got pepperoni since the girlfriend is fairly unadventurous when it comes to toppings so maybe if i got  a specialty pie I'd like it more. I'll give it another shot, and dine in next time as well."}
{"text":"The Rustica at Crust Pizza and Wine Cafe is nothing short of awesome. I'll drive up the 101 from Chandler for this. Sorry Catherine M. your taste buds need some work. Extra doughy? Never - the crust is perfect, the sauce is perfect and the service..... None better."}
{"text":"Items Selected: 1-Lb Slice with Housemade Meatball Mushroom Ricotta Gnocchi - Mixed Mushrooms, Fresh Rosemary, Garlic, White Truffle Oil, Parmesan Cream Sauce  Another locally-owned favorite in trendy Tremont, Crust has made a name for itself amongst Clevelanders looking for Pizza a very *Big* way, the small shop on Kenilworth Avenue filling up both patrons and it's counter with oversized slices - an average of one pound each even before toppings are added.  Admittedly divey from the outside, an interior of hightops plus a wall-based menu and cold-cases not particularly eye catching either, Crust nonetheless adheres to the strict standards of a scratch kitchen by hand making all Breads and Pastas in-house while sourcing local, regional ingredients as possible, nothing encountered in house straight from a box or a bag with Dough given time to ferment as the team visibly chops other fresh Ingredients.  More than fairly priced for the portion size and product quality, solos slightly limited simply as a result of limited stomach capacity, it was after chuckling at three enormous pies  that an order was placed with a young lady at the counter, one pre-made slice topped with slices of an enormous meatball before being placed in a warming oven.  A total of perhaps six minutes passed between order and delivery, the substantial slice now hot and melty with just a touch of char imbued in the crunchy crust, suffice it to say that Crust is not simply a 'shock and awe' spot hoping to hit a homerun with large portions, the flavor was actually better than much of what can be found across America as the zesty sauce is unsweetened and lightly acidic beneath creamy Mozzarella - that same word entirely appropriate when describing a bubbling hot bowl of Potato Dumplings and tender Mushrooms taking a bath in Parmesan that tastes faintly of Truffle Oil and much more robustly of Rosemary and roasted Garlic."}
{"text":"The best atmosphere for great Italian food.  Having Penn's vodka and Greek salad.  Mmm"}
{"text":"This place used to be AWESOME. The bruschetta was delicious my wife and I would go there and have a full dinner and we started with the awesome bruschetta. But for some reason, maybe the ingredients were more costly, they discontinued the wonderful tasty melt in your mouth bruschetta. Not all at once mind you they changed it about a year and a half ago. And when we told them we were disappointed, we were met with a shrug. So sad.  But hey, why should customers get what they like? Who needs them.  A real disappointment."}
{"text":"Owners were working, and were awesome and so friendly. Had the butternut squash ricotta gnocchi and the club sub sandwich. Both were delicious. Had a slice of pizza which I was not nearly as crazy about, even though the size of the slice was huge, making it fine. Quality of the cold cuts in my sub were really good, and there was a feeling of warmth in the food."}
{"text":"Crust is amazing, I ordered the \"Uncle Loui\" pizza and my wife had the Greek salad with chicken.  The portions were perfect and the flavors were fresh! I am a pizza fanatic and they know what they are doing here.  The atmosphere was very nice, romantic yet friendly setting.  We went on a night when there wasn't much business and we weren't over catered to which I thought was nice. Overall a great dining experience for my first Yelp review.  This was our first honeymoon dinner and I wish we had one back home!"}
{"text":"Small place, I would recommend taking the pizza to go. Many different options. Pizza was good. Especially like the pizza with the egg on it. Will return to try more combinations."}
{"text":"Nom nom nom.  Good hand tossed pizza. I've had take out from Crust before- however, getting it fresh is the way to go.  We stopped in tonight- it's definitely a small restaurant with maybe 5 high top tables, but it's fun to go in and watch them make pizza.  We split the roasted eggplant pizza- it came out nice and hot- with a slight crunch to it's crust. The arugula was fresh, the balsamic was tasty, the red sauce was great, and the crust- was sooo good. They added some salt to the crust- I could eat just crusts all day long. We devoured a whole pizza by ourselves- it was that good. The staff looked impressed by us too.  If you're craving for a good pizza crust, crust is the place to be! Definitely worth the try!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying I ordered a single slice of pepperoni pizza.  It was the oddest tasting, colossally sliced piece of pizza that I've ever experienced.   The size of the slice is just obnoxious and an extra topping is $1 extra on top of the original price of $4.50.   Obnoxiously large and utterly unfulfilling because of how thinly the crust is rolled out. I didn't even bother eating the \"head\" of the pizza because of how awkward the crust actually tasted.  Believe me...I came in there thinking I was going to be blown away by this homemade crust that ACTUALLY looked extremely delicious. All I can say is that it had a weird taste to it. I can't even EXPLAIN it, but something was just off and it didn't taste right.   For a $1 extra per toppings they surely scrimped on the pepperoni slices. Probably about 5 pepperonis on an EXTRA EXTRA large pizza...HMMMMM.   Their desserts look amazing so I'm definitely going to go back for that and to retry the pizza, but honestly I just don't understand the hype.   The pizza sauce was bland, the crust had an odd taste, and the nice enough tasting pepperonis were few and far in between."}
{"text":"this place definitely worths a ten star!!  I ordered the capocollo  large thin crust and it was MAD AMAZING like you have no idea how good it was! I was carrying this pizza in 10f weather and I could see the steam coming out of the pizza box. I smell it and I almost decided just to eat in the snow but I had some self control so I took it back and shared it with my bf. my bf a super picky, critical eater even decided to give it a 4.5, which is prob the highest he's given any restaurant in a while.  the people working there were super friendly too. it only took me 10 min to get my lovely pizza. what a speedy service!!"}
{"text":"While I'm not a huge fan of Crust, I can dig it. My office is right nearby so we find ourself there for drinks every once in a while.   They have a good happy hour with ice cold Peroni. Can't find fault with that. Love the icy cold glasses as well.  As far as the food, I'm mixed. I'm not a fan at all of their medium crust square pizza. Does nothing for me. Not a fan of the texture. That was my first experience with Crust and it took me a long while to go back.  My next experience was ordering their thin crust 20\" pies to go. They were actually quite good. We've now done that a number of times and they have been consistently good. I'm a fan of those. I have also had their hand stretched rusticas a few times and they are nice too.   As far as non-pizza food, the only thing I've is their meatball sliders. They were fine but nothing special.  So I guess I'd say that to me, Crust is somewhat inconsistent. I'm a big fan of their happy hour, their cold beer and their 20\" thin crust. Outside of that, it's been hit & miss."}
{"text":"I stopped by Crust today in an effort to try some \"good\" pizza.  I moved here from NY region just a few months ago, and cannot find good pizza.  So let's begin with the hype, the place was definitely busy and yes, you get huge slices.  The flavor profile was lacking, the crust was salty but there was no flavor in the sauce and the pepperoni was somewhat tasteless.  I also had the the blue cheese and bacon salad.  The blue cheese was too much, very overpowering.  It was okay and perhaps I may try a hot sub, but nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"This place is great! From the outside it's pretty nondescript, but once inside it's a charming Italian eatery and wine bar that solicits the feel of old Italy without the expensive cost of airfare and lodging. They have also recently undergone renovations that have increased their size by almost double! The food is delicious (the antipasto is excellent, as is the Tuscan white bean salad), and their wine list is quite extensive! They also offer delicious specialty cocktails if wine is not your forte. Their happy hour menu includes a large selection of their every day menu items, and drinks are heavily discounted. Also, depending on the night, wine bottles are half off! I would absolutely recommend this place to friends and family looking for a good place to relax and enjoy some Italian fare!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place! I had never been here and it was pretty dead at lunch so I didn't know what to expect but I thoroughly enjoyed the meal.   Lunch portion of Chicken Marsala was really, really good. Still a good size and good amount of chicken and pasta. Their lunch menu also has pizza of course and several dishes to chose from should you not want pizza or salad. The price is right as well for a lunch menu.   The ambience is nicer than I expected and I liked the space. Our waitress was very nice and on point. I would definitely come back for lunch on a day I am craving pasta and would love to check out their pizza as well."}
{"text":"I've been to the crust in Tremont and decided to try this new location since I work downtown.  The pizza is great and affordable! I love getting a slice and adding the stuffed banana peppers.    Pluses... The location is much bigger and definitely has more table Space so you can come with a group & the pizza is still great   Down side.. I miss the big wooden pizza plates from the Tremont location, and the crust seems a little more \"well done\"... Maybe they're breaking in the new oven??   Overall, good on the go food and prices. You pay $4.50 for the slice then you pay $1 or $2 for extra toppings-can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I'm involved with a large non-profit organization.  We had one of our team meetings here.  The food was excellent, and good happy hour specials as well.  I had a salad, which came in this amazing bread bowl.  The manager was so awesome and brought us out some desserts to try which were to die for!  I'm looking forward to returning here in the near future."}
{"text":"Crust is a classy little Italian bistro with a neighborhood atmosphere but a continental reach. Almost everything is made in-house, or sourced from other local small businesses who share the same passion for quality. It bills itself as a Pizza and Wine Bar, but it is so much more. The night we were there the special was lasagna, which was truly special. The homemade noodles were light, the sausage tender, and the tomato sauce subtle and sophisticated. And NOT SALTY! Thank you guys. The portion was large enough to share with my wife, and but I didn't want to let any of it get away!   With a name like Crust, its pizza has to be good . . . and it is. It is one of the few places I have found that does whole wheat crust well, thin yet chewy. Their \"rusticas\" are unique, small specialty pizzas in a T shape that is easier to eat than the traditional round. We ordered the Garlic and Eggplant with fresh mozzarella and basil. Once again, all I can say is WOW! You gotta try it, and if you are lucky enough to arrive on a day when they have fresh minestrone, you must try it too!  I have read a few of the negative reviews here and I just don't understand what is wrong with some people. We spent quite awhile talking with Mitch, the owner, and David, the Executive Chef. These are passionate people who manage the restaurant with love for the food (and the customers). I think you have to be suspicious of reviews where the only negative comments are about the service . . . .  Guess you just can't please all the people all of the time, but I was pretty pleased one time. You owe it to yourself to give Crust a try."}
{"text":"Fantastic happy hour, excellent wine, unique salads and delish pizzas!! Great service too!!"}
{"text":"My visit was perfect.... customer service was great. My pizza was delicious... I have been back several times and I love it."}
{"text":"Being new to the neighborhood, my fiancé and I have been making our way through the seemingly endless catalog that is Tremont Dining. We decided that pizza was the best option for the night. When it comes to pizza in Tremont, there seems to be a reigning king amongst locals and Clevelanders alike, but we won't get into that. My barber has been telling me about Crust for quite some time now, and thus it was time to give them a shot!   I called ahead and ordered the Hot Margherita Pepperoni pizza-hand tossed. Our pizza was ready in 20 min, just in time for the Cavs Game! The staff was very friendly and even made recommendations for my next visit. (They knew i'd be back) GOOD GOD that pizza was delicious. Each bite was better than the bite before. The ingredients were insanely fresh, almost to the point that the pepperoni wasn't even necessary. Huge chunks of tomato, fresh basil, garlic, and the cheese was perfect.  We could not have be happier with our decision.  Crust, we will be enjoying you again very shortly!"}
{"text":"Very good slice of pizza! Might be a bit too much dough( hand tossed) but I loved it. Flavorful sauce, authentic pepperoni and cheese. Fast, polite service. I only wish I had gotten a little more creative with my toppings. This was not a cheap slice of pizza, but you get what you pay for. Quality!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about a year and I am in love with their food! I moved from the east coast a few years ago, and couldn't find chicken Francese (one of my absolute favorite dishes) anywhere! I was craving it and explaining it to some of my coworkers, and no one seemed to know what chicken francese is! To my delight, one of my coworkers happened to go to Crust and see it on the menu, and I practically ran here a couple of days later!   The chicken francese is perfectly made, with light delicious lemon butter sauce! I get it everytime I come, even if I get another meal, I always at least get chicken francese to go, so I can enjoy it the next day!  The chicken parm is also absolutely amazing, another one of my favorites!  (The penne vodka, pizza, garlic knots and meatball sliders, and utter cake are also delicious!!!)   Crust has a great happy hour, $5 sangrias and appetizers specials.  If you go on their website, you can also sign up for text messages and get weekly deals, such as free garlic knots!"}
{"text":"I first went to crust over 5 years ago and the food has always been fairly good. After the disaster that was the street eats festival today, I was happy to go eat lunch at Crust instead. I went with the BF and another couple (Erin B and her BF). We all shared the meat and cheese plate, which was good, but nothing extraordinary. We each got a rustica pizza and they were all really good, I got the classic, the BF got the New York, Erin got the one with pesto and bacon, and her BF got the meat. These pizzas are a funny shape, but still tasty. We didn't have the best service today....our water was empty through most of the meal, but generally the service is good. I do wish they would bring back the 'pot brownie'....a brownie in a metal pot with banana, nuts, ice cream, whipped cream....completely delicious and amazing....how can that not be on the menu???? Overall, a pretty solid pizza place."}
{"text":"Really tasty pizza. House made dough and everything is from scratch. They are moving to a new location this spring with expanded dining space, parking lot, and.... a bathroom!!! Those are pretty popular with customers these days.  The staff are friendly, and the prices are reasonable. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Crust is always good, but tonight we had the Tortellini ala Panna (basically carbonara). It was unbelievable. Loaded with prosciutto and so creamy. A must have. Dave was a great server, and Chad the manager was warm and hospitable."}
{"text":"We ate here for a friend's lunch and weren't impressed.  Food was just ok and we were unhappy with the service.  One of us specifically ordered a pesto chicken pasta off of the dinner menu and were surprised when they brought a dish that contained zero pesto.  We questioned it and they said \"it's in there but it was the last of it.\"  No.  No pesto.  It was also overcooked and tasteless.  The server made no attempt to check in after we questioned it, nor did she notice when the dish was barely touched.  We had to ask her to take it off the bill.  No apology either.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza. Really good meatball appetizer. Impressive service. Quick refills. Friendly employees.  Couldn't hear each other talking across the table it was so loud. We actually left to have coffee elsewhere so we didn't have to shout.  If this is just me that's had this experience I will definitely try again - I just can't stand dining in a place where you have to yell at the person across from you. This was on a Wednesday evening around 6:00 - maybe I'll try again on a Mon or Tues or go a bit later when there aren't so many big families or kids - idk. Weird no one else mentions it."}
{"text":"I'm sorry - maybe it's because I'm the City (NY) but I just don't get pizza down here. They have amazing food in Scottsdale but not loving the pizza. I got the The Blonde Bombshell Sicilian Crust and East Coast Grandma's.  Bombshell was way too dry. There should have been more oil and cheese. The dough was way too thick, too. It was like bread. The Grandma's marinara was decent but was lacking some oregano and not nearly enough parm, mozz or garlic. It was all sauce. Dough could have been a little crispier. There is potential here!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Place is modern and clean, good vibe. Ordered a few drinks and 2 pizzas - the mushroom and the four cheese. Both fresh and excellent.  I would recommend this for great pizza!!"}
{"text":"We had spaghetti and meatballs, and their Scottsdale Pasta.  Both were delicious as is their bread.  Their garlic bread did have an odd taste.  I think it's because they use fresh garlic which is great, but I think it needs to be slightly toasted to make the flavor of the garlic better.  They mince their garlic, and maybe crushing it into their butter, spreading then grilling would taste much better."}
{"text":"The Spainard sandwich is top notch, highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Highly recommended! My boyfriend and I stopped by out of the blue for dinner without knowing anything about the place and we were surely amazed loved the food, service, wine and everything about this place!! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Now I haven't been to Crust since the first 6 months of them opening, back in '09 I believe it was, but I used to stop by atleast once a week on the way home because their pizza was my favorite.  Cool atmosphere, and the chefs/employees are nice. I remember the chef would always look at me with a crooked eye when I ordered a Ham/Pineapple/Garlic Stromboni (I think it was called), but I haven't found a place yet in San Diego that has better pizza. Hope things are well!"}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza from here since it opened. I have never had a bad meal. It's always fresh and delicious. There is very limited seating so I usually take it to go."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza in Cleveland. Really awesome spot to hang out and have a beer to! The gnocchi is incredible to. Can't beat Crust!"}
{"text":"Update: the owner responded professionally and, from all outward appearance, has reinforced training and updated documentation to clarify happy hours. Subsequent visits reflect professionalism and, as always, great food."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. The food was good and made to order. It is a nice place with a friendly staff. They give you a nice size portion for what you pay and have a nice variety of pasta, pizzas and entrees to choose from. I will be going back."}
{"text":"Outstanding every time!  Oven and staff are exceptional with great service!"}
{"text":"Shortly after writing my review I received a message from Katie the General Manager to be kind enough to accept a $25 gift to return and give us another chance to earn your business. I thankfully replied that I would decline the offer. I then received another message from Katie who had the audacity to request I change my review.   Here is what she wrote: \"Thank you for taking the time to reply. I understand your answer but I do wish there was something I could do to change your mind. Yelp reviews significantly effect our business and I would be extremely gracious if you would consider updating your review.\" Enough said..."}
{"text":"the rustica looks like a penis.  thankfully, it tastes like pizza. super thin, crunchy crust pizza.   the husband and i went for lunch to the one in scottsdale, the other day. we shared a spinach salad and each had some pizza. the salad was very good and plenty for two people to share.   i had the appropriately called \"meat\" rustica and it was really good. this is the only the second place in phx i've had pizza that doesn't make me feel like i splashed my face in grease after. (grazi is the other).   the husband had two slices, which were more than plenty for a meal. they were completely different styles of pie and both were great.   we'll definitely hit this one again."}
{"text":"Yaaay for crust! Delicious rustica, great spinach & strawberry salad, & always top notch service. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love Crust.  Their new hip and modern urban restaurant has plenty of room for a group. Most recent visit was for the Yelp Supper Club.  Judging from everyone's empty plates and smiles, it was a hit.   I have tried many dishes:  rosemary fries - crispy and great herb taste Hand rolled Gnocchi with mushroom cream - so rich, so creamy, soft little pasta pillows - yum Beets and Strawberry salad - one of my all time  favorite salads  Pizza - yes, baby it is large, crispy and great  Can't go wrong here.  I have also ordered delivery for office lunches a few times and have not been disappointed.  The sheet pizza aka The Destroyer is almost 3 foot in diameter and weighs 10 pounds!  I kid you not, it is massive.  Our deliveries have been right on time with out any issues."}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick but tasty dinner last night on the way to the movies. We decided to try Crust based on the good Yelp reviews.  Wow, were we happy we did!  Found 2 seats at the bar and since we only had a short time went with the Tuscan Salad and a Spinach Rollatini.  We are vegetarians and were happy to see that we had several choices to pick from instead of just one or two things we find in many spots.  The salad was super fresh and light. Dressing was not overpowering and the arugula was the best!  The rollatini had tons of spinach in it and just the right amount of cheese. They serve it with a side of red sauce which is also very fresh and light tasting.    It is hard to find good Italian that is not overly salty and/or fatty but Crust does it just right.  The bartender was very generous and gave us samples of two appetizers on the house!  The bruschetta was to die for!! The wine list is extensive also.  Don't worry about finding it, we had no problems...just remember it is on the north east side of the shopping center and faces Indian Bend.  Good atmosphere either for a couple or a family. Can't wait to go back and try the pizza."}
{"text":"I went to Crust last night and was very disappointed. I ordered the medium crust pizza with spinach as a topping. The pizza arrived lukewarm, and the spinach had a bitter taste. The service was friendly and the ambiance was OK, but I think that Joe's Pizza in downtown Scottsdale has a much better Sicilian stye of pizza for a much lower price. I will not be returning to Crust."}
{"text":"Crust is the type of restaurant that is worth checking out, but not quite worth coming back for again.  Everything about it is alright:  the ambiance is alright, the food is alright and the service is alright, but nothing really makes this pizza place stand out from the zillion other pizza places in Scottsdale.  According to their menu, they are known for their \"hand stretched\" Rustica pizza (the one that is shaped like thong underwear), however even that was mediocre.  We decided to try their famous thong pizza, along with a few other slices of pepperoni and sausage pizza and a fried mozzarella appetizer.  The fried mozzarella was decent, but nothing memorable or especially good compared to other places.  The slices of pizza were pretty good sized and tasty, which was fortunate since we had to wait about 45 minutes after we finished our slices to get our Rustica!  They must have been doing a lot of hand stretching back there, because it sure did take a long time for it to arrive.  It was good, but nothing we would want to wait nearly an hour for again.  To sum up, if you're in the mood for a decent enough pizza, then go to Crust, but just don't expect to have really memorable or exceptional dining experience because you will be disappointed when that doesn't happen."}
{"text":"The food is really nothing special.  We've been to many pizza and wine restaurants and this is one I wouldn't go back to for a few reasons. Mainly because the food was just average at best. The artichoke dip was not great, the bread was hard as a rock and the chips were stale. The pizza was just kind of blah. The service also was not so great, the waiter forgot our salad and completely spaced out ordering one of our pizzas, which actually, we were glad to see because we didn't really want it after trying the first one.  There are better places to go for sure."}
{"text":"My review can be summed as: I didn't love it. To put in another way: this joint is perfectly mediocre. Mediocre service, mediocre menu, mediocre food. I won't and don't go back (even when there's a wait next door at Sakana Sushi). I had the Rustica--basically a giant, extra doughy, over-priced slice of pie. Did not love. My friend had an unmemorable pasta dish."}
{"text":"I was REALLY excited about Crust. I thought that Edison's might have a run for it's money when I witnessed the signage for Crust before they opened. I surfed the web trying to find an opening date.   I was REALLY disappointed in the hours. I mean... I understand having scaled back hours when you're a new business. But, why wouldn't those hours be in the evening vs. the afternoon? I realize people eat pizza for lunch... but this seems like a \"dinner pizza place\".   I can appreciate several types of pizza - greasy college pizza, creative pizza, homemade pizza.... hell, even chain pizza. I suppose I expected this to be fresh, artisan, fancy pizza. :)   When I went in to get the pizza, I was even more excited. The staff was SOOO friendly. I thought about giving an extra star just because they were SO nice. The shop was really clean and cool. They were even slicing pepperoni and shredding fresh cheese - no freezer packaged toppings here!! So, I am thinking... \"nice staff, fresh ingredients... this is going to be AWESOME!\"  Hmm. I get home, I open my box... I'm less than impressed. The CRUST (for which this place is named, right?) tasted like raw flour... and nothing else. It was floppy and flavorless. Big bummer. The pepperoni was delish (and flavorful). The sauce was bland.   It was new - like within the first few weeks of opening. Maybe I will give them a bit of time and check it back out. I always want to support new Tremont businesses. I want to love this place. I'll update if/when I give it another chance."}
{"text":"Doors wide open.  Pizza sitting out on the counter looking old.   Grabbed by a clerk with 2 bare hands, toppings just dropped on.  It was delivered in under 5 minutes.   How could it possibly be warm?"}
{"text":"ahhhhh I don't really know. I have never been to crust tremont, I know it is beloved on yelp. I stopped in at this location at about 11:30am this week.... I got a slice of pepperoni.... I would recommend stopping in and giving it a try, so I did give it 4 stars. Cause the pizza is insane! The slice was bigger than my face. So that was funny. It came in its own normal sized pizza box. They had these huge pizzas ready. So it was amusing and unique in that way.  I went up to the counter and ordered my pizza slice... They had their two specialty pizzas of the day ready. Also I think they have like cheese pizza ready and you can add some toppings and they are like re-baked on maybe??... but I'm not really a fangirl of toppings being re-baked on as an after thought. It makes the pepperoni look like it... doesn't belong there. IDK. Like the \"pepperoni\" is an alien posing as pepperoni and waiting on the cheese. Like 'nuthin' wrong here!' - 'then why do you look like you don't belong??' But it does facilitate a quick slice which is a benefit. (Not saying anything was abnormal. Good quality and clean pizza and ingredients- just a prejudice of mine.)  Slice didn't take too long to bake. At first bite, pizza was average. A little later I went back to try again, and noticed the flavor profiles of the delicious sauce and the nuances of flavor in the well-textured crust. So then I was enjoying it much more. So I am sorta conflicted. Would like to go back and get a regular pizza baked fresh and see what happens.  Place is clean. Employees were polite. Quite a bit of parking. Good value. Slice was $5.50 but huge and filling. Crust - give it a try!"}
{"text":"Greek salad with a slice of cheese pizza. Everything made from scratch. Crust is one of the best I have had, with a dash of sea salt adds a nice touch. Salad had hard boiled egg, kalamata olives, tomato, feta cheese.  Greek dressing is excellent, I need to find out what's in this. I used the leftover dressing three times that same week. Its hard to get pizza to stand out, but this place stands tall. This place should do well in Tremont.  Now two of my favorite pizza shops are in Tremont."}
{"text":"Simply Delicious! Love this place! This was my first time and deff not my last. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful. I got the skornicopia (spelling?) as a thing crust and it was amazing! Service is good. Prices are decent. Not complaints."}
{"text":"When we pulled up to the parking lot we didn't think much of the place but once you step inside you get the feeling of an authentic Italian restaurant. The mac n cheese is great, good service and fast. Food was delicious, We even got a free Tiramisu cake. Overall it was a great experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"There's a Crust in Midtown.. Whaaaa?   I would have visited this place much sooner had I known about it since I work right in the heart of Midtown. I love that so many places are starting to pop up in Midtown now,  mostly because the parking is so accessible. This place has a nice big parking lot so you don't even have to park on the street.  The inside is also pretty spacious,  much nicer and more spread out than the Tremont location, which I feel is cramped and not well ventilated.  I usually order a speciality pie at the Tremont one,  but I ended up going for their slices since they were quick and easy. The price isn't bad at $5 and change/slice,  especially considering the size, but for the quality of the pizza you get,  it's basically like Sbarro's so I definitely didn't feel like I was getting some great deal. The crust wasn't as good as the ones I've had at the Tremont spot, but again I'm not sure if this is due to the location itself or the fact that I ordered one of the slices versus the pie made to order.   All in all I wasn't wowed or impressed like I was with the Tremont location, but I would return only because I have had good quality in the past from Tremont and would give it another shot solely based on that. Also,  if you're nearby and need a quick lunch,  this would be a great option."}
{"text":"Would never have noticed this place if not for Yelp. The storefront is quite small, and indeed the inside only offers a few tables, but I tend to prefer small restaurants such as these anyways. There is a small parking lot next to the entrance as well. We stopped in for lunch on a Saturday afternoon, I was actually surprised that their menu was as big as it was. Two of us decided to split a medium cappicollo pizza with the hand- tossed crust and an order of butternut squash gnocchi. We also ordered a slice of tiramisu to go- I was pleased to find that they had at least 4 different kinds of tiramisu to choose from! I decided on the butter toffee. We ordered up front, and the girl taking our order was very friendly and eager to provide recommendations. We waited inside, and our food probably took about 15-20 minutes, which is quite reasonable for a pizza place.  When our food came out, I did notice that the place only used disposable cutlery and containers, which I suppose is because they are mostly a take out place. In any case, the butternut squash gnocchi was delicious! A little sweet but well-balanced, and I was impressed to find such a dish at a pizza joint, this could easily be served at a fancy italian restaurant in little Italy. The pizza was also very good, although in my opinion Angelo's in Lakewood is preferable, the crust was still nice and crunchy while still being soft. The cappicollo had a nice spice to it, and I was happy to find that the fresh sliced tomatoes had a really delicious juicy tomato flavor (hard to come by in the winter time). We ended up taking half our food home because we couldn't finish it, and I'm happy to report it made wonderful leftovers! The tiramisu was a little sweeter than I prefer, but still I appreciated the toffee flavor, and would be interested to try other flavors in the future. I think this place would be great for a lazy night in take out option, and I am eager to try other things off their menu."}
