{"text":"Tried this place as well, was just as sad as the other. they dont open when they are suppose to be, given their posted hours, and the ppl are rude here."}
{"text":"I have been DYING for awhile to get me some RITOS from downtown.  However, the only time get to go is when I am off during the week since I work in Northeast Scottsdale but even then, I am off for my daughter's procedures.  I remember seeing the sign for this Ritos Burritos previously and thought they were stealing the fame to the downtown Ritos by using their name but NOPE! It's the owner's son who opened up this Glendale location and I am grateful for it!

I am not sure why people are whining over the atmosphere, what the heck do you expect going to 51st Ave and Orangewood in a sketchy shopping center?  Louboutins and Louis Vuittons?  The interior was bare but clean.  It is simple and to the point, just like the menu.  If you call, the voicemail says their hours for the day.  Also, how many OTHER eateries close at 5 or earlier?  Quite a few.  

I ordered the green chili burrito and a can of Dr. Pepper to go.  It was absolutely heavenly.  Just as I dreamed it to be!  I am just so glad I can get my Ritos Green Chili burrito fix on a Saturday!  Oh happy day!  Oh and the service, I thought was good!  No complaints.  I come here for the food, not the ambiance.  If I am looking for ambiance, there are places for that but none of them are at 51st Avenue and Orangewood... just sayin'."}
{"text":"Rito's is Rito's. It's been this way since day one. When you have a product that is filled with greatness and quality as theirs, you can pretty much get by with simple. Or anything that you want, for that matter. They are family oriented and obviously have more important things to do instead of trying to please everyone. All while incorporating pleasing your taste buds into their lives! This is a given, hands down, you will be pleased. So it's not a fancy spot. Some of the best places in AZ are small, family owned, \"hole in the walls\", and they have been running successfully for the same way for many years. Why change a good thing? Instead, be grateful that their family is sharing their goodness with us! Don't judge a book by it's cover and get your behind to Rito's! Stop at any gas station and get some cash, the location on 51st has a Circle K conveniently located in the same plaza. Buy something for a $1 or less and avoid the ATM charge. Don't forget to call ahead to ensure they are open for either location. It takes 2 seconds and they have a recording that tells you."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Some of the best green chili I've ever had (and green chili is always my go to when eating Mexican food). The taco was equally flavorful and delicious. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"I'm shocked, SHOCKED at the reviews for this place.  Puzzle this out with me: 

+ Take the top-rated burrito in Phoenix (Rito's \"downtown\" location has 4.5 stars, primarily on the strength of their legendary green chile burritos).
+ Keep the same menu (with food so good that it makes Carolina's look like Taco Bell).
+ Remove it from a tiny house in a less-than-savory South Phoenix location.
+ Add hours (including Saturday hours!)
+ Add indoor seating.
+ Put it into a more accessible location with less wait time.

Aaaaaaand... you get negative reviews!  What gives?

Bizarrely, the criticisms are on its ambiance!   This is incredibly ironic.  Nobody slammed the old Rito's for ambiance because there was NOWHERE TO SIT AND EAT.  It was a crowded little house with an aging air conditioner that worked overtime to try to keep the temps under 90 as everyone stood and waited.  Okay, there were outdoor tables and chairs, but in the Phoenix summer, that's not really an option.  

So now that the new location stuck a few chairs and tables indoors where you can sit in air-conditioned comfort while you wait, suddenly everyone's expecting a five-star restaurant environment!  What do you want them to do?  Start hanging the type of tacky decor most Mexican restaurants have around here - red and green sombreros, anyone?

Let's get this straight.  Rito's is NOT a sit-down-and-eat restaurant.  It is TAKEOUT.  You order, you pay with cash, you step aside, and you wait.  You pick up your food, go to somewhere more convenient, cut into the best wet burrito you've ever tasted, and go to food heaven.  (It's probably good to go someplace where you have a little privacy, because some people in our society still aren't comfortable with seeing a stranger weeping over the perfect burrito.)

The funniest part is that I think the new Rito's is designed to FORCE you to go somewhere else and eat your amazing burrito.  The place is so popular, they want the chairs open for people waiting for their orders, not people slowly burning their lunch break.  I noticed when I was there that they had purchased and mounted a glossy, pre-printed sign that said the restrooms were under repair.  Think about that for a minute.

I'll close with this.  My wife is an ambiance junkie.  She loves ambiance.  A beautiful restaurant could serve her a hot pocket and she would be content.  But Rito's is so darn good that she doesn't even care about the ambiance.  We grab the burritos, head back to work, and by the time we're two bites in, we're already planning our next trip.

It's that good.  Go get a green chile burrito enchilada style, eat it, and once the food epiphany has worn off, come back here and let's give this place the rating it so richly deserves.  Five stars.

P.S.  Always, always, always call to see if they are open before going.  Their hours and days can be a bit irregular (for example, they are now closed on Saturdays during the school year), and occasionally they'll just be randomly closed.  There's no heartbreak quite like showing up at Rito's and then having to settle for some other type of food instead."}
{"text":"I'm not much of a gambler but you kinda have to be if you wanna eat here and by that I mean they make up hours of operation based on if they wanna get out of bed for the day.  At first I was like okay I have to place my order through metal prison bars. I see why the bars are there, its for the customers cause it makes you wanna go upside their heads for the cashiers attitude, so I guess it's there to protect the consumer from going to jail. God forbid you have to go to the bathroom there oh wait you can't employees only if you ask to go your chances are they'll charge you a 1.00 per sq for toliet paper,but hey when in tijuana. Better off going to popos on 67 ave indian school."}
{"text":"Live right off Glendale and this place is NEVER FUCKING OPEN. As good as it is, the FEW times I do see it open, I refuse to step inside. They can't just get business when they \"feel like it\". So annoying."}
{"text":"Excellent green chili burro, but not the most customer friendly place. The girl taking my order wasn't particularly friendly but that's OK. I asked how long the wait would be and she said not long. I asked again in minutes, and she repeated, not long. I recommend take out as the dining area reminded me of a prison cafeteria. Twenty minutes later I got my burro and it was worth it. A tiny bit spicy but that's how I like it."}
{"text":"While the atmosphere at this Ritos location might leave a bit to be desired, the food is pretty delicious.  My favorite is the \"famous\" green chile burrito, which is just as amazing here as it is at the downtown location."}
{"text":"The food is so watery and very bland. Everything tastes store bought including the tortillas. On top of everything it's cash only and they refused to allow my 7 year old to use the bathroom!!! My kids also had to sit near what I'm assuming is the manager while she had a personal conversation with cussing every other word!! I will never go to this place again!"}
{"text":"The checklist.

1. Am I hungry?
2. Do I have cash/can I get cash?
3. Are they open?

After that I know what I am going to get.  Red Burrito Deep fried and maybe a taco or two, add a side of rice and I am good to go.  I don't mind that this place is in a strip mall and there is limited seating.  The drive home is just long enough for my food to cool off to be able to eat anyway.  You NEVER have to worry about their food not being hot enough.  For those concerned with the lines, the staff at Rito's does their best to keep the lines moving. I grew up walking distance from the downtown location and the food is the same quality. If not for inconsistent hours this would easily have gotten a 5-star review from me."}
{"text":"OMG...I cannot believe the whiners.  Sorry folks...but this place is part of the ghetto-fabulous food experience that made Phoenix RITO'S the best....and now they are sharing with Glendale.  The original Ritos is in an old hot house in the hood...like, in the freakin downtown ghetto...where white folks don't go at night without an escort.  They had horrible hours, long lines, limited menu...we LOVE them.  You want their good food..then plan your trip there accordingly...who cares about ambience.  If you want to look at pretty pics on the wall...go somewhere else and leave this place to people like me who appreciate good real home made mexican food.  THANK YOU RITOS FOR COMING TO GLENDALE"}
{"text":"Food
I've had the tacos, red & green chili burrito. After I had the chili burritos this is the only thing I get from this place. To my taste buds, these are the best chili burritos I've had. 
The chili is generous (always hot and smooth). The meat is good portion, not too much not too little. The tortilla is amazing. Only burrito sauce I don't let go to waste.

Interior & Exterior
It's not appealing to the eyes but you can tell they keep it clean and organized. It's just not nice interior or exterior. It's not a place you would want to eat at so just get to go. The interior is clean though, and the food is great. 

Cleanliness
Very clean. 

Price
Affordable. $5 for one burrito

Atmosphere
It's a family owned place. The atmosphere is very casual, whatever floats your boat."}
{"text":"The food is good, if you can catch them on a day they're open. They have posted hours but they seem to really be more like target times than anything... literally half the times I go there there seems to be a handwritten sign saying they're closed. Also cash only, so hit up an atm first."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Something amazing has happened! They're back to business as usual. Somebody grabbed the reigns and took back control of that runaway train. They now allow you to call in orders so you can save time. They keep their hours posted so you don't show up to closed doors.

I have to say it's an absolute step in the right direction. I wish you could hear me clapping right now. I wish you could see it too because it's kind of awkward in the bank right now. I don't care though! It's about Rito's right now, baby! Thanks for bringing that ol' thang back!!"}
{"text":"Still hands down the best GREEN CHILE BURRITOS in town.  Always friendly staff & great service!!!"}
{"text":"I usually visit this location once a month and spend approximately $17. Today when I got home I realized my bean and guacamole tostada had no guacamole, I called restaurant to advise and was told unless I can bring it back to show them, sorry out of luck! I live on 75th and McDowell, no I did not want to drive all the way back. I wanted to be believed and have a happy resolution but that didn't happen"}
{"text":"Runny beans.....every time. Cash only and just not that great. Did I mention the runny beans? Ugh."}
{"text":"This location and the Ritos downtown offer the best green chile burro you will find in the entire state of Arizona period, end of story."}
{"text":"Stopped in Ritos for their famous green chile burrito. Funny the other yelper mentioned it reminded him of a medical facility. It does have a very institutional vibe to it. Plain vinyl cream floors, white walls with only a couple of printed \"No outside drink\" signs on them, and about 5 cafeteria style tables and chairs. I believe there are even bars on the windows to the cashier as if you are cashing a check there. It reminded me of a place you would get a UA at in the hood. 

Besides the destitute decor the green chile is on point. For a little over 4 bucks you get a massive burrito that is filled to the brim with molten hot and very flavorful green chile. The tortilla is fresh and thin and goes perfectly with their homemade green chile. 

This is definitely a place where you want to take to go. They are very tight on the salsa. There is no complimentary salsa whatsoever. For a small salsa its like 27 cents. Not too bad. But the salsa wasn't very tasty. About the consistency of Carolinas but with less heat. 

Ritos is also cash only. No plastic period. Bottom line if you are looking for a tasty green chile burro to pick up on the way home and you are within reasonable distance and have cash on you, then Ritos is worth the stop."}
{"text":"Worth every single bite! And how far I had to drive to get here! Old school mexican food, take out. They have some seating area, outside. But who cares it's delish!!! I have been coming here since the 80's, so it's been around awhile now, they got it together. Your order is ready pretty quickly and spot on! I have had just about everything on the menu, and I have to tell you, you can hardly make a mistake here. I particularly enjoy the guacamole tostada, green chili burro enchilada style(house specialty) is to die for! And the beans, omg I'm in love!! The beans are creamy, smooth and succulent. It is worth the 40 mile drive, I'll always keep coming back"}
{"text":"What I did like: some whiney girl in front of me asking for a side of rice because there was no rice offered in a burrito. The Rito's guy just about went soup nazi on her \"no rice for you!\" They make their burritos their way. Order your food from a couple options of taco or burrito, and NEXT. This isn't chipotle. My burrito came quickly and very hot(as on heat) nicely. It also left me feeling healthier than expected. I didn't leave feeling like I ate a tub of lard. They open whenever the hell they want. I'm cool with their business culture. It's a nice hole in the wall feel. 

What I didn't like: it's just not my style of burrito. It was a purée blend of bean, cheese, and sauce. Kind of like it was mixed in a vitamix blender with water. When I cut into my burrito it was filled with liquid sauce that goes everywhere. There were a few square chunks of some kind of odd tasting meat. The meat wasn't terrible but wasn't great. The liquidy blend on the inside had a taste element of Taco Bell hot sauce. I don't dislike Taco Bell hot sauce, but would expect more uniqueness in taste. 

Overall the dining experience was worth a visit. I liked the overall vibe."}
{"text":"I've heard the tacos were great and decided to try. With the tacos I also ordered a side of rice. The tacos were great as told but there was something extra in the rice of the insect kind. I brought this to there attention so they could see. They offered to replace but no thanks. I left the tacos too."}
{"text":"Very frustrating to go by and see them closed at times they indicate they'll be open. Closed for weeks at a time sometimes a reason, sometimes not. Spring break, vacation, great food, but at some point we just give up and stop trying."}
{"text":"Love Rito's, I have been going to the original location for at least 20+ years and since we found out there is one closer to west phoenix I have been to this location many times sometimes weekly!  Great food same as the original location. Call before you go hours posted are not always correct and then they are closed sometimes for holidays and random days just be safe and call. Not much in the way of customer service, cash only, but I only come for the food usually to go. Few tables to dine in but nothing fancy just picnic type tables, area is clean and again food is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Okay where to start when the menu is so delicious. 

Tacos- are so flavorful and i would definitely recommend the guacamole tacos if you haven't tried them. 

Burritos- I've tried Green Chili, Green Chili enchilada style, and Green Chili chimichanga. I've enjoyed the flavors of all but would definitely say I liked the crunch of the Chimichanga style. They are worth every $$ and I'm always full when I finish (if I can finish). This is NOT a pick up and hold burrito it is a wet burrito. So expect that and enjoy all the amazing flavors while using a fork! 

Beans- I am also obsessed with their beans and truly feel no other mexican restaurants compare! I could go just for the beans. 

TIPS/Thoughts:
1. Call before going and bring cash
2. Who cares about the atmosphere when the food is amazing
3. If you get to know the family behind the scene you would be amazed at their grace and generosity
4. Enjoy the food! It's really great!
5. If any of the other reviews scare you away you are really missing out. Try it for yourself :)"}
{"text":"It was okay. The hours are sketchy, I spent my whole lunch break waiting for tacos. They really are not open consistently and its cash only. Meh! I like Lito's (no relation) on olive better. It's similar in taste, the staff is friendlier and they take credit cards. Just my opinion."}
{"text":"Good food. Really really bad customer service. Cash only and they don't have change to give. I think I would not come back unless they change the way they treat customers. The employees always respond to u like if they ate in a bad mood."}
{"text":"Just horrible. Food is bland and expensive. Seriously Filibertos might be a better option than this place. 

Customer service: there is none! I don't know why they run a business. You ask questions and forcefully answer with no sense of wanting the clientele, its just strange. From the other reviews and the sign on the window stating to call to ensure they are open this place can be close whenever they want. Surprisingly they are still in business. Lol.

Food: bland. No taste. Nor the green nor res chile is good. Absolutely bad. Burritos are all tortilla no meat. 

I wasn't a big fan of Litos but they are much nicer folks and food is 100x better than this place.

FYI - don't be fooled. They have no affiliation to Rito's in downtown(that place is actually good).

Take it from me(been to countless burrito places) If you really want to taste something good for a chile burrito. Go to La Canasta on 7th ave and Buckeye Rd. Now that place knows how to make food."}
{"text":"My fav place for green chili burritos!! Especially the enchilada style. Kind of hidden but next to circle K, bring cash only... made that mistake lol"}
{"text":"A friend told me this place has good green chili burros, and being a Green chili junkie I had to go. The restaurant is rather small, and the bars on the order window tells you it's not the best area of town. The food however is very good. 

I realized after eating the burrito that I had been to their store in Surprise. It's a much nicer place, but it is very small as well. The green chili they make is very soupy, so it's a knife and fork thing, not something you pick up and eat. This location was a little spicier than the Surprise store, which I liked. I may have to try the red chili here, since several people here like it. 

In this area of town I still like Caramba's green chili better. It's more meaty."}
{"text":"Best Green Chili burro in the valley. I eat at both locations a few times a month. I love Carolina's but Rito's Green Chili is better. I actually prefer the new location because the burritos are bigger and you can always get taco's.

If finding great Mexican food is your goal, check it out, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The only positive thing I can say about this place is their green chile is good. If you love bad service and rude employees then you'll love this place. 

They are also never open when they say they are , but if you call they at least have a recording that tells you what time they open. They close at random times so don't even follow that picture that says \"New Hours.\" For example just today I was craving the burrito I show up at 430 ( they're supposed to close at 5) and there are people in there but the door is locked, and they just look at you like your dumb for trying the door. On a separate occasion it was 10 til close and they just \"ran out\" of food. 

On several occasions I have seen the staff ,including the \"owner\" ,be rude to customers for no reason. I know it's a hole in the wall but you don't have a right to be a dick to anyone. Needless to say I will never go there again. Thanks for the awful service."}
{"text":"been  eating here since I was a kid out on 14 street always got to stop when im in the hood !"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of eating the food from here twice. Unfortunately, I'm not sure when I will be spending much more time in the area, but this is a definite choice if I'm anywhere near here in the future! WARNING: CASH ONLY. That being said, get a soda or something at the circle K a couple of doors down, ask for cash back, and you don't have to worry about finding the right ATM. The place had a line waiting for food to go both times. There weren't many people eating there, actually. The menu is limited, but it's authentic and delicious. EVERYTHING. No matter how you order it. You won't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was not to impressed with the food and definitely not impressed with the service. There is a limited menu that consist of vegetarian or beef. The only meat they offer is beef so if you don't eat beef you will have to dine somewhere else. This is a cash only establishment as well so make sure you have some pocket change. The prices are reasonable and the food is cooked to order. Don't plan on being greeted or getting service with a smile. The establishment is clean with a high traffic of patrons who order there food to go. So there is plenty of dining space."}
{"text":"I've been by 3 times and they're always closed.  I called today and they're only open until 6pm......Ya know, not everybody eats dinner at 5pm!!  PATHETIC!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an eating experience that is a combination of sitting in a medical office for people with no insurance / the unemployment line while being served food that makes dog food look appetizing... Then look no further, Rito's Burritos is the place for you.  

By far the worst eating experience I have had in Phoenix, since moving from East L.A."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, people who complain are complainers.  If you want delicious food go here or to their other 2 locations in Phoenix and Suprise!"}
{"text":"You guys are always closed, the food is getting worst I actually used to like it & who can ignore the horrible costumer service from the cashiers in the front. If you want real food and the best green and red burritos go to Lito's on 47th ave Olive they are awesome and I switched over to them, plus they're always open!!"}
{"text":"Delicious tacos and burritos horrible service and atmosphere about sums up this establishment. If the big scary guy is there watch how you order and how you remark about the food or you'll be barred for life like most of my family have been over the years. We have been going to the original house Ritos downtown for the past 25+ years. 

The crunchy hardshell shredded beef taco is probably the best you can get in the Phoenix area. All in all this place is worth. Even though the prices are kind of high considering what you get."}
{"text":"Where to begin! First off the area in which the restaurant is located is not the most pleasant. But don't let that scare you away because the food is amazing! The inside is pretty small and not suitable for large groups. This place is also cash only. Every single time I go to Ritos I get a bean burrito enchilada style. And it is soooo good!!!!! It's pretty big and I only finish half of it. They also have some of the best tasting guacamole tacos, at times it has a kick to it which I absolutely love. Their quesadillas are huge too and packed with cheese. Finally, the tostadas and damn delicious! The only criticism I can give to Ritos in regards to their food is the salsa. I think they can up the ante with it.
I would've given them 5 stars but their hours are always a hit or miss! I'd give them a call first to make sure they're open."}
{"text":"If you get excited by standing in line to get a number and then standing or sitting around again for your number to be called by a guy on the other side of a barred counter in places like the MVD you will absolutely fall in love with the place.  The rest of you will have to go for the food.  Which fortunately is quite good.  I had a red chile and bean burrito, enchilada style and it was very good.  Nice big chunks of tender beef, a little bit of heat, one of the best red chile meals I have had.  Only open from 11 to 6 Tuesday trough Friday with another sign that says to call for hours this place stays packed.  There are several tables to eat inside but most folks were take out and many took several bags of food with them which may be why things seem to move so slow.  Bring cash."}
{"text":"Fresh delicious food and fast. Menu not extensive and it doesn't need to be. I usually get the red and bean burrito and last time got it with cheese. Burrito filling is on the saucy side when you bite in, so I get a spoon to scoop it up so nothing goes to waste."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best green chili and tortillas in town! Been eating at Ritos for years and they never disappoint"}
{"text":"Great burritos but its cash only and they never stick to their posted hours. 3 stars sums it up pretty well."}
{"text":"Ritos is incredible! I actually go to the one Downtown, but couldn't find it on yelp so deal with it. 

The tortillas, OMG! Dying delicious.  The red and green sauce are good and all, but its the tortiallas that make Rito's so freaking good. 

The steak inside the steak burrito is cooked perfectly. Chewable, savoury, and chunks of steak, not little bits 

The place is bomb. The line is worth it so just enjoy!"}
{"text":"17.47 for three burritos that seemed more like wrapped soup than than actual Mexican food. Sloppy leaky beans and virtually flavorless red chilli. I still have the green chilli burro on the counter waiting for tomorrow morning. Hopefully by then I can eat it without changing shirts. I live close by and rarely see the place open so I stopped by when I caught the \"open\" sign on.......rare enough. Live and learn....."}
{"text":"Call before you go to make sure they are open. I have gone here numerous times, hoping for some yummy food, and been sadly disappointed they were closed. So now I always call ahead to see if they are open. All that aside, the food is delicious. Burritos, regular, enchilada or chimi style, never had anything bad. Tacos are great too. Drinks are can soda, maybe bottled water, not sure. I always get it to go, the booths look uncomfortable lol. Cash only. There is a Circle K a few doors down, so go there if you need cash."}
{"text":"DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!  Yes I used to love the food and I would go when I was in the area as the hours are very sparse. But NOT ANYMORE! This location has HORRIBLE customer service and doesn't care one bit about pleasing customers. My aunt's order was wrong and she went up to request they fix it and they argued back saying she was wrong(after waiting 10 minutes for someone to come to the window). I personally ordered the burrito and I know EXACTLY how I ordered it. They are extremely rude, very slow leaving people waiting for VERY long periods of time. Forget what you've heard about Ritos, they can't treat people this way. They have seriously gone down the toilet."}
{"text":"Normally I usually go to the surprise location,  and right now I'm glad.  this place doesn't even come close to surprise.  the wait time is ridiculous.  no chips? what the heck..
it is still Ritos and when I need the fix,  at least they are close to work.  Burritos don't come with hot sauce either...you have to pay additional. gay."}
{"text":"Decent food! Prices are cheap and quality is decent. I would give 4 stars if they put more meat in the dishes.

Hubby got the green chili beef enchilada and I got the green chili beef tostada. His dish was spicier than mine, and my tostada was very mild in spice. And I don't have a high tolerance for spice. My dish only comes with 1 tostada, but it is surprisingly filling for me (I'm petite) probably because of the refried beans."}
{"text":"Wow! A co-worker told me I had to try this. The green Chile was perfect. Not fatty. Just the right amount of heat (I like spicy). I can't wait to go back... in fact, it might be my dinner plan!!

This is not WHITE PEOPLE Mexican food for sure.

¡Que rico son! Estoy enamorado de Ritos y no puedo esperar por mi próxima visita."}
{"text":"A few of the reviewers were too rough on the place for the wrong reasons. Before you go you have to be aware this is a \"to-go\" burrito shop. Think of it as almost a street vendor burrito place, but indoors. You can eat there if you want, but it is definitely not the recommended way to fly. If your looking for a good sit down Mexican restaurant in the area check out Popo's a few miles away. If you are looking to grab a quick, forearm sized, wet, sloppy, flavorful burrito to go, this is your place. As the other reviews stated they do only accept cash, which can be a hassle if you don't have cash in your wallet. So bring some cash and make sure you get your burrito enchilada style, it's very much worth the extra cost!"}
{"text":"Have had better burritos. Tried the green chili  and the meat it self was bland. There was more green chili sauce than meat. I may have just gotten the one bad burrito experience and they may be perfectly good."}
{"text":"12-28-16. wouldn't know if it was good or not. read all the good reviews, so i figured i'd drive 20 minutes to give it a try. weds at 12:30pm. pulled in front of store, and big sign in window \"sorry, we are closed\" . WTF? who is closed at lunchtime on a weds? waste of time, driving in crappy traffic.

12-29-16. so i went back today, against my better judgement. had to try it. this time they WERE open. YAY!!! i think. 
eh. food isn't that great. maybe it was an off day? definitely not as good as all the reviews say. i was NOT impressed. good tortilla, average beans. red chili was spicy but not that good. took forever to get 1 burrito. not sure if i will be going back. most likely not

12-30-16. nope. never going back. as the day went on my stomach hurt worse and worse, and all night long i was evacuating my digestive system and in severe pain. shame on you rito's burritos. not cool. i should have walked back out the door when i saw you order through what looks like a pawn shop money window. iron gate for a front counter. took forever to get a burrito, and it wasn't really any good and then it made me sick?"}
{"text":"I cannot speak to many of the menu items because I get exactly the same thing every time I go:  A Wet Green Chili Burrito.  Hands down the BEST in town.  The ambiance?  Well, there isn't any.  The service?  They don't give a crap about you and they don't have to.  The prices?  This ain't no Bertos, but the food quality is fantastic and totally worth the $10 you will pay for this scratch made scrumptiousness.  Tender, lean pork, slow-cooked in a mild green chili sauce and wrapped in a thin authentic flour tortilla, and smothered in a spicy red chili sauce with the perfect amount of kick that will make you sweat in a good way.  

Mmmm.  Seriously.  MMMM!!!!!  If all you care about is spicy Mexican delicious...go here, order Green Chili, take it to go, and enjoy!!!  You're welcome."}
{"text":"Order from the app or call to avoid long lines. There's parking right next to the restaurant. The green chile burritos are everything! Get them every time we are in town and travel back with some frozen. The beans are also delicious."}
