{"text":"Tried the thousand layer matcha cake and it was just okay. It tasted good but nothing that wowed me."}
{"text":"When I walked into the small room, I was instantly greeted by a friendly face. When I asked for recommendations, he only mentioned sweet options, but that day, I didn't have a sweet tooth. I decided to get the Chicken Rabbit Food with an iced orange pekoe tea (they have a variety of tea to choose from). I thought the price was fair, but I waited for around 20 minutes before getting my crepe, a very long time for something that falls under the fast food classification. 

The crepe was warm, well-cooked and hearty. It was filled with cheese, tomato, spinach, chicken and spicy mayo. The spinach was fresh and the spicy mayo added a flavourful kick to the meal. But the tomato tasted off (it was possibly put in the crepe too early and wilted in the heat). The chicken did not taste fresh and it was underseasoned. 

Even though my first experience wasn't the best, I will return for the tiramisu crepe cake, which looks delicious and is one of their specialties. Who knows -  maybe that will change my rating."}
{"text":"Maybe 3.5 stars.

I'm not impressed by the texture (crepes) of their crepe cake Cuz I've tasted a few \"thousand-layer cakes\" elsewhere. It's just not as elaborate as I thought. And one small piece is a bit pricy considering the quality. But the taste is ok. 

Their crepe dessert (wrap) with cream, ice cream and fruit is more economical."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've tried their green tea parfait, their green tea Mille crepe cake as well as their Japanese special crepe everything was delicious and made with lots of attention, the staff is nice as well. The Only con is that they only accept cash or credit ..."}
{"text":"I stopped by just for the Khao San Road Thai Iced Tea ice cream! It's amazingly creamy but be warned, it will stain your teeth orange (Worth it though)! 

The store also sells their signature crepe cakes, and crepes (sweet & savoury). It's a small store so don't count on getting a seat, or coming in large groups."}
{"text":"Came here Saturday night hoping to get a slice of the millie cake but, as i expected, it was all sold out.  So, ordered the tango mango.  There was no way i was leaving the store empty handed.  How can one resist the smell of butter that filled the room up? 

The crepe was very soft and delicious.  It was nothing like the other crepe place i went to where the crepe was a bit crunchy after a few minutes. 

I'm planning on coming back first thing Sunday morning to ensure i get a slice.  I am so excited!

** update

So made here at 12:30pm sharp on Sunday and there was a small line up already.  We ordered 4 slices and eat 2 of them right away.   Went back in the line to order another 3 slices.  Took another big bite into the green tea flavor this time and was really impressed. 

Both original and green tea are pretty good.   Should have just bought the whole cake.  we took 7 slices hoping to take at least 5 back to our friends, but only 4 survived.  Lol"}
{"text":"I had a slice of the matcha crepe cake and it was divine.  It's not overly sweet and it just melts in your mouth.  Be warned that the cafe is tiny so seating is extremely limited for this very popular spot!  I will definitely be back to sample the other goods."}
{"text":"Japanese special is very tasty! Not overly sweet and crepe is soft and chewy! Good texture."}
{"text":"The green tea mille cake was absolutely divine.  It was a little pricey ~$9 but I just had to try it. The place is really small, so as soon as my friend and I had eaten, someone grabbed our seats ..BUT they also do take-out which is great so now you have no excuse not to try this wonderful place.  I hope these guys think about expanding and opening up another branch, this is going to be the next craze!"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this gem as I was walking to Kensington Market one day. Their crepes are by far some of the best I have ever had; I'd say better than any crepe I had while visiting Paris. Their crepes are Japanese style, so they are a little crispier than your average crepe, ensuring that every bite is free of the sogginess that I've experienced with countless other crepes. Their whipped cream is freshly made, with a creamy but light texture and just the right amount of sugar. 

Their gelato is also fantastic--made by a friend of the owners. I sampled almost every flavor except for the lemon (which I only didn't because I felt bad for sampling so many flavors!). A scoop or two of gelato in their crepes or solo is definitely recommended. If you're feeling adventurous, try an affogato with the green tea flavor; it's a shot of espresso over a scoop of ice cream. Delicious.

The owners are SO incredibly friendly and kind. I can't wait for business to pick up at Millie's once more people hear about it, since their product is so fantastic that many of their customers will be loyal ones. After first stumbling across it, I went the next two days in a row too; the only thing stopping me from going every day is the fact that I had to go home to Boston. 

The only caveat is the location; it is on a side street off Spadina surrounded by a bunch of random stores that don't have nearly the same clean, modern vibe as Millie's."}
{"text":"Millie Creperie is a lot smaller than I had expected. The sweet crepe menu is on one side, while the savoury crepe menu is on the other. You can take a peek into their freezer to see all of the gelato flavours they offer. Over the counter, you can also watch your freshly-made crepe or parfait being assembled.

The moment we stepped into Millie Creperie, we were greeted with friendly smiles all around and the cashier kindly offered her suggestions for us first-timers. There is only a few small tables and chairs inside the little shop, but several chairs are placed outside as well. 

I ordered the Japanese Special Crepe (strawberry, red bean, green tea gelato with a drizzle of matcha sauce and a dollop of whipped cream). The crepe was soft, but the best part was the green tea gelato (...better than Hime green tea ice cream!) with the matcha sauce. 

My friend ordered the Mango Parfait (layers of strawberry, blueberry, cornflakes, and whipped cream, topped with a scoop of mango gelato and chocolate Pocky). The size was a bit disappointing for the price we paid, but we enjoyed it, more than the crepe (however, green tea over mango...any day!). It's just a whole different dessert, but at the same time...one can easily re-create this at home.

I can't wait to return to Mille Creperie to try a slice of their Green Tea Crepe Cake and one of their savoury crepes."}
{"text":"The mango parfait is perfect for semi-lactose intolerant folks like me! It's made of amazing mango gelato, whip cream (dairy), and corn flakes! Simple but  refreshing and delicious! The people there are really friendly and the little boy there even helped me open my Ramune drink ;) Thank you! I had such a great time there!"}
{"text":"The green tea parfait was a delight even though I was expecting more ice cream than corn flakes. The place is pretty small so its not really suitable for big groups."}
{"text":"Tried their famed Mille Crêpe cake and Japanese Special Crêpe. I don't know what else to say, but: soooo good! I'm a fan. :-)

Mille Crepe cake: Velvety whipped cream sandwiched between delicate layers of soft crêpe - heavenly! A great treat that's not too sweet. 

Kind staff, good ingredients, a small place to sit-in."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's brand new and just opened last week. Everyone was really friendly and the crepes are a Japanese style. They use gelato instead of ice cream so it was really light. The place is also really clean and small, i would really recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"The creperies that my wife and I had seemed to fall a little short of what we craved when we were in Harajuku.  The crepe was in a sense correct that it didn't have any colour to them which is what a crepe should be, but the fact is that they are too soft.  In this case they may need to have a little more colour to provide the cone some more structure.  Other than that, this place hit it on the nose so we'll be heading back.for more."}
{"text":"I have been there two times.   I really love crepe myself especially the \"Japanese kind\" because of its unique small chewy but still soft and smooth texture with a thin fine thickness.  it gives you a very good feeling when you bite on it.  That's the first store I have ever taste in Toronto that can remind me about the crepe I have eaten before in Japan.  It's crepe is not too sweet, but it gives a really good smell already when they give it to you.

Second, it is their home-made Gelato.  My wife loves the green tea, but I like the mango a bit more.  Again it is not too sweet with enough flavour of green tea and mango.  Together with fruit that wraps with the crepe is the wonderful dessert that I have tasted.  (Tips)  The staff is quite friendly because they are willing to give us a small try on those gelato that we are interested.  So you probably should ask them about it if you are suspicious with the taste.

I know the place is sort of hard to find and tends to be small without enough chairs.  But I can bear it because of its quality on the crepe.  (so be prepare to take out if there is no seat)   But if you love crepe, yes, you got go to there to try it.

One thing I have to mention is their enthusiast on perfecting their recipes.  The staff there are really friendly and willing to chat with us about them and also their new recipe.  You know, it is an enjoyment when you can eat, study and also appreciate the good food.  :)"}
{"text":"I tried the green tea Millie crepe and my friend tried the original one. They were really nice! I love the green tea one because of the tea smell and the little bitter taste. That's what I love!"}
{"text":"Wow the Gelato is amazing!! Cant get enough. I also recommend the Crepes they are famous for them !"}
{"text":"This is a review of their crepe cakes. I tried both the plain/vanilla and the matcha ones. They are heavenly. 
I first discovered crepe cakes from the famous Lady M cake boutique in New York. These are very similar if you have tried the Lady M's crepe cakes before. Basically layers of very thin crepe alternating with layers of cream. Well worth the calories and the $8 a slice"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that this is the best place I've been to for Japanese crepes, well, crepes in general. 

Everything is made in front of you, the batter smells fresh and its soft and fluffy when you eat it! It's not filling at all so you can have it as a nice dessert even if you're full! 

This place is probably one of the best places I've been to all summer. I definitely recommend the Japanese special and/or the crepe cake. 

The atmosphere is very peaceful but small so don't bring a large group there unless you're planning to take it to go. During the summer they do have limited outdoor seating which is good considering how much space they have.

Anyways, great all year round dessert, even better in the summer though. 

The staff are really friendly and cheerful. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try the crepes and parfaits, but I came in on a busy day and ended up getting a slice of their green tea crepe cake instead.
One slice of the crepe cake cost around $8, which I thought was a bit pricy. However, I understand that making crepe cakes take up a lot of time and energy, which definitely paid off in this case. The cake itself was one of the best I've ever tried. It was light, creamy and left me wanting more. The green tea powder on top gave some nice flavour and texture.
In terms of the interior of the shop, it is incredibly small and only has three tables. You're better off getting take-out, if possible. 
The service was great. I had to wait a bit before I could order because of how busy they were, but the server was very friendly. Overall, the crepe cake was amazing and I'm really looking forward to trying their crepes and parfait next time."}
{"text":"Amazing gelato at affordable pricing! They accept credit (square!) Or cash only. No debit but that's okay!"}
{"text":"Crepe cake -  We had the layer cake and it was very good. Filling was perfect and the crepes well done. Keep cold not very good once starting to melt.

Gelato - it was some of the best I've had in the city so creamy and tasty. 

Service - was outstanding staff very friendly and helpful. 

Not a lot of seating but really meant for a take out place. 

Can't wait to go back :)"}
{"text":"Love it! Especially their green tea crepes and parfait! Not too bitter not too sweet. You've got a fan!"}
{"text":"Tried the green tea crepe cake and Japanese special today.

Loved the green tea crepe cake, the crepe layers are so thin and the cream in between layers are very creamy and light! 

The Japanese special was comparatively not as good. The crepe itself was really good. It's kind of hard to eat it as the whip cream was all to one side where the ice cream was off to another side. Loved it still though!"}
{"text":"Had the green tea crepe cake. This is pure deliciousness. It melts in your mouth. It's super creamy and rice. I split the cake with a friend as one slice would be way too filing for me."}
{"text":"Millie Creperie is amazing! It totally lived up to the hype. 

I order the Japanese Special Crepe (around $8) and it was probably one of the best desserts I've ever had. Each crepe is made to order so it can take 5-10 minutes to make. The crepe came with matcha ice cream, azuki (red bean paste), whipped cream, strawberries, and topped off house-made matcha sauce. The crepe held together a lot better than I thought it would and remained crispy to almost the very last bite. It also came with so many more slices of strawberries then I thought it would. 

The sitting area is also very small. There's about 4 tables, so if you're likely, you might be able to grab a seat but most likely, you'll be taking it to go.

I can't wait to come back and try their millie crepe cakes!

Atmosphere: 2/5 | Service: 4/5 | Price: 4/5"}
{"text":"Came here for the layered cake. I got the champagne one, it tasted really good and I really enjoyed it. The cake is very sweet (but I like it that way), very light, and creamy. Wish I had more of it. I want to come here again to try their parfaits. In fact, I want to go there to try every single thing on their menu. They are a bit pricey, but hey, I don't know where else I can get these desserts."}
{"text":"Amazing cakes, amazing icecream and friendly service. It was my first time here, I had the Japanese crepe, Green tea crepe cake and khao san road ice icream. I know, Im a pig *oink* But seriously that cake makes me look a other cakes differently, I cant eat cakes from anywhere else anymore.... :,( they all suck now. 

We told the staff it was our first time here and they were excited for us. They helped us with our order. 

Ill differently come back for that one slice of heaven."}
{"text":"After having some Ramen @ Ramen Isshin, strolled on over to here after all the good reviews on yelp.

Got the earl grey mille crepe, black sesame and thai iced tea gelato. All were ok. Personally it's a little too pricey here compared to the quality/price of other places for crepe and gelato in Toronto. Everything is about 3$ more than it should be. But it's good!

Seating in almost non-existent here. I was lucky to have seating, but it might have been because it was raining and I luckily reached here before it really started to pour. No matter though, you should plan to do a walk and eat after going here or sit on the curb and enjoy Kensington market.

Service is really good, I forgot something and one of the busy servers even ran after me outside to return my items. So nice of them. I will come back to try some more flavours of mille crepe and gelato when I'm in Kensington market again."}
{"text":"After my hair cut next door, I felt like I needed a mini snack to get me power walking to bay & bloor for dinner.

Next door is Millie's, perfect.

I didn't get the crepe-styled dessert, only the green tea gelato. For 1 scoop = $3.95 with tax.

The gelato had a smoothness. Not too soft-servce or the hard frozen solid. Rather you can enjoy the GT flavour to linger after each bite. It had the sugar rush I was looking for. There were menus posted on the window. 

The promise of Japanese crepe with green tea is worth a re-visit in the future."}
{"text":"Green tea gelato. Ummmmmm! Love it. Like the feel of the place. Lets go again! kind staff, good ingredients, looking forward to my next visit which is going to be real soon."}
{"text":"Their Japanese crepe cakes are the best around! Each crepe later is paper thin and they have more than 20+ layers per cake. The store is very small though and it was super stuffy, but other than that, they're great!"}
{"text":"Millie Creperie is a tiny place in the heart of Kensington... so tiny that we managed to pass by it. We had to look really hard on the way back to find the place. We were hoping for a cosy corner with some warm drink and dessert, but the place was absolutely packed. It didn't strike us as cosy either - a hole in the wall, really. We took 2 slices of the matcha crepe cake to go (@ almost $9 each) and off we went back into the cold... And therefore the 3 star rating. The cake was good, but with all the hype around it I was expecting more.
I may give the sister-cafe, Millie Patisserie & Creamery, a chance..."}
{"text":"Loved it! The nutella banana crepe was amazing! Perfectly wrapped up in a cone which made it easy to eat. Just the right amount of nutella and whip creme. We tool the original crepe cake to go .. and it was WOW!"}
{"text":"These crepes are amazing. The banana crepe with Nutella is something out of this world. They make the crepes right in front of you. It is like watching food porn!

Unfortunately, the place has only three tables and it is packed most of the time so you would have to wait 10 - 20 minutes to sit, unless you want to have your crepe to-go and end up with a whole mess when you get home.

You must try a piece of crepe cake: 20 layers with whip cream in between. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm addicted to the Pork Belly Okonomiyaki Crepe.  Fresh ingredients, great service, and a bright cozy atmosphere.   

Lots of choice with the dessert crepes - Japanese special is my favorite."}
{"text":"Fixes my crazing for Japanese style crepe desserts! The shop is quite tiny with very few seating, if you go on a weekend afternoon it will probably be full. So it is probably not the place to go if you have more than 2 people, unless you are fine with waiting or you get lucky and there are spaces for everyone!

I recommend the crepe cakes. They are light and fluffy. I wish the green tea crepe cake they serve have an ever stronger green tea flavour, since I love love love green tea flavoured desserts!

Will definitely go back to try out their ice cream crepes when the weather is warmer!"}
{"text":"Who knew ice cream and corn flakes can be so good. Small store with limited seating, but the area is great to walk around so it doesn't matter much. Went on a weekday afternoon and no crowd. Well done Millie for providing a unique dessert option."}
{"text":"I've been to Millie Creperie twice now, and both times I have been beyond impressed. The crepes are delicious, as other reviews have mentioned, and you really can't go wrong with any of them. The owners are super friendly and very helpful. I'm looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I've had a matcha ice cream stuffed crepe, original cake, and mango parfait. It's good, the cake is the best of the 3. Every dessert is really expensive imo for what you get. For example, in the parfait there were 2 scoops of ice cream and mostly corn flakes and a few fruits and whipped cream. It should not have cost over $7.  The cake is also over $7 and you get one small slice, but I know a lot places in downtown charge that much for a cake slice. Great markup. Overall I don't think you get value for money. Also, both times I went the staff was passably nice, nobody makes you feel welcomed or goes out of their way to smile. 
I'm very surprised that other reviewers were much more pleased with the desserts, there are a zillion better places in Toronto and the suburbs. 

Verdict: 2.5/5
Not planning to return here"}
{"text":"Small places. I waited ten minutes for a seat(you can take out of course).
Simple warm deco.
Straightforward menu.
I ordered the green tea crepe cake and the Japanese special.
The cake is superb. It is super light, not greasy.
The Japanese special is actually not special. Kind of disappointed, maybe I am not a fan of gelato.
The service is really good. The staff are friendly and always trying to help out.   
May come back  for the cake."}
{"text":"The dessert crepes are good and much more filling than they look.  I do like Millie's better than the Parisian creperies nearby. But they're nowhere close to the better ones in Japan!  You may find yourself running out of gelato, whipped cream and sauce towards the end.  This 'unevenness' is a bit of a letdown...  Every time I come here to get my crepe fix, I end up craving Japan's Marion Crepes even more! 

If you have to have a crepe, I'd go with their savoury ones. Rabbit food + chicken ($6.90) is awesome though messy!  Get plenty of napkins if you plan to takeout/eat on the way. 

I'll stick with their crepe cakes. Prefer Lady M's firmer and more refined texture but this is as good as it gets in TO.  Comes in original and matcha flavors. Get them early as they tend to run out!"}
{"text":"Very nice little place. Very tasty cake, almost as good as Lady M to me."}
{"text":"One of the places I'll miss about Toronto! The Japanese special crepe is so delicious, but a bit pricy. I love all their matcha offerings... great flavours and not too heavy."}
{"text":"In simple terms: when you mix french and japanese together, you get Millie Creperie.

Seriously one of the best mixture of desserts ever invented in Toronto. I got the Japanese Special and it was definitely worth $7. Tons of matcha and a huge scoop of matcha gelato to top it off - nothing will beat this. 

Another cool concept with this place is that you can build your own and it's just as delicious. 

The owners are extremely friendly and won't ever rush you to order. Plus, you can ask to try the gelato before you can settle on which one you want in your dessert.

I'm so excited that this has been a new addition to Kensington Market - I'll definitely be back and the parfaits are staring me down."}
{"text":"The crepes here are tasty, but not worth the price ($6.50+ for sweet $6.90+ for savoury). They don't serve it up on a plate, so I felt rushed eating it in fear it would get messy with the melting ice cream. 
Not a lot of seating, but would imagine that turnover is quick."}
{"text":"Been here a bunch of times and it's always been good. 

However I went the other day and got the Khao San Road ice cream. Got food poisoning about 2 hours later. 

Never going back."}
{"text":"The creations at Millie Creperie are fantasmical. I like their crepes A LOT.

After dinner in Kensington, my friend and I mosied over to Millie's in search of dessert. Countless Instagram photos lured my taste buds to make a visit, and I'm so glad I did.

We both opted for the Japanese Special: Green Tea Ice Cream, Matcha Sauce, Strawberries, Whipped Cream, and Adzuki Bean. It's their best seller, and with good reason.

The crepe itself was tender and lightly sweetened. It's made from scratch the old-fashioned way. No pre-made mixes here folks!

The gelato, made in house, had a wonderful texture. Dense and creamy. Total win! 

Each of our crepes was inhaled within minutes. They're really that good.

Moreover, we got to meet the owners Christinn and Carson who were just as sweet as pie (P.S. They do have seasonal Pumpkin Pie and Apple Pie Crepe. Get on them before it's too late). 

They're in the midst of working on some savoury crepes that they plan to introduce soon. One of them is Okonomiyaki inspired with Pork Belly. Nom!

I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"they have good crepe cakes, but a little bit over priced.

and this is not a tip, its a review. seriously!
and i can repeat saying that this is not a tip, it is a review!!"}
{"text":"The Japanese special crepe at Millie creperie was pretty good but a little too expensive in my opinion. The crepe only consisted of one scoop of green tea ice cream, strawberries, whip cream and matcha sauce but the total came to $8.25."}
{"text":"Best Japanese Mille crepes I have ever had!!! Way too excited when seeing my Japanese Special Crepes and forgot to take a picture. They have green tea parfaits also I havent had a chance to try but sure the treats are worth every penny! Their green tea cream is soft and \"chewy\" (?!). It doesn't melt easily but not icy either. Not too sweet, just \"enough\" like most Japanese treats. They are so perfect to me  The size of the crepes is quite big and is about $7 (included tax) when I bought it. Definitely going back if I am in the town again."}
{"text":"Had the millie crepe cake and it was amazing. The taste was out of this world and really made me want more. My only gripe is the hefty price tag. Close to $10 for one slice of cake...it was definitely worth it because of the great taste, and understandable since they have to layer so many crepes, but I wouldn't frequent this place because of it."}
{"text":"Long overdue review. I first started coming here some... almost 2 years ago? It was newly opened and anything having to do with green tea and crepes... I'm in! Went in with a few friends during a late afternoon. Staff was very welcoming and friendly - answering any questions we had.

The crepe was delicious, fruits were fresh and the gelato was heavenly! It's a small shop with some seating, but can get very busy. I've been back ever since and recommend this to friends who want dessert within that area."}
{"text":"Great snack spot. Not always consistent but usually very enjoyable"}
{"text":"Small shop located at kensington market. Japanese own and the logo are cute. I tried their green tea cake and Japanese special crepe. Very good ! Good service and very clean, but their seat are few, 3 small tables only. I will come back again."}
{"text":"Have been meaning to come here for a while after hearing all the rave reviews! 

Mango tango crepe ($5.95) - mango gelato was great.  A bit awkward to eat but very good.

Green tea crepe cake- beautiful.  It was light and you could taste the matcha!"}
{"text":"Very Authentic Japanese  drinks , cakes, ice cream  , and there crepes are  the best ive ever tried  in Toronto, well priced and  you get a very nice helping.
The People are Very friendly.    they do take  debit  i believe but  when i went   it must have not been working,  the cashier told me there was a atm next door  just  down the street a bit ,  so i went out  to look for it (it was  very cold  night)  he noticed i wasn't  sure where it was , so he came out  with out a coat and  took me there  and pointed  it out ,  he went  out of his way and was very kind. i felt a bit  bad  because  it was so cold, but  at least it wasnt  far at all , but i still appreciate  his  kindness. :)  this  place  is  awesome !  so please check it out next time  your in kensington market! :D"}
{"text":"I had the Japanese Special Crepe (includes green tea ice-cream and strawberry slices). It was delicious! I'm not into whipped cream and wish there was more ice cream and less whipped cream, but overall it was very fulfilling. I definitely recommend coming here if you're in the Kensington Market area."}
{"text":"I've been dying to come here and try their crepes for so long and I finally did today! It was crowded and people keeps coming in although it is a Monday. This place is small but enough for 3 small tables. Their crepe cakes are absolutely delicious, tiramisu is my favourite, original is great as well, green tea is okay. Their crepes with ice cream aren't as good as I expected but if you want to order one I recommend the Japanese special!"}
{"text":"Millie crepes are already packed into a box so we couldn't see the cake until we bought one. Anyway, after all good reviews, we wouldn't go wrong. We tried the original millie crepes; soft & not too sweet.  It was so light that I didn't feel guilty after finished a slice.  4 stars
Kids tried mango parfait which is a layer of corn flakes with whipped cream & mango ice cream then another layer of corn flakes, whipped cream & mango ice cream.  3 stars
I would give 4 stars if topped it with real fresh mango pieces... Anyway, just my little suggestion.  
Do I have craving for their cake & parfait?? No to be honest with you....
No washroom.  Only 4 small round tables & few folding chairs & stools outside the store."}
{"text":"The Thai Iced Tea ice cream alone is worth a visit. I haven't had any of the savoury crepes yet, but the dessert ones are delicious (Mango Tango is my go-to). Last time I had the Green Tea affogato (green tea ice cream with matcha) - it's good, but the flavours are pretty strong."}
{"text":"The cake is delicious but the people are not of integrity. They promised to give one cake for free after purchasing 10. I have bought ten cakes already and my card has ten seals on it. Yesterday I bought a new one and use the card,they said they put two in the bag but ended up only putting one. I was so disappointed by their cheating, and the cake is not fresh as usual but had some bad soy flavour. I won't buy anything here"}
{"text":"Got the green tea parfait last week. The corn flakes go surprisingly well with the rest of the parfait! Will be back again and again for more :)"}
{"text":"Note that this review is just for their special crepes. Was a bit too plain in that there was the usual fruit, ice cream, and matcha. But other than that it doesn't really wow you that much. Maybe some of their other appetizers are better but their crepes seem quite standard."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! Great customer service and delicious crepes!

The green tea crepe cake was really something but what took my breath away was the Pork Belly Okonomiyaki crepe... It was an umami symphony in my mouth. My eyes were rolling to the back of my head - it was that amazing.

I don't really have anything else to say, the crepes pretty much speak for themselves. This place is great."}
{"text":"Really yummy, I want to come back so I can try more on the menu!!!! A bit small and not a lot of seating but its ok :) A bit expensive, so just a treat for me occasionally."}
{"text":"Definitely not good for a sit-in unless it's the odd time of the day. My friends and I got take out after dinner. I had a slice of the green tea mille crepe. I love matcha for its bitterness, which I actually really liked on the crepe. If you're not a matcha fan, I would suggest taking the top layer off as it is drizzled in a layer of matcha powder. The crepe was soft and airy, very light. The layers of cream in between were fluffy and bittersweet. Towards the end though, when I was eating the rounded side of the cake, the cream to crepe ratio was becoming too much and it was just like eating whipped cream. I definitely suggest eating it with coffee or tea. Also, I didn't refrigerate the crepe for a couple of hrs before eating it -- big mistake. It left the cream warm, which was probably why it felt like it was becoming too much towards the end. I would get it again to see if the refrigerating makes a difference."}
{"text":"This is my current preferred place to satisfy my Japanese dessert craving because the line at uncle tetsu's is still ridiculous. 

I love their green tea mille crepe, although it is not at lady m's level. If lady m's mille crepe is about looking and tasting like french patisserie, the mille crepe here is about a what-if-your-japanese-mom/beau made a mille crepe for you. Basically, it tasted homey and full of love(as cliche as that sounds).

I was going to drop a star or two, but this place just wouldn't let me do it. One day, I came for a slice of their green tea mille crepe, but before I could dig in, I noticed that there's what look like a HAIR(!!!) sticking out from between the crepe layers. I let the girls know and like me, they're also making 'eeeww' faces and sound, but in japanese. 

They looked so apologetic and offered me a free scoop of ice cream (I chose their khao san thai ice tea flavor, which tasted amazing btw). All this happened around closing times, in other places in Toronto, that would be the usual I-wanna-go-home bitchy time. I was impressed by their service, hence I couldn't drop a star even with the hair on my food."}
{"text":"I liked mil crepe since long time ago. I did not know nowadays there is a green tea mil crepe. It was good, but it was overpriced. This shop is very small and there are only two seats. The staff  were flirting each other and customers could hear it. Be careful!"}
{"text":"So yummy! Partner loved the japan crepe and i loved the millie crepe! We will be back to try the thai iced tea ice cream."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, it was not crowded so I got to sit down and enjoy my crepe.

Food: I only tasted the Japanese Special crepe. It tasted yummy, strawberries and green tea gelato throughout every single bite! They also have a wide variety of savoury crepes too. And limited edition specials such as pumpkin pie crepe and apple pie crepe.

Atmosphere & Service: Service was great, the staff were willing to answer questions and provide details about the items on their menu. The shop is small and cozy.

Pricing: For something different in Toronto, I would say the price is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Amazing. Adorable
Location and friendly staff. A bit cramped but still good. The banana split crepe was amazing. The okonomiyaki crepe was similarly delicious. Really overall good. Good price good taste good quality. 

Not too much to say as it's all simple food but it is worth it! Go! I waited months and I regret it. Cannot wait for the hot weather to go get more!"}
{"text":"I've been there on 2 different occasions and had the crepe cakes, green tea and the regular.  The staff is nice, but they definitely cut the slices very small and it is not worth the price $8.59 with tax for the green tea crepe cake slice.  It's all hype, the cream they use is tasteless."}
{"text":"Ever since I've had my first mille crepe in Tokyo, I've been on a hunt for them. When in New York, I attempted to line up and visit Lady M, only to be let down when it was sold out right when I got to the counter. 

Fast forward to this day in Toronto. My friend and I were exploring Kensington market for some eats. After a delicious taco at Seven Lives, we had to stop here for dessert. 

The smell of sweet crepes lingered in the air. They had a lot of options on their menu- all different kinds of crepes, and also, a selection of homemade ice cream.

We each ordered a slice of the matcha mille crepe cake. No sharing. We got the nook seating right by the window, which was a great escape to the sudden rain outside. We savoured the cake. I loved it. Layers of layers of thin and light crepe, with a layer of cream, and with matcha powder dusted on top. This is a must for all matcha lovers!"}
{"text":"The crepe cakes look, smell, and taste amazing. My favourite is the vanilla or tiramisu. The ice cream is just okay though. I wouldn't recommend it, especially when you can order a delicious slice of cake instead!"}
{"text":"There are some days when you just feel like crepe!

Strolling through Kensington Market on a pedestrian Sunday, I made my way over to Millie Creperie.

This tiny shop serves up Japanese style crepes, layered crepe cake, and some hot snack items.  The crepes are easy to eat in crepe cone fashion with a tiny spoon!  I was able to grab a seat  by the window (the place seats like 10 people).
  
I had the most popular dessert item, the Japanese Special crepe with green tea gelato.   The strawberries, fresh cream, matcha sauce - everything was sweet, creamy, and green tea perfect!

I will have to come back for some of the other items for sure! :)"}
{"text":"Always come here when I'm around Kensington market. This place is humbly small but have amazing crepes at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Very tasty savory crepes and quick and kind service. I tried the tofu and mushroom and loved it. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This place is perfection. The first time I came here was a week after it opened and the two owners were still preparing the crêpes and cappuccinos. 
This will always be one of my favorite dessert places. Located between the entertaining Kensington Market and Chinatown. 
Go here. You'll love it."}
{"text":"Every time I come to the Kensington Market, I always make a visit to Millie's. I've had their crepes, parfaits and gelato and nothing has ever disappointed :) Everything is fresh and just the right amount of sweetness. My personal favourites are the Japanese special crepe as well as the green tea parfait, a must-try if it's your first time there!!"}
{"text":"An oriental delight
A supreme crepe cake
A sublime matcha
Konishiwa!

Funny fact: A proper Creperie in the middle of a mess of a neighbourhood. This should be in queen west.
Sad fact: I am allergic to dairy
Win fact: Worth the rash. (Yum the savory crepes)"}
{"text":"Went around 10pm on a Saturday night and it was quite busy. The store is small so there aren't many tables but there's a bunch of stools outside that I find way cuter to sit on with friends. 

The green tea gelato in my crepe was yummy, the flavour was strong but wasn't overwhelming. The crepe overall wasn't that amazing. I felt like most of the sweet/dessert crepes were the same with regards to the fillings (strawberries & whip cream) and the only difference was in gelato flavours. 

It wasn't too expensive either but it didn't wow me enough for me to be going back anytime soon. However, if you're looking a cute little spot (with great customer service!) and a not too sweet dessert then it's not a bad place to check out."}
{"text":"Fresh Japanese crepes that taste of eggy vanilla wrapped around savory or sweet things. Don't come when you're absolutely starving because you may have to wait a good 15 or 20 minutes before you get your order; there's always a good crowd during the weekend. I keep coming back. I had the parfait and the chicken wafu crepe. The latter is plainer than the former, but it's still ok given how rich a crepe actually is."}
{"text":"Heard good reviews of this place, and decided to stop by when I was nearby with family. Tried the Japanese Special crepe, Mango Tango crepe and the Banana Split parfait. The kids absolutely loved it. The strawberries used were very fresh,. The crepe was very soft and light and not too sweet which went well with the ice cream. I would definitely come again!

The store is a bit hard to find though as the sign is not very visible (well... at least for me it wasn't)."}
{"text":"When you first walk in the door all you smell is crepes. It's wonderful. Even though it was the dead of winter and negatives I was told that Millie's was a must. I was not disappointed. The ice cream was a great texture, light, and refreshing. The crepes were really nice since they're freshly made to order. 

There's not much sitting room, just a corner window and two tables. Not somewhere you'd want to go and hang out in groups, but definitely worth the stop in."}
{"text":"Based on my 2 visits to Millie on Baldwin on back to back Saturdays, I would gave a 3.5 star rating. On February 11, 2017, I ordered the green tea parfait. I ate a smoked salmon crepe and had a slice of green tea Millie crepe cake on February 18th.

My green tea parfait was yummy! It was as tasty as it looked in the window poster. See photo. The next week, I saw someone order the mango parfait. It even looked more colourful than the green tea parfait. Millie's visual presentation of their parfaits is so nice. It makes so appealing to eat. The green tea ice cream was tasty, the azuki red bean paste was not too sweet, the whipped cream tasted fresh.

I thought the smoke salmon crepe was good. It came with fresh spinach leaves. I would have like more smoked salmon included in the crepe. Also, there was only a very thin layer of cream cheese. I love a thick layer of cream cheese. Not much pickled onion was added in the crepe.

My green tea Millie crepe cake came pre sliced and already in a box ready to go. I thought that was strange. Order an expensive slice of cake and it's already boxed. In comparison, Pusateri's bakery at Saks Fifth Avenue Eaton Centre is selling their cake slices for $6. The crepe cake was delicious. There was a rich taste of green tea. When I cut into the cake with my plastic fork, it felt mushy. The cake slice was refridgerated, but I'm not sure if the cake was old or it's suppose to be kind of mushy. I will have to make sure when I order a cake slice the next time that the slice comes from a whole fresh cake from the glass display case.

I will be back to try other items from their menu boards."}
{"text":"This is a classic Japanese crepe place with sweet and savory options. I came here with my friend and tried their parfait this time which is also amazing! I'm a huge fan of the matcha and red bean combo on any dessert. Their green tea parfait was exactly what I was looking for. The corn flakes were a great addition for that crunchy texture contrasting the creamy ice cream. 

If you are craving a dessert while at Kensington market, give this place a try."}
{"text":"Visited this spot numerous times and shocked that I have yet to sing it's praises. Every time I have came here it did not fail to disappoint. Quality food and great craftsmanship in their delicious desserts. Lately Kensington market has been setting the bar for me as my last 3 reviews from the area have been nothing less then 5 stars! They are doing something right! 

Note: on my last visit I discovered they now make charcoaled flavor crepe cake. $10/ piece. And it's flippin amazing!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night for some dessert, and decided to try their signature mille crepe cake and Instagram worthy parfaits. The small shop was completely empty when I entered, with only the server / cashier on shift. He was super kind, and let me try the different gelato flavours before deciding on one. He even mentioned that I could substitute any gelato flavour in my parfait. Though he suggested coconut (his favourite flavour), I ultimately decided on green tea (a classic) and black sesame (my favourite!). Mango is the most famous one, but I didn't try. While the Thai milk tea certainly was unique, it was a bit too sweet for my liking.

The server stated that the other Millie branch is more famous for crepes - in fact, the crepe cakes at this place are made there and transported here. That said, during my visit, a lot of individuals still ordered the crepe. Their crepes smell so delicious; so sweet and buttery! Next time, I must try it. 

I ordered the green tea parfait, but replaced one of the green tea gelato flavours with black sesame, and asked for no whipped cream. The green tea gelato was delicious - not too sweet. I'm a huge matcha lover, so I would have appreciated an even more bitter and richer taste. I loved loved loved the black sesame though - it hit the spot perfectly. The cornflakes added a great crunch, but I was stuffed by the end of it. I only wish that there was more red bean filling in the parfait.

My friend ordered the green tea mille crepe cake, along with a matcha latte. I tried a bit of the matcha mille crepe, and found it okay. It wasn't very fragrant, but was quite sweet. The crepe layers were thin and light, which was nice. 

Overall, a cute cafe, but I think the appeal would be greater in the summer where people can take their orders to go. The physical store is a bit dingy and small, and its products suit the summertime more. It's also a bit on the pricey side (the total for the cake slice, latte, and parfait came up to $22), particularly for the piece of cake, which cost $8."}
{"text":"10 stars!!! The best desserts I ever had in Toronto. Absolutely love both their crepes and cakes."}
{"text":"Green Tea Crepe Cake: 3.75-4/5 
Ambience: 3.5/5 (Does the job for a quick desert)
Service: 4/5 Friendly unpretentious staff 
Repeat: Yep. Going to try the ice cream crepes :) 

Welcome addition to the neighbourhood"}
{"text":"I was on a hunt for the mille crepe cake since trying it in NYC and that led me to Millie Creperie.  Unfortunately, they are still perfecting their recipe so my mille crepe cake craving will have to wait, but that didn't stop me from trying other items on their menu.
The shop is small and quaint. Half the shop is the counter and their open 'kitchen' display their crepe hotplates and gelato. The other half is a bit of seating and a table. There are a few seats outside, perfect for a nice day.  The staff is very friendly and enthusiastic in showcasing their menu.

I tried:
- Mango parfait (approx. $6)
Layers of frosted flakes, whip cream, mango gelato, strawberries and blueberries with 2 pocky sticks. Good combination of texture.
- Savoury Cheese crepe (approx. $5)
it was A-Ok... simple with a hint of sweetness from the crepe.

The price is a bit high, but it's worth a try.  Waiting for the day Millie Creperie perfects their mille crepe cake... then I will be back!  For now it's 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Having visited Lady M in New York, I've been craving a good mille crepes cake for a long time coming.

We discovered this inconspicuous shop in Kensington Market at the recommendation of a friend and made a visit as quickly as we could.

While dollar-value is not the greatest at this dessert joint, the decadent cakes are almost as good as I remember. I just wish Millie Creperie was a larger operation so I could order whole cakes more conveniently."}
{"text":"I was disappointed by Millie. A lot of my friends have been going here and raving how the cakes were so delicious.I decided to give it a try when I was in Toronto for a day to meet up with a friend. First off the crepe cake was expensive. It was close to $10 for a slice of the crepe cake and it wasn't even that great. It was a bit overpriced in my opinion. The cake tasted cold and slimy and it was too bland in my opinion. I have tried a lot crepes before, and Millie was not a good experience. Also the fact that the woman who I had ordered from was rude and talked to me in a very condescending way did not help at all. It's very unlikely that I will be going back to eat their cold, tasteless cake ever again. I would recommend going to Uncle Tetsu or Tsujiri instead for japanese dessert."}
{"text":"Popped in here for a quick Millie Crepe binge. Ended up with two Millie Crepe, an original and a green tea crepe. I prefer the original crepe to the green tea but they were both delicious.

We also got a savoury crepe - the Okonomiyaki crepe which was good but I wish it had a bit more filling. Nonetheless, everything was very well made and will definitely return especially since the mister has a sudden obsession with millie crepes and they're so close to my office!"}
{"text":"Decor
Clean, small, seating for 8-10 inside, around 6 outside. 

Service 
Very friendly

Food
We had the Japanese special crepe - sliced strawberries neatly arranged, great tea ice cream in the middle and red bean paste throughout. 
- the fillings were all arranged evenly throughout so every bite, even the last has a little bit of every ingredient. 
- crepe was well made, soft, chewy a little crispy around the edges"}
{"text":"There is no bathroom on the premises, so, I had to go to a small vegan restaurant across the street. The restaurant (if you can call it that) can seat about 7 people. The bill for 2 crepes and a piece of cake came to approximately $30.00 - with suggestions that the tipping be 20%.

This may be an interesting idea, but, it is uncomfortable (especially when you need to use a bathroom).  Crepesz around the corner, although their prices have increased, at least provides a bathroom, has fair number of tables and chairs and makes good crepes and lattes."}
{"text":"I absolutely loooove desserts but I would say I'm pretty picky about them too (those extra calories have to be worth it, right?) So I was very pleasantly surprised to find this quaint little gem in Kensington. When I say quaint, I really do mean it but really, its perfect to grab a crepe and take a stroll through Kensington Market :)

As for the food, I love the crepes. The staff make them in front of you and they are nice and thin - just the way crepes are supposed to be! I prefer the savoury crepes (especially the Okonomiyaki crepe) and the parfaits, which look soo adorable (#instafoodie). Their gelato is also really good and there is a pretty good range of variety. I've had the espresso one and also the green tea (which is even better in the parfait). The best part is, everything on the menu is super affordable as far as crepes go. Most things are under $10."}
{"text":"hesitant to walk in due to its location, but on a sunny afternoon and another group heading in, finally came here!

great service and often thanked for waiting for the aforementioned group that went in previously

japanese special crepe - freshly made, lots of filling, fresh ingredients, just a tad difficult to handle with it served/wrapped in parchment paper

also, there is limited seating
would love to return"}
{"text":"Perfect dessert place after a nice stroll in Chinatown and Kensington market ~ The place itself is not highly renovated and it only has two or three small tables for seat-in. There was quite a lot of people lining up both to order and waiting for their crepes to be made. 

The menu items were quite expensive, but worth it in my opinion. We ordered a matcha crepe cake. It had so many layers and it was so soft and creamy. The matcha wasn't bitter at all and the flavour was there. We also ordered the matcha strawberry crepe. It was so good! Filled with matcha ice cream, strawberries, and whipped cream, etc. It was quite difficult to share, but we managed with spoons."}
{"text":"I had a green tea parfait. It had a nice presentation and it looked beautiful when taking a picture. However there were only two scoops and some cereal with cream and strawberry topping and it costed me 7+$ (incl. tips). Next time maybe I'll have a crepe instead of an ice cream."}
{"text":"Really cute place right on the edge of Kensington. Using crepes as the ice cream cone is an awesome and yummy substitute! The location and the white and black colours offer a simple and open atmosphere. I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"It was ok, overpriced, forgettable. The only good thing from this place is the crepe cake (which was pretty novel when they first open). Be aware that for $8 you're gonna get a really small piece of that cake."}
{"text":"I didn't like their Japanese special, but that's more of a personal taste thing than a quality of food/service issue, so I won't hold that against them.

I liked some of their savory crepes though, and their parfaits taste pretty good to me. Service isn't outstanding by any means, but I still get a nice smile whenever I drop by, which is more than enough for a take-out kind of store.

Wish there was better seating though, since the few tables they do have are usually taken up quickly."}
{"text":"I came here on a recent trip to Toronto after seeing the Yelp reviews. I got the Japanese Special which is a crepe filled with green tea ice cream, fresh strawberries and whipped cream. It was delicious!

The place itself is pretty small, with 2-3 tables. I did feel like the item I got was a bit overpriced, but I really enjoyed it and would get it again. 

Great place to stop in for a treat!"}
{"text":"This is an update to my last review. Here's what I liked: Early grey crepe, thai ice cream. Veredict: Good but way too pricey (~$10-11 after tax for a slice!)"}
{"text":"Confession: I had Millie's Green Tea Crepe Cake for breakfast. 

I've been drooling over the photos of this cake the past two weeks before I succumbed to cursing over to Kensington on a rainy Saturday. 

The cake was light, creamy, and full of matcha flavor; definitely worth every calorie. I could have easily consumed an entire cake. A slice of the 20 layer Green Tea Crepe cake will run you $7.60+tax (cash and credit only). Inquiring with the staff, a whole cake (looked to be ~10-12 slices) would cost $79. Orders must be made at least 3 days in advance. 

I'll be back on a less chilly day to try their gelato. They had some interesting flavours including pandan and khao san thai ice tea. 

They also had an array of savory and sweet crepes and Japanese snack foods on the menu. Although the shop is small, there was comfortable two seaters and a bench seat at the window. 

Eat here."}
{"text":"A wonderful experience.  

I knew that the Japanese had mastered the art of creperie but had not yet tried their interpretation of a Crepe. I am impressed. 

The Crepes are not drowning in syrup or sauce or lathered with cream, which is welcome relief from the norm. The sweetness is not excessive as it is in some other restaurants, also a good thing. 

The use of green tea ice cream is especially lovely. 

Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and quick service.  Got 2 crepes. First one was a savory one Tori Crunch.  Corn flakes and chicken. It was a little odd.  The dessert crepes was a lot better. Got the Japanese Special with green tea ice cream & strawberries.  There were 4-5 tables inside and 2 other doors."}
{"text":"Small little place that I compleeeetely missed while I was on the search for it! So if you are planning to come here with friends, pick and choose WISELY cuz you can bring MAX 2 other friends if you want to dine in...otherwise this shop can hold max 8-10 people.

I came here on a Thursday afternoon because I was having that dessert urge again and when I arrived there was just another couple sitting in the corner. I proceeded to order the original Millie crepe since the Tiramisu one was not available (soooo sad!). That crepe alone is the reason why I gave this place a 4 star. It was awesome! As I'm sure you probably read the other reviews before mine, it was just perfect! A perfect combo of lightness, fluffiness and tastiness! Each bite just made me anticipate the next and kept me wanting for more. I can only imagine how good the matcha and tiramisu flavours could be! It was so yummy.........that I decided to try their Banana Split Parfait too! Just to see how it was and if it was good enough. Of course, it could not compare to the crepe. It was like any other parfait but oh well, something to make a note of!

The service was the usual as it wasn't busy and I didn't have to wait long for either orders.

So yeah if you want to come try this place out, their crepe cakes are the stars of the menu. Everything else is just extra. I will definitely be back to try the Tiramisu and Matcha flavours!"}
{"text":"The best Japanese crepe ever!!! The Nutella and banana- every layer is just right yummy can u open one up in Philadelphia ???"}
{"text":"Best place for black sesame gelato! Mango is also good. Tried the crepes and parfaits but they aren't really my thing although they look really cute."}
{"text":"The green tea cake was very creamy and delicious, however it didn't have a superstrong green tea flavor. Overall I liked it though."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to visit this place for sooooo long and finally got the chance to do so! I tried the Japanese special and I loved the green tea gelato and the texture of the crepe. Not to mention I've always wanted to eat this style of crepe after seeing in so many of my favourite animes ='] .Service was also really friendly, and they were thoughtful enough to give me an extra spoon for my order so I could share with my boyfriend! I can't wait to return to try their savoury crepes, and the mille crepe! As of now though, I feel like I haven't tried enough of their menu to give them that extra star, but when I have tried more of their menu, I hope to be able to upgrade this review to a 5 star =). If only summer can come sooner to justify the gelato eating!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend to try their crepe cake. When I first got there, I expected it to be bigger - and perhaps less grey (?) looking. There was indeed a line up when we got here (roughly 2pm on a Saturday afternoon). But it moved quick, so not bad at all. I  only saw 2 types of crepe cakes: original and matcha green tea; there was also a variety of ice cream, sorbets available on the side. The one that struck me the most was the chai flavor (definitely going back  for that one next time).

I ordered the matcha green tea crepe cake. At first I was very surprised at how much it cost. With tax, this one slice of cake comes up to around $8.50 or so - may be less or more since I don't remember the exact cost. This is...quite a stretch. But let me tell you, this had to be the best crepe cake I have had!! Maybe I just haven't had enough in my lifetime, but this is hands down amazing. If I had to describe it, it was like eating fluffy matcha clouds. A slice of matcha heaven. GAH SO DELICIOUS! I usually have an opinion about the value of foods (cost to quality ratio). But this one was a bit hard to determine - because it was just that good; yet still pricey...I wouldn't buy this regularly, but it's definitely going to be a craving item for me in the future. 

I haven't tried the other foods, so there will definitely be a future trip."}
{"text":"This place is an interesting find as they make one of the better crepes around. The crepes are paper thin and they have got the batter part down pat. 
I wanted to try their crepe cake and partner in crime went for the Japanese crepe. 
The crepe cake was quite good and has a nice delicate balanced taste. The serving is a bit small as I was craving something substantial afterwards. 
The Japanese crepe though good  was very hard to consume the way its served. The green tea gelato was good and even though we asked for no red bean paste it was still in it. I wish it was served in a plate.
Will Revisit. 3.5 Stars"}
{"text":"Milles creperie (Toronto)

To start off, I'm not a fan of green tea desserts because it kinda tastes like fish to me how ever odd that might sound. I tried a spoonful to confirm and that's about as much as I had. My girlfriend on the other hand liked it a lot so that's all I have to go by. This place is a small grab and go place and the service was friendly and efficient.  

PRO TIP: the mille crepe would probably be more my style"}
{"text":"the taste of the crepe is definitely not worth the price. Try 8 turn crepe in NYC plz. 
and the crepe cake s definitely OVERRATED. Lady M in NYC is way better than this and not as expensive. 
(one unhappy detail: I asked if they could change strawberries in the Japanese Special to banana, the staff kindly said yes and the crepe came with strawberries at the end. So why did you say yes in the first place? Respect your customer plz)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try the green tea millie crepes cake for the longest time and finally had the chance recently. 

I thought the cream was very well done, light and refreshing with the right amount of green tea flavour. The crepes were thin and it was a delightful treat overall! The piece of cake did cost quite a bit but was worth the try.

I will be back for the gelato at some point, the flavours they offer seemed very unique (khao san road thai iced tea, coconut, black seasame). The store itself is quite small with only 2-3 tables of seating so I would definitely take out if possible."}
{"text":"Best crepe I've ever had in Toronto. I had the Japanese special... it was just amazing (not sure how to explain how delicious it was)! My boyfriend had the mango one, and he loved it. I wish I lived closer because I would definitely eat it everyday and get fat. 

They're really friendly and smiling all the time! Also, they use Square (cool!).

It's a very popular place, so expect a little bit of a wait. There are some seats inside and outside, but it's a small and cozy place. Would go there again!

They have savoury crepes, but I love dessert crepes too much to try anything else."}
{"text":"Service wasn't that great on a monday afternoon, they only had 1 person working at the time. I've had gelato with cornflakes in it before so I felt the parfait wasn't really for me, the crepe cakes were also really pricey (although its their signature item). I opted for 1 scoop of the Khao San Road flavour gelato which is basically Thai Ice Tea which happens to be my favourite drink! 

The gelato was sooo creamy and delicious, the only criticism I have is that it was a tad too sweet, thai ice tea is a pretty rich drink with condensed milk but I felt in a gelato form sugar needed to be cut.

Very small crowded area... hardly any seats inside."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a crepe cake and decided to try the green tea one. It is a tiny place which could easily be missed when walking too fast. I enjoyed every bite of the crepe cake since I love matcha a lot. While eating it reminded me of drinking a Starbucks green tea frappucino. I would come here again to try the other flavours!"}
{"text":"Got the green tea parfait. Love the combo. The bitterness of the matcha and the sweetness of the azuki and cream made the balance. Will come back for other flavours"}
{"text":"Lovely friendly staff and yummy yummy treats. The sorbets are all fantastic and the crepe cakes are delicious and not overly sweet. We got the Japanese special crepe with the green tea sorbet and it was absolutely delicious. Loved it!!"}
{"text":"Very cute place with very delicious food! Most food offered are desserts such as cakes and ice cream but I also saw savory crepes on their menu! My friend and I share the matcha mille crepe cake and the matcha ice cream parfait. Both were great treats and not too overwhelmingly sweet! The establishment was a lot smaller than expected but was still worth the trip, and the customer service was on point. Our ice cream scoop fell on the floor and they happily replaced it for us. Definitely want to stop by again next time I'm in Toronto!"}
{"text":"Visited this place a while back while my friend and I were walking around Kensington. Crepes were delicious and would definitely stop by again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"staff- super friendly and nice, they aren't pushy at all and will help you find a crepe you like if You don't know which fabulous flavor to pic :D 
food- instgram worthy crepes and mhhm i love their gelato not to sweet and it doesn't have an over whelming taste of cream(heavy cream) It's true the toppings do go all the way down to the last bite :D
value for money- honestly yes 7.5 dollars is a bit expensive for me but honeslty there is no other crepe place in Toronto that gives nice crepe gelato in a cone and has topings that go all the way down and has a costomizable menu. i had millie in Tokyo and the crepes was only 500yen which is like 5$ here :) IT'S TASTES BOMB"}
{"text":"I tried Original Crepe cake, Banana Split and Mango Tango.

The original crepe cake was surprisingly delicious. You should try it before you judge its appearance! The texture comes from the custard cream(is it custard?) and countless layers of thin crepes; perfect combination. I ate mine at home. The take out package is neat and nice; my two cakes are placed in a box, and it comes with a safe paper bag. When I got back home, my cakes are all safe and not damaged. 

The crepes I tried were also fantastic. (I personally like crepes) I think it won't ever go wrong with ice cream and crepes! All perfect but that would be 200/100 if the crepes and fruits were thicker. All in all, food in here is definitely worthy to try out, and enjoy your time in a small and friendly Japanese shop!

Reminder: Only cash and credit cards accepted. (No debit cards) Also, there is no washroom in the shop."}
{"text":"Would I come back? Yes.

Between the sweet crepes and the crepe cakes, I'd come for the crepe cakes. Delicate, light, and delicious. The sweet crepe was pretty ordinary. 

It's a small place with minimal seating, but we didn't have trouble finding seats for two the two times I've been at night on a weekend. And not that this is something that affects the food, but they have an iPad payment system that asks you to tip before you've even gotten the food or any service (ugh!).

If you're looking for a casual dessert spot for a small group, this is a good place to visit."}
{"text":"Came here for dessert after trying another food joint in Kensington.  We ordered the Japanese special and the Green Tea parfait.  The Japanese special was a crepe and the Green Tea parfait had similar ingredients (green tea ice cream, red bean paste, strawberries, whipped cream) as the Japanese special except in a cup instead of crepe and had corn flakes - weird huh?  My husband wasn't crazy for the corn flakes.  The crepe was good, but not spectacular.  I'm not craving it again.  It's great for people who don't like super sweet desserts but I guess we got a little bit of a sweet tooth :)"}
{"text":"Toronto version of Lady M. I tried both green tea and vanilla flavors. The green tea doesn't  have the bitter taste that M has. So I prefer the green tea here."}
{"text":"came here with a few friends after a long night out in the city. i've always seen Japanese style crepes online but never tried in person until this night. freshly baked crepes filled with yummy Japanese inspired dessert toppings. the price was pretty reasonable too considering it was a good sized portion of crepe. the only bad thing about this place is its very small inside and can be really tough trying to move around when its busy. but other than that, id like to come again to try the crepe cakes !"}
{"text":"I am a big fan of crepe cake and I came all the way from uptown for their crepe cake. I got the tiramisu cake. However, it didn't taste as fresh as before. The portion seems smaller and the price jumps up to $10 after tax. It's good cake, but it's not worthy of the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"Small shop with some great Japanese desserts.  Only a couple tables inside and outside. 
 Service was friendly.  Tables could have been cleaner.

We enjoyed the desserts we had.  Green tea crepe cake with lots of layers.  Japanese crepe which had matcha sauce, green tea ice cream, in a crepe cone, with some strawberries."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in the Kensington market!!! This place would be amazing in the summer after a stroll in the market. I had their crepe cake which is one of a kind. It's 20 layers of paper-thin crepes and they had original, tiramisu and green tear. I tried their tiramisu and original and fell into heaven. They also had a crepe with mango once team and strawberries. The ice cream was super refreshing.

The best thing I love about this place is the amazing smell of vanilla extract and the price!! Only $5.99!!

The only downside is it's not really meant as a sitdown place since there are only three tiny tables and chairs. Lucky me I came in the winter so t wasn't that packed but their line up of customers never ends. I will be bringing my friends back to try the other flavours and their parfaits as well! Oh and also parking is a hassle since its downtown but it's totally ttc accessible."}
{"text":"Fresh and delicious. I would argue less gelato would be better on their sweet crepe so I could enjoy the crepe more."}
{"text":"Came here twice and I still plan on coming again because it's just too good! 

I ordered the Japanese special crepe and the crepe cake. Both were delicious and despite the crepe cake being pricey, it's understandable  that crepe cake requires plenty of effort and time to make this i find it fair.

The service was great as the staffs were very friendly band welcoming!

This is more of a personal opinion but felt as if they put too much whipped cream. Yet I could've told them to put less cream therefore I'm still giving it a five."}
{"text":"The green tea flavor here is my favorite in Toronto. The japanese special crepe is a treat!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan! The japanese special crepe is awesome. Their green tea gelato is delicious. It's decently priced as well! 

I also tried both their original and matcha mille crepe cakes (layers and layers of crepes with cream inbetween to form a cake). It was really good, but is it worth $7-8 a slice? Mm, I'd say probably not. I preferred the matcha one over the original, but my friends seemed to prefer the original. Just depends on your taste buds I guess. It's worth a try! Unique texture for a cake."}
{"text":"Crepe is thin and very crispy!! Ice cream is creamy and fruits are fresh. A great snack to eat while exploring the market."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review on their green tea Mille crepe. I was super excited to try this place since I read a lot of great reviews about their Mille crepe cakes. The crepe itself was meh, nothing special in my opinion. I thought the crepe didn't have much taste. I think I would've liked it if it was sweeter. The cream in between the crepes was ok. Overall I am not impressed. I don't think I will be coming back, I really don't get the hype about this place."}
{"text":"I love this place for dessert! This place is so cute and wonderfully put together - a hidden gem in Kensington. 

I love this place for their famous Japanese crepe with green tea ice cream, some strawberries, and Pocky. It's light and so refreshing. This dessert is made perfectly - not too sweet, not too bland. It has the right amount of sweetness and the smell of the crepe is the die for!

When I drop by around the Fall, they also had a Pumpkin pie crepe with ice cream, pumpkin pie and caramel sauce. Everything they make here is a work of art - so carefully decorated and so tasteful!

The best part is, it's really not that pricey and it's definitely worth the dollars spent! Unlike going to Demetre's and spending around the same price (and sometimes even more) for regular crepes, at Millie's, it's 10x better because it feels more personal...and it's definitely more delicious!

Love love love this place!"}
{"text":"I came just to try the green tea crepe cake. It gives Lady M's crepe cake a run for its money, but way more affordable and without the ridiculous line. The seating area is cute too, and I wouldn't mind spending a while to enjoy some snacks while studying."}
{"text":"crepe cake was really good! fixes my craving for lady m! i wish they had a greater selection of crepe cakes though. will be back to try the other crepes!"}
{"text":"I was afraid that this is another place that wants to charge \"The Japanese Premium\" where the food is not authentic and all they do is scribble some Japanese words and hire Japanese servers. Fortunately, this place is legit! Yay!

I've been to Japan. I can't say you'll find the exact same crepes in Japan, but the style and flavors used here are definitely very Japanese. They have things like tofu and mushroom crepe. Relative to Western crepes, the desert crepes are less sugary and the entree crepes are less \"heavy\". This fits Asian taste buds perfectly so even though you probably won't find the same thing in Japan, I'd give this place the thumbs up for authenticity. 

The prices are not as expensive as I thought, especially considering this is actually authentic. However, I still don't think the price-value ratio is there. So it's not a place I'd frequently visit."}
{"text":"I ordered a wafu chicken. The chicken was tasteless, overcook and it did not taste fresh. Really disappointed, won't be back for another visit."}
{"text":"Will definitely be coming back to this place for more delicious crepes! This place is absolutely amazing! I don't think I've ever had crepes this good before. The crepe was very thin and perfectly cooked and they put the perfect amount of \"toppings\" inside. It did not feel very heavy and I didn't feel guilty afterwards either :) the Japanese special crepe is my favourite!"}
{"text":"The tiramisu crepe cake and the vanilla crepe cake are out of this world. I think about them still. Honestly a slice of pure heaven! A bit pricey, next time will try and see how much a whole cake is. Honestly never had anything like it."}
{"text":"The crepes here are very good. We (my husband and I) tried the banana split and the Mango crepe.  I loved the ice cream gelato added to it.  The prices also are a big win, so iif you are looking for a tasty dessert after a nice meal, I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Where else can you get a lychee crepe with nutella and matcha green tea sauce?? Here!!

In the heart of Kensington, is this small crepe shop, just opened and I can imagine the long lines ups out the door pretty soon, but although there are a few places to sit, the crepes are designed to be eaten on the road. After making them, she wraps it up like a cone. 

Although very cool, its a seems a bit of a problem for me who has sensitivity to ice cream/cold and cannot bite into a scoop of ice cream (and cringe when I see others do it). I didn't get a crepe with gelato, but I would imagine for me it will be both messy and extremely difficult to eat - be warned. 

Their menu is limited for now, but still very unique:
- green tea crepe bases (for extra 50c, but didn't seem different from a regular buckwheat, but seems thicker than the 'Parisian' crepe and therefore not as soggy)
- strawberry/lychee/banana/blueberry
- fresh whipped cream (it's good)
- nutella/matcha green tea/red bean/chocolate sauce, and gelato (green tea, lemon among some of them). 
I think the only thing missing might be Black Sesame ??? :)

You can get one of the pre determined combos, of make your own - and if the flavours dont' go right, they will let you know or ask for recommendations! I got a Lychee Green Tea Sauce with Whipped Cream and the lychees were sweet enough to balance the flavours. 

You can also get their gelatos without the crepe too. 

They also have a few options for savoury crepes too which I wish we tried - some other reviews only mentioned a cheese one, but there is also a tofu mushroom, and smoked salmon and you can add an egg on it!

Just looking at the menu again makes me want to go back asap."}
{"text":"3.5 

I've always had the Japanese special crepe (green tea ice cream, strawberries and whipped cream) whenever I visit this little store here on Kensington. But I think they raised the price recently because it's. 7.50(?) now. 

Anyway, there can be a lot of people so waiting time varies. I haven't tried their crepe cake so I can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Amazing food and beautiful presentation. They are a very small shop so not many places to sit, but their parfait and crepes are very good. Go here for authentic Japanese crepes!"}
{"text":"I first walked in hoping I'll be able to order and use the bathroom cause I had been walking around downtown for a while, but they didn't have any bathrooms so I had to go elsewhere to find a bathroom. 

Came back, ordered a green tea millie crepe cake, and a green tea crepe. The millie crepe cake was amazing. The layers were really thin and it all tasted amazing in your mouth. The green tea flavor was rich enough. I have to say the crepe was alright in comparison to the crepe cake. 

The green tea crepe cake is $1 more expensive than the original flavored one. It averaged around $7 or so for the crepe cake. The cake slice itself wasn't really big either though. 

I would come back just for the green tea millie crepe cake for sure."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the ice cream parfait I had here with one of my friends. Its a small tiny shop; great to come in or sit outside of the store for some ice cream. The staff was very friendly and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"My goodness! This place is amazing. This was on my bucket list for a while. The reviews are true - it's so good! 

This is a quaint little place (like most in Kensington Market) with about four tables. Get them while you can! 

When you walk in, you're greeted by cute decorations and photos as well as the pleasant people who work here. 

The menu is pretty extensive on the savoury crepe side, as well as the dessert crepe side. 

I had the mango parfait. The mango gelato was so unique and light, very delicious! The cornflakes seemed like a strange combo but like a lot of strange combos, it was so good. It worked. The presentation is also very cute. 

My partner had the banana crepe - great presentation and easy to eat. It was very delicious as well! 

Glad we came here on a quiet Sunday early afternoon! 

The price is also very fair."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Kensington Market! It serves excellent Japanese style crepes, ice cream and crepe cakes. I've heard many great things prior to going and they definitely did not disappoint.

I got a Japanese Special Crepe and a slice of their Original Crepe Cake. The green tea ice cream within the crepe had a nice rich flavour and a creamy texture. The filling inside was just the right amount and the crepe had a nice slight crunch! The crepe cake was definitely the highlight. It was light, not too sweet and very moist. 

Overall, this place was super cozy and had great desserts! Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"Good for this crew!!! Not only did they gathered +300 check in, but their products are original and delicious.

We were feeling the craving for something sweet and the reviews of this place made us curious. 

The premises are small and they don't really have decoration. They display the two kinds of cake they have, and they put the flavour of their ice cream in Japanese an English.

I asked for a green tea cake to go, and it was really tasty. It had lots of tender and juicy layers of crepes, and the icing was perfect. 

I think the mango ice cream was the thing I liked the most, but unfortunately it wasn't mine. My husband told me that he would've preferred it to have more ice cream and less corn flakes and cream. For me the corn flakes gave a nice chunkiness.

I definitely want to go back for a litre of mango ice cream."}
{"text":"The good: if you like crepes, they are good.
I only went to try the crepe cake of which they have several flavours. While I was in there 2 ladies were buying to take home and told me the tiramisu is good. The matcha was the other favourite of theirs.

I had good ole vanilla custard in mine. It's tasty though I know it would taste better if it weren't so cold.

I'd like to try the savoury next time.
The not so good:  Pricing is ok $8 taxes in for a small slice.  I'm not sure I'd come for dessert again as there are other places in town with great sweets for that price point."}
{"text":"Friendly service, delicious food.
Sweet crepes are FANTASTIC, 4 stars only because I didn't love the one savoury crepe I tried."}
{"text":"Their crepe cakes are as good as people make them out to be. The cream is smooth, velvety, and each bite melts in your mouth. It's light and airy and isn't overbearingly sweet. Apart from their cakes, they also have an assortment of sweet and savoury crepes. I wasn't a fan of crepes prior to having their cake, but I may have been converted. I'll definitely be coming back to try their other crepes. Come here with friends and get them to share with you so you can try multiple items! 

Their cakes are quite pricey, I paid almost $9 for a slice. It's still definitely worth a try especially since it's not as widely available. 

The store is quite small just like most of the places in Kensington market, so I would recommend taking it to go. 

Service was quite quick, but I came right before closing on a weekday. They also take Amex, which  I always give brownie points for."}
{"text":"Thousand layer cake. More like 20 layer cake but damn, every layer is a bite of soft, velvety heaven. 

Came here to get a single slice of the famous Japanese-style crepe cake, specifically matcha. I was pretty surprised that it cost almost $9 for a slice but given the craftsmanship that goes into it, I think it's justified. Every layer was paper thin and sandwiched between matcha cream.  It was a perfect size to share after a meal, or just to indulge yourself (it's pretty filling with all the cream). 

Service was friendly and quick. Since we were eating in-store, they provided us with cutlery and dishes that were actually quite fancy and dainty. I saw a sign that said if you didn't pre-order a cake within a certain period of time, they would charge it as 12 individual slices. Yikes, that's one expensive cake!

The shop itself is pretty small with very limited seating. Probably better to just buy it and go. Your eating experience will depend entirely on who else is in the shop and if you're unlucky enough to sit next to some really loud people (which unfortunately, we were), it might ruin your experience. 

I'm a big fan of crepe cakes with their delicate texture and subtle sweetness. I'm hoping this trend really explodes and more flavours are offered in the future. Lady M in NYC has around 10 delicious flavours of crepe cake. You can do it, Millie, I believe in you!

{"text":"Worth breaking your Bikini Body 2015 goals for: 
The unique flavours of gelato,
- Pandan ($3.50 single scoop), a type of leaf popular in Southeast Asian cooking. But also- since pandan is a leaf...that would mean it's a vegetable, and since vegetables are healthy, that means a pandan gelato would also be healthy...right...right?! The flavour can be best described as green tea meets coconut, creamy with a hint a bitterness. 
- Khao San Road Thai Iced Tea

Worth breaking Mission Bikini Body 2015 if you moved in some way today: 
- Green tea crepe ($7.50): impressively holding 20 layers of crepes in one slice, the cake was still surprisingly light. The green tea cream in between the crepes was commendable, not too creamy or sweet that it overwhelmed the light and fluffy crepes 

Would forego altogether:
- Banana chocolate crepe ($4.95): something I feel like the elderly would really enjoy. The the combination of whipped cream and banana and crepe and nutella just made the whole experience super soft and slightly mushy and pretty sure you don't even need teeth to eat this. I would personally add gelato or the cornflakes they have in the store to change up the texture a bit."}
{"text":"Delicious Japanese ice cream crepes

Millie's fills a void that was missing, at least in Toronto.  Featuring both savoury and sweet crepes, it looks as though you can come here for a meal or dessert (or both).

Seating is a bit limited and it's a fairly small shop.  It's a stone's throw away from Spadina on the left side."}
{"text":"Great little location right beside the Baldwin parking lot. The staff was friendly, there's a few tables for dine in. The Japanese style green tea gelato crepe was ok (nothing special) but the layered crepe cake was delicious! Creamy and smooth.

No debit, cash or credit card only (tips auto added)

Will try the savory creeps next time! But the cake is a must try!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick dessert! When I say \"QUICK', it is because it's not a sit down place for you and your friends to chill and lounge around while enjoying dessert. It is more of an order and leave type of set up. 
Last few times I've been here was on a nice summer evening/ afternoon where we can eat outside where they placed a tiny little table and some chairs. 

It doesn't matter how we ate it --- it is just an enjoyable delight! The crepe is so soft and 'eggy' flavour I love it! doesn't taste bland and flour-y like most crepes. This is the REAL EGGY flavor crepe. 
We ordered the icecream with fruits wrapped in the crepe and it was such a delicious treat after eating 2 tacos at Seven lives -- just down the street!

Perfect!"}
{"text":"I read a lot of great reviews on Yelp about Millie Creperie so I went in with high expectations. After a nice lunch at Fresco's, I decided to walk over here to have something sweet. It was a Saturday afternoon and quite busy so a lot of people must have had a similar idea. 

The shop itself is tiny; there are some places to sit, but not a lot. We ordered the banana Nutella crepe. It was decently priced at about $7. As others have mentioned, it's hard to eat; there are not a lot of places to sit so you order your crepe and walk while eating. The first few bites were only whipping cream and pieces of banana. I found the crepe to be a-ok; not amazing, but not terrible at the same time.

Good for: crepes, dessert"}
{"text":"Yay Millie!! Finally came here after seeing a ton of beautiful crepe cake photos posted all over my social media feed.

Millie Creperie is a small little shop located in Kensington Market. Walking in, there are four small tables on the left with 2 seats each, though there are chairs at the side if more people come in. I do not recommend coming in here with a group of people, unless you guys come in a time when people are busy (e.g. at work, etc). The menu was easy to read with a few photos showing how each of them look like. 

Of course, we decided to try the green tea crepe cake - a famous item on their list. The crepe cake was very small. I'd say approximately 7cm for the largest section and maybe 15cm in length for $8.50. Each crepe layer was extremely thin enriched with a thin layer of cream in between each of the layers - it was oh so delicious. Soft and delicate with approximately 20 layers, the cake squishes together as you cut into to. It was definitely expensive, but because of the amount of work they put into it, I think it was worth it.

Another item we tried was the Japanese special crepe. The crepe was wrapped very nicely stuffed with chocolate (that I couldn't really taste) and strawberries all in the inside and topped with green tea ice cream and whipping cream all wrapped up in a roll. The mixture of flavours together was DELICIOUS. I don't know how it would taste if i ate it as a wrap though (I unfolded everything when I ate it), because if I ate it as a wrap, I would have to eat the entire ice cream and whipped cream before I get to the strawberry galore."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying the savoury crepes. It was recommended by a friend. I have to say this was very, very good!!  The crepes are so light and fluffy. I am definitely coming back to try out other ones on their menu."}
{"text":"Stop 3 of a food tour through Kensington Market and this was the perfect way to cap it off.

They had a whole assortment of sweet or savoury crepes along with a selection of parfaits and gelato.

We ended up deciding on the green tea Millie Crepe Cake and it was a complete joy!  It is light and fluffy but has the dense chewiness of regular cheesecake.

Although they only use 20 crepes to create the crepe cake, it looked like it had many more layers than that!

Looking forward to be able to drop in to try the menu again. :-)"}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for a really long time. Finally made it. Mind you, it's a really small shop with just two tables to sit at.

I got the green tea layered crepes cake. One slice is like $8! So savour it slowly.

I took it to go, so by the time I ate it a few hours later, the cream was soft and melty. 

I was surprised though, the slice is really small. I guess you're paying for the labour involved, but the taste was okay. Sweet, and it taste exactly like whipped cream. There's like 20-25 layers but you taste more cream than crepe.

Okay to experience it, but I wouldn't buy another. It's like buying one of those uncle tetsu cakes; cool to try once as a one time thing since it's expensive."}
{"text":"Small place in an eclectic (not posh) neighborhood, not meant for lounging for long, only a few seats inside and a few extra outside when nice out. But who cares: I was here for the mille crepes cake. Had a tough decision between original (vanilla) or green tea. Saw only 2 pieces left of vanilla so that's where I went: delicious, sweet cream, no stabilizers, pleasant vanilla brightness. Tender crepe structure, loose construction so clearly freshly made. Worth the splurge in calories and dollars (these are such a pain to make, I'm perfectly ok with price $6.50, which I think is reasonable)."}
{"text":"Busy? Not at all. Perhaps it's because it was colder than -20 when we went. Bitterly cold. This was our last stop in Kensington before heading uptown for dinner. After 5 hours of wandering around Kensington eating everything in sight, this was a sweet way to end things off. There were four of us and we shared the Japanese special. In hindsight, this wasn't the best idea. I'm used to getting crepes on plates. The picture displayed the kind you hold, but I didn't put two and two together. Oops. 

For the price, it's a fairly good crepe. Not super sweet. Very Instagram friendly. The matcha gelato was good on matcha flavor. 

One interesting thing here. All their tables are made for two people, and all the chair backings look like clear plastic spoons. Given the kind of food they serve, I thought it'd be nicer inside."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of about this place, and I'm glad to have finally experienced millie creperie for myself! Upon entering, it strongly reminded me of princess crepe in Paris- except for the pink lolita decor, Millie crepe has that nice hip, interior that gives you an air of being in a local cafe in Toronto. The staff there were super friendly and cheery.

I had the mango parfait. The mango sorbet was delicious but I expected yogurt with the parfait instead of cream. It was a little difficult to scoop up all the ingredients at once since the parfait was densely packed into the cup.

The green tea cake was fantastic though, and I would definitely try out their other cake flavours as well as their crepes next time.

I definitely enjoyed my experience here and I hope to come back again!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, cute cozy place and delicious crepes! So fluffy and light. I ordered the original crepe cake and it was heavenly"}
{"text":"Ordered the mango parfait and japanese special. We read reviews here that set the standard pretty high, however our crepe was limp and they didn't have any more green tea gelato so we settled for hazelnut. The gelato was good by itself but the crepe was a soggy mess. The parfait was more enjoyable with the corn flakes adding that extra crunch. Overall it was a decent experience and fun to have once in a while when down at Kensington. However I will not be returning because frankly it was not worth it for the price and what we got!"}
{"text":"The Millie Creperie is apparently the first place to serve Japanese crepe cakes and parfaits in Toronto (finally!). I can attest to this, as I noticed that the staff there actually spoke Japanese. The store is located in Kensington Market. The space is tiny, can seat maximum around 15 people, so takeouts are recommended. I came here around opening time on a Saturday afternoon, and the place was already packed! They serve both sweet and savoury crepes, parfaits, as well as the infamous Millie crepe cake. 

I ordered the Tori crunch crepe. The fresh-off-the-grill crepe forms a triangular cone, which is filled with chicken, cucumber, corn flakes (gives it the crunch), cheese, and a spicy mayo. One bite into it, and I immediately fall in love with the spicy, savoury, and crunchy combination! 

The sweet crepes are also delicious as well. I tried some of my friend's Japanese special crepe, which is filled with strawberry pieces, red bean paste, matcha, whipped cream, and topped off with a scoop of green tea ice cream. It's a great snack on a hot summer day! We also couldn't resist getting a slice of their famous green tea Millie Crepe cake to go.

Overall, I'm very glad that I finally found a place in Toronto that has crepe cakes! If you love crepes as much as I do, then you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"When I'm in Kensington (actually, even though I'm not) I venture to Millie to get desserts. I usually get the mango or green tea parfait. This place has a crowd on a Friday night when we went. They have hot food too and savoury crepes that I want to try but I always default to desserts.

This time, I saw they have the layered matcha cake and black sesame ice cream so i got those. BLACK SESAME. Not one of your regular flavour so it was worth a try. Sesame-y and creamy ice cream. Matcha is good but the cream melted when it was sitting there for a while. It got messy on the plate. They are both good."}
{"text":"Cute little shop to get a slice of Japanese crepe cake, or other items such as a parfait. 

I tried the matcha crepe cake and it was delicious! The thin layers of crepe filled with rich matcha was a refreshing dessert. I wanted a second slice, and it was not too cloying or sweet! 

Great spot for people watching too, as lots of people pass through the Kensington Market on this street."}
{"text":"Is it good? YES Would I come back? NO

I got a small slice of earl grey crepe cake to go for ~$8. The flavour of earl grey really shined through in both the creme filling and the crepe but I simply cannot justify spending $8 on small slice of cake especially when the ingredients going into the crepe batter and the creme filling are day to day simple ingredients. 

Yes you can argue that the art of making crepes and stacking them takes time and effort hence the price, but then it can't be harder than a mouse dome cake from say butter avenue or nadege...

Im glad to have tried it once but its way too expensive for a re-visit"}
{"text":"First time going here and it's SOOO good and cheap !!!! It's Really worth every bite and this is a good place for all the people who loves green tea and crepes !!  i actually want to try all of their menu  defiantly coming back"}
{"text":"Best crepe cake I've had. 
Other places and homemade versions always had crepes that were a bit too thick, too chewy, or too eggy.
But this one was paper thin with focus on the cream (I had earl grey mmmm). You can really cut though the cake with ease, and trying to take off each layer is pretty big feat.
My only complaint is the price, and seating could definitely be improved."}
{"text":"Love the cheesecake and ice cream. This small cafe is usually busy, but really sweet and cozy. It could be better if there are more seats available. Try it and you will love it."}
{"text":"delicious millie crepes! good price and portion! absolutely recommended!"}
{"text":"Kind of a depressing atmosphere. Girls behind the counter were less than enthusiastic to answer questions about the new charcoal crepe cake. They were more interested in going back to whatever they were doing on their laptops. Nevertheless, they allowed our party of 5 to stay and enjoy the deaserts. 

Tried matcha parfait, matcha crepe cake, and earl grey crepe cake slice. All three items met expectations, especially given the price, but were not as amazing as they were hyped up to be. By the third bite, the wow factor has disappeared. Trying Millie Creperie once is probably enough."}
{"text":"As a matcha fanatic, had to give this place a try. This little \"hidden\" gem is located conveniently yet easy to miss since it is not a big place. Speaking of the size of the place, it is quite small, only three small tables, so be prepared to do take-out. 

Ordered a matcha crepe cake and a  crepe with matcha ice cream, red bean paste, strawberries, whipped cream and their matcha sauce. Both of them were good! We were definitely able to taste matcha in both of them. 

Overall, good food and service. Price is also reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Although a tiny little hole in the wall, the crepe cake is amazing ! layers and layers of light and creamy heaven."}
{"text":"Such a cute place to stop by for dessert. The bf and I wanted to get something sweet so we grabbed the green tea parfait to go and I actually liked it (I'm pretty particular when it comes to sweets--it has to be not too sweet but sweet enough). The green tea gelato and azuki strawberries were bomb. When I'm back in Toronto, I'll try to come back to try something else on their menu. Maybe the prices are a little high, but it's worth a sugar fix right?"}
{"text":"Small place but their food is definitely worth a try - the crepe cake is expensive but I've tried making it myself and I can appreciate why it costs that much."}
{"text":"The crepes here are to die for! It's a crepe wrapped with Nutella, fruit and gelato. They customized mine just how I wanted it and there staff was super friendly."}
{"text":"I love Millie Creperie. What else can I say about it? The owners are kind and gregarious, the food is lovingly prepared while you watch, and Harajuku style crepes are so much easier to cart around than French style ones! The Rabbit Food crepe is my go-to, because I love me some spicy mayo. I have a hard time staying away!"}
{"text":"I will just quickly say that I agree with all the previous reviewers. The Japanese Special Crepe and Green Tea Crepe Cake were DA BOMB! Both were super light and fluffy, sweet but not too sweet and just perfection. I could have eaten 20. Now I'm dying to try some of their other gelato flavours, particularly the Kao San Road Thai Tea.

The only down side is that the store is pretty tiny. I dropped by on a Sunday afternoon and unfortunately, there were two groups already there occupying all the chairs and tables. Does not detract from the yummy flavours though. Definitely give it a try if you're in the neighborhood! Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"Almost missed this place since the signage is not as visible as you may think. The place is quite small with only 4 small tables. 
The staff is nice and the service is pretty fast for a busy Saturday afternoon. When you walk in you smell CREPE instantly. They have many savory crepes that I wanted to try. They have a few sweet crepes and most people seem to get the first one on the board- the matcha green tea one. It looked quite good but my fiancée and I came here for just one thing the crepe cake! After trying the Lady M crepe cake in NYC, we were really excited to try the one here. We ordered an original and matcha green tea. They also had the tiramisu flavour for valentines day but it was already sold out. One slice is quite pricey but I wasn't surprised as Lady M was just as expensive.
We got the 2 slices to go since we had to wait for seats. Once we got our order, we got a table. So glad we did since it was too cold to eat outside lol. 
I took my first bite of the original and it was quite light and creamy at first. The more I had it the more the cake was falling apart and it got heavier and heavier. I remember the one I had at the other place was so much more light and yummy- so I was a little disappointed. Same goes with the matcha slice and there wasn't a strong green tea flavour as we had imaged.

Next time we will their crepes and parfaits...and I would recommend coming in during a warmer season."}
{"text":"I've tried both plain and green tea (macha)
I prefer plain! price is little bit expensive but I recommend try.

Not enough seats left to be desired."}
{"text":"Crepes are still amazing but prices have definitely gone up, probably along with each item's popularity. Had the rabbit food + chicken crepe for $6.9 and while the picture makes the crepe look small, don't be fooled by that. It's enough for a lunch and they pile on the spinach and chicken inside, so it can suffice as a lunch. 

For their crepe cakes, there's now a champagne flavour, green tea, chocolate and the original, although they don't always have all 4 of those in-store when you visit, so be ready for a surprise. Definitely looking forward to trying their gelato sometime, since there are some pretty interesting flavours, such as pandan. The shop itself is very small with only 4 tables and 8 seats or so, but they do a great job of actually cleaning up the tables and there are chairs outside the shop to enjoy your crepes."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!! Best greentea millie crepe cakes, love their japanese special crepe and their gelato as well. The only problem I have with them is that I wish the store was closer to home!!"}
{"text":"The crepe was excellent.  It was thin and tasty.  We also got the affrogato in which the espresso was very good."}
{"text":"Really nice japanese crepes.  We dont try the salt options but the sweet options is very good.  The place is very little and dont have a fancy sign but its a good place."}
{"text":"I tried their green tea parfait, not quite satisfying. I thought it would be larger than that. I think it's not really worth the price, because the greentea ice cream is the only thing that is good, the rest of them is standard. i will try their mille crepes and ice cream only when i go there next time."}
{"text":"Mango Tango is awesome! Very rich ice cream and beautifully wrapped."}
{"text":"Really happy to see a Japanese crepe shop pop up in Toronto, I've always preferred Japanese-style crepe over the traditional French or American crepes. Like most Japanese foods, the flavours are on the lighter end, and is not going to be stuffed with large amounts of jam or Nutella. If you're a big fan of traditional crepes though, it's possible this place might not satisfy your cravings as the flavours may be slightly too bland for you.

The price of this place is pretty fair for the amount of different ingredients they stuff into the crepe ($8). I love how much value is put into the aesthetics of a Japanese crepe, it looks like a flower when you get it - a sweet, delicious, flower. It's also meant to be held and eaten like an ice cream cone, which is convenient if you want to stroll around the market while munching on your crepe.

On my recent visit here, I purchased a slice of the crepe cake. While the cake is somewhat expensive ($8 per slice), a lot of work does go into making a crepe cake so I'm sure you're paying for the labour. The cost does add up though if you want to order a whole crepe cake - if you order a few days in advance they can make the cake for you for about $70, but if you want one on the day of it's charged as 12 slices of a single slice - which would make it a pretty damn expensive cake. I think that with a bunch of other places offering crepe cakes, it's possible that the prices of crepe cakes will drop. But for now, as long as the demand is there, prepare to pay a premium for the entire cake.

My main concern with this place is the layout. It is quite a tiny place but they still try to accommodate some seating, which is nice but often makes the cafe feel crammed when it's too chilly outside for outdoor seating. I think it may be worthwhile to convert to standing tables and counters at least during the winter to accommodate more people."}
{"text":"I had a piece of matcha crepe cake.. it is just a typical crepe cake. Nothing special for me. Might not have it again for that price.."}
{"text":"Honestly. So good. If you're in the Chinatown/Kensington Market area, you must stop here for a sweet treat. The Japanese special crepe had just enough sweetness and was just all around good. I've never seen Thai iced tea gelato before, next time I visit I'm definitely getting some! And also trying their crepe cake!"}
{"text":"After months of hearing all the hype I've finally done it. I caved in for desserts. It's more difficult than you think. =P

Does this place warrant all that hype?? It's a resounding YES but not without caveats. The crepe here is a work of art, delicate in style and tasteful in flavour -- a true show of Japanese craftsmanship. In this case, I think the visuals outweigh the humble taste buds a bit.

The crepes are delicately thin yet somehow resisted breaking from the overbearing load of the ice cream. Everything here like all Japanese stuff is about balance. Lightly flavoured ice cream(in this case macha), a little of freshness from the fruits, all sparingly(beautifully) dressed with a bit of sauce. Every bite is light and airy with just a hint of sweetness.

The caveats I would say are just my personal agendas. Firstly, I find the flavours a little too bland; there's not much brightness, no pop! Secondly, it lacked textural variety. Everything seemed like it was soft on soft and there's no crispiness or crunchiness to make it a little interesting."}
{"text":"A very cute and lovely place. I came here last summer and will probably go again. 

I think I had the banana crepe, and it was rolled into a cute cone and loaded with whipped cream! It was the presentation that really got to me - I'm a sucker for designed food. However the cone does get messy while eating, but that's the fun part. 

Overall, it's a cute little place for desserts."}
{"text":"This place is really good for a quick, easy and pleasent dessert! My mom and I decided to stop by today after reading the yelp reviews! I was especially excited since they had a Japanese special crepe w/ green tea icecream.. redbean and whip cream! The crepe was really full of fresh ingredients and flavorful! My mom's mango tango crepe was just as good!"}
{"text":"I walked in on a freezing winter afternoon but picked up Japanese Special Crepe with mocha cone on the top! I was waiting for my friend to join me without order at first 15mins but the owners were so kind to give me a hot water while we chatted a bit regarding Japanese cuisine as I used to travel to Japan in 2012.
At the end, I got a card enables a free crepe once you buy 10 as a gift!
Definitely another canteen of myself in the future as I live just 20 mins from it!"}
{"text":"This is the second millie crepe that I have had in Toronto. This one really did not disappoint. I got the original mille crepe. The crepe was fresh, light and fluffy. The cream was light, but sweet. I could taste each layer. Definitely liked this mille crepe more than the other one I tried. 

Seating is limited. There are a couple of seats outside.

The store does not have an unlimited supply of crepes so once it's sold out, it's sold out for the day. Even their Japanese special crepe ice cream was sold out when we were there on a Sat afternoon around 3:00pm."}
{"text":"The mango tango crepe is my favorite.

The service is very friendly and it's a nice little place.

The price is a bit high."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their gelato is amazing! My favourite one is Thai iced tea. Their matcha cake is also very good, fluffy, rich in taste and just the right amount of sweetness! Also great service!"}
{"text":"I love the crepe cake at Millie Creperie. The crepe cake is rich and creamy, and the soft crepes create a unique texture to the cake as a whole.

So far I've tried the green tea and original vanilla flavours, and they were both delicious. I would recommend the green tea one, although I will for sure be back in the future to try their other flavours! 
This small shop in Kensington market has limited seating area, but you can also get your cake to-go."}
{"text":"10/10 for this visit.

Had the savoury wafu chicken and a mille crepe cake (20 layers of crepes with delicious vanilia cream).

So so good.

Staff are really cute too."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm tori crunch, okonomiyaki crepes and mille crepe cake!!!! Nom nom nom nom nom nom nom nom!!!!!! Best crepes evaaaaahhhhhhh!!"}
{"text":"Delicious desserts! I've been craving green tea ice cream ever since I visited Japan so decided to go here vs Tsujiri. I had the green tea parfait and it was just as good as it looks! I was a huge fan of the red bean topping. For the price (~$7 total), the parfait was for me worth it."}
{"text":"Such a cute store with the sweetest staff ever! Was greeted right away and decided to get the mille crepe cake (in green tea!) after hearing so much about it. Sooo delicious! Definitely coming back again!

They also have crepes, parfaits, gelato, and savoury food items."}
{"text":"Crepes are super thin! (good, though I personally prefer a slightly thicker French style crepe for more bite.. )

Okonomiyaki Crepe - disappointed that it was just all cabbage and sauce... my own fault. I thought it had some chicken or shrimp in it.. 

Kakuni Crunch - this was much better & my fav out of the three. the pork belly was tender, paired well with the cool cucumber, the crispy corn flakes and the kick from the sauce to tie it together. 

Japanese Special - green tea gelato, strawberries, and whipped cream. Quite good as well, not too strong on the flavors."}
{"text":"Yumz loved it! Got the crepe cake & parfait.  So good couldn't stop until i was finished and too full.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"The star item on the menu is the green tea crepe cake! It has many layers of super thin crepes, lined with creme, and topped with lots of matcha powder. It's not overly sweet and has a little bit of crispness on the side. Highly recommended!
The restaurant is very small with just several tables. There are ice cream and crepes on the menu as well."}
{"text":"Delicious! I had the original crepe cake that was both beautiful and so delicately delicious. My son had the matcha gelato crepe and he said it was one of the best desserts he's ever eaten. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I tried Tiramisu and Green Tea crepe cakes. They are awesome :)

-1 star for \"Japanese\" portion sizes. They are tiny, especially for a cake that costs $8.75. I wish they gave you a bigger slice :(

Update: Earl Gray and Sakura cakes are nothing special, imho. In fact, the Sakura crepe cake had very little taste to it, mostly just cream."}
{"text":"Overpriced. well I expected too much so the taste was what I assumed as usual Japanese desserts.  And it was little bit hard to eat due to the layers."}
{"text":"I thought the green tea was bit overrated. The taste was bland but it's perfect for someone who doesn't like too much sugar. The price is greater than the quantity and the quality of the food. Would not come back again but it was a nice experience. Totally recommend everyone to try it once."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday evening to finish off a night of eating around Kensington. We wanted some dessert and this was conveniently located near Spadina. The shop is a little small but has a few tables inside. Ordered a Japanese Special Crepe.

It was packed with whipped cream, Matcha gelato, strawberries and read bean paste (azuki). The crepe was light and a little chewy. The flavours went really well together, and I enjoyed their crepes. The only problem was I wasn't sure how to eat it after a while. We ended up unwrapping all of it and just chewing off bits, but it was still good. I definitely want to return to try some of the other gelato flavours."}
{"text":"An excellent dessert option, especially since it's open until later in the evening and is in a convenient location near Kensington Market. We headed over for an after-dinner dessert run since dinner was a little on the light side (looking at you Peoples Eatery). Extra star for being there for our hungry stomachs.

They make your crepes fresh to order, so be prepared to wait but the end result is worth it! I had the Japanese Special Sweet Crepe, and it was a substantial dessert. The crepe is on the soft side and not too sweet, so it is really just a vehicle for the different fillings. They are generous with their green tea icecream and there is even red bean on the bottom. 

A downside is that their space is small, so in the colder months there are only a handful of seats to eat your dessert in.  Visit in the summer months and you can wander around Kensington as you enjoy your treat."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! This is a tiny place only three tables and not much space to place chairs around those three tables. 

This place is known for their crepe cake so I had to order the original and they were also serving the green tea crepe cake and that's what the boyfriend ordered and my friend ordered their ice cream in a crepe with whip cream and strawberries.

Both crepe cakes were very delicious! Light and airy texture, not too sweet at all! It's a little pricey for a slice but worth every bite. I highly recommend their original crepe cake if it's your first time here! The dessert my friend got was great but nothing I haven't tried before. 

They also serve savory crepes which are great place to grab for brunch or lunch. I would like to try their khao San road thai iced tea gelato next time since they were sold out when I went. 

Great place, can't wait till I visit next time. I still dream about the crepe cake....sigh..."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: crepes are some of my favourite things in the entire world and I consider myself quite a connoisseur. So it's no surprise that I fell in love with this little creperie in Kensington Market. I had never before experienced the bliss that is a crepe cake, and I realized at Millie Creperie that I had missed out on twenty year's worth of potential delight from this delicacy. So now I need to make up for lost time!

I ordered both a slice of Millie's original crepe cake and a banana split crepe, and both were absolutely divine. But also very messy! The crepe was wrapped up like an ice cream cone, which I decided to eat on my way from the restaurant to my car. Bad idea; ice cream dripped all over my hands and my napkins were in my closed purse, meaning I could not access those napkins without drenching my purse in ice cream. Lesson learned. If you're going to eat a crepe on the go, bring LOTS of napkins. :) But that crepe was well worth it.

And the cake...well, I've already said a lot about that. It was perfectly creamy and fluffy and just melt in your mouth goodness. I gobbled it up in about a minute flat and am planning to return soon for more. I'm also looking forward to trying some of their savoury crepes. 

Millie Creperie also has a reward program where you can get a card and they will stamp it each time you buy something; after you have ten stamps, you get a free crepe."}
{"text":"The green tea parfait was basically alright. It had whip cream, corn flakes, two scoops of green tea; all layered in a parfait cup. The crepes were probably a better choice but my date wanted the parfait. I was a bit disappointed at how it was put together. Seemed like a mash up of ingredients that really didnt meld together. 

I will come back and try the crepe and update this review when I do."}
{"text":"Love this place!! It's so amazing! People are friendly and crepes are delicious! Get the banana split crepe. They can customise it for you too if you don't like something in the crepe. Definitely recommend the vanilla gelato though."}
{"text":"How am I not surprised that the Japanese take such pride in making everything so beautifully presented and take such good care in everything they do?

First of all, their staff is super polite. It's a really small shop and only 2 people were working. One manning cash and the other making crepes. They have a pretty decent selection, I got the banana sundae one. It takes some time for it to be ready since it's made fresh plus they make sure everything is laid out nicely in their crepe.  Crepe was crispy on the outside but soft to chew. I really enjoyed it and would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"We visited on a Friday evening and had the Green Tea Parfait. To be honest, it was just alright and wasn't anything too spectacular. After we ate it, we kind of wished we had ordered a crepe instead. 

The Green Tea Parfait is a decent size, with two scoops of Green Tea ice cream, a bit of whipped cream, a couple scoops of Corn Flakes, two pieces of strawberries, two Pocky sticks, and a couple of other toppings. Yes, it looked great and props for presentation, but overall, it felt like everything was just thrown together in a cup without any real cohesiveness. 

Also, the ice cream was a little too bitter for us and overpowered any sweetness that could potentially balance it out. It was a light, satisfactory snack, but nothing that totally blew us away. Next time, we'll definitely go for the crepes instead! Or a slice of cake.

For our Green Tea Parfait, I paid a total of $7.01."}
{"text":"Nice little place to drop by for dessert. The parfaits are nice and well crafted. The highlight really though is the crepe cakes - definitely a must try if you've never had it before, it's quite unique. Unfortunately, the selection here of flavours is more limited than what you can get at their other location."}
{"text":"nice and light tasting cakes! Tried an original and matcha green tea slices.

similar to Lady M cakes! 

Will be back to check on the ice cream!"}
{"text":"A friend and I checked this place out after grabbing dinner around the corner the other day. 
The interior is quite small with a few tables and there are some stools outside you can sit on.

I ordered the Banana Split and my friend ordered the Japanese Special. 
The main filling within the crepes is the creamy/amazingly tasty gelato, vanilla and green tea flavour respectively.

You also get whipped cream which tastes unlike any I've tried before and some nice strawberries that further add to it.
On the Japanese Special, there is azuki (red bean paste) and if you're a red bean fan, then you'll dig this.

As others have mentioned, it does get a bit weird to eat once you've made your way to the bottom but I can't wait to come back and try the rest of their flavours.

P.S. They also do savoury if sweet isn't really your thing."}
{"text":"Like many others have said, the place itself is very small and difficult to find a seat to enjoy your meal. This place offers crepes with ice cream and fruits inside as well as the Millie crepe cake. Having had both, I would definitely recommend the cake more than the other desserts. Despite the fact that it costs nearly 8 bucks for a small slice of cake. 

Given that this was my only Millie crepe experience, I don't have much to compare it to. I tried both the original and the green tea crepe cakes and thought they were both delicious. I like how it wasn't super sweet. It was kind of difficult to eat because the cake was so 'slimy' in a sense that the crepes stacked on top of one another kept falling off. 

I would definitely give this place a try, in particular their cakes. I also tried the Japanese crepe with the green tea ice cream, whip cream and strawberries, which was very ordinary - although it does look very appetizing."}
{"text":"Tiny little joint that specializes in crepes. The crepe is wrapped and shaped like a giant cone and filled with ice cream, whipped cream, sliced strawberries and chocolate drizzle. Its a good combination of flavours. I found it very difficult to eat and very messy. Tasted okay to me but nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"The perfect place to have a treat, especially on a hot day!
I got the Japanese special crepe that had matcha ice cream, whipped cream, strawberries, and sweet red bean paste. 

Their matcha gelato is extremely creamy and soft! (Unlike a lot of store bought green tea ice cream, it's not overly sweet). Their whipped cream is delicious and the red bean paste perfectly compliments the crepes. 

It's a bit expensive...costing between 6-8 dollars but it's def worth it if you want to splurge a bit and treat yo self."}
{"text":"OMG this review is 2 years late. I know.. super lame of me. But I still want to vouch for this place because it was the first time I had layered crepe cake and I tried both the vanilla and the green tea one and I loved it!!! The cafe itself was super small, tiny little gem i n Kensington that I probably would have walked right past had my friend not recommend it to me. I'm really glad I got to try the crepe cakes here because they're super tasty, and the crepes aren't dried out at the edges. Since the time I visited Millie's, I've had crepe cakes at other place in the GTA and they're just not as good. Often the edges of the crepes would be dried out or burnt which is disappointing but Millie does not disappoint. Only thing is, because the space is small, just don't come in big groups or except to find a seat at all on the weekends. You can easily take the dessert to go though!"}
{"text":"I love MIllie Creperie! Cleary I am not alone in this sentiment, either. It's kind of in an obscure location, tucked inside of an alley, but the treasure hunt for this store is totally worth it. It's small but there are enough tables to settle down in. I usually get take-out because I like to eat in the comfort of my own home, but a lot of people just mill about inside / outside on the tables too.

The mille crêpe cakes are divine. So fluffy and soft. I like how when you sink your fork in the layers squish together and merge into a gorgeous mess. They run out of new cake flavours pretty quickly- I wanted to order the champagne one but by 8 pm it was gone. I also like their original crêpes; they're topped off with delicious ice cream!

The chefs are so lovely, and they gave us a really cute Millie Creperie take-out bag. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Love their crepes and gelato! So flavourful and the crepes have the perfect texture. Only downside is limited seating especially since they're always busy!"}
{"text":"Definely one of the best crepes out there. We found this place on Yelp while we visited Toronto. It was located in a convenient location (In Kensington Market by Toronto's Chinatown). The store itself is not very big, There was around 3 or 4 tables. The staffs there was very friendly and polite.

We order the Nutella Banana and Mango Tango. The Nutella Banana was definitely  my favorite. The crepe was very thin and the Nutella blended in with the crepe ^^ I could a million of them. The Mango Tango is good too but the Mango ice cream was a bit sour for me. I would definitely come back the next time I come back to Toronto."}
{"text":"A nice small dessert shoppe in Kensington. Not too much seating so come in small groups. The two servers were very patient as we debated over what to order--everything sounded good. Decided on the Japanese Special Crepe and it was made fresh to order. We INHALED it haha. Quickly became of my favourite places in Kensington!"}
{"text":"My friend recommended me this place because she loves their mille crepe cake, which is what I ordered. It was my first time eating a mille crepe cake. The multiple crepe layers combined with the sweet cream was really good. There were also gelato and other Japanese style crepe desserts that I didn't get to try. The store is very small though, only like three small tables."}
{"text":"I love crepes and these crepes beat demitires out of the park we had the crepe with green tea ice cream and other toppings absolutely delicious. They know their stuff if it wasn't so far I will probably come here everyday and gain weight. The staff was very friendly very small space since it's kesington market. The vibe there is different I think a lot of people in ke sign-on smoke pot."}
{"text":"When arriving to the shop, it was around night time. The store was so dim and had like one ceiling light opened. Personally, it looked really sketch from the outside. But because it said Millie Creperie, we decided to go inside anyway. The shop is really small with only 3-4 plastic tables and plastic chairs. It was not a comfortable setting to chill.  So if you don't come early, you won't get a seat. Since the shop is so tight, it makes it uncomfortable standing in there with lots of people. 

You can tell the store had really nice workers. The service was prompt. 

The prices are expensive for what they offer. Ordered: Green Tea Parfait, Green Tea Millie Crepe Cake, Okonomiyaki Crepe, and Wasabi Chicken Crepe. The best out of the items we ordered was definitely the famous crepe cake. The cake honestly tasted spectacular but since the slice was so small, it didn't justify their price tag (I believe it was around 7.50 to 8.50?). The Green Tea Parfait was not worth it (their green tea ice cream isn't even soft serve, which was a disappointment) and it was difficult to eat with so many things squished into one small plastic cup. But the savoury crepes was the reason that drove this rating down to a 3/5. The crepe did not match the savoury food.. it just did not taste any good. Especially for the Wasabi Chicken, the whole crepe tasted so dry... I highly DO NOT recommend it. TIP: Stick to the desserts. 

But the question is would I ever come here again? Probably not. I don't think its worth squishing yourself into a small shop to get an overpriced cake/parfait/crepe. I think there are way better dessert places in downtown Toronto that have more comfortable seating."}
{"text":"Cute little crepe place tucked inside a side street between chinatown and Kensington market....tiny place, only like 3 tiny ikea tables with 2 chairs eat

Authentic japanese place that serves ice cream, crepes and their signature crepe cake who is composed of approximately 20 layers of crepe...we tried the green tea cake and first bite is like eating a ice cream...sooooo goooddddd, price was $8.50 for a slice of cake, kind of pricy but good
Will try their crepes next time"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and it is just an amazing place hidden away. It's not very expensive compared to other places and the stuff here is delicious and the staff are friendly. I've tried the mango tango crepe, banana split, and the crepe cake and they're all very tasty. No complaints."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem - with a little emphasis on the 'hidden.' It's located on one of the side streets that connects Spadina to Kensington Market. We're talking a lot of dust, perpetual scaffolding, and some pretty aggressive panhandlers. The interior of Millie's is minimalist and clean, a pretty sharp contrast. 

The crepes here are crazzy good - forget the soggy, floppy, wan looking things you get elsewhere. These are positively crispy, almost to the point of crunch. They come rolled up like a massive ice cream cone, stuffed with delicious goodies of your choosing. 

They've got the usual, necessary toppings - strawberries, nutella, bananas, gelato. But props to them for having lychee, crushed azuki, mango, and other hard to find toppings. You can make your own crepe, or you can go for one of their premade varieties - the Japanese special is pretty awesome. A huge crepe, drizzled with nutella, rolled into a cone shape. There's a scoop of green tea ice cream surrounded by a halo of strawberries, and the bottom point of the coin is filled with crushed azuki. This is all topped with their delicious, fresh made whipped cream.

They serve savory crepes too - definitely looking forward to getting a cheese crepe.

The thing I love the most is that it's not too sickeningly sweet like other crepe places. The flavors are very mild and delicate so I don't end up feeling like swearing off sugar for a few weeks afterwards.

The owners are very nice, and are very receptive to suggestions for the menu; it seems like they're constantly experimenting with new combinations. I happened to drop by in time to sample a mille crepe cake they had been experimenting with - almost 100 crepes with custard sandwiched between, so that it resembled a cake.

100% worth a visit!"}
{"text":"A small little store located in Kensington this places sells many varieties of Japanese crepes - not only dessert crepes but other crepes such as Okonomayaki crepes as well. I decided to try the green tea Millie crepe which apparently has 20 layers of crepe in it. The top part of the cake is coated with a layer of green matcha powder. Each layer of crepe is very thin and delicate and is stuck together with some light cream. I liked the overall presentation of it. As well, it is nice and light, and not too sweet. The slice that I got was prepared and was cut and served directly from one of their displays, so think the cake would have tasted even better if it was made fresh and warmed up. But overall it was still pretty good. There are 3-4 small red/silver tables inside where you can sit and enjoy your crepes. Service was okay. From what I remember I believe they use flourescent tubes for lighting so its pretty bright in there like a kitchen lol I would probably come back to try out some of their non-dessert crepes"}
{"text":"Had the crepe original cake. Layers of thin crepe stuck together with cream tasted delicious, however the slice was a bit pricey. 

The texture and flavours were sweet and worth the admission though."}
{"text":"I am sorry but the Millecrepe cake in Japan taste better.  It tasted like just whip cream to me.  I could hardly taste the crepe or even get the fragrant hint of the crepe like in Japan.   I prefer the crepe part to be more dense and less whipped cream taste.  Definitely not worth the price for the presentation either compared to the more refined Lady M ones.  Not that I like LadyM either.   They both tasted like whip cream to me.   I, however, did like their pandan and Thai tea gelato.  Unique flavours that's hard to find elsewhere.   I know they are known for the savory crepes but it didn't look enticing enough for me to want to go back and try as the place looks dingy and small and the environment, a bit messy and stuffy.   If you're looking for a more refined French style crepe place that's really good - I highly recommend trying Crepes-A-Gogo."}
{"text":"I started coming here last summer to fulfill my crepe wishes. Can I just say, it was amazing. So far I have only been getting the mango ice cream crepe, but I am planning to go and try the green tea one soon. This cafe also sells parfaits and crepe cakes, which do sound quite tasty. The store itself was pretty easy to locate, but the seating space is very limited. If you're lucky, the place will be empty, but if not, then it will be stacked. Not much of a problem though. Overall, great place and will visit again."}
{"text":"Place is tiny. Friendly Staff! Depress that they did not have the Khao San Road Thai Ice Tea Gelato when I was there. It was sold out. However, I tried the mango and green tea gelato. BEST GELATO EVER!! I also tried the Green tea flavour Mille Crepes Cake. Each layer had a smooth cream with matcha in between. The matcha was a little too strong for me, but I did enjoy this crepe cake. My boyfriend is in love with it."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try Millie because ever since I had my first mille crêpe cake in NYC last summer, I was hooked. The only problem here at Millie's is that it was obvious that they hadn't made the crêpe cakes fresh. It tasted like it had been previously frozen and was simply thawed. I was so, so, so disappointed. 

I had been anticipating a good crêpe cake since we started planning for Toronto, and it was a huge flop. Along with the blow of the below average crêpe cake, they only have two flavors - original and matcha. I guess I had been spoiled with Lady M in NYC, as they have well over 2 flavors of cakes.

Alas, the ladies there were nice, but they were busy with other orders and couldn't help me right away. So, I waited a bit before I could get that highly sought after slice. Only to be disheartened at the lack of quality. I didn't try any of their other items, like a regular crêpe or ice cream, so I can't comment on those. Though I would come back to try them before ruling Millie out. 

Overall: 2/5
Food: 2/5
Service: 3/5
Atmosphere: 2/5 - Small with dirty tables."}
{"text":"Over 20 plus layers of deliciousness. I got both the green tea matcha and original crepes, and both were super yummy. Typical of Japanese desserts, they were very light. So, if you're looking for something more dense and sweet, move on. There were also tons of savoury crepes, too! 

Small space and just a few small tables, so not ideal for a large group. Price? Not cheap by any means, but who cares? It's pretty good! 

Hours: 12:30 PM - 8:30 PM
Parking: Street or Green P in Kensington Market"}
{"text":"The reviews on Yelp are sordid.

Anyone who thinks this place has \"Japanese\" crepes should just stop writing. Hey people, why don't you just keep a diary next to your beds instead?

Once upon a time some guy or guys go to japan notice the creativity of the crepes in Harajuku (or wherever), come back here, hire Japanese ESL students, add a word in kanji (that they themselves could not read or write) on their window and start selling \"Japanese\" crepes. 

Hate to break it to you: but stuffing strawberry or tea or red beans or whatever into a crepe does not make it Japanese much less make it \"authentic.\" Japanese crepes are made with 'mochi.' Never heard of it? Apparently, neither have the owners (I hope, or else they are making stuff up).
Of course, just being a shop trying to make a buck the owners have little conviction and are already drifting towards other ventures.

Aside from the very ordinary and very overpriced and expensive crepes, they have parfaits and cake. 
The other thing is I am not into whipped cream. That is why I much prefer a place like Garni where the cream puffs and other pastry is made with actual cream.

The atmosphere is depressing (and not just because a slice is $8, which makes Uncle Tetsu look like a good deal in comparison) as next to no effort has gone into making the store a pleasant experience. I was out as soon as I could not because I was sad I paid $20, but also because the store looks like an old bathroom with three small tables and six chairs. 

This store is as exciting and compelling and authentic and Japanese as all the Chinese sushi places, Korean izakayas and that North York place owned, run and staffed by Koreans selling \"authentic\" udon to masses of yelp reviewers. Sorry if this sounds harsh, but reviews are useless if they are not honest and informative and Yelp is not Bento box or BlogTo where anything and everything is super duper fantastic either out of sheer ignorance or to cater to potential advertisers."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to Millie Creperie and it did not disappoint! It's a cozy little dessert spot with limited seating so it's probably best to get take out. My friends and I tried the green tea parfait and the mango parfait. They were both good with the right amount of fresh fruits, corn flakes, gelato and even a couple of pocky sticks! My preference would definitely be the mango one though as it was really refreshing. 

The first time I went, I tried the Japanese special  which was crepe wrapped in green tea gelato, strawberry, matcha sauce and other goodness. Although it was a bit messier to eat, it was also pretty good."}
{"text":"This place was soo unique, cute, & mmm mmm good!  And it's no mystery as to why it's busy as you can smell the butter as soon as you walk in = a good sign.  ;)

(Since it was packed, I did walk out and was gonna go back later, but as soon as I saw 2 girls exit, I immediately went back in to grab a table!!!)

Millie Creperie has brought Japanese crepes to the heart of Kensington.  I ordered the 'Japanese Special' ($6.75) and it's basically a paper thin crepe, rolled into a cone shape, stuffed with some fresh fruit (I had strawberries in mine) + a scoop of gelato (matcha for me!) + some fresh whipped cream = voila, dessert crepe on the go!

They also have crepe cakes which is basically a bunch of crepes pilled on top of one another with some sort of custard cream in between the layers.  That was delicious as well.

Both items were really, really good, but do not expect syrupy fruit or sickeningly sweet Hersey's chocolate sauce-ladened crepes.  No siree!  Everything is made in-house including the gelato which was more like a \"I Can't Believe It's Not Ice Cream\" tasting.

I also ordered an Americano which was too smoky for my liking.  That was the only thing that needs improvement.  I'd probably recommend that you grab your caffeine at another café 'cause there are quite a few notable ones in the 'hood!

With prices comparable to dessert from a restaurant, why not head here instead for something homemade & different?"}
{"text":"I only had one item here which was the Matcha Crepe cake. Cake was good but it cost $8.75 per slice. I have to reconsider other places first before coming here for dessert."}
{"text":"Millie Creperie is a hidden gem tucked away in between Chinatown and Kensington Market. Getting here is a bit tricky so open up Google Maps on your phone, or it should be easily noticeable by the delicious crepe smell and line up inside the tiny store

-Japanese Crepe with Thai Ice tea ice cream - $5.95: If you are unfamiliar with Thai Ice Tea, it is the orange-colored drink that you often see in Thai restaurants. You might think it just black tea and condensed milk, but generally the tea is also infused with other spices like tamarind or star anise, and top with lots of ice. Some restaurants tend to serve it overly sweetened, masking the true flavors and make the tea become unenjoyable. Luckily the ice-cream in Millie is not too sweet and perfectly creamy with a strong tea flavor - exactly how I like my thai ice tea.

-Green tea mille crepe cake - $7.6: The green tea crepe cake was superb, soft and delicate, and not too-sweet pastry cream. Each bite melted in my mouth and the green tea flavor was very prominent. While some people might not like it, but I enjoyed the bitterness from the dusted matcha powder on top, as it cut down the creaminess of the pastry cream.

-Original Mille Crepe Cake - $6.9:  didn't enjoy the flavor of the original as it was a tad too sweet for my liking. It wasn't anything special so I would strongly recommend you to get the Green Tea or Tiramisu if they have in-store. By the way, these crepe cakes should be eaten fresh as I made a mistake to refrigerate half a slice in the fridge. The next day the cake became slightly soggy in the center, while the edges were hardened :(."}
{"text":"Wow! what a find in Kensington Market.  Amazing Japanese Creperie.  Absolutely perfect crepes - in a cone with wonderful filling combos. 

I had the Kakuni Crunch. Pork belly, spicy mayo, cucumber, cheese, corn flakes ... in an extraordinary crepe cone.  Divine crispy edges, perfectly stretchy crepe centres.  The combo of textures and flavours in the filling was amazing.  Umami was achieved.

I'm running out of superlatives and I haven't made it to the staff yet - and they deserve superlatives.

I truly can't wait to return to try the rabbit food crepe, the mille crepe cake and one of the awesome desserts with pocky.  

We are so lucky to have this gem in the city!"}
{"text":"Another popular dessert spot in North York Yonge and Finch area. They specialize in crepes, and come before dinner or they might run out of an ingredient or two.

We came a bit late - after 8pm. The place was fully packed but one party was leaving so we didn't have to wait too long. 

The waitress was kind, and got us all set up with water and napkins in no time. We ordered the parfait and a crepe. The were out of one of the ingredients that came with it so I was able to substitute it with something else.

I love how the crepes weren't too sweet, and it was a good balance between the amount of each topping. It wasn't too much of one thing.

The place itself is super crowded, not a lot of moving space, and it's close enough to hear your neighbour's business. Decor feels \"Ikea\"ish."}
{"text":"Placed an order for the earl tea crepe cake. Knowing the price of an individual slice does ease my mind knowing the cake cost is $85. Definitely not a cheap cake by any means. Came in a standard box. Staff was friendly but did seem disorganized. Day after we received the cake I was called the next day to be informed that my cake was still waiting for me to pick up. 

Cake definitely looks nice(picture doesn't do it any justice) but wasn't a fan of the guidelines. Overall taste was mellow and texture was on the airy side. First time having a crepe cake and it just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"Man, I love this place! I always take friends who are visiting Chinatown/Kensington Market here for dessert. Yeah, seating is limited, but we've always been able to squeeze in after waiting a few minutes! There's high turnover. 

My biggest dilemma is always if I should get the Nutella banana crepe or the Mango Tango with strawberry and mango gelato! I love both. This last time I went, the nice server told me that I could just mix and match flavours and add whichever gelato I want to a crepe, haha. So I ended up adding Nutella to my Mango Tango! Weird, but good. 

I haven't yet had the parfaits, or any of the savoury crepes but some of my other favourite things here are: the Khao San Road Thai iced tea gelato, and the matcha crepe cake, which is soooo good, with a million layers! I'm not even a huge fan of matcha, but this basically melts in your mouth. Pricey but worth it at least once. 

Pro tips: 
- Don't confuse this with the other location (Millie Patisserie) which is further south off Spadina, on Oxley Street. That location has the crepe cakes, but not the gelato crepes. 
- They have a loyalty card. 
- They also do takeout -- as in, they will just put your crepes in a box, in case you want to enjoy your gelato crepe somewhere else, or want to take one to go for a friend. They last at least for a 15 minute streetcar ride."}
{"text":"green tea crepe cake is so far the best crepe cake I had in GTA! it's not cheap but worth it"}
{"text":"Few years ago i won free crepe cake for their  fb guessing event and went to claim it few weeks later, their faces all looked like they wanted to spit on me so i just said nvm and went outta door."}
{"text":"Really good Japanese desserts.I've only tried the crepe cake here but it was delicious.The overall taste is less sweet than normal desserts shop,which I think is great. Both vanilla and greentea flavor are worth a try.But the place is so small that might be difficult for people to sit down and enjoy their food."}
{"text":"This is the BEST crepe in the city!!! The owner is also super friendly & will readily chat with you. We've had the savory & sweet crepes on multiple occasions -- both awesome.  
The patio is bit small - more benches, please! - but the food & service make up for it.  Nowadays we go to Kensington Market just for the crepes!"}
{"text":"We were so excited to find out there was an authentic Japanese crepe place in Toronto! The store is quite small, with limited seating available. There are stools outside for people to sit on, which is nice. We got the pork belly okonomiyaki crepe. The crepe was piping hot and freshly made. It was tasty and quite a good size for 8$. I shared it with someone, and it filled us both.

The pork belly seemed like it was boiled. I would have preferred the pork belly to have been grilled or flavoured more, as it tasted bland. All I could experience was eating fat, which is not pleasant unless it is done right. I did however enjoyed the other toppings that they added into the okonomiyaki: cabbage and bonito flakes. It was good nonetheless. I will have to come back to try their cakes. Perhaps that would change my opinion."}
{"text":"Visited Millie Creperie recently, to try out their new stardust series. I got the milkyway parfait, a scoop of black sesame and the new charcoal black forests gelato on the side. 

I'm not sure why, but all the gelato tastes really grainy that day. I know that black sesame is supposed to be a little grain due to the fact that it is made form black sesame seeds. But the charcoal Black Forest and the coconut on the parfait was really grainy too. You can taste the sugar particles inside. Really disappointed as Millie's is one of my favourite dessert spots. Hopefully they fix this as their gelatos are delicious and it's pity that the texture isn't right. 

As for flavour, the coconut was on point. The flavour tasted like real coconut. It was good but could've been better if the gelato was creamier and less icy. 

As for the new Black Forest charcoal, it literally tasted like gelato version of Black Forest cake. If you like Black Forest cake, this ones for you. P.S. it makes your mouth black after eating it. 

Lastly, the black sesame.  The black sesame flavoured gelato was also on point. With the strong and rich black sesame flavour. It tasted like the Asian black sesame pudding. A little grainy but the gelato tasted creamier than the coconut. 

Overall, all these gelato would have had a better rating if you weren't able to taste the sugar grains."}
{"text":"Great place after spending a day in Chinatown or Kensington. Came here with a small group of friends, and found very cheery and helpful staff, the food options are great from sweet and savory crepes/parfaits things are very clean and fresh. Service is a bit slow, but considering the freshness and quality control this isn't too much of an issue.

The main problem here is seating, it's very cramped and doesn't leave much in terms of atmosphere. In total there's probably enough seating for 12 people, so take your food to go and eat at the park. This place is definitely not for the claustrophobic, or those with issues regarding personal space."}
{"text":"Can't wait for their second store to open. The secret here, besides interesting ingredients, is how soft and thin the crepes are. Really, phenomenal job."}
{"text":"Totally awesome.  Very unique crepes with Japanese flavors. Millie's is a small little place on a side street off Spadina.  It took us a couple minutes to find it, but when we did we knew we were in the right place - there was someone right there in the window making the crepes!

They have a rotating menu of sweet and savory crepes with the options written up on chalkboards on the walls.  The restaurant has a handful of small tables, but the crepes are convenient for taking to go.

I ordered the Pork Belly Okonomiyaki crepe -  A crepe with miso-braised pork belly and sweet okonomi sauce, Japanese mayo, and bonito flakes.  Oh my gosh, this was AMAZING.  It's a little much to have as the same flavor for the entire meal though, so I switched off taking bites of CC's crepe to give myself a break from the flavor.  Sweet, and oh-so-good, but RICH.  

CC ordered the Wasabi Chicken crepe - grilled chicken with spinach, tomato, cucumber, wasabi mayo, and wasabi peas.  He was in love.  he agreed that mine was better for a single bite test, but he really liked the variety of textures and flavors in his.  He even attempted to make something similar when we got home the next week (with a tortilla substituted for the crepe)!

When we were both finished with our savory crepes, we agreed we had to finish with something sweet - but we were so full!  We decided to share one of the parfaits - deserts layered in a tall cup instead of wrapped in a crepe.  We shared the Green Tea Parfait - scoops of green tea gelato layered with corn flakes, strawberries, azuki (sweetened red bean paste) and matcha (ground green tea). The parfait was topped with 2 Pocky sticks. Wow.  It had a subtle sweetness, but the mix of flavors was excellent and the perfect way to end the meal. It was really best when we could manage to get a little of each of the flavors all in a single bite.  

I would definitely recommend this place as a must-try.  Awesome, unique, and a great deal."}
{"text":"My favourite crepe place in the city!!
It's Japanese style crepes, not too sweet.  I'm a huge fan of the smoked salmon and spinach one. Tasty and healthy!! Two thumbs up!!
The owners are super friendly and the food is always exceptional! Anytime I'm in the area, I always stop in to have one.
I like that the owners remember me every time I go in. They call me Blue Jay (because I'm always wearing Blue Jays gear) It's nice when the owners remember you. It shows appreciation."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars

Tried the Green tea crepe cake. It's basically a stack of 20 crepes with some light pastry filling in between and the top layer is sprinkled with matcha. 

It's REALLY good! The taste is really smooth and doesn't have too much green tea flavour. It also has great texture because of the multiple layers of crepe and almost melts in your mouth. I loved every bite of it.

We also had the Japanese special crepe which came with strawberry, green tea gelato, azuki (which is a red bean paste), Matcha sauce and whipped cream! This was also made on the spot and tasted amazing as well.

If I had to choose between the Green tea crepe cake and the Japanese special crepe. I'd have to go with the cake because it's an original and unique idea and it's very well executed. Because it has amazing texture and is absolutely delicious!

I'll definitely be back again and may consider buying an entire cake if I'm hosting a special event!

The place is also really small and they only have a couple seats, so be aware!"}
{"text":"Nice little place with a lot of potential. 
Limited selection of flavors but they make them very well. My Japanese match green tea crepe was delicious. Though it is less interesting than the one I had in Japan , but it was perfect in its own right. 
I would suggest some weird flavors and topping like cheese cake cubes, pudding/rice pudding, even do a collaboration with Kekou gelatos on Baldwin too will be very special. 

In the end it was a perfect crepe, not too heavy but hit u in the right sweet spot Hopefully next time I visit there will be some surprising flavors!"}
{"text":"Got the green tea crepe cake as a bday gift.  Truly amazing.  The layers are made very thin with cream and mocha.  Creamy yet not too overwhelming.   A must have!!"}
{"text":"We had the Khao San Road Thai iced tea ice cream and the Mango Tango crepe. The Khao San ice cream has an interesting flavour and I love it! It's creamy and really does taste like milk tea. As for the Mango Tango, the gelato and crepe were delicious. It has a nice presentation but a bit on the pricey end. Come to think of it, it's literally just a crepe wrapped with strawberry and whipped cream + gelato for a price of 6$. 

Seats are limited here - maybe just 4 tables. We came here early, so luckily we got a seat! 

Might consider coming back to try other desserts."}
{"text":"Delicious melt in your mouth dessert. A labour of loved that my taste buds throughly enjoyed. 

Like many places in Kensington seating is limited. Get in, get your Milli Crepe, enjoy it and get out ;P

Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Twenty layers of deliciousness! The crepe cakes from Millie Creperie are my favourite dessert in town. They have multiple flavours such as matcha, tiramisu, earl grey, but my personal favourite is the vanilla bean. All cakes are handmade with a layer of crepe with cream in between and the cakes are a perfect balance of sweet and fluffy! They also do sweet crepes rolled up into a cone and filled w gelato and other sweet surprises! Would definitely recommend those as well. Everything at Millie is just absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"Japanese special crepe 4/5
Crepe cake 3/5
Seating/atmosphere 2/5

The green tea gelato is definitely worth a mention - one of the best I've had in Toronto! The green tea crepe cake was very average, kind of soggy, maybe it was sitting out for too long. Although service is friendly, the seating is limited and cramped. I was seated in the corner by the garbage bin and the staff were walking in and out. It's very much a take out, grab and go dessert place but at $7-$8 for a crepe, I would have expected a better atmosphere."}
{"text":"Harajuku style crepes... On the go! 
Ordered the nutella, banana and whipped cream crepe $5 (you can sub or add on other fruits). Pretty good if you like whipped cream.

Friendly staff. Small place. Only 3 tables. So definitely to go kinda of dessert. A little costy but its fresh."}
{"text":"I had their matcha gelato. Wow, its not so sweet yet so good! I only stopped by here because I had a cake from this place in a restaurant which had three flavors of tea. It was one of the best desserts I have had so I had to check out the creperie. I was full else I would have tried their crepes. Next time I visit I probably will."}
{"text":"If Millie Creperie serves anything other than the Crepe Cake, I couldn't tell you.  This is all I see when I walk in and the rest is reverie. Ridiculously delicious,  I just....go here."}
{"text":"New items -

1. Green tea flavour Mille Crepes Cake: 20+ layers of crepes with soft and smooth cream in strong matcha flavour.

2. Khao San Road Thai Ice Tea Gelato - taste as its name; exactly like the Thai Ice Tea. Millie Creperie supplies the Thai Ice Tea Gelato to Khao San Road. If you don't wanna line up for KSR to have the gelato, you can have it at MC."}
{"text":"Known for their green tea cake, their signature item, it sure doesnt disappoint. However, it is overpriced, no doubt (at almost $8 a piece, tax not yet included). Theres 20 layers to the cake, each layer separated with green tea cream. Its sweet yet light, definitely a nice treat even all year round. You might want a coffee with that cake - the coffee balances it out. The place is pretty small so watch the hours you go in at."}
{"text":"So the reviews for this place was so good I was really hoping to instantly fall in love given that I love sweets.  I had the Millie creperie, matcha styles and BLEH!  In between the layers of the crepe was matcha cream but there was so much of it that every single bite had soggy crepe squished with so much cream that it was incredibly unpleasant.  All the other desserts look incredible but from that as a first experience I don't think I'll be back personally."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try Millie Creperie because of the hype online. I went with a friend and we both decided on the Japanese Special. 

Honest to say, I didn't think it was that special taste-wise. I felt like the point of differentiation is that the crepe was made-to-go. When you sort of look at what it is composed of, it's pretty simple and straight-forward. 

It's great for people who don't like overly sweet crepes like from Spin or Demetres. But I thought it was a bit bland for my taste. I more or less bought into the \"Japanese crepes\" name and that the shop is one of a kind in Toronto at the moment. If I ever come back to try something else and like it a lot more, then I will change my review. For now, trying it once is enough and I probably won't go back if I decide on buying the crepe."}
{"text":"Atmosphere OK (not many places to sit, it's a small place). Food OK (not as good as I expected). I had the mango parfait and the crepe cake."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum! 
Millie Creperie has some of the best desserts I know. I really enjoy their crepe cakes, I've had the green tea cake and the original. Very soft and delicate! A little chewy too - you know crepe cake is fresh if it's easy to cut into, which it is here!
I also like their crepes with gelato. The gelatos are so flavourful and smooth! I had the Mango Tango and the House Special, which is mango gelato and green tea gelato, respectively, with strawberries and homemade whipped cream. It's a sweet and light dessert, good for sharing! 
This place is great. I definitely stop by here when I'm in Kensington."}
{"text":"I came here for some dessert after eating at Kensington market. I ordered the green tea crepe. I definitely liked it but I thought that the green tea and the pancake was nothing out of this world. The presentation was cute but a little difficult to eat. 

The service is friendly and a cute shop. I would come back to try the cakes which I've heard are really good!"}
{"text":"I came to try out Millie Creperie a few years ago and ordered their Green Tea Parfait and their Japanese Special crepe. The crepe was absolutely delicious--the ice cream was good and the crepe itself was prefectly.....crepey! However I remember being a little disappointed with the parfait (which looked so good in picture), and since I could get crepes elsewhere, I didn't ever come back.

I was at near and around Kensington yesterday and wanting to try out their Millie Crepe cakes, I decided to drop by. I was once again drawn to the Green Tea Parfait and decided to save the Millie Crepe for next time. And I am glad I did because IT WAS SOOO GOOD! There was so much green tea ice cream and the cereal crunch added great texture and flavour to the green tea and cream layer. I can't believe I haven't been frequenting this place more the last few years (honestly...what was I thinking before?! This place is great!). Now, Millie Creperie will always be on my mind when I'm downtown."}
{"text":"When other reviews say this place can be busy... they are so right AND even in the middle of winter too!  It's a tiny tiny shop that delivers unique Japanese spin on the French crepes.  Freshly made and filled with traditional Japanese flavours, these are quite good!

We arrived on a late Saturday in the middle of winter and already all 6 tiny tables were taken up and there was a mini line up.  We quickly looked at the sweet menu and the Japanese special was calling my name.  Quickly they went to making the crepe and in less than 5 minutes, I had a large dessert in my hands.  I had 2 large scoops of green tea ice cream, strawberries throughout the crepe, whip cream, matcha sauce, and a large smear of red bean all long the crepe.  Oh wow... this was very good.  It's not always the easiest to eat but damn... I would do this again especially in the summer!

For under $10, you get a large wonderful and freshly made dessert ... this beats most restaurant desserts and well worth the wait or even standing out in the cold to eat!  I'll definitely return to try more."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The crepes are definitely delicious. I highly recommend the Kakuni crunch, which is pork belly and corn flakes. If you're there for dessert, the green tea crepe. You can watch them prepare it right in front of you. Their gelato is amazing and they're always introducing new flavours. Thai Iced Tea is simply amazing and my new favourite. Finally, their signature Millie crepe cakes are a game changer, and nothing like it in Toronto. They have a wonderfully light yet flavourful texture, and I'm wishing they bring back the Tiramisu flavour soon.  The staff is super friendly and accommodating and great to talk to."}
{"text":"Highly recommend!!! I got there around 7:40 and didn't have to wait in line. Which was literally 5 mins before a huge group of people came to order!! Lucky us! 

The original crepe cake was SOOO paper thin, and good. It was made just right. Not too sweet not too plain. 

Green tea crepe cake was sold out already :( so we'll be back to try that another time.

We also got the Japanese special cone.. I forget it's exact name. It was OK. I guess at first I didn't know how Id eat it.. but we figured it out perfectly fine lol. 

The greentea gelato in the cone was really strong. (Taste was strong) I'm currently super sick.. So I thought I'd taste nothing but i was wrong. 

I think I prefer the crepe cakes more than the crepe cone. 

I haven't tried the parfaits so hopefully I'll try that next time along with the green tea crepe cake! 

Literally a hidden gem in Kensington. 

Right next to the P-arking (im always there but never saw Millie's before) it's a super small little Jap dessert spot. I would say try to avoid lines? But if not im sure it'll be worth the wait anyways!"}
{"text":"Green tea crepe cake ($7.50) 
I've been around trying a bunch of crepe cakes and I must say, Mille creperie has one of the best crepe cakes in Toronto. Can you believe there's 20 paper thin crepe layers in this cake? In between the soft layers of crepes had a smooth green tea cream. Love the texture and the green tea taste."}
{"text":"This place got some serious crepes. Banana split crepes, Japanese special crepes, and mango tango crepes?  Oh my goodness, take my money please!  I want it alllllllllllll!!!!!  

They make it fresh on the spot.  The place is quite small, only got a few tables. The best is to take it and go. Whoever lives around this place, you are so lucky!

With every review, I always ask will I come back?  The answer is yes for sure!

Food:  5/5
Ambience: 4/5
Service:  5/5
Cleanliness:  5/5"}
{"text":"I heard about this place a few years ago and always wanted to try it. Unfortunately I never got the chance to until recently! One reason I always wanted to go was this place had my name in it and I'm a sucker for that. 

I ordered the Japanese special which had the green tea ice cream, whip cream, and strawberries. The crepe itself was good. It was a large amount so I didn't finish it but overall, I would say it was decent. It was nothing particularly special about it but it was a decent crepe that I would order again."}
{"text":"I've tried the green tea and original crepe cakes, the green tea crepe with icecream (I think it's the special), and Thai iced tea gelato. 

I liked everything but I just felt that all the items are overpriced... That's prob why I'd rather go to other nearby desert places even tho I like Millie. I'd take my friends who aren't from Toronto here for their first time but I wouldn't come here often myself"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of crêpes, and yes, I have tried many crêpe locations in Toronto.
Millie Creperie is definitely the best."}
{"text":"tried Japanese special crepe and green tea parfait, the crepe became soggy at the end, personally i dont like the flakes in the parfait but the ice cream had strong matcha taste which i liked it so much. only few tables inside the store, i would suggest to go. overall, it's a good place to try if you live nearby."}
{"text":"Just go now. Just.. Go... Japanese special crepe. On the same level as harajuku in beverly hills. I'll go back to try everything else they have."}
{"text":"so good! not from the area so when i had the cherry blossom crepe cake i had to get one of each to take home. the cherry blossom is still my fav but the others are all quality as well! wish they'd had the tiramisu one while i was there. love the box design, very pretty."}
{"text":"I had their mango parfait. The store was small and straight to the point. Easy to find as it was right on Baldwin when you walk into Kensington market. I like the crunch in the cornflakes but would have preferred to have it without."}
{"text":"Ordered the green tea parfait here at Kensington Market in Chinatown. First time trying it out, after seeing the countless pictures on Instagram haha. It is unique but I probably wouldn't get it again as I've tried similar item at another dessert place before. I'm not a big fan of cereal mixed with ice cream. Though the green tea ice cream is delicious. The shop itself is cozy as it has three tables with two chairs each."}
{"text":"i love Millie Creperie so much!! 
it's a small place, very simply decorated, but it's clean and run by a bunch of awesome ppl (i believe there are two owners? they're both really sweet and so are all the staff). they make every crepe in front of you, so don't go if you're in a rush but it's completely worth it for the final product.

the crepes themselves are thin and not overly sweet, and are arranged in a cone shape with the fillings/toppings evenly distributed in a way that you're able to eat it while walking around kensington or doing whatever. 
they have both sweet and savoury crepes, and i'm a fan of both! the kakuni crunch (pork belly, cornflakes, cheese) and the japanese special (green tea ice cream, whipped cream, red bean, matcha sauce) are the best 2 for diff reasons lol

they also have the mille crepe cake, which is thin layers of crepes with pastry cream (?!) inside of them. it is delicious, pretty pricy but i believe it's time-consuming to make so it's worth it

anyway if you can't tell, i think the crepes here are GOOD and if you're in the kensington area (or even if you aren't) you should check it out here because it's a super solid place !!!!"}
{"text":"My fav here is the crepe stacked cakes..... sooo good and smooth. Love the original vanilla flavor my all time fav! Their crepe cones are also really good with the ice cream and fresh fruits. The price is also very fair."}
{"text":"blown away by the deliciousness of the crepes (so airy and light), and the gelato (the green tea gelato in my Japanese Special crepe was packed full of authentic green-tea-ness. also tried my friend's mango, and a sample of the blood orange - i have to come back and get full sized version of these).. My crepes also come with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. It was a perfect little package, and a great afternoon snack during my break from work! Didn't feel too unhealthy after eating it either. There's 2 small outdoor tables, which is great for people watching in Kensington. Would love to come back and try their savoury crepes, although I think I'll always be tempted to get their sweet ones! Double crepe??"}
{"text":"Unique! Best place in Kensington Market. Finally somewhere with some originality. I tried the matcha cake and several of the sweet and savory crepes, and they were all wonderful. Great mix of different flavors and the corn flakes added and nice touch that balanced out the flavors."}
{"text":"Was pretty hyped to try the crepe cake - filing in between layers of crepes. I found it okay - the flavour was similar to a vanilla custard. It isn't memorable as far as desserts go, and for $8 a slice, I don't think it was worth it. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but I think the hype let me down a bit."}
{"text":"Green Tea Crepe Cake was worth every penny to try it once. It's very soft, like taking a bite into a marshmallow. Between the layers is a cream that is not rich, but quite light. It's quite sweet, but not overly so and yet, lacking a bitter matcha taste. Perfect for appealing to a wide audience! 

Original flavour is sweeter, too sweet for my personal preference."}
{"text":"I just had to try this place out after reading all the reviews on Yelp and it definitely did not disappoint! 

We got the Japanese Special which was highly recommended and it was amazing! The crepe was really light and fluffy, the strawberries were plentiful, and the big dollop of green tea gelato was perfect! 

Also, this is more of a personal thing but I was there for several hours so I got to hear a lot of the playlist. At one point a song by Sara Bareilles (my favourite artist) came on which happened to be my ringtone as well so I quickly reached for my phone before realizing it was coming from the laptop. So the owners listen to Sara Bareilles and Kina Grannis so I had to compliment her on her music tastes. Got to meet the two owners after, Carson and Christin and they are swell people, super friendly!! 

So definitely go!"}
{"text":"Millie Creperie has been a place that I've been excited to try for a while now. It's fairly small with only three tables to sit at and those tables only fit about 2-3 people. The service was good. The staff was very friendly and tried their best to help you if you had any questions. I ordered the Japanese special crepe which was about $7.90 and it came with strawberries, whipped cream, azuki, green tea gelato and matcha sauce. The green tea gelato had the perfect texture and taste. They stuffed it fairly well so by the end of it, I had some trouble eating it. Nothing to complain about as this place was decently priced, tasted well and had great service! 

Will be back to try their parfaits and their famous crepe cake!"}
{"text":"Wow! The best crepe I have had thus far! I had the banana split crepe (banana, strawberries, vanilla gelato, chocolate sauce, and nutella) it comes wrapped in a crepe cone of deliciousness. Must try :)"}
{"text":"I love pumpkin pie so when they put that in a crepe I knew that magical things were happening at this place.  They also featured an apple pie crepe, which was equally as tempting, but it was apple filling instead of pie.
The combination of ice cream, pumpkin pie, and whip cream encased in the crepe was heavenly.
However, the actual store itself has about 6-8 chairs.  So if you're staying in and it's busy - good luck.  More over, I found the employees a little dry.  When I asked if we could get the crepe on a plate instead, they replied with a no because that's how they did Japanese crepes.  It's nice that they want me to be part of the experience, but work with me here y'know?"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to meet up to catch up so we decided to stop by for a sweet & cool treat. I've seen this shop pop up on BlogTO recommendations and wanted to visit it. It was a lot smaller than I imagined, there were two people servicing the store. When we got there the store was completely empty. I ordered the Mango tango while my friend chose the Japanese special. Since the weather was nice we decided to sit outside where a couple of stools were placed in front of the store. Overall it was a yummy treat, but nothing that amazed me. I ate it quite fast but my friend kind of struggle with eating it. (The gelato melts!!) it was a cute store to drop by and try out :) 
From past reviews I've read, the crepe cake is the steals the spotlight so maybe next time I'll give it a try; it is however on the pricey side (~$8) for a tiny slice!"}
{"text":"This is such a cute little Japanese sweet/bakery shops. What I love about it the most is that things are always available and you don't have to have a ridiculous line up like a lot of other Japanese dessert places. Their seating availability is a little cramped, I would just grab it and go and take a nice stroll in Kensington market :)

I've tried their Millie crepes cakes and it's really good. I've tried the lady M ones from New York and I really can't tell the difference, it's both so creamy and delicious and has a great texture. I'd also recommend trying their savoury crepes like rabbit food, it's quite drool worthy and the flavour blend so well. Their parfaits is also a must try too, I love how they put cornflakes in it, it makes it so crunchy with the ice cream. This is a great place to try those Japanese crepes that are so popular in Japan! I recently started coming here for their Thai ice cream gelato. I usually hate Thai ice tea cause it's waaaay to strong, but as a gelato it tastes pretty damn good. Wish they had milk tea flavor too."}
{"text":"Ordered a banana split parfait and a cup of chai tea gelato. The parfait wasn't anything to rave about, though we did enjoy the gelato as it was a unique flavor.

Not much room to sit down but the service was great and everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Millie Creperie is not my favorite place for crepes. The location is cozy (small but comfortable). The staff is friendly. Millie Creperie serves up some picture perfect food. Unfortunately, the layered cake had infringed on the fundamental laws of food. 

While the crepes and ice cream parfait were decent, the layered crepe cake was not. The slice of cake had a revolting fridge taste. Considering a slice is around $7-8. It is unacceptable. Aside from the fridge flavor, the cake was heavy. Perhaps it was my luck, but given my experience at Millie, I will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"First time trying this dessert! I love green tea anything (yum!). The consistency and texture of the cake is soft and the green tea is not too sweet or too bitter. Goes for around $7-8/per slice. The store is quite small and it's packed in a box with a paper bag. There are some stools outside the store if you wanted to sit and eat. Would come back again!"}
{"text":"One of the best mango gelato I've ever had. The mango tango is so good! Mango gelato with strawberries and whipped cream wrapped in a soft crepe with slightly crispy edges. The only negative is, I've ordered a double scoop of just mango gelato a few times and each time they've been the smallest kiddie scoops. You could mashed the 2 scoops to get a regular scoop elsewhere. At about $7 for a double scoop in a cup, it should be bigger."}
{"text":"It's a small shop in the Kensington market. There is a few tables and chairs, limited seating. 

My favorite location. This location is open later than the other one. I always come here for matcha Mille crepe cakes. They are delicious. The crepe layers are soft and cream is smooth.  

They also have both sweet and savory crepes here. I've ordered the sweet ones and they are one of the best crepes i've tried. The crepes are freshly made, thin and soft. The whip cream is creamy and smooth. The gelato is just delicious and not to sweet and the fruits are always fresh. 

This is one of my go to places for dessert. If you haven't tried it. You should definitely try."}
{"text":"I got the mango tango crepe and my boyfriend got the rabbit food. Both were freshly made and were very good. I was impress they used a lot of spinach in the rabbit food and the spicy mayo made it
even better. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Soooo good. I love the idea. It's so beautiful and really good as well. And it's in Kensington ! Moreover the staff is really nice. I really suggest you this place"}
{"text":"There's finally a Japanese Style Creperiein Toronto, so we decided to head over 2 weeks ago to the newly open Millie Creperie (@milliecreperie). It's on the outer side and also quieter side of Kensington Market on Baldwin and Spadina.

  There was no sign and you may easily pass by without noticing it. There's a few sitting space inside and a few chair outside. I wonder if they'll have a hard time in the winter with the limited space inside and the main ingredient of the crepes is ice cream.

The sweet menu and they also have a savory menu or make to order crepe with your own choice of fillings.

Japanese Crepe is very different from the French Crepe we are use to both in preparation and presentation. These are sweeter and crispier with raw fillings.

 Japanese Special Crepe $6.75
~ Strawberry, azuki, green tea gelato, matcha sauce and whipped cream
~ The Japanese Crepe are in cone shape and are meant to be eaten on the go instead of a sit down fork and knife French version. 
~ Although I am a sucker for the cute presentation, I still prefer the french version better since this is too sweet for me. 
~ But I do like all the component here and would have this again in a heartbeat.

Verdict :
~ Anyone who haven't try a Japanese Style Crepe must pay Millie Creperie a visit
~ I think they definitely need a sign since they don't have the most perfect location.~
~ Would love to come back to try the savoury crepe and the parfaits."}
{"text":"Millie Creperie truly has the thinest crepes in town while nailing the plentiful sweet OR savoury filling!

//THE CREPES//
Japanese Special (4/5) - really lightweight and not too sweet. The matcha gelato was delicious and the simple toppings of strawberry and whipped cream complimented it well.
Pork Belly Okonomiyaki (5/5) -  lots of pork belly and the salty savoury okonomiyaki sauce and sauteed carrots & cabbage just melts in your mouth and warms the belly! 

//OVERALL//
I would come back again to try their crepe cakes or more savoury crepes! I do want to mention that still like the sweet crepes at T-swirl better though (even if they're $1 more, T-swirl's extra toppings are worth it)."}
{"text":"Took a day trip today to Kensington market just to try Millie's and it was worth the trip! We had the Japanese special and the mango tango and it was very satisfying! Would definitely go back here again!"}
{"text":"A friend and I were having dinner in the area and came here for dessert after a quick Yelp search! We were on a mission for anything green tea-flavored, so it didn't take us too long to decide on the green tea crepe cake and the green tea gelato parfait. Both were amazing and had a strong green tea flavor, but wasn't overly sweet. The crepe cake was perfectly creamy and fluffy. And the green tea gelato worked so well with the flavors of azuki (red bean) paste, whipped cream and strawberries. I also loved the addition of cornflakes in the parfait as it added some crunch! 

There is very little seating here (only 3-4 small tables) and prices are rather high (our total came to ~$15), but I will definitely be back to try some of their other gelato flavors and crepes. I just won't be here too often. Haha I guess we'll see how good my self-control is..."}
{"text":"My friends rave about this place a lot and it's no wonder that they do given the originality of the crepes they serve here. I've come here before but this is my first time writing a review so here goes.

The shop itself is relatively small and cramped and only has a few tables and seats which are still closely knitted. I don't usually stay to eat but it's a cute place to hang out if you want to catch up with friends. Servers are friendly and they're quick with their service. 

I got the Japanese special which comes with green tea gelato and azuki. The gelato was A+, seriously. The azuki wasn't much to taste since by the time you actually get down there, it had already been reduced to a mushy mess. It was fun to eat though but can get a little messy. Make sure you leave with some napkins!

Only downside is the lack of space. Only reason why I don't stay to eat is because it's too tight and a bit on the loud side if the place is full.

I'd still come back and visit though. It's just nice."}
{"text":"This little shop is a little gem tucked away in Kensington Market.  Available to you are different cakes, ice cream, drinks and crepes.  The crepes are divided into both savoury and sweet, so it's not just about dessert.
I ordered a mango parfait.  It's a combination of ice cream, real fruits and corn flakes.  So simple and yet so delectably delicious!!  
Service was ok.  One associate took the order and the other fulfilled.  They got most of the orders correct though there was a slight confusion.  But then and again our group was large and it would be easy to get our orders wrong.  Writing about this place and thinking about the mango parfait is making me want to go back for more."}
{"text":"Had the mango ice cream w strawberries wrapped in a crepe. It was delicious. Small place. Friendly. 7 bux well priced. The mango ice cream was really good! Wonder if they made it in house. The crepe was fluffy but not overly sweet. Would come back."}
{"text":"Great staff, amazing service, delicious food. Visited this place at 1AM and it was somehow open and the staff member was there and he invited us in even though it was closed. He was super friendly and nice, had a nice conversation. Green tea ice cream had to be the best I've had in this city, great taste and quality. Would go back again!"}
{"text":"Thought this store was about millie crepes, but people seemed to order their Japanese crepes. I got the millie crepe anyway which had good flavors but was a little too creamy for my liking."}
{"text":"In my own opinion, this is the best creperie place in town! Although it could be busy at times, however for any matcha-loving sweet tooth like myself, the wait is worth it.

In addition, it is really a good bargain if you are to purchase an entire crepe cake, instead of single slices. My boyfriend has gotten me the signature matcha crepe cake several times, and I can always finish them within 3 days (shows how good they are!).

Update - April 29, 2018
After having the famous Lady M in Manhattan, I really think this place deserves a five-star, as I found this place to be better than M in terms of the level of sweetness, crepe texture, whipped cream consistency, and level of matcha bitterness."}
{"text":"We got the mango tango and green tea cake. Both tasted delicious! The space was pretty small, limited seating. Mango tango was especially delightful, it is a crepe wrap with ice cream, fruit and whipped cream."}
