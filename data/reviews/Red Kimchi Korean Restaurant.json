{"text":"Nice family owned restaurant. Good taste. Lots of rice."}
{"text":"This place is totally a joke. It's the worst Korean restaurant I have been to. It took 10 minutes to get a drink and 30+ minutes to get your food served. We went there on a Friday night and there was only one server!! The environment is bad and the smoke is everywhere. It's our first time and also the last time to dine here."}
{"text":"worst Korean food ever.  marinated beef has no taste or sauce. i ordered Jasmin tea. but i got regular green tea bag. Kimchi soup was cooked with chicken noodle soup broth.  if you want authentic Korean food - DO NOT STEP IN TO THIS PLACE!  did I mention the price is also off limit?"}
{"text":"PROS: 1.  EXCELLENT food.  I've never had a meal that was less than absolutely fabulous here.  The Korean side dishes are amazing and the kimchee is amazing.   2.  Good service.  3.  Nice variety of dishes.    CONS: 1.  I live in N. Scottsdale, so it's a little far.  Seriously, I really enjoy eating here.  Clean, comfortable and a little funny because of the disco lights and the speakers so it's got that \"probably an underground Korean dance club\" feel."}
{"text":"This place is on point! I have been living in Korea the last nine months, and I am at home visiting family. I took my wife here so she could try Korean food. She loved it. It's not as spicy as what I usually get in Korea but still good! Going back for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying I am half Asian and grew up on my Korean stepmother's excellent food, so I know what good Korean food tastes like. It's been a few months since I ate a late lunch here one time, but I remember it clear as day because it was so damned terrible.   The restaurant was stuffy and humid (poor ventilation), the service was abysmal, as in I had to wait over five minutes for the menu when the place only had one other table of three in attendance, the banchan were lukewarm--almost at room temperature, and my bento entree of dwehji bulgogi was mediocre.  It included a depressing looking lettuce salad that tasted like it had been languishing in the presumably hot kitchen so long that all the crispness of the lettuce had died a sad, untimely death.  It did not include carrot, cucumber or any of the side vegetables usually found in bento salads.  The pork was well sliced but it didn't have enough chili flavor to it.  It was also lukewarm.    The service was lousy.  I was waved to a table, not walked to it.  Then I sat there for far too long, and when the menu finally  did arrive it was plopped in front of me, even though I had one hand raised to take the menu.  Finally, the owner made no eye contact with me, the ultimate customer service insult.  Since that visit, I have not returned.  I notice that the customers who gave this place five stars are generally gringo Americans.  The Asians who reviewed this place were far less generous, and that's because we know that this establishment needs to get on its game."}
{"text":"I go there about once a month for my fixation of the Korean crave .... there is just not many choice near the North Scottsdale/Phoenix area  ...   I usually have the Galbi and a Stew, Galbi is pretty good and the stew and side dishes are ok. Good but not great ... The waiter is always very nice and very talkative. Overall service was good and the place seems clean.  Not a very busy place, so it makes a good place to sit down and catch up.   Recommend"}
{"text":"As far as I can tell this is 1 of only 3 Korean restaurants in the Phoenix area. I've been here a couple times for soup, BBQ, and Soju. The food is definitely authentic with a couple different meats: kalbi short ribs, Chicken or beef bulgogi. There are a couple different tofu and seafood soups, bi bim bap, rice dishes, etc..   Last time I was there, I brought my brother for BBQ meats and Hite. The full spread of kimchis, bean sprouts, and other korean staples were brought out. We order way to much meat, ended up on a Soju bing, and started an overly enthusiastic conversation with the owner about trips to Seoul. We had a great time, and the food turned out great too.  I would certainly recommend this restaurant if you're craving Korean food, it'll satisfy your Kimchi withdrawls until that next trip to Seoul."}
{"text":"We live in Scottsdale, and this is the closest Korean restaurant. We've been here multiple times since moving here. It is definitely a mom and pop type place. The waiter/hostess is likely the husband or brother of the cook. The food is delicious, I've had the tofu soup, Bulgogi, Kimchi Fried rice, Bibimap, Kalbi. It's all excellent. The only complaint I have is that it does take a long time for your food to come out but it is well worth it. I wish their menu was a little bit larger with more selection and authentic dishes like Takamatsu but I'll have to drive there if I want that. The staff has always been friendly and I hope they continue to do well!"}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by my visit here. I stood up front, waiting to be seated for about 5 minutes. The employees made eye contact with me on several occasions and made no indication that I was able to seat myself and/or were about to assist me. I am a big fan of Korean food, but an even bigger advocate of good customer service. I am unable to provide a rating for the food, as I eventually walked out."}
{"text":"been here a few times in the past 3 years and it has changed ownership several times as well. I love korean food especially the bulgogi and kalbi. I like that they serve those little dishes on top of your order like kimchie, seaweed salad, etc. This place however has gone downhill since I've been there. The food is not that fresh. so sad..."}
{"text":"Had lunch at the restaurant with a party of four and decided to select from the dinner menu: as shared appetizers we took the kimchi pancake and the plate with rice cakes followed by, for each of us, the dolsot bibimbap. Having lived for 4 years in Korea, I was really surprised by the authentic taste of the preparations and the quality of the food. My guests who have been frequenting regularly Korean restaurants in Japan were equally pleased and together we finished the whole meal up until the last rice grain. The service was friendly and the prices reasonable (although not as cheap as those of the lunch menu). The set up of the dining area was simple and clean, which also contributed to an authentic Asian ambiance for all four of us. Definitively a place to come back any time soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointing for several reasons: 1. As soon as I entered the restaurant, a bad odor greeted me. I can't imagine enjoying dinner with that smell. 2. I ordered my food Togo and was shocked by how bad the food was. Their tofu beef soup tasted powdery and it had chewy cubes of beef in it. Their bibimap barely had any meat in it and was nothing special. I could have done a better job. 3. It was expensive for such a poor meal.   Will not be returning. Save your time and your money and go to Takamatsu instead."}
{"text":"Good food served in a clean and comfortable restaurant. Definitely worth a try in my opinion. I'm not about to tell you it's 100% authentic (which I think is highly subjective snobbery) like all ethnic restaurants immersed in other countries they have obviously made concessions with regard to certain ingredients but it still maintains an excellent overall Korean feel.   The Banchan (6 small side dishes) were a colorful and tasty treat with the right mix of traditional sides like Kimchi and Muchae along with some other dishes that I was unable to identify. The spicy BBQ from the kitchen was good but nothing truly unique or remarkable. The restaurant also seems set up for tabletop pulgoki also known Korean BBQ marinated in a sauce made with soy, garlic, sugar, sesame oil, and other seasonings depending on what part of the country you happen to be in at the moment. I definitely plan on going back to either take a stab at a table top pulgoki feast or gleefully burning the place down using my table top cooker depending on how much booze I can get my hands on before they bring out the raw meat.  In closing if your really looking for the most 100% authentic Korean dishes possible, then by all means go buy a ticket get on a plane and take a lil jaunt over to Pyongyang. Since the current government seems intent on freezing time there I'm sure you'll find a variety of palate pleasing experiences in the work camps.  Side note: This place apparently changed ownership sometime in the last year and is now called Red Kimchi."}
{"text":"Hmmm.  I want to give this place more stars, especially since I will probably go back, but having lived in San Francisco and visited Korea recently, I can't give this place any more than three.   With that being said, I was craving Korean food, and left there very full.  The appetizers that they bring out (kim-chee, etc..) were good.  They had OB beer, which is always a plus.  The BBQ chicken was good, although marinated in something other than a Korean marinade.  The kalbi was all on the bone, which I don't prefer.  All in all, it was a good experience, but I am still looking for that amazing Korean food that they have in Korea, and San Francisco"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and love the bulgogi and dolsot bibimbap and the banchan but today I tried the ahi bap which is simply one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten.  It came in the hot stone pot like the dolsot bibimbap with the delicious crusty rice at the bottom but had ingredients that were new to me.  Because it's a Japanese rather than a Korean dish it didn't come with the banchan I love but the black milk tea with boba was superb.  I love bibimbap so much I've bought the authentic stoneware bowls and made the dish at home but when I'm lazy and want someone else to do the prep, Red Kimchi is a welcoming and reasonably priced alternative.  Service was attentive and prompt.  Now I wish I had the ahi bap recipe!"}
{"text":"It is a little bit hard to find the right place because there are so many restaurants over there. But the dishes are so GREAT! I ordered spicy grilled chicken and grilled pork. They can grill those things for u in a traditional way instead of doing that by yourselves. They gave us a dish of fruits with cream as a dessert for free. I think I will ask more friends to go with me next time."}
{"text":"Everything is delicious. You can't go wrong with the dolsot bibimbap and the galbi is extremely tender and flavorful. They give generous portions of the banchan sides and the people are very friendly and accommodating. I recommend if you're looking for good Korean food in the valley."}
{"text":"I was here with husband for lunch. When our orders were arrived on the table, the old sides were awful and very disappointed. Hamul soon tofu soup was not good, too. I never come here again."}
{"text":"I found this place while I was in search of a Korean restaurant to go to while a long-time friend was in town, and since I've gone here several times.   The food is excellent, the boba tea/smoothie/coffee (I particularly like the mocha boba!) are to die for, and service is excellent. The noise levels are always low (mostly because not many people in this area crave Korean), but there's usually some K-pop playing in the background so it's not TOTALLY silent.   The price is the only thing that keeps me from going there more often, but the quality of the food is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"A great family owned local restaurant. Always on my lists of places to stop and eat lunch.  Really good prices and the owner is very friendly.  The lunch specials are very decently priced and you get a lot of food."}
{"text":"First visit,  5 of us for dinner and all raved about the food. Noted many Koreans dining. Second visit, 2 for dinner and it again was very, very good.  C.J. Young, the manager/owner? is a hoot.  The waiter is quite expressionless and non-communicative but the food was excellent.  We are big on soups, and not disappointed!"}
{"text":"I go here with my girlfriend and I had the very best ribs ever. It's called Galbi, basically it's sliced beef ribs with korean spices and flavoring.  The restaurant owner is extremely friendly, and offers great service. We've gotten takeout before as well as we got extra Kimchi at request at no extra cost."}
{"text":"We had just arrived at Phoenix and craving for some Korean food. Found this one and we were very impressed with the food and service. Food was not top notch but very good."}
{"text":"Located in remote Scottsdale area where you'd think genuine ethnic korean cuisine would be nowhere, I was actually impressed by their genuine flavors and menu selection. After a long biz trip, was craving some good korean food so I ordered steamed dumplings (mandoo) and spicy beef soup (yookgaejang). Both were very good.   I probably did go in with very low expectations, nonetheless I truly enjoyed both. They were served with usual array of korean side dishes, of which I only enjoyed sampling the pickled cucumber, kimchi, and seasoned fish cake. Ironically, their kimchi was the worst in taste. It seemed about 2 weeks beyond its pickling stage, which would explain they turn their customers slowly with low daily volume. It probably would make a great kimchi jjigae, as it's known that secret ingredient in making some best versions of these hot spicy kimchi stew come from extra pickled kimchi that's been left over fermented after recommended serve period.   Restaurant was small and offered sushi selection. There were few tables already being served as it was early lunch time. Service from lady was good but she appeared busy as she seemed to be both my server and the cook. There was a man working the sushi bar and appeared to be focused on sushi prep for the day.  Ironically, their   Restroom was acceptably clean. And plenty of soap!"}
{"text":"I have to give it up for this place because as far as I know, they are the only place in the Valley that serves my all-time favorite dish, dolseot bibimbap (rice with vegetables and eggs served in a sizzling hot stone bowl!) Korean food is fantastic, if only because no matter what you order, you are presented with a number of side dishes as part of the meal. The prices are pushing reasonable limits, but I suppose they factor the side dishes into that. The only reason this place doesn't get a full five stars from me is because there was a very strange, metallic smell towards the front of the restaurant when you first come in, which could compromise the appetites of some. So be forewarned. But my food was great and I'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been craving Korean food since I left NYC and had access to \"little Korea\", wow was I impressed with the Galbi, portions were ok, somewhat pricey but food was great so I don't sweat it.  Owner was very friendly and take out was quick.  Would definitely go back again and again.  Try the Galbi beef, made from angus cuts.  YUMMY"}
{"text":"This is a cute little family owned spot, I've been here twice now, and have had great experiences both times.   Since my mom is Korean, I have pretty high expectations for Korean food, and this place did not disappoint! The food is definitely authentic, and the owner is very friendly. We went once on a Thursday night, and there were a few other parties there, but not very crowded. The next time, we got carry out on a Saturday night and when we went to pick it up, the place was packed! The carry out did not take very long, probably 20 minutes total from ordering to pickup.   We have tried all the staples, dolsot bibimbap, galbi, and bulgogi. They all come with the normal side dishes, and are all delicious. There is so much food, but make sure to save room for the Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream because that is the best part!"}
{"text":"Half of my kalbi was cold and the solution to the problem was to order more and get I would get a little extra? No thank you. Portions are even smaller when ordered to go as well. What happened to this place?"}
{"text":"I am having a late lunch stop for the first visit.  As with many international family run small business restaurants I understand the simple decor.  It is all about the food.  It is larger than it appears and has many Korean favorites on the menu.  K-pop on the soundsystem and sushi rolls on the menu too.  Grateful to have a Korean bbq place nearby.  It has a decent variety to the menu.  I ordered dalk bulgolgi- chickengrilled marinated korean style"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. The service is excellent. Since there are not many Korean places in town this one is a good place to try. I love that they play Korean music in the background (mostly K Pop). I tell all my friends to go here and I usually take them with me."}
{"text":"I come here frequently, and my favorite dishes are always consistently delicious. There was a review by J**** G. These workers are very polite and of gentle nature. Their service is better than those pushy waiters at other restaurants i have been to. When you do come in, do sit wherever you please, because they aim to please. If you like being told what to do, go somewhere else. They are quick with their drinks. At one point, one of the staff let me taste different soju because I was buying the same stuff.   Do no listen to rants of others. Go try for yourself. It gets busy from time to time, but they are always trying to be quick as humanly possible. They do not rush you, so you can leave when you are done at your own pace."}
{"text":"The dolsot bimbibap was spectacular. The dish my vegetarian girlfriend ordered received great reviews from her as well. We also enjoyed their selection of Korean Imports for drinks.   My only critique was that it seemed understaffed. The service was good, but there was only one man for about 5 tables. I enjoyed the food however and encourage people to visit. The waiter spent time explaining dishes to us which was appreciated."}
{"text":"I went for Boba and am so happy I found this treasure.  I had Thai Tea and it was made in smoothie form with the most delicious chewy Boba.  I might have to make the 30 minute trek just for this delicious drink!  The gentleman that helped was also very nice.  He had just made a fresh batch of Boba.  He also wanted to make sure I was happy with my beverage.  You will not regret a Boba purchase."}
{"text":"Oh man where do I begin?! I was lazy and decided on this place as opposed to hodori (which is my usual) simply because it was closer. First the waitress was unintelligent and knew nothing about the menu and basic Korean dishes. She literally vocalized the fact she nothing about Korean food. Exact words were \"I'm sorry I don't know Korean food\". My jaw probably dropped when she said that. I should have know to leave then but I thought I'd give this place a sincere try. So I order some nigiri and some soup. The soup tastes like water! This restaurant is stingy and does not use quality kimchi paste and certainly not enough of it. The whole soup tastes flavorless and I struggled to eat the whole thing, getting bored before finishing. There were a measly 6 pieces of beef cubes the size of a penny in there! 6 small not even one bite full cubes of beef. I was so disappointed. Flavorless and full of onion was the soup. Somehow the soup came out before the nigiri, I don't know how or why. But the nigiri looked good! I take the piece with my chopsticks and the rice instantly cracks in half and falls apart. This is a sign of an unskilled sushi chef. After I put my sushi back together again, i mix the wasabi and didn't taste the heat, so I mix a little more and still nothing. I ended up putting the whole wad of wasabi into my soy sauce to get even just a hint of spiciness. This means the wasabi is very old. Like super old. For wasabi to lose its heat completely it must have sat there for days! Eww!! So I take a bite of the nigiri and the rice was crispy, meaning they either recooked the rice from the previous day or it simply dried out due to it not being used immediately. The fish was slimy also that it had been sitting in there for a while. Honestly I'm a bit scared I will vomit the meal back up as I'm writing this... anyway, this restaurant should not be serving sushi. It simply does not get enough business as is to supply quality sushi. Probably due in fact to poor waiter/waitress training and shitty food, people just don't want to eat here enough for decent sushi to be served. Also, their taro boba milk tea is not real taro contrary to what their sign says. Their menu is completely misleading! Not even a small amount of taro is in it and yet the menu makes it sound like real Taro. This was a very disappointing meal."}
{"text":"Killer sushi and funny host!  Awesome job guys."}
{"text":"This place is still open! The rest of the shopping center is a little dilapidated and it looks closed from the outside, but they're still open. Cute family run restaurant and seems authentic to me.   Not the most amazing KBBQ I've ever had, but it was good! I got the lunch chicken bulgogi and the rice was fresh. It came with two potstickers, a salad, and red kimchi. Kinda wish there had been more chicken but the lunch special was a great price (about $9)."}
{"text":"First. In a town where there is only a handful of Korean restaurants, the scarcity SHOULD(and it is a big 'should') seem to make the food taste good.    Second. Again, due to the scarcity of Korean restaurants, if the food is reasonably tasty, then one could overlook the service or lack thereof.  Neither was the case here. Food is mediocre at best. Attentiveness of the servers are non-existent, and I am sorry to say that, certain standards which Korean restaurants are known for is absent here.  Kimchee, which is an essential, I mean essential condiment in Korean food dining, was tasteless. Wait, not tasteless; but bad tasting. I am not a Korean, but I sure do know what Korean food should taste like.  One should not compare this kitchen with those that are in let us say, San Francisco, L.A., or NY.    And it's a good thing my friends also weren't Koreans;  none of them knew what the dishes should taste like.  I was fortunate in that sense."}
{"text":"Great service and great food, left feeling full but not that gross full.  The service was very good, took our order quick, kept everything stocked up which mainly includes drinks and lettuce to wrap up the cooking meat.  Spilled a ton of kimchi on myself, and our waiter was on the spot to get me some soda water and help me clean it out of my shirt.  Super funny guy and very nice.  The food was also amazing, but is not what you may expect.  It tasted and felt way healthier than what you may think when you think about bbq.  A very nice balance of flavors, and the amount of sides to put with the cooked meat and lettuce is wide in range.  Sure it was a bit pricey since my gf only eats at the most chicken, no beef, but if you go with a group it would seem more cost effective.  Still I smashed my face full of as much as I could and walked out feeling great.  Will definitely go back next chance I get!"}
{"text":"Great food! Good portions. It is hard right now to find good authentic Korean food in Phoenix. This is as authentic as any that I have found here. After spending some time in South Korea and lived in Hawaii for 16 years. Red Kimchi takes me back to the food there. Yesterday I ordered bulgogi, jap jae (my wife loves it) and gyoza. Each were excellent.  Very nice portions of each. The bulgogi didn't have a lot of fatty meat. Just the right amount. I've ordered from other Korean places and a lot of times the meat is mostly fat with little meat. I understand what a previous reviewer mentioned about the owner being rude. He tries his best to be funny and welcoming. Sometimes the humor is lost in the cultural differences, but the food talks for itself."}
{"text":"The food was not very good at all.  The portions are very small, yet the prices are average if not slightly more.  It also seems like they will try to sell anything that can make money - edamame, boba teas, gyozas, whatever.  NOT a fan."}
{"text":"Yep this place sucked. Horrible service. Miso soup had no flavor. Meat was small portions compared to competition."}
{"text":"Very decent Korean place. I liked the one on Bethany home rd but it closed. Nothing fancy, but good food."}
{"text":"I went here Saturday night with a party of 7.  It was about 8pm and the place was not that busy.  The owner came up to us right away to greet and seat us.  We were the only gringos in the place so this was a good sign.  I've only had Korean cuisine a handful of times so I'm not that good of a judge when talking about the authenticity or quality of the food.  However, everything I had was excellent.  The bbq ribs were bomb and so was my entree.  I still can't pronounce what my entree was, but it was rice, veggies, beef and egg in this 9,000 degree pot thing.  It was delicious and reminded me of awesome fried rice.  The best part of this place is the owner, HS or \"Hot Stuff\".  He is the most friendly, outgoing, and energetic Korean guy ever.  It is like dinner and a show with this guy.  Among other things takes saki-bombing to another level and makes it quite an event.  Although a bit pricey for what you get, this place is awesome and I can't wait to go back.  Its a fun, locally owned small business that puts out some decent and unique food.  Couple that with a character such as Hot Stuff and you can't miss."}
{"text":"A definite must. Great bibimbap and even better atmosphere. We showed up 30 min before close and they didn't even bat an eye, just rolled out the cart and got to cooking right in front of us. We did the bulgogi table side, which did not disappoint. The kimchi was great, and the pickled beans and tofu were a tasty surprise. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I actually enjoy this place very much. As far as the food goes, I think everything I've tried has been wonderful.  The atmosphere is authentic Asian/Korean, although not really up to American standards.  I highly recommend at least swinging by for the boboa teas though. It's conveniently off Scottsdale road and perfect if you want to grab a drink to go (alternative to Starbucks).  The owner is very friendly and attentive despite being understaffed at peak hours. The price is a bit high, but it's well worth it since some of the dishes cannot be found elsewhere in the area (unless your mom is Korean)."}
{"text":"I like carmized food, my wife calls it \"burnt\" but there is a difference. The stone pot BiBimBap here has nicly carmized rice at the bottom and they are more than willing to replace the meat with tofu here.   The Kimchi and other sides were delectable  Their soft tofu soup was full of flavor  Overall a decent korean otpion, just don't execpt to be stuffed by ordering just one dish."}
{"text":"Traveled across town to this Korean restaurant.  The food was good.  The service was ok, not the best.  We had bulgogi chicken and beef, seafood pancake, tried their boba drinks, and their variety of korean little dishes.  The Bulgogi was good, everything else was ok."}
{"text":"Food: Authentic Korean food. Mom & Pop style.  I had the dolsot bibimbap and yook je jang, which were both excellent. Accompanied by 6 side plates.  It is easily the best and most authentic Korean food that I've had in Scottsdale, mainly because there are no other Korean restaurants in Scottsdale.   Service/Ambience: Prompt and friendly service. The food took relatively long to come out, but not excessively long. The decor of this place is hilariously uncoordinated--random artwork and decor pieces. Makes it feel home-y.  Overall: Considering this is the only Korean restaurant in the Scottsdale area, I give it 4-stars. If it were anywhere in California, I would give it 2 stars. I'll come back to try the BBQ"}
{"text":"Dolsot bibambap and tofu soup were quite tasty! Side dishes were average, with the cucumbers especially being a little too bland. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Here on a Friday night! Just Finished dinner :) quite some people, they only have two servers here tonight so the panchan came out  pretty slow. Ordered sootofu and Bibimpam the portion is a little small, but satiates. Will come here when I don't feel like driving to the east valley."}
{"text":"Everything tasted terrible. The side dishes looked rotten and the soon doo boo was bland. The owner was also preoccupied with watching a show on the laptop so he didnt even know I walked in..... Makes me apprecite BCD even more now back in Cali"}
{"text":"Monday night. On the spur of the moment, my wife & I had dinner at this restaurant. We arrived early enough to beat the crowd. So we were seated & served quickly.   The waiter was very attentive. But he also came across as a bit pushy. He could also be a bit more helpful with recommendations  of dishes at his restaurant. So I deduct half a star.   We had the \"dolsot bibimbap\" & \"gogi bokeum\" with chicken. Both dishes are very good. The \"dolsot bibimbap\" could be a bit more flavorful; I solved this small problem by adding a bit of soy sauce.  So I deduct 1/2 star for this itsy bitsy lack of flavor.  But the rice was so nicely crunchy. Just be careful: the beautiful stone bowl was very hot to the end of dinner.   The chicken \"gogi bokeum\" was spicy, tasty and delicious. I can't recall any issue with this dish.   When the occasion present itself again, we'll be back at this restaurant. A definite recommend."}
{"text":"Food was subpar.  Ordered the seafood soondobu and the seafood did not seem fresh and the soup had no taste except for spicy.  The \"dinner\" portion for kalbi was also small and the beef excessively fatty for the almost  $20 price tag.  the small dishes panjang including the Kimchee, sprouts were sparse and not fresh either.  The service was decent."}
{"text":"Ahhh!  Finally a Korean restaurant by me!  Traveling up and down searching for good Korean food can be hard and tiresome.  This one's right down the street from me.  At first I thought it was just called Korean Restaurant (that's some originality!), but didn't see the little sign \"RED KIMCHI\" on the side.  I'm not a big fan of Korean BBQ since I like the way I smell :) haha!  What I'm a big fan of is the Tofu Seafood soup - Mmm so warm and toasty in my tummy!  Red Kimchi is what I expect from a Korean restaurant -- good tofu soup, Hite beer, great service, and good Asian decors and design -- very clean bathroom by the way haha! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"As soon as I walked in, there was a funny smell. The server also coughed at us as when he was showing us to our seats. I was so grossed out. We couldn't stay. We decided to just go to Hodori."}
{"text":"Went to find some good Korean BBQ and ran across this place. The beef ribs were excellent, spicy pork was decent. The service there was very slow like nonexistent. Didn't enjoy the rice with beef and veggies as had a different seaweed flavor with it. Took a bite and right away let them know but ended up still paying for the uneaten meal. I'll probably look elsewhere next time or just stick to the beef ribs."}
{"text":"Food was kind of bland, a bit overpriced. My girlfriend and I were the only people in the restaurant. Owner was nice.   However, definitely got food poisoning.   Got Ahl Bap and a soft tofu and kimchi soup. Kimchi was the best part."}
{"text":"Whenever we travel we always look for a Korean restaurant and Red Kimchi was the only place that we found in the area.  We went there on Tuesday evening around 8pm and were greeted by friendly owner.   My husband ordered dumpling soup as a starter and he loved it.   My seaweed soup was good as well.   We shared the hot stone pot Bibimbop and spicy squid saute for the main course.    The Bibimbop was very delicious.   My husband especially enjoyed the burnt rice in the bottom.   The squid sauté wad tasty but was not very spicy for us.   The owner said he was afraid to make it too spicy.   There were only five side dishes and the portions were very small.   Overall, we were happy with the meal."}
{"text":"Was there celebrating a birthday. The service was horrible from the hostess to the server to the bartender. It was my 1st (and last) time there, and I had some questions on the menu. The server was not knowledgeable and recommend the soft tofu, which I am now suffering from food poisoning."}
{"text":"Boba!  Yes, I said boba.  Boba as in \"a name for the sweet, chewy, tapioca balls found at the bottom of the Taiwanese bubble tea/boba tea drink.\"  There are few places that have boba in the Valley, and after seeing a sign out front of Red Kimchi on several occasions, I finally decided to go pay them a visit.  I walked in at an odd time... around 5pm on a Tuesday.  I was heading to a meeting and not sure how long it would be, so I wanted a little something to hold me over until dinner.  The restaurant was empty except for all of their staff sitting at a table in the back eating.  I felt like I was interrupting but once I was in, I wasn't going to turn around and walk out.  I came in for boba and I was going to leave with boba!  I felt kind of awkward as I just wanted a boba to-go, but they sat me at a table while I waited... I perused the menu of boba choices and narrowed it down to either green tea, mango, or strawberry boba.  I asked the guy for his input and he asked if I wanted it to be low cal or not.  When I said, yes, I'd prefer the low cal option, he convinced me to go with the green tea flavor.  Imagine my surprise when he brought me my drink five minutes later and it tasted like ice cream!  I really really doubt it was low cal, but I decided to \"suck it up\" quite literally... and it was delicious!  I took a menu with me and since then, decided I need to return sometime soon to give their Korean food a shot.  Hopefully when I do, it will be a less-awkward experience.  If you're up for joining me for Korean sometime, let me know!  And regardless, go check out Red Kimchi's boba and yelp about it so I can see what you think!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to find a Korean restaurant here in Arizona and I think I found it!    I love that they bring out the plates of pickled items. My favorites are the bean sprouts with the sesame oil, the pickled cucumber, and the radish. For dinner, I ordered the bulgogi, which is a marinated, thin sliced beef with caramelized onions. The bulgogi has a very subtle sweetness to it which goes nice with the savory of the meat. The meat was very tender and was soaked nicely in the marinade juices. The dish comes with rice and a plate of lettuce with raw garlic and jalapeños so that you can make your own wraps. There was also a Korean style BBQ sauce that you could dip your wraps into. I liked the sauce. I'm not sure what was in it but it didn't taste like a traditional American BBQ sauce. It was pretty good.   The service was great my water was never empty and we were checked on regularly. I'm assuming it was the owner that also swung by quite often, but he was hilarious. He would do magic tricks, tell jokes, and mingle for a bit. He seemed to interact only with the tables that were welcoming to his company. His magic tricks were pretty fun."}
{"text":"Food is authentic, but not fresh or of good quality.  Dining area is filthy (sticky tables, dirty floor, foul odor)  and was full of gnats.  So many in our food and all over the table and swarming around our faces that we were not able and did not want to eat.  We had to leave the food on the table and go elsewhere.  Even if this place were bug-free, I would not eat here again.  Poor quality food and not a clean establishment."}
{"text":"Accidentally ran into this one after visiting the Botanical Garden today. Ordered a beef kimchi toufu which was horrible-beef must be old and had a bite that actually tasted rotten. Rice must be left over from last night with chunks in the bowl."}
{"text":"Good portions and authentic korean food. Classic moms and pops restaurant. Don't get thrown off by the decor, the food is great!"}
{"text":"It's a awful place ever, we went there five times, and four times closed. How Can a restaurant always closed????????????"}
{"text":"As a child of Asian immigrant parents who also owned a small business, I feel truly sad to present them with a mediocre review.   The owner seemed extremely friendly amidst a business that isn't doing so well.  I would rather this review serve as a wake-up call or maybe inspire a relocation, because I really do want them to do well.   The decoration of the place seems quite outdated (probably the red plush seats...very 80s) - but it does indeed have a warm Asian household vibe with the murals and Korean music playing in the background.   As the only patron in the whole establishment during lunch hour, their prices and portions are really generous. This should be a great attraction for nearby ASU, but Papago plaza is filled with vacant storefronts and there's simply no walk-in customers.   Now if their food was delicious, their location wouldn't be such an issue. It's not- I ordered the Kimchi soondubu and Bulgogi lunch, and both just seemed really off.   The soondubu was 85% water, and the consistency of the soup threw off the whole dish. Maybe I'm under the impression that it should be a tofu stew and not a tofu soup, but at least the flavors were good. There was no inquiry about spice level, and that makes me wonder if the dish was already pre-made.  The bulgogi had an overwhelming vinegar flavor, and would rank as one of the worst I've ever had at a Korean restaurant.  I guess I'm also skeptical of how fresh the food can be when I'm the only person here and many of their food items are seafood-based.   Maybe I just came on an off-day, and hopefully this isn't Dream Cafe (Seinfeld) in Arizona and they start to thrive. I love supporting local businesses but I'm not sure if I'll come back"}
{"text":"Oh God, this place was awful. This is hands down the worst Korean food I have tasted in my life (no exaggeration). This is what Korean food would probably taste like in rural North Dakota (no offense, North Dakotans!). I really have nothing good to say about this place.   This place is expensive and serves significantly smaller portions than typical korean restaurants. The $15 seafood pancake (which had very little seafood and  tasted very fishy/gross) was half the size of what would typically served. The $10 soft tofu stew was bland and came in a very small pot (almost like a small bowl); the beef in there was extremely tough.  Our server (very likely the owner) was inattentive and stingy with side dishes; we had to ask him to refill twice because it was simply not enough. The portions started off small, but only got smaller and smaller as we asked for more.  If you want decent korean food, drive a few miles south to Hodori."}
{"text":"Great Korean food.  I primarily order the bool go gi but I've tried a few other things and the food is just all around good.  It's a very low key place.  It's never been all that busy in all the times I've gone there.  If you love Korean food, you'd be remiss to not try this place at least once.  Edit 10/21/2014 Came back here recently.  The place seems to have gone down hill a bit.  The food's not bad but it's not great.  Service was ok but nothing exceptional.  This place used to be a bit better but now I'd recommend just heading over to Hodori near Southern and Dobson."}
{"text":"Based on the yelp reviews, we decided to give it a try since we were in the area. Unfortunately, we probably won't be back. There was a previous review that mentioned the weird smell that hits you when you first walk in and it's definitely there. We had the bolgogi and the dolseot bibimbap.  One of my criteria when writing a review is not just taste, but price to portion size ratio.  This place is quite expensive and relative to taste, it not a very good value.  Got there quite early for dinner, so there was no one there. The bibimbap was good was nothing special and most of the portions we've had at other Korean restaurants (at least in Chicago) are twice the size.  The bolgogi had a good sauce, but the meat had an unpleasant texture.  It either was sitting in the marinade for too long or the added too much meat tenderizer. Whatever it was, it left the meat rather mushy and unappetizing. The other problem was, the kitchen made the bolgogi and I speculate that they did not heat the pan hot enough.  Rather than it coming out a charred/caramel color it came out with no char and kind of a gray color.  For $40, I don't expect a fantastic meal, but I do expect a good one and can't say we got that her."}
{"text":"I don't know why there are bad reviews. The food was very good, both the main course and the side dishes. The waiter was very nice as well, so I don't know why there's hate on the service! We were one of only two tables but I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"A family member recommended this place-- and she is an avid fan of Korean barbeque. I came in hungry after a trip to the chiropractor and found it quite empty for dinnertime.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and they are very friendly. I struck up a conversation with the owner who immediately threw some recommendations at me that I couldn't afford :) Their dinnertime prices will throw you closer to the $15-$20/per entry mark, which was not my budget that night, nor what I would pay for takeout.   So, I chose the Bulgogi with Spicy Chicken to go.The owner then discussed their process for choosing fresh vegetables every day, along with never adding MSG to their products, which he is extremely proud of! Cheers! No MSG is appreciated. I paid $13 for the one meal that he claimed came with lots of veggies and kim chee. Thus, since it was talked up, I was actually a bit disappointed on those specifically... The kim chee was not plentiful at all, actually, we only had four measly dollops of each one. Next, the veggies were a very average amount-- however, they were very fresh. I will definitely give him that. The meat was just... fine! Overall, I liked the owner's optimistic approach to the food and the food's fresh quality. However, I think I will only partake in lunchtime due to the price-to-food quantity ratio."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to review this place for some time. A few of my friends and myself decided to give this place a try on some random late night food adventure last winter. If you're looking for quality Korean food in Arizona, you know as well as I do that it's hard to come by. This establishment was very nice, warm, and comfortable. Ambience is nice with Kpop softly playing in the background. The owner (I'm assuming he was the owner) was very friendly to us. He sat us down quickly and went through the menu with us. We ordered a variety of dishes: bulgogi, pork bulgogi, kimchi pancake, and dol sot bibimbap. All of which were very delicious, but we'll get to that later. This service was very good! Like I said the owner helped us through the menu and even advised I order the dol sot (hot stone) bibimbap due to the cold weather. He brought the food out, cut, and grilled the first bit of meat for us all while making conversation with us. He was genuinely interested in his customers!  The quality if the food was fantastic! Bulgogi was well-marinated and good quality meat. Dol sot bibimbap was excellent, not much you could mess up anyway. Banchan variety was in abundance, but standard stuff. Kimchi pancake was very flavorful, too. If I was still new to Korean Cuisine I would definitely have given this place a 5-star review, but nothing compares to California's edge on Korean BBQ! (In the US, anyway.) I wasn't expecting our meal to be cheap, but I sure wasn't expecting it to be as much as it was. Still, I was very pleased with this find. I haven't had the chance to go back recently, but when I do, I sure hope I leave again fully satisfied."}
{"text":"I visited a few days ago and I had high expectations. I ordered some common Korean fare and it smelled good. However there were so many fruit flies everywhere and they crawled over everything; there were hundreds of them. I finished my soup and boxed up everything and went home. I can't judge the food because the images of those flies are my first impressions of this restaurant. I didn't have any food poisoning so I'll be back to try again; I hope the flies are a one time thing."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this overpriced place. We got some  at table meats to cook, had fun cooking them with owners supervision, and good overall service. The pickled foods at table were good. We love the table cooking when we can afford it, No complaints. Would go back. And they have BEER. The BIG Kirins...."}
{"text":"Not. Good.  Shameful Korean food and side dishes being served up to unsuspecting, nice white folks. Why is the soft tofu soup lukewarm?  Where is the egg?  Where is the stone bowl rice? Why are the side dishes so bad?    I'm ashamed for you, Red Kimchi!"}
{"text":"The staff at this place is great, and the food is even better! My boyfriend got the tofu soup and loved it, while I got the flavor-packed bulgogi. We cleaned our plates and didn't leave a grain of rice behind! The owner is so funny and accommodating, and the servers are so kind. I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I concur with any three-star concurrence. Red kimchi well yeah it was good. It just wasn't great. It's kind a hard to explain since I've been to other Korean restaurants were some of the food is just amazingly flavorful. I got the Bim Bop and it was good, and it came with all the accoutrements. And I love the Korean pickled vegetables, you're so good at it.  The service is very good, at first I thought I was kind of left out being a single diner, However, this is a very family oriented restaurant and apparently the staff was playing with everybody's baby. But, they did come to me and the service was just fine.  The restaurant is clean and he did have his share of customers. Maybe I just wasn't happy with the bim bop."}
{"text":"Decent Korean restaurant. I tried their spicy chicken (so-so), Galbi & tofu stew (both mediocre at best). The restaurant is always empty every time I went there. Service can be rather slow since they don't staff it."}
{"text":"Yes ok, the decor is wanting as others have suggested.  The chef has worked and trained at Okura hotel in Tokyo. His Japanese is even top notch. But i didnt go here for Japanese food.  Bibimpap for me and Tofu seafood soup for my wife.   Food was excellent.   But i would definitley go back, The owner does tons of magical tricks and he is a great entertainer."}
{"text":"What a great little family owned restaurant!  I actually never had authentic Korean food before, and now it's something I'm craving to try more often.  Not only is the food fantastic, but the owner is the bomb.  My friends who eat at Red Kimchi all the time call him \"Hot Stuff.\" I don't know the origin of the nickname, but he happily responds to it.  He's cool as hell, and as we closed the place out, he turned on some Asian hip-hop and took a couple shots with us!  The set up is extremely dated.  It looks straight out of the 80's.  But it doesn't really matter.  Red Kimchi is not designed to be a busy and crowded place.  It's a quiet little spot to enjoy a fantastic meal.  We came with a birthday party of about 15 people.  They were super accommodating, even though we were probably a much bigger group than they're used to entertaining.  One person's order was forgotten, which is always lame, but bound to happen.  It's just the owner and a woman (I'm assuming she's his wife, but I could be wrong).  One big tip when coming here for the first time.  Google maps shows you that Red Kimchi is on Scottsdale and Weber.  Can't tell you why that is, but the place is actually in the Papago Plaza on Scottsdale and McDowell."}
{"text":"The food here is very good but the owner is insulting.  Apparently in Korea it is ok to insult someone.  On two visits the owner came over and poked my stomach and asked when I was due. He considered it a joke to make fun of my spare tire.  I will not enjoy a meal, pay money, and then be insulted.   This owner has been in the US for many years and STILL does not understand American ways.  My wife and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Being Korean I love trying new places. I wasn't impressed with this restaurant though. The kimchi was tasteless and the Bibimbop was more lettuce than anything. The chicken my son got was incredible so I may try this restraunt again. Also the waitress was extra attentive and was pleasant to deal with."}
{"text":"We ordered bibimbap and a few BBQ items along with a variety of boba drinks which were all pretty good. Really friendly and entertaining staff."}
{"text":"Small ass portions. Smaller than a normal person's stomach. One \"From The Grill\" barely can feed two normal sized adults.  Service is slow, especially if you have kids and non Koreans.  Food is surprisingly good but expensive as buffet style.  Repeat: SMALL PORTIONS.  All other reviews failed to mention this."}
{"text":"let me start by saying that two of my best friends (practically my sisters) are korean.  this means that i have a pretty high standard when it comes to korean fare.  i know that i can always count on some good grub when i stop in at thier house and, becuz of that, i have expectations when i walk into a \"korean restaurant\".  one of the officers that i work with said this place was great.  i'm thinkin the army didn't send him to korea.  i ordered the bi bim bop (to go...i hate eating in restaurants by myself) which is a personal fave and is different every place you go.  i have yet to find a place that does it better than my friend's oma, but this place wasn't even CLOSE to my standard.  first off, lemme say that i have never had bi bim bop served with an ASSLOAD of chopped lettuce and some other random green with a totally offputting taste (good for one bite, nauseating after that).  when i initially opened the container holding the bulk of my food i thought the girl had given me the wrong box...wtf, i didn't order a goddamn salad!  *sigh*  after pushing the masses of green shit aside i discovered my beef...what little of it there was to be found.  i felt like mrs. lovett on a quest to find some poor animals dying in the street to bulk up this meal(oh yeah...ally references musicals...get used to it).  it's kinda sad when you eat a big bowl of bi bim bop...of ANYTHING for that matter...and only end up with about five bites with meat.  it was almost like a scavenger hunt...which would be fun, if i wasn't hungry and craving the deliciousness of cow.  overall, my portion size was okay, once i threw out the green nonsense (it has no place being served with this meal) and mixed all of my shit MYSELF.  oh, and btw, korean resaurant, i know i'm white but that doesn't mean that i don't like kimchee...don't skimp on my sides, motherfuckers...it makes me cranky.  two stars for filling me up, even tho it was a total letdown.  *sigh*"}
{"text":"This place is not very good.   The daeji bulgogi is soaked in marinade to the point where you can't find the meat. It's swimming in sauce! When you finally find a piece of pork, it's mostly fat. Yuck.   I prefer Hodori in Mesa. It's a little bit of a drive, but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"I am really digging this restaurant right now. I was stationed in South Korea way back in 2002 and two things I really missed after coming back to the States (specifically Arizona), were Ddeokbokki and Ramyeon. These two food items are as ubiquitous as tacos are here; but they are seldom found in most Korean restaurants in the U.S. since they are considered \"street food\" for the most part. This place has them on the menu! Now, I didn't try the staple Bulgogi, Bibimbap, or Samgyeopsul, so I can't comment on those. But Ddeokbokki! Seriously!?... Awesome. Also, the wait staff seemed nice and there is a cozy atmosphere. I could see myself coming here again with some friends and having a good night out. ."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and always have a good experience. The food is amazing! Kimchi and bulgogi are fresh and highly recommended. The best part, besides the food, is the owner H.S. Every time we go, the soju flows like water and HS has stories for days! Dude is freaking HILARIOUS! Great location and a fun place for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Hidden in a strip mall, looking very much like its also a second hand store. But the waitress, possibly the owner, was super sweet and I loved watching her deliver food to tables with her tiny shuffle steps. The food was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Really delicious food and the waitress was very kind too, even though her English is somewhat lacking. It doesn't matter. The food was very good and when out side dishes were gone, she replaced whichever needed replacing almost instantly.   One small thing that I don't like that much is that the Samgyupsal (Pork Belly) was frozen. Other than that, it's okay.   I recommend this place for people looking for Korean food or is near ASU Tempe and wants Korean food."}
{"text":"This place is hands down my favorite Korean place. I like my space when I eat good food. This space provides that.  Try the military soup -freaking... amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been craving Korean food for awhile, and since there are a dearth of Korean restaurants in Scottsdale, I was excited when I found Red Kim Chi, near my house in South Scottsdale. We stopped in one night right after work, around 5, so it was super quiet; just one other table was seated. I had my personal favorite, bibimbap, in a stone pot. My husband had the bulgogi, and both dishes were very good.  The restaurant itself was pretty basic, no frills, Asian decor.  The service was friendly, and quick.  The prices were a little bit pricey for a very casual Korean restaurant, but not so high as to dissuade me from going back!"}
{"text":"Wretched.  We were excited to find a Korean restaurant relatively close to our house but this was literally the worst Korean food I've ever had.  We ordered Galbi and Samgyeopsal.  The galbi was in a lousy marinade with no flavor.  The pork dish was served as a single solid frozen block of pork loin.  Mmmm.  The meat was mediocre at best but the whole point of Korean BBQ are the \"banchan\" - the side dishes.  The BBQ was served with some lettuce and nothing else.  I asked for pajori and he said he didn't know what I was talking about.     The banchan were pathetic, literally.  Five small dishes of extremely mediocre  crap.  Even the rice was bad, obviously old and reheated.  We ordered buricha to drink.  Even the buricha was lousy!   Basically a tall glass of water with a barely detectable barley flavor.  The real fun came when the bill came.  We were charged $1.95 each for the \"buricha\" and then $2.50 for the lettuce for the BBQ.  I complained to the owner who told me \"we have to make the buricha - we don't keep it!\"  Uhmm... okie dokie.  And charging for lettuce to go with our $35 of BBQ?  Puleez!    If I could give this place 0 stars I would.  Just awful."}
{"text":"Clever name, but that's where it ends. I live very close to this place, so I figured it would be worth checking out. I love good Korean food, but when it's not done well, it sucks. This place is merely serviceable. Our leftovers were very stinky and the food wasn't good. The decor inside was unimpressive, but felt authentic for a hole-in-the-wall. The food isn't horrible, but I can't recommend it.  Papago Plaza has a few gems, but sadly not everything there is awesome."}
{"text":"I was in line for Dutch brothers coffee when I saw the sign for this Korean restaurant. I was excited to try it. I was a bit hesitant at first based on some of the reviews. However, my experience was actually pretty good. I ordered bulgolgi and it was very soft and flavorful. The side dishes they give were good and the server kept them full. When we were finished, we waited for the bill for a while. Because we were waiting so long and couldn't wave anyone down, I had to go up to someone and asked for the bill. That is the reason for the 4 star experience. I am definitely coming back, and I hope to update the review to see what is consistent. Overall, I would still recommend the place to friends."}
{"text":"I would say Red Kimchi deserves a 3 maybe 3.5 rating based on my experience. I was looking for somewhere to take my fiance out for his birthday and stumbled upon this Korean restaurant on Yelp. I called and made a reservation for a table with the tabletop grill. When we got there we found that he had given our table away, although he apologized I was still annoyed and we ended up having to wait another 10 minutes or so (Why even make a reservation?!). Being from California I have been to my share of table top cooking Korean restaurants and they usually have the large rectangular grill that you can put lots of meat on at once. Red Kimchi had a small round grill that seemed to cook unevenly. I asked for a Thai Iced tea and the waiter stated that it wasn't good and I shouldn't order it and I awkwardly said..ummm...ok nevermind. So we order the Galbi short ribs and the spicy Korean pork. The waiter (who I think was the owner) came back with the raw meat and explained that he goes out himself to select the best angus beef for his short ribs. That was a nice little story and the meat was very good quality. I must say the portion was very small for the price paid, $20 for 3 pieces of short ribs. This is not usually the case when I have gone to my Korean BBQ spots in California but this is Arizona and there aren't many Korean restaurants around. The spicy pork was very good and the portion was decent. The restaurants I've been to in the past usually have a lot of kimchi and appetizer sides don't know the proper name) and I was hoping for those cold clear noodles, but it never came. We just got a couple of mediocre pickled items (maybe 3 or 4) and some kimchi lettuce. They did bring out a nice little dessert for his birthday which was yummy. The thing I love the most about going to Korean restaurants with tabletop grills is the fun of cooking it. I didn't get to do any cooking because the waiter popped in every two minutes to snatch the tongs and mess with our food, which is fine if I didn't want to do it. Overall the food was pretty good but maybe ill stick to going to a Hawaiian place for my short rib cravings."}
{"text":"I came in with my family and it was empty which was a bad sign. However, the waitress was very attentive and the food was not only plentiful....but also delicious! Bubble tea is also phenomenal as well. Highly recommended....they are a bit pricey but you get A LOT of food."}
{"text":"Coming from CA, it's hard to find a good Tofu House here in AZ... but here it is!!! The owners don't speak great English but, with the sense of humor the husband Owner has....this place is going to be such a hit!!  Comsamida'!"}
{"text":"Before I begin, I confess that I haven't lived in New York or California as some of the other writers have, thus am not used to the variety of Korean food in those cities. I did, however, live in Seoul and Incheon for quite awhile, so alas that's the closest I can come to gauging how authentic Korean food is. And as I ate Korean food almost daily for a few years, based on my limited experience, I have to say that Red Kimchi is very good.  First, the staff was very nice and attentive, and they were quick about service. I kind of wish I went with more people because there was too much food for me to eat, and they have tteokbokki as an appetizer, which I wanted to order but wasn't hungry enough to eat in addition to my main meal. The bibimbap was delicious and they brought a big bottle of Korean ketchup (or chili sauce) so I could glop on as much as I wanted. I was tempted to get dolsot bibimbap instead, but that will be for next time. Anyway, they put in a generous amount of vegetables and brought six dishes of banchan. I ate as much as I could, but filled up fast. I regret having such a late lunch in retrospect.   Most Korean restaurants in the Valley seem to be in remote areas, and I didn't really want to deal with a 30-minute drive to get to one. The convenience of this place drew me in, and everything else about it will draw me back."}
{"text":"I randomly found this place while in Arizona. I'm from San Diego. I was looking for some soup and I sure did find it.! All the fixins!!"}
{"text":"It may not have a very creative name, but the food is great!  I used to go a lot more but can only go there now if I'm in the area, which is rare.  Located next to Club CBNC, It's a small little place with red velvet booths, and you get the idea that the staff are either all family or close friends.  They're extremely friendly and orders come to the table quickly.  Prices are good for the portions.  I can usually share one plate with another person and still have a bit left over.  You can do a traditional Korean BBQ or just order prepared dishes.  I haven't done the BBQ yet, but I have tried various dishes on the menu and they were all yummy.  My recommendation is the Beef Chop Chae, which is a translucent noodle, slices of beef, scallions, broccoli, carrots, onions, and the traditional Korean sauce.  It is served with a bowl of rice and between 6 to 10 different accompanyments in small bowls ranging from kimchi to a sweet sauteed potato (my favorite...I still haven't figured out what the sauce is).  The items in the small bowls differ depending on what they have on hand.  In the words of Homer Simpson, \"guh-gluglugluhhh\""}
{"text":"My dining companion and I have been here several times over the past few years. The food is consistently good. I usually get the dolsot bibimpap, which is excellent. It comes with six add-ons including kimchi and pickled red onions-delicious! It is a low-key place--you can escape the busy restaurants of Old Town Scottsdale. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Save your money and your time... your taste buds will thank you.  I'll start with the service.  Pretty lousy actually, even for a Korean place.  I had to actually get up and request soybean paste b/c I couldn't wait any longer.  Crappy service.  The side dishes lacked flavor and pizazz.  Totally unimpressed.  The BBQ meat lacked flavor and more importantly, tasted BOILED.  I'm not kidding my first impression was Yoshinoya beef bowl (Cali folks will understand this), seriously.  I saw no physical indication of bbq'ing, nor did it taste like it.... the bottom of the iron dish was filled with liquid like they had just removed it from boiling water.  We also got this specialty rice bowl with beef and veggies was only good when smothered in hot sauce.  Totally unimpressed and will not come back."}
{"text":"Coming from LA and living in AZ for almost 10 years, you just come to the realization that nothing compares to the great array of delicious choices in K Town in LA. But this place is pretty good especially being the only Korean restaurant in South Scottsdale. I came here w couple friends and I started off w my childhood favorite deok bok Ki which is rice cake in red bean paste. I grew up eating this and I was craving it. It didn't disappoint. The rice cakes were cooked perfectly. Soft enough w good texture. That's the key to this dish. I tried the galbi lunch and it was very good. I'm only giving it 3 stars due to the fact that it's a tad over priced and also their side dishes weren't very good. You can tell a really good Korean restaurant from their side dishes especially the kimchi. If you're called Red Kimchi, you would think that the kimchi wouldn't disappoint... well it was pretty bad. But overall, the food was good so will come back again."}
{"text":"Wow!!! I can't believe how great the service is.  I had variety of things here. Sushi was great. The portion is a lot for the price. For Scottsdale, it's the average price but definitely much more portion.  Gamjatang is to die for!!! Side dishes are blend & I was told it's because for health reason...which I agree but does need a little bit more flavor. I can't rave more enough about this place.  I don't know how I never found this place sooner. They also have my favorite drink (Hwayo 23). I will be a regular here for sure. Definitely try the tuna tataki salad for sure if you like good sushi & something healthy."}
{"text":"This is the worst experience I have for Korean food. I'm from the Bay Area, CA and they do not take over an hour to prep all our food.   I went there to have lunch. The restaurant was empty and there werent many people (only about two people in each three tables). We ordered Seafood Pancake, Tofu Soup, and Seafood fried rice. We ordered the pancake for appetizers first and that took a good 30 mins. Seafood pancake shouldn't take that long especially when there weren't that much in the large cake like pancake. Then we waited another 30 mins or more for our other food. While we wait, new customers come in and got their food before us. Either they have their food for lunch prepped or they don't prepare at all, it was not fair to us. The food took so long that we asked for it to go since it passed the 40 mins. Overall it took about an hour and a half wait...  The waittress was sweet but she has some issues with serving and looked nervous. There wasn't a lot of staff and it was very disorganized.   Overall, I don't understand the organization of the service and why it takes so long. The food is decent but service makes up this restaurant not good. I'm not coming back unless their reviews gotten better."}
{"text":"8 of us ate here today in an ethnic lunch MeetUp.  We all concurred food here was not good or authentic.  I have had so much better at other Korean restaurants.  Did not see any REAL Koreans in here, only us Whitey Gringo types.  I could tell the service was not good as soon as I walked in.  My friend who saw me come in, immediately echoed the same, said the \"service was so bad\".  For example, waiter was sitting by our table at the cash register, but it did not occur to him that the two people who walked in later and sat down, also needed water that was already brought to the people who arrived earlier.  I was so thirsty, 102 degrees today, and I had to get him off his barstool to get me glass of water.  But he did not \"notice\" that the lady across from me, also did not have water, and she had to ask for her glass too.  Duhhhh, wake up!  Good service \"anticipates\" and is \"observant\".    But service today is typical of being served by Asian males.  I think the Asian male is used to BEING SERVED by women, and not IN a SERVICE-to-OTHERS position.  So it doesn't occur to his mind to \"observe and anticipate\" and be \"cognizant\", be service-minded\" because he is usually the one SERVED.  I had to ask for take out box.  He was standing at my plate when I asked him, but he brought a tiny square box, and when he was going to put my leftovers in it, he saw it was too small.  But he should have made that assessment when he was standing by my plate, BEFORE wasting a trip to get the smallest box.  That is what I mean, by \"not thinking and observing and noticing and having foresight\".   Have to ask for every little thing.  Food was not tasty or generous, and I tried other people's food too.  Potstickers were not crispy, and made from wonton skins you get from LeeLee's.  I was disappointed this was the first Korean restaurant I've been to in my life, that did not give us the little dishes of kim chee I got with other Korean lunch specials.  I thought the food in the tray was skimpy and price expensive, compared to the Korean restaurants I eat at in San Diego, on Convoy St. , where I got twice the amount of food, 16 different dishes for lunch special, for only $7.99, big pile of spicy marinated pork, twice the portion of that pictured here, that lasts 2-3 meals.  Also included noodles, salad, soup, tempura.  Plus my Convoy Street lunch included 8 little kimchi dishes, you can ask for all you want.  Red Kimchi did not provide any.   Maybe I cannot compare a Korean restaurant in a deserted strip mall (Papago Plaza) in \"Cowboy Country\" with Asian populated San Diego's Asian Restaurant Row - Convoy Street.  And example of \"expensive\", lady across me was charged $3.50 for her cup of hot water and teabag.    We all agreed with the observations and opinions about service and food, that I describe here.  Also restaurant was empty by 1:30 for lunch.  Not coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here, after moving from Long Beach, CA.  I was expecting some good home cooked Korean food.  This place did not have KIMCHI... REALLY...  No Kimchi?  YOUR NAME IS RED KIMCHI!!!  They told me the market price of napa cabbage was too high, so they couldn't make it.  I need to go no further in this review.  It would be a waste of my time, and yours.  I think you get the picture, the rest of the meal was comensurate with the first impression."}
{"text":"I love korean food and this was a poor excuse for it. I got bulgogi and it looked like it was done in a skillet with just some soy sauce. Tasted plain and I didn't even finish it. Never coming back :("}
{"text":"I spent 20 years in Korea, returning to the USA a few years ago. I was really disappointed in this restaurant. The lunch menu was served on a plastic tray with compartments, not Korean style. No banchan, no traditional accompaniments. The American rice had no flavor and was mushy and warm. The fried mandu was not crisp, but limp and dripping in oil. Nothing served tasted ethnic, not even the kimchi, and the service was uneven and surly. Avoid this restaurant. Go to Hodori at Dobson and Southern instead."}
{"text":"Wow!!!! I came here with high hope for delicious Korean food and boy was I let down or what. First off, the place is dead when we walked in. AC wasn't really working very great. We ordered Korean BBQ meat and rib to cook it ourselves on the grill. It's $20 per plate with 2 order minimum. We expect to see lots of it and the portion was so small. Kim chi is not fresh and I didn't end up eating any of it. Then I saw a spider at the top corner of the store.   Service is great. But I sure will never come back here again. It is a big let down for me and I love Korean food."}
