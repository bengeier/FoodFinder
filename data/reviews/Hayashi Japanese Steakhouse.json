{"text":"The best Mahi Mahi I've had yet! I've tried it now all over Arizona, in Hawaii and even in Tahiti where I recently was for my honeymoon. It took them almost the whole time of everybody elses dinners to cook to finish my Mahi, but it was worth the wait. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"They have 2 sides one side is the restaurant and the other is a grill style where they cook the food in front of you. Me and my wife have been to both sides and the restaurant side is not so good but the grill side is great. I recommend the grill side because it's fun and the food is delicious. Make sure to tip the cook. We didn't have cash and I felt bad I didn't tip him."}
{"text":"I will NEVER order or eat here again. For over a year (before all the changes) I ordered the same thing EVERY week to go. So often they could complete my order without me telling them. I call today to order I'm 15 minutes away...they no longer do to go orders. Fine. So i walk in i stand there for 5 minutes while a flock of severs stand and b.s. in the way only servers can do. Then the young man at front desk (who unfortunately got my wrath) finally came out...then he could not even input my order. Then I  try and order my fried rice anf kids meal to go,they wouldnt make the kids meal they dont do them to go. So here i sit 8 months pregnant after working a 10 hour day waiting for them to make my order. NEVER AGAIN.  To bad they just lost MULTIPLE birthday parties from our family which were always minimum  $350.00 checks and all the to go orders of $25.00."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people are giving this place 1 and 2 star reviews. I read their reviews and they mostly say the sushi is good, the service is good, but I'm gonna give it 1 star because it was $55 for sushi. Are you kidding me?  Sushi is NOT cheap, and if you eat cheap sushi you're probably gonna get sick!  I went to this place on a Sunday, was greeted and seated right away, was promptly brought drinks, soup and salad by a friendly waitress, and enjoyed a good show from the hibachi chef. I also ordered some sushi rolls which were brought to the table in a reasonable amount of time and tasted awesome!  Just because you had one bad experience or you ordered a sushi roll you didn't like or it was too expensive doesn't mean you should give a place one star!  Also this place is kinda new and it always takes restaurants awhile to get things running smoothly. We should support these individually owned restaurants so we can have more of them here and more choices and better food  That's why the food back east is so much better than out here in Phoenix because of the independent operators; instead we get the same ol big chains out here and it's about time we had a change of pace. And to the person that even mentioned McDonalds in his review, shame on you!  Go watch Supersize Me and you'll be glad you paid $55 for some healthy, quality food!  2 Big Macs for $3 = heart attack and a huge doctor bill! So you'll be payin' in the long run."}
{"text":"I used to go here daily. They had an amazing lunch special and their rolls were full of FLAVOR! The food isn't terrible. The staff is not too bad, except for some blond with short hair in their older woman, OMG she was so freaking rude... anyways I haven't been back since I went to dine in with a group of friends. No more lunch specials, they changed how rolls were made so they aren't as flavorful anymore. They raised the prices, what are they trying to do go out of business? I am mainly upset that they ruined the sushi rolls and no more lunch specials. I wish I knew where the old owners and cooks went so I could go there for my sushi. for now I go to Safeway because it tastes better. Their pricier rolls that they jacked the price up on of course have more flavor but I don't want to spend half my paycheck on one meal kthnx. Unless they fix their restaurant I will not be back, nor have any of my friends gone back either, that's over 20 customers they lost."}
{"text":"My family and I like Hayashi and try to visit when we're in town (we do the sushi part), but the past several times have been awful: poor service. We made a reservation, but had to wait a few minutes before we were seated and once we were seated we were not served! There was a family that arrived quite a few minutes after us that were helped before us and once we saw that, we left - we had been seated for 15 minutes! My father went to tell the manager, but his only comment was: \"you must have been overlooked.\" That's it - no sorry, nothing. I agree with the other reviewers, the food isn't worth putting up with the horrendous service."}
{"text":"Sushi is ok here. The hibachi is fun too watch but I'm always hungry afterwards.. I love to eat and it's really expensive to get full here.  Kid meals are expensive!  Beware... Felt stupid paying 8$ for a kid's meal for dinner when it was just \"ok\".."}
{"text":"Tried to go to Hayashi in Surprise today, and sign on the door says they are permanently closed :( 
Thankful Goodyear location is still open at least. Love their rolls."}
{"text":"New owners kinda ruined the place.  Management's a shit show. However sushi chefs are great.  Staff um well  I've had better service when burger king did table service in the 90's.  Bartenders (ladies in years past) were great .  the old bartender was spot on these new ones are maybe ok for a low volume place but add more then 7 customers and you are gonna suffer.  Have not been back in since transition to new owner last week's visit just sucked ...sucked sucked and owner or manager yelling is just stupid...  I won't be back was very uncomfortable seeing a manager or owner for some idiot yelling in front of customers ..shows lacking management skills - quality of food was ok but not what it was before.. Its all SYSCO or bulk processed hospital like these days... Sad ...  Btw smells like a sewer at the bar. .. And bathroom is gang tagged With graffiti and no soap..  Not the place it was before .. I'm gonna go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Dropped in late one night. Both the hostess and waitress were quick to let us know that waiting a few extra minutes would allow us to order from the \"reverse happy hour\" menu. The wait was worth it! Great prices on appetizers (shumai were delicious), rolls (the one with mango was our favorite) and beer and saki.."}
{"text":"Was there about a month  ago, food was good and the Chef's  were  great. Gave over a 20% tip on my bill to only find out they took it out again! ! Look at my bank statement  and found the total charges  with tip and another charge for additional  tip.Beware of you credit transaction s..I won't be back do not trust them with my credit card! !"}
{"text":"I've patronized Hayashi for lunch(weekday) and dinner(weekend) half-a-dozen times and sat at the bar or in a booth. I am there for the rolls and and not much else.

There are numerous roll selections. Almost too many for my taste.  The rolls are good, although I usually stay away from any cream cheese contained rolls.  The fish tastes fresh. The eel can be too dry. The \"white\" fish used in some rolls tends to be very dry when served tempura style. My favourite roll is the Volcano roll: Spicy tuna piled on top of rolls. Seattle roll is good too.

As far as price, don't kid yourself. $50/person is pretty average. That's 3-4 rolls and two drinks.  Yes, they are $2-$3 more than I'd like them to be but considering the available choices: acceptable.

The place is very busy on the weekends. I've had lunch during the weekday. It provides a great opportunity to ask the sushi chef questions about what is in the rolls and watch them make it. Considering the small size of their sushi bar and regular bar, service isn't too bad. I've been told there are plans to construct a larger sushi bar. That's good new for customers.

Dave at the bar provides great service. Haley is a work horse. Smile more Haley!!! I've only sat at Pua's tables and have nothing but good things to say about her service and roll recommendations.

The one glaring deficiency is the lack of customer service from management. Roam the floor, greet the customers, ask about the service and food, offer advice to those undecided on what to order. How about having samples to help entice those who are totally lost.

Connect with the customers and we will come back for more."}
{"text":"So sad when I found out Hayashi had closed down ! My favorite chef was JESSE but I've done my search and found out (stocker lol he cooked for us so much we where friends) he is now working at AS-HO IN GOOD YEAR (Estrella and McDowell) so I'm a happy camper now. Their food is really good too!"}
{"text":"Always will be my favorite restaurant of all time. Very delicious sushi for very good prices. I cried when I found out it closed because it also happened to be where I met my fiance. The Hayashi in Surprise, we miss you!!!"}
{"text":"Very good fried rice, I recommend getting it. My Aunt Suzi said it was the greatest she ever had!! A little slow on the drinks though. Definitely go!!!"}
{"text":"For sushi - not really impressed. Would rather get rolls from a grocery store like AJ's over this place (they are better, too). The sushi bar is not really meant to be sat at here. The sushi chefs do not interact with the customers sitting in front of them. A wait person takes sushi orders and hands it to the chef. There is a lot of waiting (and watching for wait staff) involved, probably because the wait staff have tables. The wait staff I interacted with were nice. I think the rolls were overpriced. I can't really recommend. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I love Hayashi have been going bimonthly for years!  I went today and the food was awful they have a new policy that won't allow them to cook on the grill if you have an allergy which is BS.  I have been going so long and can't digest onion its  a shity allergy but it just means they don't cook my food with it being cooked near it does not affect me.  So for sake of an argument over this new policy they cooked my food in the kitchen which I was against adamantly... When I got my food the rice was bland and its not like they put salt and pepper shakers out I wasn't offered soy sauce because god knows they needed it and there was no garlic..it was just egg and rice, so rice fail...I ordered the steak medium rare ....I have had jerky with more flavor then the crap I got it tasted smokey burnt and was no where near med rare.  the waitress was nonchalance to my complaint and honestly could give too shits.  She forced a gratuity on our check because we were a party of 6..  3 of which were MY children.. 1 of which didnt even eat at the grill he had ordered sushi only.  I feel they are falling behind and just being lazy in preparation and services.  I understand that you have to have no race specific chefs but when its Hispanic cooking Japanese food know how to do it!!! My husbands food was drowning in garlic the guy just kept piling it on way more then we have ever seen used before!  They lost a valuable loyal family as a customer today I won't be going back my money can better be spent at the hibachi cooking fast food places in the mall!"}
{"text":"Great food.  Large portions.  Always fresh and amazing pricing!  We usually come for lunch during the week and dinner on weekends and they have always brought the food out quick.  With a busy work schedule and short time for lunch it is a smart choice."}
{"text":"Went to the Avondale location to pick up take out sushi and had the misfortune of encountering the new owners who don't seem to care as much for customer loyalty or service as much as the previous ones did. Picked up 6 orders of sushi 15 minutes after their lunch special ended and they refused to honor the lunch special prices. Ended up paying $45 for what would have been $25 sushi. Then, to add insult to injury, we got home and sat down to old, dry, fishy smelling sushi. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a few weeks ago and we were not impressed to say the least.. The hostess was rude and ignored me when I asked her a question about the menu. After we were seated, our waitress was pretty friendly and brought out our soup fairly quickly. However, she came back to check on us and started to take our bowls away while we were still eating. She apologized but we told her to take them anyway because it was pretty awkward. Then she forgot half of our order and I cant understand why. They were completely dead with maybe one or two other tables and another waitress! The food was ok, nothing special. But I probably wouldn't come back. They kind of ruined our experience..."}
{"text":"Hayashi sushi has gone downhill since the last time we ate there.
I should have known to go somewhere else as soon as I walked to their front door.  Deferred maintance with a leaking faucet, dirty front doors, messy sidewalk, etc.
We will be seeking out a new place for sushi."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife about 4 months ago desiring some sushi. So note that this review is only for the sushi and not the tepanyaki tables. We ordered a boat of sushi to share since we were celebrating and expected the typical sushi accompaniments. When the sushi arrived there was no soy sauce and no wasabi. When we asked for these, they said they didn't have them. About 10 minutes into our meal a busboy came to our table with packets of soy sauce but still no wasabi. The rice was very bland. It had very little to 0 of the typical \"Sushi Rice\" flavor. The fish was average at best. So in total we spent $60 on sushi for two and got bland unflavored rice with \"OK\" fish and soy sauce packets and no wasabi. I would definitely not recommend this location and would not return for sushi."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here Friday night at 7pm for dinner in the teppanyaki room.  We called on Thursday to make reservations and were told by the hostess they don't accept reservations for small parties but it should be no problem to be seated at a table with another group.  Upon our arrival Friday, excited and hungry, the hostess notified us of a ONE HOUR WAIT TIME.  We were offered a table in the sushi area but declined the offer because we were there for the teppanyaki dining experience.  We quickly left and went to a different Teppanyaki restaurant in Peoria where I was eating my main course within 45 minutes of exiting Hayashi.  We live nearby and  very excited to see this restaurant open in Surprise, but our family won't be returning."}
{"text":"SO DISAPPOINTED!  I had been a regular at this restaurant because of the delicious food and the servers.  I went back today after a couple months away to find that they have changed owners, changed personnel, and CHANGED THEIR FOOD!  First of all, the took the professional looking menus and changed them into printed ones with spelling mistakes.  Then, they raised the prices.  The food was not as flavorful and did not have the same taste.  They got rid of my favorite mustard sauce and replaced it with shrimp sauce...not nearly as good.  Service was S..L..O..W..I almost got up and left.  The server was nice enough, but new and didn't know much..I didn't see any of the servers that used to be there.  The only plus is that they now have happy hour until 10pm throughout the restaurant...
For the cost and the raised prices, I can definitely do better.  And that makes me sad."}
{"text":"Looked like a nice place to have a late lunch.  Can not rate the food because we never got waited on.  Only a few customers in the place. We were sitting at the first table next to the Hostess. Left after 10 minutes."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely horrible when it comes to service. The food is okay. I sat down with two.other friends and waited over 30 minutes for our drinks. We finally order and my friend didnt like her sushi so she ordered a terriyaki bowl instead.. It took over 40 minutes for her to get her food, our sushi got all gross because obviously were not going to eat in front of her obivously. The waitress came back with the bowl and said.\"im sorry the kitchen got backed up\" the grill side was already closed down. She was reLly rude never apologized just blamed it on the kitchen. At. One point i had to walk to the front to get a hostess to get our waitress because i was thirsty as hell and she was no where to be seen for another 30 minutes. I will never go back here. Worst service i have had."}
{"text":"yummy! the sushi is great.. i also had the steak and shrimp from my boyfriends plate.. that was yummy too! they don't have a good happy hour or else id give it 5 stars.. :("}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple times in the past with friends, and I must say, this place has really amazing sushi! There's a certain waiter that we'd always get helped by who remembers us and is a real cool guy! We once waited a few hours for the happy hour specials upon arriving early, and he was very accomodating and friendly. This place is a real hotspot in Surprise and definitely should not be missed."}
{"text":"Really happy with the food. We were visiting family around the Surprise area and went for my friends birthday dinner. We were very happy with the food. We all did the grill and I had a little bit of sushi. I was impressed with both. Only problem was we called to reserve a table and they said they had a min. of 6 to make a reservation...but that we should be okay to just come in. We got in and they told us we could wait at the bar. The happy hour looked nice but we just got a few drinks and an app. Then when they finally said they could seat us... they  made us wait a little longer at the grill table to \"see if anyone else shows up\" to sit next to us. No one did so it seamed to be a waist of everyone's time to wait so long.  The food was really great just wish they wouldn't have made us wait for an hour (or let us reserve a table when we call the day before). Overall I would go again and I would like to try more of their sushi."}
{"text":"I went there with my family and we all had a great time. The cook who made the food in front of us was hilarious while he was cooking it. I can see people getting offended but not me personally. The food ended up tasting delicious."}
{"text":"First let me preference this review by saying that I contacted Hayashi (via email) the day after the last incident happened and they have not responded to me, which is unfortunate.

Our first visit to Hayashi was when they first opened and it ended with us leaving before we were even seated due to the fact that there was such confusion with the hostesses.  We went back a few weeks later and it seems as if there was still a cloud of confusion lingering.

 We told the hostess we would like to sit in the bar for happy hour and we asked her if we could sit anywhere in the bar and she said yes and seated us in a booth.  After sitting there and being ignored for quite awhile my husband went and asked the hostess if there was a server available.  Soon after our waiter came to the table and we asked about the happy hour specials which he started to recite.  We asked if there was a menu available for the happy hour and he returned with a photo copy of a menu.  We ordered a couple of martinis and some sushi.  At least 10 minutes had passed and considering the fact that there were only four people sitting at the bar and another booth of customers the wait seemed excessive.  Finally our waiter showed up without drinks or food and told us that we had to be physically sitting at the bar to have the happy hour pricing... seriously?!  

So after almost 30 minutes of being in the restaurant we don't have drinks or food and we are told we now have to move to the bar, which we did.  The bartender seemed occupied with cutting, cleaning and talking with a couple of girls that she didn't even notice we were there.  We got her attention and she asked us what we wanted.  We asked her if the waiter transferred over our order from the booth and were told no, he did not.  So again we order.

After all of this we were ready to leave but we were hungry and needed a drink!  Thankfully the sushi chef was good, as was the sushi.  The drinks were just \"ok\" and again, the vibe was just lame.  That coupled with the lack of responsibility on the part of Hayashi to respond to my initial complaint is disappointing.  I really doubt if we'll go back."}
{"text":"Service is terrible if you are served by the guy in the bar named Phoenix. He is actually the only guy that works the bar. He brought me the wrong roll so I told him what I had ordered. He argued with me on what I ordered and I didn't want to ruin my appetite do I told him take the plate I can't eat that and please bring me what I ordered. He took it and was a jerk afterwards with smart responses. I asked him for the bill he didn't say one word but took his time bringing it. He charged me for both rolls the one I sent back and the one I ordered. It was already a bad experience I paid for both and left. Didn't even say thank you when he took my bill. He should consider a different career. As long as he works there I won't return and will let everyone know."}
{"text":"The food was good, our griller was nice, but did seem a little inexperienced. Our waitress was nice, but took forever when it came to refilling our drinks, getting our bill, and had even forgot to give my husbands card back so he had to go back the next day to retrieve it! As if that wasn't bad enough she dropped a fork in sauce when reaching to pack up our food and she splattered sauce all over my husband.

With us we had our two kids as well, and they thought the food was great, but later when we got home, we all got soooo sick, my poor daughter even had to stay home from school the next day. Had to throw out all our $20 an average plate food, what a waste!

Then to top it off, the bathrooms! Both the men's and women's bathrooms were awful!!! I would have rather used a port-a-potty! I don't even want to go in to details they were that bad!!!

This was our second time there, the first was a decent experience, but this last experienced has left my family and I scarred!!! We are bummed because we love these types of grills, but we will not be returning to this specific one again."}
{"text":"Wife and I really like surprise location and have eaten there many times, however it has been getting more and more filthy. They have a young staff working there who have obviously not been getting any leadership direction and as a result the bar area and men's rooms are deplorable. The menu's, tables,seats and floor in the bar area were sticky. There was debree on the floors, men's room was ugly, faucet was pulled out of the sink and just laying there, urine everywhere, hadn't been mopped in a very long time, smelled etc. carvings on the drywall. I'll leave the rest to your imagination. Although the food was good, my thinking is if the dirt is this obvious....then what about the kitchen where my food is being prepped and also where there is dirt there is vermin, we won't be going back to this location again and will shop the competition. Just my opinion"}
{"text":"First the good our waitress was very courteous. The atmosphere was far to dark for day time dinning, but I can see it being much more enjoyable during the evening. The miso soup was god awful as it was clearly old. I ordered the lunch sushi and sashimi. the fish was not fresh  and the chefs knife skills were off. It was cut way thick. IF YOU WANT GOOD FRESH SUSHI GO TO FRESH WASABI DOWN THE ROAD. Also ordered the chicken tempura roll which was just OK. If your looking for good Sushi stay clear."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! We always sit at the sushi bar and Paul prepares our sushi. He is a gem! Awesome customer service, he remembers everything about us every time we come and he always creates dishes for us on the spot based on our preferences."}
{"text":"New owner terrible service the sushi was good. Not sure what happened to this place."}
{"text":"The sushi was very good and prices are fair. 

Just the service is mediocre - I waited 15 minutes before server noticed I hadn't been helped and it took 45 minutes until I had a small sushi combo."}
{"text":"Mon-Fri 12:00-3:00 they have lunch specials that are amazing. I'm talking full on hibachi, cooked in front of you, large portions for like $10 a person. 

They also have a sushi deal that is (from a selective menu) three rolls for $10. 

This place at lunch time is just too good to pass up. 

Food is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. Never a good experience. I will not return. 


Disappointing is an understatement as to our last experience. The entire meal was slow- from drinks and refills to food service time to payment. We each ordered a meal, and we ordered an order of Tempura California rolls. It took over 30 minutes for our food to arrive, and the California rolls did not even come until after the meal was served. 

 Our waitress was not attentive and several other servers had to come to refill drinks as they would be empty for periods of time before anyone stopped by. The food was ok, but highly salted. At the end part of our meal, we asked for a side of eel sauce for our rolls. The waitress attempted to get a side from the sushi bar- during our meal, we sat very near the sushi bar and could watch/hear what was going on. The head sushi chef told her NO, he would not give her eel sauce. we waited about 5 minutes before she went back to the sushi bar and asked him again for the eel sauce. At this point, he began yelling at her, loud enough to where we could clearly hear what he was saying, telling her no, go get it from the kitchen herself, that its her job, not his to wait on the tables and get stuff, and was pointing directly at our table. Another server heard what was going on and went over, and again he was yelling and pointing at our table making remarks about getting stuff for us. we were completely done with our food before the side of sauce even arrived, and we felt like we had inconvenienced the entire staff by asking for a small side of sauce.

 We then got the check and placed cash in the folder. I noted the time since everything had been so slow- and it was 27 minutes before the waitress returned with our change. During the half hour we waited for change, we heard and saw the same sushi chef snap at several other servers, as well as a customer! There were place settings around the sushi bar, and when a customer sat down, he informed him - \"were not serving here- were too busy, you have to go away- go over there.\" and pointed him away. 

 This was an almost 2 hour dinner for only 2 people, with a background of rude employees. 

 What a horrible experience for a $70 dinner."}
{"text":"Our first trip to Hayashi was right after they opened in Surprise and it was fantastic; after that, it has been awful. We have gone back three times since our first visit and each time our experience was worse than the one before. The restaurant itself is filthy-- rice on the floor, tables seem to have been wiped down with every other guest. The food itself is usually slow getting to the table and not always hot. Servers are hit and miss at best-- most don't understand the concept of staying in touch with their tables which means drink refills, etc. are usually ignored unless you flag another employee down. The hostesses act like they are being imposed upon when you enter the restaurant giving you a condescending \"follow-me\" look. Then they throw the menus down on the table and mumble something about someone coming to take our order--I'm guessing because they are usually three steps away from the table when they mumble; I'm not even sure they are speaking to you in English-- could be Mandarin for all I know."}
{"text":"You guys shouldn't have gotten apart of ah so's your food quantities are less now. And the food is just trash now. Your menu looks like a 5 year old made it and you disappoint me I would close down if I were you."}
{"text":"Terrible sushi. Couldn't finish it at all. Ordered quail egg, sweet shrimp, spicy tuna roll and a salmon skin hand roll. When the chef gave my server the shrimp heads to deep fried he went and showed people and his co worker how it looked and how weird it was before bringing to the back. When my order came out I was given tamago instead of quail egg and told him I thought it was wrong. The server said that he asked the chef and he said it was quail egg. I once again said it wasn't quail egg and they corrected it for me. The decor was dark and depressing. I will never go back again"}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant with a large group on what appeared to be a busy night.  Would later find out it was due to unprepared staff and primarily management.  The service was dismal, drinks took 30 minutes to arrive, the chef arrived before soup and drinks were delivered to table, and honestly the food was not good.  When going to the bar to get drinks, I was ignored by bartenders and also the manager.  Poor service, poor quality and expensive food equals a waist of time, money, and patience.  I would avoid this place and go someplace else if you are looking for Japanese dining."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure the bar had a foul smell possibly coming from the sinks drain? As the water is straight up horrible.  And the front door seems like it wants to fall off. 
Great concept. Good sushi.  But all those other issues have me questioning the place.  
I would much rather go to fresh wasabi for sushi."}
{"text":"I found this place on my birthday, and have been a loyal fan ever since!  Everything at Hayashi has always been top notch!  I've eaten in the bar, sushi bar, and habachi, and have never ever been disappointed.  David the Bartender is the man.  If you ask him to make his signature cocktail, he will ask you what types of spirits you prefer, and just get creative from there.  At the Litchfield Park location, our favorite sushi chef is H.  Yes, he is so badass, that he can go by the name of just H.  His attention to detail makes the dining experience so much better....no loose rolls!  And then there is the Habachi area:  Outstanding!  Each chef brings their own unique personality to the grill, and we have had a blast with each of them.  And ofcourse, the food was excellent!  Always a great experience @ Hayashi!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to Hayashi Japanese Steakhouse for happy hour. It's always good food and a good time. We sit at the bar and get a couple of glasses of the house Cabernet and share a bunch of appetizers. It's like Japanese Tapas. Makes for a great dinner.

Last time we got the Japanese Chicken Nuggets, Yakatori, and S&B. The Chicken Nuggets are basically just deep fried marinated chicken served with tangy sweet dipping sauce. Probably pretty unhealthy, but definitely delicious. Yakatori is broiled chicken and onion on skewers served with tempura. Also delicious. S&B is broiled shrimp and bacon served with teriyaki sauce. All three were great. The chicken nuggets were so good that we ordered another round! 

If you want a nice sit-down meal, try their hibachi dinner on the other side of the restaurant. They have veggies, chicken, salmon, shrimp, steak, scallops, filet mignon, and lobster tail. I've tried the chicken, shrimp, steak, and filet mignon, and they're all fabulous. You get soup, salad, white or fried rice, and plenty of yummy dipping sauces. It's plenty of good quality food for a reasonable price. Plus it's fun to bring family and friends. The hibachi chef always puts on a good show. I love the onion ring volcano. Nifty trick, that.

I highly recommend Hayashi for your next special occasion or just a casual, relaxing happy hour. In fact, I might have to go there tonight!"}
{"text":"Dinner was good....service was ok. I am willing to give it a second chance in hopes that the folks were just off last night. We saw our waitress 3 times and while she was nice enough....waiting for everything got to be more than frustrating. A bit pricey but if its the name you're paying for.....I guess.
Simply put...they MIGHT get one more chance to impress me. But right now.....I'm not even close."}
{"text":"They also own the Ah So on 61st and Bell, always a great experience, and they now have what my wife and sister-in-law call yum yum sauce, also known as shrimp sauce. They are always willing to accommodate my wife's pickiness! She loves the shrimp tempura roll, but doesn't like crab, so they always gladly take it out. Understandably, they no longer take phone orders because some ass kept calling and ordering $300 worth of food and then not picking it up."}
{"text":"I wanted authentic Japanese steakhouse walked in and it was Mexican restaurant. Nothing is sacred."}
{"text":"What has happened to this place?? Brought my entire family here a little over a month ago for a very special occasion and it was a disaster.Waiter spilled water everywhere which would have been forgivable if he'd come back one time during our ENTIRE meal to refill any of our drinks. As we watched him chat away with his buddy we sat there trying to swollow our food that wasn't even our order without any drinks at all. Towards the very end of our meal our chef apologized as he listened to the server make excuses for never returning to our table to take a dirty plate or refill our beverages. At this point we paid and I told the host what had happened and he not only didn't apologize he didn't get a manager or speak a word. We lost out on a great memory of a special occasion and the restaurant lost out in a $100 bar tab due to the awful service. This is one of many bad experiences I've had here over the last few months but this was the icing on the cake.  This place needs a house cleaning!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the food was the same.  Being Japanese I have to say that this was a horrible disappointment.  I was looking forward to good food and received \"americanized dishes. They seem to cater to the large groups and ignore the others.  Birthday parties seem to get the royal treatment, we felt like joining their party just to get some service.  Never again, live and learn"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! My boyfriend and I were seated right away. Our waiter, Ned, was absolutely wonderful and quick with getting our drinks and orders. It was quite a busy night, so as expected, there was a small wait for the chef to come to our table, but once he was here, the entertainment was on!
Tonight, my boyfriend got the chicken and steak, which he loved! It was so much food that he couldn't finish it all and had to bring some home. I opted for the sushi....spicy tuna and Las Vegas rolls, both delicious!!
I can't wait to come here with additional family and friends and have them experience the wonderful ambiance, service, and food! This place is a true gem!"}
{"text":"I would like to give this location a BIG FAT ZERO!! We waited for over an hour and our food NEVER came.  The waitress never came back to the table. We stopped at the hostesses stand on our wait and asked for a manager. She said she couldn't help us because they didn't really have a lunch time manager. Needless to say the Chik Fil A down Bell was DELICIOUS!!!! Maybe because I was STARVING! I will NEVER go to this location again."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place since they opened and just got around to it last night.  Before I begin, I will have to say that my rating has nothing to do with food or drinks because we never got the chance to order.  

No marking for entrance, sticky floors and VERY dark and dingy.  We sat on the restaurant side.  It was a Monday night so very quiet and only 4 other people in the place when we got there.  Dude at the bar was cursing so loud. (Nothing to do with the restaurant) The waitress did stop by and say she'd be right with us.  We are patient people...we waited 15 minutes and decided to leave.  Personally I think that is ample time to at least bring waters or take our drink orders.  

We won't be \"trying\" this place again. 

I was bummed :("}
{"text":"I eat here almost every Sunday for their amazing sushi. Great food, great prices, great sushi chefs."}
{"text":"Good and mediocre both!  GOOD: the scallops were morsels of buttery deliciousness.  We were seated promptly.  The grilled veggies were excellent. The steak was also good. MEDIOCRE: say yes to the fried rice cause they won't bring your steamed rice till everyone is done eating.  Don't order chicken because it won't be done till everyone else has eaten their entrees   They give you forks not chopsticks  and no shrimp grilled as appetizers like as Benihanas"}
{"text":"I love the new owners! They are really nice. The first couple times we came in it was a little rocky but that was because they had a whole bunch of brand new employees. We even had our waiter walk out on our table half way through dinner...the main reason we can back was because the owners were so nice and the food was still delicious. We have been back three times now and it gets better and better! We even have a favorite hibachi chef his name is Jessie. He cooks everything on point and to your liking plus he delivers a great show. My husband and I recently tried one of the sushi rolls *time square roll* and it was amazing. I am very happy to have found a hibachi restaurant close to my house."}
{"text":"12 of us sat around a large hibatchi grill, of which they have 4...or was it 6?  I forgot it was called hibatchi until I read another review.  If you don't really care about japanese words except \"sushi\" and \"tsunami\" like me, then hibatchi is one of those big flat circular grills where a dude with some sharp knife cooks and serves your food.  Our cook had skills, as good as any I've seen.  All the typical toss accuracy tricks with a few twists. 

AWESOME: If one of us didn't order something that was being cooked, the cook would toss a little on your plate.  A lot of us shared food, and THIS ACTION CUT DOWN ON COST.

Yes, hibatchi experiences are going to always cost a little more.  And sushi is always going to cost on the high end of protein foods.  At Hayashi's, you are paying partly for experience.  For family/group fun, use the hibatchi side.  For more intimate times such as dates or business meetings, use the sushi bar side and get your buzz on.  

The cooked food was better than the sushi.  I feel I was able to dissociate between the two styles, and I am a massive sushi fan.  THE SUSHI WAS AVERAGE.  Slightly better than what you might get in the fresh foods area of a grocery store.  HOWEVER, \"STEAKHOUSE\" is in the name of the restaurant.  The precedence is the hibatchi side.  The sushi is a nice quarterback option hand-off fullback.

If I just want average sushi I'll pick some up from Sprouts, crack a beer, boxers on couch.

If I want an experience, where people serve me and cook for me, and I'm not on a tight budget, then Hayashi's cool.  

The place is nice, new, classy, and clean.  Lots of room, perfect lighting, and pleasant background noise.  I HAVE ZERO COMPLAINTS, AND NEITHER DID THE GROUP I WAS WITH.

If you're from the Surprise area, check it out on a special occasion.  if you're on business, check it out; worth a few extra dollars and what do you care on business expense. 

I'm A-Ok with this place.  I plan to eat there about once a year.  If I've been there a time or 2 more and have the same experience, then 4 stars."}
{"text":"While in AZ on vacation, my father in law brought us here. I had never been to a Japanese restaurant but was pleasantly surprised at how great the food was. We had \"Daniel\" as our cook. He was funny and entertaining. All of us ordered different things, steak, lobster, chicken, salmon. No issues with the food at all- It has since become one of my fondest memories of my father in law."}
{"text":"New owners took over-- sushi went downhill-- hibachi grills are same good food. But I do not recommend their sushi"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and entertaining, got to see our meal made in front of us, excellent food and service was okay, not great service but okay. Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusted with this place, we used to enjoy taking family and guests here with us, this last time however our cook was so in appropriate. All kinds of sexual comments in front of our kids 8 and 11, and the things he kept saying to my mother in law were beyond appropriate, I honestly almost punched him in the face! We were very upset, talked to the server about it who said he would let management know as he saw the same things we experienced, my wife even called the next day to complain to which their response was appologetic and acted like they would do something about it, they offered us a gift card, but yet never sent it.  Doesn't matter anyways we WILL not go back, but seriously? IF you say your doing something about it, then do it, if you say your sending something, then do it. Avoid this place at all costs.  If this was the last place on earth to eat I would starve to death because I WILL NEVER BE BACK!"}
{"text":"Disgusting!  This place used to be good. Went there for my birthday a couple weeks ago and left in tears. It was so disgusting and after a year of not eating sushi due to pregnancy I was so excited. The food was nasty. The eel roll was awful and didn't even come with eel sauce and it was so dirty there that I didn't even want to eat. Don't even step foot in the door. If you do, you will regret it."}
{"text":"This review is pretty overdue - time flies eh? But all I can really say is Ick - no. I was in town and staying with my Mom and she was pretty excited to take myself and some other lingering family members here for dinner. Having been a frequent Benihana-er in the past I feel my expectations were pretty high. 

The service itself was okay - but our cook - he was SO wrong. I'm sure he's just trying to make everyone laugh but he was making sexual noises and \"oh yeah baby's\" while \"beating the meat\" or whatever it was he was making. I was there with my Mom and her husband, but even if it was just friends of mine? Ew...no. So disturbing. Older Asian guy \"making love\" with and to my food does NOT equal appetizing in my world. 

Not only that - but the fried rice was a disaster. I live for fried rice - and it was almost non edible. Who puts garlic in their fried rice? Well, sure, these guys do. Not just a hint - like a mouthful of \"HEY I JUST ATE LOTS OF GARLIC\" amounts of garlic. I had the Salmon as well - which was tasty overall but it was so over-salted/peppered that I found myself choking on it until I eventually gave up. 

Sorry to say - none of us will be back here. Not cool guys - just - not cool."}
{"text":"Happy Hour is great! There are two, one from 5-7 and the other is 8-close. We like the later one since that is when the rolls go on special.  Biggest drawback is that they are so busy and usually only have one person working the whole bar area. I always feel bad bc she is so swamped!  Which means that you are normally there at least an hour for some sake and rolls. But despite that we enjoy ourselves every time."}
{"text":"I'm going to have to partially agree with Debra O, and I can guarantee you I do NOT work at a competing restaurant. And you freakin well BETTER \"believe my review\". The prices are very expensive here. Our total bill for two people and one three year old came to $54. That's with a simple chicken and steak dish for me ($22), a hibachi vegetables with chicken on the side for the wife and a noodles and chicken for the kid. No sushi. Inside, the place is okay - although they took us to the back room (we opted for the sushi side rather than the hibachi side) which was very cramped - even without it being particularly full we still had to move chairs out of the way in order to scoot through to our table. The food was okay - I've had better. I would have gone for a little nigiri or sushi rolls had I not been put off by the price - a SINGLE piece of yellowtail nigiri for $2.50? Pfft. The rainbow roll wasn't the common one with shrimp, yellowtail etc, which I ALWAYS get - instead the picture showed it with different colored fish roe instead. Pass. Didn't look like they had spicy crab roll either. Already, Fresh Wasabi was ahead IMO. The kid's dish was adult-sized, far more than a three year old could hope to eat unless they're a Ricki Lake special. My kid is not.

The highlight was the server. He was very attentive, friendly and helpful - returned several times, always kept the glasses filled, had a couple of menu recommendations, offered to help by looking up deals at the counter for the chicken/veg combo the wife ordered to see if he could punch in a better deal (which didn't happen, but whatever), and even boxed our takeout for us. Then again, doubling the tax got him a hefty ten buck tip so.. (shrug)

Won't be going back, I'm afraid. Simply because this is apparently the only teppanyaki restaurant in Surprise doesn't immediately convince me that I need to gush over how awesome it is. That Greek place down on Reems that died and got replaced by Nick's Diner was awesome. Ritters was awesome. Babbo's spaghetti and meatballs special is awesome. This place is meh, bordering on bad value for money especially in this shitburger economy where even McDonalds is now offering two big macs for $3. You can feed two people for $3 and I fed three tonight for almost $55. Seriously, I tried my hand at Gordon Ramsay's smoked paprika chicken stroganoff recipe a couple of nights ago (although I substituted pork loin strips for chicken and roasted poblanos for green peppers), and not only were the ingredients half the price of my meal tonight but what I made was twice as delicious. When I go to a restaurant I'm after food that tastes BETTER than my own cooking yeah. Snort. Bring back El Paso!"}
{"text":"I was referred to this place by a coworker, so my family and I decided to do a birthday dinner here. It was fantastic! A very clean environment, our wait wasn't that bad and the staff was very friendly. When we sat down our waitress was excellent and kept my drinks topped off even though I didn't ask which was a big plus for me( that is a \"tip\" changer! ) when our chef (Daniel) got there he was super pumped, it seemed like, and he was very open and outgoing always braking jokes. He was very entertaining and this was excellent for my 2 year old as it was his first place like this, and Daniel interacted with him all throughout the meal calling him \"baby\" he would flip the salt shakers in his hat and say \"where did it go baby?\" and my son would point to his hat and he did that every time he flipped something into his hat. I have been to a lot of places like this and by far for here in the valley this has been the best. Benihana doesn't hold a candle to this place do to showmanship and portion quality. I recommend this place if you are looking for a good fun night with some delicious food, I'd be a regular here if it wasn't so far from South Phoenix."}
{"text":"We've been to Hayashi several times now with larger groups and we've always had a good time. We've always sat at the hibatchis  which is fun and lends for an interesting evening.  

We've been to Benihanas several times and honestly, the food is better at Hayashi. We all had different items and everything was cooked to perfection. Nothing was dried out or under seasoned like you often get at Benihanas. JC was our chef and he was funny, entertaining, and fit right in with our rowdy crowd.

The only reason why I didn't give this a 5 star rating is that the drink service was SO FREAKING SLOW! Granted, the restaurant was jumping but it was a really long time between refills and I really hate that and its been like that every time I've gone there."}
{"text":"American Japanese food. If you want to have real Japanese food, you gotta go to Japan. It is not even comparable."}
{"text":"Hayashi is the kind of place that, under the right management/ownership, would be a great place. Unfortunately this is not the case with this establisment. You walk into a dimly lit waiting area and see an empty restaurant. Ive been here three times because I wanted so badly to like this place. Each time however, there was never anyone to greet us, the food was terrible, and nothing has been done as far as maintenance goes. The only positives here are the friendly waiting staff and the calamari. The seats are often torn and the table tops are losing their finish. It is just a worn down place, which is weird considering its not that old. I expected more. I gave them a few chances. Im not impressed at all. Im not going back."}
{"text":"this place is very special
that's how they make you feel.  went there with a big group of 11 and they had their head cook right in front of us and gave us a spectacular show.  the chef had a great sense of humor and was really good with the kids.
loved the food too!  this place can get a little loud but it's a good time.

definitely give this place a try.  Ask for Hieu as your chef!"}
{"text":"Teppinyaki, large servings, great meat and fish...just awesome! The chefs were fun, of course and had the kiddos laughing. The meat was so very tender and seasoned perfectly. We had a full party so the beverage service was a bit slow but expected."}
{"text":"We have been to Hayashi for sushi several times now and I am only reviewing based on sushi in the bar and \"sushi room'.   We have not done the hibatchi although that looks pretty cool if you are in to the Benihana sort of thing.  

The restaurant is large and nicely decorated. The portion size is good, and they have a decent selection of rolls.  However, service has been spotty from a mostly apathetic staff. The pride and warmth that usually comes from serving Japanese cuisine is missing although it seems to be getting better the longer they are open.   It should not be an excuse for a restaurant, but we have always been there on the weekends when they are busist. 

Summary:
3 stars.  Pros: Fresh fish, good selection, nice ambiance.  Cons:  Large restaurant and staff that feel impersonal."}
{"text":"The hostess was rude like she had better things to do. We were seated at the grill and waited 20 minutes for them to come out and cook the food. We got soup and salad and the plates and bowls had broken porcelain pieces coming off the plates and my husband got a piece in his mouth and was told do you want another one . The food is good and over priced you can go to ruth Chris and pay the same and have a wonderful dining experience with clean bathrooms and friendly staff"}
{"text":"We came in Saturday night for a friend's birthday and it was great! The food was wonderful, our server was extremely upbeat with a great personality, our chef was funny and great at what he did. 
They accidentally served our soup and salads to the table next to us so we had to wait longer than normal, but it wasn't a big deal. We probably wouldn't haven't noticed if they hadn't of said anything. 

We'll definitely go back!"}
{"text":"New owners- place sucks..: dressing change tastes like vomit...,rice is greasy, no fresh garlic - food was awful fir what I paid..."}
{"text":"Once a month we are in this area for the past 6 years, and we have never ventured to Hayashi. I was tired of eating Chick-fil-a and needed a change. Well today was the day... This is a really neat setting with the food preparation in from of you, this is only for dinner. For lunch we were directed to the bar area.  I am not a sushi person and its seems that they specialize in that. I do however like California Rolls. Unfortunately, the Rolls were not served chilled like I am assuming they should be. They were made fresh, but the items inside were not chilled. Room temp at most. I ordered Shrimp Tempura and they were ok. Everything on my plate was fried. It said I get veggies with my shrimp tempura and I got Veggies in a batter fried. Kinda grease overload. Our service on the other hand was great. He was attentive and took time to explain and questions I had. This is what was stopping the decline to 1 star. I would like to try the Family style dinner with the chef sometime and maybe that will swing my review some."}
{"text":"Had a horrible experience here! Went with husband and baby, the host said it would be 30 mins! We said okay can we wait by the sushi bar so we can order some sushi while we wait for the tepenyaki table he led us there we order sushi got our food and I guess the host took us off the list because it had been over 45 mins and still no one came go get us! My husband went over to the the hostess to ask what happened and he said okay yeah you're next.. obviously we were not next another 15 mins passed and still nothing again we went to the hostess now with a cranky baby!! And no one in the waiting area! If it was not a celebratory dinner I would have walked out! Horrible service! So after about an hour and 30 mins we got to the table- so annoyed! The worst part is that the owner was right there!!!!! We even talked to her about the wait- nothing!!! We will not be going back! I rather go to ah so sushi on 75th Ave by bell road, great service there!"}
{"text":"New owners have destroyed this place. No garlic for some reason in food now? You can't even request it. No showmanship from the chef. No volcano. No nothing. Server was not very good, would say almost rude. 

The soup is now just like beef broth with couple of mushrooms. No real flavor. 

Even the filet is not of same quality as before.  Just beyond disappointed.

Sadly eventually this will just mean another empty building in Surprise. No way this place survives way it is run now. 

We enjoyed this place before but new owner has zero clue how to run a business. 

Never go back again.  If zero stars was an option that is what I would give.

Please not the recent reviews are very bad. Only good reviews are from before the new owners."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Family friendly!  Food is great. Service is great. Show is amazing. A little slow to seat us even though it was not busy at all but other than that it was a great time!"}
{"text":"Heaven!!!  What can I say, I love this place.  Granted, it has not tasted the same since we moved back, and we have eaten here 3 times in the past month!!  My kids think it is just as good as it was before, however I am on the divorce diet and can not taste anything.  So this review will be based off of their need to eat there once a week - literally.  

They remember who we are.  The wait staff is awesome, always telling me how nice it is to have kids with manners (thank you, I try!) they know my kids know where the \"special\" chop sticks are, and let them get their own.  The cooks are great, throw fake food (sometimes real!)  at you, make lots of fire, and put on a good show! 

If you are on a budget, go for lunch.  You get the same amount of food for 1/2 the price. Kids meals start at $8 - same for lunch and dinner.  It is like having a 2 hour baby sitter!!"}
{"text":"This has got to have changed hands??  Oh, Man...the lunch last week was excellent!  I had the sashimi lunch special and it was excellent!

Sat at the bar....and the barmaid didn't know s... about sushi (don't you people have a training program??)  But she was an excellent bartender and made our experience very comfortable.  Soooo glad I came back.  Maybe only for lunch?"}
{"text":"This place is really cool, but I have been to some better spots in my time. I really like the food selection on the happy hour menu. Teppenaiki here is really fun. If you decided to stop into this place for teppenaki ask for Charlie to be your chef. He is funny."}
{"text":"I am only reviewing the TEPPAN TABLE SIDE: Japanese Teppanyaki steakhouses are my favorite type of restaurant.  I was excited when Hayashi opened in Surprise.  Unfortunately the excitement quickly wore off when I ate there.

**THIS IS NOT A HIBACHI PLACE** Hibachi is with an OPEN GRATE GRILL - you can tell who the N00b reviewers are here to this style of cuisine-They dont know what they are talking about.

I have ate at various Teppan steakhouses in Phoenix, Los Angeles, Hawaii, and Las Vegas so I have extensive experience in knowing what is good and bad teppan style dining.   

If you have never ate at a teppan steakhouse than I am sure you will find this review useless and your experience there great because its your first time.  Teppan steakhouses is the style of Japanese dining where they cook right in front of you. Benihana is one of the more popular chain restaurants that has this style of cooking.  

The chefs are all under experienced (except the master chef who i have yet to see at a cooking table) and the rice, vegetables steak and chicken are all under par in comparison to other restaurants I have been too.  Also, hayashi doesnt have a lunch menu on the weekends, they charge FULL DINNER PRICE. ... Ah-So doesnt do that, you can get the same dinner meal at lunch on the weekend at Ah So for less.

Also, I have a Japanese friend that ate at the non-teppan side and the waitress was Japanese and she found it difficult to recommend a good authentic Japanese dish.  

Take a look at all the good reviews here... not a single Japanese person will recommend this place.  Its GRINGO Japanese,... like Taco Bell is Mexican to people. 

If you are looking for good caliber teppan style cooking this isnt the place... I am sure others will disagree but I also here people recommending great mexican food and when I check it out its totally horrible food... i guess taco bell and del taco are too much of an influence on people in regards to what is real mexican cuisine, but that is another review.

UPDATE: Went there to lunch for just SUSHI and waited and waited and waited... we bailed on them.  Horrible place to eat ... I hope they close and another better Japanese restaurant opens in its place."}
{"text":"The show was the standard onion volcano and spinning eggs. The food was nothing special as it went from bland to weirdly seasoned back to bland. 
Awesome wait staff helped the score but the price and overall food experience means I most likely return."}
{"text":"At first the place looks like it needs some maintenance, but that doesn't reflect the food. My wife and I came for sushi and sat at the sushi bar and enjoyed everything we had. We will be back for sushi and will need to try the Tepan."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Ordered calamari and it looked like it came from a box. Also had a sushi order, worst sushi I've ever had. Table and bar were dirty. Would never go back here again."}
{"text":"Tonight my family and I went to Dine in at Hayashi... When we walked in we were greeted by Shawn... He greeted us with a huge smile and was super friendly.. Shawn has definitely been a server or should be one here because he brings a huge positive vibe and makes the atmosphere at Hayashi. Our server was Ned fast and efficient.. We ordered 3 different types of sushi ( the spicey tuna roll which was amazing, Lv rolls and a California roll for the baby) and beef fried rice... Since it was happy hour I ordered a Long Island iced tea.. It was super strong so I had my husband drink it. He said it was a little strong but he enjoyed it.. We had a great time and we're happy to have a great sushi place so close to home..

If you looking for great sushi definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi. Sushi and drink happy hour is an awesome deal."}
{"text":"The sushi did not have a good flavor and some of the sushi was just wrong!   I do not recommend it!"}
{"text":"We went for happy hour.  The prices were reasonable but the selection left a lot to be desired!  We waited for way too long to have someone take our order.  I had to go ask the bartender to send the waitress over.  The bartender came and took our order and it was probably another 5-10 minutes before our waitress stopped by :/ I'm not sure I'm going to return!"}
{"text":"My family has visited this restaurant many many many times over the past year. It has quickly become my children's favorite place to go. We always sit on the hibachi side.  Although the wait staff is not always super efficient, the actual chefs are always really friendly and quick. The food is always cooked to perfection and super fresh and dinning is always a pleasurable experience . We will continue to visit as a family."}
{"text":"WAY too salty. Waiters spotty. Cook was a pervert and made us pretty uncomfortable. Over priced for the quality and quantity. I would say the sushi is decent though."}
{"text":"The reason that I did not make this rating one star is because they have several specialties which I did not try. We went and only had sushi, which was enough to scare us away. Very poor quality in both the rolls and sashimi. It looked like they did very well with the hibachi grills, but I would not recommend the sushi to anyone.

On the plus side, the atmosphere and decorations were very nice and the server was very helpful."}
{"text":"I took my dad and mom there for a late father's day dinner. We went on a Thursday night and it had a 30 minute wait, which usually means a good sign. We got cocktails at the bar which doubles as a sushi bar. Drinks were priced at $7 range which is decent. When we got our table we checked the menu out and there were many choices. I went for the sushi side while the folks ordered from the menu. Everything was tasty, the service was good and the waitress was friendly. The waitress had a hard time understanding english and miss heard \"Albacore Sushi\" for \"Avocado Sushi\". She fixed the problem by not charging me for the \"Avocado Sushi\" however they did not have any Albacore. Now how many times have you been to a Japanese or Sushi house and they don't serve Albacore? Really that's my only gripe but overall the place was good and planning to go back soon."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice, the second time only to give them another chance.  Did not like the dining experience at all.  Our chef was hitting on another waitress while cooking dinner for our table and then he proceeded to clean the grill with some horrible smelling-ammonia based spray while we were eating!!  i nearly lost my dinner and won't be going back.  My husband wanted to add that he got shorted on vegetables because the chef didn't have enough to go around."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was excellent, food was fast, hot, and delicious. Saki hit the spot. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Service was bad food was just ok. The rolls were very poorly wrapped. The sushimi platter was not good. Bush league sushi restaurant. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Service was great, but the sushi was not. I'm a sushi fanatic and was very disappointed in the quality. The spicy tuna roll that came with my dinner plate was obviously sitting out for a while as the rice on the outside was dry and hard. The seaweed was also chewy. I'm sure the hibachi side is nice, but skip the sushi."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place, I LOVE LOVE sushi and it was GREAT. There are numerous roll selections and they all looked very good. Each one we ordered was tasty, and of course when you go for sushi gotta have a saki bomber! Cant really go wrong with saki and sushi. It was a little on the pricey side. I would return and would recommend it. The place is set up nicely and is very traditional. I am always afraid of ordering desert at sushi places, becuase I have had some pretty bad experiences. We thought hey look they have a chocolate cake how bad can that be. So glad we did order it becuase it was SO YUMMY! Good place for sure. Will return. I just wish they had a better happy hour!"}
{"text":"Best lunch I have had in the west valley in quite some time. Presentation was great, Our server, David was attentive and wonderful, a rare quality these days and the food was delicious."}
{"text":"My folks love this place but I was a bit wary after reading the reviews. I am not a big hibachi fan but they wanted to go for their anniversary. My husband and I thought it was fantastic. The ginger salad; yummeh! The mushroom broth soup; simple and engaging. Even my mushroom detesting husband slurped up the soup, and bonus! I got his rejected floating fungi :-)  I had veggies and tofu; delicious and more than I could eat (or most humans could). Fried rice was addictive. Only complaint is that the delicious teriyaki sauce be applied MUCH more liberally. Staff was fantastic, prompt, friendly and unobtrusive. Our chef was hilarious and made my beloved folks really enjoy their dinner. Not a bad thing to say about this place :-)"}
{"text":"It was alright...not the best sushi I've ever had, but not the worst.  And, plus, we were in Surprise...so I had low expectations.  It was definitely more expensive than we expected.  And, they were missing key ingredients like pickled radish or gourd, so they couldn't make a Futomaki roll or any of the more authentic Japanese rolls.  It's Americanized sushi, but hey, it's in Surprise...what's that saying about a thirsty man in the desert?"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time a couple weeks ago with a group of 8 of us. We arrived at 7 pm on a Friday night, and the rest of our group was just waiting for a table..so we waited 10 minutes and they got a spot for us! They led us to the teppanyaki table, and we were like...uh we asked for a regular table, just for sushi. Our host was like...oh....ok hold on. Waited another 5 minutes so he can \"arrange the tables\" and we walk into this area where there are two booths separated by this small table. So we still weren't sitting together. Then we finally had to move all the tables ourselves so we can sit in a big group.

So we waited at least 15 minutes for our server to come, another 15 for her to come back w/ our waters, another 10 for alcohol. Then we ordered at like 7:45 and I asked for their happy hour menu since it starts at 8. She says ok and doesn't bring it back until after happy hour started. We had separate checks and our sushi came back all on a plate together. The kitchen crew and waitress were super confused, who had all this sushi on a plate? Well I had this one roll, and that guy has that one, and this other person has that one. 

We ordered calamari and vegas roll from happy hour. Calamari was very yum with the sauce, vegas was alright. The special roll we got...I forgot what it was..but it was $11 for 5 pieces, and it wasn't even that good. 

Service was super slow, food wasn't great, everyone seemed so confused there, and we didn't get out of there until 9, and that's with us hurrying our waitress to give us our check. That two hours for sushi. All the other sushi places I've been to and much quicker! and much busier too. If I wasn't with a group of friends that I just met, I would of walked out already. I won't be going back or recommending this place"}
{"text":"I love sashimi.  I would have it every day if it were less expensive.  Good sashimi is not just tasty but beautifully served.  Such was the case here.  I ordered the chef's special sashimi plate.  It came with tuna, salmon, and a few other types of fish I don't recall.  It was beautifully presented -- and in five minutes or less.  I gobbled it down as slowly as my appetite would allow -- so appreciate was I of the display that I didn't want to ruin it too soon.  The wasabi was appropriately hot.  The whole experience was sublime -- even though i was practically the only diner at the 9:30 PM hour.  I would eagerly go back if I lived nearby.  A wonderful place."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here on our anniversary last week.  I usually love the food there.  When we go by ourselves we sit near the bar.   This time the food was a little different.   The first thing I noticed was that the veggies were different. When we dine in the hibachi side the veggies are fresh,  chopped in large pieces or whole, and grilled to perfection.  This time on the bar side the veggies were chopped in tiny squares and there weren't very many.  They seemed like frozen veggies, very soggy.  I got the chicken and steak combo.  The chicken also looked like bagged frozen bits of chicken vs the hibachi side where they cook it and chop fresh right in front of you.   The steak was Ok but slightly fatty.  Lastly,  the meat tasted like it had a propane type of flavor.  Not sure how to explain it other than it tasted like it was cooked over some type of gas.  Overall it was a disappointment.   $70 dinner for 2 on our anniversary and it was no where near the quality it used to be. 
One positive note though!   Our waitress was really sweet,  very attentive and did a great job!   That definitely counts for something!"}
{"text":"My brother and his girlfriend wanted to try out this place. We wanted to sit at the tepan table but it was a 100 minute wait!  So we grabbed a booth. The rolls were pretty food. The edamame with garlic was awesome and we tried the cowboy roll and surprisingly it was pretty good. It's a roll with filet mignon and peppered sirloin. It was a little too pricey for my taste. I've had better sushi and at a cheaper price.  I would probably go back just to try the tepan."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time and loved it. Not sure what happen between then and now but I'm never going back again. My shoes sticked to the floor and the seats had huge holes in them. The table and kids high chair also very sticky. Luckily I had Clorox wipes with me. After wiping it was black. So gross. We always to sit at a area with more room away from the bar. Our food didn't taste bad but if came out one at a time with my appetizer coming out last. No water the whole time. When we paid the waiter returned Large bills in hopes for a large tip. Kinda shady imo! 
Needless to say I'm never coming back. That place went downhill from awesome to hell no!"}
{"text":"First time eating at a place like this. The food was great! The atmosphere was awesome. 

You have a server, who brings you drinks and takes your order. They were very quick. Then you also have the person who's going to prepare and cook your food. Part of your table is the grill they cook on. They put on a show while they cook. My cook made a flame about 4  feet tall. Yes, it  was hot, but very awesome. 

I will be going back and trying another another dish. Very entertaining and great food!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi! Great selection of specialty rolls.
I have not tried the habachi yet."}
{"text":"Being the only sushi joint with a nice atmosphere in Surprise, I decided to give it a try. My first dining experience was awful. The hostess (female, asian descent) was absolutely so rude!! My boyfriend and I stood there waiting to be acknowleged while the hostess was engaged in a conversation with one of her co-worker. She finally looked at us and continued to carry on her convo! I looked over to my boyfriend and said are you kidding me? 15 mins later, we are now seated at the bar. It took about 10 mins to get menus and to get some service! Sushi was ok, nothing great! I couldn't get past the smell of the restaurant. It smells awful..when I left the place my hair and clothes smelled like it. Again, being close to home and really the only sushi joint other than Fresh Wasabi, I decided to go back and give it another shot. Nothing changed...horrible customer service and just super unorganized. I'd rather drive up to Squid Ink and give them my business than ever go back to this place!"}
{"text":"I've gone here for multiple birthdays and a graduation celebration. The food was always perfect every time even when out party was 9 people. Steak and Shrimp is my favorite! The sushi was bomb too!"}
{"text":"Had very poor service today which was unfortunate because the food was overall really good! We got put in the back room and forgotten about for quite a bit. Things got better but then noticed that the waiter put gratuity for 6 on the bill... there were 4 adults, a 20 month old who didn't even get a drink and an 8 month old who old breastfeeds. Just felt like it was in poor taste! Very unfortunate but we probably won't be back"}
{"text":"\"japanese\" steakhouse for the masses, serving mayo-slathered \"white tuna\" improvised-roll CRAP. perfect match for the Bell Road restaurant abyss of HELL.
HEAD TO FRESH WASABI SUSHI BAR DOWN THE STREET.

yeah, yeah... benihana chop chop, zing zing. that's all great, but i look for the seeds of real japanese cuisine, and they're almost nowhere to be found here... (and I gave it 3 hopeful visits before writing this.)

--love the tempura. crab stick tempura is my comfort food, and the tempura is expertly executed. kudos to the kitchen. +star

#beverage menu boasts a broad sake selection, but none of them are ever in stock.
#when asked, the sushi chef promises \"all the fish is the best\". when your chef says that, it means that NONE of his stuff is fresh.
#chef refuses to speak with you when you sit at the bar, inches from him. you must order through the server, and she will speak with the chef.
BUT THERE IS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT!
#and the server does not know the japanese words for anything on the menu!
#after my ticket comes up on his printer, he looks at it briefly, and then continues his side work.
#wait for it.

#entry experience paying attention to all the wrong things.
fused-to-the-sidewalk bird poop all the way to the broken entry door with taped paper sign, \"use other door\", complete with arrow.
exposed water spicket rusting and leaking all over the walkway. Uh oh. reminds me of \"Diamonds Chinese\" (see review)
glass is filthy as is the rotting wood door handle. ew. \"i wonder what's inside\" as i pull the crookedly-hanging door from its frame...
real japanese experience takes pride in the cleanliness of your entryway and the approach of your guest. not here."}
{"text":"I have to disagree with a previous reviewer who stated that Hayashi made them feel special... We didn't feel special at all... We felt like all they wanted was our money; service, quality, and atmosphere be damned!

We arrived last Monday right around 1 pm and found the place near empty save for what appeared to be a lingering ladies lunch group.  Were we seated with them even though open seats remained at the grill and the chef was still cooking???Nooooo... We got placed at the first two seats of an empty grill... Then told to wait and see if anyone would be joining us... Did I miss something? Did I sign up for the 1 pm group dining session? No, I did not, but what do they bring to my table almost 15 minutes later?  My beverage?  Nooooooo... They bring us one of the most acidic and toxic personalities I have ever been forced to dine with!!! He was pretentious, slovenly, rude, imposing, possibly wearing a toupe, and a show off; and that's the nice things I have to report...  What's worse is that he is clearly a regular and all the staff clearly knew this about him!  So why would they seat him with first time diners when there was no shortage of chefs????  Because they did not care to make us feel special...

Drinks arrive but the main man has to ask twice for sugar.  Getting refills was like begging for rain in the middle of a Phoenix summer... Futile!  After being there almost 45 minutes we are allowed to order sushi but still no grill chef in sight...

The sushi was ok... At least we didn't get sick.  Remember our obnoxious table-mate???  I agree with him on one thing... The sushi chef that day sucked... The rolls were loose and turned into piles of rice and fish with a mere touch of the chopstick... Real bummer.

The grill was marginal... Oh, yeah, the chef appeared at the hour mark... Yeah, we are feeling very special now... He swung his knife and spatula about and set some oil on fire... Oooohhhhh... Aaaaahhhhh... I'm friggin hungry!  Make. My. Food.

I end up with a pile of fried rice that, frankly, could have come from anywhere.  It lacked any seasoning at all and none was available on our table.  The veggies were fresh but like the rice, unseasoned.  Do these people watch the Food Network?  Do they not know that a failure to season is a food felony???

And finally, the meat lands on our plates... Cooked fine but, again, not seasoned in any way... So I had a good size pile of flavorless, almost texture less, non-descript food in front of me.  And by now I am so annoyed with my forced seating and table company that I want to run screaming from the place!!!!

Instead, I ask for a to-go box, because I think my dog will like the pile, and the bill, because I am now hoping to escape this hellish experience by 3 pm.  I get the box and the bill and we run for our lives... At 3:05 we are safely on our way... And NOOOOOOO we won't be back...

Hey, I guess I do agree with one of the prior reviewers, Hayashi did make me feel special... Just not in a good way.  I hope others have a better experience but for us, this was two hours of our lives we will never get back!"}
{"text":"Because I have eaten at Hayashi's sushi bar and teppanyaki-style grills, I will review them separately, because they are totally different experiences, in and of themselves. 

Sushi bar:
Pros: upscale, trendy surroundings, bartender was pleasant and helpful. Lots of choice on sushi rolls; unfortunately, most of these were not raw, but cooked, deep fried, baked, etc. 
Cons: like a reviewer below me, the tuna roll was LITTERED with sinewy strings, making for a very unpleasant texture. The sushi was served room temperature and the quality was not at all what I expect. Basic rolls run $6-8 off happy hour, pay $10+ for specialty rolls. 

Teppanyaki-style grill:
First off, please save yourself a dime and the space in your refrigerator: SHARE YOUR DINNER ENTREES. I took my grandmother for lunch and for the two of us, we spent $60. Entrees are pricey, but can be shared for a small fee. Appetizers are really unnecessary unless you have a large group or are VERY hungry as the dinner entrees come with plenty of meat and veggies. My chef seemed experienced, albeit young, and provided lots of flair and entertainment. Obvious cons are that the food is very pricey and you may have to wait awhile until the seating around your grill has been filled. 

To sum....

Sushi: skip it, unless you are desperate and really have nowhere else to go.

Teppanyaki: go for a special date, anniversary, etc. Don't bring young children as the dramatic flame surging from the grill and the clanging of knives makes them scream and cry for a half hour on end ;)"}
{"text":"Went to Hiyashi tonight for the first time (BF had been there before), we sat at the sushi bar and we were served by \"Paul\". He did tell me his given Chinese name but I apologize I can't remember. He recommended rolls for us and even made us samples, we tried some things we might not have otherwise ordered. He talked to us and was very polite and funny. The food was good; but while there are numerous sushi bars in the valley, the main reason I would go back is because of our sushi chef."}
{"text":"I really liked the sushi we ordered here. We were hesitant since it's been hard to find good Asian food in Surprise. I thought it was yummy and will go back. Only complaint I will say is that the booths were sticky and dirty and the place had a funny smell I know it sounds bad.. But honestly food was good no issues. Hopefully it's cleaner next time. Staff was super nice."}
{"text":"Service was just ok.  Food? Awful.  Decided to stop in with a friend of mine because we wanted sushi.  Our normal spot is Kabuki but wanted to try this because I live close by.  Big mistake!  The rolls were falling apart and they just didn't taste right.  Needless to say I haven't been back and I don't plan on it."}
{"text":"Don't believe the 1-star review posted here by Debra O. We were skeptical about trying Hayashi out after reading it, but went anyways and discovered it was really just a big lie...probably someone who works at a competing restaurant.

The prices were normal for a hibachi grill / sushi place...not cheap, but certainly not any more expensive than other restaurants of this nature.

The food was quite good.  The Japanese onion soup (while not miso) was better than the starter soups at most places, the salad was good, as was the fried rice and vegetables. Everyone seemed to enjoy their main course as well.

All in all, it wasn't the greatest Japanese steakhouse I have been to, but certainly better than average."}
{"text":"Filet Mignon and Scallops were delicious. Fried rice was ok. Soup/ brown broth were not great. Salad was mostly bad lettuce and curdled looking dressing. We decided to opt out of the show and just order from the kitchen for time constraints . We enjoyed watching the other tables show, especially seeing the kids enjoy. My biggest bummer is the back of my chair was falling off. In looking around that was the case for many chairs. The menus were ratty and in need of repair. This naturally makes one take note of the overall disrepair of the waiting area plus more. This is a newer restaurant and should show better. Overall, entree's and staff are good, management should work on the details."}
{"text":"Okay, first of all, it's not hibachi. It's a teppanyaki grill. Secondly, do not go on Friday nights with your little kids or else you will expose them to drunks who yell and curse like they where at their houses. Overall, the food is not too bad. Especially the soft shell crab appetizer. I love the way they cook and serve it. It is so addicting. On weekdays, after 8:00 (maybe 9:00), they have a reverse happy hour on drinks and menu items. It's a pretty good deal. The service is good. Pua is our favorite server. As for our Teppanyaki grill master, I forgot his name, but he is good. He said he is from Manila of Chinese ancestry."}
{"text":"Food was okay... Teppanyaki Chef was fun and good but other service was not so good.

Things made me sad:
#1. Long waiting time... Took waiter for very long time to stop by and bring us check... The restaurant wasn't really full capacity. It is either manager is too cheap to hire more people or someone called in sick...

#2. I brought coupon on Passport on my iPhone. They told me it needs to be printed out on paper in order for them to take it... really???"}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour lunch specials with a variety of options for the sushi/sashimi crowd and those who like their food cooked.

Update: sick after. Would not return."}
{"text":"We tried this place yesterday so that we could take some food to the drive ins for our date night.  Based on previous reviews I ordered the orange chicken and my wife the orange beef.  The chicken was amazing.  All white meat cooked crispy and drenched with the orange sauce.  Beef exactly the same and not chewy like other Chinese places."}
{"text":"Much like judging a book by its cover, when walking up to the entrance to Hayashi you will be disappointed in the appearance of the facility.  Within 40 feet of the front door I spotted 2 empty Budweiser cans, an empty soda can and an empty bottle of sun tan lotion.  Petrified chewing gum and dirt graced the concrete in front of the entrance doors. 
The restaurant's outdoor appearance was a mess, but read further.
Once inside, as a couple, we only had to wait maybe 10 minutes to be seated with a two other couples at a grill.  The interior of the restaurant was average and in need of a small tune up. The menus should be replaced as they are worn, and their spines looked to be in need of duct tape.  The staff was attentive.
Heiu, our table master, redeemed the evening for us.  He was funny, and talented.  Absent his better than expected performance and cooking perfection, the establishment would have receive one star from me.  The food was moist and delicious.
Do not be put off by the slovenly appearance of the restaurant's exterior. Hayashi did deliver the goods as to an entertaining dinner and good food."}
{"text":"Love this place. I always sit at the bar and never had a bad experience. The food is always great and the bartenders are friendly New York roll is my favorite."}
{"text":"The review is not for the food.  We are new to the area and wanted to try this restaurant.  I just called and the number is no longer in service.  Bummer! :(  I think we will try Osaka in Peoria since that seems to be the next closest Teppanyaki restaurant.    Hopefully people will call or check yelp before going there.  

Owners - you really need to update your website to remove the location on Bell in Surprise."}
{"text":"Great cook: we had a really nice time at Hayashi on Bell.  I would have liked to have rated them higher, but...we had a reservation and were greeted and seated immediately at an open hibachi table.  Our waiter, Joey was brand new (first day) but did an excellent job taking care of us.  He was prompt and courteous.  Our cook, Hector, was also very nice, had very good skills with his utensils and quite funny.  His jokes were new to me and the routine was the usual, but very well performed.  The food was very fresh and the scallops and calamari steak were cooked perfectly.  Unfortunately Hector went way to heavy on the salt and pepper and that overpowered the meal and left us all very thirsty.  Fix that and I would have given them 5 stars."}
{"text":"If you don't have time for a full dinner (awesome, btw), check out the happy hour specials.  I think I've had all of them by now, and they're all delicious.  The dipping sauce they use for the japanese chicken nuggets is amazing and I wish I could buy a bucket of it. Atmosphere in the place is relaxed and comfortable.  
Service at the bar could be better."}
{"text":"Hayashi is a GREAT place for good sushi/sashimi and drinks! We've never done the hibachi side, but we love to sit in the bar and order sushi. All their rolls are superb, with fabulous presentation. Also, if you're a fan of the Vegas Roll, be sure to ask for it! It's not on the menu, but they'll still make it, and it's WONDERFUL!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Have been several, SEVERAL, times to both the sushi bar and the grill. 
The staff was very friendly! The food was amazing and fresh and they dont skimp at all on the portions. The price is also very reasonable especially at lunchtime. 
The grill room at night is alot of fun. If you order a saki bomb they usually will ask if its your first time.. always say yes. haha.. they have a way of doing the saki bomb in thier own Hayashi style. They pour the japanese beer in the cup and the saki in the shot glass. They then put two chopsticks on the rim of the glass and set the shot just barely on the chopsticks. They have the whole table yell.. SAKI BOMB! three times then they bang the table and the shot falls in the beer and you chug it. Although you do not have to do this it is alot of fun.. The chefs are a riot with jokes and they usually chop up small portions of food as they are cooking and try to have people catch it in thier mouths.. if your up for it. lol
My husband and I are just starting to get into eating sushi. We have went to Hayashi 4 times now for sushi and each time the staff was more than willing to help make suggestions and explain the whole process to us. We had such an awesome experience the last time we went that I actually asked for the employees name so I could give KUDOS to him. Thank you Michael Berry for not only your knowledge and suggestions on sushi, but also for your great personality and hospitality! This place has an excellent staff all around. :) I would reccomend this place to anyone looking for a fun time with good service and good food."}
{"text":"So I'm from Cali and I came here for the first time. Very good sushi.  And the people were very friendly.  Everything was very fresh and the flavors were good. The ambiance was very nice and chill. Strong drinks frm the bar. 
I would highly recommend this place. 
I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this place! The husband and I go for lunch specials, so the restaurant is quiet and the service isn't in dinner rush mode.  There is also a familiar feel when going at this time. Hayashi definitely has bar regulars and it's wonderful to watch and partake in the conversation the whole room seems to be having. 

The sushi is amazing here and the the hibachi grill is okay, they could give you a little more chicken or steak for the regular price of the meal but thats okay. 

My husband is allergic to some foods so we always have to be careful where and what we eat. 

  Great atmosphere, accommodating service."}
{"text":"Punchline: expect a wait for food and inattentive service on weekdays, but sushi is terrific. Recommend the King Maki and Times Square rolls and sashimi."}
{"text":"So my best friend in the whole world (and another Yelper) was born on New Year's Day, and her daughter was also born the same day.  (What are the odds??)   They wanted an intimate get together to celebrate both of their recent birthdays and this restaurant was their choice.   

Okay, no point in beating around the bush...I'll just come right out and say it; our waitress was friggen awful.  She left us high and dry for several minutes at a time and she completely forgot to bring me a high chair.  Finally after waiting for about 30 minutes for her to remember to bring me a high chair, another diner at our table went and found one since I was having trouble keeping my wiggly daughter sitting on my lap.  

And I could make a big deal about the fact that we were seated for probably 30 minutes before she even took our orders, and probably about 25 more minutes before they brought us our appetizers, and that she never even once asked if we wanted to see a drink menu and I finally had to ask if they even offered cocktails and that finally prompted her to produce a drink menu about 20 minutes and another request later (20 minutes, I'm not kidding).  

Since my husband doesn't drink and is my permanent designated driver, and we were celebrating, I got a pineapple mojito, minus the pineapple.  No, I didn't order my pineapple mojito without the pineapple, it just came that way.  So it was just a mojito flavored mojito.  Now, to be fair it was still a damn tasty mojito, but I don't think it had passed within 22' feet of a pineapple, EVER.  I'm just saying.'  Our waitress obviously didn't notice that when she got our order from the bartender either.  I just have to repeat it; she really isn't very good at what she does.  I'm sorry, I know that is harsh.  And despite the fact that I was in a party of three (yes, I knew the other diners, but we were all on separate checks) I still got hit with an automatic 18% gratuity for a large party.  WTF?  Really?! Ugh...   

But then let's talk about the food.  When they finally decided to serve us food it was a mixed experience.  My baby daughter got a tempura plate and I think she really enjoyed it.  She ate a little bit of everything and enjoyed dipping her fried shrimp and veggies in the dipping sauce.  I tasted her food and it wasn't bad at all.  And the mushroom soup that comes as an appetizer with the teppan entrees is delicious.  I mean really, really good.  I don't know how they prepare it, but it was staggeringly good and I would've consumed a gallon of that stuff.  Also, the salad with orange ginger dressing was very cold and crisp and delicious too.  

For dinner my husband ordered the vegetarian teppan and I ordered the combo teppan dinner with scallops and sirloin steak.  (Side note: I love scallops, but the last 3 times I had them prepared in a restaurant I had gotten violently ill.  I knew I was taking my chances with getting another bad batch, but I wanted scallops again so bad I decided to roll the dice.)  The good news?  I didn't get sick afterwards, these scallops were very fresh.  The bad news?  They were so fresh that they still had fresh little pieces of sand embedded all throughout them.  You never want to bite into a scallop and hear a crunch:  EVER.   Also my food was horribly over salted, and I do mean horribly.   I'm no shrinking violet when it comes to salt, but this was too much salt, even for me.

Also, my scallops were done cooking a full 15 minutes before my medium rare steak was done.  That kinda sucked as they could have easily been timed better by the chef.  Our chef was very friendly.  The fried rice that comes as a side with the teppan dinner was pretty good, but nowhere near as garlic-buttery-tastic and delicious as the chicken fried rice served at another unnamed teppan place that I routinely go to in Tempe...

The damage for our whole dinner and my drink was about $70, so it wasn't too bad in the grand scheme of fresh prepared teppan dinners.  I just wish the service had been better and the scallops hadn't been full of sand. 

But you know what's most important? That my best friend and niece had a great birthday party.  And at the end of the night, despite the hiccups with the food and service, I think they did have a good time.  And THAT is *still* what matters most to me.

PS:  Sandy scallops=YUCK!"}
{"text":"I read the review that Steven E. wrote only minutes ago and quite frankly I am so embarrassed by the filthy conditions of this eatery. As you know, the Japanese take extreme  pride in cleanliness and neatness. This restaurant  is a disgrace to the Japanese culture and community at large. I have not eaten there nor will I unless they clean up their act! The owner, if he is Japanese, should consider hari kari. I hope he hasn't damaged our reputation too badly! My suggestion is to close down for a couple days and scrub, clean and polish from top to bottom and keep it that way! My apologies  to the loyal patrons for this sacrilege."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Horrible service. I know it's New Years Eve, and we had a reservation for 8:00pm. We were sat at 8:05. It's now 9:35 and we have only received our drinks. Other tables that were seated after us are eating. The manager came over and said there was a miscommunication between the hostess and the server and then he walked away. Bullshit! I'll never return here again. If I knew we could eat at another restaurant this evening, I'd walk out. POOR MANAGEMENT.

UPDATE: After 2 hours, and not even a second round of drinks, we DID walk out. Now eating at Chili's. Great service here."}
