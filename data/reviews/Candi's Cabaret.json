{"text":"Nice place...Great beer prices....cheap dance prices...the park lot is too on small so get there early...mix drink expensive and watered down."}
{"text":"this a small little cozy strip club where dances are $5 and the dancers are average at best.  if you like friction for $5 you can get it poppin.....a bucket of bud lite (small bottles) cost $9-10...  *warning there was a shooting at this club last year it was just on the news....come to this club in the day time during lunch....its safer and the dances go up at night to $10 per dance. they need to upgrade the caliber of women though.....dj kinda corny also....NEVER EVER send the girls to get a drink for you....they keep your change and lie about prices.....a handful of very grimy characters posing as dancers.  The bouncer is a shady suspect individual....he's pretty disrespectful with the dancers."}
{"text":"I only come through on Mondays for the All You Can Eat crablegs for $30. Not a bad deal and you get Corn and garlic bread. The dancers are basic and not in great shape but it's entertaining to watch while eating I guess."}

{"text":"I frequent this place often..  Never have I been impressed..  Very small and when busy its cramped. I have been trying however to help the business by bringing my friends who don't think twice about leaving two or three hundred dollars at any time. Today I visited with a friend who works with the Carolina Panthers.  Normally I'm asked to park upfront because my Corvette was scratched in the parking lot one night.  The bouncer was extremely nasty & told me that I had to park in the back.  $60,000 Cadillac coup, wasn't happy.  Enter club & ordered lunch.  Waited so long, that I was ready to leave.  I was however trying to convince my friend that this place was not a bad spot.  I asked a dancer to give him a lap dance which is usually $5.00.  After her dance she asked for $20.00.. I asked why so much, she says I gave him four dances.  I told her that I asked her to give him a dance, not four.  She insisted I give her $20.00.  I gave her &10.00 to compromise.  As we started eating, the thug bouncer threatens us that if we don't give her another $10.00 he will kick us out!  I'm glad she stopped after four dances, she could of taken me for everything.  Watch out in this place..  I had $300.00 that I planned to leave in this place as usual.  It wasn't the money, just principle...I'm sure they will loose plenty big spenders from how we were treated today..  Can't believe the owner lets this kind of thing happen..Suggestion, girls should tell or ask guest if they want another dance..  Just lost a lot of money coming in to this club!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, so many lovely ladies here, and great prices. Very outgoing staff, they make you feel good, and seem to like their work. Light and dark girls, amazing bodies, definitely recommend to stop by here if you need a place to chill out in West Charlotte."}
{"text":"Only three dancers during an nfl playoff game. Weak af. The dancers were cool tho. A lot of tvs so you can see the game from anywhere in the club"}
