{"text":"Incredibly poor value. A salad with no protein and only 4 toppings costs $9. They won't even let you mix lettuce. All of their wraps are pre-made and sitting in a refrigerator so they are not fresh. Who knows when they were actually made? There are better choices in the same food court so avoid this one."}
{"text":"After shopping for about 5 hours, I needed to have a fuel break so I was looking for something healthy as most of the restaurants in the food court were fast food so I ordered a wrap BLTA (bacon, lettuce, tomato, avocado) and it was just the ticket!  It was very filling and was just what I needed to keep my energy going."}
{"text":"This by far is my favorite place in this food court .. north outlets isn't known for the best food in my opinion but this place was a pleasant surprise .: They offer affordable items that are fresh with friendly service .. take it with a grain of salt because it is a food court plus it's a place that has people who may not be gourmet. It did however please my taste buds and left me feeling full .  Plus they give 1 free refill on Soda so I dig that a lot .."}
{"text":"So so bad...the whole experience was bad. The food court is small, noisy and seems kind of dirty.  The food was...ok? I had the soup and half sandwich which was bread with something inside. The soup was soupose to be clam, but it linda look like sour cream with artificial flavour and had chuncks of something inside, but I'm not sure of what. The service was polite to a certain point.  They clearly didn't have the patience to let me chose much less to answer my questions. I didn't dare to ask for any especial requests, that's for sure.  After a $10 or so meal I was still hungry, so that's the size of the portions. Well you can expect much for a mall food court either way, right?"}
