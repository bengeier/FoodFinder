{"text":"My friend and I went there around a month and a half ago and we ordered 2 pizzas to share and I remember it being pretty good...We went on a Friday night, and it was surprisingly not very busy there.   The most memorable thing about this restaurant, I have to say, is its service - it was excellent. I am pretty sure that the server came to pour us water over 10 times in the 2 hour span that my friend and I spent there. We were catching up from having not seen each other for 6 months, and the server just kept checking up on us to ensure we were alright with the drinks, the food and pouring us water. We ended up giving him a super generous tip due to that. A+ for awesome service! The environment was also really casual and welcoming. Good for catching up with friends and long conversations."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant on a friends recommendation. The atmosphere was too noisy, you had to yell across the table, it was freezing due to the blowing AC. We had to ask to moved; no offer from the waitress with many empty tables around us. Our waitress got our order wrong and did nothing to rectify the situation ( ie. free dessert or drink); just a mere apology. The pizza itself was great though. I would not go back."}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed with my visit to Double Zero based on all of the great reviews. It might also have to do with the fact that I can only eat the gluten free crust. When we arrived, they didn't even asked if we wanted to sit in the lounge or dining area, and took us to some secluded table. We picked up our jackets, and sat ourselves in the lounge area where it was a bit busier. We ordered the mushroom pizza and the Waldorf salad. We intended to have these as our own separate dishes, and the server didn't ask if we were sharing, and automatically assumed we were so she brought everything on share plates. My friend asked for chicken on the salad (thinking it would be a nice grilled chicken breast), and received shreds of chicken that tasted like one of those Safeway rotisserie chickens. The salad was not that great, and she ended up sharing my pizza with me. I don't think the pizza was anything special. Same as any other pizza place around Calgary. I was hoping they would have a gluten free crust with that home made texture, but rather it was yet another piece of cardboard out of the box. The only place I've seen offering the gluten free crust that somewhat resembles their normal crust is The Libertine Public House."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza!!! Very Rich toppings! The $5  happy hour is a great touch downtown too. Our group tried the: speck, pepperoni, chicken and sausage. Very generous on the toppings! Rich and flavorful. Crust slightly crispy and chewy.  To compare to Una: Una has less rich toppings, but is lighter and heavier on the salt. Una has a thinner crispier crust, but can be a touch too hard. Free Parking in The Core downtown parking lot."}
{"text":"I'm not overly sure what all the hype is about over this place.  For being a pizza joint the options were very underwhelming. I came here on a Friday afternoon after getting off early from work. This place fills up fast so you might want to try and make a reservation if you want a spot. We saddled up to the bar and ordered a couple of drinks to start. The music was pretty loud so it was hard to hear much, but we made due and ordered arancini to start and it was the best part of the night for me. Then we shared the sauage pizza. It was just ok in my book not mind blowing in any kind of way. And by that point the place was packed and the nosie level was extremely loud. Not sure if I would want to come back to this place for a second try. It's decent but I have had way better pizza elsewhere."}
{"text":"My  second time to Double Zero on a Friday night and the place is packed! I'm glad this place finally caught on. Had a glass of wine and possibly one of the best appetizers ever, the Roasted Cauliflower. CRAZY DELICIOUS! Besides having obviously cauliflower, was fried chickpeas, capers, pecorino cheese and bits of spinach. A deadly combination. For the portion we were served, I found the $14 price tag a little high, but it I enjoyed every bite. I hear they have half price apps during the week . . . Hmmmm. . ."}
{"text":"Crazy good! No wait, crazy, crazy  good! Loved the atmosphere here. And this restaurant is definitely not a Famosa knock off. Way better than the aforementioned restaurant. I love a great thin crust pizza but I seldom eat the top crust. Not so here. Just couldn't get enough of the whole slice. Highly recommended. Apparently on Friday nights, this place is packed. Reservations recommended."}
{"text":"Neapolitan style pizza that's got a good thin, toothsome crust and bulbous edge.  The toppings are high-quality and the saltiness just right.  The grilled lemon provided adds a great zing when sprinkled on the toppings.  I'd give this place 4 stars, except that it's a bit pricey for the size of pizza you get, putting it a shade below other Neapolitan-style joints like Famoso. Of course, you pay for the central location with 00.  The house wine is quite drinkable at $7, and $5 during happy hour. The main area where they could raise the bar is appetizzers like the arancini, which while decent would be better \"al telefono\" (with a mozza cube) or even better \"alla bolognese\"...you know, a little treat in the middle to make it seem worth 4 for $12."}
{"text":"Worst pizza ever. It took me over 2 hours to even get a pizza, and when it arrived, my 10 year old sister could have made it. Worst pizza, worst place ever. I can't stress it enough. It took me over an hour just to create an account to post this. Sorry Double Zero, but you should be closed. Period"}
{"text":"This was my first time at double zero. We headed out on a Saturday night for a dinner for a friend who was in town.   Our reservation was for 8pm. Upon arriving the hostess quickly identified our party and we were seated right away.  The initial wait for wine was a touch too long but when our waitress came over it was worth it. She knew the wine list well & was able to help us make a selection based on our price point & preferences.  We ordered the mushroom & mortadella pizzas and they were amazing! I can't say how impressed I was with the food.   Our waitress was great, our wine was always attended to and she did extra things like making sure we always had water.   Great experience, I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Ok pizza, doesn't come near UNA or Without Papers.  Being a downtown office zombie, I am always looking for something new to try other than the food courts. Double Zero makes a very good first impression with its basement location, nice decor and friendly staff. Sadly it falls off the road when it comes to the food. Pizza bottoms are soft & mussy while the outside crusts are chewy.   Had the rapini & margherita pizzas. The garlic on the rapini dish over powered all other flavors. Other than the sub-par crust, the margherita pizza was ok.   Overall, nothing special and not worth $16 a pizza. Back to the food courts!  14/30"}
{"text":"This restaurant just opened in the lower level of the Core Shopping Centre, in the old Tangerine Supper Club space. The entrance is right off 4th Street.  My friend and I went for lunch on a Wednesday and we got a table, but it was pretty full, so if you go you might want to make a reservation.  The inside looks cool. There's a nook with walls covered in library-themed wallpaper that I now want in my 'house to be'. The lights are cool (maybe industrial-chic?) and there's a variety of tables so if you prefer benches, tall chairs, big tables or tables for two you'll find something. There are pig statues here and there that my friend thought were cute, but they reminded me a bit of fetal pigs from high school. Luckily, I'm not that sentimental.  The menu isn't limited to pizza, there's paninis and salads too, but we had to try the pizza. Luckily someone told us that a pizza and an appetizer would be enough, so we didn't order two. Then again, when is leftover pizza a bad thing?  The Roasted Cauliflower appetizer with fried chick peas, sultanas, and pecorino cheese was delicious and not your typical appetizer. I'm not usually  a chick pea fan, but these ones were different than usual. Fried makes the difference! The \"Pepperoni\" Pizza with smoked calabrese sausage was delicious and they didn't skimp on the pepperoni. It was a bit saucier than some flatbread pizzas I've had and the bread reminded me a bit of naan. I'd definitely eat it again, but not until I try some of the other flavours.  I think it would be a great place for happy hour and big groups too. Worth a try if you're looking for pizza downtown."}
{"text":"Since the first time I visited, I go back to this place as often as I can. I've even brought new friends with me every time! Delicious, thin crust pizza, cold beer and great atmosphere. What more could you want? The Polynesian Princess is a must try - an intriguing take on Hawaiian. A little bit spicy, sweet and salty. So good!"}
{"text":"The pizza was excellent.  I'd definitely come back again.  We shared 3 pizzas among the three of us, and it was just the right proportions."}
{"text":"I love Double Zero and go here all the time. Their happy hour is the best... $5 glasses of house wine and prosecco and $5 \"snack\" portions of their appetizers, which are all amazing.   Just tried the marinated beets tonight: awesome flavour combination (grapefruit, goat cheese, and pistachios.. yummmm).  And the calamari... I think it's the best in the city. Love it.  Beyond the great food and drinks, I really like the ambiance. Good crowds, great decor... it's very warm and upbeat."}
{"text":"i am pissed. the food was good but the waitress assumed we wanted this bullshit \"environmentally friendly filtered water\" that is $1 a person when we just asked for water. they do this bullshit in europe all the time and i suppose i let my guard down by assuming that a restaurant in America would know better. i pointed this out to the waitress whom very reluctantly took it off the bill. a manager tried justifying this by namedropping a bunch of shitty pretentious restaurants in calgary that also partake in this practice, which didn't really help.  and don't get me started on the scam and the huge lie behind filtered water somehow being more environmentally sound than other forms of water. our society is getting dumber and dumber, less and less critical. only chumps buy bottled water when they live in a society that has clean, fresh, ubiquitous, drinking water. people in the third world must be amazed by how far we go to be wasteful. paying money for something that is free. only in the \"first\" world.  **update 20may2014**: i now live in Africa, and yes, people here are amazed that north americans pay for water . by the way, i've had better pizza here than anywhere in calgary. 1 star."}
{"text":"I'm not exactly sure when the trend to upscale pizza started but Double Zero sure is trying to continue the momentum.  I'm sure some doubted the wisdom of renoing a space that's seen a couple of recent failures (most notably the easily forgotten Tangerine Club), Double Zero is in what used to be a fine go to spot... the Elephant and Castle Pub... and the new space is excellent!  As is the trend, everything is upscale but not poncey... the food is very much the same.  Obviously the choice is pizza and theirs is very fine... they're no Pulcinella but fine nonetheless.  Location is everything I think for Double Zero and their site is about as smack dab in the middle of everything as you can be.  I see a very bright future for this new 'not your every day' pizza restaurant.  Very well done!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I heard about Double 00 in a positive light. We walked in and not even a smile from the dowdy server who asked where do we want to sit. Not even a \"hi\" or \"welcome\". I do love the interior design, it's upscale and cozy.   One of the irritating issues was the music. It was so loud you couldn't hold a conversation. We sat at the bar which is fantastic in itself. We had an excellent male bartender who was friendly and engaged with his customers. Later in the evening, a female bartender (short, red hair, Aussie/Kiwi accent) joined him. She had attitude the moment she started. She didn't even acknowledge us. Not a \"good evening\" or even a smile. There were only a handful of people.  My girlfriend and I sat at the bar with empty wine glasses for quite a while. When she did serve us she measured the wine. When she served the males, she free poured the wine.   One of the things we thought was inappropriate is we had a full view of the kitchen. We saw the kitchen staff eating on the line. Ugh.... may go back for drinks, but definitely not dinner."}
{"text":"It was a birthday gathering with a party of 15. Our server was Antonio. It began with a slow service, took forever to wait to get him to take orders. We had 11 people sit altogether and two people that was in another table being separated by a small gap. So to have a more inclusive environment, friends merged the table and Antonio said that there was a reason to not put the tables together. His reason was so that it would be easier if anyone needed to get out to go to the washroom. But even so, that would be something that we would deal with and in fact no one had to get out. So being told that we can't have the tables merge when we are willing to move if someone needed to get out, was shocking.  Friend ordered calamari, the 4 people around her heard her say that she wants calamari but Antonio said \"no you did not order calamari, you did not say that you wanted calamari\". Rather than being defensive, would it not have been better for Antonio to apologize? He then asked if she wanted to order it and yes she indeed wanted to. It was what she wanted in the first place before the pizza.  Antonio had a very passive aggressive attitude, rude most of the time. He would get upset if we merged the tables even after we finished eating and were just sitting there.  I specifically told Antonio that we had people coming a bit late, but he failed to acknowledge and cut the cake into only 10 uneven pieces. Leaving some people without cake. It's a birthday celebration after all.  Antonio was very rude when it came to not allowing us to change seats during the meal. It's understandable so that it's easier for him to print the bills. But again, we do not need to be babysat and need someone to figure out the bills for us if it is all just going to be printed off individually anyways.  The jokes that he said were not funny, they are rude and sometimes offensive. We were a diverse group of people, of all ethnicities and we value respect highly so it was very disrespectful for a waiter to disregard any of that.  I have had multiple large group gatherings at Double Zero before and this is the worst experience I have ever had."}
{"text":"The one and only time I was at Double Zero was for lunch, and it was ridiculously loud that I didn't really enjoy my experience there.  When my girlfriend suggested happy hour there, I figured I've give it another shot. We arrived shortly before 5 o'clock and it was pretty full (and LOUD) already. We got seated at the bar which I honestly didn't mind because then we were sitting beside each other and I could hear our convo.  The bartender was quick to get our drink orders, and we contemplated over the menu. Remembering there was a happy hour menu online, I went back to the hostess to ask for one (I'm not sure why she didn't give it to us in the first place). We decided on calamari, caprese salad and meatball panini.  I was mesmerized by the bartender's skills, he was pouring beers and mixing drinks so efficiently - I think this is a rarity nowadays, good on ya bartender dude!  Our food came out pretty quickly, the calamari was crispy (although the sauce was at the bottom of the bowl so the end pieces were pretty soggy), the salad had nice helpings of tomatoes and mozzarella and the meatball panini was really savoury.  I noticed that the entire dining/bar area is too open concept so people are talking over each other in addition to the music so it gets excessively loud. They need to add some sound barriers (divider walls maybe?) to help this problem.  Would I be back? The food is definitely a draw for me, however I wouldn't go with a group because I think trying to listen to everyone talk over the surrounding noise would drive me insane. Although I wouldn't say no to another one-on-one with a friend here if the opportunity came up."}
{"text":"I liked the pizza (Chicken confit) and the wines they had available were quite good. I like that they have a lot of wines AND a lot of beers and cocktails so there is something for everyone. The pizza is fresh with delish ingredients...it was hard to choose which one we wanted to try. I like that the food is no fuss no muss but tasty. It means you can focus on who you are with. It seemed like regulars were well recognized by staff and treated accordingly which was nice to see.  One complaint...when it is busy it can be a bit loud to have a conversation or hear yourself think. So it may not be a great date spot unless you are at that stage in the relationship where you enjoy each others silence."}
{"text":"\"Funky\" is Double Zero's M.O. Funky's good, funky's fun; but dig beneath the funk, the fun photography and all those cool little light bulbs that make up the sign and you find a pizza that's good, but not great.  When someone says to me, \"Wanna go to double zero?\" I shrug and say 'Yeah, I suppose.\"   Double Zero makes a solid pie, but I find the crust a bit too crunchy with not enough soft, the overall a bit too greasy with not enough napkins at the table and the toppings a bit too bland with not enough extra-cost additions.  A little extra coin at Double Zero means that adding prosciutto to the mushroom pizza gives it a nice edge, or adding chicken to the rapini gives it a robustness that cuts the grease; but I don't go to a funky pizza joint in order to be upsold on the menu items to make them better. I like, and will pay for, an add-on that makes a great meal go \"wow!\" but I am on the fence about an add-on that makes a decent meal go \"better\".   To be fair, I have only ever eaten pizza at Double Zero; but I do expect a place that markets itself as being a pizza joint to have above-average pies and although Double Zero is funky, they need to spread some of that funk on the pizzas.  T."}
{"text":"oh my glory, this is good eats.  I finally had a chance to go to double zero, and to be honest I'm sad I waited so long!   Came in on a whim on a Saturday night, and I was actually surprised by how empty this place was. We opted to sit at the bar . We had a fennel and orange salad as a starter and what a delicious way to start things off.   I don't remember what pizza we had but I know it had arugula on it and I know we loved it. Rarely do we eat more than half of a pizza when we go and with this one we just could not stop.  We even carried on to have dessert, a strawberry shortcake I believe it was - and it was to die for. It was all I could do not to lick the plate.   The service was great, friendly and attentive and the food. I have to come back again to see what the consistency is like, and I have plans to bring some out of town company here for the experience.   Love."}
{"text":"Double Zero is a upscale restaurant in the core of downtown Calgary. It's a great spot for lunch, but make sure to get there early or call for a reservation unless you don't mind eating at the bar (which is actually my preference).  When at a Neapolitan pizzeria, I don't mess with appetizers or mains, but the dishes I saw leaving the kitchen certainly looked well presented and a properly proportioned. You will not likely leave Double Zero hungry.  Both the pepperoni and confit chicken pizza's were tasty, well seasoned and served piping hot. The crust was crispy, tender and fragrant, but it didn't pass my horizontal flop test that I think a good Neapolitan should.   If you want to treat yourself to one of the better Neapolitan pizzeria's in Calgary, give Double Zero a try."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service! Good eats as well. Caprese salad could have been improved with ripe tomatoes. Tasty 'za - keep it simple works thanks to the stellar crust. We will be back."}
{"text":"Okay, It was a while ago that I went to Double Zero, but it certainly was memorable!  I remember it clearly...  My friends and I went to check out CRAFT Beer Market (also awesome) for its grand opening, and ended up going for dinner at Double Zero.  So we walked from CRAFT down to Double Zero... just a hop and skip, really.  Anyway, we commented that it was a little too loud at CRAFT, so they offered to seat us in a little quieter section of the restaurant.  This impressed us, and we followed the hostess to a quiet area near the kitchen (surprising, yes, but very nice).  The whole dining and bar areas, though, are quite nice.  I remember when that space was the Elephant and Castle (crashed a wedding party there, but I digress...).  Hopefully this one sticks.  At any rate, there were three of us, one of  whom is vegetarian.  So we ended up getting two pizzas: one veggie, one not.  The selection of pizzas is impressive, as is the staff's knowledge of their product.  I am a beer lover, and was quite impressed with their selection.  Tree Brewing is great, but I decided to go for something a little different with the Aphrodisiac Stout.  Our server was wonderful, talking about the beer and how much everyone loves it.  There was a lot of hype, and I was not disappointed.  I recall ordering the perogy pizza, but don't remember what the other was.  While both were fantastic, I did seem to enjoy the non-perogy pizza more.  Just wish I could remember the name.....  Anyway, the menu is great, and since that time they have added pasta to their list of offerings.  The decor is very nice, with authentic Italian product displayed all over.  Photos of local people, by local photographers, adorn the walls.  I had to ask about purchasing some of the product on display, but for the moment they are not for sale.  They may introduce a retail operation in the future for those who want authentic Italian goodies.  Or you can go to one of several Italian markets in town.  All-in-all, we were very impressed, and will most certainly be back - and not only to redeem our one remaining Groupon."}
{"text":"Why some restaurants in a fantastic location with great food remain empty for dinner will forever be a mystery to me. Double Zero Pizza is such a restaurant.  I went on a weeknight with a friend and was quite impressed with the giant staircase leading down to the restaurant, with huge lights spelling out Double Zero Pizza. Once at the bottom of the stairs, I was impressed with the decor and how big the place was. But.. it was mostly empty. Anyway, we were seated right away in a cozy booth near the kitchen. My friend ordered some kind of chicken pasta and I ordered the potato/egg/spinach pizza. My pizza was really tasty! My friend's pasta was not bad either. Our waitress was perfectly nice and helpful.  So that is why I stay confused. Why was the restaurant empty, other than 2 other occupied tables? The food is great, the space is great, service was good.. Its a great restaurant to have on Stephen Avenue - why isnt this place buzzing?!  Until I figure out this mystery, I will make myself a regular patron and bring whoever I can to these establishments. Granted its a new restaurant, but it would be a big shame if Double Zero decide to close down because they are not getting enough people through the doors! I have had this happen to too many fond favourites!  Pizza-loving Yelpers!! Go there now!!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner before catching a show downtown. We were seated right away, and attended to right away by our fabulous server James. He was super friendly and personable, without being annoying. He was quick to let us know about the serving style of the restaurant (family style), and what to expect portion wise so we could order accordingly.  We were hungry, but didn't want to have to carry leftovers into the theatre, so we split a small Caesar salad and the sausage pizza. Although the salad was \"small\", there was plenty for 2 people. It was a little fishy for my taste, but nice and fresh. The pizza was excellent. Nice thin, crispy crust, topped with sausage, green onions and artichokes. They also provide parmesan, chill flakes, and chill oil on the side. It was very tasty, and just the right amount for 2 people.   Overall this is a great restaurant with a fun, casual vibe, excellent food, and great prices! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Loved the Calabrese panini. Meats and bread were excellent, all was tasty, and the bill looked good too ;)"}
{"text":"It was a trying time figuring where I should celebrate my birthday this year and thankfully my wonderful Yelpster homies (specifically Sabz) helped me decide on where I should eat and thus I chose Double Zero Pizza.  First of all I have to thank Double Zero Pizza for even letting me have my party of almost 20 that night because when my best friend called initially they weren't sure if they could have us all there that night due to the fact that there were so many other big parties in attendance. However, they did call back and it did work out that I could fit everyone in and that was that.  Walking down the stairs you kind of have the hustle and bustle pub feeling but once you start turning some corners you have a really intimate atmosphere. I really love restaurants where the lighting is dim but not too dim where you can't see your food. I loved how they positioned their lights to highlight the tables as well as the canvas posters on the walls. I also really liked the fact that the dividers/shelves are hollow and you can see through into the kitchen.  On the menu and over the phone they let us know ahead of time there would be a 18% gratuity however I'm not entirely sure if that gratuity was added or not because nothing on the bill reflected this and if it wasn't thumbs up to Double Zero Pizza for that.  Our server, I forget his name was attentive to us for having a fully booked restaurant with people everywhere, he tried his best to keep the water coming and any refills on any beverages we may have ordered and did not get any of the orders wrong either.  I ordered the Confit Chicken Pizza, which I felt like would be the best pizza to have on the menu as a first timer here. I am so glad I chose this pizza cause it was delicious. I loved the fact that the pizza is thin although what I disliked was the crust which I thought was a bit too much. The Confit Chicken pizza had fontina, mushrooms, and smoked pancetta on it.  Had the opportunity to steal a slice of my friends pizza and they had ordered the spinach and potato, added the bacon and voila it was a tastey piece of pizza. One of my other friends went a different direction and ordered the porkchop which he said was the best porkchop he has ever had. I will definitely be back here to try it out for myself. I also ordered a side of calamari which I enjoyed although I think it could have just used a little bit more of that sauce it comes with.  Really enjoyed this place, I'm going to definitely be back to try the other pizza's as well as anything else on the menu that looks just as appetizing. Thanks again Double Zero pizza!"}
{"text":"Had the margarita pizza and mushroom pizza last night and it was amazing  probably one of the best pizzas I've had! The atmosphere and service was great as well def recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Double Zero, named after the flour that is (properly) used to make the crust, does an excellent job at crafting true Neopolitan pizza. The crust, as many have mentioned, is possibly the best and most authentic I've ever had in this segment. The toppings are generous (for the style) and fresh.  The prosciutto is lightly smoked to perfection, with fresh arugula, mushrooms, and top quality cheeses.  The service is quite good, serving the corporate downtown quite well. It's friendly if not a little bit sterile, but good nonetheless. The water is not free, but instead uses profits as charitable donations which is cool with me.  Because they appear to adhere to the Napoleana rules, the diversity is somewhat restricted in their pizza selection. However, if that's what you're after, Double Zero will not disappoint!  It's my go-to for said style."}
{"text":"I have to say I'm sad I was disappointed with this place, as I was so looking forward to trying it. I have wanted to check out their GF pizza, as I was told by a girlfriend that it was good. It was a work function that brought me here on Friday. The pizza was sub-par at best, no cheese and really thick cut meats so it was hard to eat. And the crust was nothing special.  The champagne was wonderful tho, especially being $5 during happy hour. Service was pretty good, considering we were a group of 40 people.  I'm sure I will return here for drinks, but I wouldn't go out of my way to suggest it."}
{"text":"We decided to go here lunch one Thursday during the summer for a friends birthday. It was a cool day which was good because the restaurant is in the basement so there's no patio or opportunity to enjoy the weather outside while you eat.  We made a reservation for a party of 8 at 11:45am and were seated promptly when we arrived. After having been seated, We were entertained at our seats by a couple flat screen TV's showing tennis (US Open) and baseball. Still, we got a bit impatient as we waited for 15 minutes before deciding that a server wasn't going to come (no drinks or food menu) and we'd have to go ask for one at the front. They apologized for this and gave us a free set of appetizers and our server was very attentive to us after our mild complaint.  The appetizers and main dishes were very good, especially given the price. As for a main meal, I probably won't be back too soon as I find these authentic Italian pizza and wine places can become a bit boring after awhile given that they don't have much variety of other foods. If you're looking to grab a glass of wine and split a pizza or two with friends after work on a rainy day this may be the place for you."}
{"text":"With a $5 happy hour from 3-6, Mon-Friday, this is a great spot to wait out the C-Train rush.  Hold that thought. Double Zero Pizza is good place to eat for many occasions, ESPECIALLY if you want pizza!  While it's located in the The Core Shopping Centre, there is nothing \"mall\" like about Double Zero. Personally, when I'm looking for a nice place to chow down on fine food and hang out with friends a mall food court is pretty low on the list. Double Zero is NOT this... so what is it?  Descend the stairs underneath the CHICAGO style lightbulb Double Zero sign and you'll find your place in a classy yet comfortable, \"come as you are but you probably came from your office job,' Neapolitan Pizza, wine and quality beer bar.   Heavy wood tables, bare bulb lights, bookshelves with hosts of canned tomatoes, Village Brewery growlers and a few white ceramic pig mascots make Double Zero a good place to unwind while you're in the core, but don't want to feel out of place because your'e still wearing your business blazer.  I rocked a mortadella pizza and managed to stuff the WHOLE thing in my face. Thin crust with puffy edges so you can pick it up with your hands, a tasty tomato sauce with a fair bit of basil goodness, piled high with mortadella and... pistachios?? Weird, huh. They were also my favourite and the most standout part of the pizza to me. I loved loading this sucker up with the fresh parmesan, chilli flakes and chilli oil that comes with it.   If you're hungry, you could probably put down 3/4 of a Double Zero pizza.  This works perfect if you're a group of 2. Order a pizza to share and then a side or two to go along with it. If you're really hungry, yup, you can do a whole pizza! I did. ;) *brag brag brag*"}
{"text":"I must be the odd duck out when it comes to Double Zero. The pizza is good enough, but the menu is painfully limited when compared to my favorite pizza destination, Pulcinella. Their antipasto plate is tasty, but again, doesn't come close to comparing with that provided by Pulcinella--for the same price, I might add. The space is large and casual, but this is one of the reasons sound travels so well. If you're looking for a jumping hot spot for a pricey slice whilst hanging out downtown with friends, this is the place. But if you're looking for something a bit more intimate--where you don't have to shout to be heard--look elsewhere. Good pizza, good service, but there's better out there for sure."}
{"text":"This is a great Famoso knockoff, and a good option for good pizza downtown. The place seats many and is upscale; great for business lunches - there is never a huge wait and there are private meeting rooms available. The meatballs are also to die for! Oh and I should mention: they have gluten free pizza!  i would not eat here over famoso - it is too expensive in my opinion and they do silly stuff like charge you for a glass of water. However it is a good upscale business lunch corporate function kind of place.   Oh and no debit, only credit cards and cash. It's weird."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant with great pizzas and a fun atmosphere. Very nice presentation of the food and it is not too expensive. I would go again!"}

{"text":"I have since returned to Double Zero and had some non-pizza items, and they were great. The lamb meatballs and beet salad are both delish!"}
{"text":"English first, then a couple of words in Italian for my fellow countrymen.  I am always on a never ending quest for a pizza that comes close to those from the motherland. While I must say their margherita pizza was slightly thicker then a typical brick oven one from Italy, it hardly a deters me from giving 00 pizza my two thumbs up. The flavor is what counts. The mozzarella wad fresh, tomatoes San Marzano and, MOST importantly to me, the dough was evenly cooked...  Per forza di cose capito in questa \"trattoria\" alla disperata ricerca di una pizzetta decente e devo ammettere che 00 pizza e' stata all'altezza delle mie aspettative. Ho provato la loro margherita e benché fosse leggermente più \"spessa\" della tipica pizza italiana (di poco) aveva un ottimo sapore, la mozzarella era evidentemente fresca e i pomodori sono (secondo il proprietario) San Marzano...BUON APPETITO!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and comfortable atmosphere. Great place for a corporate team lunch. The antipasto platter is very good as well."}
{"text":"Good selection of food choices- $5 select appetizers during happy hour (highly recommend the cauliflower dish, it's amazing). Had the pepperoni pizza, it was pretty bland.  Haven't tried the other pizzas yet but probably won't based on that experience. Fast & friendly service, nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Classic Italian style pizza, the perfect lunch for a Friday afternoon at the office.  I was quite impressed by Double Zero Pizza. Normally when you hear a place has gluten free pizza crust you don't expect much. It over powers the pizza and drowns out all of the flavors and really distracts you from the fact that you're eating pizza. Double Zero does it right though. I ordered the mushroom pizza on gluten free crust and was not disappointed. The toppings were about the perfect amount with a delicious sauce. The size of the pizza was about the amount for a really hungry person (I should probably only have ate half but it was too good). Service was also great and the food was ready very quickly even though it was pretty busy.  You'll see me back here especially for this $5 happy hour (3-6 PM Monday to Friday)."}
{"text":"I had a friend in town last night and we went by Double Zero to have a few drinks. We had the opportunity to speak with Chef Rob while we were there and he suggested a few things to us, so we ordered them up. We started with the 00 Meatballs which were very fresh and moist, like Mama used to make back in Little Italy Ontario. We also had the Roasted Cauliflower, jammed full of chick peas, capers, raisins & cheese, even though my counterpart was nervous about it. It was a real hit with both of us and so good and we were racing to get the last bites of it. We ended with the Spinach Potato Pizza which was also good, but I think I prefer the Confit Chicken which I had a few weeks ago.  It's a nice space on all sides and very comfortable. The staff was also very personable every time I've been. Great spot."}
{"text":"Best gluten free thin crust we have had. The staff here is excellant and check with the kitchen to make sure what you order is gluten free. We had the white pizza chicken confit and the sausage with the red sauce. I think I prefer the red sauce but had to try the white garlic sauce. The server did advise us that we could substitute sauces, next time chicken confit with red sauce. Highly recommend for gluten free pizza lovers"}
{"text":"This is a popular corporate lunch spot for me, they do a good job of accommodating groups and we're blocked of large areas for parties in the past. It's located on the bottom level of Core Shopping centre and is worth making a reservation for if you're going at lunch time because they can get really busy.   You can't go wrong with the pizza here, I stick to the classics and usually order the margherita but they have some great mushroom pizza options as well. Make sure you try the chili oil if you're looking for some added heat, it's really good.   They also have really awesome Happy Hour Specials, for $5 you can try all sorts of things but I've got to say the brussels sprouts and the cauliflower are delicious, like you're going to want seconds and not share a single bite of those veggies they are that good."}
{"text":"Double Zero, I am hooked. My sister and I had a dinner date, so we picked Double Zero as our destination. It was a Friday night and we didn't make a reservation, so there were no tables available, but they kindly seated us at the bar.  The wine menu is extensive - I'm not a connoisseur by any means but had fun picking out something to sip on.   We ordered a beet salad to start - the beets were huge and numerous and the sauce delicious. YUM!  We were unsure at first as to what a Pizza Blanco is but were intrigued to try the mushroom pizza. We figured perhaps they didn't add cheese to these pizzas, but after asking it turns out that the pizzas don't have a tomato sauce base but instead an oil and garlic one.  Our food arrived promptly - the pizza was amazing.  I will definitely be back - hopefully with a table next time :)  (17/30)"}
{"text":"Just like last time - the service was solid.  The appetizers were so so. All had pizza which were average.  I believe the issue at this establishment is the high volume they have moving through - volume has been chosen over quality (my opinion). Price point is still set high - high price = elevated expectations.  We had planned on Pucinella, but diverted at the last minute..."}
{"text":"My friend and I were disappointed with our orders.  She ordered the Chicken Confit Pizza and I ordered the Roasted Vegetable Panini with a side salad of the fennel and orange.  Chicken Confit Pizza - bland and not enough meat at all.   Roasted Vege Panini - very, very bland.  I couldn't tell what I was eating.  Side Salad of fennel & orange - not too bad.  I like the macadamia nuts that added texture.  The fennel had a nice crunch.  All in all - not a good an experience at all."}
{"text":"It's a popular Pizzeria in downtown, and you won't be disappointed. their thin crust pizzas are always yummy, the service is good and the prices are reasonable.  Don't go if you are in a hurry, since during busy hours sometimes your order can take easily 30minutes to arrive. For weekdays lunch time, be sure to book on their website or by phone otherwise you might end up waiting, or being seated at the bar..."}
{"text":"Double Zero is my go-to happy hour spot when in the downtown core. All you need to tell me is $5 wine and prosecco and I don't care what it is, I'm there. I've been to this spot when it used to be Tangerine Supperclub, but somehow for a restaurant it doesn't quite work. It's dark, it's loud, and it's small. And those stairs to get in? Scary in heels. However, I'll eat and drink in a broom closet for $5 glasses of wine and prosecco.   The past few times I've been here, I've ordered food off their happy hour menu as well. The first time I was impressed, the meatballs and calamari were delicious, albeit small portions. The second time was disappointing - the waitress was persistent as hell (clearly, we were catching up and had a lot to talk about, yet she kept popping in every 5 minutes to ask if we wanted something else, or if we had decided on food, etc) - and the food was below average. Our calamari was SOGGY - not crispy at all. I did enjoy the prosecco as always and our bill was delightfully cheap.   I know I'll be back for happy hour, no doubt about it. I just hope they improve the food quality because soggy calamari is a big no-no. I don't mind the noise, but don't come here if you want to have a great conversation - you'll be yelling across the table at each other."}
{"text":"This place is good. I mean WOW good. Its super delicious in terms of their food. Wait can be a bit long though. So my colleague suggested coming here for lunch. She ordered the pepperoni pizza and I got the Linguini Carbonara. The Linguini Carbonara has pork belly in it. WOW that was delicious. It wasn't super oily or anything. I tried a slice of the pepperoni pizza and it was good as well. Also don't forget to ask for shredded cheese for the pizza and for the linguini, it makes a difference.   So this place is located in the TD Core mall. It is in the basement. Décor is nice. Its definitely a popular dine out place.   Only issue is wait can be long for the food. We sat down and ordered right away but still we waited like 45 mins for the food. So yes we went back to work late. Sad but it was worth it.  I highly recommend coming here. I like the pasta more than the pizza."}
{"text":"I can only speak for the bar section, coming right down from the stairs of the front entrance. Great reinvention from Tangerine, the spaces are edgy and dark, true pizza joint orange lighting, TV's to the front and back of the bar to catch all the sports action.   Bar nibblets from $5 are amazing, and I recognized the Tree brewing beers right off the bat. The pizza IS DELICIOUS. They advertise a gluten free pizza base yada yada I forget, anyways suppose to be really good for you, but the point is, CRIPSY to the bite and CHEWY in your mouth. We ordered the italian sausage and it was amazing. Simply delicious.  Would I recommend this to friends? Yes. Will I be hanging here more often? Oh hell yes."}
{"text":"I really liked this place, and I especially loved the $5 happy hour (house wines, appetizers and delicious prosecco)! The ambience is lovely here, it has kind of a rustic feel, which makes it feel totally authentic. The pizza I had was delicious and the dessert was pretty good as well. I was stuffed after this meal, but this is normally the case when I eat Italian food. Simply put this place is great, a wonderful date night or a great place to hang out with the ladies. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Dear server, did you really just wrap my olives in saran wrap and bring them back to the table for me to take home? Yeah ya did! And with a goofy, helpful smile on your face. \"We didn't have any boxes that small,\" you replied with a slight shrug. It's better than no olives at all to take home, right?  He's the kind of server that makes me want to use the word unpretentious. And even though the decor is more upscale chic meets a slight casz tilt, he's the kind of server that makes Double Zero a comfortable place to hang out.  I met Merry K here for lunch, and if you hadn't guessed, we started out with a bowl of olives. We also split the mushroom pizza and the mortadella pizza. Both were tasty, but I'd pick the mushroom one again over the mortadella!   We lucked out by showing up early for the lunch hour. We didn't have a reservation, but there was still a table left. I'm so glad we were early! Not 20 minutes later, I think all of the tables were full. Looks like it's already a popular lunch spot."}
{"text":"Was here for happy hour.  $5 wines (red/white/sparkling)   Happy hour calamari was meh.... The batter totally did not stick....  Margherita pizza was pretty good, crust was crispy bottomed and not soggy.   Server was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Having booked several corporate lunches and after work parties here, service is great but it's very loud and hard to have a conversation across the table. You will be shouting. Atmosphere aside from volume, is dark and minimalist in a comfy way. Pizzas are great if you like thin crust- which I adore!!! I have tried every single pizza on the menu in addition to fennel salad, the beets and and the basic caprese salad. All were tasty. The prosciutto arugula and mushroom pizzas are yummy. I also like the chicken bacon but it's a tad salty. The pepperoni does have a spicy kick and the meatballs are average to me in flavour and texture. I'm married to an Italian and have found meatballs to be a measure of true greatness and simplicity while being a cornerstone of childhood memories. My fave meatball in Calgary is at Scopa. But that's an entirely different review!!!"}
{"text":"There seems to be a recipe for fancy pizza place success here in Calgary. I've distilled it down to what I eloquently call the \"Fancy Pizza Place Success\" theory.  Want to open up a fancy pizza place in Calgary? Well I've got just the ticket for you! Just follow our five step program and you'll soon be whistlin' dixie on your way to the Italian bank!  1. Cook pizzas that are really flat, like a truck ran over them or a really pudgy Italian mistress sat on the crust in a fit of rage.   2. Top them with fresh ingredients; but just for sport, don't make the \"classics\" that someone could go and get at Little Caeser's. You don't make Pepperoni, that's for the greasy 16 year old running the assembly line at Pizza Hut. No, you make \"Pepperoni\" (actual menu item, quotes included) with spicy calabrese sausage (oooh, doesn't \"calabrese\" sound exotic?) and all beef smoked salami! (All beef! Not like our competitor's partial-beef salami!).   And then put ingredients on them that nobody would understand. Like Pine Nuts. Where do pine nuts even come from? That's what the people at your tables will ask. \"Where do pine nuts even come from?\" \"I don't know honey, ordering that might be a little risky!\" - \"Risk be damned, it's date night! I'm throwing caution to the wind. I'm ordering the one with the pine nuts!\" - \"Oh you stallion of a man! I can't wait until we get home so I can show you what I think of your wild and untamed ways!\"  .... That was a bit much maybe, but I can imagine it happening in real life.  Add pistachios and artichokes to get that \"artsy and we know it\" feel going. Hell, how about some spinach and potato on a pizza? Can't be done, you say? Too out there, you say?! HA! Let the world watch as you spit in the face of culinary reason.   Your customers are going to think you went to fancy pants chef school. Only YOU will know the secret.  Round out your menu with some random appetizers like beets, cauliflower or the ominous sounding \"Shaved Speck\", throw a couple craft beers on the menu to show how funky and eclectic ya'll are and call it a day. Boom, roasted.  3. Have a cool space. You should probably hire your coolest, weirdest aunt to design it. Make it look like you're in a wine cellar or a subway system or something. And put a bunch of Italian pops all over the place (Pellegrino? Yes please, but I'll take the one that came from the fridge thank you very much). That oughta make the place look authentic.  4. Have servers who actually give a damn about making their tips, probably because they're in a downtown location where really rich dudes who park their Audi's and Porsche's in the TD square location go for lunch to drink too much with each other and talk about rich people stuff. That seems oddly specific, but trust me, just go with it. And make sure your servers wear all black, because that is the universal dress code for \"Prepare to part with exorbitant amounts of money.\"  5. Pick a cool, trendy  name nobody understands until they ask about it. Like Without Papers. Or Double Zero. Or Famosa. Or if you're really creative, something like \"On The Wire\" or \"Whore de Fromage\".  In seriousness though, my experience here was a good one. While nobody can say that these flat pizza places are all that original anymore, the service was excellent and the ingredients on the pizza were well chosen.  Our server was attentive, brought everything on time and was friendly, so A+ to him and his Caeser-cut-fauxhawk that reminded me of when I used to be able to do my hair that way. Ahh, memories.   I had a few Thirsty Frog or Tree Frog or whatever type beers and enjoyed not being in the rain for an hour or two. The only thing I could have done without was paying $12 for parking after - roughly 2/3rds of the cost of the pizza I ordered and then forgot the leftovers sitting at the table.  But that's my fault, not theirs, so I'll let it slide.   In the end, this place slots right in there with WOP and Famosa when it comes to this style of pizza. They're all solid in my mind, so Double Zero is in good company - and might just have the best crust."}
{"text":"It was time for a Wednesday night ladies' night and we needed to decide on a place, so we turned to our food  guru, Christine.  Christine chose double zero because she mentioned there was happy hour from 3-6pm daily from Monday to Friday.  Happy hour consisted of $5 selected house wines, bar snacks, draught and bottled beer.  Christine and Jaime met up around 5pm and I was running late so I arrived closer to 6.    Normally, looking for a parking spot down in the core is pretty difficult but I got lucky as I found a spot right across the street from 00.  I walked down the set of stairs to meet up with my girlfriends who were sitting at a table in front of the bar.  Double zero is a place you hit up after a long day of work to let loose, shoot the shit and have a couple beers, or ....a couple glasses of Prosecco for us ladies.  Since I arrived later, Christine and Jaime shared some starters and ordered some $5 Prosecco.  Thankfully I didn't miss happy hour as Christine ordered some '00' meat balls and a glass of Prosecco.  We then ordered a mushroom pizza to share.  I found the mushroom pizza didn't have enough toppings for my liking, although it tasted great...I was wanting more cheese and mushrooms and less crust!!  The Canella, Prosecco di Conegliano Superiore was sweet and bubbly...just the way I like it!  Lastly, anybody that knows me, knows that I have the biggest sweet tooth so I decided to order the chocolate torta which was chocolate mousse, raspberry, hazelnut praline.  I found it very rich, silky smooth and tasty.  Gahhh I love sweets!!!  It was pretty much divine.   Overall, the service was wonderful and very attentive, ensuring that we were enjoying everything and everything was indeed great!!  I would definitely recommend  double zero if you like $5 snacks and prosecco! :)"}
{"text":"It's a nice restaurant and bar but I wouldn't drive out of my way for it.  The Chicken Confit pizza is delicious and I sipped some respectable Pinot Grigio, but nothing else stood out to me, really.  Fun atmosphere though and I'd be happy to come back if it was convenient or part of a group get together.    Review 9 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge - Nov 2012"}
{"text":"Very good Gluten free pizza (could have used a little more sauce though). Amazing place. You would never think it was a pizza place. I can very well imagine the perfect place after work! Great layout!"}
{"text":"Okay double zero...I like you! I have been so hard to please having had so much pizza during my trips to New York, but I must say you aren't doing so bad. Your pizza is fresh and I like your crust. There is nothing worse to me than having pizza served to you that looks as if its been sitting under the heat lamp for far too long and an overdone crust that has the power to crack off a piece of your tooth. I kid you not, this has happened to me!   I usually have my traditional favorite \"pepperoni\", but last week I decided to go for the \"salami\". It was delicious and as I said, very fresh! Had a tiny bit of a kick to it, which is just enough for me (not including my additional chili flakes) and not too spicy for those that have sensitive tummies.   I also like your happy hour!! $5 appetizers, house red and white, as well as draft beer (happy hour as it should be)! Not so common these days, especially in the downtown core. The ambience isn't bad either. Its pretty bumpin' on Friday nights tho, so consider making a reservation. Really though...is it happy hour yet?"}
{"text":"Usually super love the gluten free margarita pizza. Today it was like the dough changed. More herbed in flavour and I don't know if the word is soggy but weirdly flexible. I'll still be back. It tastes so good."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband and another couple. We were seated at the bar on the high top tables. The place was super hard for all of us to find but we found it, across Holts. You walk down stairs to get to the restaurant.  We ordered the antipasto platter to start for 2, it was huge! Fed all 4 of us, that was $24. We also ordered the Caprese large salad $15. Everything was great and REALLY big portions. For mains we ordered the Waldorf salad, Pepperoni pizza and the grilled vegetable pizza (I believe) Everything was good and nice sized. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Review Haiku!  Best menu item Cauliflower sage appy Pizza average  That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"I loved double zero!  I had been wanting to try it for a long time after hearing great things about the restaurant for some friends and finally made it there a couple of weeks ago. The decor and atmosphere was cool and trendy, and the food was delicious! We ordered gluten free crusts for the pizzas and you could barely taste the difference. I was particularly impressed with the chicken confit pizza and the mushroom one. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Great place for a few drinks after work!!.. The pizza is delicious!.. I loved the crusty!.. The appetizers are really good too!!.. And the wine was great!!.. The atmosphere is cool... I would definitely go back there!!"}
{"text":"It's noisy & busy at peak hours but I've never had a bad meal here. The roasted cauliflower is to die for, as is the Polynesian princess pizza! Very good! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed :( Wish I wasn't, but I am.  Went to Double Zero again with some friends, and the service was just not up to par. I was really hoping they'd wow me this time with amazing service, but unfortunately not.  We asked for tabasco sauce and our server told us they don't have any, which we thought was strange because last time we were able to get some. Don't they make Caesars? First pizza place I've been to that doesn't have tabasco.  After paying a 16% tip for mediocre service, our server came up to us and rudely accused us of jipping him of his tip. He was adamant that we had left him less than a 5% tip. We were confused because we were certain that we calculated the bill appropriately, so together with the server we re-counted the amount that was paid. Sure enough our server was wrong. He had counted incorrectly. He misread the bill.  He apologized afterwards; however, his rudeness and poor attitude was unacceptable, and made him look extremely foolish.    I won't be returning to this restaurant. My friends and I will recommend others to opt for pizza restaurants, like Una or Without Papers, that provide high quality pizza, and understand the idea of customer service."}
{"text":"Double Zero provides fresh, flavourful pizza. Like so many of the other Napoletana pizza places in town, you get a thin pizza with high quality toppings. What I like about Double Zero is the crust seemed to have a bit more \"chew\" to it.  I very much enjoyed my experience at Double Zero (the sausage pizza was my personal favourite), but I gotta be honest, I am getting a little tired of the same style of pizza over and over! Come on, Calgary! Let's get a little diversity going!"}
