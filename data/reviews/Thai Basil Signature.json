{"text":"If you are looking for a nice place to eat and enjoy yourself and your partner or your date. This is the place. A quite place to chill and wonderful food to enjoys. Excellent service that bring a smile home."}
{"text":"I have been to Thai Basil over 5x. Each time I've gone I've tried something new and everything is very tasty. You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"We love this place! The service here is seriously exceptional! Very fast service and excellent Thai food! You will not find better Thai food in Paradise Valley! Very pleasant environment for a date night or for the whole family!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, I order different things; the laarb is good, a little bit on the sweet side. What they consider \"Thai spicy\" is not spicy at all. Most of their food is sweeter than the average Thai food but I'm guessing it's the preference of the chef, my favorite thing about this place is their things you can add to your dish for spice because I love Thai peppers in fish sauce on my rice...it's my favorite Lol. This is a good tame thai place to go to if you haven't had hardcore Thai food and want to ease your way into it."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant. Nice atmosphere. Not the quickest service, but the friendliness of the servers more than made up for it. I had the red curry (which I got as a 4 on the spicy scale) and it was fantastic. Also got a Thai iced tea. Will return here."}
{"text":"There was hair in my food.  There was also hair in the food of another couple that walked out twenty minutes earlier (after announcing the problem quite vocally).  The wait was horrendous.  We weren't the only ones complaining.  The service was awful.  The waitress failed to give us napkins, forks or knives.  We literally had to get up repeatedly to ask for them and actually grabbed the napkins ourselves from a basket on the counter since the waitress rarely came to see about us.  The only thing the server brought quickly was the check after we told her we were leaving after finding hair in the food that we'd waited almost an hour to get!  Yes, we paid for the non-hairy food items (no offer of any discount) and left, never to return again!"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Love this authentic Thai food!!  Not impressed by the ambience in the restaurant as they often don't keep it as clean as they could.  But I don't care because the food is so good!  Definitely my favorite Thai food in the area, reminded me of being in thailand."}
{"text":"My review is for the Thai Basil at Paradise Valley Mall (Cactus at Tatum) and this is the worst Asian food I've had.  When we walked in I saw someone's dish and thought it looked bad - I wouldn't be ordering that...but, my wife and I ordered two different dishes and they both looked like the same grayish beige pile of crap with meat that looked liked boiled dog (her's was supposed to be pork, mine beef...mine was un-chewable). And kind of expensive -  $11.95 for some slurry that at 3.95 would still be crap but at least priced appropriately!  We ate there some time ago, shortly after they opened - the menu was more extensive, the food was good and was preceded with a well-prepared soup.  This time much more limited menu, everything looked the same and no soup."}
{"text":"Update - Have become a regular and love the Cashew Chicken.  Good service and great for take out.  ----- So first time to any of the Thai Basil's around the valley.  It's a nice downtown location on Adams and Central.  I grabbed my order to go, but they had a good happy hour special that I didn't get to take advantage of since it was take out.  There was a bottle of Mekhong sitting on the bar, which sounds like a spiced rum, and the special was the Mekhong Ginger Lime Long-Tail.  Will try next time.  As for the food, the Cashew Nut had a rather zesty flavor especially on the backend, but I ordered it medium spicy and it fell way short.  The over all tast was good and comes with rice.  But the Pad Thai, I think they need to go back to the drawing board.  Very bland and didn't really activate the palette at all.  Almost like they only used half the seasonings.  It did have mushrooms, green beans, carrots, cabbage, and maybe some bean sprouts on the plus side.  Portion size was large, but really need to double down on the seasoning and spices for that large of a portion.  The service was very friendly and accommodating while the decor was inviting.  I'll definitely give it another try, but shoot for something a little more exotic like a curry or drunken noodle.  Always willing to give a second chance."}
{"text":"They have great food but the service has many kinks still to iron out. The tables and chairs are so close together, you feel as if they stole the design out of a French restaurant playbook. We visited at high noon, their busy hour. We were seated right away, poured water and 15 minutes went by before someone came to take our order. Another 20 minutes progressed before 2 out of 3 meals were served to us. 10 minutes later, we were able to flag down a waitress to inquire about the 3rd meal. They left to get it and came back with a different meal, stating they forgot to make it so try this alternative instead. Meanwhile, the fan above us sat motionless (much like the wait staff). We asked if they could turn it on, they said yes but did not turn it on. Our drink cups were empty half way through a spicy meal. Finally, a waitress can by to fill them... half way. Strange I thought, why fill a glass only half way? The bill came quite timely. Processing my card took another 10 minutes. Overall, the food was quite tasteful. The wait staff looked harried (including some guy dressed in a Hawaiian shirt rushing 4 huge bags of ice into the back kitchen. All the time we were there, I noticed they seemed to be several steps behind. Patrons around us had a similar dismayed look on their faces. Hope they polish this aspect because the food was made well."}
{"text":"Ordered noodle soup with tofu and no cilantro. Got noodle soup with no tofu and lots of cilantro. Complained to the lady who gave me the food about the mistake and got ignored. So, I ate it. The noodle soup was kind of tasteless. Complained to the guy who bring me the bill later and got 20% off. Pay with credit card, but he charged full price on the card. Left no tips later and wrote on the back on the receipt that tips is already included."}
{"text":"Ordered lunch special and the price was good-the drunken noodles were tasty and food came out fairly quick. Service was so so. I felt our waitress was overly busy and just couldn't keep up because of low staffing. Had to get entree before appetizer, had to wait 3 minutes after entree came out for cutlery, and had to adjust check after being overcharged about $5. I might go back if I'm nearby and feel like Thai, but only if they aren't busy."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch recently and I'd give 5 stars for the food and 1 star for the service! I had the yellow curry lunch special and got a huge amount of food. The curry was perfectly flavored. BUT... the service was horrible! I stood at the door for about 5 mins waiting to be seated as the host looked at me but didnt say anything at all and walked away. Loved the food but I'll probably end up going to a different location and hope the service is better!"}
{"text":"i love this place! great service and an affordable lunch special. a good amount of vegan options, but you have to be careful that there is no fish sauce inside of things that may seem vegetarian yet really aren't. i really wish they'd add a little bit more vegan option to the menu, but it won't stop me from showing up. i really like their purple sticky rice, curries and veggie rolls. best thai place downtown.. hands down."}
{"text":"Service was OK, nothing exceptional. Price was fair, food good, ambiance relaxing. I will be back again when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We get take out from here frequently.  Favs are Pad Thai, Thai fried rice  and peanut curry.  It's good and does the job when we're hungry for Thai food.  I like that you can specify how spicy that you want your dishes to be since I don't like spicy but the hubs does."}
{"text":"I've always been a fan of Thai Basil. Their new location in Paradise Valley Mall next to Sears has the same great Thai food I have enjoyed at their Tempe and Downtown Phoenix locations. I honestly cannot recommend a favorite dish because you will be very satisfied from anything on their entire menu. I always start off with the spring rolls and dive into a main entrée afterwards. Call me selfish, but my main entrée is too good to share. Get your own. Just kidding. Raul has waited on us on different occasions. Raul is very courteous and very knowledgeable when it comes to the menu. Thank goodness there is a Thai  restaurant in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Don't advertise that you deliver if you're not going to have sufficient delivery staff available. After placing a $70 delivery order I receive an email informing me that they won't be able to deliver it and that I can come and pick it up instead. If I was able to pick it up I wouldn't be shelling out for a delivery fee, now would I?"}
{"text":"Wonderful food and excellent service.  We stopped in the mall to do some walking out of the 115 heat and we're very pleasantly surprised.  I had the ginger dish and wife had the spicy rice and both were wonderful."}
{"text":"I'm writing this in hopes that management/owner will be more considerate of customers/potential customers in the future... We've been to two other Thai basil locations and have had nice experiences each time so we decided to take a trip downtown to try out your location yesterday, July 3.. We first checked Google maps, then your website to confirm the hours and all said that you were open... I tried calling with a question, a few times but there was no answer (we figured you were just busy!) AND the outgoing voicemail message ALSO said that you were open... Likewise, there was NO indication on your Facebook page that anything was different about your hours this weekend... So we headed downtown, found some parking and PAID for parking then walked over to the restaurant... As we got near we could see there were no lights on, and when we came up to the door there was a simple paper sign stating that you were closed for the holiday weekend (July 2-4)!!  REALLY?!?!!  You could have made a little more effort to let that be known!!  We chose your restaurant over other restaurants, we were both very hungry and looking forward to try you out, SPENDING OUR TIME AND OUR MONEY TO GIVE YOU OUR BUSINESS, only to be greeted with a simple paper sign stating that you were closed for the weekend.  I hope that you will take notice and have more consideration for your potential future customers... DISAPPOINTING :("}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the valley! I've tried many places and many do not succeed. Check out the Green Curry with Chicken. Full of mouth watering flavors."}
{"text":"Take an uber up central to Wild Thaiger. Or go anywhere else in walking distance. Poor service, zero atmosphere and sub par food. My wife said there is no soul in here."}
{"text":"Top notch! I'm full Thai and absolutely love this place compared to trying at least ten others in valley.  The pad Thai is bomb.  The Thai Esan sausage plate is delectable. Also my fiancée looooves their take on fried rice."}
{"text":"Our waiter was really friendly and sweet. The yellow curry with extra veggies is flavorful and tasty and the BBQ chicken was nicely cooked with a tangy sauce on the side. The cute little mall location is in a convenient area."}
{"text":"Cute place, very nice inside. The people were friendly and the food wasn't bad. I wish they put more meat in the curry that we ordered. There were probably 3 strips of beef in the curry. The flavor was good, but wish there was more. The appetizers weren't bad."}
{"text":"Awful awful terrible food! How can Pad Thai taste so bad?! This is Thailand's main dish! They should be ashamed and embarrassed! Did take out never been to location and will never go back! I give 0 stars not even 1! Me calling as a new customer they should have been more aware and tried to cook a good meal. Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"First time at Thai Basil I ordered the pineapple curry with shrimp.  It wasn't on menu but they said they had it when I asked. I paid $5 to have it delivered to my house about 5 miles away.  It arrived quickly and was still piping hot.  The curry was delicious and just spicy enough (asked for level 2) to give you the heat without the burn. The dish contained a lot of tender shrimp along with bell peppers and tomatoes.  My only small complaint is that the tomatoes were mushy, I  would ask to have them omitted when I order in future.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE this restaurant. Excellent food, and service. I go here with my fiance almost every weekend. Shout out to the owner PATTY! She's such a sweetheart! It's a great place to get some kick ass Thai food. Great for romantic dinners, a girls night out, family fun night, and even just for a quick bite to eat. I love going here and will continue to keep going. My top suggestions would be the vegetable spring rolls, fresh rolls with tofu, crispy sweet potato, Thai signature dish, pot stickers or chicken noodles..... in fact.... everything is good here. GO TO THAI BASIL!"}
{"text":"Yummy Thai food. This is one of my co-workers favorite restaurants and I enjoy it also. Everything is fresh, tasty and fast. This is a great place to get lunch. I love the #5 garlic with chicken. It comes with soup or salad depending on the season, rice and an egg roll. Servers are really busy. The prices are really reasonable. I order a lot of my offices lunches here"}
{"text":"Not very authentic and pretty bland. There are better Thai places in Phoenix the only reason you should come here is if you're working near by or if it's the simplest option."}
{"text":"Do not EVER order food from here. No consistency, they do not follow requests, nor do they care. Third times a charm. And the guy who answers the phone argues with you and makes no amends for his restaurant's food. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"The drunken noodles and green curry were very good.  Nice atmosphere.  Beer selection small."}
{"text":"Thai Basil recently replaced what was Thai Pan. That explains why when we called in our \"take-out\" order to Thai Pan, the lady taking the order didn't know what we were talking about when we ordered the dishes by name.  It took a long time to order b/c she couldn't figure out what we wanted. Don't you think she'd tell us that the menu changed and the place is now Thai Basil?  Unless she said Thai Basil when she answered the phone. At any rate, we didn't know that the place changed hands until we got there. Took the food home. The flavors were decent.  We ordered Garlic stir fry from the old menu. Not sure what that translated to on the new menu. Chicken was very chewy and overcooked.  Also ordered \"Evil Jungle Princess\" from the old menu.   Flavors were similar but the shrimp was way overcooked. Haven't seen shrimp that overcooked and rubbery in a long time.  So... food must have been sitting around for a while to overcook like that.  Bottom line:  They need to get the phone ordering person more familiar with the menu, explain that they took over Thai Pan, and make the food fresh upon ordering.  Hopefully when they work out the kinks, it will be good. In the meantime, not sure I can go back. Overcooked protein is a big turn-off."}
{"text":"Food is good but that's about it. Not fond it the service or the over crowded over stuff restaurant. Service wasn't great either but would be good for take out!"}
{"text":"Drunken noodles are very good. They know what mild means. Price is about 10$ for entree and a couple more for a drink. 20$ for a great meal."}
{"text":"Got the coconut shrimp and chili garlic veggies, both excellent and the service was lightning quick!! I would come back if i'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I have always gone to Malee's for Thai food so venturing out to Thai Basil was a real gamble for me. I must say though, I was really impressed. We have only gotten takeout twice from here, but both times, all the food was really good. We ordered the Pad Thai, Thai Fried rice with Pork, Yellow Curry Chicken, and the  Sweet Nut Curry with Tofu. I liked the Pad Thai the best and my husband loved the yellow curry.  All of the items were very fresh tasting, not super greasy like some Thai places, and the prices were very reasonable. Food was ready when they said it would be and we will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I normally love coming here- the food is good quality and fresh! But I'm starting to realize they use WAY too much salt for my liking! I ordered pad Thai and Tom Ka soup. No one checked on me once to ask how the meal was and I was THE ONLY person eating at 230pm aside from a table of 6 on some food tour. There were 2 workers setting tables next to me too. I told myself I'll just ask for half the salt next time I order because I realize I'm sensitive to food. But when the waitress asked if I wanted a to-go box for nearly ALL the food left (I just picked) and I said, \"no thanks it was too salty for me!\" she gave me a puzzled look and had a weird power trip and tried to make me feel wrong for saying such a thing! She looked around with a face of sass and said, \"it's the same sauce we use on everything!\" I said, \"and it's too salty for ME, which is why I don't want to take it to go!\" She said, \"ok well maybe tell us not to put so much next time.\" Even though that's what I originally planned to do, bad customer service is never appreciated! Undecided if I'll return! I feel bad for writing such a poor review for the establishment when really just this waitress should check her attitude before going to work!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Had the #19 for lunch and a Thai tea. The food was hot and fresh and came out very quickly. Our waitress was kind, friendly and informative about the different dishes. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Easy to find parking spot around the restaurant. Very delicious drunken noodle and tum yum soup! And friendly staff too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were desperate to have a good Thai experience in new Scottsdale.  Thai basil didn't disappoint.   The pad Thai was seriously great.   Washed it down with a couple of Thai ice teas and wow what a great treat!    Highly recommended."}
{"text":"An excellent place to eat.  You must try this place. The food is fresh.  I like the spicy noodles with shrimp. Go with mild or medium spicy."}
{"text":"It's a good Thai place for lunch. Starting at around $8 for lunch. Had the pad se ewe and young coconut water. So good."}
{"text":"The first time I went I thought this place was very good, however, the second time was not as good.  The food is sort of bland, missing spices and just blah.  The portions are also a bit small when compared to other Thai restaurants.  I don't plan to go back."}
{"text":"Ordered pad Thai and it wasn't very good, it didn't seem fresh. We ordered chicken but tofu was mixed in as well. I'd be willing to try other dishes here but will not be getting pad Thai from here again. A little disappointing."}
{"text":"Raul is amazing. Great food. Great service. Super fast. I would strongly recommend the chicken pad thai."}
{"text":"ok  food i can't say it was the best i eat.   but was fine.  cheap i will say.  the place look  fine.  i may  go there again,  but its not one of those places that i will  definitely go ."}
{"text":"The smells in this place are amazing. This has become the go to place that resembles a somewhat healthier option than my pizza and Chinese take out addiction. I will defiantly want to hit this place up before any event at chase field or if the suns are ever decent enough to see.   My first visit I did an sweet and sour chicken with a side of rice. Huge portion that last most of dinner and most of lunch the next day. Next time was loosing my pad Thai virginity. Now I didn't study abroad for 6 weeks in some god awful green peace program on Thailand...so I am not an authority on if this is \"authentic\".....but honestly, if you are hungry and like tasty goodness then this place will make you happy. So drop the cartel coffee and your thrift store copy of \"animal farm\" and just eat.   Additionally, the main waitress has remembers when we come in and insists we sit at \"our table\". Cute as hell."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before but felt so strongly about our recent visit here that i found it necessary to download the app just for this review.   The service was awful. No one seated us. There was only one server for the restaurant and he wasn't able to handle it even though there were only 3 tables at any given time. He was unfocused and needed us to repeat ourselves several times. He never checked in on us or refilled our waters. They also neglected to clear any tables after people left, leaving loads of dirty plates and trash sitting there for the duration of our meal.  We loved the potstickers and dipping sauce but other food was awful. I ordered the grilled seafood (an $18 entree). The calamari was inedible, the fish, mussels, and shrimp were way overcooked. The \"salad\" was large torn pieces of unwashed romaine without dressing. My husband ordered curry noodles that he described as \"disgusting\". The curry was watery and the chicken seemed to be haphazardly cooked. This dish had the appropriate spice but was swimming in coconut milk and lacked the actual curry spice.  Needless to say, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy when we were there for dinner on a Sunday night (which we took to be a good sign). We ordered fresh rolls with tofu, they were flavorless and the peanut sauce was just ok. For entrees we had the Thai basil and phad Thai But the food had a weird smell. The phad Thai was different than what I usually consider phad Thai to be. The Thai basil had good flavors if you can get past the smell. The kitchen was playing loud rap music and could be heard pretty easily and kind of ruined the ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant. They had lime in the water which gave it a refreshing flavor."}
{"text":"Could I give someone 0 stars? I just made a yelp account so I could inform others on how terrible the service is here. Phenomenal food. I've come here for years, even before it opened and when Thai Pan was here. It used to be moderate service, but over the past few years it's been declining more and more. As of tonight, the restaurant was empty except for two tables and they had 3 people working in the front. Two of which were 12 years old. My family called and ordered takeout and said what we usually said and they didn't understand it whatsoever. I went in hoping they didn't mess up, again. It took another 15 minutes and once I got my food, I noticed two of the dishes was nothing like what I ordered. I politely told them they made the incorrect meal and if I could get the correct one. They then told me that I would have to pay ANOTHER $23.10 to make my correct dish, since they thought I was the one who messed up. It's so tragic they don't know how to operate a restaurant and they will be losing my family's service for the rest of the time they're open (which won't be for long)."}
{"text":"I went here the other night and the waiter was very giggly. The food was tolerable but not the best Thai food I have ever had. Some one at our table ordered chicken fried rice but it did not have the veggies in it and lacked flavor."}
{"text":"I visited one night while on a business trip and walked over at 8:15pm. The guy at the bar told me they closed the kitchen already and said I couldn't order anything. They close at 9pm. The green curry is good, but Tom Yum one block over got our business for the rest of the week. It's too bad."}
{"text":"Dirty restroom and out of toilet paper before our meal. Didn't stick around to see if they treat their kitchen the same way."}
{"text":"This is our go-to Source for yummy take out Thai flavors.  They are fast, food is hot and people are friendly. Curries are flavorful and good veggies. The fresh rolls are better than other places."}
{"text":"My husband and I go here as it's close to home.  I've never had a bad meal and we've always had great service.  I love the coconut soup and have tried most of the curry dishes--all good.  They never disappoint me.  My husband always gets the Pad Thai and loves it.  I like that it's family owned, which is so rare these days."}
{"text":"Underwhelming at best. We happened to be at PV Mall on Black Friday, and I took my little sister here for some Thai food. While my green curry was decent, and the 3/5 spicy was just right, there were large pieces of mint leaf in the curry. I accidentally bit into one of them, and I think my breath is still fresh a week later.   My sister's pad thai on the other hand was terrible. It was bland, and the noodles were undercooked or something. She ordered the pork pad thai, and I think that she got more tofu than pork (she does like tofu, and so do I, but not when I order and pay for pork!)  On top of that, service was minimal. I think I sat with an empty glass for most of the meal, and we had to wait a decent length of time before they brought us a check  All in all, there are plenty of other Thai places with as good or better food that are nearer to me. I will not be going here again."}
{"text":"I wrote one of the first reviews of this place, and it got filtered so I guess I'm not trustworthy! Oh well! :)  In any case, I live right around the corner from this restaurant so I do take out from here once or twice a week.    I continue to like this place very much, and much more than the old Thai restaurant that had been there for years.   I especially like the red curry, but my two favorite dishes are their signature Thai Basil and their Garlic and Eggplant dishes."}
{"text":"If I don't want to cook I can always count on Thai Basil! The coconut curry dish and bbq chicken are our favorites! My kids love when I come home with food from here. One kid loves there side order of chicken in a secret sauce and the other kid loves rice noodles in a secret sauce... No matter which chef is working both know who I am and make my kids there dishes exactly how they like it! Thank you"}
{"text":"I enjoy all the offerings here! And Raul is a great waiter! A must if you like Thai food!  And if you haven't had Thai food,  a must to try!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. I live nearby and walk over every few weeks. Penang Curry is my fav and they don't disappoint. Soups... YES    The only complaint I would have is this: I typically dine solo and order appetizer, soup and entree.  I have a few bites of each and expect to take the rest home as leftovers. They always pack everything in small styrofoam container which would not be able to hold half of what I had left. They're throwing away MY food to save costs on to go containers."}
{"text":"Delicious food. We ordered the Panang curry and the masaman curry and it was wonderful. My niece was raised in Thailand and in her opinion the Thai basil restaurants are the closest she has found. I highly recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"I've tried a bunch of Thai places around town, and even around the country, but this one wins every time. And because it's so close to home, I just feel like belting out Sound of Music's \"I must have done something good\". I'm a creature of habit so I tend to order my favorites (Pad Thai and Green Curry) every single time. Everyone raves about the taste when they try it. How do you solve a problem like finding good Thai food? Try Thai Basil."}
{"text":"Very good flavorful food. Great for lunch. Comes with some soup or small salad. Everything we tried was delicious. Generous serving.  I took 3 girlfriends there and they all enjoyed it. I like how you cam select meat or protein and dish. Even the tofu is prepared tastes so good. We will be regulars."}
{"text":"Great location, great food, great atmosphere. Loved the Pad Thai! Staff was a little slow even for a slow night but the food helped them."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service here. Get the red thai curry, it was perfectly flavored with mild heat. Also good was the thai basil which we ordered with chicken. Good service as well. Will come here again!"}
{"text":"I always get the same meal and enjoy it every time. I always get the Pha Nang (Spelling?) I always add the spiced diced peppors for that special flavor served from a side tray."}
{"text":"I called for a take out order and asked for Mango and sticky rice. The gentleman on the phone said ok, but that might delay the order about 30 minutes. I said ok, as I was picking it up on my way home, that was no problem. I get the food, go home, and we open our mango/sticky rice and there are two TINY slivers. Ok, I mean TINY- I added a photo of what they gave us- look at the photos. I've ordered this before and it usually comes with a half of a mango each serving. He should have said they were out or it was out of season OR SOMETHING. This is ridiculous and they charged us 30 dollars for mediocre pineapple rice and two mango sticky rices without any mango. Terrible ethics. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"I am visiting Phoenix and decided to have dinner at this restaurant one night because it was close to my hotel. The food was ok and the service was also ok. Nothing to write home about but acceptable. The portion was a bit on the small side, but the food came out really fast! So if you are looking for a quick bite to eat and you are not that picky, this may be your spot.   HOWEVER, do NOT go there if they are busy. I went back a day later with a friend and colleague for lunch, and because of a conference that is was in town, the restaurant was packed. I understand that it is hard to provide good service when it is busy, BUT even accounting for that, the service was really unacceptable. First of all, they put a glass of ice in front of us. Not water with ice, but literally a glass ice with a thimble full of water. We couldn't drink anything out of the glass and so we asked if they could dump the ice and give us some water The waiter actually said no!! He said he was too busy to do that. I was speechless. Then they brought our main meal, which came out fast, but we did not get our soup. We had to ask for it twice and when it arrived, one person only had some lukewarm broth. The spring roll was also lukewarm and soggy. All in all, it was NOT a very satisfying meal. Then they brought the check on our table when we had barely started eating!! I am giving this place two stars because my experience in the evening was ok, but I would give them no stars for lunch."}
{"text":"Great place! Our favorite is the chicken peanut curry, my husband and I split it everytime!! Awesome service too!"}
{"text":"The food really took longer than 20 mins since the time we place an order.  Pad see yew was a bit salty and half of my plate was full of onions.  The portion is small compared to other Thai Restaurant."}
{"text":"This place has always been hit or miss and lately it's been a miss, three times in a row now we've had really disappointing food. I think it's time to break up with Thai Basil. I have to wonder if this place is under new ownership as the quality of food has gone so far downhill. Today we ordered Fresh Spring Rolls, Yellow Chicken Curry and Rama Chicken. Both main dishes were the worst Thai dishes I've ever had. The vegetables were all undercooked and the sauces were REALLY watery. A properly prepared curry should be creamy and should NEVER have crunchy onions; that's a sure sign that the curry was hastily thrown together. The Spring Rolls were no better. How can anyone screw up a fresh spring roll? There are two rolls to an order and each roll only comes with ONE shrimp. Yes, you heard me right...one measly shrimp in each roll. So, if you want to taste shrimp in more than one bite you have to pay extra for what is the normal amount of shrimp in every spring roll made in every other Thai restaurant on the planet...they don't even slice the shrimp, they just throw them in there whole. The worst part was that they use is BAGGED SALAD MIX for the greens. In my opinion using a musty bagged salad mix in a Thai Spring Roll is a crime against humanity. In fact, no restaurant should use BAGGED SALAD MIX!!! So the rolls are basically filled with disgusting bagged salad mix, a few bean sprouts, rice noodles and a sad little shrimp...no Cilantro or Mint! What's more, the rolls are advertised as coming with peanut sauce, but actually the sauce is a soy ginger sauce...if you ask for actual peanut sauce they up charge. Oh, yes, and if you want brown rice instead of jasmine rice that's an up charge as well. Seriously, don't go here. This restaurant deserves to die on the vine if they can't get their act together."}
{"text":"As someone who has had Thai food all over the world this place is by far the Worst Thai food ever. Service was ungodly slow and in attentive. The food came out cold and without and flavor. If I could give this place a 0 I would. Save your money and eat else where."}
{"text":"I've ate the majority of the menu and I enjoy it all. The plates feel fresh and fairly healthy. I've also been to various locations in the valley and find them to be consistent. The Thai iced tea is a delicious creamy one. For the price and style of food that you don't normally eat everyday as an American, I highly recommend this chain."}
{"text":"So I get that when you order from UberEATS places tend to half ass their orders, but this is terrible. I ordered a yellow chicken curry, and it was just liquid with maybe six carrots and one piece of chicken. The sauce tasted fine but I didn't pay $15 for sauce!"}
{"text":"So wonderful! I used yelp to help me find a Thai restaurant that delivers and boy did it deliver. I had the pot stickers and red chili curry, kang dang.  Couldn't put the curry away. Best I've had in az. Pot stickers were tasty too. Next time I will get steamed instead of fried. The fried were good, but pot stickers are better steamed. Thank you Thai Basil!"}
{"text":"Very good food served fast but fresh and a good value. Seating is a little tight but would return for sure."}
{"text":"C and I enjoyed dinner before a play with another couple at Thai Basil on Adams. The location was easy to find and the interior was very well decorated! We were greeted promptly and we'll attended to poo ur entire experience. The staff wasn't very well versed on the drink menu, but that was fine! They actually had a pretty extensive drink menu compared to other authentic thai places.  We ordered the combination appetizer plate to share. This had some sort of chicken skewers, fried tofu, egg rolls, wontons and sweet potato pancakes with a variety of dipping sauces. Everything was pretty good, but the variety of hor dourves was really what made it great!  I ordered the thai green curry with tofu and my fiancée had the chicken pad thai. Both hot, but not thai hot (which I always assume is code word for pain). My curry was fabulous. Creamy and flavorful only made better by the hearty serving of vegetables and steamed tofu (my fav) swimming in it. C was very pleased with his pad thai and we both cleaned our plates, even though the servings were quite generous. I would absolutely recommend it and return myself!"}
{"text":"It was my turn to find a place for dinner, and since I'm always on the search for delicious Thai food I turned to our fellow Yelpers for recommendations and came upon Thai Basil.   The four of us (my gf, her bf and my bf) arrived just around dinner to a cozy restaurant. We ordered our drinks and we decided each of us would order a dish.  We started with spring rolls and dumplings, and for our mains: drunken chicken noodles, BBQ thai sausage, cashew nuts with veggies & beef and a red thai curry. Since they weren't family style dishes, the non-noodle dishes came with sides of rice so that worked out great for us.   Everything was really delicious and flavourful! The spices weren't overwhelming and portions were really hearty.  I definitely agree with positive reviews of this place, some of the best Thai food I've had :)"}
{"text":"Food is ok, but the service is so bad I can't believe they're still in business. The last time I went here, I called four times to pre-order my take out. No answer. I stopped by anyway and was told it would be 45 minutes to get my order, so I left.  Just now, I called again, no answer. I stopped by to eat in, closed for an hour. Maybe put that on your voice message so people don't waste their time? That lost me for good. Plenty of other Thai restaurants to eat at."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food.  The green curry is absolutely addictive.  We've been there several times and every dish I've tried has been outstanding.  I've always found the service to be good and the wait staff to be friendly and efficient. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The worst and most disgusting food ever. The crispy noodles were smothered with extremely sweet yuck sauce. Pad Thai tasted like card Baird. And they are expensive. This I wouldn't eat if someone paid me to eat. Save your money and your taste buds. Stay away!"}
{"text":"i have  only eaten in this place once...i usually call in for takeout cause it's walking distance form the office. i think this is the best thai food in phoenix. they make it to order...so if there's something you don't want in your curry (i'm allergic to onions) they can make it for you without the offending ingredient. the prices are great and so is the service. i recommend the panang and massaman curries."}
{"text":"Nasty, salty, old, sick food. The smell in there is so weird and on top of that there food is so nasty that I don't have words. I spent thirty dollars on some of the nastiest pad Thai you will ever taste. Don't waste your time or money in this place!!"}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant while on vacation. Was very happy with service and food. Would definitely go back if I lived in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I am from out of town and this place has the best Red Curry I have tasted. It has just a hint of spicy just the way I like. (I asked for not spicy because it usually is to much for me.) The service was professional and my food arrived pretty quickly. I would recommend this place again."}
{"text":"Real good Pad Thai!! Curry dish was enjoyed greatly as well....just needs more outdoor seating"}
{"text":"Great Thai food. Happy to have a good Thai restaurant around here. The chicken pad Thai & Yellow curry (hot) were perfect! The Thai ice tea was soothing. Service was good too. Yay for Thai food!!!!!"}
{"text":"The one decent thing was the pot stickers. If it is a weekend., don't bother ordering off their special board that is placed outside of the entrance. Apparently that is only good during the week. Not sure why they put it out to order from then. Thought that was a bit deceiving. Don't bother ordering anything spicy hot. It all comes out mild. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken pad Thai and I thought it was pretty good. It was a mix of sweet, peanutty, sour, and spicy. I'm not sure that it's my absolute favorite dish, but I am definitely going back because there are so many things on the menu I haven't discovered."}
{"text":"If you are just one person they will put you in the worst seating. Even when I politely asked for other seating I was refused. Ah well- GREAT sushi next door."}
{"text":"I love Thai Basil. It's located near metered parking, light rail, and parking garages. The food is really good and I've never had a problem with customer service, but I eat at odd times of the day. My favorite items are the spring rolls, sweet potato appetizer, and the MILD green curry with chicken. Their cheesecake is not very flavorful but does come with mango sauce. It's on the pricey side, but it's downtown and the food is super."}
{"text":"This used to be one of the best Thai restaurants around.  New owners...ummmm nothing to write home about.  Ordered to go... I ordered Panang Beef SPICY, Fresh Rolls, and asked for kids Teriyaki.  No kids MENU~~~ not cool $9 for Teriyaki Chicken for a 4 year old.  It was very, very dry.  Fresh Rolls....lettuce and pad thai noodles inside.  Hoison sauce, not sweet chile or peanut sauce... and an x-tra $1 to have shrimp(which is standard).  Gross.... Panang was CHICKEN not Beef and mild.  Sad :("}
{"text":"Excellent food and great customer service. I come here frequently and always enjoy the food. Amazing food and friendly staff"}
{"text":"Got food off Uber eats from here, it was alright. Being from Seattle I might be picky when it comes to Thai food. There wasn't much flavor but great portions."}
{"text":"I was swayed by some of the  good reviews and decided to try this place and ordered Thai basil beef in medium heat, hot sour soup, hot; pad thai noodles and mee krob. Hot sour soup was just greasy, Thai basil beef was just so-so, veggies were over cooked, all mushy (yuck), pad Thai was ok, I've had better but OMG!! The mee krob was just gross. Either it was cooked using a very old rancid oil or the noodle itself was old and rancid. I smelled it and tasted it, just because I couldn't believe my nose that it is rancid, yep had to taste it and almost barfed, had get a shot of tequila to sanitize my mouth. :( You bet ya I'll never go back there  again. Yuck."}
{"text":"Thai Basil signature has truly excellent food ! I have had numerous menu items and all were prepared with fresh ingredients , lots of flavor and not too much cooking oil in the preparation . My husband was born and raised in Taiwan and we know good Asian food . This is a real treat !"}
{"text":"I love this place for Thai Food as it's the best in downtown Phoenix.   Every employee is incredibly friendly and the food is fantastic.   Also, I have tried EVERY Thai Basil location in the valley and the downtown location is on another level of greatness! Seriously, the BEST THAI in DT Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Luv this place. They give a salad that has a light dressing. The food tastes amazing. Quick service"}
{"text":"Ordered Fresh rolls with shrimp as that or tofu were only options. The shrimp was very fishy! It came with hoisin sauce instead of Thai chili and peanut sauces. Ordered Tom Yum, had big chunks of tomato and tons of shredded lemongrass to bite into, not cool!!! Won't be back!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious, but wasn't enough to make up for the bad service. We showed the waitress the coupon on Yelp for the free spring rolls; we ordered 4 dinner entrées. To qualify for the free spring rolls, you only needed 3 dinner entrées.   First, the server said the manager wasn't aware of the coupon.  She claimed we needed to have a confirmation code by printing out the offer to get the free spring rolls. When you click on the coupon, it just attempts to dial out to the restaurant. You can't print it out. Don't try to use that coupon. We got charged for the spring rolls.    You aren't greeted by anyone when you come in. In order to get seated, you have to go to the hostess stand that's hidden on the side of the restaurant. We were seated for about 15 min before anyone paid attention to us. It took way too long for our food to come out after we placed our order. I asked for extra eggplant but didn't get it.   The place wasn't busy at all. The server never refilled our glasses either even though it was clear we needed more water. But then again, she only checked up on us twice during our meal. The second time was when she dropped off our check.   In short, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, food quality is very good and service is attentive - never had a poor experience..  Overall 75% of our food has been \"carry out\" and here's the trick for the guys - dont phone in your orders.... Instead,  order food on arrival and my experience has shown that the food is always ready when you have that last swig of Kirin beer.. Can't beat it they have down to a fine art.... See you there on a monday around 6-15pm :)  Diddy"}
{"text":"A friend suggested this restaurant and so had lunch there today. What a pleasant surprise! I had a delicious Chicken Cashew dish that was wonderful, not spicy as requested, and my friends enjoyed their meals too.  Too bad the patio misters weren't on or umbrellas set up as there's a lovely view of Camelback Mtn from the restaurant.  We'll be back to try happy hour soon."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and live in a cold climate. We asked the host if we could sit outside. The waitress and host shook their heads disapprovingly and begrudgingly began to set our table.  We felt extremely unwelcomed so we left.  I highly recommend avoiding this place. The staff is rude and alarmingly callous. The restaurant was empty inside on a Friday night.  Now we know why.  I will spend a lot of energy persuading everyone I know to not spend a penny at this dump. Shame on management. Shame on staff."}
{"text":"Cute little place with a great atmosphere. Food was delish...the only problem was finding our waiter for drink refills."}
{"text":"Really hurts to write this review.  For a year now, every time I go for lunch in downtown, I end up at Harumi Sushi next door.  Noticed this was a \"signature\" Thai basil, so I wanted to try it one day.  I expected it to be better than the normal Thai Basil locations which are usually pretty good.  Walked in, sat down, put an order in for Pad See Ew with beef to go. Was excited and couldn't wait to dig in when I got back to the office.  First impression, the food looked, inadequate.  Didn't see enough noodles.  Took a bite, and the beef was very chewy, and the flavors were sub par - heavy on the sweet side which I did not expect.  Was starving so ate the little portion and finished with a disappointed and unfulfilled feeling and a bad after taste.  It's the worst experience I've had recently.  I have to assume that every Thai Basil is run completely independently.  This location ruins the brand.  Will go to the other locations but never back to this one."}
{"text":"The food is so good and very reasonably priced! my fiance and i both love the panang curry so much we each get our own every time (basically weekly) and havent been able to try many other menu items yet!"}
{"text":"I went with a group of friends last night before a show at the Orpheum Got there at 5:30 and was seated right away Our orders were taken quickly The food took a while to come out and did not come out together and one item never came. Asked for an extra spoon and bowl and it never came Our waiter never came back to see us I asked at the bar for a cup of tea and was told he was very busy and could not get it for me Asked for the check from across the room and they never came back to the table with it After 7 pm we finally went to leave and stopped at the register and he immediately told us how much we owed but didn't present the bill It was about what we thought it was paid and left Under staffed Poor service Food was okay"}
{"text":"Food was good but nothing extra special. Portions were good. Service though wasn't great. They never refilled water or came to the table after serving us."}
{"text":"My newest best place to eat at. Flavors are high in deliciouness and very friendly waiter/ waitress."}
{"text":"Service was fine.  Not spectacular, but not bad either if your craving Thai food in the area b/c there isn't much around.  Prices are standard.  Lunch portion a little small but not too the point that you feel like it's not worth it."}
{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible. Their hours say 9 p.m. and we came in at 8:10 p.m. and they Buddhist out of the restaurant and say they've been busy all day and clothes and refused to serve us do not go here go across the street to tom yum."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for Thai and/or cheat night. They are always very friendly and have the best lunch specials. Their chicken noodle dish is amazing, as is their Thai iced tea, which isn't overly sweet as I've experienced in other places. My daughter asked to try their chicken wings, which I was hesitant to order but they were REALLY good. They were pretty large with just the right amount of seasoning- and not spicy at all...good for kids. Their panang curry is rich and delicious. They always sub extra vegetables for rice when I wish to steer clear of starchy carbs. I have yet to venture to other entrees on the menu but I will get to it. As should you!"}
{"text":"Great Thai, Great Prices and very nice staff.  I have been here multiple times for lunch.  It's a hit with our office!"}
{"text":"We keep trying this place for takeout and the food just keeps getting worse. Pad Thai has no taste. There seems to have been a big staff turnover. There used to be Thai people actually working there. Now we don't see any. Looking for good Thai in town!"}
{"text":"I really liked the red curry. What I didn't expect is to be charged $1.50 for extra rice. Really? The sauce is twice what they give you for rice. That really irked me. When I asked for rice, he should have had the decency to let me know they charged extra for it. I have never had that occur before. Probably because rice is like 8 cents a pound. (Exaggerating, but c'mon man) Solution: give more than one cup of rice with a dish that is primarily sauce.  Based on that, it will be sometime before we are going back there."}
{"text":"I had the pineapple curry with shrimp. The food tasted great and the service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Definitely 1 of the nicest and best restaurants I've ate at in arizona.  Conveniently located in front of the light rail. The food is absolutely delicious a bit on the  pricy side. The workers cook great food very polite and understanding  and they cook the food quick its a great location for families and a romantic dinner.  I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is a staple in my book. Whether it's take out when I want to go home or dine in when I have more time, I always call ahead to order or check in to see how busy they are. My husband and I always enjoy their tangy hot & sour soup and delicious coconut soup! My favorite dish is their garlic eggplant, a MUST each time I order and my husbands fav is their beef salad, the dressing is delicious! We always bring our guests who enjoy their curries and noodles. Their Thai tea is sweet and aromatic.   When they get busy dine in, just please be patient with the staff. Delicious food takes time!   Thank you all for working hard and being there to feed us!"}
{"text":"This is a great Thai spot right in downtown! You'll find the Drunken noodles to be a go-to option, as it's packed with flavor and veggies like onion, bell pepper and tomato. Lunch times are always packed, but they bring the food out so fast that it makes for a quick turnover!  Services has definitely improved, you'll always find friendly faces here and warm service!!"}
{"text":"Keep coming back!! The steamed potstickers and red curry Thai hot!! Nom nom nom!"}
{"text":"Had the Drunken noodles for lunch. Food was great service was quick and price was excellent."}
{"text":"OMG!! This place is awful!!! Smells like rancid oil day and night. The cook keeps going out the front door and smoking cigarettes which is almost a blessing cause it drowns out the rancid oil. And cockroaches... Don't get me started! BE AFRAID... BE VERY AFRAID!!!"}
{"text":"We happened to eat here because Noodle Bar (next door) was closed. We're glad we found it, it was delicious! I had the \"drunken\" noodles which were very tasty...the service was great too!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch and the service was great. A friend ordered tofu Thai basil spicy but it came out mild. I ordered green curry spicy and it was spicy and yummy. The green curry wasn't out of this world but respectable: would try this place again."}
{"text":"Love the food! I had the sweet and sour pork sautéed with veggies. Although the waiters were rude the food makes up for that. I definitely recommend this place to my friends and family. I gave it three stars because the waiters were a little rude."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices and they are fast for that worker on lunch break. Worth a try. I had the Green curry and it was really good."}
{"text":"We love the food and the owner is extremely nice and made sure everything was done just right. Have and will return many times. Great service!"}
{"text":"YUMMM!!!! Their signature salad with their notorious dressing is fantastic. The Thai Tea is huge and delish, Spring rolls are on point & couldn't leave without trying the coconut soup! Did not disappoint. Service is good and place is clean. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We're not Thai experts, but we know what we like and we really liked this. We'll definitely be back. We ate early, 5pm, so there weren't many there yet 10 people, but 5 came in for take out in the short time we were there. Someone knows something and we can't argue. We'll update this when we're more experienced.......and, the service was great"}
{"text":"My family and I always come to this restaurant when we are in the mood for some good Thai food. They are awesome for ordering to go but they also provide good service in the restaurant itself.   Rama's favorite and drunken noodles are our go to dishes that are \"must haves\" for us. They definitely don't go light on the spice you can order from a range of 1-5. I like spicy but a 1 is good enough for me. If you really really like spicy spicy food then go for a 5. My dad orders his as a 5 and isn't disappointed.   We tried the coconut soup and it was amazing! Great flavor and exactly what we wanted.   I got a jasmine tea and was not impressed, didn't have much flavor. I would stick to the traditional Thai tea in the future."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken noodle on their lunch specials. It was good and satisfying. Highly recommed the egg rolls! I ordered an extra one just because it was so good :)"}
{"text":"First time here Yellow curry is great! The potatoes were undercooked but still was great overall!  I will visit again!!!:) I love this place!! I service was good!"}
{"text":"We had the sweet nut curry and grilled chicken dishes and enjoyed both a lot. The curry had a delicious and unique sauce and the grilled chicken dish had a coconut flavor and three large pieces of chicken on vegetables. Service was good and very friendly, very nice atmosphere. Will be back."}
{"text":"Meh. Some good dishes. Nice salad to start. Pad Thai is not great. Just noodles, egg and whatever meat. No veg. No crunch."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is less than 5 minutes from my house, which is great news. The food is solid, but the best part this restaurant is the Manager, Raul. I walked in minutes before they were shutting down, but was welcomed with open arms. I was the only customer in the joint, yet no one rushed me out or made me as if I were inconveniencing them. In a city where non one wants to work, it was a pleasure to find a staff that enjoys their workplace--even when cleaning up."}
{"text":"Just had my first meal at Thai Basil at Paradise Valley Mall. Excellent service. I.ordered their Signature House dish with shrimp. The waiter asked \"how spicy would you like from 1 to 5?  I said \"2 to 3.\" The meal contained fresh vegetables and the shrimp in a very tasty sauce - just perfect on the mild spicy scale that I requested. The dish was accompanied by a nice bowl of rice.   I will definitely be coming back! Delicious! I think I want to try different dishes on their menu, but this was so good it is tempting to have it over again.   The restaurant was very clean. You have your choice of sitting outside or inside.  I recommend this restaurant to all."}
{"text":"I had a worst experience... They failed to attend us initially n later for everything including spoon n fork n tissue we had to call them n ask for it.. About the quality it was worst...please don't dare to try.. It's waste of money n tym..."}
{"text":"Thai Basil used to be my favorite local restaurant until they changed from \"Thai Pan\" to Thai Basil, (a local chain). After several months under the new ownership the food was excellent but then they began to cheapen and \"bland\" their food. My last two dinners there were terrible. Regretfully I've taken them off my togo and eat in list."}
{"text":"The worst thai food I ever had. We have to change the chowmain dish to drunken meal due  its taste like desert  instead of food. Its either they use lot of sugar or low quality increadients. Drunken meal had more tomatos then noodles . I also ssw first time in my lufe tomato in thai food. Veg was raw ss well . Service also not good at all . Very dissapointed"}
{"text":"I have carried out from here a few times now and am impressed with the quality and consistency of the food.   I ordered the Spicy Noodles with Chicken again last night -  and it was just as delicious as the last time.  Plenty of chucks of white meet chicken and the noodles were cooked to perfection. Their ability to actually \"dial down\" the spice to mild is amazing unlike other Thai restaurants were ordering \"mild\" and having it taste mild (and not something more Hot) is a crap shoot...   Another favorite dish of mine is the Red Curry with tofu.  They include plenty of Tofu chunks that are NOT overcooked which is more often the case and a hazard that tofu eaters are well aware of.  Since I have not eaten in the restaurant I am unable to comment on the table service although the take out process has always been a good experience.  They take your order, repeat it back to you and its ready when they say its.  Always a friendly smile and thank you when you pick it up.  I did notice a banner indicating delivery so I will definitely give that a try next time."}
{"text":"Dishes were excellent.  Small place and close to our downtown hotel."}
{"text":"Very small seating area. Showed up at lunch and it was packed so we got our food to go. I went with chicken thai basil at 4 stars but it was closer to a 2-3. Would recommend for those in the area."}
{"text":"Food was good. We tried the combo appetizer, red curry, and pineapple curry. The location was nice. The reason for the mid grade rating is for the service. They were very slow, unresponsive, and generally unfriendly. We won't be returning anytime soon. There are so many other options for Thai food in the valley."}
{"text":"Food was really good. We had the chicken satay, red curry and ginger chicken. Service was beyond horrible. They were not busy and we waited over 30 min for our food.  They barely gave us enough rice to begin with and charged us a 1.50 for more. Won't ever be going back here."}
{"text":"Food came out VERY quickly and was great! Red curry was super delicious and even had broccoli and squash along with other veggies. Lunch special is a wonderful price, soup was tasty and the egg roll was extra crispy. Only bad part was the soda was flat. This was a great place though!"}
{"text":"Always enjoy the green curry. Caliente!!! Not sure what the Thai word would be. Kind of surprised by some of the negative posts."}
{"text":"Very flavorful dishes. Lunch hour on Friday was very slow, so the service was remarkably fast and courteous! The pad Thai noodles had a slightly off odor and flavor... Everything else was great. Further thought, I had to drop a star due to the pad Thai noodles."}
{"text":"Don't order the seafood salad, it doesn't come with much for the price. Instead get the grilled seafood! Has a ton of fish, calamari, shrimp, scallops and also comes with veggies."}
{"text":"Overall it was ok.  Quick service for lunch but small portions. Reasonably priced and friendly service. Food is so-so."}
{"text":"In their defense, the pad see ew and the yellow curry are decent, very average. everything else we've tried was bad. and i mean real bad. greasy, over fried, and just a general poor quality. I would order to go for a pasta dish (but only because it's the only thai place near me) but wouldn't try anything else on the menu."}
{"text":"I ordered take out last night and when we got there she tells us this huge total and says \" and we no have cashews.\" The name of my dish was the cashew nuts. I don't see how you sell a dish without the main ingredient. Not even an offer for a reduced price. My husband ordered the Thai pasta and the flavor, when we both tested it was out right disgusting. We tossed in the garbage. I gave it two stars because I really like the peanut dip they give you with the combo appetizer. I don't think we will ever be back though."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night for a bite before a show. The food was actually flavorless. I've never had bad Thai food before. It was really disappointing.   And the place was understaffed. They were nice but super busy and a little forgetful.  So whoever is managing the place is struggling, sorry to say.  We had just the spring rolls and the fried tofu. No good."}
{"text":"Great Thai food in a cool part of the city with lots of lights and buildings in the area. The waitress was really nice. She adjusted our tables after I put two of them together and one of them wasn't leveled. She got on her knees and adjusted each table leg down to the correct size.  The menu had plenty of items to choose from. I don't think I've ever seen that many curry options. I ended up getting the red curry tofu and told them to make it really spicy.  It tasted amazing! There was a few beverages I wanted to try but didn't get a chance to order them. I'll try the mango smoothie and Thai iced tea next time. I'm hoping the mango smoothie is similar to the mango lassi at Indian restaurants. My fiance had allergies she didn't mention to the server such as peanuts and tofu. When we got our plates her dish had tofu in it and the server exchanged it without giving us a hassle. Later on she realized her sauce had peanuts in it and that was replaced as well without any issues. We had a great experience and will be coming back. The restaurant looks really nice and clean. If you want Thai food and you're in the area this place is an easy choice and no brainer."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service. The waitress messed up my order and then had the nerve to say that it was my fault. I ordered a red curry tofu and she gave me a chicken red curry instead. I'm a vegetarian and would never order a dish that wasn't vegetarian. I also remember clearly saying tofu twice. Maybe this waitress just isnt cut out for the job. She should have apologized instead of saying that I didnt say tofu. I was outraged about this since it took forever to even get a waitress to my table. We waited like 8 minutes at a table and I had to go to a waitress in order to even get her to come to our table. They gave me uncooked brown rice but my girl's rice was fine oddly. I had originally ordered a thai iced tea but after my meal was redone properly, like 30 minutes after i ordered it, it was still not brought to my table. I approached the waitress about it and she acted like it was a new order. She needs to start taking notes cause her memory is horrible. I've come here before and had a good exerience but after tonight I dont think im coming back here unless they fire the waitress that served me. I believe the waitress's name was Lydia. I had to get up several times during my visit  just to get what i wanted and I find this completely unprofessional. I complained to a different worker after asking for the manager but that worker said the manager wasnt around but that maybe she could help me. I told her everything that happened and she apologized for the original waitress and offered one of us a complimentary scoop of ice cream served by the waitress that we had just complained about so it probably came with some saliva in it. I turned down the offer but my girl accepted it. The only thing that could have prevented this 1 star review would be either a discount off of our check for the original waitress messing up our valentines dinner or for her to simply apologize or get fired. The lady I complained to was nice but not nice enough to make up for what our horrible waitress had put us through. I don't think I'm ever coming here again."}
{"text":"The services for the food came out in three different times and waited quite a while in between the service and I had the salad and my food came out last  I also had a shrimp salad and only two pieces of shrimp in it and it was called the papaya salad and there was no papaya and i kept digging and digging for the papaya - we eat a lot of Asian food and my husband agreed there was nothing special about his curry shrimp dinner The sushi place next door was so full we couldn't get in the front door so we went next-door to this basil Thai place because we had somewhere we had to be in an hour and a half - at least it was quiet and we could talk to each other because there were not that many people in there - we were not impressed Do not plan to go back"}
{"text":"I love Thai food! Every time I'm a new city I just have to try the Thai food and compare. This is located in downtown Phoenix. My fiancé and I went for lunch. We were both pretty impress with the food. It was very good. I asked for extra spicy and yes it was spicy. So if you are not into spicy things I recommend you ask for mild. I will for sure go back, if I'm in Phoenix again."}
{"text":"We ordered and there was a mix up with the order getting to the restaurant. We called and the restaurant took full ownership of the issue, corrected everything and sent the food the next day at the time we requested. The food was delicious too.  This is a good honest business and I would happily order again and give them my business. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Great service, atmosphere, food & desert were amazing!  Had veggie rolls, duck curry and banana ice cream , so yummy in my tummy"}
{"text":"Placed an order to go. Staff was very nice. Ordered the curry noodles with chicken. Was soooo good! It was a little soupy, but I would have loved to take the extra sauce home to put over some rice and chicken. Very feeling too."}
{"text":"Really good, fast delivery, fresh and tasty Thai!  The fish cakes and curry are really good.  We also had a noodle dish with chicken and a pork dish.  Excellent customer service.  So happy to have a Thai place that delivers!  Have not dined onsite, so cannot comment about that."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times and it continues to satisfy me. If the portions were a little bigger, it would be more of a common place to go to."}
{"text":"I love the Thai Basil restaurants in the area. The food is presented nicely and it is delicious. This particular location is at the Paradise Valley mall and is brand new. The service is great, although I don't particularly like one of the servers due to some attitude he served instead of my meal-- but that is forgivable, he seemed like he was overwhelmed that day. Regardless, the food is really great, the restaurant is clean, and the place gives you a good vibe when you walk in! Good Thai if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Their food is good! They have nice vegan and vegetarian options but no longer offer coconut milk Thai tea. The thing is that the waiters aren't very attentive. My BF and I had to get up three times because we needed something. Come on this isn't fast food.."}
{"text":"The food had great flavor and the atmosphere was really nice. I do have a qualm or two with the food, it was really heavy on the oil and having a love of Thai food it was not what I was used to at all. I'm used to chicken satay not being greasy but my napkin was filled with grease after just eating a piece (and no that was without peanut sauce). I had the spicy noodles medium which had a great spice but was also drenched in oil. There also were not a ton of veggies in it which I am used to but still good even though the next morning my husband and I paid for the amount of oil in the food.   The waitstaff leaves a lot to be desired - really nice folks but slow and they don't listen all that well. My husband asked for sweetener for his tea 4 times and still never got it. The table next to us )who was seated after us) got their food sooner and it was an epically long wait for the check. Is eat there again in a pinch but I'd try something else having the option."}
{"text":"Rudest people I've ever encountered. I asked to sit outside on the empty  patio at 645pm. The server made a face to her manager, who looked at us and shook her head in disapproval before they begrudgingly began to set the table. Oh, and we were the only people in the place on a Friday night.  I was so excited to try their food, but, in 20 years in the restaurant business I have never felt so unwelcomed. Bye."}
{"text":"Wir besuchten während unseres Aufenthalts in Phoenix mehrere Male dieses kleine thailändische Restaurant im Zentrum der Stadt. Die Speisekarte ist relativ umfangreich und enthält auch mehrere vegetarische Speisen.  Ausgezeichnet schmeckten die Suppen, die Currys und Reisgerichte. Dazu tranken wir thailändisches Bier. Die Kellnerin war sehr freundlich und nett."}
{"text":"This place is off the beaten path so without Yelp I would have never found it. I have been a couple times and ordered the Spicy Noodles with chicken both times because it was so good round 1. People need to remember Thai food is spicy in nature. I like spicy food which is a big reason why I like Thai food. You get the option of Mild, Medium, or Hot. I went Medium round 1 & Hot round 2. Hot is not for the faint of heart but I loved the spice level and the fact I needed to take a minute to cool down between bites. What bothered me was to see people send food back because it was \"too spicy\". A gentleman ordered his food \"medium\" then sent it back & left without paying because it was hotter than he wanted. If you don't like spicy food don't choose to be adventurous on somebody else's dime. I'll be back real soon."}
{"text":"I am writing this review to get attention to their night time waiter who was so hospitable to me. I asked for a dish not knowing you must go out of your way to ask for it to look like a picture on yelp. The waiter graciously took my order back to remake it like the picture without hesitation when he could have just said oh well to the situation. I am very appreciative of that gesture and will continue to frequent this location.   On a different note for the food of Thai basil in general... I never eat at chain restaurants. In fact I despise them. This is the only exception to that rule. This place's food is right on point and each location has nice waiters which I really like. Come here!!"}
{"text":"Every time I've eaten here the food is been super delicious. The Panang curry and pad Thai here are our go-to options when we're craving some good Thai food!"}
{"text":"The other reviews were right about the service. With the amount of staff they had for the customers that were there, we waited far too long for our food. We overheard two groups of people have to ask their waitress where their drink order was.   That aside the food was amazing, we had the fried sweet potato app and the had to different styles of their signature thai basil dish. It was very flavorful and the meat was juicy in both meals. I would recommend my friends to this place only if they planned on ordering out. I wouldn't go in unless I knew I had the company worth talking to while I waited to be served"}
{"text":"This is the best kept secret at the Paradise Valley Mall!  The food is good, fresh and affordable and the service is great.  It's tucked in between Macy's and Sears and can be easy to miss.  Our yoga class goes there for lunch and everyone enjoys it.  For $7.99 you can get a spring roll, soup or salad and a generous entree.  The curries are great; I especially like the green curry."}
{"text":"It seems like I have heard about Thai Basil for years but for whatever reason I had never been there. Was wondering in downtown phoenix with my girl and thought I would check Thai Basil out.   The service was okay and the food was okay. Thai basil is okay.   Pros -complementary miso soup -fast service -view of downtown phoenix street action  Cons -just average everything -small tables -odd chairs and decor"}
{"text":"I normally do not write bad reviews as I know all businesses can be effected by one's comment but I feel it is necessary as management (Rambo) poorly handled our reservations and was not even trying to be accommodating.  We called a day in advance to reserve for 24 people and even confirmed the reservation again.  Our reservation was set for 7pm on 1/20/018. We arrived early at 645pm to ensure we would be seated. However, when we arrived we were informed by Rambo very nonchalantly that he gave our seating away.  He was unapologetic and seemed to really not care as he was more concerned about the others he could seat at the smaller and fewer tables that were available.  If I could give this restaurant a ZERO star."}
{"text":"If you want to keep a good restaurant around you have to tell people to go. Go to Thai Basil in the paradise village mall. It's a great meal, a good price and location perfect for getting in and out quickly. It's turned into our go to place for Thai food, and have never been disappointed in the food. We like the lunch meal best, yellow curry with pork or chicken is addictive oh good. Go try it for something different."}
{"text":"Average downtown Thai restaurant, nice for a quick workday lunch with peers.  OK, fresh hot Thai food.  Nothing too special.  Would I go back?  Yes, but there are other better options.  Note - they had a very brisk business on a Thursday afternoon lunch, don't be surprised to wait for a table."}
{"text":"I really like their food.  The green curry is awesome.  Thai bow pork is also very good.  Their pad Thai is something we order every time and is great.  We usually order take out but always love the food."}
{"text":"The food was good. But there was almost nobody there during lunch. It's probably due to their location at PV Mall."}
{"text":"I came here on a Wednesday evening with some friends - we walked right in, only one other party was in the restaurant. The Singha beer was excellent and everyone liked their food OK- except for me. I ordered the chicken satay off the appetizer menu (basically the most americanized thing that I could get), and the chicken was undercooked. Like, super pink. We hailed the waitress, she apologized and promptly took my plate to send it back. A few minutes later, after everyone else was basically done with their entrees, I got mine back. And guess what - it was still undercooked. Not as bright pink as the last time, but definitely tinged with pink. I ate whatever white parts that I could find, not wanting to tell the waiter a 2nd time. But I should have. I found it especially weird because   the restaurant was practically empty - what are the cooks doing back there if they are not checking for the pinkness of the poultry they are serving? A little bit sketchy...."}
{"text":"Quick, tasty, inexpensive, and reliable. What more does one look for in a Thai lunch spot? You'll be rushed in and out, but that's the hallmark of a lunch joint that turns tables and fills tummies. While you're seated, you will notice that the decor is a little nicer than your typical hole-in-the-wall lunch spot, but the prices scream \"nice find!\" With lunch entrees ranging from $7.99 to $9.99, and including one spring roll and soup (salad in summer), you won't be disappointed. The quantity of food is certainly plentiful, but the service isn't particularly engaging or inspiring.  Side items are cheap, ranging from $1 to $2 for various rice sides in case the quantity the comes with your lunch entree isn't enough. Thai Basil offers the full gamut of curries, stir-fry dishes, and noodle items that you would expect. I didn't notice anything on the menu indicating what dishes were designed to be spicier than others. Y'all know that they call me Spice Fiend for a reason! On the opposite hand, if you're very averse or sensitive to spice, you may want to assert mild.   Although I insisted that my Eggplant Garlic Chicken be prepared \"Thai Hot,\" it was anything but, while one of my coworkers specified \"extra mild\" for her Pad Thai and intimated that it was barely edible due to the heat. Different strokes for different folks!  All in all, I'm glad that my local friend led us here for a quick and tasty lunch that was friendly to both wallet and to palate. It's hard to find a lunch for less than $10 that is truly satisfying and filling, while still being freshly-prepared and brought to your table!"}
{"text":"I decided to go for lunch since I saw they had pretty good lunch plate deals ($7-10 for a basic lunch plate). It was around 1pm and pretty busy, full of people that work in the surrounding area, I assume. I was quickly given a table, and then quickly rushed into ordering.   I went with Number 13, Panang Curry. It came with salad and a veggie egg roll. It's a great deal if you just want to fill your stomach, not really caring about quality or taste. Everything seemed a little watered down. For example, the sauce that comes for the egg roll seems like they added water, or a simple syrup type thing. The curry it self wasn't very tasty, just heavily spiced.   Everything was just kind of disappointing. I did like that my water glass was pretty much always full, but that was the best part."}
{"text":"I work at Paradise Valley mall and this restaurant has been my go to since I started working here! I have had both the Pad See Ew, Panang Curry, and the Thai Fried Rice but by far the thing that I order the most is the Thai Fried Rice! Everything I have had from here is excellent, the staff are friendly and have even gotten to know me over the past couple of weeks and memorized my order. I cannot say enough good things about this location. The size portions are generous and this is the perfect place to go for both lunch or dinner. Give it a try you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Worst Thai I have eaten. To heavy on fish sauce and garlic. Would not suggest it at all. Thai has the feel of freshness this lacked that"}
{"text":"Had lunch today for the third time. Can't beat the price of $7.99 which includes a salad, rice, a spring roll and the main dish. I had the BBQ pork which are actually two nice sized pieces of pork. Service and ambiance are right on. In a hard to find corner of PV mall, but it is worth checking them out."}
{"text":"We are here before going to the Orpheum. The lamb in the red curry was chewy but the beef in the yellow curry was chewier, almost inedible. The green mango salad was just OK, had too little mango. The service was hurried but courteous. Will not be coming again."}
{"text":"Very good. Came in today for coworkers birthday and ordered the garlic dish with shrimp spicy.  Food was excellent, very authentic. The food came with a tray of various chili sauces to add to the intensity of the heat. Service was quick as well which is a must for working professionals."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is a TERRIFIC spot for any occcasion. I missed breakfast this AM, got a BAD case of the hungries at 11:00 and stopped in here, hoping for the best. Mimi, my hostess, put me at ease, I orderd a Garlic Shrimp concoction that was just what the DR would recomend. LET THE DAY BEGIN..."}
{"text":"Had the Tom Yum with shrimp.  Not as bright as other versions I've had. The yellow curry chicken sauce was delicious but the chicken was overcooked."}
{"text":"The food is good.   The service still needs a little help but for the most part, its a good addition to the downtown phoenix scene and is fairly priced in comparison to the other thai restaurants downtown.  I wonder if they are going to stay open through dinner...I'm hoping that they do because downtown just doesn't have a lot of places open late!"}
{"text":"Had the Basil Chicken which was really good and flavorful. Tried the Thai Toast with spicy cucumber sauce, kinda like a crispy French toast. Waitress was very nice, place was clean with nice decor.  I'm usually the one that post negative reviews. I would be leery about some of these other negative reviews with these slanderous remarks."}
{"text":"We ordered the Drunken Noodle with crispy tofu & the veggie egg rolls & had it delivered. The food was hot & scrumptious. The egg rolls were delicious & crispy.  The portions were substantial, enough for two meals! Will definitely order again soon, yummy!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere yet the customer service sucked!  Schedule more staff when a sold out event is within walking distance of your venue. A group of 5 and 1 never received a beverage yet was charged for a glass of wine.  I paid cash (didn't trust them with my debit card) and waitress took it upon herself to keep my change.  Another of my guests waited 15 minutes longer to receive her entree; she was watching us eat.  My biggest problem was the  wine glasses...how dare you serve wine in mismatched glasses at a table for 5!!! I gave a 2 because like I stated the food is good but customer service sucked! 03/15/2017"}
{"text":"We used to enjoy this restaurant frequently.  Great lunch menu.  But sometime in the past few months the whole crew who worked there has been replaced.  We have had three disappointing meals.  Once, food cold.  Second, slow slow service and the owner (I guess) was flapping around loudly talking to workers.  When the dish came out with chicken instead of tofu and we returned it, there was quite a loud chorus of angst in the kitchen.  Today we ate there and again did not see a familiar face.  Again the wrong dish was brought out.  When you couple this with the loud music and (sometimes) TVs running it just became clear -- this isn't the restaurant for us anymore.  We'll be trying other Thai restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in search of some quality Thai food while spending the weekend in downtown Phoenix. Thai Basil was outstanding! We ordered shrimp pad thai, chicken satay skewers and panang curry. Everything was so fresh and delicious! The next time we are in Phoenix we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Thai Basil for lunch.  Ordered the Panang beef off the lunch special. First came a salad - attractive, but WOW!  the dressing was overpowering (maybe get it on the side).  The Panang was good - not a fan of green beans in Panang, but the curry was tasty.   Not a bad place to grab lunch if you're in the PV Mall area."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out for lunch and when we got there, they had accidentally given our order to someone else. They did not offer to fulfill our original order since their \"kitchen was swamped\" at the moment and told us to come back later. Not a good way to do business and we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious yellow curry and pad Thai.   Can't really complain about anything! Fair prices, good service, quality food... I guess the parking situation isn't ideal but it's downtown Phoenix, not Chicago. You'll be fine! I definitely would recommend end this place if you're looking for Thai downtown."}
{"text":"Return visit to Thai Basil. Still not as highly successful as the TB in Chandler but still good. I arrived at 11:15 on a Monday and there were 10 tables full.   The service, once again was excellent. I was greeted at the door and offered a table, brought water and a salad within 3 mins.   I tried a new dish based on Yelp reviews: Pad See Ew. The dish was good but not great. I think my issue was with the sauce: it was rather bland.  Also the noodles were so roughly chopped that the dish looked like a hot mess. It had about 3 ounces of beef, three small broccoli spears and a few carrots and onions mixed in as well.   Again, good tasting but not great. All told it came to $9.76 plus tip."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here more than a dozen times and, I must admit, we've ever only ordered one dish: the signature Thai Basil (with either tofu or chicken). It is our favorite Thai takeout in downtown Phoenix. SO flavorful and I love the spices. I should say that I like spicy food and I still order this mild. The \"medium\" level of spice varies a lot--sometimes it's a good spicy and sometimes it's a mean spicy! Yes, the service in their little mom-and-pop-esque restaurant is a little slow, but they're always super nice, and that means more to me than fast but impersonal wait staff."}
{"text":"Great place. Nice environment, quiet on a Thursday evening, nicely designed menu. Slightly on the upscale side on the interior design, but the menu is mid-priced and accessible.   My Pad Thai was fantastic - among the better I've had across the country. It's a classic dish, and they did it very well."}
{"text":"If you are expecting at least decent Thai I mean decent not even asking good authentic but this place is way below that level I feel sorry for all the ppl that is coming here ! Horrid  First and last time for us"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food. I had the red curry with duck and my wife had the spicy noodles. Both were great. Very fast service too. Definite recommend this place while downtown."}
{"text":"Trying to find a Thai restaurant in the area. Thought we would go check out Thai basil. I was disappointed from the start. I should've known when the restaurant was empty at 6 PM. First there was some grime or sauce or something on my chair and the table was not very clean. I then ordered an iced tea and the holder with the sweetener was also dirty. I was willing to overlook some of these things to try the food. However that was also disappointing. We ordered Pad Thai, Pad see Yew and sweet-and-sour chicken.  It was edible but not very good. I would not recommend this thai place. Maybe we were spoiled living in the Midwest but we have yet to find a really good Thai place here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"There was good and bad with our dining experience. First off - the food was phenomenal. I had the pad Thai and it was perfect. My husband ordered curry noodles or something which was also very delicious. So - the food i could rave on and on about.  The thing that bothered me was they had 1 waitress on staff. Granted we did come on a Sunday evening, but still. Within 15 minutes of us sitting down there was maybe 1 or 2 tables in the place that weren't occupied. This poor waitress could not keep up with how quickly people were coming in. Soon she had the host helping her take orders. Nobody had their drinks. Ours didn't get refilled. The host kid brought our sticky rice to another table. When he realized his mistake - 10 mins after putting it on the other table - he went and snatched it off that table and set it on ours. My husband asked if either one of them had been eaten on by the other people. So he opened them to check and yes - 1 of them had been partially eaten by another table. So gross and unsanitary. Basically... if they had adequate/competent wait staff they would have gotten 5 stars.  In the future - i hope they give that poor girl more help on Sunday nights. It would save her the stress and unhappy customers irritated with the business as a whole."}
{"text":"Dinner: good priced cocktails but on small side. Noodles on pad tai over cook. Coconut soup excellent. Seafood grill ok . Quiet. No crowd so we liked the place except for the noodles. They stuck together too much.  Good thing is we could share the food without a plate charge."}
{"text":"We waited for over 30min for a Togo order which seemed excessive but the food was delicious. The food was a solid four stars but the service was a two at best, hence a 3 star overall. Our server was pleasant and did everything she could to check in on us but the guy behind the bar top, expo side, was horrible. He was speaking down to our server and dropped our food off to us without saying anything or acknowledging us. We felt bad for the server and don't recommend eating in as the staff is very lean. 7+ tables in the dining area and 5-6 Togo orders happening besides us with only five people working including the cooks. Food was solid but experience is poor, stick to calling in your order for pick up."}
{"text":"Went there tonight with four friends, it was my first time experiencing Thai Food. Food was okay, the service was AWFUL. There was only four tables in the whole place so I don't understand why service and the kitchen was so slow.  We ordered two appetizers, one came in decent timing but the second one didn't come until 20 mins later. We ordered our entrees the same time we ordered our appetizers and it took sooo LONG to get them. We didn't even get our entrees at the same time... I got mine first which was the green curry. I waited for my parties food to come... 15-20 mins later the second entree came out. Then another 10 mins the 3rd entree came out and then the last one came out like 8-10 mins after that. I also noticed that other tables were also receiving their plates incomplete at various times.  I don't think they know how to run their tickets through the kitchen.  All three ordered pad thai so I do not understand why they all didn't come out at once. I think its extremely rude to send out incomplete orders to tables and make patrons wait that long. The whole point of going out to eat is to enjoy the experience and food all together. No one is gonna start eating when the rest of their party doesn't have their food.  Two of my friends made their pad thai a spiciness of 4 and it was not spicy at all. My curry was more spicy and I asked for a 2.  One of the servers who was helping us was rude to us when she announced the plate she did said it fast and we asked her what it was again and she was so snippy when she repeated it. She got us boxes when we asked for them but she was mad we didn't clear the table to allow her to place them in the center of the table.   Never coming back here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had lunch there and got two noodle dishes. The service was friendly and the food was delicious and out in a timely manner. The restaurant itself was very clean and inviting. I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice for lunch so far and really enjoyed it.  I found the food very fresh and tasty.  As a vegetarian I had a lot of dishes to choose from.  The lunch special was a great deal as well.  I will definitely be back and highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Today at lunch we asked for the crab puffs which were no longer on the menu - Of course they can make them for us, with a smile. Fresh food, delicious and a place that takes care of its customers..Don't miss."}
{"text":"Soooo disappointing.  I've been going here for 2 years and loved their shrimp Pad Thai. Always great and lots of good shrimp. Tonight the shrimp was horrible like old and rubbery and the seasoning was not the same. Sent back the dish and it came out the same. Told the chef was new and then that the chef wasn't new. Left without eating."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! If you're near PV Mall and like Thai, this is the place to go! The entire staff is fantastic, and the food is authentic and delicious. If I could give them 6 stars, I would. My wife and I are here once a week....at least.   They will make it as hot as you like it. But, be warned, Thai hot is, well, H O T!"}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients fantastic authenticity. Even better service. Best thai I've had thus far."}
{"text":"Amazing pad Thai!  Portion sizes are great and the flavor is outstanding. Savory citrus and then a little spice. They do a very good job and have take out!  Great service as well."}
{"text":"Awesome service. Quick delivery of food. We had the following 5 star items: Thai tea, Thai coffee and the garlic eggplant with tofu. The Signature That Basil with tofu was not quite as good. It was a little flat, without complex flavors -would give it a 3.5. I would order something else next time."}
{"text":"Great for lunch! The green curry is the best of the curries they offer at this location and they aren't afraid to make it at least a little spicy when you order Thai hot. Certainly it is the best value for lunch downtown and a really nice but busy atmosphere."}
{"text":"For the quick visit that I came for (one beer), the experience was quaint. Definitely have to revisit this place for food."}
{"text":"Just ok...this is the new Thai place that opened in my building in Phoenix.  I was so excited for it to open because of the convenience and the fact that I love Thai food...but, I was disappointed.  The panang curry was not good - just peanut paste - not what other Thai restaurants serve!  The service was not great either.  They brought all of the dishes at different times.  They also had the music up way too loud - it was hard to have a conversation."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place during my weekend trip in Phoenix, shortly before heading back home in the Bay Area. I tried the spicy pork fried rice. I'm all about pork and spicy so this meal was as delicious as I expected. Overall, the food and service was all around excellent."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered takeout tonight, and the food was absolutely delicious!  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Made plans to go someplace different for Mother's Day. Got to Thai Basil Signature at 11:10 a.m. They were not open - hours were posted as opening at 11:00 on Sunday. I made eye contact with someone inside, and he motioned to give him a minute. It was 11:20 when we left the mall and they still were not open... Very disappointed. This would have been our first visit. We won't try it again."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years and always had great food. However, the last two experiences have made us decide not to return. Each of our last meals have been take out. And each of these meals (3 main courses) were not prepared even remotely close to the order. I always order my meals 4 hot on their 1-5 hot scale. I LOVE heat! Then, I always ask for the red chili paste on the side and punch it up even more. However, the meal was so hot that I could not take more tan two bites. What makes it even worse, is that they prepared my husband's and daughter's equally hot. Just not going to waste our money here any more."}
{"text":"Amazing place for lunch. Highly recommended. Their signature dish, Thai basil, is amazing! Even though it might seem busy at lunch, the kitchen is super quick and the food comes fast and tables turn quickly. I would not worry if it looks busy, service will be speedy. Recommended highly when needing quick lunch downtown."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Thai basil! I'm shocked it doesn't get busier like the location in Phoenix. The lunch special is such a great deal and love the portion size."}
{"text":"Attitude sucks  Food don't matter  Restaurant hours says closes at 9.30 And 8.30 they were closed once"}
{"text":"Peanut curry with chicken and brown rice ordered medium spicy was the best I've had in this state by a long shot!! Quality food and not oily like other Thai places in the valley. My husband had the pad Thai with chicken and that was incredible too! We ordered off UberEATS and it arrived piping hot:) highly recommend this place! Prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Good place to go for lunch. Only it is always extremely full and there is very limited seating. Staff always seem disoriented and confused but the food makes up for it. I recommend all of their chicken dishes! Always cooked to perfection."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I ordered the red curry and thai iced tea. The curry had plenty veggies and chicken, that it made my tummy satisfied. The lunch special includes a spring roll and soup! The service was great. The waiter let me sit wherever I wanted. I have absolutely no complaints I love this place!"}
{"text":"So delicious, clean and authentic! Highly recommended!  They even had real young white coconuts, my favorite :)"}
{"text":"Wonderful food. It's where I go if I want curry. Plus the environment is beautiful - large windows, quiet atmosphere, etc."}
{"text":"Service was good. Reduced price lunch specials. Pad Thai was ok. Maybe the curries are better."}
{"text":"This place messed up my take out order a few times now. They also \" forgot\" that I ordered Thai tea for a couple times, I had to remind them... Bad service!!!"}
{"text":"I tried their signature dish called the Thai Basil. It wasn't awful but for me it was too out of balance in flavors. It did have a very nice spicy heat level and I liked that you could pick many proteins you don't normally see offered at Thai Restaurants. For me it really needed more basil flavor mostly because the three leaves they used didn't give it that full basil flavor. I thought it needed some garlic too. The other for me out of balance issues was that this dish was very sweet and oddly the broccoli seemed almost candied as it was even much sweeter than the sauce. I wonder if the broccoli was pulled out of another dish since it tasted so different? The other dominate flavor was soy sauce and that doesn't seem right to me. I know this dish is traditionally chicken but I picked salmon as a choice and salmon worked well as it picked up flavor easily but it wasn't the quality I like.  My husband tried the Thai Spicy Sausage. It came with rice, raw ginger, raw cabbage and peanuts. My husband said the sausage was good but this plate seemed disappointing and too plain. I don't think anybody eats raw ginger so it was odd that it was on the plate. It just was a really odd plate.  Next door is a really great gelato shop!"}
{"text":"You guys. File this one under \"you had one job.\"  I've ordered take out from here a couple times and the food is decent, mostly I chose this location because I'm a vegetarian/pescatarian and they offer Tom kha without meat.  So tonight I'm feeling under the weather and my sweet hubby offered to go get me tofu tom kha, along with pad Thai for himself.  He returned with a huge bag of food and just as he walked in the restaurant called. Apparently he had the wrong order. He said he asked the restaurant ten times if it was right because the total seemed high, but they assured him it was right and he didn't really know what I ordered. Sure enough we got the wrong order and were charged $50. So my being ill and dying for soup, my husband drove all the way back to pick up our correct order.   He walks in the door and I'm starving. Ready to eat my soup and go to bed.  So I dump my soup into a bowl and what do I see? Giant pieces of fatty gross chicken. Well you can imagine my husband is furious at this point but he maintains his composure and calls the restaurant receiving barely an apology. He drives now for the THIRD TIME to pick up a simple order of two items.  If you decide to order from this place double and triple check your order, or better yet stay away entirely!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on happenstance for a late meal. Masamun curry had excellent flavor, although light on the meat and relatively heavy on the potatoes. Service was very attentive, and I thought the simple and modern decor worked really well. Big fan of the full length windows on this place. Gives the restaurant a great feel after dark."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, upon picking up I was charged twice, they did not void the first accidental charge and the altered my receipt, adding a fat tip that I did not authorize. So disappointed, beware."}
{"text":"Tonight there was only one server and the lace was packed. She did a great job and managed to get my order out really quickly. Oh, and she was also responsible for carryout orders. I have no idea how she did it...  Food was great."}
{"text":"Only Thai place open on a Sunday in downtown Phoenix.  That being said, it was my only choice so I made the best of it.  My summer roll was not good, so bad in fact, I sent it back.  I don't usually do that either but in this case, the lettuce was brown and there were literally two pieces of tofu in the entire roll.  The Panang curry, my dish of choice, was average but my Thai pudding with sticky rice was great.  Wouldn't give this place a second chance but the staff was friendly to say the least."}
{"text":"Despite it's location (attached to the mall), I'm going to highly recommend this it you like Thai. The other 3 reviews did not lead me wrong with the recommendation for the Pad Thai.  It wasn't until I had devoured half the meal that I thought about taking a picture. The presentation was very neat and I really enjoyed the flavor of the crushed peanuts.   I ordered it with a medium spice. At first bite I was worries I'd made a mistake, but as the temperature cooled, so did the spice.   Do yourself a favor & check this place out :)"}
{"text":"I think the reviews on yelp are for two different places. This is for the location on Hayden and pinnacle peak. We ordered 7 dishes and the food just kept getting better. Amazing pho won ton soup, curry noodles, drunken noodles, chicken satay and the pot stickers.  This place is really really good. I have no idea how others have rated this low. It really deserves 5 stars."}
{"text":"Full of flavor, easy on the wallet, light on the stomach, efficient service, and a new member of my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre and although they say they are open until 9, the doors were locked at 8:35 pm. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is very salty. I couldn't the eat even half of my food. The service is average. The price is way more than a regular Thai restaurant that I have been to. Maybe because its in the mall area i guess. It is totally not worth of the money. Little disappointed."}
{"text":"Not the best Thai, not the worst.   We had the yellow curry chicken and the beef pad Thai. Both were ok. Nothing to rave about by any means. The chicken lettuce wraps were bland.   Service was super slow. It was only my party (of 2) and another table of 4 in the entire place. Food took a good 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Lots of inconsistent reviews here so I wanted to write and share our good take out experience. We ordered the green papaya salad (my test for every Thai restaurant - if they can make it well, it's a good sign), garlic eggplant, spicy noodles and red curry. It was our first time there so while we enjoy spicy, we got everything \"medium\" just to gauge what that was like. The food was ready when they said it would be. The papaya salad wax quite spicy, crunchy and citrusy. Thumbs up. The other dishes were not medium spicy to my palate, so they may run a bit mild there and we will get things a bit spicier next time. The portions seemed a bit small for the price - what we ordered seemed like a lot of food, but we don't have that much in terms of leftovers!  Maybe we were just really hungry. Overall, everything was quite good, we will order from them again."}
{"text":"Leaving four stars because the food is very tasty. My husband and I love thai food, and are very excited to have one so near us. The chicken satay is flavorful and cooked well, pad thai (my personal favorite) leaves none to be desired, great curries, tasty overall. The only issue we have experienced is perhaps the service could be managed in a better way. We ordered beers which were forgotten about until 20 minutes into the meal when we finally reminded them. Our water glasses were never refilled (my husband actually got up and got the water pitcher himself off the counter as we had been waiting for so long,) and the server seemed to be more interested in his cell phone than his customers. Had the restaraunt been busy, I would not have minded so much the slower service, however we were one of only 2 tables dining that afternoon. So, yes. I would go back. The food is great. Just maybe the owners need to speak with their servers about actual service :)"}
{"text":"This place is very good. You will not be disappointed. The coconut pineapple ice cream with fried banana is so delicious. Service was friendly, quick and attentive."}
{"text":"Ate here twice while on vacation and loved it.  I should mention that I have never really liked Thai food, but this place was great.  With each dish, they ask what level of spice you prefer and what type of meat.  If you're sensitive to spicy foods, just choose no spice and you'll still get a flavorful dish.  We tried the Pad-See-Ew (with no spice), Red Curry (w/ medium spice), Curry Noodles (w/ mild spice), and Drunken Noodles (w/ medium spice) all with chicken.  Highly recommend the curry dishes.  They're soupy, warm, flavorful, and just all-around delicious. We will definitely return to Thai Basil on our next visit to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Refreshingly delicious food & service each time. I'm hooked!  I've tried many Thai restaurants in the area but found few with this level of consistent quality.  Try the Thai basil signature dish and mango sticky rice ( purple rice ).  Wow!"}
{"text":"Over priced. Horrible service. The serves barley helped us and had to ask for water multiple times. Servers weren't nice and we felt like we were rushed. Food is decent. But the overall experience wasn't great. Stay Away!"}
{"text":"Fresh food, and very casual ambience! Good service and quality options:) this is the only Thai restaurant by my home, but they do it well, and I appreciate having the variety of Asian dishes, not just Thai. It's not too big of a place so if you sit a table away from a group, you'll hear their whole conversation, and they'll snoop on yours too:)"}
{"text":"I love Thai food so when I was up in the North side of the valley I figured I would give this place a try. I ordered the yellow curry, it was good but not as good as I expected it to be based on the reviews I read.  I won't be making a special trip to go there again but if I am in the area I will consider it and maybe try something else off the menu."}
{"text":"Definitely disappointed in their takeout tonight. My husband ordered the seafood entree. $17 gets you literally the smallest portion of seafood I think we've ever seen. The pad Thai is 99% noodles. Very few vegetables or tofu. Not to mention half of it was leaking everywhere before I even got home because they packaged it in a paper box. Seems like this place just cuts corners to try and make a buck. Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"I just noticed this place a few weeks back and had to go there to show my support ; ) We ended up there for a weekday dinner and the food and the service were great. Our server Raul was very nice and friendly. He made some recommendations and clarifications to help us decide. We had spring rolls (veggie, flour fried ones), very tasty and crispy. I had the coconut soup and hubby had the spicy noodles. That soup I love and it was up to my expectations. Hubby did like the noodles too. We even made a big exception and had dessert : ) the fried banana something. Hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was about 5 to 6 minutes walk from the court complex in downtown Phoenix. I went here on a lunch break from my interview for jury duty.   While it is small, its corner location affords it a good view of the nearby street intersection. The service is polite, professional & efficient.   A very small side salad with Thai vinaigrette dressing was put on my table, as soon as I sat down, along with the menu. The lunch menu is a single laminated sheet, listing popular dishes & drinks. Once ordered, the lunch dish was brought out quickly.   The Pad Thai with pork I had was pretty typical. Its portion size was just right.   If I am in the vicinity again, I will consider stopping in & trying other dishes."}
{"text":"Located on the outer edge of the Paradise Mall, this little Thai restaurant was a very pleasant surprise.  With tables both inside and outside, the atmosphere is nothing special.  When we had to wait to be waited on, we worried that we'd made a mistake ...  But the thing that really counts, the food, was good.  The Thai basil with chicken (pad ga pao) was outstanding, flavorful with a variety of vegetables, and quite spicy at medium spicy - it was really good.  The fried rice (khow pad) was typical Thai style and well done.   The BBQ chicken (grilled chicken breast) was the only dish that wasn't great, but that's not why you'd go to a Thai restaurant anyway (sort of like having chicken on the menu at a steak place - not for your intended audience).  Simply put, this is the best Thai food I've had in Scottsdale after several disappointing experiences elsewhere."}
{"text":"Sadly, the last three times I've been here, the curry has been extraordinarily watery and tasteless. I feel like maybe they are phoning it in due to their great lunch-time location..."}
{"text":"Cockroaches IN THE FOOD.  We wouldn't have believed it if we hadn't seen it.  Be fair warned and DO NOT EAT HERE.  We ordered takeout for 5 adults.  Once the food was picked up and taken home, we opened it all up so everyone could eat buffet style.  Just as we were about to start serving, my husband suddenly saw a LIVE COCKROACH come out from underneath the Coconut Shrimp appetizer.  We wrapped everything back up, sealed the bag with the cockroach and called them back.  We demanded a refund and a driver came to our home and picked up all the food.  We called the health department today and are still waiting to see if we got our refund from the restaurant.  We have pictures if we need them.  I'm still getting the shivers.  There are apparently at least 4 other references here on Yelp to cockroaches with this establishment which I never saw previously - that alone makes me sick.  Imagine the people who haven't reported it.  Thank GOD we saw the bug before we started eating.  In case anyone isn't aware, cockroaches carry disease.  I'm STILL getting the shivers!  This is singlehandedly the most disgusting thing ever experienced."}
{"text":"I like this place as the food is good and at decent prices. They offer a full menu of all the Thai favorites plus a full bar service. I wished I like it a little more but the service can be spotty. It's all depends on the crowd size. When there are a few diners it all works great. But if things get busy, the staff is so lean, things suffer. The food is a 4 but the service is a 2, so 3 stars."}
{"text":"The BBQ Chicken here is my son favorite. I always come here just buy the chicken BBQ, and the Spicy green beans is my Favorite. The dish is extremely prepared"}
{"text":"I only had 2 appetizers because I was looking for something light, but the shrimp rice rolls came out with brown cabbage and the chicken satay was horrible. The peanut sauce literally tasted like a clump of low quality oily peanut butter. The Thai restaurant just a block away (sorry name of the place escapes me) but it is WAY better. It is right across the street from the Renaissance and I ate there for lunch recently and it was much much better. This place, Thai Basil is probably some of the worst Thai food I've ever had. Blech!!"}
{"text":"First time at the restaurant.  Service was extremely slow.  Watched other people that came in after us get served before us.  Food is average at best, service left me feeling very frustrated.  Without comment from us, they apologized in the most insincere manner.  My Wife suggested I leave a note and here it is.  As they say, you only get one time to make a first impression and my experience was very poor.  I have no intention on returning to this establishment."}
{"text":"Super Service, but mediocre food. Pad Thai was OK. I never leave a Thai restaurant without ordering my favorite,  sweet sticky rice with mango. The sweet sticky rice with mango small portion was disappointing. I wish the portion was a tad more, as it felt as if I got two bites of the sweet sticky rice. I guess if you want a small portion it was ok, but it left me wanting more. Overall this restaurant was OK.  If you are looking for a quick bite with ambiance and great service try it for yourself, but  If you have a big appetite I would skip this place."}
{"text":"We had worked up an appetite after successfully escaping the room downtown.   A friend and I decided to split the pad thai and some curry. Both were decent. I left wish the curry had a more robust flavor and was a little thicker, but everything was cooked perfect.  The pad thai was more of the same. Perfectly good but wishing that it was a little better.  The service was good, which I expected since the place wasn't exactly packed."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place! Have tried 3 different thai places and this one is by far the best! The food is amazing. I would recommend this establishment to anyone. PAD THAI with shrimp is my favorite. My son and I will be back!"}
{"text":"I recently ordered with Doordash. The packaging was horrible. The doordasher person even commented on it. The pad thai box was open, the rice dish was open. The rice was al dente--but that may be good for delivery in case it cooks more (but by being thrown in, and open, it didn't cook more). There was no taste to anything but the green curry dish. Kudos for the green curry but the signature dish had veggies that tasted and appeared to be from frozen and may have been freezer burnt. It was to be the basil signature but I don't count three small basil leaves as being described as basil with [...].  Pad thai didn't taste good at all. It looked like there were scrambled eggs from day before just dropped in after cooking.  For $14 a plate, I would expect more.  The spring rolls had no taste and we didn't taste anything besides fried cabbage. Although, I haven't yet found any spring rolls Phoenix that actually have the Thai herbs and recognizable veggies. Also, what is the deal with all the watered down sauces?! As you can tell, I was very disappointed with the Sunday dinner."}
{"text":"I've come here multiple times for take out when I'm too lazy to cook myself. You can call ahead to order - they are always pretty quick and the food is normally ready within 15mins.   I usually get green curry chicken/red curry chicken/ pineapple fried rice/ pad Thai, etc. The taste is decent but nothing really stands out. I would have got the same food with the same taste at a takeout Thai restaurant in New York City. But it can't compare to any super authentic Thai restaurants where the ingredients are of high quality and more refresh.   This place is good value, clean, and convenient. I will come here again in the future. Meets my expectation of an above average Thai takeout place."}
{"text":"This is a nice Thai corner inside the Paradise Mall. We went there during lunch time and loved our experience. Their lunch special is a must try and you can have a nice meal for under $10. The lunch meal comes with soup or salad and a veggie spring roll.  The lunch combos include all curry types, fried rice and other varieties. The staff is very welcoming and super friendly. Even if you show up solo, there are multiple TV screens to keep you entertained. I recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a fulfilling meal and experience the Thai hospitality! The ambiance is very inviting as well."}
{"text":"Visited this place during our visit to downtown Phoenix. Nice interiors and very friendly staff. The decoration on the interior was stunning in a traditional Thai setting. It was one of the few places that were opened on a Saturday evening.  We were seated immediately and we ordered Moscow Mule drink and tempura. We just showed up for a quick drink and leave. The Moscow mule tastes great and was served in a traditional cup. The tempura was good but it took forever to be served. We went at a time when there was not too much crowd, hence we were really not sure why it would take that much time. But overall good food served here.  We definitely recommend this to other!  Food: 5/5 Service: 3.5/5 Value: 4/5"}
{"text":"Food was fair and restaurant had lost my order so had to wait and remade it. Seemed Very unorganized."}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch right before 3pm. I was immediately brought water and soup. Soon thereafter I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai. They did not disappoint. Food was tasty, hot, and what I expected! I love when a restaurant meets my expectations! I'll be back to check out there dinner menu"}
{"text":"This is what I'd classify as a \"great little neighborhood restaurant.\"  Good value, good food, good service and nice enough that you can bring guests and friends here for a meal together but not the kind of place you make the haul across Phoenix to go eat at.  They do a great job with a variety of different Asian cuisines so you aren't limited to Thai.  I HIGHLY recommend the Thai Iced Tea!  If you live local, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"I had their pad Thai with chicken. Usually the pad thais I've had, had that peanut sauce which was a bit sweet. I don't know what kind of sauce they use for this one but it's tangy, sweet, and sour. They drenched the pad Thai with sauce which normally I don't mind because I love sauce but this was a little too much. It was good, though.  The service is great. The people were attentive and really nice. They came to fill up my water frequently and came occasionally to check up.   They didn't have happy hour. I would recommend it. The portions are big enough for two people. And the pad Thai was around $10"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai place in town!!! You will not be disappointed this place is hot and popular! I can't even explain how delicious their food is you must try for yourself. Very authentic food and presentation was beautiful! Amazing service and such nice people that work here!"}
{"text":"Well I shouldn't have expected much. Random Thai downtown.   Ordered the fresh rolls. Wow. Embarrassing. Only lettuce and carrot. One shrimp split between 4 rolls.   Don't worry. It gets more Meh from there.  Green curry is almost made from a rue. Has more a consistency of being made with corn starch than coconut milk.   The worst was it not being spicy (at #5 hot) and broccoli in it!!!  Eeeewwww.   Oh no fork or napkin or chop sticks. Had to get my own after app and main both came (from another table)  No need to stop here unless it's the only place open on a Sunday like it was for me."}
{"text":"Great Thai Food is not easy to find in the Phoenix area and this restaurant is yet another average Thai eatery to add to the list.  My oldest daughter and I stopped in here after not being able to get a table in Cibo (a downtown pizzeria) due to the crowds downtown for First Friday.  The restaurant decor is nothing to dial home about and is EXTREMELY small and tight. This is not the place to go t if you want a quiet meal and or hear the conversation of those at your table.  Our dinner was interrupted by a loud group of 15 that was seated directly next to us about halfway through our meal and who kept bumping into our table...so much so that we hurriedly finished our meal to get out of the place.  The food itself was very bland and the food lacked flavor and attention to detail. The lack of detail even shows up in their business cards...someone misspelled Phoenix ( spelled as Pheonix)  on the cards they give out to customers when you leave the restaurant to drum up business for the Ahwatukee and Scottsdale locations...."}
{"text":"I came in at 12:30, seated immediately. Ordered Lunch Green curry. It served within 10 min. It is very flavorful and good! Fast service + great food!! I'm a fan!!!"}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful Thai cuisine is served at this establishment. My husband loves the Thai fried rice and I go back and forth between the Pad Thai and Drunken noodles. Service is always friendly and the food is always served nice and hot if it is a hot dish. Go for the medium spice and then ask for the out spice tray so that you can add more spice and flavor if you need it."}
{"text":"I've tried Massaman Curry at dozens of Thai restaurants across several states and am absolutely blown away by Thai Basil Signature. I'm a picky eater and couldn't find one thing I'd change about it. Tender meat, perfectly cooked veggies, swimming in the most delicious sauce anyone has ever dreamed of!   I devoured my to-go lunch and seriously considered going back for a second order. This will be my new weekly ritual as their entire menu is reasonably priced and the food tastes phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's my go to lunch spot when I'm at work in N. Scottsdale. Raul and the other staff always give such great service and greet me with a smile! I phone my order in and by the time I get there (approximately 10 minutes) it's already ready for me. I've only ordered the chicken pad Thai...and it is delicious! I ordered mild the first time and it had no spice, so from now on I order medium and feel it is the perfect spice level! I wish their Thai iced teas came in larger cups...it is so refreshing! I could drink 3 of those in one sitting! Highly recommend this as a great place to go for take out!"}
{"text":"The curry at Thai Basil was outstanding. It's a wonderful place to go for lunch in downtown Phoenix. It gets busy in there so it's best to get there early and beat the crowd."}
{"text":"Almost sure I tasted ketchup In the Pad Thai that was not spicy at a number 3. If not, it really lacked on that magical Thai balance of flavor with little to no fish sauce used. Mediocre would be a stretch for this joint that uses Romain or green leaf lettuce in its \"Fresh Roll\".  No herbs.  Cutting corners is easy I suppose when there is no real competition within a few miles.  I could go on about the poor knife cuts and onions larger than 1.5\" chunks that eat almost raw at that size and so on, but I've vented enough."}
{"text":"I stopped in her after doing the downtown wine walk. Everyone was extremely friendly and I couldn't have been more appreciative. I ordered the drunken noodles to go and maybe that was my mistake. When I got home, my noodles were all clumped together which is not how I remember drunken noodles being. They meal itself seemed to lack a little flavor and was just kinda bland. I ordered mine with chicken and I swear I had a veggie drunken noodle with a touch (like one to two pieces of chicken) in the entire dish.  I wasn't exactly thrilled so I touched up the dish myself with a few more seasons and I added some leftover chicken I had to salvage the meal. I will give 5 stars for service and 1 star for the meal itself. Maybe it was an off day?"}
{"text":"Chef is the driving force behind this restaurant. He churns our each and every dish and is dedicated to ensure constancy and speed.   The front end staff need some improvements where their grasp of service is concerned, but they are all friendly and kind.   They want to please you and I've done take out here at least 20 times and it's always good."}
{"text":"Delicious!!  That food was amazing!  I have never been here before, but have wanted to stop in every time I walked by it.  If you are thinking the same thing, you NEED to stop!  I got the Signature Dish with pork and medium spice, TO DIE FOR!  I will definitely be coming back here again.  Thank you guys for an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"The Thai basil signature dish is pretty good. I ordered spicy level 4 but it was still not hot enough for me.  They would charge an extra three dollars if you try to have a combo of meat."}
{"text":"Americanized Thai food with subpar service.  My buddy likes coming here, but he likes anything that strikes him as a good deal.  That's code for the prices aren't that bad."}
{"text":"A friend and I came in on a whim during the lunch hour and got seated quickly, and served quickly. The staff was nice. My metric for how good a the place is, is how good their pad thai is. This place has decent pad thai. The chili flavor came out really well, but needed more peanut/peanut sauce. The dish came with broth which was pretty boring, and a spring roll which was fried perfectly but not particularly tasty. For what I paid, I wasn't super impressed, but willing to try again and go for a curry dish next time see where it lands."}
{"text":"Terrible. Bland over cooked rice. Curry soup with bland spaghetti noodles in it and uncooked red onions! Burnt potstickers! Awful! Will not return. Even asked for no peanuts and not them anyways. Horribly done. The kids didn't even like it."}
{"text":"We've been regulars at Thai basil for years but recently there must have been a change in chefs because we ordered our usual and the shrimp was rubbery and the cashew sautée had absolutely no flavor even tho I ordered it hot. We reordered thinking they made a mistake and the shrimp came rubbery again and with no flavor. We walked out. We're removing this restaurant from our regular Friday night rotation. It was horrible!!!"}
{"text":"Food was great, service was slow. We ordered 5 dishes and they each came out at different times. I asked for Thai hot spice level and it was medium at best. I would definitely give them another chance because the food was delicious. Hopefully service will be better next time around."}
{"text":"Went to dinner here a few nights ago with a friend. I had the spicy green beans with pork, which was suggested by the waitress, and it was amazing. Fresh green beans, just the right amount of spice (I got a 3,  but probably will get a 4 next time). The service was great, never had to ask for a refill on water and the jasmine tea paired perfectly with the food. My friend had the green curry, which he liked as well.  I'm actually heading their for lunch today since I'm downtown for jury duty. Great place to eat downtown."}
{"text":"I ended up at Thai Basil by accident. I headed South on Central and was looking for the Thai place on Adams and Central (apparently there are more than one there too) anyway I forgot at that point you are on 1st. Well I was parked and the place looked nice so I ate here. I was seated and given the lunch menu. They promptly brought out a glass of water, silverware and a cup of broth soup. The menu was pretty typical Thai Lunch Specials for here. I noticed the BBQ Pork and that sounded good so I decided to give that a try. The soup was mostly broth but it was tasty and just the right temperature. I was surprised when they brought out the order what looked like two thin sliced pork chops on a bed of greens (Cabbage...) a pile of white rice a Spring roll and two cups of sauce. I tried the spring roll first because I am a huge fan of them. I was instantly disappointed. It was not only room temperature but it lacked much of any filling inside. The dipping sauce was ok but it would have been nice if they had some hot mustard on the table to add a bit to it. Next I cut up some of the pork and dipped it in the BBQ sauce. All was forgiven. This was very good, cooked properly and very tasty. The service was very good and the price was certainly fair. It is not one of the best Thai places in Phoenix, but it is very good and I will be back again."}
{"text":"I go get Tum yum all over. Basically got no chicken in my soup. 5/10. I live across the street and I wont be going back. Simply overpriced for taste."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. The food is mediocre. Not bad. But there's other places out there better."}
{"text":"They have THE BEST Coconut soup (tom-kah) that I've tasted in Arizona. Other restaurants I've tried their coconut soup was typically bland, but at Thai Bail this soup would perfectly describe what thai food is. Every spoonful is bursting with bold delicious flavors such as lemon grass, cilantro, coconut milk, and other Thai spices.  I normally order mild or with a little spice which why others has told me my soup is bland but at Thai Basil that isn't an excuse, it was very delicious and did not disappoint."}
{"text":"I was in the PV area with friends and they wanted to try it out. I ordered some wings and spring rolls as appetizers. We also ordered happy hour beers and the service was quick with both food and beverage. I'll admit i thought they might do some magic Thai wings but they were just regular, tasty (but kinda small) wings with a sweet Thai sauce. I hosed myself by getting my hopes up. The spring rolls were good.   I got the red curry and it was all that i thought it would be. One of the other diners got a garlic and chicken dish that looked great but didn't have a ton of flavor beyond garlic. The people at my table had never tried curry and after they tasted it said they would go back and try more curry dishes.  Parking is in the mall lot out front. At the time I ate there they had a 10% Yelp coupon on your phone. I always love a good deal so with that and HH beers it was sub $ 50 for the three of us. I like the decor once you get inside but I was worried since it is in mall."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai spot in the valley for sure. They do have four locations also just in case you aren't in downtown. All the curries are great but the curry noodles are the best. Order those for sure!"}
{"text":"Just to clarify the other posts. The guy that ran Thai Pan (Thai Basil predecessor) pretty much catered to the typical scared American that wouldn't want to order from a Thai only menu.  For example, on top of his Thai selections he had dishes like \"Tai-Yaki\" which was just chicken teriyaki dressed up and an \"Atkins\" section.   Under new ownership those things are gone.  The staff, like the menu, appears to be all Thai. They all certainly speak Thai and a lot of the basic Thai accessories are there. Because of the name change, I ate there for the first time and the food was actually pretty good, service was decent and the staff was extremely pleasant.   I'll definitely be going back to try some more dishes but won't be ordering sushi."}
{"text":"Bait and switch raw deal... Walked in at 2:55 and saw that lunch was ending at 3 pm. We specifically asked if we could still get lunch. The gentleman behind the counter pointed to the lunch menus and we started browsing and asking questions.   Just as we were about to place our order a woman came from the back and told us that now lunch was over. We would have to now order from the more expensive dinner menu.    We asked if we could still order lunch as we were offered that when we came in and she insisted no.   I was stunned. Shocked. We really were in the mood for Thai but chose to leave instead of getting bullied into buying the same food at a higher price.   Too bad. Bad service = loss of business. They seem to forget that we vote with our $$$. I've eaten here before and they have good Thai food. Not sure why we got the raw deal today.   Great hidden location at the corner of Hayden and Pinnacle Peak. Ample parking and the best gelato shop in the Valley is right next door. Save room for it!  It's worth every extra calorie loaded bite."}
{"text":"The dining area is clean and classy with gold and warm tones accentuated with black. A few thai Buddha's, picture of the thai royalty, but all in good measure. They also have a couple of tv screens, so we were able to see the World Cup while we ate.   Service, was good, kind and straight to the point. Then again we were the only ones there.   Food, was delicous! I had the papaya salad. First time trying it out. Asked for it medium heat. It had all the staples of thai cusine sour, sweet, salty, bitter and spicy. It had great bite in both heat and texture. The papaya was shredded like noodles. Zesty lime, jalapeno, thai chile. Wow!  The pad thai too, medium heat. Just remember that when you order it, it only comes with tofu. If you want an additional protein like: chicken, shrimp, etc. You need to ask for it. It comes with a lime wedge, spring onions and peanuts on the side. It had great sauce coverage. It had the great flavors of sour, sweet, and spicy. Delicious!  Price was great. Between me and my husband. The two plates mentioned above with thai tea about $30ish with taxes not including tip. Not bad.  We will surely be back."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for a nearby Thai restaurant that delivers. Sadly although the food was edible and had hints if Thai flavor it was so Americanized it lacked the garlicky fish sauce aroma and heat of real Thai food. Not really worth the fairly steep price. If you're looking for authentic Thai food skip it. Sad because the menu is quite nice in variety and pictures look tasty."}
{"text":"This is my go to Thai restaurant in Scottsdale. I always order their red curry chicken. I do wish the the curry sauce was a little thicker and less watery but best Thai in Scottsdale I've tried so far."}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp and absolutely love it. We love the \"Drunken\" Noodles and Coconut Soup. They are a couple of our favorite dishes and have always been pretty consistent in taste. Dine in or take out! The staff is extremely attentive and very nice. We have recommended this restaurant to our friends and will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, pleasant atmosphere, great service.  A lovely experience all around!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went here early evening with another couple. We were the only table at that time. We had one appetizer, fresh roll with tofu. It wasn't served with the normal peanut sauce but it was tasty and fresh. We ordered 3 different curry and spicy noodles. Each dish was spot on. The Thai Ice Tea was delicious. Our server Summer was very nice and attentive. The restaurant started to fill up when we were finishing our meal.  We are looking forward to our next visit. I wanted to try the Sticky Rice for dessert but with That's Amore gelato next door maybe next time."}
{"text":"So nice for the restaurant to offer online ordering, but what is the point if they are going to ignore our requests?  We ordered online and picked up 1/2 hour later, so they had plenty of time to fix our order right. Basically we requested a couple of our dishes at medium spicy, and what we got was mild and the hot sauce was on the side...trust me, that never makes the dish taste the same.  We asked for a noodle soup to be completely mild, and it was way spicy.  I called after we received our order, the lady who answered the phone told me the soup base is already spicy, but ok, I requested mild in the order, and when you can't make it the way we want it, wouldn't you at least notify me?  So we got this spicy hot noodle soup that we didn't want.  Lastly, the purple sticky rice with custard was another disappointment.  The sticky rice was not sticky at all, almost like uncooked rice. Overall, a disappointing meal.  This was the 3rd time we ordered from the restaurant and it had been declining.  Not sure if we would go back anymore.."}
{"text":"Ordered home delivery via uber eats,the Uber service was fantastic  The food was very disappointing in fact irritating  We ordered a curry with chicken and there was very little skinny pieces of chicken in the cuuried dish of veggies  The curried lamb dish was very disappointing as there was two small pieces of lamb The sticky rice was rolled in a piece of saran wrap and was hard  as a rock How could anyone let that out of the kitchen then physically package it"}
{"text":"Update: I came back because I was told this restaurant is under new management so I wanted to give them a chance to win my heart over. Unfortunately, the new owner(s) failed. We came here two hours ago and there were no customers but we were starving and wanted to give them a chance. They told us to sit wherever we wanted so we sat at a booth. Another couple came right after us but the whole dining experience, service was lacking. They didn't offer a high chair so we asked for one. They were also playing 70s music which didn't fit right with the theme of their restaurant. We decided to order Thai iced teas, chicken red curry and beef Pad see ew. Our 7 month old loves to reach out her hands and was able to get the bowl of rice from our table as soon as it was served to us and dropped it. We were embarrassed, but even worse is that the server didn't seem too happy with what just happen. She took the broom and started sweeping and we were apologizing. She says \"that's ok\" and doesn't even offer another bowl of rice. Awkward...  Everything even the Thai tea was disappointing. The chicken in the curry was rubbery and dry, the curry had a weird aftertaste, and the beef in the noodles were also dry and tasted odd. We were so unhappy that we didn't ask for to go boxes to pack up the leftovers. Our bill was over $30 - definitely not worth it. I won't be back. Ever.  Original: This place is awful. I've tried to visit two different random times during lunch and both times, they were closed because the cook wasn't in or whatever lame excuse they gave me. I kind of understood the first time but the second time? And on both a Saturday?! How can they stay open if they can't even serve guests?"}
{"text":"They have a pretty good selection for lunch specials. Specials are until 3pm which is very good considering most places end their lunch specials sooner.    There are noodle options and dishes that come with soup, spring roll, and a side of rice.   I had the yellow curry chicken and it was pretty good. Not the best I had, but it was good  My friend had the curry noodles and she said she enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Food was good,  the waiter on the other hand was horrible.  We enjoy the spicy curry soup and the pad Thai was well done."}
{"text":"Good food!  Not the best atmosphere but what Thai restaurant has great atmosphere. Hot and sour soup superb as was garlic chicken. Very fresh veggies! Service was pushed to their limit or I would give it 5 stars"}
{"text":"This Thai Basil could very well be the best Thai in valley. The pad Thai are always on point with flavor and heat. Can't beat their lunch specials."}
{"text":"Granted the place was busy, but having to wait for my meal while my 2 friends had already finished is completely unacceptable to me. The flavor of th e food is fantastic, but don't go if there are more than 5 people inside.  In the end they comped the meal which was very nice"}
{"text":"Food is way over priced, 28.00 for a curry and coke? not very tasty and the meat was dry. Disappointment."}
{"text":"Generally, the food at this location is pretty good and rarely disappointing. Our favorite dishes here are the Drunken Noodles, Green Curry, and Pad Thai. The dine-in experience is pleasant with a clean atmosphere and a kind staff. Prices are reasonable and portions are adequate.   Perhaps though the most disappointing part of this business is the take-out. On multiple occasions (mainly during weekend hours), we've called for take-out and the phone just rings non-stop or the number isn't working (they give two phone numbers on their website). We have discussed the phone issue with the owner and the number that no longer works does in fact make mention in a message what number to call for service. Unfortunately though, we still have difficulty reaching this location via phone. Hopefully this issue gets resolved soon, we would definitely eat here more often if that were the case."}
{"text":"I ordered the Pad Thai with tofu. Very yummy! They asked on a scale of 1-5 how spicy I like it. I said a three. I loveee spicy foods but was nervous it would be too spicy. I'm glad I did! It was the perfect amount of spice. If you don't like your food spicy at all, I would say order a one. I'm sure the second level has a bit of kick to it.   The portion was large! I had enough for dinner and lunch, both satisfyingly full. The price point was pretty average. I think mine ended up costing $13, after taxes."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Love The Thai Basil Signature dish."}
{"text":"Last night in Phoenix and I decided to just wander into the first place I passed that looked good for dinner. I made a poor choice. The service was really bad (I feel like they are annoyed I'm here) and the food is really salty. Super disappointing."}
{"text":"First time here. It's was great the spicy garlic noodles were amazing! Will for sure be back soon!"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here. The tom kah soup is yummy. The rice the noodles! Yeah it's good.   I'd recommend it to anyone that enjoys Thai food.  It's pretty cool that they offer 20% off on orders for $50 or more."}
{"text":"Overall good food. Better than the surrounding Thai restaurants. I would definitely recommend it to other people. The service is quick and fast. The food is prepared quickly and the staff is nice and considerate towards the customers. For best experience go before it gets packed."}
{"text":"Good, but not great. Ordered Thai hot but there was zero heat. Seems like each location has a different cook method."}
{"text":"Very good/fast lunch without being fast food.  The food's good (although lately it's been less spicy, I think) . This restaurant's packed every day for lunch so that's a sign that their food's tasty. I always get the pad thai  and it's to die for!  The only  \"negative\" part about this restaurant's its size. It's ok for a small group but sometimes we're 10-15 people and we have to go somewhere else due to the fact that they can't accommodate a big group, which is sad because their food's very good and I know all of us really enjoy it."}
{"text":"Best food at the mall (though that's not saying a lot), decent outdoor seating area. If you are hungry, skip the food court and come here. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but it was good in a pinch."}
{"text":"I'm a fan for one reason: Mee Grob (aka: mi krop, mee krob). I cannot find this dish at most Thai restaurants in the valley, so I come here when I *need* Mee Grob...listed as \"crunchy noodles\" on their menu. They are ridiculously good.  Other than that, I've had good dishes here--pad see ew is the best I've had. I'd be a bigger fan if I hadn't found meat in my food once here after ordering a vegetarian dish. Made me wonder how well they cleaned their grill. Still...I go back for the Mee Grob!"}
{"text":"I have become a Thai addict thanks to this place!  Their curry is on point. My personal favorite is the Peanut Curry with chicken.  Service is always great! The people are very pleasant :)"}
{"text":"Came from out of town and really enjoyed our meal. Simple decor, but good food and great service."}
{"text":"My husband and I always go to thai restaurant. I love this place and definitely I recommend this place , we ordered path thai and chicken carry it was fabulous.  Hope you like and enjoy your thai food if you guys are going. Soooooo gooood :) :)"}
{"text":"Casual and good food. Very friendly staffs. The ice tea was really good, not to sweet \" just perfect\". My husband and I had the eggplant and masaman curry dishes for lunch, it was good."}
{"text":"Vegan review: I've eaten at various Thai Basil locations previously, including this one, and have asked if the curries are veg/vegan and been told yes. On my most recent visit, the server checked with the cook (thankfully) and confirmed that the curries have fish sauce, but the stir fries other than pad Thai would be entirely plant-based if ordered with tofu/veggies. I've pretty much given up getting Thai curry at most places now except for Chon Thai, which goes out of its way to make sure the curries are vegetarian/free of any seafood ingredients. I wasn't too hungry anyway, so I just ordered the fresh rolls with no shrimp.  The fresh rolls were a disappointment. They were mostly iceberg lettuce with a bit of unflavored, uncooked tofu. The sauce wasn't what I'd consider to be a peanut sauce - it was more of a thick sweet and sour sauce with crushed peanuts on top. I won't be ordering them again. I've had the red curry and the panang before and liked them, but didn't realize I was eating fish sauce.  My dining companions got a few items that were vegan and looked good -  both were stir fried noodle dishes with tofu but I don't remember what they were called. I think one was the Pad See Ew and the other was the silver noodles but am not certain. My friends said they were okay but not great.  Service was prompt and friendly - no issues. In short - it's an okay place in a pinch, but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Just missed lunch !      Drunken NOODLES excellent !     While I was there FOOD TOUR GROUP came through...I  gathered that this tour group was a tasting group of different ethnic foods in Downtown Phoenix vicinity.  If BASIL was the representative of THAI food - that alone says much about the quality here as there seems to be a lot of competition !"}
{"text":"Thanks to reading the other posts we were already prepared for less than stellar service but to be honest..good food trumps bad service any day.  WE were NOT disappointed!  Food was great and although it was tamed down a little too much for my liking (Spicy levels), we were able to juice it up with the proper sauce tray that had chili paste and chile oil.   Service was a little slow and disorganized but our server and others there were VERY friendly and went out of their way to make sure that we enjoyed our meal.   We will be going back soon...especially since our waitress informed us that they will be adding a sushi bar in the next few weeks!  Obviously going a little off the \"thai food\" route but who doesn' t like sushi?!"}
{"text":"We used to love this place, but the food and service have gone way downhill on our last few visits. We'll find somewhere else to eat next time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai Restaurant!  Rama's favorites is a yummy way to get vegetables. Best drunken noodles I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"said pickup would be ready at 7:30. now almost 8 and a bunch of people are sitting and waiting at the bar in the same situation. food is normally good so 3 stars for now but taking 1 star away for every 10 minutes late starting now."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai place I've had. YUM We stopped by for dinner on Saturday night after the show at Comerica theatre. The place was packed but the service was still great.  Once we sat down they greeted us and poured us glasses of water and handed us menus. We were then ready to order. I ordered the Pineapple fried rice with beef, and then my friend got the Spicy fried rice with shrimp and opted to remove bell peppers. Both dishes were amazing and decent size. The spicy level was just perfect.  Got to show how much I like the food here, felt like what I had in Thailand 7 years back. Very impressed! keep up good work, will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Being from Hawai'i, where you can get really good Thai food, I am so happy I found this place! I went to the Scottsdale-Pinnacle Peak location; they have 4 locations: Chandler, Downtown Phoenix, Ahwatukee and Scottsdale.   I ordered take out lunch (in person) and the staff was so friendly! They gave me a cup of soup and water while I waited for my order of Som Tum (Green Papaya Salad) and Yum Woon Sen (Bean Thread Noodle Salad). Both were delicious. I ordered them medium spicy, which wasn't too spicy; I may order it spicier next time.  This restaurant has sticky rice. It is so hard to find a Thai restaurant in town that offers sticky rice as a side, and not just as a dessert.   Try them out, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I visited at about 6:30 on a week night. There were no customers in the restaurant, which is always a bad sign. I mean absolutely no customers. I walked in and wandered around until I caught someone's attention. He seated me, and asked if I would like a drink. I ordered a beer, and he returned with it shortly. Unfortunately, he never returned to take my order. I saw him wandering around on his cell phone, but saw nobody else. After at least 10 - 15 minutes, I got up and started looking around. I found a guy at the bar, and asked him how much I owed for the beer. He seemed shocked to see me. About this time the waiter appeared, and told the guy at the bar I had a beer. I asked him why he never returned to take my order, his response was a blank stare with no words. The guy at the bar apologized and offered to take my order. The waiter is still standing there saying nothing. I declined to order, repeating that I had been ignored too long in a restaurant with absolutely no customers. I mean zero, other than me. I told the guy at the bar I was no longer interested and I was surprised he was charging me for the half drank beer. He said he was only an employee and could do nothing. Who knows if the food is any good, because they won't serve it. Maybe this place isn't a real business? Not sure how they can keep the doors open? Never going back!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try Thai Basil the other night.  We arrived at what should have been the end of a dinner rush.  The place was empty.  There was one other occupied table when we arrived, but they appeared to be employees eating after their shift.  The place looks nice, but the booths are uncomfortable. The seats feel more shallow than standard sized seats.  The service was acceptable, but not great.  I was unhappy with my dish, and the server did not offer to adjust or change it.  I ordered a masaman  curry, which is usually very mild compared to other curries.  This was not mild at all.  It was so spicy that I could only eat about half a cup.  Masaman curry is supposed to be made with coconut, cinnamon, lemongrass, ginger, cloves and other sweet strong spices.  My dish tasted exactly like a panang curry.  Masaman is coconut based, and panang is peanut based.  They should not taste the same.  The dish was flavorful, but not the right flavors for a masaman curry.  I'm certain that my friend enjoyed the signature dish more than I enjoyed mine.  She also only ate a small amount and took the rest to go.  Dinner with a shared appetizer, beverage and dessert will cost close to $30 while lunch specials will bring the meal price down closer to $15"}
{"text":"I had wonton soup and it was delicious from this Scottdale location. Their chowmein is fantastic.  It isnt too crowded for us when we walk in for lunch or dinner and I absolutely love the mango coconut ice cream that they serve. The staff is always friendly and welcoming and I would go there for lunch or dinner anytime and very soon. The staff here is attentive, fast and do not make you feel you have to rush at eating and leaving."}
{"text":"Even though they SAY they deliver to my zone - turns out they don't.  Thanks SO VERY MUCH for wasting my time.  It would have been nice to know that before I spent my time placing and order and inputting my credit card info.  If you want delivery CALL to place your order and ASK before you waste your time trying to do it online."}
{"text":"I saw the rating and went. They have very mild flavor in all their dishes. Am not taking about the spice level... the flavor of fried rice is so mild that you feel like may you are eating plain rice with some aroma and lil sauce in it.  It's very close to our place so was very excited seeing the rating in yelp. Will try it again since it's close but would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"I ordered take out from Thai Basil tonight.  It was my first experience eating their food.  Yum!  I have specific dietary concerns and they were accommodating, helpful, and friendly.  I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Very nice people. Good service. Drunken noodles spiced 2+ on a scale of 1 to 3 were great. Very fresh ingredients. Tasty crab puffs. My wife enjoyed chicken noodles. The sticky rice served too early and rates 1star. Overall a place I will happily return to."}
{"text":"For PHX/Scottsdale, I would say it was above average, but do not order out unless you want to wait 2 hours."}
{"text":"I have dined at Thai Basil Signature numerous times over the past 5 years, so here goes. Several years ago I loved the food there. The place was run by a man who had lived in Phuket and they cooked some great Thai food. Under the latest ownership it is safe to say the food and experience is hit and miss.  I do enjoy the Pad Thai. The fresh rolls with peanut sauce are good. The tom-kai soup is good. What has really not performed well are the curries - if you order to go they give you what appears to be a huge plastic container filed with curry. The problem is, 90% of the volume is water - there is very little food in there. The meat portion equals about a tablespoon. On top of that they serve it with a tiny amount of rice. Dining there once I asked for more rice and was charged an additional dollar. Considering I was spending $60 for the two of us this seemed excessive. I enjoy my curry and I hope they can make it without it being the consistency of soup. It looks nothing like it does in the photos which feature plates full of brimming vegetables and large chunks of meat."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! We just moved to Phoenix and have been searching for a great Thai restaurant that might compare to our beloved Saps Fine Thai in Texas. We've tried a few that were a major let down. A friend recommended Thai Basil to us so we decided to try it. We went on a Sunday at 3:00 so we were the only people in there, but the service was great and the food was DELICIOUS and spicy, which is what seems to be lacking from the other places we've tried. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"They have the best Pad Thai I have ever had. I have grown up in the valley only going to the pricey Mailees on Maine for Thai food. Last night we randomly decided to check out Thai Basil and it has blown Mailees out of the water with their great prices and taste. I'm addicted and will be returning... A lot."}
{"text":"Yum! Pad Thai with tofu is my go to and it has never done me wrong. The workers here are very friendly and accommodating. I ordered over the phone before I came in on my lunch break and my food was ready on time. Superb."}
{"text":"Thai Basil offers great food at economical price. The food is fresh and always taste good. They are very generous with their portion size and the staff members are always so compassionate and friendly. Even when they are having a bad day. It's been a while since I have been here. I highly recommend Thai Basil! Thank you for your time."}
{"text":"Worst place ever, drove a good distance to try their food, blatantly ignored by employees for over 5 minutes, service is really bad, I left and went somewhere else don't waste your time, support business that support consumers!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great service. Their curry's are outstanding! Have eaten there about 8 times."}
{"text":"I'm a creature of habit. I always order the red chicken curry. It has great flavor and decent portions for lunch. The place can be quite crowded during lunch hours. Service sometimes can leave a little to be desired."}
{"text":"So, if you can find this place your are a modern day Columbus. If you are not a history making captain, then good luck. And if you sail into this restaurant by accident - enjoy. Didn't make it to eating the food.   Maps says I'm a 10 minute walk away yet I'm sitting in their booth."}
{"text":"I finally made it up to try since Thai Pan was sold.  Let me start by saying that I was a very big fan of Thai Pan and thought the owners did a wonderful job.  Why they sold, who knows.  Thai Basil is okay, but I am willing to go back and give them a couple more tries because I think that they are just getting settled in.  The ordering process is different than before.  You no longer go up to the counter and order.  Instead they come around to the tables.  The problem is that there were only two women there today and they were taking orders and running the food.  It took a little while before our orders were taken.  The tables were all pretty dirty and I didn't even want to rest my arms on them because they were sticky.  I am hopeful that they will resolve that problem quickly.  Lunch specials come with a salad which has a really nice dressing on it.  I have never had a spicy salad dressing, but I liked it a lot.  I had the Ginger Chicken and was glad to see actual pieces of ginger.  However, the portions are on the small side (compared to Thai Pan).  They aren't as good as Thai Pan was, but I will definitely go back when they are more comfortable with their new operation."}
{"text":"So happy to see Thai Basil open at PV Mall. We had dinner there last night and it was awesome!!!  The red curry is my favorite but everything was great, as was the service. I will be going there often."}
{"text":".Fell in love with Pad Thai in Thailand so I had to try it here.  Not bad.  Still not so good as a mere 23 hour flight away at a small restaurant in Chang Mai (northern Thailand), but pretty darn good here for sure. Also ordered a curry here, which I found really good for curry which I don't normally like at all.   Love this place and will be back.  Plus, were here after the Phoenix Art Museum movie and walking around looking at the art on a Sunday, so it's open to 9 pm at least."}
{"text":"Thai Basil is right across the street from my work and I finally went yesterday.  Cute atmosphere. Lunch specials were a good value. The starter salad, although consisting of only lettuce, had a very tasty dressing.   I ordered green curry with tofu and vegetables. One reason I ordered it was because of the great selection of veggies including broccoli and green beans it says it comes with on the menu. However it only came with onions, a ton of carrots, undercooked potato, and a couple pieces of eggplant. I was so sad! The curry itself was tasty, with a perfect medium spice. But I can't get over how many vegetables were omitted in the dish. Just unexcusable.  Service was okay. Pleasant enough but we did have to wait a bit to get our check. I probably won't return, unless coming with friends or coworkers. I prefer Vegan House."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Tried them on uber eats and the yellow curry was more like soup than sauce. Starving and ignorant ordered again and the soup was not even edible and the garlic veggie dish was almost flavorless. Poor excuse for Thai food,  I want my money back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I can't give a ZERO but I called with 2 hours of anticipation and let them know we had a party of 15 coming. They advised ok we'll be ready. When we arrived (20 minutes early) to let them know we were coming, not only did they not know but after an hour of sitting there and seating ourselves we eventually got up and left. Poor service, unorganized and the manager was less then helpful."}
{"text":"I love Thai Basil Signature, not only is the food delicious but service is always spot on. I am a sucker for good spring rolls, that thin deep fried tofu skin, the rice noodles, and veggies... and let me tell you theirs don't disappoint. Their peanut (panag) curry is yummy and I adore their pad see ew noodles! My go to local Thai joint!"}
{"text":"I work just around the corner from this place, had today for lunch. I got a simple order of Pad Thai with Shrimp at medium level heat. It was quite delicious, portion to was pretty big I had to save some for later. The noodles, veggies, egg were all cooked well and the shrimp (tail on) were succulent and they gave quite a bit. I will be coming back to try other dishes as well as their spring rolls"}
{"text":"I can't understand why this place was as quiet as it was, but I'm glad for it...  The food was great. The service was excellent. Our waiter gave great recommendations, and took care of the whole front of house inside and on the patio.   We will certainly be back here again. And soon."}
{"text":"Pedestrian and boring Thai food for the masses. If your idea of exotic is Pad Thai, then this is the place for you. No heat, no flavour, no imagination.  Server lacked enthusiasm, obviously a common trend here throughout the restaurant."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good dinner with your family. This is a excellent place to go to. Very excellent service and very good food. I don't know how but this people work fast."}
{"text":"This is a good spot. Service was decent. Ordered the Thai Basil extra spice which I found to be very good."}
{"text":"Wow!  The lack of Service was incredible!  The waiter, Raul, was too busy doing something on the computer to clean the table, bring water or drinks. His attitude was pure &@%#%&.   When our food came we had to ask for plates and eating utensils.  He then went back to the computer instead of bringing us forks.    The food itself was average at best. We ask for spicy hot and we received lukewarm.  No spice. When it came time to ask for the check, again he was too busy on the computer to pick it up and run our card.  The next time I am in the area, I will eat at in and out burger."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Had the spicy chicken noodle lunch special, great flavors, great price super quick service. Nice and clean restaurant. Wonderful option downtown. Service was prompt and friendly and lots of parking options nearby."}
{"text":"This place is the best kept secret over the lunch hour! The food was excellent, the most amazing thai ice tea. I've been to central phoenix thai basil, and the one in Tempe...this location has them beat."}
{"text":"Havent had Thai in 2 years and was craving some pad thai. Closest one to my house was this place so decided to check it out. It was pretty good...not too oily with perfect spice. Loved the tofu with chicken. Will def order again and try some other dishes."}
{"text":"Good flavors, ordered Thai hot and the waiter gave me a funny look but didn't ask anything else.  I then received food that was mild at best."}
{"text":"Best place to eat Thai in AZ! My favorites are Pad Thai, Nam Sad, Tom Kah, and Pad Broccoli. The place is about 1100 sq feet but has a cool relaxed feel and if you want, you can order in advance and just pick it up-no delivery."}
{"text":"Great place! I live really close to the paradise valley mall. Amazing pad Thai! The service was amazing I don't know what these other reviewers are talking about!"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been by this place a number of times and always said we wanted to try it. Well, we finally did before our movie. The decor is so-so, and there is a full bar crammed in the back. The restaurant was very clean and void of patrons other than us and another couple.  I had the Drunken Noodles. They were good but nothing spectacular in the taste department. The portion was a fair size and price. We split a pot of green tea, which turned out to be Lipton brand and very pricy. We switched to the loose leaf jasmine tea. It tasted better but was still pricy.  Overall, a solid 3-stars. There are plenty of Thai places in the Valley and probably won't be returning here any time soon."}
{"text":"I ordered from Thai Basil (2 orders of pad Thai) and when it arrived and hour and a half later the driver wouldn't give it to me even though my card had been charged. he said he wouldn't give it to me because there was no tip on the card.  I always tip 30-40% no matter what service I get because I've been a server, I know it's tougher than heck to make good money. But he flat out refused to give me my food with out his tip first. I had a 10$ bill in my hand for him but his attitude was so appalling that I said no, please give me my food. He walked away, with my pad Thai.   I called the restaurant over and over asking to speak to a manager. Never was put through and never got my food. I will never order from this place again. Ever. I want my money back since I never got my food, and for some one to please tell that driver he can't treat people that way."}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Service is incredibly bad. Confused. Disorganized. Carry out is the way to go."}
{"text":"I ordered drunken noodles to-go and wasn't at all impressed with the quality of food I received. The dish lacked a lot of flavor and the portion size seemed quite small for a dinner portion of food. I've eaten at many other Thai restaurants, including other places in the area, ordering drunken noodles just about every place I go, and while it wasn't the absolute worst Thai food I've ever had, it definitely wasn't even close to being a contender for the best... would not recommend."}
{"text":"Quick -fresh-delicious! Great curries and Thai basil The Green Curry with Chicken is a favorite!"}
{"text":"Salad wad great curry great pad Thai the worst I've ever had. Over cooked no bean sprouts nuts wereover diced served lemon not lime. Only two people working service they tried there best did what they could.  Was so disappointed. My fiends first time wanted the best. Wont go back."}
{"text":"Food was decent albeit small portions but the service was terrible. Waited 30 minutes for a glass of water and to have my order taken. Only one waitstaff during lunch hours. They need to fix this or they will lose business."}
{"text":"It should have been a red flag that the whole restaurant was empty. The food was awful, dry rice noodles with no flavor. The service was awful Considering we were the only ones there. I didn't eat more than one bite and not one of the staff said - is everything ok? Awful!"}
{"text":"I am from Thailand and ate here today. The food is very very good, very authentic Thai food. Every day they have special menus with many interesting and delicious food."}
{"text":"Delicious thai food ! We order the panang chicken and pad thai and both are super yummy. The place is consistently good!"}
{"text":"Had the pad Thai on lunch hour during rotations. It was ok but not the best I've ever had. The service was awesome tho. I would recommend this place if you're in the area but I wouldn't travel to eat here."}
{"text":"I have to day that this is the best Thai food in town. I do not know why anyone would eat Thai any place else!"}
{"text":"My mouth watered as I looked at everything on the menu. It all sounded so good. I decided on the Thai Basil Signature dish, thinking it had to be special. My husband got the Dan Dan noodles. I was not very impressed with either. Not much flavor to me. I did like my husband's dish more though. I am hoping to try this place again but get something different, maybe it was an off night. The service was very friendly."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in north Phoenix.  The eggplant garlic is so flavorful with or without spice.  The waiter Raul is friendly and hospitable.  When craving Thai or want a reasonable culinary experience, visit Thai Basel at PV Mall."}
{"text":"Wrong address on Yelp. Not near the 101. Lady on phone acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. Had to call and wait on hold for 15 minutes to get a refund."}
{"text":"Food was five star. Service was five star. Billing was the issue. Went for lunch, midweek. Our server was \"B\", he was awesome, very conscientious, prompt and thorough. I asked for mustard sauce for the yummy crispy veggie rolls. He offered the chili sauce as an alternative and I LOVED it. I would have bought a bottle to go. The pad Thai was so delicious that I ate too much. I had tofu, that could have been a bit more generous. My gf had pad Thai with shrimp, also delicious. The bill arrived w different prices from the menu. We inquired. \"B\" asked the boss lady. She pulled out a to go style menu with the prices we were charged but were clearly higher than the menus on the table. We did not want to argue with our lovely and kind young man so we paid. See pics of the menu on the table and the bill. We will go back, but dig our heels in if the bill doesn't match the presented menu prices."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in the valley. Always prompt service, in the hundreds of visits I have made here, they have never once made a mistake in any order I have gotten. The pad thai is so freaking delicious, and gotta get it 3 times thai hot! Everyone who works here is so nice and funny. I remember around the holidays hearing one of their employees singing christmas carols and it was adorable. Try this place if you want some delicious, authentic thai. Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Great food. Portions way too small. Very authentic as good as being in Thailand!"}
{"text":"Visited during lunch time on a Wed.  It was not busy, seated quickly and food came out really fast. Ordered the chicken curry & shrimp pad Thai. Both were delicious. Will definitely return to try out more dishes."}
{"text":"I visited this place twice during my visit in Phoenix. Nice place, tasty food, very accurate and responsible staff."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I was on a business trip and I wanted Thai and came across this gem. The Thad Pak and drunken noodles were so good! The owner, Patrida came over and talked to me and asked how everything was. Customer service was on point. The portions were good too. I loved how I didn't get food coma afterwards too. I will be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Thai Basil a couple of times and have yet to be disappointed. Both times I got the red curry, can't bring myself to try anything else because it is so good! I like spicy, but not painfully spicy, and this dish has the perfect amount of spice for me. There is a wide variety on the menu, and it is not overly pricey. I see reviews saying the portions are too small, however, I have not experienced that issue. I have only been there for dinner though so that could be why. I do have one complaint on the service though. My boyfriend was looking for an alcoholic drink to try, and just the names are listed on the menu, not what was in each drink. Out of curiosity, he asked out server what was in a Mai Tai and she responded \"I don't know\" then just sort of guessed what was in it. You would think she could have just checked with the bartender, then got back to us. The service was mostly good otherwise though. Overall, this place is pretty good, would come again!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food. The atmosphere left something to be desired, as well as the late 90's pop music, but nothing that would keep us from coming back. We will definitely be back next time we are in town.  The 'hot' definitely took a bite out of my mother-in-law who likes spicy food. They also have a 'thai hot' that should really get you. We found the food rich and flavorful unlike some places where the flavors are watered down. We enjoyed the spring rolls, tom kha soup (chicken), curry noodles (chicken), garlic saute (chicken), and thai iced tea. All were excellent."}
{"text":"I LOVE THE POTSTICKERS, they are totally yummy.  I work near by so I pick them up for lunch a lot.  I've had the drunken noodles a couple of times and would also recommend that.  I get take out mostly but have dined in a few times and service is usually pretty good even during their lunch rush.  If you do get take out they really package everything nicely.  The only thing I haven't liked so far is the Signature Fresh Rolls, they're huge but really loosely wrapped and really bland.  Total bummer!  I would steer clear of them but the rest is definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken curry massaman and it was very good. You can get the spice level to your liking, which I did medium and it was perfect. Also ordered the fried sweet potatoes and the chili sauce that came with it was great too. The veggies in the curry are a little undercooked but still good. My friend ordered pad Thai and it was just okay. Service was great and saved this place from like a 3.5 to a 4."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch around 11am & it got busy after that. We had pad Thai & Thai fried rice & Thai tea. The pad Thai chicken was too sweet of sugar taste & the noodle tastes like under cook, still chewy. The fried rice wasn't good too. The Thai tea was the way too sweet. The food here didn't taste good at some point besides fresh chili fish sauce and good customer service to make me feel better. It s hard to find a good Thai food in Phoenix since I have tried 4 other restaurants in the area near by Chandler with the high review. I will get back to LA for my favorite Thai restaurants there soon."}
{"text":"I cannot believe a restaurant  this good is attached to PV Mall.  I went for lunch and had the Coconut Soup. I cannot recall the Thai name for it. But it was fantastic. My friend enjoyed the Green Curry with Chicken.  His dish was just as good.  I went back the next day and ordered the Green curry to go.  They even give a mall discount. I wish them great success and enjoy the location and food."}
{"text":"Food was nasty. Had to walk to front every time I need something. Chef need to learn how to cook thai food. It was not thai food. Duck was old. .."}
{"text":"Food ok, very fried.  Ordered on yelp and got home wrong order.  Called back and it took awhile but finally came back and said there was an error.   I was welcome to come back.  I do not eat beef but too far.  I asked for a credit and they said I need to talk to manager and call back in 10.  Called back and had to explain whole story, now the manager saiid I did on line and it said Beef.  After they admitted the mistake.  They said I can get a credit but would not go back.  She said it was to hard to refund and something about 30%.  Food fair and they did not earn my business to try again."}
{"text":"I. Am. Obsessed. I can't get enough of this place. I usually get the green or red curry and always order double Thai hot. First off, this is probably the first place in my life that doesn't question it every time and then still give me a medium-level spicy dish. secondly, they're service is always good and every staff member I have encountered is friendly and happy. They have free wifi happy hour specials for food and beer/wine. Great place!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I have been looking for a great Thai place. We were going to Thai Elephant before and it was pretty good but there wasn't a close location so we decided to give Thai Basil a shot.  We are very glad we did.   We got the standard pad Thai, a yellow curry, a coconut milk soup of some sort, and then we tried a new item. It was called a Sweet Nut Curry and it was freaking delicious. Think a mix between your favorite curry and peanut butter chicken from a Chinese restaurant... Yum! (The peanuty flavor was very much more mild than peanut butter chicken though - fear not!)  For all this (which was really a ridiculous amount of food for two people) we only paid $36 and we had enough food to last us for two or three meals at least. On top of that our order was ready for pick up within ten minutes. We will definitely be returning and probably trying a few new items based on how good our first experience was. If you're looking for good Thai in North Scottsdale you could do a lot worse than Thai Basil."}
{"text":"Do not go here in the summer after the mall closes. They have NO air conditioning and they serve sushi while it is unbearably hot in the restaurant. This can not be ok if a restaurant inspector were to come in. They need to put giant commercial size fans in the restaurant or keep the hours of the mall. The wine they served smelt like nail polish remover. We had to get another glass. The next glass was from a new bottle and was still awful. I'm wondering if they keep their wine in a temperature controlled environment? It can't be good for wine to go up and down in temperature. The food was 2 stars. They filled up the chicken dishes with vegetables in order to give you less meat. The service was ok. They barely spoke English. The loud Asian music they had playing was awful. I will never go back."}
{"text":"To say I had an incredibly Frustrating and drawn out ordeal with this location would be an understatement.   Let me preface with the fact that I'm a huge fan of the other thai basil locations and will continue to frequent the other locations. I will never go back to this location despite how close it is to me and how excited I was that it opened.  I ordered pick up to take to my girlfriend as a nice gesture to save her from cooking dinner. When I got to her house and opened our order (chicken pad Thai and beef green curry- our go to every time at every location) and there was one piece of meat in the curry. One whole piece. There were zero pieces of chicken in the pad Thai.   I figured I must have picked up the wrong food so I called them back. The managerTo say I have had an incredibly Frustrating ordeal with this location would be a severe understatement.   Let me preface with the fact that I'm huge fan of thai basil and will continue to frequent the other locations. I will never go back to this location.   I order pick up everytime and the first two times everything was fine. The third time, I ordered pick to take to my girlfriend as a nice gesture to save her from cooking dinner. When I got to her house and opened our order (chicken pad Thai and beef green curry) and there was one piece of meat in the curry. One whole piece. There were zero pieces of chicken in the pad Thai. I figured I must have picked up the wrong food so I called them back. The manager apologized and said next meal would be comped since I didn't have time to go back and have them  apologized and said the next full order would be comped since I didn't have time to go back and have them remake it. Reasonable solution in my opinion and I was happy again.  I asked the manager to please make sure her team knew about our meal and she assured me I wouldn't have any issues redeeming my meals when I called back.  Two weeks later, I decided to take thai basil up on the standing offer. Except no one knew what I was talking about when I called in. The man I spoke with said he'd have to call the manager to check and would call me back. No call after an hour so I called again. He said she remembered only one of our entrees having a mistake. I was frustrated and gave him my contact info to have the manager call me directly.  She never called me back so I called again a few days later and I had got the same \"I have to check with the manager\" from a girl this time, followed by no phone call, so I called back again 30 minutes later. Same story about one meal so again I gave this girl  my contact info and let her know I expected a call back this time. Again, no call.  My ask was very reasonable- a simple call back so we could have a conversation about this specific incidence and the manager either felt it was unnecessary or the staff did not inform her. Either way the service is inexcusable and for a new location that is constantly empty, this is not the way to win over repeat customers."}
{"text":"I truly LOVE Thai food and I am disappointed.  I ordered their signature thai basil at a level 5 spice.  The chicken was dry and flavorless.  I didn't see any chili peppers anywhere.  The rice was dry and burnt.  My colleague ordered the Pad Thai. She said the chicken was dry and the dish was bland.  We will not be coming back here again.."}
{"text":"Wow, 2 spoonfuls of rice in my to-go order and an extremely hot panang curry when I asked for mild. I can't eat this, and I'm already back at work so I can't go return it.  I thought having competition nearby (Thai'd Up, Thai Elephant, Thai Hut), would make you work harder for my patronage. I guess not."}
{"text":"Very average. This restaurant is set up for lunch business.  That being said the quality is sub par and after trying twice and both times my order was wrong, I would recommend something else."}
{"text":"Always consistently good. Portions are large and the curries are great. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"So good! I've been trying to find a good thai place since I moved to Arizona and it was delicious! I had the chicken pad thai and requested that it be made as spicy as possible - and they definitely listened. So glad I found a good thai restaurant. Will be returning."}
{"text":"This is a great Thai food restaurant. My husband and I have been here a few times and have been very pleased with the food, as well as the service. We usually order a few curries and of course the pad Thai. The food is always consistently good. Good Thai food is sometimes hard to find, you definitely won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Not too bad for a quick lunch, but I've had much better for the same price or less. Menus are greasy, silverware does not inspire much confidence either - use chopsticks. Food is ok, but they drown it in sauce even though I asked it to be on a dry side. Can't remark on anything special as nothing stood out."}
{"text":"I came here with a decent sized group for a dinner. We made reservations a week ahead of time so they expected our arrival.   We were promptly greeted and asked for our drink orders. The waitress was taken aback that we were ordering wine by the bottle. She confirmed several times and then clarified once again before opening it at the table. It was pretty comical but there were 4 of us having wine so it was the economical thing to do.   Our table of 5 split a few starters (potstickers, spring rolls, and fried shrimp & vegetables) that seemed like frozen appetizers they popped in a fryer. It all tasted good but nothing special.  Pad thai at level 3 was pretty darn good and perfectly spiced for me. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals (green curry, seafood combination, etc.)  Overall good experience but nothing I'd go out of my way for. I'm not familiar with the Thai scene in AZ but it seems like they have a lot of local competition to deal with."}
{"text":"Surprised to find that this location was open Sunday evening. A pleasant place, with good curry."}
{"text":"The service was good and the wait staff was friendly and efficient.  I had the traditional pad thai - there were just a few small pieces of tofu and chicken and it was quite 'saucy' with more vinegar than I prefer."}
{"text":"I've been passing this place for years and since i love Thai food, i thought finally, a chance to try it out.  Now I know it's hard to bash a place that has multiple locations and been around awhile so maybe it was an off night but... the crazed anticipation i was experiencing was replaced with a really mediocre meal.  I LOVE great hot and sour soup. The spiciness, the heat, the mixed flavors of spices and veggies and meat, the texture which is smooth yet lingers....but $10 for 30 ounces of blandness wasn't my goal. That's $42 a gallon for what was basically peppery water laced with too many HUGE pieces of tomato and mushrooms with a very few pieces of meat. It was not a great hot and sour soup and was more a tomato chunk laden broth. I've got to say that Flo's still makes the best  And I was ready to sink my teeth into their \"Signature Dish\" as again, Thai food is supposed to be bold and exciting and an experience to be remembered long after leaving the table. And... your signature dish should represent your finest effort.  I'm guessing that the person who developed this \"Signature\" dish couldn't write. It was really bland, without character, without any punch and the pork was chewy and bereft of any sense of culinary fun and quality. Really... a signature dish?   And realizing there are some spices used that have remaining elements, the amount of twigs and roughage in this was most interesting. The menu forgot to tell me that it came with its own toothpicks.  Anyhow, I never want to be unfair and there may, MAY, be a second chance for this place but in reading other reviews i see I'm not alone in the evaluation of my \"blandness\" meter. Anyone can have an off night but there seems to have been several in the recent past.  Living in Cave Creek and enjoying some time and wine next door makes this place convenient but... with one more visit to be fair....if it doesn't make then i'll be scratching this off my \"got to\" list as well.  There are too many food choices in town including other Thai and great Chinese to spend time and money where it goes into some R&D and quality ingredients."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I live 2 minutes away for PV mall. We are Thai lovers and could have it pretty much all the time. Our staples are the yellow curry w/ tofu and pad see eew. We have also had the pad Thai, red, and green curry. All delicious. One time, we ordered the veg spring rolls...I don't recommend. Those tasted like they were frozen and from a box.   There's never really a lot of dine in at the restaurant. We've done dine in and take out. I prefer take out, only cause I just love being able to eat up at home and then laze around on my couch. My take out experiences have been amazing - they take virtually no time at all to cook up our meals. One time we called to order, immediately left our house for the mall, and our order was ready by the time we got there.  We definitely want to try other Thai places in the neighborhood, but Thai basil, so far, has fulfilled our curry and noodle cravings."}
{"text":"This is a great Thai restaurant in North Scottsdale.  Great food and friendly service... I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ordered an eggplant with tofu and specifically asked if it is vegetarian without any meat or fish. Found couple of shirmp shells in the dish. Thank you for experience. Would never ever trust these people again."}
{"text":"Yummy and fast lunch for a good price  Stopped in for some Thai for lunch.  This place is across from the Wells Fargo building and gets a good business crowd.  Very friendly young people took our order and bussed the table.  Did a good job of keeping drinks filled throughout the meal.  I also liked that they made sure I wanted real spiciness for my meal. So many restaurants are timid with the heat.  Maybe I looked non-pale enough that they believed I could handle it.    An \"adult\" came and served us our meal.  Excellent curry and noodle dishes.  And the spice was there as desired in my dish-- just the right level to give some heat while not totally overpowering the flavors.  Eggroll and soup were only okay, though.  My associate and I came away thinking the service, value, speed, and food were worth the visit.  We'll stop by, again."}
{"text":"My friend and I were craving some Thai Iced Tea and Thai Curry - luckily this place was open until 9:30pm.   We felt bad going relatively close to closing time but we got in around 8:40pm and tried to get out of there as fast as possible. The waitresses were nice and accommodating.   The Yellow Curry was delicious! I liked their yellow Curry more than Thai Elephant Bistro's.   Definitely will be back again!"}
{"text":"I love Thai food.  This place has the best Pad Thai any where  near here.  My new favorit place for Thai in the north valley.   So happy they opened up here."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here many times and the food is pretty good. This was the third time however I ordered my food online and it was not ready when they said and I waited 15 minutes for my to go order. I was amazed they continue to not come through with the online orders and I have never once been offered any compensation or apology which is not acceptable customer service. If they are going to take place in the online ordering they need to be accountable for it and be on time. On top of waiting an extra 20 minutes they still seemed to have rushed my order and it was not to the quality I normally get here. I eat here at least once a week and this experience makes me not want to come back."}
{"text":"Great Thai food, great Thai iced tea, and a great waiter named Raul made it a great night with my lady! :) the food was just spicy enough and very plentiful for the price! Keep it up guys! Definitely a good restaurant with very fast service."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good thai food. It's nothing out of this world, but it's consistent. They will make their dishes as hot as you like, if you're feeling dangerous."}
{"text":"This is my second time here. I ordered shrimp tom yum, mild. I can't do spicy. It was good. Can't complain. I love the Thai tea. I always order Thai tea at those boba places but this place has the real deal.   My husband ordered chicken pad Thai. He's really picky, like a steak and potatoes type so it's hard for him to try Asian places. He said this was really good.   My friend ordered Panang curry with brown rice. She said it's supposed to taste exactly like that. If she were ever sick, I know this is what she would want to order.   Service was very friendly and ambience is very casual but romantic."}
{"text":"Not really A-OK, more like just OK.   Last night I really didn't feel like cooking after a long day at work so we decided to give Thai Basil a try rather than heading out to our regular Thai place, Thai House. We should have went to Thai House.  The biggest issue I had with Thai Basil is they were understaffed and that seems to be a recurring issue here. When we walked in there were three people in line at the counter and five more groups of people sitting at tables. No one or nothing to direct us so we stood in line only to find out since we wanted to dine in we should sit down and a server would take our order.  Unfortunately there was only one server and he seemed to be new and was literally running around the restaurant.Very polite and very nice, jut not efficient.  The food was just okay, nothing special and the restaurant as a whole seemed unkempt. They need to get their act together before I'll be back."}
{"text":"I am an American but I spend a lot of time in Thailand. This food below is from a special menu and it is unbelievably delicious. This is an excellent restaurant and I'll plan to come back many times."}
{"text":"This place was terrible! Took forever to get our food, which came out cold. Never again!"}
{"text":"Food is really good especially the papaya salad!  Super fresh and authentic.  My only issue was that during our meal they were cleaning up.  The mopping in particular bothered me only because the cleaner they used was really strong and I am not fan of sniffing pine sol during any meal.  :/."}
{"text":"We wandered to this spot when after looking on google. After looking at the decor we realized this wasn't related to our favorite spot Thai Basil in Tempe.   I ordered my must have pad thai here. We were seated 4 people to a small table. Our orders came out on large plates that made the table arrangement feel small & awkward.   My pad thai chicken was way too sweet they poured a ton of the sauce... it was almost soupy. It tasted  better when I put the lime. We were very hungry but this is one of the only times I cosodered sending back an order. The thai basil on Tempe in comparison does pad thai better. My friends got the Pad See Ew and those came out well, so the quality depends on what you order."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for many years but it has really gone downhill since changed ownership.  The menu they post online has a discrepancy with the restaurant's menu.  So if you order anything to go chances are they'll screw it up royally! On top of that they will be rude about it and not fix things, even though it's their mistake. So prepare to eat food you don't want ! The food is so-so at best at this point and I won't be coming back. Save yourself the trouble and order from pei Wei!"}
{"text":"Picked up some panang curry for lunch since it's right down the street from work. I try to always order the panang at least once from every Thai place as a gauge. The lunch special said it comes with an egg roll and soup or salad in the summer. I got the egg roll but didn't receive salad or soup. Bummer. They gave me the world's smallest portion of rice (the egg roll is pretty tiny too-- but good) and a decent portion of the curry. I like that I have left overs but hate that it means making my own rice now. There were a lot of veggies in the sauce which was nice, a lot of places skimp on the veggies, but there could have been more chicken. The flavor was good, not the best I've had, but not terrible. They got the spice level right (though I always end up adding more). Overall, I'll go back and maybe try something different but with that tiny portion of rice, I don't see myself picking up a curry dish again."}
{"text":"The wife and I had dinner here tonight. It was pretty good. We shared the fried  sweet potatoes app and that they were good. Nice and soft on the inside and crispy on the, it was served with a sweet tangy sauce. We then shared the chicken pad Thai. That was good with just a hint of spice. That's how we ordered it.  I would have given them a higher rating if they had a bartender on staff so they could make the drinks that they list on the menu. Overall good place, good prices. I would go back."}
{"text":"Awesome food & service. This place never disappoints!  If you are downtown this is the best option for good quality food for a good price.  Family owned and they really care about customers. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Food is always pretty but the service is usually terrible. I ordered extra eggplant in my eggplant garlic Bijen and 3 pieces of eggplant came. When I asked the waitress about it, she went running and eventually came back and said they ran out of eggplant. Well, to my surprise, the table next to me that came after they told me they were out of eggplant got a dish with eggplant...story they gave me was kind of Garbage. The claim was that they were already cooking the other people's food before they realized they screwed up on my order. Then they charged me for the extra eggplant..."}
{"text":"My favorite spot! Altho please make the raisins come back in the pineapple fried rice"}
{"text":"Delish! Friendly wait staff. Food was very tasty. Warning: A little on the spicy side but very good. Well worth the \"runny nose\" from the spice!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place for a number of reasons. I was genuinely welcomed by who I believe is the owner. A very nice woman. She knew the customers who were eating at the establishment and sat down to catch up with them \"very personable\". I ordered the yellow curry with chicken which came with a spring roll and jasmine rice. The curry had just the right amount of heat and sweet balance. Also ordered a Thai tea which was also perfectly sweetened as I did not leave with a new cavity haha. My server a nice younger gentleman who I'm sorry I don't remember his name was very informative of the menu helped me decide what to order. All in all I would highly recommend Thai basil and will probably be making it my go to Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a little higher if this was the only thai place in Phoenix that i had ever tried, but in comparison it wasn't anything too special. The food was good, don't get me wrong but the portions were small for what you're paying for and nothing was so good it would bring me back. But service was very friendly and parking was easy for being downtown!"}
{"text":"Overpriced Thai food in my opinion and boy do I miss Thaipan. The employees here are friendly however I always walk away feeling like I've paid too much and I never felt this way when Thaipan was previously in operation. The service is swift and the quality of the food is decent. I still favor Siam Thai cuisine as my personal favourite."}
{"text":"I've only had take out from Thai Basil so I can't comment much on the restaurant and overall experience. I can, however comment about how I am hooked on their yellow curry. YUM!! I also love the jasmine rice with it. We've also gotten the pad thai (typical, I know, but it's a good standard) and theirs did not disappoint."}
{"text":"This place is a disappointment.  My last three visits were unpleasant-I've been ignored by the staff, even though the dining room was practically empty.  I've had crappy food-the signature dish is about as good as a microwave meal.  I've had inconsistent curry, one time tasty, the next time a runny mess with no flavor and too spicy even though I expressed my preference.  There are tons of great Thai restaurants in the valley, but this is no longer one of them."}
{"text":"I got the sweet not curry it was really good the soup was amazing. Also my date was quite sweet as well"}
{"text":"I went to that paradise valley location and I'm not sure if all the locations serve PHO but I don't recommend ordering it if you're expecting the real thing. I decided to give it a try bc I was in the area and needed some soup bc of my cough. My best description is that it tastes like flavored water w vegetables. Ps I've never had Vietnamese pho w carrots and zucchini's"}
{"text":"Yeah,  so skip it. I was too generous the first time.  Kitchen doesn't know what Thai spice levels are. Twice now asked for \"hot\" and couldn't taste spice at all. Asked server what to ask for next time and got no suggestion nor apology.  The beef in the drunken noodles was stringy and tough.  Too many better places around."}
{"text":"Horrible service, flat sodas, no one can make specialty drinks on a Friday night Food ok but took forever  I have no idea how there are 4 of these restaurants - have to believe it is some sort of franchise experiment to people who don't know how to run restaurants ...."}
{"text":"Great thai food for the US. We have been to thailand and ofcourse no food can match that quality  but my wife and i were pretty impressed by the quality. Plus it is close to our house. I would recommend"}
{"text":"This place has good food but you just have to be ok with the cooks taking a partial taste and returning the rest to the pot. And be ok with rude wait staff. And be ok with slow server. Pray that the cook does not have any communicable diseases."}
{"text":"This place was good but the shrimp was overcooked in one of our meals and that's not okay.  The dumplings are amazing though!"}
{"text":"I am so happy I found this place. I've been craving good Thai Food and I was happy this location is close to work. I walked in around 11:30am and the restaurant was filled up with hungry folks. I ordered the Pork Peanut Panang and was super happy with the dish. Everything was tasty and their side house soup was very flavorful. I recruited some of my work buddies to come back with me for another Thai lunch!!  You have made my lunch roster!!!"}
{"text":"We love the Thai food here. Small Thai restaurant with great food. We tent to get the same thing every-time, which is egg rolls or pot stickers and chicken curry and rice which we split. This is our absolute go to Thai food. Always good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Overall this place is worth a try. Really small and limited space with about 5-6 tables suitable for a whole of less than 20 people at the same time. The roasted duck salad is refreshing and the duck is crispy. The fried pineapple rice is a little bit different- not served in a pineapple as its bowl but instead, on a plain plate, which to my view, kinda impaired the flavor of the dish. The mango sticky rice can be better if more coconut milk was added. The service is fast, I guess because of the limited space and customers waiting outside. But the downside is that the waitresses came to our table so often just to check if we're still working - it's understandable but a little bit rushing. For this reason, i only give it a four-star."}
{"text":"Not sure if the page is out of date, but I called to place a pick up order 34 min before they're suppose to close. The guy that answered told me \"my kitchen's closed Mann\". I asked what time they closed, he hesitated and responded \"ummm .... like 8:30\" even though they're clearly open until 9.   I've eaten Thai basil before, and the food is good. Low star review because lying is unethical."}
{"text":"I was so surprised by this place.... I hadn't ever even considered coming here because I have been to other Thai basil locations and didn't think it was all that wonderful. So when I found myself let down by the new ramen place next door being closed, I decided to give this place a shot. The food was shockingly good! The husband got the most delish panang curry and I had the spicy noodles, which were ok but not as good as the curry. The prices are a bit high for Thai, but tasty enough to be worth it. He service wasn't wonderful, but it wasn't terrible eithet, just a bit slow. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"First of all the food is good. I gave them a one star because the service is horrible. It is so slow and there are a lot of tables even available. It is not that crazy busy! My food is a little bit spicy so I ask for an ice green tea refill and takes forever!. I just bare the spice feeling on my mouth!.."}
{"text":"Great place and great taste. Must try Drunken Noodles, Red Curry (Spicy) and the Fried Rice"}
{"text":"Great service, large portions, excellent ingredients. Walking distance to many downtown living locations."}
{"text":"Of the 3 Thai places within walking distance of my downtown office, this is clearly the standout. Thai Basil is decorated beautifully, clean, has great service, and the lunch deals are perfect for the working lunch crowd.   I've always been a fan of Thai food, and while there may be better out there - for what i'm looking for in a lunch option, this is the best. Love the yellow curry, great flavor. Also went for a basic fried rice dish one day and that was great too. Recommend this place for a quick lunch for a reasonable price :)"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Thai Basil and were very disappointed with the food. The lunch specials were cheap ($10 or less) but the food was greasy and in some cases tasted off. My green curry was the one dish that was okay, but the spring roll that came with it was very oily and seemed kind of old. The yellow curry was unusually yellow, even for a Thai curry, and we realized that it was because there was so much turmeric in it. The sauce was pretty bitter because of the turmeric. The pad Thai was pretty flavorless and we weren't able to eat the stirfry dishes since they just smelled a little off. Unfortunately we won't be getting food from here again. Keeping this at two stars since one out of the five orders were okay, the price is cheap, and they did actually include napkins and silverware."}
{"text":"I ended up taking my 6 year old here on accident.  The navigation took me to the noodle bar, and I didn't walk an additional 50ft'  and thought the business had changed hands (went to noodle bar on another trip - good).  Both my son and I liked the food - a bit on the greasy side, but had plenty of flavor.  If I went back I think it would have to be with the Mrs. - or for a happy hour visit.  Don't think it would be a repeat with the kiddos - Noodle bar next door is more the kids speed."}
{"text":"I'm kind of worried about this place. First, this is for the new location Downtown. I guess they have another one in Park Central, but I've never seen it. When you call for takeout, they remind you of which location you're calling. I like that because some people are idiots and will probably go to the other one. I loooooooove the curried noodle dish. I've eaten it in the restaurant and ordered it for takeout. The service is super friendly and the place itself is really nice.  Call ahead before going, though. I drove down there one night after checking their hours and they were closed. Who does that????? That's the main reason I'm worried about this place staying open. It gets a good lunch crowd, but they need to work on dinner, too. Prices are reasonable and on par with the 87 other Thai places Downtown."}
{"text":"Had an order come out pretty late but the management made it right by giving the order for free. The pad Thai was pretty decent, includes lots of sprouts."}
{"text":"I will NEVER return to this Thai Basil - what a scam !!  Myself and my dining companion both ordered the same dish.  It was fine - nothing special nothing horrible.  However, once we received the bill we were charged $2.00 more for each dish.  When I politely brought the issue to the manager (I guess - if she is she is HORRIBLE !!) she advised me that they have a small - tiny advisement at the bottom of the menu that prices are subject to change.   Ha ha ha - you have got to be kidding me !!  I advised her that they should be verbally advising their customers when there is a price change.  I advised her that it was unacceptable and her reply was \"It is no big deal\".  She is going to tell me what is and isn't a big deal to our pocketbook - I don't think so !!    She should have eaten the $4.00 because we have not been back and will never go back.  For $4.00 she has lost hundreds of dollars in future business because my dining partner was a regular guest for years at that Thai Basil- NOT a smart move !!"}
{"text":"I really, really, really, like their food.  The spring rolls and Pad Thai are amazing.  I used to get delivery to my house regularly because they are only 1 mile away and delivery was free.  Now though disappointingly, they are not offering delivery though they still have a big sign on their front window that says \"We deliver\" which I think they should remove.  I called on New Year's Eve wanting delivery and when they said they did not have delivery @ the moment I asked if it was because it was New Year's Eve.  They replied, \"No, delivery driver quit.\"  I just ordered from them again last Sunday, but when I called in, apparently they haven't gotten a new one yet because they said they still couldn't deliver.  Yet, when I arrived @ the restaurant to pick up my order, the \"We deliver,\" sign was still up. ????  I have never eaten in at this place.  I've only gotten take out.  I will continue to order from them because it's the best Thai food and closest Thai food nearby.  YuM!!  Would definitely recommend though I obviously miss the handy delivery option.  It was just SO EASY."}
{"text":"I love this place. We try and go every other week. The service is a little slow but the food is great. I have been to several Thai restaurants from NYC to CA and this one is in my top 3 for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here few times and they never disappoint to satisfy my Thai curry cravings.  Their menu is simple. You can order any dish and then choose protein including lamb, tofu, chicken, beef and shrimp. Every dish can be made to order with spice level from 1 to 5. One is very mild, while 5 is Thai spicy and believe me, it pretty spicy.  Lunch entree comes with cup of soup. The entree portions are not too big or small, it's just right. Their ingredients are very fresh and most of dishes comes with generous serving of vegetables.  The service can be little slow, but reasonable during busy lunch hour."}
{"text":"They have new owners now, worst customer service ever. I want to give them 0 stars. Previous owners were so good.  These guys are just horrible!!!!! The food is not even the same anymore."}
{"text":"I've been eating my way through the menu here and so far I've been impressed with the consistency of the food, freshness of ingredients and  general level of service.  Heat levels are hard to come by, Thai hot is not the adventure it is at other eateries but at least there is something there.    Lunch portion wise it's almost  not enough, in relation to the two I used to frequent in Scottsdale it's not that it's tiny just seems off for the area."}
{"text":"Fabulous !  Dropped for lunch on a whim and had the best pork larb salad ever.  Nice ambiance and very friendly service.  Only drawback is its location is not obvious at PV Mall (between Sears and Macy's). We will definitely be regular in future."}
{"text":"I love the downtown location. It's not like there are a lot of sit down Asian/Thai places in the area. It's just as hard to find parking of course as any other place in Downtown Phoenix, but well worth it. The food is great and they have a very expansive menu! I love the simple stuff like Thai Basil with Chicken or fried rice. Ingredients taste fresh and have unique flavor. The service is good and there is indoor seating. They deliver sometimes, but if they are super busy, you may have to go pick it up. They serve a lot of dishes with Jasmine rice and theirs is perfectly made!  They have desserts and the ice creams are UH-mazing! Green tea and coconut?? Oh ma gosh. This location can be nice even for a casual date or lunch meeting. Can't wait to go there and try something else!"}
{"text":"I made a yelp account because I feel obligated to tell you all that this is hands down the worst Thai food I have ever experienced in my life. I ordered the Siamese fried rice and it was a 0/10. I ordered spicy level medium and honestly I don't even think they put salt on it. At one point I was confused whether I was eating an omelet or rice or canned pineapple with wet carrots. Was it rice or was it couscous, the world will never know. No flavor. No love. No returning from me."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Happened in on accident since Z Pizza was closed on the night of the Janet Jackson concert...their loss and our gain. Stop by and try them soon"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix & got lucky because this is the BEST Thai food I've had since I visited Thailand several years ago (I try Thai restaurants in every city I visit)!  I am so glad I stumbled upon this place.  Authentic Thai taste, you won't be disappointed.  I had red curry, mango sticky rice, and jasmine tea.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Food quality was fair for the price. Though the meso soup was a bit old, and the napkins had a sour smell to them. A new waitress took our order and had no idea what she was doing and couldn't answer any of our questions, she even told us she was new and was sorry for any confusion. Tempura oil temperature was too low to cook properly and left the food oily. May not be returning."}
{"text":"A rare instance where popularity and quality actually correlate. I have tried several other Thai shops in the area and this is by far the best downtown has to offer. It's a little pricier than the other shops, though, which is the ding. I've noticed at other shops that the spiciness can be kind of inconsistent (medium may feel like hot one day and mild another), but they are pretty good about that here. If you are down town and want to try a good eat, meh pricing, and are not going between 11am and 1pm? This is the spot for you!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant about trying this place for a while. I work nearby, so it was a nice quick pick up. I ordered the pad Thai and a Thai tea which were both delicious. I love Thai food and it's nice to have a place so close to work and home that help satisfy the craving.   My only complaint is about the staff. At times, I've walked by and gotten \"cat-called\" by men that I noticed work there. Really set me off and I haven't been back for a while, simply because of that. If I do ever order, it's pick up only."}
{"text":"Outstanding service seated, fed and out the door in 32 minutes. They really impressed me! I got the pad broccoli, so good! I'd highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Sunday night and this place was fairly (and expectedly) slow.  Seated immediately and friendly.  The only mark-down for this entire experience was the water-- it had a tiny fly in it, and an unidentifiable piece of something (maybe fruit pith?).  I'm not a big water drinker, so I ordered a beer. :)  Ordered the red Thai curry with lamb.  Ordered it \"Thai spicy,\" but I've had hotter.  Still, delicious!  The coconut curry sauce was excellent--on par with a delicious bisque.   Price was nice. Just under $20 for dinner and drinks.  I'll come back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I think the waiters there already know my order. The food is good I like the atmosphere there. I get the cashew with beef! Try it next time you're there."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite Thai Food in the valley. I have been to the Chandler and Tempe locations and now the Scottsdale location. The Green Curry with Shrimp is my favorite dish. Have tried a few other dishes which were amazing as well, but the green curry keeps me coming back. I highly recommend Thai Basil."}
{"text":"BEST customer service out of all Thai Restaurants in the downtown area. The food gets a 10 as well!  Make sure to stop by during lunch, the menu has everything!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! Great service!!! I would recommend the green curry, its so delicious!"}
{"text":"I haven't had khao soi in a while and although Thai Basil's version is not the best I've ever had, it was solid and I was glad to find it on the lunch specials.  I went to Thai Basil with a few coworkers during training and we had a very limited lunch hour. Thai Basil was a fast option that satisfied the entire party."}
{"text":"From the previous reviews I was expecting alot from this restaurant.   Honestly wanted to like this place but did not live up to expectations.   Ordered the Coconut Shrimp,  Drunken Noodles,  Chicken Curry and Thai Basil Fried Rice.  The Coconut Shrimp was pretty good, the Drunken Noodles were good but did not leave an impression. The Chicken Curry was tasty. We ordered the yellow curry but the base was a little on the watery thin side. I prefer it to be a little bit more thick. The fried rice was just average.   The service was good and fast.  As we finished,  they brought take out containers and as I poured the curry base into the plastic container there was a hole in the bottom and began to leak out. Half of the liquid base poured down the table onto the floor.  One of the workers was real concerned and the other asked how was the food.  Was not overall taken by this place and not to certain to return."}
{"text":"Location: Lots of tables available for seatings. Overall the restaurant is relatively clean.   Service: Waiters and waitresses are great. They are attentive, friendly and my food came out in 10 minutes. Their speedy service really helps when I was on time crunch during a lunch break.   Food: I ordered a drunken noodles and it was delicious. The spicy level is exactly to my liking and the Thai ice tea is in a tall glass with reasonable amount of ice.   Rating: I'll definitely come back here again. Price is reasonable and love their speedy service."}
{"text":"It is nice to have other options at the mall for food and the food was good enough. I ordered the basil chicken. The rice was overcooked or maybe just not a good brand of rice. The chicken was pretty hard, not tender at all. The sauce was a bit over powering and I like flavor! The service was okay, the girl was nice. The bathrooms were really gross. I never write about bathrooms on my reviews but these seemed like they hadn't had a deep clean in months or even since opening. Grime on the toilets and floor edges with papers and trash pieces on the floor and counters. That makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Hard to say this is Thai food. Yes there is a nod to the flavors but the food is simply too watered down to be meaningful.  Service was curt and the place dirty.  Red curry was basically soup. Eating partner got food poisoning. I did not so my 2 stars is completely independent to their experience."}
