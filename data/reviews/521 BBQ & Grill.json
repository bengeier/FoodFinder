{"text":"Wonderful! One of my favorite places. BBQ is expertly cooked and service is always prompt. The price is right."}
{"text":"Coming to NC for the first time, I had to try some bbq.  I've been \"smokin\" for over 15 years and believe I have a pretty good handle on what makes good bbq. 521 is very good.  A little different than I'm used to because the bbq is less smokey and a bit more on the sweeter side.  The ribs are absolutely fall off the bone good.  I can't even begin to imagine what other yelpers wrote about their ribs being tough...huh!?  Their bbq (pulled pork) was very tasty too but lacked a little flavor.  After mixing both table sauces together and putting it on the bbq, it was fantastic.  We were there on a Fri so they had bbq chicken, which was also very good. I also don't understand some comments on their french fries.  They're the same frozen fries that many restaurants use.  Nothing special but certainly not bad...they were perfectly ordinary fries. Service was above good and I totally recommend this place."}
{"text":"this is good barbeque in a strip mall setting... the best available in south charlotte.  stay away from the ribs... they are not that tender.  the place normally does not show up on the charlotte radar since it is farther down 521... just past sun city.  it is worth the trip for the authentic barbeque as well as the ambiance (aka south carolina strip mall barbeque)."}
{"text":"Solid local place to get BBQ in the fort mill area. There are much better places but this being the closest to me is a good place.  Usually get the pulled pork and am always satisfied. Hush Puppies are amazing.  The combo plates are loaded and you'll never leave hungry."}
{"text":"I'd say this place is average.  We went in on a rainy Thursday and it was pretty light traffic, no wait. We were seated promptly and ordered some fried pickles which were pretty good. Thinly sliced, battered and fried just right.  I ordered the ribs, full place with fries, coleslaw and hush puppies. My wife ordered a fried chicken sandwich that I can't speak to.  The ribs were meaty and not overcooked. The ribs had some chew, as in you had to pull some of the meat off the bone as compared to a sloppy mess. The downfall to them was the fact that they weren't warm, and the sauce they slathered it with was high on the sugar content.   I think I'd go back for a meal to try something else, don't expect a 5 star meal is all."}
{"text":"I usually have pulled pork, which is always first rate and is served without sauce.  They have an outstanding grilled chicken sandwich and the hush puppies are the best I've had.  There are two sauces on the table and a refrigerated mustard sauce available on request."}
{"text":"Never again! The only good thing here is their ranch dressing. After waiting almost 15 minutes for drinks and another 30 for our food they came out to let us know my husband's side was out & we should have been told when we ordered. Well, if the cook knew they were out, a restaurant with decent customer service would have let us know shortly after placing the order & not 30 minutes later when serving. Bottom line, we won't be back. Would have given half a star but I just came from church."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Generous portions.  You will not be disappointed. Try the hush puppies too!"}
{"text":"Had pulled pork, green beans, mac n' cheese and all were excellent!  Would definitely recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The hush puppies are amazing and their bbq plate is the perfect size. What's even better is how quickly they serve you so it's a great place to go for lunch during the work week."}
{"text":"Love this BBQ & Ribs restaurant. Service is awesome. Portions are huge. My wife & I always share a tray of ribs & bbq. Kids menu includes ice cream. In my opinion best ribs ever had"}
{"text":"Seriously some of the best bbq in the area.  Everytime my family comes fine from Indiana, we have to order food from here.  I live about 20 minutes away, but it's worth the drive to me."}
{"text":"We have loved the food of 521 for several years, and now the location is just as awesome! My husband and I ate there recently for lunch on a Friday, and it was so crowded we had to eat at the bar! That says a lot for how much others love the food, too! Can't wait to go back! Recommend."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ, ribs, hush puppies, and chicken wings. Excellent all around! They are my go to for BBQ"}
{"text":"Had the barbecued brisket sandwich. They bring complimentary hush puppies to the table. Everything tasted good. Reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The good-our waitress was great and the fries and hushpuppies were awesome! The okay-tea was sweet and the food got there fast The bad-silverskin not taken off the ribs, pork chop was way overdone and dry The awful-baked beans had a weird aftertaste, kinda like garlic powder maybe; and the cole slaw was the consistency of mashed potatoes. I ordered the combo of ribs and pork chop. My wife got the pulled pork small sandwich. First thing I noticed when I got the ribs was the silverskin. It is tough and should always be removed. I asked the waitress about this and she had no idea but said that was the way they cook the ribs. I pulled it off and the rest was just okay. My wife did like the fact that they had Frank's Red Hot sauce and bbq sauce at the table and says her sandwich was okay as well. Even though this place is on the way home from work I do not think we will be going back."}
{"text":"The staff was nice and attentive. I got the chopped pork sandwich, which had a decent smoke ring -- could have used more in my opinion.  The meat had a nice balance of fat.  Just wish it had more smoke flavor. Tried the 3 sauces at the table but kept going back to the Piedmont or Lexington NC style. The SC style was my least favorite and came off as a barely dressed-up mustard (bummer, I tend to prefer an awesome SC style).  I got the white slaw on the side and it was meh. I'll try the red slaw next time -- yes, there will definitely be a next time!  Hush puppies came for the table and I'm so glad they did. These were hot and delicious!   Hoping to get a smokier sampling next time and the coleslaw could be tweaked, but who the hell seeks meat and would call it off for some cabbage?  Just a nice addition when it's don't right."}
{"text":"3nd time I have been there and all times have had membrane still on the ribs(still can't figure out why I went the second and third time) .also no thought or money spent in dinning \"ambiance\"...go somewhere else"}
{"text":"This place is a winner. BBQ was excellent. Be sure to try the mustard based sauce. It was just right with not too much mustard taste and a hint of sweetness. Their regular BBQ sauce is also great.  The hush puppies were perfect with a crunchy outside and soft inside. The beans, onion rings and fries were great.  We were impressed with the portion size and needed a take out box.  Service was good. The wait staff attentive and food brought out quickly. The atmosphere was relaxed with a couple of large screen TVs and music playing in the background. It was not loud and you could talk normally to the waitress or anyone at your table.  We will be going back."}
{"text":"Huge fan of the restaurant.  We just moved to the area from Kansas City and we're worried we would not find a bbq joint we would enjoy.   Big fan of their ribs and bbq.  Hush puppies and sweat bbq sauce are great.   Portions a huge but always enjoy the leftovers.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Slow service, Bar-B-Q was dry. Waitress never checked on us after dropping our orders off. My drink was empty for over half my meal. Was looking forward to this place but am very disappointed."}
{"text":"We stopped by today for a quick lunch while out house hunting with our Realtor. The server took the drink orders and then brought hush puppies. Unfortunately, they were cold & obviously had been sitting for a while. We ordered our lunch entrees 2 BBQ pork plates and one rib plate. My pork plate had a huge fatty chunk of meat that was not edible. When the server came back to refill our drinks, our Realtor told her about my pork. She immediately took my plate back and quickly brought me a new one with better pork. She apologized that the plate came out that way, indicating they had new cooks in the back.  We have been to 521 numerous times before and this time was the worst."}
{"text":"OOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!!! Best barbecue I have had apart from a specific food truck in Nashville!!"}
{"text":"Wow, für Freunde des echten, amerikanischen BBQ ein echtes Highlight; und ich bin kein Freund von Fast Food  was BBQ in der hier dargereichten Form auch nicht ist. Wir waren auf Empfehlung eines Freundes hier. Wer es nicht kennt, würde wahrschienlich dran vorbeifahren: es ist in einem kleinem Business Komplex mit Parkplätzen direkt vor der Tür an einem Highway gelegen (wobei mancher Highway auch nur zweispurig  also wie eine Bundesstraße ist). Es geht hier sehr sauber, schnell, freundlich und unprätentiös zu: Plastikteller,  besteck und Becher. Man kann sehr schön draußen sitzen. Qype konnte den Platz unter Fort Mill bzw. Indian Land nicht finden  aber unter Charlotte. Deshalb habe ich die Fahne auf der Karte an den richtigen Ort gesetzt. Was gibts hier? Ribs und BBQ Fleisch, welches ca. 14 Stunden im Smoker/Grill und im Slow Cooker gegart wurde. Das Fleisch fällt quasi auseinander bzw. von den Ribs, so zart ist es. Dazu auch ziemlich fettfrei. Wer das nicht mag kann auch formidable Burger bestellen oder auch was vom Huhn. Achtung: am besten früh zum Lunch kommen (so ab 11:30h) denn dann fallen Horden von Gästen ein. Toiletten sehr sauber, Preise im Mittelfeld. Ein absolutes Highlight im Bereich BBQ."}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff. Manager did not care  dirty  bathroom"}
{"text":"We love 521... we eat there every week... recently they changed their mac and cheese recipe and it used to be the best around but now it tastes like velveeta (cheap tasteless supermarket product) not sure why they did this. They also run out of food so call ahead if your craving something... other than the above they have the best BBQ around..."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. The first time I had a barbeque sandwhich drink and fries for under or around $10. The second time I had a rib plate. The rib plate was excellent. The hush puppies are awesome. I do wish they gave you more than 3. It's a tough decision which is better this place or Jim and Nicks. The ribs at 521 are hands down the best. The rib meat is extremely tender. I will say that the baked beans or nothing special. The barbeque sandwhich was good too. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre, and the staff is extremely unprofessional. They have an open kitchen, and the content of the staffs conversation was awful. This place is not family friendly; I do not recommend bringing kids there. I ordered food to go, and it took 25 minutes; which I felt was long; especially when all you hear is the staffs unpleasant conversation."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since they first opened their Indian Land restaurant probably 7-8 years ago.  The ribs are not what they used to be.  Small ribs no longer cut individually with sauce basted ... Sloppy presentation with the rack just cut in half and a few squirts of their famous sauce.  This use to be the best BBQ place I had ever eaten at.  Such a disappointment.  Hopefully someone will step up and bring it back to how it was."}
{"text":"Best ribs by far in the area!  Pulled pork is also very good. Several times we've gotten a tub of pulled pork to go, put it in the crock & serve. Always a crowd favorite. Green beans are a great side choice. Must have fried pickles for an appetizer!  Great for families too"}
{"text":"Great ribs!!! great local beers!!!I would give 5 stars for just that!....all good except bathroom facilities are small, had to wait too long for people in front of us."}
{"text":"Awesome place, moving to a new location near the Harris Teeter. Huge portions and great food. My favorite Ribs in the area!"}
{"text":"Love 521! I relocated from the Northeast 2 years ago and this is where I bring all my out of town guests to experience the best bbq. The ribs are absolute the best I've had in the area, and what I always order. The pulled pork is also good, but does not stand up to the ribs in my opinion. I love that this is a very unassuming restaurant, that really just focuses on the quality of their food. One thing to note is this location does not serve beer or wine, but really you should just be coming for the ribs anyway. Recommend this to everyone in the Charlotte area looking for the best bbq!"}
{"text":"521 is hands down the best BBQ in the Charlotte area. We've tried Spoons, Bubba's, Mac's, etc etc. They have the best. The pulled pork is smoked for 14 hours, ribs are great and they serve the best BBQ chicken you can find anywhere (only on Fridays.) Don't miss the hushpuppies...the best I've ever had.   If you stop for lunch, get there early. The line wraps around the building."}
{"text":"LOVE!! The BBQ pork.  We just moved to Indian Land and for the first 4 months we were here, we probably ate their once a week.  We have nicknamed their hushpuppies \"crackpuppies\".  They are the best we have ever had.  I am not sold on their sauce, sorry but my husband really enjoys it."}
{"text":"521 BBQ & Grill is a solid BBQ joint.  Everything they offer on their menu is as it should be. The Q, the hushpuppies, the slaw...all what you'd expect.  Why only 3 stars? Because it's A-OK...that's why. The atmosphere caters to those of us that want to grab some barbecue for lunch...or sit down for a dineresque family meal. Nothing special...just a cleaner...more milk-toast version of a gritty barbecue joint.   Our service was great and the prices were as you'd expect. If you have a hankerin for some barbecue...stop in and grab some. You won't be disappointed.   Try: The barbecue...it's what barbecue tastes like  Avoid: Bringing your foodie-fusion expectations"}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Friendly bartender who made sure I was taken care of.  Glad they relocated from the below grade shopping center to the Harris Teeter center up the street. You always get more food than you possibly could eat!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the Queen City.  Staff is friendly and it has a great down home Feel.  A must trip down south if Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"521 has been around for several years, and now that the area around it is more developed, they've added a nice outdoor patio. I love 521 BBQ's pulled pork. It has a mildly smoky flavor, and you get the brown crusty parts of the pork too.   The ambiance at 521 isn't much to write home about, but I love to drop in to pick up a couple of pounds of pulled pork to go. It's about $10/lb hot, but if you're willing to take it home and reheat it, they'll sell you the remnants of yesterday's pork, already refrigerated, for about $6 which is a much better deal. I pick up that, a thing of their vinegar based sauce, and I'm good for a week! Love the stuff. It's not the absolute best I've ever eaten, but it's pretty high up there!"}
{"text":"Found this place by accident. Best BBQ in this local area IMO. I eat here once a week. They have awesome, reasonable prices. Their food is delicious!! I tend to stay towards the pork BBQ, pork BBQ ribs, hush puppies, and fries."}
{"text":"1st time at the new location. Everything was excellent. The new location is a little too nice. I kind of prefer the picnic table with the red check table cloth look of the original location but the ribs were as good as ever. Also looks like they have a pretty good local beer selection. I was getting takeout so I couldn't tae advantage. I would go back just for the hushpuppies."}
{"text":"PSST! Hey, wanna know where the best barbeque in the Queen City is? Come closer, let me whisper it in your ear.  It ain't in Charlotte.  Nope. It's in Indian Land.   At the appropriately named 521 BBQ and Grill, because it's on - wait for it - Rte. 521 (or Old Charlotte Hwy, once you cross into South Carolina), you're going to be treated to some of the finest barbeque and ribs you've ever sampled. Now, listen up, because this means something: I am not a big fan of barbeque, and, yes, I've sampled some of the more well-known barbeque establishments in town. I like 'em, but, honestly, I can't say any of them make me want to fall in love with barbeque the way every Southerner is required by Southern law to love barbeque. I'm a Yankee, so I've got that going against me.  But 521's barbeque and ribs is different. I can't explain it. Again, I'm a Yankee. My point of reference is Tony Roma's. Yeah. I don't know what kind of secret sauce they put on their barbeque and ribs, but whatever it is, it makes me crave the living hell out of their food almost weekly. I will likely die of a heart attack because of 521 BBQ and Grill.  Damn you. Why did you have to taste so good?"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, big portions, be ready to take some home!! All that and a cold draft..I will be back!"}
{"text":"Decent ribs I'm not a huge fan of there sauce personally but the hush puppies are good.. I'd give it a 3 star"}
{"text":"Carrie was our waiter and she was great. Meat was very tasty a little on the dry side but tasty none the less. Had a rib n pork platter someone else had Mac n cheese. Ribs were tasty and their house BBQ sauce was VERY yummy. There may be better BBQ places but this place was still delicious none the less."}
{"text":"HOW DARE THIS PLACE EVEN EXCIST IN THE SOUTH AND SERVE ITS CUSTOMERS BOX MACARONI AND CHEESE!!??? AS MUCH AS YOU CHARGE FOR FOOD THIS IS HOW YOU APPRECIATE YOUR CUSTOMERS??? From the horrible taste of it it's not even Kraft or Valveeta but maybe some no name off brand!   I like the wings and ribs at 521, But I won't ever come back to this place unless I hear this pitiful dish is replaced. I like restaurants with standards that won't take the easy way out. If your customers grossly overpay for food, the quality of your food should display your gratitude for their patronage!!  DO BETTER!"}
{"text":"Update: Ate here a few weeks ago and it was awesome!  I've eaten here four times, and 3 of those visits were great. Tonight, however, my experience was less than desirable. My dinner date and I chose to eat outside. First off, our waitress rarely came out and checked on us. She even told us she always forgets about her tables on the patio. Next, upon being seated at the patio we noticed there was an empty picnic table full of dirty dishes. When we left about an hour later, that table still hadn't been cleaned off. It was kind of gross to have to look at. Additionally, and perhaps the worst thing, was the food. I ordered the wing tray and my wings were dry as the Sahara, almost like they had been sitting out under a heat lamp. I've ordered them several times before, and they had always been good up until today. One of my hush puppies was so hard I literally thought I'd break a tooth on it. Overall, tonight's food was just unsatisfying. I feel like I wasted my money. I really hope they get it together, because usually this place is great, but tonight everything was disappointing."}
{"text":"Ribs, ribs, fall of the bone ribs!!! You can't go wrong with ribs and pulled pork. Service staff is very friendly..."}
{"text":"Th ribs are excellent and the wait staff are as friendly as can be. This is the type of place you can take the whole family to and not worry about spending too much to feed them all."}
{"text":"The biggest & possibly the best hushpuppies ever. I like a place where even the sides are unexpectedly awesome.  The ribs were silly huge, meaty, fall-apart tender. Liked the different BBQ sauces on the table. Very busy at lunch, but the servers were friendly & kept their cool. Well worth the drive into SC."}
{"text":"One word. YUM!!! I keep going back to the BBQ sandwich with the White Slaw and a side of Potato Salad!! It's amazing!! The buns they use are delicious too! Their Sweet Tea is great, and words cannot describe how wonderful the Banana Pudding is!! Seating is a bit limited and it does get loud. Best to go early or late!!"}
{"text":"best food ever . Good food is good enough for me. I crave this food everyday.I DONT CARE WHAT THE BAD YELPER DAVID V. or Malachi M. SAY nor should anyone. Good God David what does anyone have to do for you to shut your trap of poisonous words.David do you wan a side of kiss ass with your meal? Reading your review make me want to puke as to the depth of your thoughts and thinking as a human being. If you say they dont know how to run to restaurant to you liking then help them instead of going on yelp and write this stupid review. david you are what the world do not need right now. If Hitler wan a son you would be a perfect candidate. telling other people to hate because you are a hater.  If i was the owner of this restaurant. I would puke on you rather get a five star from you. have a soul David. If you have a good soul you wouldnt be on yelp writing these stupid reviews."}
{"text":"Ribs were excellent, but the collard greens were not done enough or seasoned enough, the cheese  fries were soggy with canned cheese sauce, and Fox News was on one of the largest TVs. The hush puppies were delicious and those who ordered the string beans and fried okra said they were very good. The place still needs work, but I would order the ribs to go next time and make my own sides. Good effort. Still needs work."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've had in the area at the best price. I always get the pulled pork BBQ sandwich with the cole slaw on the side. Their carolina BBQ sauce is excellent. Their sides are really good as well - the green beans are THE BEST I've had anywhere. Super amazing. What I really love is when you dine in, you are soon greeted by warm hush puppies - awesome. The staff is always super sweet and courteous. Very good people. The ambiance has a local pub feel. Cozy but not as cozy as a Jim & Nick's.   What would I change? Not much. I would love to see them have mashed potatoes and gravy with biscuits, but that's just a selfish ask. The beef brisket is pretty much the only thing I've tasted that I don't really like. Fort Mill BBQ wears the crown on that one (but that's the only thing that would make me go there - and it's kinda expensive there).  Overall really great value - great food, great service, great price. I've committed to myself to eat their special listed on the tables - the meal for two...but on my birthday...just for me ;)."}
{"text":"Fantastic place! Excellent BBQ. Try the ribs, you'll go back for more! Great people and a fun, casual atmosphere. Give it a shot the next time you have a craving for BBQ, you can't really go wrong anywhere on the menu. Oh yeah, the smoked buffalo wings are phenomenal. A whole new take on buffalo wings that just might make you rethink the wings you have been eating all along!"}
{"text":"Tried this place out and was a bit disappointed.   I had the pulled pork sandwich.  It was dry, even after adding sauces.  I could have just caught them on a bad day, but still.  Also, I have never seen a BBQ place that does not have brisket on the menu.  On the positive side, the hush puppies and mac n cheese were great.  On the odd side, my daughter's kids meal was a larger portion than my Large pulled pork sandwich meal."}
{"text":"Besides having amazing food, Cari was so great to work with to cater our wedding reception with 521 BBQ. I had caterers and restaurants not know their own pricing, leave me on hold for way too long, not return calls or emails, etc., so I just wanted to say what a pleasure it was to work with them! And don't forget the food is great too!"}
{"text":"Yummy! The \"BBQ\" (aka pulled pork) is super delicious here, as are the sides. I had the potato salad and baked beans with my pork and the potato salad was a big time winner for me.   Sadly the fire alarm went off in the middle of our meal, but after we were allowed back inside our waitress gave us some complimentary BBQ to take home with us, which was very nice of her.   Can't wait to come back.   HEADS UP - they're closed on Mondays, I've made that mistake twice (although tip to the owners.. if you were open on Mondays you would have received our biz twice. :) )"}
{"text":"I am saddened to say that 521 BBQ, has been a disappointment if late. I was a huge fan, goi g 2 to 3 times per week when they were at the old location and since the move across the street it does not taste the same. I still went but it has just gotten worse. The ribs just do not taste grilled. The last 2 times I know for a fact they were not put back on the grille before we got it. Just so sad, it is going down hill. I will be looking for a new place."}
{"text":"BBQ here is better than average for this area, but by no means fabulous.  (You can get fabulous BBQ in Salisbury and Lexington, NC). Thank goodness they give you a choice of red or white slaw. (Get the red.) Other area BBQ restaurants will give you one or two complimentary hush puppies with a BBQ sandwich order. Not so, here. Too bad, and not very hospitable. Also, a BBQ tray here costs almost twice as much as it does in the better NC BBQ restaurants. Very happy they have moved to a different location with better parking, and an alcohol license. Inside of restaurant could use a bit of help regarding traffic flow. It's awkward for customers as well as wait staff."}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could.  Kevin thought it was a 3 and I would probably give it a 3.5-4.  Five of us arrived here close to 2 on a Saturday, and the place was packed.  We all happened to order the same thing - pulled pork sandwich with a side.  I actually liked the pork with their tomato based sauce.  Kevin just thought it was okay.  It's hard to give these places anything more than just okay when you have had Midwood Smokehouse bbq.  The fries were just okay, but I liked the creamy and cheesy macaroni and cheese!  I would go back for proximity and ease of getting some bbq, but there are definitely better bbq places out there."}
{"text":"Service was fast and staff was friendly.  Food was above average but not the best bbq in the Charlotte area.  I'm a bbq snob so I'm hard to impress. I'll definitely go back to this location."}
{"text":"The food was great but the seating inside is a little cramped and uncomfortable. They don't have the tables spaced out far enough and I could hear everything the people a foot away were saying. Not a huge deal but the BBQ was good."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ amazing hush puppies! Stopped for lunch with the kids...burger was dry and not medium which we ordered. Fries are good but nothing special...the Cue on the other hand is very good. Had the BBQ tray ...a large portion of pulled pork that was moist and tender, they have 2 sauces to choose from and both are very good with a light smoke to it. Beans, slaw and hush puppies all included...more than enough for 2 people...Def worth a try I'll be back to try the some more."}
{"text":"Love this place! My go to place for BBQ in SE Charlotte area. Top on the menu is smoked wings- fantastic flavor.  Ribs- really good and hearty. Rib eye steak sandwich- great flavor with Rib eye on a nice bun. BBQ sauce is fantastic!  Service is good. Depending on the time there may be a wait. Worth the drive if you're not too close!"}
{"text":"Awww yeah! Cant stop cause ya dont stop! Brandon turned me on to this joint a few summers ago and they are STILL bringing it BIG TIME in Indian Land! Other than Maurice's, I will not eat BBQ other than HERE! My wife is French and she even loved it. Good work, Y'all!"}
{"text":"Ok here's my skinny... RIBS are killer! 5 star Worth ordering and picking up anytime... The place is cute and clean. The waitress was actually very attentive and sweet. That's the Good. Now the flip side of the coin. Everything else pretty much SUXS All sides are low end frozen bar food type. Cheeseburger is a Zero Chicken was fair. Our basic meal took 45 minutes to hit our table...pretty lame for a semi fast food spot. One thing that made the experience a Joke  was the fact that the staff does not seem to get (or doesn't CARE) that everything they say the customers can Hear. The cooks we blabbing and letting all of us know what \"SUCKS\" sorta lame when kids are there. The real classic was the heavy weight waitress (CHEYENE) she was complaining about everything. What a mouth on her, if this was my place she would be Fired instantly! They were OUT of ribs just after we ordered. Anyway order the RIBS to go and your fine. Anything else don't waste your time."}
{"text":"We decided to share the 2 meat platter with ribs and pork, which comes with fries, slaw, beans and hush puppies. Wow, so much food, we even brought a small box home! The ribs were super tender! Make sure and ask for the mustard bbq sauce! The hush puppies were some of  my favorite ever! And make sure and get the white slaw! Service was good, even on a busy Friday night! The hostess (looks maybe to be a mgr/owner) should go home,  just gets in the way and hinders the help. Young, fresh staff can handle it!"}
{"text":"I'm a big guy and I love my BBQ. This place is great and you will enjoy your experience with food there. The ribs were so delicious I have bud it the best place to get ribs     We have been three times over 2 months and each time the food was spot on. The customer service is excellent and I tend to be the guy who wants to sub items and swap. My wife also raves about the food and service."}
{"text":"VINEGAR BBQ SAUCE. Love a place the has vinegar now sauce. Theirs is great and spiced just right. Mustard and ketchup based bbq sauce available too. The brisket is great and the pulled pork is good too."}
{"text":"Good but nothing spectacular.  Will come back but won't go out of way for it. Wings were good,  great portion on the wing plate. Mayo based potato salad could use some seasoning,  salt & pepper?  Ribs good but the pork chops were the best thing!  Waitress says grilled food takes 20min but seemed like 5-7min"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in Charlotte and 521 BBQ & Grill is the best barbecue I've tasted outside of Lexington or Wilson, NC. Though I no longer reside in NC, whenever I make a trip down 85 or 77 I almost always take a detour to 521 BBQ. This is how BBQ is meant to be served; nothing fancy, just plain good BBQ with friendly people and a simple atmosphere. I'm not a huge fan of sauce (or dip for those from eastern NC), and the 'cue here speaks for itself; perfectly smoked and seasoned. If you live in the Charlotte area and want the best BBQ without driving to Lexington, stop in at 521."}
{"text":"For BBQ, this is the real deal!  Unbelievable butt and brisket, fantastic sides (beans, slaw and potato salad).  Great sauce and tea.  Belongs in the company of the elite BBQ joints across the U.S."}
{"text":"I hear 521 has new ownership. If so may I offer a few suggestions. 1. \"Thank you for coming in\" would be a nice gesture.  2. The Sunday bartender needs a little update in her training. DO NOT ever put the nozzle of the beer tap into the beer in the glass. 3. $2 upcharge for onion rings is a bit silly. I was charged the $2 and got 5 rings. Guess what! You aren't going to make your overhead on rings. Be a little more generous.  I would be surprised if I hear back from anyone in management. Too bad cause 521 was once one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the Best BBQ in Fort Mill, The ribs are finger licking good and fall off the bone tender! Absolutely Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the area. The ribs, pulled pork, and brisket are really great choices. You can not go wrong with either of there. The baked beans and Mac and cheese are excellent and make the excellent. I have never been disappointed when we eat here"}
{"text":"So very delicious. Came here with a party of 5 that included 3 children. Staff were very welcoming and friendly. Adults both had the BBQ plate. Pulled pork was flavorful and tender. Hush puppies very good. Baked beans were divine. White coleslaw was ok. Kids had grilled cheese and fries, both were tasty. Wish we had room for dessert. We will be back!"}
{"text":"After a half day of non stop eating, stopped for lunch at 521 BBQ, a second location of the flagship eatery located in a shopping mall. Nice outside seating, busy servers, and a good menu, where adults can thankfully order off the kid's menu. Ordered kid - sized rib plate, which consisted of 4 meaty,  well sauced and nicely charred ribs, smoked over hardwood pellets over a gas flame for 12 hours. They were tasty, although I really felt like there was not enough smokiness for my taste. Best hush puppies I have had out of the 3 bbq joints in NC we have visited thus far. Crispy on the outside without any trace of grease, and a perfect balance of moist and flaky inside. The beans were underwhelming,  tasted saucy, as my daughter assesed \"they would be good on a hot dog.\" They had a unique red coleslaw, which our waitress explained was made with a ketchup vinegar base, which wasn't bad, but not anything I would go out of the way to have again. But oh, those hush puppies...they just might!"}
{"text":"Great bbq.  We stopped by  after seeing the museum of the alphabet as we were heading over to the highway to continue our travels.  So glad that we did."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have had in the Charlotte area.   Family atmosphere and very generous portions. I ordered the ribs tray and wife ordered the large bbq sandwich. The ribs were fall off the bone good. Compared to the ribs, sandwich was ok. Hushpuppies were awesome!!  Tip: Try their house sauce on their tables. There's one with chili flakes in them - not too spicy as you'd think. Use abundantly; trust me, you'll love this sauce!  BTW, they should improve on their fries. Only average food item on the whole table."}
{"text":"This place never dissapoints.  Great pulled-pork, delicious even without sauce.  Nice friendly staff, which says alot because this place seems to alway be busy. The one negative thing I can say is that it seems to take forever to get your food, but to be fair, they are awlays busy.   I don't dare complain,  because I'm afraid I'll be banned.    The Charlotte-region is really not know for it's BBQ, or at least quality BBQ, but this place is the exception.  Unlike some of the others, I think think the paper plates, plastic utensils and picnic tables add to it's charm.  Once while I was waiting on a to-go order, the owner came out from behind the counter and offered a few of us a sample of their ribs.  Amazing.  Highly recommend this place, good people and good food."}
{"text":"Having a hard time lately with liking what I'm getting. Wife had the grilled bbq chicken breast on our last take out order, she felt she could do better with a foreman grill and some Wal-Mart bbq sauce. Dry chicken, she ended up eating a frozen pizza. My wings were just not as good as they used to be, they too were dried out, not juicy and had almost no sauce. Had a order of bbq, it got me through the night, it was still decent. Service is always great, but seems quality is sliding."}
{"text":"Probably the best BBQ in the Charlotte area. Darn good ribs too with lots of meat. The meats take center stage here. They don't have much in terms of sides. Just the regulars:slaw, fries,beans.   The hush puppies are worth the trip just by themselves. An order consists of 4 golf-ball size puppies. Nice and crisp on the outside and cooked just right on the inside.   Gets crowded at lunch time and can be a little chaotic inside with waitresses scurrying about and people waiting for a table. But they do have a nice outdoor eating area."}
{"text":"The BBQ and ribs are amazing!  The hush puppies are unbelievable!  However I would skip the french fries, the baked beans are nothing to write home about, and the chicken breast was mediocre.  I've heard good things about the rib-eye sandwich but haven't tried it.  My recommendation for a meal: large BBQ sandwich with white slaw and a side of hush puppies.  Yum!  Tips:  You can order a BBQ sandwich without a bun - basicly a cup of BBQ You can order cooked ribs by the lb"}
{"text":"If you work in the Ballantyne area or happen to be in the Indian Land area, this barbeque place is worth the visit.  Ate here a few times with co-workers, always worth the trip.  I have tried both the pork plate and pork sandwich, they give ample amount of pork with sauces you can choice to put on top.  The fries and hush puppies are very good too.  The location isn't fancy or nothing, just functional, with mostly benches in the outside dining area.  Regardless, they got my repeat business, just wish they were a little closer so I could eat there for lunch more often."}
{"text":"Very good! Hush puppies are on point. Dont get the potato salad."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good.. I had it today for the first time because I was recommended to eat the wings here so I tried the wings as well as the BBQ and I was pleased with both. The wings were like non other that I have had because seems like they smoke them then deep fry so that is always a plus. I am pretty hard to please, when it comes to food but I will make sure to recommend to my friends  Bubba"}
{"text":"I say give it a try , it was good not amazing but just good, the waitresses have NO time for the customers , she kept walking away in the middle of a sentence i believe her name was Marie , the only nice person in that restaurant is the old lady that seems to be a greeter im not sure. I came in when it was busy so i had to sit near the front of the door but this is usually not a problem for me , the problem was it was also the customer waiting area so the entire meal i had a ass in my face why i tried to eat. I might go back if im starving for barbq just cause its close."}
{"text":"The food here is A+. My husband says some of the best ribs he has had. Pulled pork is well seasoned, hushpuppies are huge and french fries are good. The slaw you can choose between white and red which was vinegar and mayo.  Now for the bad...one of my pet peeves. When you know the wait staff want you to leave! Even spraying chemicals in the same room and vacuuming while we were trying to eat! If you are my guest I would never treat you this way!"}
{"text":"Great that it is so busy since moving across the street, but service has slowed down"}
{"text":"food was good. had the BBQ sandwich, chicken, and ribs for meats and Mac & cheese, beans, white slaw and fries for the sides - all very good.  like another reviewer mentioned, we could smell the BBQ as soon as we walked in but when we were sitting down to eat there was a distinct Clorox wipes smell (and I could see 2 containers in plain sight). overall very good and we would go back."}
{"text":"This restaurant has a great vibe and friendly staff! I've dined here and also had take out and the food is always great. The barbecue is yummy and the portions are generous. I like that the sauces aren't spicy, unlike a lot of barbecue restaurants. Great for kids."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for something barbequed so I placed a take-out order from 521 BBQ Grill.  I ordered baby back ribs, with fries and white cole slaw.  Based on my experience from other places that smoke their meats, I expected the ribs to be moist, tender, and lean.  That was not my experience and it was disappointing especially since it had lots of good Yelp reviews.  The fries a crinkled cut which is my favorite but these were so salty I could not enjoy them even after removing a lot of the salt.  I tried the cole slaw and it was the most disgusting thing I've tasted in a long time.  It ruined my taste buds and upset my stomach so I refrigerated the remaining ribs.  I returned to 521 BBQ Grill for more sauce.  I re-heated the ribs in the oven and added more sauce, they were better the next day.  The sauce was good, so I will probably return to purchase a bottle but nothing else."}
{"text":"Great Q at their new location with grown up beverages.....SWEET! Plenty of new flat screens to enjoy a game. The new location has a good feel with many of the old familiar faces and a few new ones. Would have given 5 stars but need an improved process for takeout! Lots of grumbling and long lines on a busy Saturday night!  They'll figure it out.....still worth the wait on weekends for the BEST Q around!"}
{"text":"This was some really good barbecue. I definitely wouldn't consider myself a barbecue expert due to the fact that I'm not from the south, but the food was good, the perfect amount of tang and zing. We were also seated right away and the food came out very quickly. I would definitely suggest the smoked bone-in chicken breast, it had a fantastic smoky flavor along with their signature barbecue sauce. All the sides were delicious, although I would have preferred a corn hush puppy over an onion one. This is definitely somewhere I would eat again!"}
{"text":"Fun, friendly, family atmosphere. Great food, drinks and service. Can't ask for much more than that!"}
{"text":"I will keep this short and simple.    Our server, Robin, was very friendly and attentive. She was quick to refill our drinks and made sure that she checked on us regularly.   We had a table of 5, two adults and three children. They made us feel welcomed and the food didn't leave us disappointed. I order the ribs plate and my wife ordered the BBQ sandwich with fries. My ribs were prepared wonderfully, fully of delicious meat and very little fat. Nothing was left but the bones after I was done. My wife said that her BBQ sandwich was one of the best ones that she has had in this region of NC/SC.  As for the sides, they were ok. My favorite was the baked beans that had a rich flavor to them. I recommend the red slaw over the white slaw.   We will definitely be back for a round two when our family comes into town!"}
{"text":"I found it on yelp while heading back to WV from GA and wanting BBQ. The GPS took us the long way around but OMG was it worth it. The staff was awesome and the food better. My husband and I both ordered the BBQ platter. It comes with fries and hush puppies. The waitress saw that I was fluctuating between it and the ribs and before we knew it she bought us each a rib to try. Delicious is an understatement. I wish it the restaurant was closer because I would certainly be back. Maybe on our next trip."}
{"text":"Just visited 521 with a food tour...we had an awesome server with an amazing work ethic!  Mike the owner came out to chat with us about the food...very nice guy clearly interested in our feedback. The hush puppies were great. The chopped pork was very good with a nice texture and flavor. The ribs were excellent - tender and moist with a nice crust from the slightly sweet caramelized sauce. Red slaw and white slaw each had distinct flavors. Fries were serviceable. My table mates said the beans were ok but really just beans. They offered a vinegar sauce and a sweet/mildly spicy sauce. The two combined was a nice heat/tang combo. Will definitely be back next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place was delicious! You can't get great barbecue where I'm from, this was a welcome change of pace on our vacation. Hush puppies were great! The ribs and barbecue pork we're good. The mac and cheese with a little bit of barbecue sauce was on point. The beans and coleslaw left a little bit to be desired. Overall I am glad that we stopped, and I would gladly go again."}
{"text":"So I'd like to give more stars however other than the service the bbq leaves me a bit dry.   We were in town shopping and have wanted to try the place out. Ordered the chicken a brisket, both were dry and the brisket was nothing like Texas bbq. If you going to serve Texas style bbq then you should serve it.  This is one bbq pit master to another.   Brisket was dry with little taste, the chicken was dry with light bbq sauce over the top. Not a bad accompaniment but the sauce didn't help the dryness of the chicken.  Service was outstanding. That's about all we liked about the place.  If you looking for great or good bbq I'd probably skip this place."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times just for the ribs. The hush puppies and fried Okra are the bomb. And the sautéd green beans are delicious. I wish there was a location up in the Huntersville area and I'd be there all the time . - Pat"}
{"text":"This hidden gem is on the Lancaster highway in the Harris Teeter shopping center.  Quaint little BBQ restaurant that serves lunch & dinner.    I stopped in for a  Beef brisket dinner sandwich and have to say I was shocked how good it was.  The beef brisket was plentiful and was topped with yummy coleslaw.  The sandwich was so big I took 1/2 home and had lunch leftovers again today.  Complimentary hush puppies served with honey butter were absolutely delicious.   The service was prompt and attentive .    If I lived closer I would probably come back more often... and I have a feeling I will definitely find a reason to drive back that way!   It was delicious!!! Two thumbs way up !"}
{"text":"I come hear every other Friday. Hands Down so far the best Rib place.  Still have yet to be disappointed."}
{"text":"Yes, yes... I'd eat there again.   We're moving in a few weeks and I feel like I need to get on the restaurants I've been living around for almost 2 years and in a night that I craved some BBQ, Yelp told me to come to this place.   I passed by Jim N Nicks BBQ and thought why not just go to this place. It's literally right around the corner from my place. But after looking at the pics, I thought, \"I'll pass\". I'm not knocking the place but 521 looked a lot more appetizing.  This place is in a little convenient plaza. It's small inside. I went to the end of the bar to order as I was told and the only gripe I have was feeling like I was in the way. There's no to go section. It's literally at the end of the bar and you're standing, waiting around patrons sitting at their tables enjoying their meals.   I sat at the bar and the bartender was nice enough to offer me a drink while I waited. I believe I was waiting by the owners maybe. I told the bartender I just wanted to get out of the way of others coming in and the people eating. He politely told me i wasn't in the way. The \"owners?\" heard me say this and they discussed with the bartender moving the tables to have more of a waiting area for the to go people. Where they're going to put the extra tables in chairs. Possibly a storage, etc. I concurred in my head.   I get they're trying to maximize the space especially to avoid having people wait for their food whether dining inside or not. But if they go with the idea of having a small waiting space for to go people. Again... I concur.  The food was GREAT! My pulled pork sandwich with the white Cole slaw was hittin it. I love crinkled cut fries and they were potatoey on the inside and crispy on the outside. My hush puppies were straight. The Mac and cheese was hitting it too. Creamy and cheesy... gooey. I love Mac and cheese! I had the different sauces and I like the mustard and BBQ one. The vinegary one was meh.   I just might go back this weekend. Yea... it was that good."}
{"text":"Wow! This was amazing! We found everything about the place excellent! The hostess was very nice and we were seated immediately. Our server, Christina was great! She brought our drinks out right away. We each ordered a combo plate. I had the BBQ chicken and ribs and hubby had the sausage and grilled pork chop. It came with beans, hush pups, fries and your choice of red or white slaw or potato salad. So, hindsight, too much food! LoL The fries were beautiful crinkle cut and cooked to perfection! The beans were great but a tad but sweet for me so I added some Frank's Red Hit and that did the trick! Hush pups were amazing too! I usually do not eat them! I loved the white slaw! Yumm! My ribs were cooked as if They were for a judge on GrillMasters!  Amazing! Had a nice smokey flavor, sweet and spicy sauce and just the right \"pull\" off the bones. I normally do not like chicken breast but the grilled breast was out of this world! Of course I had to try hubby's fare as well. His grilled pork chop had the best flavor! I put sauce on it - mixed the house sauce (saw that in another review) and it was wonderful! The sausage was DELISH as well. The only thing I didn't care for was the red slaw. My hubby liked it a lot. Just not my cup o tea. Christina kept our drinks filled and gave us a to go cup when we left. She was very pleasant and attentive! Thank you Christina! This is one of the BEST BBQ joints we've ever been to - I'm pretty sure it's my new fav. I only wish we lived a little closer! Keep up the fabulous work!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Excellent service. Best BBQ I've had in a long time! Way better than the Dixie Pig!"}
{"text":"I'm happy this area starting to have more locally owned eatery and less chain restaurants. And don't yell at me if I'm wrong. But I'm assuming 521 is one of the locals. 2 locations. First original opened and owner(Mike) managed that location. 2nd location is this one. Managed by his son. How do I know this. Met him at a cigar shop in Rock Hill. He mentioned to stop by so here I am..  Went today against my diet restriction.. I'm happy I did but I'll pay for it later. I ordered the ribs tray. 6 baby back ribs with white coleslaw, hush puppies, baked beans and Mac n cheese.. as much as I want to love the white coleslaw, it's not for me. Even tho it has a more creamy consistency, it just too peppery.. I couldn't finish it. Now the good part.. their ribs was juicy, fall of the bones, meaty and the sauce was just perfect. Sauce has a sweet yet gave you a little spicy kick. Just a little. I enjoyed it.. the hushpuppies. Oh yummy. I started putting leftover rib sauce on it. Even better. Mac n cheese was good. Not excellent but goes well with the BBQ.  Our waiter was sweet. Almost walked out with their cup in hand and not even paid yet.. too busy talking. She didn't make a scene or fuss at us... A beautiful lady with great personality!   Oh I gave the cup back and PAID.   Check out their weekly specials.. look cool. I'll be back.."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times in the past year and enjoyed it. We went for lunch Saturday and after our order was taken we didn't see our waitress again until the end of the meal when it was time to pay. My husband needed a refill and we finally flagged down the hostess to take care of that. I was sitting where I could see the wait staff and saw our waitress standing around doing very little for much of the time, other than talking to the others.  Makes me not want to go back. Sitting through an entire meal without your waitress checking on you while she's standing in the back is not good customer service."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! The wings are the best. You can taste the smoky flavor in the wings. The baked beans were a little dry/ had a slight old taste. But that is not normal for 521. Never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Great bbq and sauces, the sides are mediocre though. Great indoor atmosphere with nice tables, seating, and staff."}
{"text":"Whitney was a fantastic server!  I ordered a medium ribeye steak sandwich.  It came out closer to medium rare unfortunately this resulted in the bun became that soggy type goop before I was done where you have condiment running down your arm if you don't switch to a knife/fork.  The coleslaw portion as a side was a bit stingy.  It came in the equivalent of 1 of those salad dressing cups that you receive when you order it on the side.  I would have liked another helping.  Hush puppies count'em 3.  The side portions are great for those looking to watch their waist line :) The music that day was a bit what ppl used to think of country as before Toby, Luke, or Blake."}
{"text":"I moved to Sun City and there are no restaurants near by except this one. I have had the rib dinner about 10 times. It is finger lickin good. They are probably the best ribs I have ever eaten EVER. The only reason I cannot give a 5* rating is the sides are a little lacking. The corn meal pups are dry and unpleasant to me. The fries are frozen crinkle cut and no matter how crispy you ask for them to be done you still taste the gushy potato inside. The cole slaw lacks any zip but their baked beans are to die for. The price is so reasonable that I live without getting 3 sides. I have had the BBQ chicken once. It is soooo gooood! Since all I eat at home is chicken or fish I always opt for the ribs. They give you extra sauce but I have NEVER needed it.  Take out service is 15 minutes or less.  PS: I am a NYC girl and have lived in Texas and Arizona so I know good food and good BBQ. I'M A SNOB when it comes to food and this place passes muster. Enjoy and save your appetite if you order the ribs because they give you a nice size portion. If they ever go out of business I'll have to cook more often and that is not an option. . Yummy yummy yummy, good food in my tummy! ASK FOR EXTRA NAPKINS!"}
{"text":"Mike C. told me to go because 521 BBQ & Grill was awesome ... I should have gone sooner and hungrier because he was right!  Located on 521 (you'll think you have missed it... keep driving - it's past my dream residence of Sun City).  Leaving from the Providence edge of Ballantyne, it took me about 30 minutes to get there, but IT WAS WORTH IT.  I'll give it a 4.5 and round up.    Arriving around 11:30ish on a gorgeous Saturday, there wasn't much of a crowd yet, but the friendly waitresses said they usually show up around 12:30 or 1, and as we were wrapping up our lunch, the hungry crowds were rolling in.  Sit anywhere and one of the servers will help you out.  I already knew what I was getting, so we were ready to rock.  The food: Combo plate of ribs and pork BBQ:  The pile of food came on a sectioned styrofoam plate that was being tested of it's strength of will.  I mean it was a PILE of food.  4 meaty ribs, a big scoop of pork bbq, baked beans, 3 big ole hushpuppies, fries and a container of slaw (you get your choice of white, red or mustard slaw). - the ribs - meaty, 2 were excellent, 2 were a little too fatty, but the smoky flavor was delicious.  Our server said they use hickory pellets to smoke their meats and you could taste it for sure.  Delicious on their own, but mopped with the sweet, thick western style sauce they have, YUM - finger lickin' good. - the pulled pork - smoky flavor, served plain or you could add the sweet western sauce, spicy eastern style or mustard based.  I went with the western, my buddy went with the spicy and then the mustard, and the unanimous vote was winner all the way through.   - baked beans - they were baked beans, they were fine.  Smoky flavor with some onions - I prefer my mom's sweeter recipe (with BACON on top), but these were good. - french fries - these were your standard frozen crinkle cut fries, but they were double fried or something with an extra layer of crunch on the outside.  Yummy.   - hushpuppies - crispy fried delicious balls of love handles - these were awesome.  Nothing fancy, just deep fried dough. - white slaw - meh, wasn't a fan, tasted more like plain mayo than slaw sauce, but who cares... it's slaw and quite honestly I would rather take up stomach real estate with meat instead of slaw.  The grand total for a drink and this combo was just over $16.  That's right, I said $16.  This platter in Charlotte would have easily cost $20 and the quality would have been nowhere near what I got at 521 (I am talking to you Moe's and Harper's!).  It was a mountain of delicious food, served by friendly servers.  We ooh'ed and aah'ed our way through the meal and will DEFINITELY return for more.  Great job, 521 BBQ & Grill!"}
{"text":"Loved it....... ribs were awesome and so was the bbq pork. Hush puppies delish and mac & cheese out of this world. Super nice service and great food at a reasonable price. We will definitely be going back as it is always nice to get a quality meal from a local restaurant"}
{"text":"North Carolinians are known to be barbecue snobs so the fact that this place is so popular should speak volumes. 521 is the best barbecue in the area. Servers are always friendly! The atmosphere is so comfortable and rustic. You really can't go wrong with anything here"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!! Guys you must try this gem. Lived here for nearly 2 years and finally decided to give it a try! The baby back ribs are ridiculously good! The hush puppies, beans, and fries are good. Def a place to come and pig out."}
{"text":"Our family loves 521, we live 5 mins from the place. We love their BBQ sandwiches, ribs, hush puppies, beans and sweet tea!  We've had decent service most times we eat in, and we love the 'to go' part of the restaurant. Tonight we attempted to call two different times, so that we could place a TO GO order. The phone rang and rang with no answer each time. We decided to go up there to order to go instead. The place was pretty packed, and people were waiting to dine in. We went to the area where you pick up TO GO orders and asked if we could place an order to go. The lady looked at us, then at the line of people waiting to dine in, and then told us 'Hunny we don't have time for that'. We just stood there staring at her surprised. Needless to say, we left hungry and disappointed in this level of customer service.  Why would you turn customers away? Could she not have just told us it would be a certain wait time? This level of customer service definitely put a damper on our view of 521 BBQ."}
{"text":"We pass 4 other BBQ places on our way here- but 521 is worth it! Great atmosphere, phenomenal customer service and ridiculously amazing food! They have a nice selection of meats- I think we've tried everything and it's hard to pick because they are all good. They also have a variety of delicious sides including slaw, fries, fried okra, greened beans, collard greens, mac n cheese, and potato salad. You really can't go wrong with any of them! Hush puppies come with the meal and they are excellent too! 521 is worth visiting- you won't leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"Did I tell you about the combo plates?    Went in for lunch and was surprised that it was not mobbed, being a Tuesday and beef brisket day.  Was alone, so did not want to take up a table, saw a uniformed sheriff deputy sitting along and asked if I could join him.  Davie was his name and a nice guy.  I like law enforcement and wish there were many more around.    I ordered the beef brisket and his plate came with wonderful looking wings and a pile of chopped pork BBQ.  Ohhhhh.  Had not considered combo plates so that knocked me out of my ordering rut.  The waitress came up and I asked if I could try a wing, a HOT wing and so it was.  I am a fussy guy on wings as I hate the soggy rawish ones, preferring crispy.  I got it!  It was fried to perfection and they then put it on the ribbed fire grill to get that smoky burn and then put on some form of sauce.  Yummy.  It was really good and made the beef brisket seem rather ordinary.  I kept making lustful glances at the deputys wings, but behaved and just munched my now seemingly boring beef.  This is a great place, friendly and if you have visitors not familiar with the South, southern food, hospitality and humor, bring them to 521.  We brought a German couple and they were blown away, begging to buy a \"Butts rubbed nightly\" t-shirt.  Wonder how that translates into German?  The manager gave them one on the condition that they send a photo wearing it in Germany.  Gunter sent three photos by email and the 521 crew were very pleased, indeed.  Now with world-wide presence.  Make your presence there and you will understand why."}
{"text":"New to tega cay, sc... This place was great. Ordered the rib plate and chopped pork- both were amazing. Very casual, great beers on tap and the cole slaw was fantastic."}
{"text":"Amazing, had the wings which were very flavorful and tender. Chopped pork was fantastic and the ribs had a wonderful flavor and fall off the bone tender! The sides were all very good, some BBQ places sides are more of an after thought but not here, the potato salad and red slaw were fantastic however just way to small a portion. Beans and hush puppies very good! I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I don't like that they use styrofoam for so much.  I did like the pulled pork BBQ tray - the meat was great. I did NOT like the 'red slaw' it is Ketchup based. After I added some of the great spicy vinegar based sauce it was good.  I hear the ribs are great, but that's not my favorite.   I don't have a reason to make this a destination spot."}
{"text":"Will be back. Again and again. Service was friendly, fast and efficient. Sweet tea, or as I am learning, \"tea\" was refilled without asking. BBQ beef was perfectly cooked. Great flavor, moisture and not fatty. Soft bun.   Perfectly cooked fries. Their sauce has the taste you hope for, and for my palette the extra hot sauce kicked it up to the sky. So happy they exist."}
{"text":"High hopes not met. The ribs were a bit tough for having been smoked all day and the brisket was dry. I was the first customer of the day so perhaps I got yesterday's reheat. I usually love BBQ. 521, unfortunately, did not satisfy.   Their hush puppies are good though.  So there is that."}
{"text":"Great down home BBQ and it's eat in, carry out and bulk ordering. The sauce is traditional red sauce with a touch of vinegar. The Mac and cheese and cole sale are NOT good but the hush puppies and beans are spot on good!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ and you can order in bulk fresh and frozen. The bar staff are very cool and will give you a sample of the new drafts on tap. I especially like the Hop Drop and Roll and would have never discovered it if a sample wasn't offered."}
{"text":"I went here with my hubby. You know me. I can't touch the meat, because of my cholesterol so I was going to get sides. Guess what friends that was not an easy task. Couldn't get a veggie burger either, but I ate some beans and a tea. Everything was just ok. Not great. Not horrible either. The problem is you can get  better choices elsewhere for a lot less money. :("}
{"text":"My son went to the fort mill location and ordered 2 steak sandwiches for take out. When he got home the sandwiches were BLT's. I called there and after the 30th someone answered the phone and I told her what the problem was she said that she took the order and he order the BLT. I said no he would not ordered that because the steak sandwich is all we get. She argued with me telling no I was wrong.  Probably will not come back because Ike customer service."}
{"text":"My sister picked this up for dinner on Monday night.  We had ribs and pulled pork, the kids had grilled cheese and french fries.  The adult platters came with french fries, cole slaw, baked beans and hush puppies.  Everything was really good, except the fries were nothing special.  Ribs were nice and meaty, pork was really flavorful, coleslaw was tasty, even though it had a lot of black pepper in it and I usually hate pepper, the beans were good and I usually don't care for beans, and the hush puppies really were delicious.  A very solid meal and a great find closer to my sisters new digs in Waxhaw!"}
{"text":"I was out and about on a Saturday in the southern part of Charlotte, NC.  I realized that I was within striking distance of a BBQ joint that I had not tried yet.  So at the recommendation of my friend Steve Gibbs, I decided to stop in at 521 BBQ & Grill in Indian Land, SC.  This BBQ joint is located approximately 10-15 minutes from the Ballantyne area of Charlotte, just over the NC/SC state line.  The decor of the place is very down-home, with picnic tables nestled among standard restaurant tables.  The menu at 521 BBQ & Grill offers pulled pork and ribs as well as items off of the grill (pork chops, chicken, etc.).  After perusing the menu for a few minutes (and soliciting the advice of the super-cute waitress who took care of me), I decided on the BBQ tray which consists of pulled pork (which ended up looking closer to chopped than pulled), fries, and hush puppies.  The first bite of pork was just a little bit on the dry side.  After that, it was absolutely delicious!  The pork had a beautiful color, with bits and pieces of the outside bark mixed in.  It had a nice touch of smoke in the taste, thus allowing the pork to be the star.  I'll visit the sides shortly, but I want to talk about the sauces.  There are 2 different sauces available -- a thick sweet Kansas City style sauce and a vinegar based sauce.  The KC style sauce was very thick, very sweet, with a nice touch of smoke.  It went well with the pork.  The vinegar-based sauce, on the other hand...  it was fabulous!  The color of the sauce is a darker color than most traditional vinegar-based sauces (very similar to the homemade vinegar-based sauce that I make).  This sauce really gave the pork that extra zing.  Excellent sauce!  Now, back to the sides...  the fries were fried up perfectly.  They were very crispy and flavorful on the outside.  The hush puppies were tasty as well, although I would've liked to have seen just a touch more flavor in them.  Nevertheless, I ate them anyway.  So is it worth the trip from Charlotte to Indian Land to check out this joint?  Without a doubt!  I'm certainly glad I checked it out.

{"text":"Try the smoked and fried wings!!! Also the vinegar based BBQ sauce is perfect on a chopped sandwich with slaw. Great lunch spot. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"Gross. Do not recommend. Not to mention the owner is not friendly at all!  I recommend City Bbq for good BBQ"}
{"text":"Went for first time tonight. Service was great and fast. I had wings which were great.  But my husband said ribs were fatty and undercooked.  Hush puppies were good also. But , the first time eating them so I have nothing to compare to. Would go back to try other menu items.  Server was very nice !"}
{"text":"This place is great. We love the barbecue and service you get... We strongly recommend this place for barbecue."}
{"text":"Ribs are tender and meaty (tip: order the center cut ribs). They are, essentially, fall off the bone as we all like to report. But, sometimes fall off the bone means watery and spongy. Not good. These are not too wet; not too dry. Personally, I like to have something for my teeth to sink into and chew. These are perfect!  I am not going to comment on the sides or the sauce. Why not?  When the ribs are this good, who cares?"}
{"text":"This is a new location near us and it's nice to have local food by local folks. The inside is well done. Nice decorations and new.  I could do without the big dirty BBQ pit out front spilling out smoke as you walk in. I also don't know who is in thinks is a quality BBQ joint using KINGSFORD wood and charcoal? Really? Are you serious? You are using store wood and stuff? That's not how you do BBQ.  I want to eat BBQ not smell like it. Plus the idea that my lunch is being transported from the parking lot to the kitchen....NO!  The inside is arrange really funny. There is this dedicated BAR area which seems to be the focus inside and then the side where the people who come to eat BBQ sit. What is the focus BBQ or BAR. Pick on and try to do it well and stop doing both. It's the BOTH that gets people into trouble. Do one thing GREAT and do it all the time. Stop trying to be everything. The menu reflect this mess as well.   So the sign says BBQ but the inside says BAR. It's kind of confusing.  The menu is a mess. There is BBQ but then you have all this other stuff and I guess that's the BAR side or the GRILL side of things.  BBQ joints should be a half page of perfection in big print. Make BBQ and make it well but stop all the other stuff no one wants and if it comes in a freezer bag in a truck you are doing BBQ wrong!  I had the LARGE BBQ Sam'ich and my son had the Pork Chop Sam'ich.  So while we were waiting other people came in and were served drinks and then served meals while we waited. There was about a 15 min. wait for the food. My BBQ showed up and the bun was cold. Very cold. Never heated up cold. Been sitting out on the counter cold. The meat was a bit warmer but I am guessing not the right temp at all. Loads of meat but the bun being cold was not good. The server seemed confused when I told her and offered to heat it up? My question was \"Do you warm the buns\" and she said she didn't know.  The Pork Chop Sam'ich didn't taste like anything at all. It was boring. Tasted like I would have made them at home. I don't go out to eat to eat stuff I can make at home. Make is spectacular or stop making it. Not enough meat on the bun and just boring taste overall.   The 2 sauces are a bit boring too. The Tangy Sauce has way too much going on and the Vinegar based sauce is just a mess of flavors and such. I will commend them on just doing 2 sauces. Most bad BBQ places will have 3 or 4 sauces to try to cover up for them not knowing anything about BBQ. Would have loved a Mustard/Tomatoe Sauce but...meh.  The ice maker/drink station is right in the middle of the seated area and is noisy. It's distracting.   The service was OK but clearly this place is another BBQ joint being run by a few people who entered BBQ contest, won, and then someone told them to open a joint and this is the result.   It's just not working.   They have no idea how to run a restaurant and hope the big smoker thing and a decorated interior is going to make for a good place to eat, when in fact it's not. The price was not bad but $23 for lunch for 2 people and nothing crazy it is a bit much for 2 people. Don't feel like it was anything special.  Overall this was a huge disappointment. I won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Never disappointed. Wonderful food, good service and good prices!! Whole family enjoys eating here! Have taken many people there visiting from out of town and they love it as well! Can get busy very quickly so go around 5! Or early for lunch!! Outdoor seating available too"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best BBQ in the area! They smoke it out front daily. The prices are very reasonable and the staff is always friendly. The inside of the restaurant is always neat and clean with nice decor. This is one of my family's favorite spots to eat at!"}
{"text":"521 is our only stop for local BBQ and ribs. The food has always been fresh, and the new owner is always on premises checking on the servers, food and quality. Our servers have always been courteous and personable. If you want local, quality BBQ cooked by local chefs, at a good price with great portions, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"This was the very first place where I tried Carolinas style BBQ pork and ribs and after trying several BBQ joints around the area, I must admit that the bar was set pretty high. I have tried most of their menu but their best item by far are the ribs. Side dishes are just OK with the exception of the hush puppies. Don't expect restaurant level service. Food comes in Styrofoam plates with plastic spoon and forks and customer service is just average. Expect to wait anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes to get seated on busy times like weekends and evenings.  Having said all this, I still keep coming back for the ribs."}
{"text":"After closing on our home our realtor mentioned this would be a great place to try for lunch and he was right.  The BBQ sandwich special I ordered was great and the onion rings were perfect.  Would definitely go to again.  I will say this though.  If you do want to try this place out go early because the seating is limited and it fills up quick!"}
{"text":"We have been to 521 Barbeque several times both the fort Mill (Tega Cay) and the Indian Land location this was by far the worst experience I have had at one of their restaurants. When we arrived it was a party of five adults and one three-year-old we were told the inside was full of want to sit outside it would be faster service so we elected to sit outside. We are seated at a picnic table and it was at least 10 minutes before anyone came to even take our drink orders.     It went downhill from there we had at least three different waitresses I still can't tell you who our real waitress was they finally came back and took our food orders and brought the drinks and dropped a basket of hush puppies no napkins no utensils no nothing just the hush puppy in a basket on the table.          It was just about an hour from the time we seated until we got our first servings of food and they said they would be coming right out with the three-year-olds Mac and cheese. It was another 10 minutes with two trips from the manager saying they were coming right out before she got her mac & cheese it got to the point where she turned to her grandmother and started crying because everyone else had their food but not her.      We had to ask for utensils we had asked for napkins two of the people ordered ribs they weren't given any extra napkins no wipes like you normally get when you order ribs. I had to get up and walk inside the building to get napkins so that they could clean their hands.    Everyone's barbecue was cold it wasn't even lukewarm. I talked to the manager briefly because I was so upset I was afraid what I would say, she did discount our bill but that's not the point the service was absolutely horrendous and the food was mediocre at best because it was cold.     Like I said at the beginning we have been to their barbecue for many years but it will take a lot of convincing  to get me to go back again at least to the Fort Mill location."}
{"text":"It appears this once great BBQ restaurant has been sold or changed management hands to two gentlemen from Turkey. When asked where the new management was we were informed they were out of the country. Service and food are going downhill fast. The restaurant was only about half full on a Saturday. Prior to our in person visit we tried to order takeout the week prior but gave up after calling five times with no answer. Very very sad is all I can say."}
{"text":"My fiance likes to go here for lunch since his work is nearby. Back in early summer before I started working in the Steele Creek area I would meet him on occassion here for lunch, and holy moly-- they have some high baller bbq.   When you walk in, the first impression is....how to say... Most definitely not a bistro atmosphere. But do overlook the decor (if you are accustomed to the Epicenter or Myers Park, all the rebel flags may be a little alarming), because the food is worth it and the ladies that work there are real southern belles-- just as sweet as their iced tea. When you walk in, go to the counter at the back-- you'll see one of the girls at the register, and the menus are up there as well. Place your order, and depending on how busy it is, you can either seat yourself, or one of the waitresses will seat you. The food is fresh and cooked following your order. The kitchen is open, so you can see the cooks doing what they do best-- frying up hush puppies, oninon rings, and basting ribs.   I can't help myself when I dine here-- I always get the same thing. It's delicious, and always hits the spot: Pulled pork bbq sandwich with a side of onion rings, and a sweet tea. My fiance, Casey, always orders the rib tray with hush puppies on the side. The first time I ordered the sandwich, I couldn't believe there was no sauce on the meat. See what you have to do is squirt that bad boy on yourself; on each table are those ketchup-like squirt bottles filled with different flavors of bbq sauce. I like to mix the two (the thicker, sweet bbq sauce is dark, and the other more vinegar one has red pepper and other spices floating around in it) . Oh so yummy. I've come to prefer it this way because I can decided how much sauce I want. The onion rings are thickly battered and fried to perfection. You won't go hungry here-- the sides are ample.   I usually eat a bit of Casey's ribs, and the funny thing is every time I do, I say that I will order that dish next time, but never do. It's funny how people fall into patterns and crave the same dish from certain restaurants. The hush puppies are delightful; slightly sweet, and perfect for cutting the richness of the ribs. Born and raised right here in Charlotte, NC, I know good sweet tea when I taste it, and this place has the mix down. Too sugary, and you get the pucker-face; not sweet enough, and you'll see scowls and muttering. Just right, and you'll see an empty glass. I usually leave with an empty glass at this restaurant.  If you dig on the pig, check this place out! It's worth the drive for sure."}
{"text":"Brought the family here for the first time on Saturday.  Very good BBQ.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We had a 20 min wait which was great. But got to the table and ordered the food and we had to wait 20 mins for some mozzarella sticks, and then it was over 1hr to get the food which was cold!!!!!  Got home and reheated the food and it was good. So hope you get a good waitress that one sucked and will not go back again to that one."}
{"text":"Surprisingly, I have never been down here after 7 years of living in South Charlotte. My mom recently discovered this place and fell in love with it. We went on a Saturday for lunch. The restaurant itself is in a little strip of stores off of...521 (surprise!). When you enter, you seat yourself and then a waiter/waitress takes it from there.  We sat at a picnic table looking table and were given menus and drinks shortly after. For lunch, I got a large BBQ sandwich with red slaw. There was a choice between red and white slaw--the red is vinegar based and the white is mayo based. The food came out in about 15 minutes, and the sandwich was pretty good! Not the best in the world, but a very solid sandwich. Cole slaw was good, pork was good, added some sauce and that was good too. I tried one of my mom's hush puppies--hands down the best hush puppy I've had. Delicious. Fries were very good as well.  Service was very down-home Southern. Nice, charming waitress who was all smiles and patient with our questions. It made the whole visit feel more authentic. I'd go back--although both Shane's and Elwood's are closer so it makes it harder to justify going to 521. But the hush puppies..."}
{"text":"After a long day of running errands, I had a hankering for some BBQ. I've enjoyed Shane's Rib Shack already, plus reviews on this place were better so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Service was welcoming which is oh so important. Plus it's cleaner than Shane's. I'm not sure they have better ribs but their ribs are good. And the grilled pork chop? Who would've known? I'll be ordering those again. Beans were fine, nothing spectacular, same with their smoked wings. But I must say, as a born and bred north easterner, what are these things called hush puppies and where have they been all my life?? Sheesh, I'd go for those alone. I've since had hush puppies at other joints and these still stand out. Pork chops, hush puppies and beer. Sounds like a good meal to me."}
{"text":"On our trip from California we were very excited to find this place! The ribs were amazing as was the potato salad and slaw. Equally as good was the service! Thank you for your hospitality."}
{"text":"Must try.  Worth the drive from Charlote/Ballantyne.  Rib Tray all the Way!"}
{"text":"I got the lunch special BBQ tray, the meat was cold-i-sh, fries and pups were pretty dry. First place I tried BBQ since we moved to charlotte, not a big fan. I also don't like a  restaurant serve their food in paper plate and plastic Utensils, feels more like a fast food place than a  restaurant, but the staffs are nice and friendly tho."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've had in the Charlotte area. It's cheap, fast, and smoked. Can't get any better than that. For lunch I usually just get their BBQ sandwich with fries for $4.75. The chicken and the burgers are grilled on a ACTUAL charcoal grill so you're getting some real good flavor there. Awesome sweet tea too. Keep in mind that you're in South Carolina, folks. You're going to get your meal in a paper basket or a styrofoam plate or cup. It's how they roll because they have a pretty high turnover of people."}
{"text":"Up from Florida and we were looking for some local BBQ and craft beers. This restaurant had both. BBQ was great and local craft beer selection was good also!"}
{"text":"Best barbecue in two states! Smoke rings in the wings ribs and everything else. Barbecue sauce is killer and I always buy a bottle to take home. I stopped making barbecue at home because I can't do it as well as 521 BBQ and Grill. If you love barbecue give them a try."}
{"text":"I haven't been yelping for a while but after finding this gem while visiting family last week in Charlotte. I said to my self that I have to write this. We ate family style. We had BBQ plate, Rib plate, BBQ Wings, Brisket plate. Generous portions, clean and fresh food. BBQ had a nice bark to it. I will definetely stop by here again. Great Job guys."}
{"text":"Went there last Friday night  Food and service was excellent  Very crowed tables very close Only problem the waiting area for take out was very small only 2 chairs not good Food portions very large and price for what you get is very good Will go back Get there early very crowed"}
{"text":"Another great surprise for us... These guys serve excellent barbecue, topped only by the super-friendly service! I had a pulled-pork sandwich, and (like other reviews have pointed out) their BBQ sauce was right-on!  Prices are fair, and we are definitely going back to try those ribs!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite locations for BBQ in the Charlotte area and within the state of South Carolina. Their style leans more towards North Carolina. This review and include picture is from a previous visit. Now that the location in Tega Cay is open we tend to visit there more often. The picture is from 8/24/2012.   Ribs: I am not a fan of their ribs. They are good but just not my style. You'll like them regardless. A bit short and fatty.  The Pork: When they get it right they get it right. Consistency like at many BBQ locations suffers. But most time the Boston butt is moist and smoked nicely. And they have a very good vinegar sauce.  They offer both a red and white slaw. I've grown fond of ordering the white slaw and adding the vinegar sauce to it. Kind of giving you the best of both red and white slaw. When you order a plate they give you fries but they will allow you to substitute the fries with a slaw. I am not a fan of their fries.  Their plates include a pretty good order of baked beans. You eat as much BBQ as I do and always try to order baked beans... well you get a little picky. I'd rate the baked beans as average. You'll like them but you'll not be \"writing home\" about them.  Their hush puppies are pretty good, a little sweeter than you'd normally find."}
{"text":"This is not the first time to this location . It is closer than Indian Land , SC location. And of course being in Tega Cay it is a nicer atmosphere for those that cannot get along with a more \"traditional\" setting. Like most visits to;"}
{"text":"Simply...BEST BBQ EVER!!! We are visiting from the North East and loved the atmosphere in the area. Loved the ribs, BBQ & the hushpuppies were divine. Can't wait to go back! Great for children and families!"}
{"text":"Our favorite rib restaurant changed ownership and unfortunately the ribs are not good. A real loss to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Brisket is best ever! Wings and pulled pork are awesome too."}
{"text":"I had a plate of the ribs which they're famous for  They were very delicious and tender but not as meaty  as I would like  One would have to pay a little extra to get the center cut ribs if they wish  The rib plate came along with  2 delicious sides of which I had their slaw, two types one a mayonnaise-based which I had  and another ketchup base.  I also chose  green beans in olives and garlic oil as my other side.  Hush puppies and french fries are also considered standard but I preferred my vegetables instead.  Other sides to choose from to such as fried okra, a southern standard. The waitress was very friendly and the place was packed. The menu also included sandwiches and salads  I would definitely come back another time and try something else .  They are also open seven days a week, just a great place for your lunch and dinner cravings if you  enjoy southern food, especially BBB and ribs."}
{"text":"Fantastic 'Q/ribs. CROWDED. Spastic servers. Plentiful outdoors, screened dining."}
{"text":"LOVE pretty much all the food here.  Best wings and ribs in the area.   Pulled pork excellent.  No complaints on sides either.   Like the new place and decor.   People very nice who work there.   Especially the young man host at the door.   ISSUES:  ALWAYS run out of pulled pork.  Has happened many times for me.   Brisket is very good,  but only available certain days.   Often times too busy (good problem!).   Probably need more room."}
{"text":"The bbq here is very very good.  Four of us.  Service was great.  Place was clean and nice.  The only thing is we got the ribs and they were supposed to be baby back ribs and they were more like spare ribs.  They were still very good.  But not a baby back cut.  Sauce was excellent.  Beef brisket was excellent.  Hush puppies collards Mac and cheese very good.  Red slaw way to hot and spicy.  Not red enough.  Beans were rather mediocre.  All in all we will go back.  I'd have ribs again.  Mac and cheese, collards puppies and BBQ."}
{"text":"I was in Charlotte for a week on business and a colleague recommended 521 as \"the best BBQ you've ever tasted.\" He's from NJ, so maybe that skewed things, but 521 was good. Not great.  I got the ribs and received the thick end of the rack, plus two ribs from the thin end. The ribs from the thin end got a 9.5/10 rating. Well smoked, pull-apart and with a delicious crunchy glaze. The ribs from the thick end were cooked, but not to the point of BBQ doneness. They were tough to the point that I had to stop at CVS and buy dental floss.   Eventually I gave up on them, and just ate the excellent hush puppies and mac & cheese. Good sweet tea and friendly enough service. Clearly a joint for locals but it was friendly.  Nice place overall. Maybe I just got a bad plate. On my next trip to Charlotte I may go back based upon those two excellent ribs."}
{"text":"Food is ok ... There is BBQ all over, and this place does a pretty good job.  Their service .... Slow Slow Slow.   Hello ... When you come in at Lunch, it should not take an hour + to get out when you order a pulled pork sandwich and fries. Damn, you advertise that the meat was cooked last night.   A party of three ordered after us and was served before us.    We're scratching this place off our list of lunch stops."}
{"text":"Line to get in is less about popularity, more related to absence of full-time busboy.  I've seen half the tables filled with customers while remaining half stand empty for 5  ... 15 minutes awaiting clearing.  Hostess has bizarre procedure of seating those who've just walked in vs. families waiting in line for 25 minutes.  Must be a NY thing.  Coping an attitude towards customers and micromanaging wait staff certainly is.  Latter explains why our server got most of the order wrong.  When you tune out the boss, can't help doing the same with customers.  Wall décor makes ambiance more depressing than it otherwise should be"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ, pulled pork was very tender and the chicken tasted great as well.  Also love the two different types of slaw.  Delicious."}
{"text":"first of loved this place always come 3 times or more a month used to go to old location, today we came in waiting 10 minutes to just place a drink order 3 other family's came in and were seated and were already given drinks so disappointed and now will never come back and will never recommend to anyone 1 bad visit will ruin it all for me thanks oh btw never got a drink ordered !!"}
{"text":"We've been there a few times and got their bbq. It was pretty good so I decided to go back last Saturday and pick up some wings. I ordered a dozen hot and a dozen mild. I thought it was all good. But when I got back I realized that they had given me two dozen bbq. I have two children and just couldn't go back and get the correct ones. Then tonight I decided I'd give them another chance. I ordered a dozen hot with blue cheese. I popped the top when I was there, glanced at them real quick and it seemed as if all was good. But when I got back to the house I realized they only gave me nine when I paid for a dozen. They were also over cooked. I will not be back here again for wings."}
{"text":"Great place to unwind, have a cold beer and eat some good BBQ. The folks here are great, the servings are very generous, and the food is great!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot for work and eat lots of wings,  hands down top two places I've ever ate wings at.  Smoked,  then fried then grilled and sauced.  To die for.  Little upset I didn't try them earlier,  I've been looking for a good wing place for a while.  Thank goodness I found one!    Also,  good selection of beer,  15 tap beers and about that many in a bottle."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice now, we have had the ribs, chicken and Pulled Pork.  The meats were cooked very well, moist and not overdone.  They also have the best \"pups\" I have ever had. I however did not like their sauces at all; I couldn't eat much because of that.  I was also disappointed that they do not have a \"chicken on the bone\" in their menu line-up."}
{"text":"This was my first time at 521 BBQ and I was FLOORED by the great tasting ribs and \"Q\"... in fact, I've eaten ALL sorts of BBQ across the US and I am now placing 521 in the Top 10...  KUDOS!!!  Even the take-away was great the day after... I love the various sauces.  Service was very friendly and the decor was just so-so... but who in heck gives a damn about a BBQ restaurant's decor... LOL"}
{"text":"The BBQ here is rather good but you have to try the MAC & CHEESE!   This location is fairly new but they provide the same quality food as the 521 location.  If you want good BBQ, don't hesitate to give them a try!"}
{"text":"I stopped at 521 for lunch. It was very busy and crowded. They offered a very reasonably priced lunch menu. I tried their bbq pork sandwich which I found to be a little bit of a small portion but it was good and for $5.00 with fries I found it to be a good find."}
{"text":"Ok food - very expensive for the portions and busy - crazy busy on weekend - more a bar feel.. did not enjoy - live music sometimes outside - very loud"}
{"text":"There's some nights you just want a good plate of BBQ you know?  That night, for me was last night.  I decided to leave my wife at home and run out to 521 BBQ & Grill because it's not that far from the house and I've heard good things.  I took my 4 year old to show her the way of the carnivore that she calls \"Daddy\".  Arrived on a Saturday night around 6:30 and the place was full.    Ambiance of the place was about what you'd expect for a strip mall type BBQ joint.  Checkered tablecloths, wood paneling, lots of old people from the retirement community across the street, one TV.  My daughter and I were sat in an empty corner which was OK for me because I wound up not embarrassing myself when I engorged myself like a junkyard dog devouring the ribs I was about to receive.  Lord help me!  I ordered the Combination plate of BBQ Ribs and pulled pork which was accompanied by hush puppies, slaw, and beans and of course sweet tea.  The kid got a hot dog, french fries and a side of mac and cheese since I have a rule that if a place serves homemade mac and cheese it is my duty to try it.  The ribs were, to say the least AWESOME!!!  Baby backs, slow roasted with a slight tinge of hickory smoke covered with a slightly sweet, tomatoey sauce that was glazed on the top which tells you that they were not sitting in a holding pot all day .  The meat fell off the bone and was the perfect combination of moist and succulent.  I could have eaten a full rack but there was BBQ to be eaten also!  The pulled pork was also moist and tender with a slight, not overpowering taste of hickory smoke.  The kind of meat you get when you stay up all night with 4 cases of PBR slow roasting the pig yourself with Ol Hank playing in the background (Darn memories).  The accompanying sauces on the table were well put together, I'm not a spicy hot fan so I went with the mild which was smoky, sweet and perfect on the pork.  Beans were tasty, hushpuppies were passable and need work but that's OK because I couldn't stuff one more thing in my mouth when I left, the slaw also needed work maybe more vinegar, it was pretty tasteless and even a little off flavor, it's a shame since I like to mix my slaw in with the BBQ but not to worry again it left me more room for the awesome Q.  The Mac and cheese which wasn't on the menu was very good.  Perfect combination of cheese and my daughter ate the entire serving which enough said there if she ate it all, it's good!  The service was OK.  My server was a bit scattered I ran out of tea once and she asked me a few times after she left the table what I ordered, this would have been a bigger deal if the food wasn't so wonderful.   All in all, this BBQ experience was one of the best around and I hate that I haven't been here sooner.  BBQ is a funny thing in this area it's either awesome or middle of the road....the places that suck don't last long.  You can go to places like Sonny's and just fill your belly, or try this place which will bring you back time after time and make you wish you didn't dawn the doors of a middle of the road BBQ place.  Well done 521 BBQ, I'm a fan and will be back and next time I'll bring some friends."}
{"text":"This is by no means a 4-star place. The BBQ is hit and miss. I've eaten here a few times now since it has gotten good reviews from yelpers. But honestly, it's not great BBQ. Don't order the chicken, pulled pork and ribs are meh at best."}
{"text":"When I'm in town to visit my sister and her family this place is a must go to. The ribs are hands down the best in the business and I crave for this place when I am not in town. Forget your tiny babyback ribs at these little wanna be rob restaurants all you need is the real deal ribs at 521 Ribs. ."}
{"text":"We don't have a ton of Resturants in Tega Cay, but the ones we have are AMAZING!  521 BBQ never disappoints.  Best BBQ in the entire township."}
{"text":"Really good Bbq and reasonably priced. One star deduction because they seem to always be running out of different menu items."}
{"text":"The only reason that we went here is because it was in the same complex as where we got a haircut. I am a Texas boy whose wife doesn't like barbecue, so I am picky and I don't get to eat it often. The brisket was good, but the collard greens and the sauces were amazing. They also had Noda beer on draft which made me very happy. My six-year-old thought it was the best hamburger ever, I quote.  Friendly and attentive staff, as well."}
{"text":"Was in town for business and had some time to get a bite to eat. I pulled up Yelp to see what was around and found magic words BBQ. I sat at the bar and took the advice to try the center cut ribs.   Let me tell you, I LOVE ribs, and these ribs are way up there on my best rib list. Easily some of the most tender, juice, and meaty. The only issue they didn't have the smoke flavor I was looking for. The BBQ sauce was tangy and had a little heat, but I found it was a little too much vinegar. I also wish they put the ribs on the grill to give them a nice char. The hush puppies are large, and moist, but a little too much onion flavor for my liking. Still a very good hush puppy.   The service is by far the shining star, everyone was so amazingly friendly. Service was quick, and I love they provided a rib bowl for the bones, must say that is a first at a restaurant kind of nice touch. They also had wet wipes and provided them with out being asked for them.   Great place to eat, the ribs are worth it!"}
{"text":"We just cannot get enough of this barbecue. The service is always fast and friendly, the food is always delicious. The best barbecue we have had since moving to sc.  I highly suggest the hush puppies and the BBQ sandwich. The sweet tea is my son's favorite and he orders it by the jug to take home. We have loved everything we have tried so far, and keep going back for more!"}
{"text":"The owner was very accommodating for my husband and I on Christmas Eve. Even though they were in the process of relocating, he went above and beyond for us!!!! Couldn't have asked for a better situation. The food is beyond spectacular as well!! Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"Very good BBQ place. The first time we went, it was good. The second time we went it was REALLY good! The ribs were carmelized perfectly. I only wish I had put more sauce on my ribs, but I didn't want to pause to take the time to do it.. they were THAT good! Their pulled pork is also very good... their sweet sauce compliments it perfectly. I didn't use the vinegar sauce so I can't tell you how it is.  The hush puppies were among the best I've had and their baked beans are very good. The cole slaw is part of the reason for the 4 stars instead of five. Both white and red slaw are pretty weak.  Overall, this is a very solid BBQ restaurant. If you're ever down in Indian Land or heading to Lancaster, make the stop."}
{"text":"This place rocks! The food, service and staff. Great Barbecue and at a great price."}
{"text":"Love the ribs from here. I don't ever eat in though. My husband will stop here on his way home from work & pick us up a rack.   My negatives are the side item choices. They have several but fries don't travel well & I personally don't like potato salads or beans. I wish they had something like Mac n cheese or mashed potatoes. I personally don't like the coleslaws.  So when we get the BBQ we just make sides at home"}
{"text":"We love this place!   Been here many times and they have spoiled making ribs at home because I cannot come close.   The white slaw and collards are great too.  My wife loves the chopped pork....recommends mixing the sauces with the mustard sauce.   We recommend 521 to anyone who is looking for great BBQ.  We will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Dinner here tonight was amazing. The service was good and the food was outstanding. The hush puppies with the whipped honey spread are the best I've ever had - crispy and delicious.   I ordered the BBQ Ribs, Mac & Cheese, & Cole Slaw. The BBQ ribs were perfect. Juicy and the flavor was out of this world. The sides were both great.  Everyone at our table enjoyed their meals.  Sadly I did not take any pictures as I had my hands full with a one year old. He also loved everything we gave him! We can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I've eaten at 521 BBQ several times and I've always enjoyed the pulled pork.  It's always been fresh and tasty.  It's also very clean as in there's not a lot of fat in it.  The fries, hushpuppies, and slaw are very good as well and the waitresses have always been very friendly.    The ribs on the other hand are some of the worst I've ever had :(!!!  I've tried them twice and they have always been very tuff and basically not edible.  I've read the other reviews and was surprised to see others mention how good they are.  Maybe I just hit them on two bad days, but my advice as of right now is too stay as far away as you can from the ribs.  Just go and enjoy the pulled pork.  I think they serve chicken there as well but I've never tried it."}
{"text":"All I can say is \"Wow!  Ribs are SUPPOSED to have meat on them!\"  Let me explain that.  I have tried ribs at other BBQ joints before, and every time I did I wound up getting one bite, maybe two, and leaving the rest rather disappointed.  So when I saw the combo at 521 I thought, \"What the heck.  Let's try ONE MORE TIME and see if this place is any different.\"  The ribs looked like THICK pork chops!  I made a meal off two of the ribs alone!  They were so tasty, and by the time I was finished with just HALF of them, I had to take the rest of the combo plate home with me!  We've never gone into this place where the staff wasn't just the most courteous and friendly people you could meet, and I'm digging the vinegar-based sauce; a good \"Eastern Carolina\" sauce is always a plus for me.  And my very picky son could eat the hush puppies all by themselves, though he does like a little BBQ thrown in for good measure!  Can't go wrong with this place!"}
{"text":"The best BBQ in North Carolina. Tons of food for your money and consistently awesome. Homey atmosphere just how a good BBQ joint should be. Everything is amazing if you even attempt Shane's rib shack or another location you're crazy."}
{"text":"When we want good bbq, we drive to Lexington, NC.  But we don't always have 3 hours to devote to a meal, so when we want bbq that's passable, we go to 521 BBQ.  I recommend a chopped bbq sandwich with white slaw on a bun with their sweet bbq sauce along with some fries or baked beans.  Don't try to go all out and get something amazing here, just stick to the basics and you'll leave satisfied.  And be warned:  the vinegar based bbq sauce has Franks Red Hot in it - it's WAY hotter than you're expecting it to be."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with this bbq place at all. Pork bbq had a weird flavor, as did the grilled chicken. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"4 stars for the service!!! Dory was extremely attentive and helpful.   The ribs were good too."}
{"text":"Good ol' down and country BBQ. The portions are insane and fitting for the south. You'll probably be able to make 2 meals out of one. Solid prices too!"}
{"text":"Living less than a minute away, I have only made it by 521 two times since they opened. But, they sure do serve some good 'Que.  They don't short you in the amount of food they give you either and for a pretty good price! I think it's smart (if you don't eat a lot) to get the two meat plate or tray [depending on the number of sides you want] and it will end up being two meals. That's what I did, as you see pictured, I doubled up on the chopped pork. The second half was taken to work for lunch the next day.  Though I didn't care for the green beans, the overall plate was tasty! The QuietDogs, as a complimentary muncher, were a nice fried treat! QuietDogs, you ask? Yeah ... HushPuppies! You're welcome. :)  Check for the Daily Specials too! Wednesday was $3 craft beer night. Nice! They offer a different special everyday, well except for Monday - they are CLOSED!  They ain't wingin' it here: I do have to say they have the BEST (non breaded) wings I have ever eaten in the Charlotte area! I ate one off a friends plate.. WOW! I should've ordered the wings. I guess I'll have to return..."}
{"text":"Great food and the staff is very nice. I've had the ribs and pulled pork. The ribs are huge with lots of meat on each rip. The place stays crowded so I would recommend going early or expecting a little wait."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ, great service, awesome prices. Had the rib plate and the ribs were perfect. Had a side of collared greens, also very good. I just came back from Kansas City, and the KC BBQ couldn't hold a candle to this. And right here!"}
{"text":"Good brisket on Thursdays only.  Great place to stop for a beer. Bar staff is great and owner keeps some good craft beer on tap."}
{"text":"I think it's the best BBQ in Fort Mill.  True slow smoked flavor.  Great choice of well made sauces. Even mustard based for all you heretics (you have to ask for it).  The lunch specials are a good value.  Enough food to want to take a nap instead of going back to work. Get there by 11:45 most days for lunch. It gets crowded."}
{"text":"While visiting the area, we wanted to try some local BBQ and this place was praised by our hosts.   We stopped by for lunch (no frills) and ordered some local BBQ-pulled pork. The service was very slow, it took forever to get our food. When it finally arrived, the waitress was about to spill some coleslaw on someone in our party. The pulled pork  was just OK, didn't think it was anything great. The mustard sauce was decent. We got the combo plates - It comes with fries (almost like Ora Ida fries from the bag), baked beans (pretty bad) and coleslaw that they make themselves. They have 2 types of slaw to choose from, the regular one and some made with red cabbage, pickled. I chose the pickled one, it was so sour and spicy (I like spicy), but this tasted strange, so I stopped eating it. The regular slaw was just horrible, it tasted funny, gross, like I never had before, maybe it was a bed batch? Not impressed with this place at all."}
{"text":"Really great food and a pretty traditional BBQ joint ambience.  The wax cloth tablecloths are always a little sticky but the floors and plates etc are always clean and the servers are really nice."}
{"text":"This place is very popular and always busy during lunch. Their BBQ meats are delicious and better than you e imagined. Yes they're that good. The BBQ sandwich is large and filling while the brisket is chargrilled to perfection. If you like BBQ, you'll love this spot. Prices aren't cheap but they have great specials."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq and mustard based sauce. Hush puppies are also very delicious,  we usually get takeout here once every few weeks. Service inside can be hit or miss but it is definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"I don't know what to say other than I love this place!! The service is good and the food is exceptional! I've had a couple of different meats but the ribs are by far my favorite. Definitely my favorite barbecue place around and I can't get enough of it! The portions are large and the prices are fair! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Inviting, friendly place. Good sized room. Excellent service.  The good: Excellent free hush puppy starters. Great service Ribs: overall very tasty- good texture- nice chew, not over-done. Meaty baby backs with a flavorful glaze and finished on the grill. Nice bark but a little light on the smoke for my taste. Good selection of house sauces. Mac and cheese with a good layer of hearty cheese. Decent draft selection.  The bad: The pulled pork \"BBQ\" was inedible. Grey, dry, over-shredded and bland. ( and we were a very early dinner group at 4 p.m.) Not a single bit of brown bark in several plates. Really tasted like it was days old. This is supposed to be the signature dish in this state?  The brisket. Dry, tough and grey. Under seasoned. Cut with the grain. The French fries appeared to be frozen \"crinkle cut\" from any freezer section in town.  Sorry, but quite disappointing overall."}
{"text":"This place has the best ribs! I'm not a huge fan of ribs, but when I get them, this is my go-to place. The BBQ sauce is fantastic, sweet yet tangy.  I have had a variety of menu items, all of which have been wonderful. The mac & cheese is delicious and I recommend it as your side dish. The coleslaw here comes in two varieties, red or white. I love coleslaw but I am not a fan of either of their coleslaws here. The green beans are very flavorful.  The hush puppies are fine but they don't have enough onion in them for my likes.  While the food is great, the service is hit or miss. Most of the time the service is great but there have been occasions where I felt like I wasn't valued as a customer or felt rushed during my meal.  The take out experience is always accurate."}
{"text":"Great service that makes you feel like home and ribs that are out of this world. Baked beans and hush puppies are nothing to sneeze at either... If you're looking to induce a delicious food coma this is your spot."}
{"text":"I selected this location based on my desire for a good pulled pork sandwich. I ordered the large bar-b-que sandwich (to go) and was pleased with the portion size.  The sandwich comes.with a small side of either red or white coleslaw. I had the white slaw on the side vs on top of the sandwich. I also chose the vinegar based sauce. The coleslaw had a very distinct mayo flavor, not bad or good..just different.  The sandwich comes with no sauce and you can add your favorite. The sandwich was hearty but it lacked  smoked flavor.  Other sides like fries  etc can be added as you like. I'll very likely try this location again and venture deeper into the menu."}
{"text":"521 bbq has to have one of the best smoked , bone in chicken breast I've had in the Carolina's . It was super moist , packed with flavor , and the sides were equally delicious .   Do we have one of these in Charlotte, NC? YUM   The collards were seasoned just like my grandmother made them , the green beans were fresh and not soggy , the potato salad was tiny in portion but it tasted exceptional too .   No one at our table had any complaints , everyone was too busy licking their fingers in between each bite ."}
{"text":"BBQ, and Ribs are fantastic. They are always quick and courteous! Suprisingly they have a great beer selection and some type of daily drink special. I eat here everytime I am in the area."}
{"text":"The ribs were meaty, fall off the bone fantastic and the beans were great, and the onion rings were tender inside and crisp outside - yummy.  The pups were okay.  The white slaw was blah....    I happened to visit on a day when they were short staffed in the kitchen, and the wait for our food was extremely long.   The waitress was very apologetic about the delay.  A man, who I assume was the manager, came over to apologize for the wait and informed us he was taking 25% off the bill.   The delay is the only reason 521 did not receive 5 stars.  Hopefully on my next visit I can upgrade them to a 5."}
{"text":"Good BBQ place. I ordered the beef brisket sandwich and it was delicious. Cooked to perfection. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant three times. The first time was absolutely amazing, ribs were tender and perfectly seasoned, fries (crinkle cut), my fav, and the hush puppies were divine. The entire meal left me excited about our next visit. However, our second visit the ribs were tough and fatty, French fries cold but the hush puppies were still great. We returned for a third visit hoping it was just a bad night. We had a combination of barbecue and ribs...the ribs were once again tough, fries were over cooked and my beloved hush puppies were cold. The service was perfect our first visit but went to pot on the other visits. I sure hope they get it together."}
{"text":"Don't expect anything special in the side items, breads, etc.  521 is known for three things - pulled pork, baby-back ribs, and vinegar based sauce.   BEST RIBS IN GREATER CHARLOTTE.  NUFF SAID."}
{"text":"I was under the impression that I had tasted good BBQ before. I was sorely mistaken. 521 BBQ has changed my view on BBQ forever!   It was AMAZING.   I enjoyed every bite of their tender, fall-off-the-bone ribs. They were seasoned and sauced so well, that I found myself lost in its spectacular flavor. Even the sides were delicious. Their mac and cheese, fries, and hush puppies were perfection. My only lament was that I could not finish it all! That's not a bad thing by any means. I was able to have the rest for lunch the following day, and it was just as good as the night before.   If you are ever in the Indian Land/Fort Mill area, DO NOT let this place slip through your fingers. Pull over and experience real BBQ. I mean...even the sweet tea was amazing."}
{"text":"Might be nice if they updated their hours posted on Yelp. It says they are open Mondays, but when we arrived they were closed. Guess we'll be eating BBQ elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had a pork sandwich & fries.  Pork was very good, moist, and tasty - almost as good as Shane's.  Negatives - french fries are pre-cooked then frozen - crummy.  Part of the seating area is right next to takeout area & wait station - crammed & noisy."}
{"text":"The Ribs could probably be the best I've ever had. I find myself making weird noises when I eat them. lol. Not really but they are wonderful.  The BBQ sauces are really good too. I mix the 2 sauces for a sweet & spicy taste.  It's really good with the pulled pork or to dip the fries in.  The kids menu is pretty pricey & it don't include their drink. The drink is an additional $2 charge. This is way I gave it only 4 Stars.  All in all, I strongly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Tasty pork barbecue. Large portions at a reasonable price. Be prepared to take some home. Great smoky taste in the pork and original sauce tasty.  Have been here twice and will return again and again."}
{"text":"If you like BBQ, I suggest you come on down the road to 521BBQ! These people don't even make hush puppies. I'm calling them heaven dogs. They were amazing! The crunch on the exterior and the moistness inside was crazy. I loved that they had just the right amount of sweetness without going over.  The fries were the crinkly kind and piping hot. I didn't even need salt, so that was a pleasant surprise!  The BBQ itself had a great flavor. They offered a tomato based (sweet) and a vinegar based (spicy) sauce, conveniently placed on the tables. I prefer both, so I mixed them together and they go very well, if that's your thing, too.  I even added a little Frank's that they also had out there because some like it hot and whatevs.  The beer was good and cold, the service was great (Haley and another awesome lady whose name I didn't catch were the only ones there and they still took time to interact with customers without keeping people waiting) and the restroom was clean.  I'm so glad we came through here and the next time I'm in the area, I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I have tasted since moving to the Fort Mill-Charlotte area... They provide their own special BBQ, which is delicious, and they also offer the vinegar base BBQ which I am accustom to being from Georgetown, SC. I will definitely visit again and again...  Price is not too bad.  Try the ribs plate!"}
{"text":"I read the past reviews and decided last night to try.  The chicken was okay. The ribs were disappointing. I'm use to fall off the bone ribs.  Maybe I'm spoiled to outrageous baby back ribs but the people who raved on the other reviews about the ribs must have bumped their heads or I went on a off night. I'll try them one more time and try pulled pork next time.  I gave three stars for service and cleanliness"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The ribs are the best you'll find in the area too.  Although 521 is a bit of a drive into \"the country\" from Charlotte, it is well worth the trip!  come with an empty stomach because the portions are big.  the atmosphere is laid back and the service is always great!  insider tip- they took the meat combo plate off the printed menu but if you want 2 types of meat,  plus fries and pups (without beans and slaw and the extra charge) they will still do it up for you!"}
{"text":"We've been to nearly all BBQ places around. And here's the scoop.  521 is the absolute best when it comes to ribs and cold beer. The best ribs around and I will not go anywhere else.  Jim and Nicks has the best BBQ in our opinion and Midwood Smokehouse has the best sausage links.  Stay completely away from City BBQ - terrible   521 is very consistent and overall, the staff is nice. The manager is a little on the non inviting side - but they are really busy.  The servers are very nice.  And if you like cold - I mean cold beer.  There is no where else to go."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today with my wife.  We haven't been here for a while, and always liked the wings.  Wife got the wings, fried squash and collards which were all good.  I got the chopped brisket sandwich and fries.  The brisket was so dry, and flavorless, it was pretty much inedible.  They should know better than to even serve something like that. Overall, everyone there was nice and friendly as usual, but the brisket was awful.  So go for the wings and skip the BBQ!"}
{"text":"So my family and I used to love 521 bbq but ever since the change in ownership the quality of the food has declined severely. Before the ribs were covered in bbq sauce and were never burnt and my mother absolutely loved it. But now I guess they discovered peppercorn and they literally put it on EVERYTHING... huge disappointment. A majority of the ribs I got were burnt and were bitter because of it. EVEN THE GREEN BEANS had peppercorn on them. It has made all the food salty and undesireable. This place is around the corner from where I live and used to be my go to, but now i need to find a different bbq joint. I wish the old owners would come back and bring the quality back to what it was... So very disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Great barbecue!! I absolutely love the barbecue sandwich with sweet BBQ sauce, amazing! I love being able to go to the bar and ordering to go! I do think for a simple order of one small sandwich and fries meal, it does take some time to get your order. I went in one day, pretty dead inside, and took a good 10 minutes to get my small order. The meal price is on point though! 6 bucks for a sandwich and fries that fills me up, couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best BBQ ribs I've ever tasted, I was introduce by a friend back in early 2016 before I moved to Waxhaw, every time I would fly down here I would schedule enough time to eat here!  Now a bit of a regular that I live here, I highly, highly recommend you give them a try!  I always get the rib tray the portions are extremely satisfying, the food is tasty their ribs are tender, juicy, fall of the bone mouth watering taste!  Their burgers are amazing and their hush puppies now free as an appetizer served with whipped honey butter are to die for!"}
{"text":"Was glad to see this location open,  but I've still been going to the original spot on 521.  Finally got to this one.  My usual go to plates are the pulled pork or the smoked wings.  I got the pork and a sweet tea.    The pork was well smoked and moist.  I added a bit of the vinegar sauce but not much. Really good plate and filling.  My wife thinks the hush puppies are the best around.  Crispy and moist to go with the flavor.    After trying the fort mill area bbq, 521 is hands down the best.  I prefer the smoking pig in rock hill or Mac's in Charlotte, but both locations of 521 are right up there.  I'm hoping it doesn't go downhill like the bbq restaurant down the street, but I don't think that will happen.  It's been going well for several years now."}
{"text":"Years ago before moving to Charlotte, I lived in Dallas, TX and would fly out here several times a month for business. I worked in the Ballantyne area off Johnson Rd. (512). The original 521 BBQ was my first exposure to Carolina Style BBQ and set the bar very, very high. To my excitement, we found after moving out here that there is now a satellite location in Fort Mill much closer to our house!  This is your traditional BBQ joint. The Fort Mill location is a little more upscale than the original by offering a great selection of beers with a couple rotating local craft offerings.  While I have tried a large cross section of their menu, my \"GO TO\" meal is their 2 Item Combo Plate with Ribs and Sausage. Lord help me, their sausage is AMAZING! While some like fried, I encourage folks to also give their onion rings a go as well!  Also, while it's not provided on the tray of sauces they bring to the table when you order, be sure to ask for their Mustard BBQ sauce. You'll be happy you did!  In summary: BEST BBQ EVAR!!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ, probably the best in the Charlotte area (edited for Dave S.).  Since they smoke their pork for hours get there early on the weekends because they do run out."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ. Pulled pork is one of my favorites. Ribs are good but had some rough batches. Overall one of my favorite BBQ places around."}
{"text":"One of the best old school pulled pork sandwiches you can find. Sides are generally tastey as well, but stay away from hush puppies as they aren't good."}
{"text":"After listening a coworker brag about this place for a long time... And the truth is; I TRULY LOVED THIS PLACE!. Ordered a Ribs platter that included Hush puppies and  baked beans. It was a LOT of food!, and at a decent price too. Loved the service and even the place being crowded on a Saturday afternoon it was darn quick!. I don't know if I was just lucky but I am glad that it didn't took long before I looked like a caveman with BBQ sauce all over my face and fingers enjoying what could have been the BEST RIBS EVER!(so far)."}
{"text":"Great ribs that fall off the bone and fantastic pulled pork. I especially liked the sides and mustard sauce.  The friendly staff made our visit fantastic. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"521 BBQ in Tega Cay is my go-to for great BBQ in the Charlotte/Rock Hill Area. Love the ribs, wings, smoked sausage, BBQ Burger(available on Mondays), and Brisket(available on Thursdays). The owners and staff are always friendly and make an effort to get to know you.  Give 521 Tega Cay a shot and you'll be a regular before you know it!  Enjoy."}
{"text":"Spectacular BBQ, and amazing ribs!!! Their sauce is out of this world, their portion sizes are ample, and the service is so friendly. Every time we're out here, we visit and it's a definite highlight!"}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible ribs-maybe the best I've ever eaten. Service was incredible. If you are lucky enough to get Rebecca, you will have a great dining experience! Ribs pulled pork hush puppies onion rings excellent. I agree  with other reviewer's that the coleslaw is strange. We ordered white, and it was too thick and heavy. Dinner hour is a bit on the noisy side. Really really great place. Come here!"}
{"text":"You can't get any bbq this good anywhere else in NC besides Lexington and Raleigh.  Get the rib plate.  You won't be sad, $14 on your belly will hate you.  That's all I have to say, stupid app is making me type more than what's needed.  Blah blah blah blah"}
