{"text":"The food is amazing,BUT, the service sucks!! Ordered my food at 7:40pm didn't get it until 8:30pm.  What a joke.  Find somewhere else to order you pizza."}
{"text":"This place is so stupidly overpriced but I decided to finally try it the other day. 2 panzos was $18 and change, they came with a red sauce to dip that tasted like jarred spaghetti sauce. So last but not least I tried to say thank you when leaving and the young tall skinny girl working the counter just barely raised her hand and didnt even look at me, it was embarrassing. Oh and btw the \"pizza/panzo\" was nothing special and small"}
{"text":"I always come to Toninos when I want pizza or pasta. They have a wide variety of fresh toppings and the sauces they use are delicious. The people are friendly and theres always a good atmosphere inside. Prices is good as well."}
{"text":"This place is my local go-to for great pasta. The food is always fresh and taste good. One of the best things on their menu are their chicken wings, they are huge and very inexpensive compared to the competitors. Service is friendly but can get slow when busy, however I'd take waiting a little longer for great food that wasn't rushed."}
{"text":"Great spot with a nice mix of a little something for everyone on their menu. Can't say I've had a bad experience in the years I've been going. I have taken more of a liking to their refined options lately as opposed to the sandwiches and wings I grew up on. Toninos is all about providing delicious food and value to its customers."}
{"text":"Very good place, went the other day for a few sandwiches and left amazed. Hidden gem, will go back"}
{"text":"At this point I have eaten here quite a few times but have forgotten to write a review.  I usually like to post pictures when I review a place but everytime I eat Tonino's I dig right in and forget to take a picture.  So far all I have tried here is the pizza and the ponzos.  Now im Italian so ive had my fair share of pizza and living in Brampton we all know that finding an Italian pizza place is not very easy.  Tonino's lives up to its Italian name.  All ingredients are super fresh, pizza is baked to perfection and is super tasty.  I recently had a ponzo was HUGE and packed with toppings.  The menu at Tonino's is quite extensive so it will take me a while to try everything but I do plan to do that."}
{"text":"Great place for good Italian food. Actually very fast and friendly service. We ordered spaghetti with meat balls for our kids and got them in 5 minutes."}
{"text":"Really great food here, good for dine in, take out and they also do delivery. Also available on justeat. Service could use some improvement when dining in, but they're fairly friendly. I don't appreciate how when you ask for water they give you a bottle so they can get away with charging you extra. However the water and pop is reasonably priced (about 1.25) which makes you feel better about it. Also the menu prices differ from what they charge you for some items, the take out menus are more accurate. They should make an effort to fix the current menus or at least let people know about the price difference (most of the time it's about a 50 cent difference nothing too major). Another thing is that the menu says they serve desserts like tiramisu but the server told me they don't have any desserts there, I was pretty disappointed because I was looking forward to the tiramisu. Aside from all these small faults the saving grace is truly the food. The pastas are all delicious and the alfredo sauce is amazing. Pasta is cooked perfectly al dente. Sandwiches are also good here, and everything is priced incredibly well and reasonable. If their food wasn't so good I would've rated it less than a 4 star for sure."}
{"text":"Well here is a small place that makes ok food but are very lazy. Once again putting their own convenience over quality. I don't understand the ignorance in Italians that feel they need to put sauce on everything. SAUSAGE SANDWICH DOES NOT HAVE SUGO!!!  This is because they don't know how to keep them without drying up. It's a messy sandwich. What a shame. There are several places that make a good sausage sandwich this is not one of them.  Needless to say  my sandwich had one bite then straight in the trash. For pizza and quick meals they are ok. Prices are reasonable but I won't be going back. Can't handle stupid."}
{"text":"Their food is always delicious! I love ordering their pasta, the agnolotti in Alfredo sauce is my favourite, I have tried other pastas as well and I've never been disappointed! Another favourite is their panzerotti's, they're great! Their portion sizes are good. The only issues I've ever had is one of my food items not being ready on time but they always try to get it out to you as fast as they can which I appreciate. Whenever I go there's always people dining in and taking out, it's a very busy place. For the portion sizes the prices are good. I believe when it comes to food you get what you pay for. Overall I highly recommend eating there whether you dine in or take out!"}
{"text":"Service sucks!!! We ordered 1 hour ahead for 6 sandwiches. Ordered ahead to save time. I sent one of my staff to pick it up. When he arrived there is was not ready and he waited over 30 mins for 6 sandwiches. The food is great but the amount of time needed it NOT acceptable. Very disappointed with the service. The place was empty and we waited and waited."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Tonino's and I am glad I did. I've always been a fan of a good veal sanwhich but they are so pricey, everywhere you go. Tonino's does it right and at an affordable cost. So far I have tried their Veal sanwhich, Chicken sanwhich and Penne a la vodka with chicken. Everything tasted great. This is definitely being added to my roster of places to stop for a quick bite. I would give this place 5 stars if they were friendlier."}
{"text":"This is a solid 2 star rating.  I've been to Tony and Jims also located in Brampton. I'm not sure if these two places were together before then went their own ways but the menus are almost the same.   I've been here several times and these are my observations....  I had a pizza slice a couple times and I found it to be good so one day I ordered a full size thin crust. There was just too much cheese on the pizza and it was dense and the crust was off.  I love wings and they have the same jumbo size wings at Tony & Jim's but they don't compare and here is why. Their pound of jumbo wings has 7 whereas T&J have 8.   About 45 minutes for wings, 45 MINUTES!!!! I once ordered a pound and if not mistaken I watched Family Feud on their tv and a good amount of ctv news. The place wasn't that busy so i don't know what wrong. \"Sorry for the wait\" is what I was told when I got them. The sauce on the wings? it's good but their suicide? Again T&J beats them.  From my experience the people there have been friendly.  As negative as some of my review sounds, I haven't written off this place as I would like to try their other dishes before that happens. (just don't order the wings there)"}
{"text":"Veal sandwich is great!  Personally I like thinner slices of meat and they nailed it!  Bread is good, sauce is good, definitely the best in Brampton, and well worth the drive. You'll thank me later :)"}
