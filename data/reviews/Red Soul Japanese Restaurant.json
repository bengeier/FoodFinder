{"text":"AYCE Review: It's OK.

Sushi: ordered salmon, white tuna and mackerel
Suuuuper thin slices of fish on a lot of rice.  Taste wasn't bad but I've never seen slices so thin. 

Rolls: much better than the nigiri.  They make good salmon avocado rolls. 

Appetizers: probably best thing you can get.  

They refilled drinks promptly.

Not a bad place to grab a quick meal."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch and enjoy the quality and value of the lunch specials. They have good Japanese and Thai dishes at a good price. The staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for delivery. Food came stone cold. Salmon was paper thin and short ribs were dry and pure fat could not eat it."}
{"text":"Long wait time for food 20 min to get a chicken wing first item. 1 chef 2 waitress. They seem to serve people of aisan ethic before all others. I walked out"}
{"text":"Food- For an All You Can Eat it wasn't that bad but it could be better. If you are looking to bulk then this place is the place to go. 

Ambiance- Modern looking and clean.

Service- The service was good but the place uses the pencil and paper method of ordering.

Value- Pretty average for an All You Can Eat."}
{"text":"New place opened across from York University. Overall, needs improvement.

*Miso soup had to be asked for several times.  Once served, it was cold!
*Only AYCE sushi place that serves green salad without dressing
*Shrimps were not cleaned (no matter what we ordered, rolls, tempura, skewers) 
*Many items not brought
*rice had a little too much vinegar for my liking

Sadly, nothing really stood out as my favourite"}
{"text":"2 stars for the food for sure because it is super decent and may be below average. 
I came for AYCE and another time for bento box during lunch time. It rarely gets busy I believe. All the foods is quite below average, to be honest.
My bento box was served cold as they made the meat before making rice. The server was nice enough to ask if I wanted to warm it up. I came early when they just opened so she cooked and served. The short ribs bento is $9.99 while the salmon is $8.99. For that price, I could somehow expect the quality.   Each bento box includes rice, meat, vegetable tempura, gyoza, salmon roll, salad, and soup. It is a place that I would go for lunch pricewise and portionwise.
AYCE is nothing special as it has regular items you can get at other AYCE place. I would recommend to go for a la carte instead since majority of AYCE items is super decent. 

Overall, I would come back but just for lunch bento box only."}
