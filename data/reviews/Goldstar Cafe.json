{"text":"This is one of my favourite place in Oakville downtown to escape from daily work routine and free up your mind. Such a beautiful interior and decor. Lot of space i would say lot of different spots to fit your mood. For 1 person or group or just 2 person. Not to forget about drinks, provide wide varieties of Espresso and tea.
I recommend one should at least visit this place once and i am sure you will come here again and again."}
{"text":"Just found this cafe last night. Amazing vegan and gluten free options, delicious coffee. Comfy seats. Nice staff. Stayed and did work for 2 hours. I will be heading back soon. Super impressed with this place."}
{"text":"Well it seems they are having a better run than the previous Marilyn Monroe incarnation, but this place is still super expensive given its location. Nice spot to drop by if you want a little snack or a sandwich with a hot drink. Nice decor on a few different levels and comfy chairs if you wanted to stay a while and read a book. If I was a rich kid, I'd probably eschew this place and go to the other place down the road."}
{"text":"Good coffee, nice ambiance, patio open for summer and fall periods. The carrot cake we ordered was weird tasting though."}
{"text":"Coffee is very very thin. Panini taste very normal. Cheese cake like rubber. Surprisingly with an interior design like this, the food and drink doesn't match at all.... what a shame...One star only because of the design."}
{"text":"Despite having gotten my sandwich order wrong, the Goldstar Cafe is a great place to stop in Oakville.

I stumbled across Goldstar while taking my dog for a walk. Although there are plenty of patios to enjoy, Goldstar was one of the only ones that had a doggy bowl for my pup.

I ordered a matcha latte and a sandwich and was able to enjoy it while giving my dog a rest. 

Would definitely recommend checking this place out mid-walk :)"}
{"text":"I came here a few months ago.  It's a very spacious coffee shop with two levels.  You can sit down at the tables or people watch and we ordered a latte and a latte with almond milk.  

Service was quite friendly.  Only thing is, there were quite a few tables that still had lots of plates on them and not cleaned, so this could be improved.  

Verdict: Good Indie coffee shop, but needs to be kept cleaner, especially with all the white tables."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Their staff is friendly and helpful.  I'm in love with the decor and just the overall environment.  I booked the upstairs for a networking event for Women Entrepreneurs and it worked great, because we had the private space, wifi and great coffee/lattes! 

Will definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Nice place to catch up with a friend for coffee. Has the downtown feel in Oakville"}
{"text":"Another new hot spot in down-town Oakville! (Mississauga please take note, we need more cafes like this!). Again, I saw this place while on a run and knew I had to check it out, so the following weekend that is exactly what we did. We came an hour to close and it was still fairly busy. The inside is very white and light, with an artsy vibe going on (black and white photos), really great seating, the booths even have decorative pillows. They have lots of vegan and some GF options snack-wise which is always appreciated. 
The menu is very enticing, I would like to come back for lunch one day. I got a raspberry truffle latte and my other half got a cinnamon dolce. They were both really good (I liked mine better :-P) and we got a croissant to share which was also good quality, but their drinks were better.
As I said I would come back here. They have two floors and I have yet to explore the upstairs. The staff is also very friendly and they have a loyalty stamp card (always a plus)."}
{"text":"It's so elegant,  love the coffee and the Italian soda !!! I'll be back for sure! Great price 2!"}
{"text":"Always count on great service and tasty coffee or tea! The location is my favourite \"to-go\" coffee shop in DTO, as the cozy atmosphere makes it half the fun for a coffee date, either with girlfriends, kids or family. We love the raspberry scones, cappuccino, loose leaf tea and vegan cookies!"}
{"text":"What an attractive, cozy, cafe! It has the feel of a slightly upscale coffee shop, but still with a very casual atmosphere. We found this place by chance when searching for a snack spot in the area, and were quite impressed. 

First, parking. There's lots of street parking on Lakeshore Road, and some residential streets south of Lakeshore have parking free after 6:00 PM (where we parked).

Second, the ambiance. Gray, light blue, violet colour scheme. Very comfortable booths, decent sized tables, booths carefully decorated with soft pillows. Very clean. An upstairs seating area filled with more tables and comfy seats. Paintings line the walls indicating price (around $300 - not sure if these are for sale, but the price is there nonetheless). Staff are very sweet. It's an environment you can definitely do some work in (not too noisy) or to have a chat with a friend - there's lots of space, with a definite air of sophistication, but still super comfortable.

Third, the food and drink. They have many vegan and gluten-free options. We had a hot chocolate and a coffee toffee chocolate chip cookie (vegan!) and they were both delicious. Not too sweet and oozing with chocolate. No complaints there.

I paid around $7.00 for the drink and cookie. A bit pricey, but taking everything together, including environment, I'd definitely come back here when I'm in the area. A very pleasant experience!"}
{"text":"Great place, beautiful seating area, just don't buy their smoothies. They're horrible"}
{"text":"Love this place. The place is nice and clean. Staffs are friendly and welcoming. Coffee and food are yum. ohhh and the coffee arts are cute. Will def come back."}
{"text":"Very nice place for big groups, also good to study in quiet. They unfortunately don't serve breakfast other than some cookies and croissants but their coffee is really good."}
{"text":"The interior design and mcm furnishings brought me here.  It's elegant, bright, & airy!

I stopped in with a friend to catch up with drinks and a quick bite.  Most, if not all, of the goodies in the glass case were labeled \"gluten free\", \"organic\", etc.  I don't know why I was surprised 'cause I was in Oakville after all.

I wanted to order one of their salads, but they ran out in the mid-afternoon.

I had some kinda Matcha Smoothie which I found just ok.  Matcha flavour wasn't very strong and I thought that it would be thicker.  

Baked goods on the other hand were really good!  Both the blueberry (or cranberry) scone and the smoked salmon and brie sandwich (open face) were really good!  Bread was very soft and scone was just the right consistency - not too hard or dry.  ~$20 for 2 drinks, 1 scone, 1 sandwich, so not a cheap place.

Upper floor was closed off for \"reservations\", so I couldn't enjoy the view from up there.  I found service just alright.  Not overly friendly or making suggestions.

Overall, I felt as though the atmosphere hyped up the place for me.  Would go back, but not making any immediate plans."}
{"text":"I visited Goldstar with my wife on Saturday October 21 to get a little work done. We are frequent visitors to downtown Oakville and decided to differ our regular coffee shops and try a new place especially since we love to support local businesses and we always pass by Goldstar but never go in
. 
Positives: The layout and decor of the coffee shop is very nice. It is very open and there are some nice booths you can do your work in or gather with friends for a chat. I really like the white decor which is a nice refreshing feel to other coffee shops in the area. The washrooms are more high tech than most places with top-of-the-line hand dryers, toilet sensors and fixtures.

Odds and ends: I found service to be relatively slow considering we only ordered 2 coffees it took a while to get out. Other people ordered simple items like danishes and it took equally as long. Secondly there was no music playing. The cafe felt oddly quiet which I didn't mind but you would expect so ambient music in the background. Signage to the upstairs kinda indicated the top level was closed for reservations but it really wasn't. The sign was just placed at an odd angle and the staff didn't think it was a big deal.

Negatives: There are a lot. The furniture in all the booths were worn out. The leather had holes and tears. The tables were not clean and my wife has to clean it and wipe it down ourselves. The floor around our booth was also very disgusting with coffee spills and stains. My wife had to leave to go for a walk because the stagnant air was bothering her and giving her a headache. I wasn't bothered so much. I went to use the washroom and upon using the hand dryer I could see it hadn't been cleaned in a while because of all the moist lint and mildew that had formed at the base of the dryer and hadn't been cleaned in a few weeks at least. 

There seems to be a lack of care for the cafe by staff which is sad because you can see how much attention the owner must have put into the look and design. With so much competition in the area they need to step up if they look to stand out and build a loyal clientele. 

Not sure if I'd give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"Attractive, bright, cozy seats, fresh looking and cleanest place I've been to! I absolutely love the interior and the staff was absolutely friendly.  Dark mocha was absolutely tasty and I am so.down to try the food there!"}
{"text":"This is my new favourite place to go for coffee in Oakville.  The coffee is well brewed, tea is served in a press and the latte is smooth and rich.  Tonight I got a salted caramel macaron with my latte.  The sandwiches look delish!"}
{"text":"We meet here weekly to Knit or. ... Knot. 

Lovely place. Great treats, great service."}
