{"text":"Fantastic pub food, exceptional burger and terrific nachos, coupled with amazing waitstaff equals a great effen time.  Thank you for making my bday one to remember.  see u soon"}
{"text":"Cams place is definitely my favourite bar! Its low prices and awesome service make it so great. The first time I went alone I was welcomed by the super friendly, super funny bartender (Doug), who engaged me in conversations and definitetly made me feel not only welcomed, but like I wasnt there alone. Ever since, ive continued to go in, and have never experienced less than amazing service! All the bartenders are great! My favourites are Doug and Matt! Go in, get a beer, and have a good time! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for ages, but only once a month or two. I would have always given it 3 stars due to shoddy management and totally uninterested staff. Great location and cool little upstairs with good beers but the staff had checked out. Dropped by recently and it's under a new manager who is genuinely enthusiastic about changing the bar to bring in better staff and food. $2.00 tacos on Tuesday - screamingly good deal. I'd say try it again in the next few months all the burnt out staff seems to be gone."}
{"text":"I was shocked to pay $36 for 2 SMALL salads, both  with a meagre portion of chicken. I work in fine dining in the financial district and my place is $4 cheaper for the same items. We also have linen on the tables. The server didn't explain the jump in price, and the cramped space smelled of old beer. Food was average - service average. Pricing ridiculous. Don't bother."}
{"text":"Fan of this pub, although the food is a bit hit and miss. It's currently closed with a sign in the door saying new owners and closed for renovations but there's been absolutely no activity for nearly two months now so I have my doubts about that."}
{"text":"Nice little pub in North Toronto with an upscale menu mixed with standard pub fare. I had the vegetable quesadillas which were tasty and reasonably priced. Service was good. Nice open front area but alittle dark inside in the pub. Seating areas felt more like park bench style than comfortable tables. I'd go back though."}
{"text":"So have to update, as this bar became the go-to place when we wanted after work pints and it's really grown on me. The mac & cheese is fantastic, and the sweet potatoes fries are still a favorite. The menu isn't very veg friendly, but my carnivorous partner loves to eat here, so maybe my previous review was just too biased? Either way, would have to change my recommendation to a strong 'check it out,' the staff is awesome, the regulars are super friendly and have no qualms with chatting with anyone who comes along, and the live music they had last time was really good."}
{"text":"In a desert full of obnoxiously upscale restaurants and bars, Cam's Place is an oasis. The seating is perfect (basically all booths), the service is friendly and it just has this chilled out vibe that I love. My friend and I sat at the very front booth, right beside the garage door that they opened to let in the sunshine. Perfect.   We ordered some sweet potato fries and they may be the best I've ever had. They were kind of rectangular shaped, so they were perfectly crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside.   We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for Brunch (they serve it til 4pm) after a relaxing few hours at the Iyashi Bedrock Spa across the street. After spending a lot of time on Yelp, trying to find a good place to have lunch in the area, this was all that came up.   I was pleased at the late brunch, and I got a large cup of coffee (slightly burnt), and the Eggs Florentine ($9) with a side of Bacon ($3). Prices are good, and portion sizes okay.   The Eggs, came on a tiny croissant under a bed of too salty spinach. The poached egg was runny, so if you don't like it this way, ensure it's medium. The homefries were super crunchy and I liked them.   The girl working at the bar was friendly and joked around, but the guy that was helping her seemed really out of it. I asked for the bill and he thought I was asking for milk, multiple times, unless I yelled out CHECK.  Also some milk (actual milk) droplets were on my table the whole time, and no one noticed or wiped it.   It's small, and lots of neighbourhood people here at 12pm."}
{"text":"Nice quaint atmosphere, only room for 20 odd people approximately. The service is great and a crowd of regulars make Cam's a great neighborhood pub to share a pint among friends. I haven't had much of the food, but I'm told the daily specials are always good."}
{"text":"I upped my rating from a 3 to a 4 star purely based on their pulled pork nachos - which you can get for $5 on either Saturday or Sunday. They are sooooooooooooooooooo good!!! Other than that, this is just your average drinking hole. Depending on who's working the bar, you can also get a pretty decent Bourbon Sour as well."}
{"text":"Been living in the area for 6 years but never checked this place out. Glad I finally did!    The 2nd Anniversary comedy show was really funny. Special props to Fraser Young for being so hilarious. anyone griping about this place on a comedy night - good luck finding any other comedy place in Toronto where they are unpretentious, you can order decently priced food and where you can get a free glass of tap water! Apparently this is forbidden at any actual \"Comedy club\" spaces. So lame - and the reason why this is my new fave spot. I'll drink more beer if I can keep my hangover at bay with the occassional glass of water and some good food - thanks!  For the food:  My boyfriend's fish and chips were really good ($9 Friday special) - and I'm picky about fish. Sadly, my cajun chicken wrap ($8) left a bit to be desired. But my buddy liked his wings ($11). And I was loving the gravy and fries. I think this is a spot where you gotta go fatty and fried or go home!  I definitely want to come back and try one of their giant, juicy, tempting burgers next time. Last Friday of every month, I'll be back for the comedy and great food! The beer was also a great price ($5 for Mill st organic - my fave)!  Service: Was a bit slow, but the bartender was stuck doing the entire upstairs alone - including food, table service and at-bar service, so I couldn't balme her. She kept a bright, sunny and friendly disposition.   Only one tip: Would love to see them fix their website and have an updated event calendar."}
{"text":"This place is a little gem amongst the high-rolling restaurants around the Yonge and Eglington area. It's a little north of the main intersection, but well worth the trek. The place was nice a cozy, but still polished and uncluttered. To be perfectly honest, I was not expecting much of the food there, but my dinning companion didn't want to walk anymore to find a different place. I was intrigued by the daily special, a cubano sandiwch. Let's say I was pleasantly surprised that we stopped at Cam's place for a quick meal.   The cubano was full of juicy and tender roast pork, plenty of pickles (and more on the side too!) and lots of melted swiss cheese. The sandwich was so huge, I had half of it for dinner the next day. Being the holiday season, I decided to indulge and go for the fries, which ended up being a wise choice. They were slightly thicker than shoe-string sized and very crisp. I tried some of the caesar salad that came with my friend's meal and it was your run of the mill, trusty caesar. It was nothing to write home about (but I guess I'm doing that here), but sometimes you just need romaine lettuce covered in creamy dressing with bacon (real bacon too!) and croutons.    If I'm ever in that area of town again, I would definitely drop into Cam's. They have specials each day, including what looked like a delicious fish and chips dinner. From the quality of the chips, I would think the fish would be wonderful too."}
{"text":"As a former Sporting Life employee, I have stumbled out of Cam's Place (and, as it was previously known, Mad Monty's) on more than one occasion, wondering where a good part of my paycheque went.   I don't know if a bar close to a student university job can count as a \"local\", but ever since those days, I've always considered Cam's Place to be my local.   The drinks are cold, the staff is friendly, and the food is surprisingly good.   A scratch-made weekend brunch is everything your poor hangover could ask for, although you're better off with chips than home fries, which can be a bit overdone; and eggs over easy instead of over-done when scrambled. Fat sausages and buttered toast clog arteries but soak up last night's bender.   Burgers hail from a time before the Priest; thick parties crusty from the grill, old school veggies and a slick of molten cheese. Sided with house-cut fries, it's tough to finish within an alotted lunch break.   Nachos are suitably evil; share them because you have to, lest you be perceived a glutton.   Coffee is an afterthought, but it's brewed hot and refilled with a smile.   Is this an unbiased review? No. Is it based on fully conscious memories? Also no. But I'll stand by it. Cam's Place is my place."}
{"text":"i forget which day i was here but it was the day of the week for some ribs.. i don't usually eat ribs, but i will probably be back for some more!! it's pretty cool how theres different specials every day of the week. i don't remember it being so crowded around the afternoon, but service was sort of slow. there was only one worker, and he was at the bar most of the time. i sat next to the kitchen so the cook had our food ready, but it wasn't served until another 5 minutes or so bc the worker was too busy with something else. good food though, i recommend cam's place if you plan on trying it"}
{"text":"NEW OWNERS-NEW MENU 2013 I've been in here a handful of times and every single one I've had to look around like a big dope wondering who in this tiny bar could possibly be the server. This place is filled with regulars who like to scream on the street at 3am and you can hardly distinguish the staff from the patrons because they will ignore customers until you stand up to leave. I mean I walked right by the server/bartender when I walked in and he didn't greet me or tell me he would be a few minutes because he was having the best conversation with his dear friend which I would have been absolutely fine with. Truth is time after time service sucks but I went for the delicious food which is now lacking with the new owners so... obviously don't come here unless you're feeling like being ignored while eating below mediocre food."}
