{"text":"Well after reading all the reviews I decided to get the place a shot. Well boy was I impressed the food was amazing staff was friendly and I will be back"}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant on Saturday for dinner.  It was busy.  Food was good.  Just beware of the suggested specials which is recommended by the server.  Ask for the price.  On the menu the mains are reasonable e.g. lamb shank is $25.95.  From the specials the veal chop was $37.95 and halibut was $37.95.  For 4 of us we wanted to share the calamari as a starter and the server suggested we order a main dish which we did but the portion was not the greatest.  We gave our feedback to John, the manager the following day and he confirmed that all the servers would inform the clients of the prices of the specials on a go forward and he hoped we would give them another chance."}
{"text":"Nice neighbourhood restaurant that maintains its standards. Food is good but not great.  Recommendations: muscles to start salmon for main spinach salad"}
{"text":"Came on Valentine's Day for lunch. Would rather have lunch out than dinner on this night. My husband and I both ordered Caesar salad and pizzas. The salad was fresh, with a beautiful oil and vinegar dressings vs a thick creamy dressing. I prefer the made in front of you Caesar and this was just as good. Nice bacon with hardened Parmesan chips. I do however prefer slices of fresh Parmesean. I could taste some anchovies in the dressing which is right up my alley.  The pizza is thin crust, very tasty and made a believer out of my husband. I made my own pizza toppings and the spicy sausage was really good. Sliced like pepperoni and all toppings plentiful. My husband had the meat based pizza, sorry I forget the name they call it on the menu. Really great tasting pizza and crust done perfectly.  I have been here twice, the first time in the summer with my kids when we sat on the patio. I enjoyed a pasta with seafood and if I remember I  asked for a white wine, garlic sauce vs a red sauce. They were happy to oblige. I love garlic and it didn't disappoint. My kids all enjoyed their pizza and pastas.  A small place with a nice vibe. Planning a return engagement as the pizza left us wanting it again.  Enjoy !!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant - warm atmosphere and always friendly staff. The menu is delicious and very upscale - love the lattes"}
{"text":"Service:  7/10 - Perhaps because we didn't make reservation - It appears they have their usual Friday night crowd - Lots of elderly (appears to be their regular customers)  Food:  7.5/10 - pappardelle + braised beef short rib (hubby say too much wine) but I love the pappardelle - servered hot/fresh  - mussels - nice tomato sauce with a spicy kick  - braised lamb shrink - was ok   - banana bread pudding was good  - tiramisu not great  Score:  72"}
{"text":"Great local place for lunch and dinner.  Their pizzas are some of the best that I have ever had.  The crust is fantastic and the toppings are generous.  The caesar salad is very good with their dressing more on the light refreshing side as opposed to the traditional heavy creamy type.  The desserts are also very tasty.  I like the pizzas here so much that I have not ventured to try any of their other mains."}
{"text":"AWFUL food and TERRIBLE service.  I ordered from the lunch menu  'ROASTED\"  half chicken with grilled vegetables and honey pan jus @ $17.95. What  I received a piece of breaded chicken that was pan fried and GREASY served over a pile of gelatinous muck that was from the DINNER menu that the server said was EXACTLY the same as the lunch menu. Ah NO!! the 'ROASTED' half chicken on the dinner menu is served over what they call Fragola pasta and dried cherry grappa jus @ $19.95. It was overpriced garbage. They might as well cook their garbage. The female server was rude, abrasive, impatient and seemed to think it was appropriate to slam dishes down and shove things around on the table to make room for other dishes. She splashed me with water not once but twice. Further mid service when the restaurant phone rang she bolted to go answer it and then promptly yelled to someone in the back to take the call. She was so classy..... all third! I will NOT return."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner around 7pm with a friend.   SERVICE - Service was good. Was greeted quickly by a hostess when we walked in and seated right away with some ice water. The place was clean and had a dark ambiance. The restaurant was a bit small for a great italian place but was cozy and added to the environment. Our waiter was super friendly, giving us recommendations and the daily specials.   FOOD - I ordered lamb shank and my friend ordered a fettucine pasta and together we shared a thin crust pizza. The pizza was great. A nice thin crust topped with just the right amount of tomatoes and cheese. My lamb shank was tender and tasty. On the other hand, my friends pasta had chunks of lamb in it that seemed a tad too dry and tough. Then came dessert time. We ordered the banana bread pudding and it was fabulous. One of the best desserts I've had. Would definitely come back here just for the banana bread pudding. It was warm, soft, and served with vanilla and caramel sauce. Definitely 5/5 stars for the banana bread pudding.    We paid around $95 for three dishes, dessert and tip."}
{"text":"The waitress told my party of 7 to eat within an hour because we were sitting on an empty reserved table for a party that was coming in an hour or so. I didn't want to wait for another table opening when the restaurant was already full, so why the heck not.  I lack knowledge on the different cuts of pasta, so I randomly ordered the Pappardelle with  braised short ribs on top. The ribs were great- the meat practically fell off the bone and the flavour was inside. The pasta was difficult for me to eat because it was in such a thick ribbon and a dry feeling in my mouth. The tomato jus didn't really help the eating process either. Might as well eat plain pasta..."}
{"text":"We went there a couple of weeks ago and had a really plesant time. The atmosphere is relaxed, cozy and friendly. The seafood linguine is really good ... overall great experience."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night after reading so many reviews about this place.     As self proclaimed foodies, we dine out a lot, and it also takes a lot to wow us.  Having said that, the rating for this place is based on overall quality of food, service and experience for the price.     My bf and I ordered off the price fixed menu and our other friend got the beef rib pappardelle which she really enjoyed.    My spinach salad with fig and walnuts was ok.  Dressing was alright, figs were too sweet and tasted more like pieces of prunes than figs.  Bf got the tomato soup which he said tasted very fresh and was also ok, nothing amazing.  For mains I ordered the seafood linguine which I really liked. The sauce actually had seafood flavor and though the scallops were very small, the mussels shrimp and Calamari were cooked well.    My bf had the lamb shank which was cooked well.  Sauce was unremarkable, but very still pretty good for the price.  Our server was very friendly and though it took him a long time to take our order cause he thought we were waiting for another person to join us, he made up for it by giving our friend a free dessert.  Two of us had the tiramisu which was not amazing but still alright, and the bf had the bread pudding which he said was decent.  We will be returning because of the amazing value for the quality of food and service rendered."}
{"text":"The food is good here.  Had the noccias and had rissotto .  My only complaint is wait ignored us and we were the only ones there! Hence i gave them only 3 stars."}
{"text":"I won't miss them the last meal I had there came with sliced plastic in my wife's appetizer.   When my entree arrived the potatoes were cold. Instead of warming the potatoes they choose to argue with me.  Nice !"}
{"text":"Best carpaccio appetizer in Canada. Menu limited but everything very good. Great service. Cozy environment. One of our favorite spots for two or four. Always happy to be there."}
{"text":"The first feeling that comes to me is this is a decent family restaurant. In a Sunday dinner there are a few tables with kids. The price is not expensive especially given the portion of the dishes. The environment is cozy and there are nit that many tables. It has been in the current location for a long time.   The Pappardelle pasta is good. The braised shirt ribs that come with the pasta taste very good.  If the ribs can be marinated for a longer period of time, it will be even better. The rack of Lamb is cooked just right medium rare. It is highly recommended.  The vege is a bit oily. The Tiramisu is one of the best in Toronto.  It is moist. You can tell the different texture layers of the cake. It is a big piece.   The server is very attentive.  He even gives us another loaf of bread when it runs out. Overall it is a very decent restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here on New Year's Eve dinner. Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated and our coats were taken from us. The small restaurant was nice and cozy, with dim lights and seemingly friendly staff. Unfortunately, the service seemed to be below par on a busy evening as such.  Only the prix fixe menu was offered. For appetizer, I ordered the baked crab cake. There was definitely plenty of crab in that cake! The delicious order was paired with a fresh salad. I was quite pleased with the appetizer.   For the main, I ordered the Roasted Atlantic Salmon with a Sea Salt and Thyme Crust. The salmon was ok; nothing to rave about and was a bit undercooked. The tomatoes sitting next to the salmon were also on the sour end.  Finally, the warm chocolate cake for dessert was nice. It wasn't as heavy as some of the others I've tried, which is a nice finish to the night.  Overall, the food was alright, aside from the main course which was a little disappointing. I wish there was better service because at times, we felt neglected."}
{"text":"Tonight the family ventured outside the usual boundaries of our Markham dining faves to experience all that Ferrovia Ristorante has to offer.  What a great Italian restaurant. Similar to Johnny Bistro (in Markham), this cozy space has friendly and knowledgeable staff, delicious wine, great ambience and last but not least, fantastic food.  There is a wide variety of salads, pizzas, pastas, meat, and seafood all prepared in a traditionally yummy but slightly adventurous way. The best part is the incredibly accommodating kitchen, willing to substitute, subtract and modify dishes in a variety of ways. We were able to custom order a number of main dishes without any trouble at all.  The specials were another amazing feature, I'm assuming it was not just this one Tuesday evening, but there were NUMEROUS specials that all sounded delectable.   it was a perfect family dining experience, but would also be great for a date, gathering or friends or even business dinner."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite Italian restaurant, and I'm surprised it's in a fairly hidden spot where you would never expect it!   I have never tried the prix fixe menu (which I noticed got a few of the 3 stars), but I would suggest trying the seafood linguine! The portions are excellent, the sauce is delicious, and lots of fresh seafood to go around.  Well worth it.  I've become a regular."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my brother, and the food is surprisingly delicious. The restaurant seemed to be pretty popular - and they've got a set course dinner menu Monday through Thursday. My food was good, the desserts were a bit plain, but the service was great and it was great to come to a non-stuffy sort of place to spend time with my brother. Definitely a good spot for a date night or nice small family meal!"}
{"text":"Heard some great things about the restaurant, but didn't want to get my hopes too high. Ended up being a nice meal but not somewhere I'd go again.  The restaurant itself was quite nice. Nice decor and ambiance, but the space was tiny. And when I say tiny, there wasn't even enough room for the servers and staff to walk around. They kept dropping things, bumping into others, and having to wait for others to pass while holding hot dishes. Not the smartest use of space, as they have too many tables, and definitely makes the space feel over-crowded.   I decided to go for the Rigatoni with Spicy Sausage, and it was pretty good. Nice depth and spice to the overall flavour, but nothing that blew me away.   The service was good, as the server came by to check up on us and fill up our waters. The hostess felt like she was rushing us out, as she brought over our bill before we asked for it, and moved quickly without being too pleasant. Didn't really like that towards the end of the meal.   Not a bad place if you're in that area, but definitely have had better Italian food for sure."}
{"text":"Overrated! I'm tired of overrated restaurants especially now that I choose restaurants base on Yelp reviews. I found that the staff was not that nice and I think that is one of the most important things! Service! Especially the lady that took us to our table. Seems like they are only nice to the \"regulars\", but I'm thinking if you are not nice to newcomers, how are you going to get regualrs?   Restaurant was small and dark. Old school flavour. The food was really meh to me. Well I ordered the spinach salad with figs and brie and it was alright, nothing special. Then I also order a Steamed PEI mussels in tomato wine sauce because it was a protein and veggie kind of night. First of all, these fat gross, pouchy-looking, mussels were not PEI mussels, some sort of farmed modified species. I hated it, and the sauce had no wine flavour in it at all, I don't know who they were trying to fool. Maybe their pasta was better but their pizza was not that great as well. So I don't know what is all the rave about, the a la carte menu... not that great."}
{"text":"Seabass $33 is amazingly soft melts in your mouth and the skin is crispy to finish it off, totally worth every penny :) banana pudding is yumyum!! Seafood risotto is 5 stars as well, very large portioned and had to take 2/3 of it homes: really surprised that it reheats pretty well!! Overall experience is definitely better than I expected!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome night of indulgence.  This rigatoni pasta was savory and aromatic.  The pasta was perfectly al-dente cooked to little hard and stick to my teeth.  The pasta was tossed with spicy Italian sausage, hot peppers and tomato sauce.  It gave a burst of spicy and hot flavour with every bite.  This by far my favourite rigatoni pasta.  Thanks @ferroviaristorante for the excellent service and great food.  I will definitely come back and try other goodies in the menu."}
{"text":"Dimly lit restaurant, it gives off a rustic Italian atmosphere.   We got the penne gnocchi in a cream sauce and braised short rib pasta. Both dishes were good portion size and filled us up. Food quality was decent, quite average I would have to say. The food came to us more lukewarm - felt like it was sitting on a warming centre for a while.   It's on the pricier side for a meal. Service was fast and friendly, though there was only 2 servers and they were running around a lot. I'll keep searching for my go-to Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. It was small and cozy, which I prefer over the big and crowded. The atmosphere was perfect, with dim lights but bright enough to see people's faces. We waited a while before we were served, so that wasn't very exciting for us. Our server came and was quick to apologize that she didn't realize we were there.  We ordered grilled calamari, seafood linguine and braised beef ribs with mashpotatos. The food was great and came really quick. The portion was decent, but could be slightly bigger for the price. Overall, a great place to take your significant other!  Another thing I'd like to mention is that they have a patio for outdoor dining. Unfortunately it was snowing, so we enjoyed our dinner inside.. :)  4.5 stars. I'd give it 5 if we were served promptly.. How could server have not seen my girlfriend and I sitting not even 5 ft away? Lol"}
{"text":"Love this place. Its our family's second kitchen. We know the staff welll, and enjoy their service. Food is well priced for the suburbs. Small cozy restaurant in Thornhill. Definitely a gem on its own. The owners are such great happy people, makes you feel like family. And I really enjoy the fact that they have a pre-fixed menu to order from. Makes it so much easier to know what you want."}
{"text":"Well I honestly say I expected much more from the restaurant. First of all, the atmposhpere is what you would expect from a restaurant with three stars. The waiters were just OK. I ordered caesar salad, ribs and for desert the molten chocolate. Caesar salad was EXACTLY what you expect from a NORMAL restaurant. The ribs were good in quality but the taste - another so so. And the dessert was NOT molten chocolate. It was more like a brownie or sth. And last but not least, the bill was an average bill. So expect nothing more and nothing less; this is an absolute average restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent food.  Nice atmosphere.  The pizza is quite ok. Pasta is so-so.  Overall it's a pretty good option for this area. Would probably come back if in area and looking for Italian.  P.S: They have a nice patio for summer!"}
{"text":"From start to finish, the Sun/Mon night Prix Fixe($23.95) does satisfy the neighbourhood couples or oldtime friends night out.  In a plaza that seems like a quiet oasis away from the youthful or money-chitchat, Ferrovia is a pleasant get-away from any pretentiousness.  I FIT right in, felt so comfortable that I almost wanted to doze off.  3.5'd  Bread slices with Hummus.  My opinion is the Bread had good character on it's own, I forego the Hummus which was pleasant as well btw.  Ferrovia Caesar, Shrimp Bisque, both simple satisfaction apps.  Seafood Linguine, Roast Salmon are done to requirements albeit parts of the Seafood being slight underdone.  Banana Bread Pudding perfectly proportion to curb any carb cravings, otherwise opt for their daily selection of Gelato.  My spot for that perfect hideaway in Markham/Thornhill to partake a calm Western meal without too many kids[1] around, or too much Z103.5 blasting my braincells into smithereens.  Let's keep this place a secret between you and me.  Deal?  [1] Anyone under 50, not actual children/teenagers."}
{"text":"I just had dinner there with a large group of people. We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the plate and all were very delicious and unique! We ordered the bruchetta, which had fresh tomatoes, the warm mushroom salad, as well as a spinach salad with figs.   As my entree I had the roasted half chicken which was lightly breaded and seared and super juicy. The jus was a sweet sort of juice which was amazing!   I would definitely recommend this restaurant and cant wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Ferrovia is a hidden gem in the area...As the plaza isn't really close to malls or whatever...just by itself with Longos and a few other small stores...It's easy to passby and miss it on Bayview...   It felt like a family ran business with quality food.. we ordered the warm mushroom salad with goat cheese and arugala, beef tenderloin carpaccio, grilled calamari...main course we ordered special of the day pasta and pizza.... and how can we miss dessert?! As per another guy friend, the banana bread pudding was better than sex....Wow!!   Everything was absolutely delicious...we bought our own wine and the corkage fee was $20...which was ok... we ended up ordering more wine... Lol...   The service was a little bit slow as there was only 2 servers...and they almost had a full house on a Tuesday evening....  All in all, it was a great experience!  Definitely coming back without a doubt..."}
{"text":"I went to Ferrovia and was surprised by the quality of food and small restaurant atmosphere. It felt like a small bistro that should be down town. The wait staff was really nice and service was quick.  To start, I ordered the bruschetta pizza. The tomatoes and toppings were very fresh and seasoned very well. Unfortunately, the \"pizza crust\" was a bit of a let down. It resembled grocery bought pita bread. I'm not too sure if the pizza is made with the same crust but on the bruschetta pizza, it was far too chewy and doughy for my liking. The taste offresh tomatoes, red onions, and spices were lost within the crust. Luckily there was a bread basket at the table so I created my own bruschetta with the tomato topping. The bread basket was fairly nice. The bread tasted fresh and was served with a side of zesty humus instead of butter.  For my main I had the Pappardelle with braised beef short ribs, cremini mushrooms and a tomato beef jus sauce. It was spectacular. The pasta was thick and al dente and the sauce coated each noodle perfectly. The braised beef short ribs were flavorful, juicy, and tender and the cremini mushrooms gave a nice finish to the dish. The portion was heaping! I was full once I finished half but the dish was so good I couldn't help myself from finishing. I was amazed by the quality of my meal and how authentic it tasted. I learned from the owner (I think his name was john, or jason?) later that the chef hails from Italy and has been with the establishment since day one. He tried to keep every dish as authentic as possible.  For dessert I had a creme brulee that didn't disappoint. Thick caramelized sugar topping with creamy centre. The centre was a bit cold but you could see and taste the fresh vanilla as it accompanied the thick cream on the inside.   Overall I was very surprised by this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone looking for good eats north of Toronto, actually to anyone looking in Toronto in general. Prices were good and portions were large but most importantly the quality was outstanding."}
{"text":"First off, very attentive service by our server. It was a weeknight and not very busy. My friends and I couldn't stop gabbing the moment we sat down so the server was super patient with us, checking back a few times to take our order.  I really enjoyed the warm mushroom salad. The spinach salad wasn't very special so I would avoid.   Among the group, we ordered braised beef rib papardelle, mushroom risotto and seafood linguine. The beef rib fell off the bone and was tasty but I think it was a poor pairing because the tomato sauce came across very bland.  I had a taste of the risotto, later on realized it's gluten free. It's not for me because I can have gluten. The pulled lamb and mushroom has good flavors, though.   We also ordered creme brulée and tiramisu for desserts. Tiramisu has a nice creme anglaise on top and very fluffy marscapone in the middle and really good size for sharing!  Overall, it's acceptable but it didn't wow me enough to warrant a second visit."}
{"text":"Sundays prefix menu is one of the most popular dinner choices, a choice of  soup, or  choice of 2 salads main: Lamb shank, salmon, or seafood pasta,  with dessert under $30. and always bringing a doggie bag home. I'm always saying I want to try a meal from the menu but always sticking to the old favourite, but the next time I go I will go to the menu... Ferrovia a must try!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with my friends here this evening. I chose this place because it was central to where we all worked and conveniently located along our routes home.  I was more inclined to try because of the reviews... and it was definitely worth it! :)  Great service and really good food. I had the shrimp risotto which was probably the best I've ever had.  And the creme brulee was just right.  It wasn't too sweet.  Some places over do it and make it to sweet.  The restaurant is quaint and cozy.  Lots of parking in the plaza too.   Definitely going to come back :)"}
{"text":"The service was terrible for the past 2 visits. Server absolutely careless, AWEFUL & extremely Rude. Even if we asked for glass of water, she would constantly snap. As if she didn't know what her job title entails....This place is A DISASTER & definitely over rated."}
{"text":"I still can't find any faults with this place. I'll just have to keep trying, no matter how many visits it takes. ;)  The food and service are impeccable. Even the simplest dishes have a certain elegance and tons of flavour."}
{"text":"Our department came for lunch.  The food was still good, but the services was slow with only 1 server. The kitchen might be really understaffed cause it took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive.  I still recommend this place; I just wonder why the store front and the kitchen are so understaffed even in busy December season."}
{"text":"On the plus side - the food was good. I had the lamb shank, and my wife the penne. No complaints about either. And our waiter was attentive. The portion sizes were a bit smaller than I was expecting but I didn't leave hungry. I guess that since t I had just come back from the US a few days earlier, I was spoiled by the ridiculously large portion sizes down there. The warm bread that was given to us at the start was alright, although an offer to refill it would have been appreciated.  On the negative side, while the waiter who served us was friendly and attentive, the hostess who seated us could be kindly described as rudely indifferent. She barely looked at us when we checked in, curtly told us to follow us to our table, and upon seeing that we didn't have a wine list at the table already, she took one from an adjacent table and practically threw it at us.  Regarding some of the other reviews that I found here: On 2/13/17, \"Fred D\" complained that the server did not give the price of the specials but that the manager said he would instruct the staff to do so going forward. Well, our waiter didn't get the memo, and apparently neither did the ones that were within earshot of my table, as they all recited the specials but none mentioned any prices. In another review, \"Cindy L\" on 9/5/15 must have had the same hostess that we did. While I found her rudely indifferent, she seemed very friendly with other customers, likely the regulars. She certainly didn't make me feel very welcome there. And on 5/13/15, \"Jo Jo C\" described the banana bread pudding as \"better than sex\". It was alright, but if she thinks it's better than sex, she needs a new partner."}
{"text":"The food here is great but I find it over priced.  Seafood linguine for $18.95 - (3 large shrimp, 5 oysters, some small scallops and squid. Noodles were cooked perfectly which made it a bit chewy just the way I like them and sauce was very flavorful (4 stars)  Arugula salad with veal and mash potato for $16.95 - didn't like this all that much as the sauce for the veal was not really my taste. The dressing on the salad was good but overall I found this dish a complete rip-off. I went to a grocery later on and found a pack of arugula for $4. I know the restaurant needs to make money too but for $17 I was expecting much more (2 stars)  Asparagus cream soup $5.95 - this was the soup of the day and it was really tasty but nothing really worth noting (3 stars)  Meal also came with some bread and some kind of spread which I really can't describe the taste  Service was fairly good for one person serving the whole restaurant but the place isn't really that big with maybe around 15 tables or so. Lots of parking available."}
{"text":"Lovely Italian restaurant in Thornhill with a nice menu, great specials and a very reasonable price point. The space is intimate and perfect for a small social gathering or a date. Service is top notch and the food is delicious.  We started with the calamari appetizer which was a huge portion with tender and juice calamari with a delicious salad in vinaigrette.   I had the pappardelle pasta which comes with two braised beef chunks. The flavours were amazing! Pasta has just the right bite and the portion was huge. But seriously  how many times does s girl have to wipe her mouth in one meal? So tasty but messy.  I'll definitely be back. Want to try more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Mushroom salad fresh gnocchi that reminds me of that prepared by an Italian grandmother. They are excellent with my daughter's allergies."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend. He found this place while he was searching for a nice restaurant.  Indeed, it was a great choice! He made reservations on the same week, and good thing he did because several people were turned away that Saturday night!  AMBIANCE: The ambiance had dim lighting, and it was a cozy little restaurant hidden away in the plaza near Longo's. The waitstaff were very friendly and attentive.  FOOD: I had ordered the sirloin steak and my boyfriend had ordered a full rack of lamb. Both were delicious and well-cooked. The lamb was just divine! Didn't taste gamey and it was so tender. We also ordered the grilled calamari as an appetizer, but it wasn't anything special. In fact, it was hard to chew because they hadn't removed all of the connective tissue from the squid. There also weren't many pieces of it considering it was $13.99. The bread and humus that they serve was tasty though.  Overall, with appetizer, meals, and two beers, the total came to ~$101. It was a great birthday dinner!"}
{"text":"Came here with some friends on a weekend and we had reservations.   I ordered the Fungi pizza (Portobello, cremini and oyster mushrooms, roast garlic and mozzarella). It was alright but nothing special. I did not really like the crust and left it. The good thing about the pizzas is there is a whole wheat gluten free option. I remember having their pasta 3 years ago and didn't feel it was out of this world either. Maybe I should give it another chance later on.   Service was average. Our server was obviously disappointed the group did not order alcohol. Things took a while to come. When we asked for the bill and that it be separated, he was like \"I can only separate it in 3 bills\" (which worked out for us anyway). But his tone was a bit rude.   The place is very cozy. Would love to eat in the patio area next time on a nice hot day.  Don't think we will be coming back in a while."}
{"text":"Inconspicuous location but impressive taste. Like the mussels so much. The tomato sauce was such a good company with the bread. The pizza was tasty and crispy. Besides, desserts were worthy to try."}
{"text":"We were 4 for dinner this week. Two guests who had the pasta special found it very good, although perhaps a little too creamy.  I had the seafood linguini.  It was fine.  Lots of seafood.  Tomato sauce was a good flavour but a little on the watery side.  Pasta was nicely done.  Friend that had the shrimp spaghettini had 4 shrimp in the whole pasta; and portion was quite small.  Flavour was very good.  Prior to the start of the meal, a very fresh french bread, sliced was served with a very nice garlicy Hummus.  We would have preferred a good bread served with good quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Service was friendly although somewhat rushed.  The room is very  nice and warm."}
{"text":"Small gem and great service!   The staff are super friendly and answered all of our questions.  Atmosphere was great - fairly spread out and not cluttered in a corner in whisper distance from other patrons.    Food was actually really great.  My wife ordered the veal and it was cooked great.  I got the beef short ribs and they were a bit charred, but overall very tasty.   There were quite a few specials (in my opinion a bit too many not to be on the menu)....but good selection.  I would definitely venture back there.  Great spot if you live in the area!"}
{"text":"This is a high end Italian restaurant in the Southern pocket of Markham.   I ordered a Pork Tenderloin here that was amazing. Perfectly cooked, moist on the inside and glazed with a slight crisp on the exterior. For dessert I had creme brulee.   Great place to eat, was perfect to take my fiancee to for a nice night out on the town."}
{"text":"I came to this restaurant a handful of times with family/friends.  The first couple times, I thought it was really good - the risotto and fish were tasty .  But after a while, it looked like the quality started to go down hill and it was definitely not worth the price anymore.   I will not be rushing back to this restaurant anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ferrovia Ristorante worth a 4 star for their Prix Fixe Menu.*  Disclaimer: As my boyfriend only eats Seafood Linguine in Tomato Sauce and Caesar Salad when he goes to an Italian Restaurant. Don't ask me why... I still try to figure out why?!  For $23.95, I can just stuff him with the salad and pasta he loves.. and I ended up be the one eating the Gelato!! That's sound like a good deal? I basically tried everything on the Prix Fixe: Salmon, Lamb Shank, Arugula Salad and Bread Pudding...  But he still just want to order the Frutti De Mare and Caesar Salad....  Services can be slow and unattentive especially on Monday nights when only 2 wait staffs are working... They are trying their best but it is hard to cope with all these tables.. half of them for their Prix Fixe!  Ferrovia Ristorante also has a lunch menu which has lighter fare like sandwiches starting $10 or so.  I will definitely be back... or do I have a choice? I can hear my boyfriend saying to me on a Sunday/Monday evening, let's go to Ferrovia!!"}
{"text":"High End Italian Restaurant is hard to survive in this area... where Indian food takes out rules!  Ferrovia Ristorante has been closed for the longest time!  This location still open though! http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ferrovia-ristorante-thornhill"}
{"text":"Hands down the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The food is mediocre at best. Complete and utter disappointment. Better off at home with a bottle of Ragu and store bought pasta. I can't believe this experience. It was the worst!!! Beware !!"}
{"text":"Prix Menu Good Value   Caesar Salad: there is a cheese cracker ontop that's delicious ! Salad crispy and cool.  Lamb Shank : Just ok, very lamby/game flavour wish it had more sides that even out the taste.   Banana Pudding Cake: Mind Blown! So Good...Would just come here for the cake.  Nice cozy ambiance and great service. Just wish main course was a bit better."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a hidden gem.  I have been here numerous times for lunch and dinners and it never disappoints.  Their food is fresh, delicious and so many items are a bond run.  Servers and staff are friendly.  Everything on menu is amazing!!  Their lamb is divine (which I highly recommend as they get it right)"}
{"text":"Really slow service. Nth was served after 30 mins, and we had to ask them to give us bread as we were starving already. My soup finally came out after 45 mins. (Shouldn't they have the soup all prepared already??) After that, they brought out my salad which they screwed up the order, and had to bring it back to the kitchen. Just don't Understand how they took more than one hour just for some soup and salad? Really poor service, Would definitely not go back again..."}
