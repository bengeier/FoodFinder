{"text":"A great new karaoke place that just opened near the UNLV area, just right off the strip. Great place to hang out with friends, eat some food, enjoy some drinks, and sing your heart out!   This place also has a good selection of food with both karaoke classics you see throughout the vegas valley such as pizza and wings, but also some amazing Korean dishes such as jokbal! Everything we tried was delicious and had great flavor.   Highly recommend coming to this place for your next karaoke night out.  P.S. happy hour is from 4PM-8PM with rooms being only $15/hr! Right now there's also a grand opening special of buy 2 soju/beer, get 1 free. Definitely a great deal."}

There are many sitting area outside the each music room to take a rest. Spacious parking lot provides convenient access in comparison to busy Spring Mountain facilities. It is located in convention center, clean and safe.  Highly recommend to all of you !!"}
