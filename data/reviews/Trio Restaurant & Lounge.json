{"text":"Ate at the Sunday's brunch
You won't be disappointed eating at the brunch.
I loved it except the lunch section, meat quality wasn't the best except the shrimps
But fruits, bread, cheese, etc were premium quality
I recommend it.
Good service also."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant.  Great look and feel.  Too bad they made us feel like we weren't welcome here though.  My partner came in with a protein shake from the gym and even though we had already ordered, the manager needed to make a point of coming by to tell us that his protein drink was not welcome.  They literally asked to take it away from him to throw it out?  WTF??  Are you for real Trio?  I understand that you have a policy but your policy is broken.  You are literally telling your paying customers that they are not welcome if they come into your restaurant with an outside beverage?  Let's be honest, there are lots of other places for me to meet clients for lunch and thanks to this move, Trio will not be one of them."}
{"text":"Nice bar and restaurant inside the hotel. Sheila was personable, knowledgeable, and a delight! Our brunch the first morning was confusing. Even though one of us ordered off the menu and I just wanted coffee we were expected to know to help ourselves with no directions from the server. In a foreign country I'd rather not assume, ten minutes later I politely asked and got a snarky 'I can serve you if you like.' I got my own coffee. We ate here two more times throughout our trip and drank here often between going places. Never had a meal but shared appetizers. They were all good. Had the calamari and shrimp twice with a great dipping sauce. We also had the delicious Asian infused wings. Nice place for being inside a hotel and isolated from nearby attractions. This will change within the next two years. The area seems to be developing quickly."}
{"text":"There's wasn't much things on the menu. Went for my birthday dinner, ended up leaving and going to a different restaurant. Overall, the restaurant and lounge was very nice inside."}
{"text":"This was a bad enough experience to prompt me to sign up to yelp to write review about it.

After waiting for about 25 minutes for a veggie pasta dish, it came out with half cooked yellow fettuccine instead of the whole wheat linguini. Had to send it back - but it took at least 20 minutes to get someone's attention. Ordered a salad which was not terrible and asked for the bill right away. It never came so I had to stand by the cash get it printed...an hour and a half for a lousy salad was less than impressive. There will be no next time!"}
{"text":"We got a living social coupon brunch for 2. The booking was no problem. On the day of our reservation, the car would not start so we weren't sure if we could make it. We called the restaurant and asked to move the reservation to a later time, which they accommodated. The restaurant called back to inform us that the buffet was only until 1pm and that they just wanted to let us know that it may not give us enough time to enjoy our meal. We thought this was very considerate of them.

When we arrived, the service staff was courteous and friendly. The selection of food was fantastic. 

I couldn't really give this full stars for 2 things

1. When we called up the living social voucher on the phone, they don't have a scanner and would prefer a printed copy. We had to email the voucher to them but the living social app really doesn't have that functionality, so we ended up \"gifting\" the voucher to Novotel (This restaurant is inside Novotel) so that they can print it out. This was not the fault of the staff but if they were going to use living social or Groupon for promotion, they should consider to make the experience easier for coupon buyers. They did try very hard, but for the first half of the meal it was a bit frustrating coz we were constantly checking to see if they received the email.

2. The variety of food is fantastic, but I stuck mainly with the cold cuts, fruits and salad selections. This is because the hot food like the scrambled eggs, bacons, sausages, etc, were just lukewarm. It's possible that it's due to the patrons not closing the lids after they opend it. The server did, however, promptly go and check on the gas burners when he was informed.

Overall, we enjoy it. I think it could be better and it will be better, because the staff were definitely interested to listen to and help us through the mishaps."}
{"text":"Serves breakast, lunch and dinner. No complaints about the breakfast buffet, plenty of options.

I ordered the Cobb salad with steak on top and it was delicious. Waiter was attentive and friendly. Perfect after a long day at work and just want to stay local."}
{"text":"Reasons of choosing Trio @Novotel Vaughan is Three-parts.

1. SavourYork has choosen Trio to hold their Kick-off Event multiple times.
2. To let the citizens of GTA know there's a world outside of Toronto core.
3. Many dismiss Hotel Restaurants as a possible night-out Dining option.

Welcome all to the first of many future UYE SavourYork Dinners outside Toronto.
The Group of 7 who attended made the Meal even better. We were the Life of Trio.
More than Life, we provided action, entertainment and play-by-play commentary.
A group that's not shy to disturb-the-peace, exactly my kind of crew.   ;D

2-Staffer on the night made the Service sporadic, though pleasant when available.
The Decor and misc. aesthetics are not as polished as the image they set forth.
As we went during the SavourYork event, we all chose the $25.00 Prix-Fixe.
Looks like the Kitchen is good at Local/Western/Italian more than Exotic flavours.
All things considered, the Price/Portion ratio was quite satisfying reasonable.

{"text":"I recently stayed at a nearby hotel that didn't offer full meals, so for three days I trekked across the parking lot to Trio for breakfasts and dinners.  Every meal was delicious with fresh ingredients and reasonable prices. The service provided by Sayim was quick and attentive without being intrusive. The chef even came out to speak with me after I complimented my meal. I'd give 5 Stars but I think the $4 upcharge for an all white omelette is excessive. Otherwise, I highly recommend Trio and next trip, I'll stay at the Novotel Hotel and save the trekking for the forest."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised to find that the dishes are authentically Indonesian as opposed to \"inspired\". I'm always on the lookout for really good ethnic food, and this fits the bill. My shrimp had a nice bite, not sure what spices were used, but it was really good. 
Atmosphere was nice, upscale and quiet. Service was good, as expected for a boutique hotel. 
Would come again and try other dishes. I see several posts on chicken, so curious to see how that is."}
{"text":"Came here for a paint night. Before painting we went to order get our food and drinks at the bar (don't know why they couldn't come to us). Without giving us our bill the bartender told me and my friend our totals. We asked for our bills she said one second and made us pay first. We both had tipped and once we received the bill we realized she had already charged us a mandatory 15% gratuity without telling us (that was why she refused to give us the bill because she wanted to be tipped double the amount!) when we asked about it, she was very rude and said it as a matter of fact. First of all not everyone painting was ordering food or drinks, and we were only there through a third party but they charged us the gratuity as if we were actually a group. They provided no service because we walked up to order, they were rude, and deceiving."}
{"text":"Came here for the Sunday Brunch buffet with a coupon from LivingSocial. I called in the day of to book a table and got it with no problem. Upon arrival, the lovely staff brought us to our table and promptly took our drink order and withing few minute, we were sipping mimosa. The food selection at the buffet was good. There was a little bit of everything for everyone. From pancake, french toast, bacon, sausages, eggs, charcuterie, cheese, risotto, pasta, yogurt, tea, coffee... Food was great and service was fantastic."}
{"text":"UYE!!! Thank you Wayne and Jennifer K for the invite!

Now, I don't typically make a habit of going to restaurants in hotel, but I have to say Trio did impress me a lot with us arriving here for Savour York Region, which is the GTA version of Winterlicious. 

The price was $25 dollars for dinner - quite reasonable and food was quite good. I'll try to break down what I ate - the Caesar salad was good and crisp, maybe not the best I ever had.

The chicken I had was quite good; nice and moist with the right hit of crispness in the skin to make me go happy-eyed.

The dessert was probably knocked the whole thing out of the park - cappuccino Cheesecake was what I look for in a cheesecake; light and fluffy, and it wasn't as heavy a brick as some other cheesecakes places that I know. 

The company was wonderful, and the unofficial entertainment via a live violinist - who was performing pop songs and classical stuff for another event in one of the more private rooms. 

Service was good, they split our bills without asking and kept an attentive but unobtrusive service; which is hard to do at even at the best restaurants."}
{"text":"Found myself at this restaurant a number of times although based in a hotel you would know it restaurant looks great service is pretty good and the food is excellent great open atmosphere but also private enough to have business meetings. Best of all I don't think it'll break your wallet"}
{"text":"Venturing outside of my comfort zone of Toronto is always a gamble, but with the guidance of fellow Yelpers I knew I'd be in good hands to take a chance on some 905 noshing at the Trio Lounge for the Savour York region Festival.

Located inside the Vaughn Novotel, the Trio Lounge was a welcome oasis of a restaurant in a wasteland of strip malls and home reno/industrial compounds.  The restaurant itself is immaculately clean and looked as though it`d recently undergone a modernised renovation.

The portions of food here are plentiful considering that the prix fixe meal cost a mere $25 as part of Savour York Region's restaurant promo.  It was a much welcome change from the Lillipution servings we've sadly become accustomed to from the Winterlicious meals in Toronto.

My order began with the BBQ Soy-Chili Rubbed Chicken Satays with candied ginger, peanut sauce with green mango slaw. There was no hint of the of the mentioned candied ginger, however the mango slaw was delightfully refreshing!  For the entree I feasted on poultry yet again, I'd been eating Vegan the week before so felt it was due time to get my heme iron back on.  The Thyme Roasted Chicken Supreme with Chipotle-Pecan Sauce, Select Vegetables and Roasted Fingerling Potatoes did not dissappoint as the chicken was pleasantly succulent and the skin was the right consistency, right between crisp and chewy.

With such lively company, the dinner became so much more enjoyable as there was much heated banter about the state of current affairs in the Nba, while in the background we had the strains of GnR's \"Sweet Child of Mine\" playing courtesy of the violin music reception playing down the hall.  My apologies to the surrounding diners who'd endured my tempered outbursts of \"Lebron James is a jerk!!!!\"  But I only speak the truth!  :D

Dessert options were two fold, either in the form of Creme Brule or Cheesecake.  Fellow diners beamed about how good the cappuccino and raspberry cheescakes were. While the Coconut & Tahitian Vanilla Crème Brulee proved interesting on paper, the execution was mediocre with a bit too charred of a sucre crust and a dense yolky custard.

Our wait service was very cordial and with our consideration in mind, the staff had our cheques all neatly divied-up in seperate bills for all seven of us that dined, which was a nice touch!

Trio Lounge's credo reads as \"Food, Wine, Pleasure\" and I'm pleased to say that Trio delivered objectively well on it's promises."}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the mushroom/avocado bruschetta to start. It was full of flavour. 
Followed up with the veal shank that was equally tasty. 
Great atmosphere/ambiance. Especially considering its location. 
The only reason I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 star is because the service was slow despite the restaurant not being busy at all."}
{"text":"Savour York Region 2012 give me an opportunity to try out Trio Restaurant & Lounge in Novotel Vaughan.


I usually don't go eat inside a hotel restaurant... I don't know why... but I always think something is lacking and restaurants in hotels are usually meh... unless you are talking about boutique hotels!

Intermission (drinking wine)

The Portion here is great for a prix menu. We ordered everything aside from the veggie option (none of us feel like having whole wheat linguine) and all A-OK. All the orders are regular portion, I ended up sharing with my Yelp friends.

Intermission (sipping wine)

service is excellent! And waitstaffs want to do separate bills for us even before we request that!

$25 prix menu is excellent value! We were full and happy ......... maybe too happy!"}
