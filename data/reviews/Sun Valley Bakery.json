{"text":"This place rocks.  I've eaten at quite a few vietnamese restaurants here in the valley and this is one of the best.  I've had the pho, the rice soup (chao bo), and the steam buns.... all were fantastic!  the location is a bit sketchy but don't let that deter you.  The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is awesome.  Go have a great meal and take some steam buns home for later, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Dear Sun Valley Bakery,  You have a special place in my heart (and stomach). I don't even have to tell you because you already know. My constant trips arise from not being able to stay awake for over a week. \"Bakery\", yes you are. But you also serve an entire menu of DELICIOUS Vietnamese food that surpasses any other in the valley. Yes, I know that is bold of me to say, even on Yelp for everyone to hear, but it is the truth. Everyone, this little diamond in the rut is a wonderful little treasure nestled in the tiny corner of an almost hidden shopping center. This officially serves THE BEST BOBA I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. Pho and Boba crazed as I am, this sweet spot is a gem in Phoenix that I am blessed to have come accross. I urge all fellow pho and boba addicts to swing by and see for yourself. The place is tiny, the shopping center is a bit run down, but if it is amazing pho and the best boba in the state you seek then that you will find. The lady that is always there is such a sweetheart as well and is always happy to see people enter this tiny, happy and special place. Oh yeah, the super low prices don't hurt either. :)"}
{"text":"This Vietnamese Restaurant is located in an older strip mall along with several other Vietnamese, Asian and two Mexican Businesses. As I entered I didn't notice any baked goods for sale so I don't know if they are still a bakery. I also noticed that this restaurant seems to be a mainly Take Out Restaurant possibly due to the air not working well. It appears the air hasn't worked in a long time and a portable air conditioner sits on the floor. This isn't a fancy place and you aren't here for atmosphere only the food.  This place offers Vietnamese Foods I never seen before. I only saw one menu that sits on a table by the cash register. They offer many appetizers one was some sort of tapioca cake with meat or skin. I saw they offer maybe over 20 bowls of noodle soups. Some sort of pig blood porridge, some sort of pickled fish with chicken and rice. On the wall is the Banh Mi Menu. At the time of this review around 20 kinds of Banh Mi Sandwiches are offered and they run in price $3.50 and $4.00. As for beverages I saw a few American Sodas, Gourd Juice and a Soy Beverage.  We ordered Banh Mi Sandwiches and sat at a table. The woman working there seemed very busy boxing up orders. I saw many people passing threw picking up large boxes of food. The sandwiches took a little while to prepare. I received my Sardine Banh Mi Sandwich. It was large and the bread was hot and crusty out of the oven. The bread was a studier texture than from other banh mi sandwiches I had before. I took a bite and thought the Sardine Banh Mi was a delicious sandwich. The meaty fish almost reminded me of jarred tuna. The mixture of tomato and sardine oil soaked into the bread added a lot of flavor and moisture to the sandwich.  My husband had the Steamed Pork Banh Mi. This sandwich had different textures of pork in the sandwich. My husband thought it was different parts in the pig. He said it was a good sandwich but he has a preference for just the meat.   The woman working there seemed very happy to wait on us and was happy that we enjoyed the food.  Rough Gem  Least Expensive Banh Mi Sandwiches I've ever come across. $3.50 & $4.00 Eat here instead of a Drive Threw and get a Taste of Vietnam"}
{"text":"Very good. I have never tried this kind of food before. My partner and I ordered the #16 and 20 and were not disappointed. Both sandwiches were very good and well prepared. The meals were also very cheap. We will definitely stop by again if ever we are passing by this place. Thank you for a great and health lunch! Five stars."}
{"text":"Nom Nom! Awesome Pho and Spring Rolls! Prices are great and staff is super friendly! Stop and try if you're a Pho fanatic like me =)"}
{"text":"This is the best pho you will ever have. They are straight from Vietnam, family owned, no msg, authentic and amazing. Been to los Angeles, little Saigon in Westminster, and all over California. This is by far the best. I send everyone who thinks photan and davang are the best, right here to sun valley to get blown away. Hole in the wall and not super classy or perfect ambiance, but the pho is hands down the BEST. #37 will change your life. The lady who serves is friendly and everyone gets complimentary jasmine tea. Go here. Leave happy."}
{"text":"I \"discovered\" this place via Lee Lee's market -- apparently Sun Valley bakery sells their desserts and snacks to Lee Lee's to sell to their customers.  I was REALLY in the mood for some sticky rice and I traveled to two Asian markets and one Asian bakery before I finally found Sun Valley's sticky rice at Lee Lee's!  At first I was a little hesitant, because the rice was refrigerated and felt a little hard/dry.  I decided to give it a chance anyway.  Note: before eating, put the rice on a microwaveable plate and cover with a damp paper towel.  Microwave for about 45 seconds and the rice is perfect!  I thought it was so tasty and it really hit the spot.  Next on my list is to visit the actual bakery out on 35th Ave.  It'll be a bit of a trek for me, but I'm sure it will be worth it based on the other reviews.  Can't wait!"}
